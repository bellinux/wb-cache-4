25|$|In {{the normal}} {{anatomy of the}} hip joint, the root (the thigh bone) is {{connected}} to the pelvis at the hip joint. The almost spherical end of the femur head (the caput, or caput ossis femoris) fits into the acetabulum (a concave socket located in the pelvis). The bony surfaces of the femur head and of the acetabulum are covered by cartilage. While bones provide the strength necessary to <b>support</b> <b>body</b> weight, cartilage ensures a smooth fit and a wide range of motion. Normal hip function can be affected by congenital conditions such as dysplasia, discussed in this article, trauma, and by acquired diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E

The carrier material is bound {{on the surface of the}} <b>supporting</b> <b>body,</b> and forms a microscale surface layer of the <b>supporting</b> <b>body,</b> where the layer thickness of the microscale surface layer is 20 mu m or less. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The bioreactor (1) for {{the conversion of}} an educt to a product using an biocatalyst, which is reversibly immobilized on and/or in a controllable carrier material (3), comprises a tubular reactor chamber (2), and a <b>supporting</b> <b>body,</b> which is a part of a reactor wall and/or a mounting part and a filling body arranged in the bioreactor during the catalyzed reaction. The carrier material is bound on the surface of the <b>supporting</b> <b>body,</b> and forms a microscale surface layer of the <b>supporting</b> <b>body,</b> where the layer thickness of the microscale surface layer is 20 mu m or less. The carrier material forms a nanoscale surface layer of the <b>supporting</b> <b>body,</b> and is chemically, physically and/or mechanically fixed. The carrier material is fixed to an inner lateral surface of the reactor wall limiting the reactor chamber. The carrier material is bound on a cell fabric, polyethylene film or polypropylene film. The release of the biocatalyst by and/or from the carrier material or the immobilization of the biocatalyst on and/or in the carrier material is controllable by a change of the environmental conditions of the carrier material. The carrier material is fixed onto the <b>supporting</b> <b>body</b> for increasing the mechanical stability on and/or in the <b>supporting</b> <b>body</b> with high mass stability of the carrier material. USE - Bioreactor for the conversion of an educt to a product using a biocatalyst for the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. ADVANTAGE - The bioreactor ensures simple and cost-effective conversion of the educt to the product with high mechanical stability and high service life, and reduces the formation of unwanted by-products, emissions and waste materials...|$|R

40|$|DE 102006022733 A 1 UPAB: 20080102 NOVELTY - The device has a {{light source}} and a refracting device (2), which is {{arranged}} in a housing part (3) that swivels around a rotation axis. The refracting device controls a scanning beam coming from the source as a transmitting beam (6) on an object and controls light portions reflected from the object as a receiving beam (10) in a direction of a detector of a receiving device. The housing part is {{arranged in a}} torque-proof manner at a <b>supporting</b> <b>body</b> (4) that is supported outside the part, where the body is provided with a separate deflecting device (5) for the transmitting beam. USE - Used for a high-speed profilometer for measuring a contour of an object e. g. railway loading gauge, and a light area of a tunnel of a track-bound vehicle. ADVANTAGE - The housing part is arranged in a torque-proof manner at the <b>supporting</b> <b>body</b> that is <b>supported</b> outside the housing part so {{that one of the}} housing part and the <b>supporting</b> <b>body,</b> is moved during application together with a driving force, where a dimension of the housing part does not have impact {{to the size of a}} bearing of the body, thus facilitating utilization of an economical and small bearing with high life span and small thermal power loss. The device enables an improved local resolution of the measuring process or a faster execution of the measurement with continuous resolution. The <b>supporting</b> <b>body</b> is provided with a separate deflecting device for the transmitting beam, thus permitting separation of the optical path lengths of the transmitting and receiving beams of the scanning device and hence reducing the influence of interfering signals to the receiving optics...|$|R
