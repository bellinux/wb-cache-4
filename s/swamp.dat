5|$|Historically, {{there was}} a <b>swamp</b> at the {{headwaters}} of Black Creek. As late as the 1910s, {{the waters of the}} creek were described as coming from mountain springs and a <b>swamp.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Southern <b>Swamp</b> {{contains}} the Deku Palace and the Woodfall Temple, an ancient shrine containing monsters {{and a giant}} masked jungle warrior, Odolwa, who has been poisoning the <b>swamp.</b>|$|E

50|$|It is {{believed}} that <b>swamps</b> such as these formed around 15,000 years ago. The Blue Mountain <b>swamps</b> exist within low‐lying sites on valley floors (valley <b>swamps)</b> and also as hanging <b>swamps</b> which occur on steep hillsides and around the headwaters of creeks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Swamps</b> are {{characterized}} by slow-moving to stagnant waters. They are usually associated with adjacent rivers or lakes. <b>Swamps</b> are features of areas with very low topographic relief. <b>Swamps</b> generate coal as rock.|$|R
50|$|Forested {{wetlands}} {{are generally}} known as <b>swamps.</b> The upper level of these <b>swamps</b> {{is determined by}} high water levels, which are negatively affected by dams. Some <b>swamps</b> can be dominated by a single species, such as silver maple <b>swamps</b> around the Great Lakes. Others, {{like those of the}} Amazon basin, have large numbers of different tree species. Examples include cypress (Taxodium) and mangrove.|$|R
5|$|His tent {{is portrayed}} as a less dark place than the {{emptiness}} outside, and becomes a place of safety and sanctuary. Conversely, the <b>swamp</b> is described in themes that convey it as shrouded in mist at night, and a place Nick deliberately tries not to think about. When he wakes in the morning, regenerated by sleep, he feels stronger and the <b>swamp</b> seems less threatening.|$|E
5|$|The film {{focuses on}} an ogre named Shrek who finds his <b>swamp</b> overrun by fairy tale creatures {{who have been}} banished there by order of the evil Lord Farquaad. In order to get his <b>swamp</b> back, Shrek makes a deal with Farquaad to bring him a queen in {{exchange}} for the deed for his <b>swamp.</b> Shrek sets out with a talking Donkey and rescues Princess Fiona. While they take Fiona to Farquaad so she can marry him, Shrek starts {{to fall in love with}} the princess and soon discovers a shocking secret about her.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, maroons came to live in the Great Dismal <b>Swamp.</b> Most settled on mesic islands, the high and dry parts of the <b>swamp.</b> Inhabitants included slaves who had purchased their freedom as well as escaped slaves. Other escaped slaves used the <b>swamp</b> as a route on the Underground Railroad {{as they made their way}} further north. Some slaves lived there in semi-free conditions, but how much independence slaves actually enjoyed there has been a topic of much debate. Nearby whites often left enslaved maroons alone so long as they paid a quota in logs or shingles, and businesses may have ignored the fugitive nature of escaped slaves who provided work in exchange for trade goods.|$|E

40|$|The palm Raphia taedigera Mart, forms vast, monodominant <b>swamps</b> in Central and South America, {{but very}} {{little is known about}} the ecology and natural history of these ecosystems. Debate {{surrounds}} the issue whether R. taedigera <b>swamps</b> are early successional stages or mature “climax” communities. This paleoecological analysis of a 1. 46 -m sediment core from <b>swamps</b> on the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua establishes the abundant presence of R. taedigera <b>swamps</b> for at least 2800 ± 90 years. R. taedigera <b>swamps</b> must be considered persistent communities, warranting further study because of their great extension into Central and South America...|$|R
5|$|Banksia ilicifolia is a {{component}} of the critically endangered Assemblage of Tumulus Springs (organic mound springs) of the Swan Coastal Plain community north of Perth, which is characterised by a permanently moist peaty soil. The dominant trees include M. preissiana, <b>swamp</b> banksia (B. littoralis) and flooded gum (Eucalyptus rudis), with understorey ferns such as bracken (Pteridium esculentum) and Cyclosorus interruptus, and shrubs <b>swamp</b> peppermint (Taxandria linearifolia) and Astartea fascicularis.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{possible}} single-egg clutch and the bird's large size, it has been proposed that the dodo was K-selected, meaning that it produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required parental care until they matured. Some evidence, including the large size {{and the fact that}} tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates, indicates that the bird may have had a protracted development period. The fact that no juvenile dodos have been found in the Mare aux Songes <b>swamp</b> may indicate that they produced little offspring, that they matured rapidly, that the breeding grounds were far away from the <b>swamp,</b> or that the risk of miring was seasonal.|$|E
5|$|Despite problems, the Deutsche Reichsbahn made {{improvements}} to the line and reconstructed at great expense the Westkreuz railway station which had been built on <b>swamp</b> land.|$|E

50|$|The <b>swamps</b> play an {{important}} hydrological role within the mountains landscapes, controlling and regulating the movement of water. The sponge-like nature of the <b>swamps</b> which sustains flows into surrounding streams, has multiple effects on the water quality reaching these streams. <b>Swamps</b> help reduce water turbidity, and enhance overall stream water quality. Some plant species with specialized habitats rely on the ongoing seepage from the hanging <b>swamps</b> for their survival. Examples of these are Epacris hamiltonii and Microstrobos fitzgeraldii.|$|R
5|$|In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published}} a new arrangement for the genus, after cladistic analyses yielded a cladogram {{significantly different from}} George's arrangement. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement retained B.brownii in series Spicigerae, placing it in B.subser. Occidentales along with B.occidentalis (red <b>swamp</b> banksia), B.seminuda (river banksia), B.verticillata (granite banksia) and B.littoralis (<b>swamp</b> banksia). This arrangement stood until 1999, when George effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the Flora of Australia series.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, after {{a hundred}} years of neglect, {{a part of the}} Mare aux Songes <b>swamp</b> was {{excavated}} by an international team of researchers (International Dodo Research Project). To prevent malaria, the British had covered the <b>swamp</b> with hard core during their rule over Mauritius, which had to be removed. Many remains were found, including bones of at least 17 dodos in various stages of maturity (though no juveniles), and several bones obviously from the skeleton of one individual bird, which have been preserved in their natural position. These findings were made public in December 2005 in the Naturalis museum in Leiden. 63% of the fossils found in the <b>swamp</b> belonged to turtles of the extinct Cylindraspis genus, and 7.1% belonged to dodos, which had been deposited within several centuries, 4,000 years ago. Subsequent excavations suggested that dodos and other animals became mired in the Mare aux Songes while trying to reach water during a long period of severe drought about 4,200 years ago. Furthermore, cyanobacteria thrived in the conditions created by the excrements of animals gathered around the <b>swamp,</b> which died of intoxication, dehydration, trampling, and miring. Though many small skeletal elements were found during the recent excavations of the <b>swamp,</b> few were found during the 19th century, probably owing to the employment of less refined methods when collecting.|$|E

50|$|Near Mońki {{there are}} some of the {{greatest}} <b>swamps</b> in Europe, the Biebrza River <b>Swamps,</b> and in 1993 the government created the Biebrza National Park (BNP) to recognise and protect their unique nature. The Biebrza River <b>Swamps</b> are an important habitat for rare birds such as the ruff (pol. batalion), which is a symbol of the BNP.|$|R
5|$|On {{hearing the}} ambush in the distance, Dodge hurried on toward Fort Hamilton (present-day Wiota, Wisconsin) where he {{gathered}} together {{a company of}} 29 mounted volunteers and sped off to intercept the attackers. He led the chase through tangled underbrush until, breaking into prairie, his force {{caught sight of the}} raiding party. The Kickapoo crossed the Pecatonica River within sight of the pursuing militia, and entered into an overgrown <b>swamp.</b> The militia followed across the swollen river and dismounted when they reached the <b>swamp.</b>|$|E
