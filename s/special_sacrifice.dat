Still they would have been a little less inclined to disregard it than if they had not received their first lesson; and there can be no doubt that if Mary were to continue her training in the same spirit in which she commenced it she would, before many weeks, acquire a complete ascendency over them, and make them entirely submissive to her will.|$|E

At any rate, when I told him, the night before I {{intended}} going, that I meant to leave him in the morning, he seemed resigned, or indifferent, or perhaps merely inattentive. From time to time we had recurred to the matter of his experience, or his delusion, but with apparently increasing impatience on his part, and certainly decreasing interest on mine; so that at last I think {{he was willing to}} have me go. But in the morning he seemed reluctant, and pleaded with me to stay a few days longer with him. I alleged engagements, more or less unreal, for I was never on such terms with Alderling that I felt I need make any <b>special</b> <b>sacrifice</b> to him. He gave way, suspiciously, rather, and when I came down from my room after having put the last touches to my packing, I found him on the veranda looking out to seaward, where a heavy fog-bank hung.|$|E

As she sat there looking out into the garden indistinct ideas of what were a mother's duties to her child lay heavy on her mind,--ideas which were very indistinct, but which were not on that account the less {{powerful}} in their operation.

Mrs. Prime would undertake such a task with much more skill and power of language than she could use. But then would this be fair to Rachel, and would Rachel obey her sister? Any explicit direction from herself,--if only she could bring herself to give any,--Rachel would, she thought, obey. In this way she resolved that she would break the ice and do her duty.|$|E
6000|$|The Mexican calendar, [...] "the Aztec year," [...] as {{described}} at considerable length by Sahagun, was {{a succession of}} feasts, marked by minute and elaborate rites of a magical character. The gods of rain were frequently propitiated, so was the goddess of maize, the mountain god, {{the mother of the}} gods, and many other divinities. The general theory of worship was the adoration of a deity, first by innumerable human sacrifices, next by the <b>special</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of a man for male gods, of a woman for each goddess. The latter victims were regarded as the living images or incarnations of the divinities in each case; for no system of worship carried farther the identification of the god with the sacrifice, and of both with the officiating priest. The connection was emphasised by the priest's wearing the newly-flayed skins of the victims, just as in Greece, Egypt and Assyria the fawn-skin, or bull-hide, or goat-skin, or fish-skin of the victims is worn by the celebrants. Finally, an image of the god was made out of paste, and this was divided into morsels and eaten in a hideous sacrament by those who communicated.* ...|$|E

6000|$|They [...] "saw," [...] all genially and generously--for I must {{add that}} I had made, {{to the best}} of my recollection, no morbid scruple of not blabbing about Gyp and her strange incitement. I the more boldly held my tongue over this that the more I, by my intelligence, lived in my {{arrangement}} and moved about in it, the more I sank into satisfaction. It was clearly to work to a charm and, during this process--by calling at every step for an exquisite management--"to haunt, to startle and waylay." [...] Each of my [...] "lamps" [...] would be the light of a single [...] "social occasion" [...] in the history and intercourse of the characters concerned, and would bring out to the full the latent colour of the scene in question and cause it to illustrate, to the last drop, its bearing on my theme. I revelled in this notion of the Occasion as a thing by itself, really and completely a scenic thing, and could scarce name it, while crouching amid the thick arcana of my plan, with a large enough O. The beauty of the conception was in this approximation of the respective divisions of my form to the successive Acts of a Play--as to which it was more than ever a case for charmed capitals. The divine distinction of the act of a play--and a greater than any other it easily succeeds in arriving at--was, I reasoned, in its special, its guarded objectivity. This objectivity, in turn, when achieving its ideal, came from the imposed absence of that [...] "going behind," [...] to compass explanations and amplifications, to drag out odds and ends from the [...] "mere" [...] storyteller's great property-shop of aids to illusion: a resource under denial of which it was equally perplexing and delightful, for a change, to proceed. Everything, for that matter, becomes interesting from the moment it has closely to consider, for full effect positively to bestride, the law of its kind. [...] "Kinds" [...] are the very life of literature, and truth and strength come from the complete recognition of them, from abounding to the utmost in their respective senses and sinking deep into their consistency. I myself have scarcely to plead the cause of [...] "going behind," [...] which is right and beautiful and fruitful in its place and order; but as the confusion of kinds is the inelegance of letters and the stultification of values, so to renounce that line utterly and do something quite different instead may become in another connexion the true course and the vehicle of effect. Something in the very nature, in the fine rigour, of this <b>special</b> <b>sacrifice</b> (which is capable of affecting the form-lover, I think, as really more of a projected form than any other) lends it moreover a coercive charm; a charm that grows in proportion as the appeal to it tests and stretches and strains it, puts it powerfully to the touch. To make the presented occasion tell all its story itself, remain shut up in its own presence and yet on that patch of staked-out ground become thoroughly interesting and remain thoroughly clear, is a process not remarkable, no doubt, so long as a very light weight is laid on it, but difficult enough to challenge and inspire great adroitness so soon as the elements to be dealt with begin at all to [...] "size up." ...|$|E

2500|$|Milgrom {{taught that}} the {{rationale}} for the sin or purification offering in [...] was related to the impurity generated by violations of prohibitive commandments, which, if severe enough, polluted the sanctuary from afar. Milgrom called this pollution the Priestly Picture of Dorian Gray: While sin might not scar the face of the sinner, it did scar the face of the sanctuary. This image illustrated a Priestly version of the doctrine of collective responsibility: When evildoers sinned, they brought the more righteous down with them. Those who perished with the wicked were not entirely blameless, but inadvertent sinners who, by having allowed the wicked to flourish, also contributed to pollution of the sanctuary. The High Priest and the leaders of the people, in particular, brought <b>special</b> <b>sacrifices</b> in [...] and , for their errors caused harm to their people, as reflected in [...] and [...] Thus, in the Priestly scheme, brazen sins (the leaders' rapacity) and inadvertent sins (the silent majority's acquiescence) polluted the sanctuary (and corrupted society), driving God out of the sanctuary and leading to national destruction. In the theology of the purification offering, the sanctuary needed constant purification lest God abandon it because of the people's rebellious and inadvertent sins.|$|R
60|$|Eurybiades, the commander-in-chief, {{if he was}} not {{convinced}} by the arguments that Themistocles had offered, was alarmed at his declaration that the Athenian ships would abandon the cause of the Greeks if the fleet abandoned Salamis; he accordingly gave his voice very decidedly for remaining where they were. The rest of the officers finally acquiesced in this decision, and the council broke up, the various members of it returning each to his own command. It was now nearly morning. The whole fleet had been, necessarily, during the night in a state of great excitement and suspense, all anxious to learn the result of these deliberations. The awe and solemnity which would, of course, pervade the minds of men at midnight, while such momentous questions were pending, were changed to an appalling sense of terror, toward the dawn, by an earthquake which then took place, and which, as is usually the case with such convulsions, not only shook the land, but was felt by vessels on the sea. The men considered this phenomenon as a solemn warning from heaven, and measures were immediately adopted for appeasing, by certain <b>special</b> <b>sacrifices</b> and ceremonies, the divine displeasure which the shock seemed to portend.|$|R

5000|$|Indeed, while certain sources do {{mention that}} the king kept a cohort of {{religious}} advisers to consult in regards to various religious matters, the king remained a power unto himself for {{the simple fact that}} he bore the results of his actions and decisions, an idea grounded in the reciprocity shared between the king and his subjects: the king's salvation [...] "depends on his subjects, for he suffers the consequences of their sins and profits from the merits they acquire". Similarly, his subjects depend on him, for if he [...] "protects them as he should," [...] his people may devote themselves [...] "to their duties". Moreover, while power was increasingly located within the king, his role was maintained within a set of boundaries and the role he played within society did not extend into previously untouched areas. For example, within the matter of spiritual salvation (i.e. moksa), the king played no direct role at all; it is not his responsibility to [...] "propound any superstitious idea, to lay down any part of righteousness," [...] or to help define [...] "what is or is not religion" [...] nor determine its practice. On the contrary, the king was to act as the enforcer and sometimes intermediary through which the [...] "imperial sacrificial ceremonies" [...] occurred. Indeed, a special [...] "affinity with the gods," [...] most notably Indra, resulting from his role in personally conducting <b>special</b> <b>sacrifice</b> and ensuring others likewise performed the rites is mentioned as a source of the king's authority. Examples of such sacrifices include the Rajasuya ("the king's inauguration sacrifice"), the Asvamedha ("the horse sacrifice"), and the Aindramahabhisheka ("The Great Consecration of Indra").|$|E
2500|$|According to Rabbi Nehemiah, {{this is how}} the {{exchange}} went: Moses asked Aaron why he had not eaten the sacrifice. Moses asked Aaron whether perhaps the blood of the sacrifice had entered the innermost sanctuary, but Aaron answered that its blood had not entered into the inner sanctuary. Moses asked Aaron whether perhaps the blood had passed outside the sanctuary courtyard, but Aaron replied that it had not. Moses asked Aaron whether perhaps the priests had offered it in bereavement, and thus disqualified the offering, but Aaron replied that his sons had not offered it, Aaron had. Thereupon Moses exclaimed that Aaron should certainly have eaten it, as Moses had commanded in [...] that they should eat it in their bereavement. Aaron replied with [...] and argued that perhaps what Moses had heard was that it was allowable for those in mourning to eat the <b>special</b> <b>sacrifices</b> for the Inauguration of the Tabernacle, but not the regular ongoing sacrifices. For if [...] instructs that the tithe, which is of lesser holiness, cannot be eaten in mourning, how much more should that prohibition apply to sacrifices like the sin-offering that are more holy. When Moses heard that argument, he replied with [...] that it was pleasing to him, and he admitted his error. Moses did not seek to excuse himself by saying that he had not heard the law from God, but admitted that he had heard it and forgot it.|$|R
40|$|A {{small group}} of heathen Votyaks living {{on the other side}} of the Kama river (in the Northwest Bashkiria and in the Kuyeda region of the Perm oblast) still hold on to the ancient heathen {{religion}} which has been influenced by the developing world religions. The current article observes the sacrificial customs in the religion of the Votyak {{on the other side of}} the Kama in the context of ritual behaviour. In some cases it also views the traditional customs of other Votyak ethnic and ethnographic groups. The sacrifice had, and still has, an important role in nearly every Votyak ritual, whether it be collective or daily, random or <b>special.</b> Collective <b>sacrifice</b> was performed, and still is, on certain holidays of popular calendar, on family and kindred festivities. <b>Special</b> collective <b>sacrifice</b> was performed in case of bigger emergencies in the village or the region. Every sacrifice irrespective of the type of the ritual had its organisers: sacrificial priests and their assistants. Every ritual procedure had a specific site and structure. The family sacrifice had an significant role as well, it was performed at the beginning and finishing major works and at important family events. Individual sacrificial rites which in some way influence the whole surrounding world were performed, if necessity called, any time and anywhere. The offerings of the Votyaks on the other side of the Kama could be divided in two groups: food and other objects. Almost all the types of the offerings described by the earlier researchers have been preserved until today. Still, the sacrifice of horses and cattle is performed very rarely, also the custom of sacrificing wild fowl and silver coins is almost obsolete. The former offerings are replaced by inexpensive and easily accessible objects...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, judges and legislators {{in a number of}} states have {{recognized}} significant shortcomings in the ways traditional systems of criminal corrections address cases involving criminal offenders who are veterans of the U. S. armed services. This recognition has come at a time when policy-makers have similarly recognized that, for certain subsets of criminal offenders, “diversionary” programs may achieve better policy results than will traditional criminal punishment. In accordance with these dual recognitions, some states have implemented systems of veterans’ courts, in which certain offenders, who are also U. S. veterans, are diverted into programs that provide monitoring, training, and occupational and psychological counseling in lieu of imprisonment. Because these veterans’ courts have been created on an ad hoc, state-by-state basis, it remains unclear exactly how such courts should be implemented in order to be most effective. This Note argues that the evidence currently available suggests that veterans’ courts are a good policy choice, in that they can have a positive impact on state criminal systems by reducing recidivism among offenders and by conserving state resources. Accordingly, this Note argues, states should pursue diversionary programs for at least some subset of U. S. veterans because: (1) the U. S. government has already invested significant resources in training veterans and helping them to develop skills; (2) in many cases the behavior that leads to a veteran being incarcerated stems at least in part from service-related trauma, suggesting that addressing the trauma may correct the behavior; and (3) as a matter of equity, those who have served in defense of the United States may be due special consideration in light of their <b>special</b> <b>sacrifices.</b> This said, given the difficulties inherent in determining which veterans, in which cases, should be afforded the benefits of these diversionary programs, that there is no coordinated state action in this area, and that many of the potential benefits of veterans’ courts can best—or perhaps only—be realized through a standardized, uniform model, the federal government should promulgate standards for implementing such programs in state court systems...|$|R

The Mussaf service is technically a separate, free-standing service which could potentially be said any time between the shacharit (morning) and mincha (afternoon) services, but today is normally recited immediately after the regular morning service as part of single, but extended, worship session. The Mussaf Amidah begins with the same first three and concludes with the same last three blessings as the regular Amidah. However, {{in place of the}} 13 intermediate blessings of the daily service, special prayers are added for the holiday.

The biblical passage referring to the Mussaf sacrifice of the day is included. The Priestly Blessing is said during the Reader's repetition of the Amidah. Outside the land of Israel, the Mussaf Amidah of major Jewish holidays is the only time the Priestly Blessing is chanted by actual kohanim (priests).|$|R

Ultimately, the earth said that Shesha, the serpent who carries the earth and the worlds on his hoods, is the most powerful; Balarama would be Shesha's most powerful form. Jyotishmati went to Vindhya mountains and performed tapas(austerities) to marry Balarama. Numerous deities tried to dissuade her and win her over as wife, however she cursed all of them. In counter-curse, Indra cursed Jyotishmati that she would not have sons. Finally, Brahma pleased with her penance blessed her that she would marry Balarama, but warned that he would be born 27 yugas(eons) later. An enraged Jyotishmati threatened to curse Brahma too. He pacified her by giving her another boon that she would be born as Revati, daughter of King Kakudmi, whose actions would lead to the 27 eons passing in a jiffy.|$|R
