5|$|Morris found batting {{difficult}} {{for the first few}} weeks of the tour, as he struggled to adapt to the unfamiliar batting conditions. He reached 50 only twice in the nine innings after the Worcestershire match, totalling only 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared <b>suddenly,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{marked his}} {{first-class}} debut on English soil with a fluent 138 against Worcestershire, which was scored in only {{four hours and}} made him the first Australian centurion on tour. Morris found batting difficult {{for the first few}} weeks as he adapted to the alien batting conditions, reaching 50 only twice in his next nine innings with a total of 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared <b>suddenly</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease. He rectified this, and success followed with 184 against Sussex in the final match before the First Test. Five more centuries {{before the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of this origin of Chamba {{is that it}} originated as a hermitage which Champavati, a devout Hindu, used to frequent. The king, being suspicious of his daughter's fidelity, one day investigated and followed her to the hermitage, but surprisingly he found neither his daughter nor the hermit there. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> said to have heard a voice which informed him that his suspicions were ill-founded, admonishing him and informing him that his daughter had been taken away from him permanently as a punishment for his lack of trust in her morals. The King, fully chastened, sought redemption for his sin by expanding the hermitage into a temple, named in his daughter’s honour and built a city around the temple. Today this temple, called the Champavati Temple, belongs to the Royal family and the King’s daughter is venerated as a goddess. Every year, since 935, the Minjar festival or fair has been held. It lasts for 21 days, coinciding with {{the first day of}} Baisakhi.|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} {{combined}} with live footage. It {{is about an}} artist working in his studio. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> disturbed by a small paper person jumping out of the page causing an uproar. The artist in the footage was Wan Guchan.|$|R
6000|$|Verena {{saw that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> more serious now than <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> before, that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not piling it up satirically, but saying really and a trifle wearily, as if <b>suddenly</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> tired of much talk, what he meant. [...] "To save it from what?" [...] she asked.|$|R

5|$|In 1991 France met eternal arch-rivals England in the quarterfinal at Parc des Princes. Earlier in {{the year}} at Twickenham the two sides had played off for the Five Nations Grand Slam. The French scored three {{magnificent}} tries but were denied by the fearsome English forward pack. In a very tense and brutally physical match, the scores were tied at 10-all when the French were awarded a scrum five metres out from the tryline. French number eight Marc Cecillon looked set to score the try that would have won the game for the French. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> hit and driven back in a tackle from opponent Mick Skinner, a tackle which changed {{the momentum of the}} match. England went on to win 19–10 and eventually reached the Final. At the end of the match, France coach Daniel Dubroca angrily assaulted New Zealand referee David Bishop in the players tunnel. He resigned soon afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Sturt's health {{had been}} very {{variable}} and on 16 June 1869 he died <b>suddenly.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> survived by his widow, two sons, Colonel Napier George Sturt, R.E. and Major-General Charles Sheppey Sturt, and daughter Charlotte. Mrs Sturt was granted a civil list pension of £80 a year, and the queen granted her the title of Lady Sturt as if her husband's nomination to a knighthood {{of the order of}} St Michael and St George had been gazetted. Reproductions of portraits by Crossland and Koberwein will be found in Mrs N. G. Sturt's Life, which suggest the charm and refinement of Sturt's character.|$|E
25|$|Despite poor health, Grand Duke Andrei {{lived to}} be 77 years old, an age reached by few in the Romanov family. He surpassed the {{longevity}} record held by his great-uncle, Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich, by almost six months. On the morning of 31 October 1956, Grand Duke Andrei worked in his study. Having finished a letter on his typewriter, he felt dizzy, went to his bed to lie down and died <b>suddenly.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> buried wearing the uniform of the Horse Guard Artillery Brigade, which he had commanded during World War I. Matilda Kshesinskaya died in Paris in December 1971 at age 99. Prince Vladimir Romanovsky-Krasinsky died unmarried and childless in France in 1974, three years after his mother.|$|E

25|$|On 6 July, he {{was flying}} one of eight Spitfires that were {{scrambled}} to intercept three Italian Cant bombers and 30 Macchi 202s, Italy's top-line fighter. The eight Spitfires dived straight into the Italians. In seconds, with one burst Beurling had damaged a bomber. Then, <b>suddenly</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> on {{the tail of a}} Macchi whose pilot (probably Sergente Maggiore Francesco Pecchiari from 51° Stormo), spotting the Spitfire, plunged into a dive. The Canadian chased his prey for 15,000 ft and, when the Italian pulled up at 5,000, Beurling let go a two-second burst from 300 yards away. It was a perfect hit. Although he wasn't aware that he had been fired on, when Beurling inspected his Spitfire back at Takali, he found it riddled with bullets. Undaunted, that evening, just before dusk, he was in the air again in a patrol of four Spitfires. Radar had shown two German JU 88s and 20 Messerschmitts Bf 109Fs, heading towards Malta. After the four Spitfires dived and split up the formation, Beurling followed a fighter trying to escape at low level over the sea. After he laid down a two-second burst the German crashed into the Mediterranean.|$|E
500|$|Membership in the Sex Pistols had a {{progressively}} destructive {{effect on}} Vicious. As Lydon later observed, [...] "Up to that time, Sid was absolutely childlike. Everything was fun and giggly. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a big pop star. Pop star status meant press, {{a good chance}} to be spotted in all the right places, adoration. That's what it all meant to Sid." [...] Westwood had already been feeding him material, like a tome on Charles Manson, likely to encourage his worst instincts. Early in 1977, he met Nancy Spungen, an emotionally disturbed drug addict and sometime prostitute from New York. Spungen is commonly thought to be responsible for introducing Vicious to heroin, and the emotional codependency between the couple alienated Vicious from {{the other members of the}} band. Lydon later wrote, [...] "We did everything to get rid of Nancy.... She was killing him. I was absolutely convinced this girl was on a slow suicide mission.... Only she didn't want to go alone. She wanted to take Sid with her.... She was so utterly fucked up and evil." [...] Lydon also admits to regretting introducing the two in The Filth and the Fury.|$|E
500|$|In 1926 Takeshita invited Ueshiba {{to visit}} Tokyo again. Ueshiba relented and {{returned}} to the capital, but while residing there was stricken with a serious illness. Deguchi visited his ailing student and, concerned for his health, commanded Ueshiba to return to Ayabe. The appeal of returning increased after Ueshiba was questioned by the police following his meeting with Deguchi; the authorities were keeping the Ōmoto-kyō leader under close surveillance. Angered at the treatment he had received, Ueshiba went back to Ayabe again. Six months later, this time with Deguchi's blessing, he and his family moved permanently to Tokyo. This move allowed Ueshiba to teach politicians, high-ranking military personnel, and members of the Imperial household; <b>suddenly</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> no longer an obscure provincial martial artist, but a sensei to some of Japan's most important citizens. Arriving in October 1927, the Ueshiba family set up home in the Shirokane district. The building proved too small to house the growing number of aikido students, and so the Ueshibas moved to larger premises, first in Mita district, then in Takanawa, and finally to a purpose-built hall in Shinjuku. This last location, originally named the Kobukan (...) , would eventually become the Aikikai Hombu Dojo. During its construction, Ueshiba rented a property nearby, where he was visited by Kanō Jigorō, the founder of judo.|$|E
