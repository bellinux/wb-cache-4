500|$|In 2015, McAdams starred with Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Stanley Tucci as {{journalist}} Sacha Pfeiffer in Tom McCarthy's Spotlight, Academy Award's Best Picture winner drama, {{about the}} child-abuse scandal in Boston's Catholic Church. To prepare for her role, McAdams {{spent time with}} Pfeiffer. The movie garnered universal critical acclaim, mainly for its detailed story and the cast performances. Justin Chang of Variety felt she [...] "imbues Pfeiffer with sensitivity and grit." [...] Nonetheless, he was surprised by McAdams' subsequent Academy Award nomination: [...] " [...] has the sort of fine-grained subtlety that voters too rarely notice. Take another look at that scene in which <b>she</b> <b>gently,</b> skillfully encourages an abuse survivor to lay bare his most lacerating secrets—a small master class in how {{the simple act of}} listening can become a conduit for compassion." [...] For her role, McAdams received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actress and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations in the categories of Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role and Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.|$|E
