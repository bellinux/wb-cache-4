25|$|In 1845, 24% of all Irish tenant farms were of 0.4–2hectares (1–5acres) in size, while 40% were of 2–6hectares (5–15acres). Holdings were {{so small}} that no crop other than {{potatoes}} would suffice to feed a family. Shortly before the famine the British government reported that poverty was so widespread that one-third of all Irish small holdings could not support their families after paying their rent, except by earnings of <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrant</b> labour in England and Scotland. Following the famine, reforms were implemented making it illegal to further divide land holdings.|$|E

30|$|According to Simon (1979), {{the figure}} of Tunisians who {{migrated}} during this period is certainly higher, between 200, 000 and 300, 000, {{due to the fact}} that <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrants</b> and naturalized migrants are not counted or counted separately.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, a {{new trend}} of {{seasonal}} labour migration from Armenia to Russia has emerged. Based on a novel household survey, this paper analyses how successful <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrants</b> are in increasing their incomes. Applying matching operators allows addressing endogenous self-selection to migration. We identify negative selection based on education, employment and pre-migration income. This is reflected by a premium for low skills in Russia relative to Armenia, luring <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrants</b> into low-skill jobs, mainly in the construction sector. The income gain for a migrant is estimated at $ 480 relative to the approximately $ 50 that the same individual would have earned in Armenia. The results are robust to various matching techniques and specifications...|$|R

Seasonal migration by retirees may be an intermediate step between tourism and permanent migration. A {{review of the literature}} on seasonal migration finds that some <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrants</b> become permanent <b>migrants.</b> In general, <b>seasonal</b> and permanent <b>migrants</b> come from two separate migration streams and are two different lifestyles. Seasonal migration generally does not lead to permanent migration. ...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{transition}} (DoiMoi) in the 1980 s in Viet Nam has led {{to internal}} migration, particularly rural-to-urban migration. Many studies suggested {{that there is a}} difference between non-migrants and migrants in using health care services. Current studies have mostly focused on migrants working in industrial zones (IZs) but migrants working in private small enterprises (PSEs) and <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrants</b> seem to be ignored. However, these two groups of migrants are more vulnerable in health care access than others because they usually work without labor contracts and have no health insurance. The study aims to compare the utilization of health care services and explore its correlated factors among these three groups.; This cross-sectional study included 1800 non-migrants and migrants aged 18 - 55 who were selected through stratified sampling in Long Bien and Ba Dinh districts, Hanoi. These study sites consist of large industrial zones and many slums where most <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrants</b> live in. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information on health service utilization in the last 6 months before the study. Utilization of heath care services was identified as "an ill person who goes to health care centers to seek any treatment (i. e. both private and public health care centers) ".; 644 of 1800 participants reported having a health problem in the last 6 months before the study. Among these 644 people, 335 people used health care services. The percentage of non-migrants using health care service was the highest (67. 6 %), followed by migrants working in IZ (53. 7 %), migrants working in PSE (44 %), and <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrants</b> (42 %). Multivariate logistic regression showed <b>migrants,</b> especially <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrants</b> and migrants working in PSE, were less likely to use health care services (OR= 0. 35, p= 0. 016 and 0. 38, p= 0. 004, respectively), compared to non-migrants. The study also found that having no health insurance was a risk factor of the utilization (OR= 0. 29, p< 0. 001). Other factors such as gender, age, marital status, socioeconomic status, and monthly income were not related to the utilization of health care services.; <b>Seasonal</b> <b>migrants</b> have the worst utilization of health care services, followed by migrants working in PSE, migrants working in IZ, and non-migrants. Health insurance is an important factor relating to the utilization. Accordingly, health insurance coverage needs to be increased if utilization of health care services for the whole population, particularly migrant population, is to be improved...|$|R

30|$|Seasonal {{migration}} from Poland to Germany {{has a long}} history, yet, {{there has been a}} lack of research which would discuss the perpetuating seasonal migration and its entanglements with the family relations.

30|$|I {{was able}} to meet and talk both {{formally}} and informally with migrating and non-migrating spouses, children of the migrants, {{some of whom were}} also circulating between Poland and Germany, friends and relatives of the <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrants.</b> Having met the pioneers of seasonal migration and other long term <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrants</b> in this local community helped me in understanding the actual impact of this migration on their personal life and on life of their families. As a result, this allowed me to deconstruct some common notions about the functioning of migratory households and migration networks. My own experience as a seasonal worker was coming in handy, as it helped to position myself not only as an interested, but not very well experienced PhD student, but also as a person who can personally relate to the joys and struggles of a seasonal workers. Contacts, discussions, and observation of relations within families with long experience of seasonal migration and enduring absence of some of its members contributed widely to my perception of a transnational family.|$|R

25|$|Fishes that {{spend time}} in {{estuaries}} (or river mouths) need to be euryhaline (tolerant {{to a range of}} salinities).

At times there may be only a few different fish species present in an estuary, but <b>seasonal</b> <b>migrants,</b> including eels, salmonids, and some forage fish such as herrings and sprats increase the diversity in the estuary.|$|R
