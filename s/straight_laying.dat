The first words that they uttered confirmed what I before knew. I did not feel shocked or overcome: I believe that I asked one or two questions and listened to the answers.

My mother had spoken with him, and what she said had touched him, for she had always been the best of mothers to him and he had been the great sorrow of her life. But I knew that this man Sparrow MacCoy had a great influence over Edward and my chance of keeping the lad <b>straight</b> <b>lay</b> in breaking the connection between them. I had a friend in the New York detective force, and through him I kept a watch upon MacCoy. When, within a fortnight of my brother's sailing, I heard that MacCoy had taken a berth in the Etruria, I was as certain as if he had {{told me that he was}} going over to England for the purpose of coaxing Edward back again into the ways that he had left. In an instant I had resolved to go also, and to pit my influence against MacCoy's. I knew it was a losing fight, but I thought, and my mother thought, that it was my duty. We passed the last night together in prayer for my success, and she gave me her own Testament that my father had given her on the day of their marriage in the Old Country, so that I might always wear it next my heart.|$|R

Contractors report that it creates <b>straighter</b> lines and <b>lays</b> flatter, making it more effective on irregular walls.|$|R
60|$|They {{had been}} ten days absent, {{and in that}} time great {{progress}} had been made with the galleys. They looked indeed completely finished as they stood high and lofty on the river bank. The planks were all in their places; the long rows of benches for the rowers were fastened in; the poop and forecastle were finished and decked. A number of long <b>straight</b> poles <b>lay</b> alongside ready to be fashioned into oars; and Edmund thought that in another two or three days the galleys would be ready for launching. They were long and low in the waist, and were evidently built for great speed. Edmund did not think that they were intended to sail, except perhaps occasionally when the wind was favourable, as an aid to the rowers. Each would carry a hundred and fifty men, and there were thirty seats, so that sixty would row at once.|$|R
40|$|Centrifugal {{acceleration}} of electrons by {{rotating magnetic field}} lines is considered and the maximum Lorentz factor, γ_max, for electrons is determined. It is shown that the main limiting mechanism for the γ_max is the inverse Compton scattering (ICS). Contrary to rm 00 {{it is found that}} when magnetic field lines are <b>straight</b> and <b>laying</b> in the normal plane to the rotation axis the breakdown of the-bead-on-the-wire approximation is negligible, becoming important only for a narrow class of active galactic nuclei (AGN). This result does not change when the magnetic field lines do not lay in the equatorial plane. It is shown that particles may be centrifugally accelerated up to γ_max≃ 10 ^ 8). We conclude that the energy of centrifugally accelerated particles can be amply sufficient for the generation (via the ICS) of the ultra-high energy (up to 20 TeV) gamma emission in TeV Blazars...|$|R

And straight ahead they went, following that mule track for some five or six miles until it began to slope gently towards the plain again.

40|$|Climbing perch, Anabas testudineus (Bloch) is a {{potential}} species for aquaculture in Kalimantan, Indonesia and belongs to Anabantidae family. The development of its digestive tract was evaluated on larvae reared under culture conditions of 28 oC- 30 oC, from hatching to 30 days after hatching using histological and morphological methods. The larvae were kept in six 100 -L tanks. They were fed with rotifers and microalgae from day 2 nd after hatching to day 10 th; Artemia nauplii from day 7 th to day  15 th; Artemia meta-nauplii from day 15 th to day 20 th; and Tubifex worm from day 20 th onwards. The development of digestive tract in climbing perch followed the general pattern described for other species. Shortly after hatching, its digestive system was found to be consisted of an undifferentiated <b>straight</b> tube <b>laying</b> dorsally to the yolk sac. At first feeding (day 2 nd), both mouth and anus had opened and the yolk sac was partially absorbed. On day 3, the digestive tract was fully differentiated into buccopharynx, esophagus, intestine and rectum. The two pyloric caeca appeared on day 25 th after hatching, indicating the transition from larval to juvenile stage and acquisition of an adult type of digestion...|$|R
60|$|By this {{glittering}} and imperfect brightness, {{about four}} bells {{in the first}} watch we made our third atoll, Raraka. The low line of the isle <b>lay</b> <b>straight</b> along the sky; so that I was at first reminded of a towpath, and we seemed to be mounting some engineered and navigable stream. Presently a red star appeared, about the height and brightness of a danger signal, and with that my simile was changed; we seemed rather to skirt the embankment of a railway, and the eye began to look instinctively for the telegraph-posts, and the ear to expect the coming of a train. Here and there, but rarely, faint tree-tops broke the level. And {{the sound of the}} surf accompanied us, now in a drowsy monotone, now with a menacing swing.|$|R

As she drew nearer, the air grew so hot that the red leaf shrivelled up, and Ripple would have died if she had not quickly {{unfolded}} the snowflake and wrapped herself in that cool cloak. Then she could safely pass under the tall arch into a strange place, where the walls were of orange, blue, and purple flames, that made beautiful figures as they flickered to and fro. Here the fire spirits lived, and Ripple saw with wonder their crowns of flame, their flashing eyes, the sparks that popped from their lips as they spoke, and how in each one's bosom burned a little flame that never wavered or went out.|$|R

40|$|Histological and histochemical {{methods were}} used to {{describe}} the development of the digestive tract in spotted sand bass larvae reared under culture conditions. The larvae were kept in six 100 -l tanks for 30 days. They were fed with Brachionus plicatilis from day 2 after hatching to day 13; Artemia nauplii from day 12 to day 17; Artemia juveniles and adults from day 14 to day 26; and a semi-dry artificial diet from day 20 onwards. Development of the digestive tract in spotted sand bass followed the general pattern described for other species. At hatching, it consisted of an undifferentiated <b>straight</b> tube <b>laying</b> over the yolk sac. At first feeding (day 2), the yolk sac was partially depleted and the mouth and anus were open. On day 5, the digestive tract was fully differentiated into buccopharynx, esophagus, stomach, anterior intestine, posterior intestine, and rectum. A few days after the onset of first feeding, a PAS-positive reaction was observed in both intestinal mucosae. The liver showed a constant glycogen accumulation after day 4. Formation of several supranuclear ninhydrin-Schiff (NS) positive vacuoles was observed in the enterocytes of the posterior intestine. Large supranuclear vacuoles were present in the enterocytes of the anterior intestine. The gastric glands and pyloric caeca appeared on day 16. Vacuoles of both intestines decreased in size and number with the appearance of gastric glands. A probable modification of the actual feeding schedule of spotted sand bass larvae is proposed...|$|R
60|$|Almayer got up {{and walked}} towards the {{balustrade}} of the verandah. He seemed not to be thinking of the officer's question. He looked at the body <b>laying</b> <b>straight</b> and rigid under its white cover on which the sun, declining amongst the clouds to the westward, threw a pale tinge of red. The lieutenant waited for the answer, taking quick pulls at his half-extinguished cigar. Behind them Ali moved noiselessly laying the table, ranging solemnly the ill-assorted and shabby crockery, the tin spoons, the forks with broken prongs, and the knives with saw-like blades and loose handles. He had almost forgotten how to prepare the table for white men. He felt aggrieved; Mem Nina would not help him. He stepped back to look at his work admiringly, feeling very proud. This must be right; and if the master afterwards is angry and swears, then so much the worse for Mem Nina. Why did she not help? He left the verandah to fetch the dinner.|$|R
50|$|The last lap {{started as}} a race between Silvio Fauner of Italy, Bjørn Dæhlie of Norway and Jari Isometsä of Finland. After a few {{kilometers}}, Dæhlie and Fauner were able create a gap to Isometsä, {{and the rest of}} the relay was a duel between the Norwegian and the Italian. For most of the race, Dæhlie was ahead. About two kilometers before the goal, both stopped, wanting the other to pull, and neither wanting to start the sprint. In the ascent towards the final <b>straight</b> stretch, Dæhli <b>lay</b> right in the back of Fauner. 180 m before the finish line, Dæhli switched tracks, but was not able to keep up with Fauner, who passed 0.4 seconds before Dæhlie.

Jacobsen finishes with a par on 18, tied for the lead with Roy and one shot ahead of Simms. Simms, for the 4th <b>straight</b> day, <b>lays</b> up at the 18th hole, playing it safe, although this takes him out of championship contention. Romeo urges that Roy does likewise to birdie and win the U.S. Open, but is urged by Molly to be himself and [...] "go for it". Roy, for the 4th day in a row, takes his shot and it reaches the green, but then [...] "a little gust from the gods" [...] - a sudden contrary wind - starts his ball rolling back, downhill into the water hazard.

Down to his last ball and risking not only humiliation but also disqualification, he still goes for the green, and on his 12th and final shot, the ball finally clears the water hazard, bounces on the green and amazingly rolls directly into the hole.

40|$|We {{developed}} {{a quick and}} reliable technique to distinguish live and immobile (presumed dead) Heterodera glycines second-stage juveniles (J 2) following their treatment with microbial culture filtrates. About 50 J 2 in 1 ml of culture filtrate or water were placed in wells of a 24 -well tissue-culture plate. After incubation, the nematodes in the wells were observed {{with the aid of}} an inverted microscope. The J 2 <b>lay</b> <b>straight</b> and their viability could not be determined by direct microscopic observation. With the addition of one or two drops (50 to 100 µl) of 1 N NaOH into the well, the live nematodes changed their body shape from straight to curled or hook-shaped after about 30 seconds. The nematodes that responded to NaOH by changing their body shape within 3 minutes were considered a live, while those nematodes that failed to respond within 3 minutes and were immobile were presumed to be dead.

5000|$|In 1988, the {{superintendent}} of the Indiana Reformatory, Edward L. Cohn, was reprimanded for shackling inmates in ways not allowed by current prison standards. Inmates were shackled in a position that allowed them neither to stand up nor <b>lay</b> <b>straight.</b> [...] This position is achieved by placing handcuffs around an inmates wrists and connecting them to leg irons with a short chain. One prisoner was kept in a maximum-restraint unit in this position for seven days, not even being allowed to loosen his shackles to eat or to use the bathroom. On another occasion, seven inmates wearing only underwear were placed in a single room. After two of the inmates were removed, the remaining five were put in restraints consistent with those mentioned in the previous incidents for one day. These {{were not the only}} cases of illegal restraints being used on prisoners. As a result of these incidents, Superintendent Cohn was placed on paid leave for approximately three months. Cohn lost “30 days worth of pay and a merit raise.” His two assistants were suspended for a number days without pay, denied their merit raises, and required to undergo performance evaluations quarterly instead of annually.
