40|$|Deafness is {{a complex}} {{disorder}} affecting 1 / 1000 infants. In developed countries, more than 50 % of deafness cases {{are thought to have}} a genetic cause. At least 40 loci for dominant non-syndromic deafness and another 30 for recessive non-syndromic deafness have been described. Mutations in the GJB 2 gene are the cause of an important number of cases of non-syndromic recessive deafness but are not as common in non-syndromic dominant deafness cases. We describe here a new dominant mutation (G 21 R) in the GJB 2 gene which causes deafness and has been identified in a three generation Cuban family with dominant non-syndromic congenital <b>sensorineural</b> profound <b>deafness...</b>|$|R
50|$|This gene encodes {{one of the}} two alpha {{chains of}} type XI collagen, a minor fibrillar collagen. It is located on {{chromosome}} 6 very close to but separate from the gene for retinoid X receptor beta. Type XI collagen is a heterotrimer but the third alpha chain is a post-translationally modified alpha 1 type II chain. Proteolytic processing of this type XI chain produces PARP, a proline/arginine-rich protein that is an amino terminal domain. Mutations in this gene are associated with type III Stickler syndrome, otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED syndrome), Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome, and autosomal dominant nonsyndromic <b>sensorineural</b> 13 <b>deafness.</b> Three transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified for this gene.|$|R

2500|$|Boxers {{with white}} {{markings}} covering {{more than one-third}} of their coat – conventionally called [...] "white" [...] Boxers – are neither albino nor rare; approximately 20–25% of all Boxers born are white. [...] Genetically, these dogs are either fawn or brindle, with excessive white markings overlying the base coat color. Like fair-skinned humans, white Boxers have a higher risk of sunburn and associated skin cancers than colored Boxers. The extreme piebald gene, which is responsible for white markings in Boxers, is linked to congenital <b>sensorineural</b> <b>deafness</b> in dogs. It is estimated that about 18% of white Boxers are deaf in one or both ears, though Boxer rescue organizations see about double that number.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in molecular genetics {{have allowed the}} determination of the genetic cause of some childhood non-syndromic deafness. In Portugal only a small proportion of families are referred to a clinical genetics service in order to clarify the etiology of the deafness and to provide genetic counseling. Consequently, there are no published studies of the prior beliefs of parents about the causes of hereditary deafness of their children and their genetic knowledge after receipt of genetic counseling. In order to evaluate the impact of genetic counseling, 44 parents of 24 children with the diagnosis of non-syndromic <b>sensorineural</b> prelingual <b>deafness</b> due to mutations in the GJB 2 (connexin 26), completed surveys before and after genetic counseling.

40|$|Introduction: Sudden <b>deafness</b> or sudden <b>sensorineural</b> {{hearing loss}} (SSNHL) {{is defined as}} sensorineural hearing loss of more than 30 dB at three {{consecutive}} frequencies within 3 days of onset, often unilateral and idiopathic. Etiology of sudden deafness is still not known, {{but there are many}} theories put forward by the experts as a risk factor for sudden deafness. The prevalence of sudden deafness 5 - 30 per 100, 000 people per year. Distribution of men and women almost equally, with the peak age of 50 - 60 years. Sudden deafness diagnosis is made based on history, physical examination and audiometry. Sudden deafness has three characteristics; acute, sensorineural hearing loss and unknown etiology. Additional characteristics may include vertigo, tinnitus and the absence of cranial nerve involvement. Management of sudden deafness include conservative therapy with multiple modalities. Case: Patient male, 40 years, Bali, Hindu present with hearing loss since ± 2 weeks ago. Patients previously complained of heat in the ear ± 2 days ago accompanied by a downward hearing and ears. A history of vomiting, coughs and colds denied. History of treatment at the hospital and was hospitalized for ± 2 weeks. Patients had never suffered from the same disease. No history of sinusitis, allergy, anemia, autoimmune and other systemic diseases. Patients also had never experienced trauma and underwent nasal surgery before.

40|$|Hearing {{is one of}} {{the main}} points of the {{communication}} process with the environment both humans and animals. The Auditory brainstem response (BAEP Brainstem Auditory-Evoked Potential) is a method that has been used in humans, dogs, cats, cattle and horses in order to identify possible hearing impairment that can’t be diagnosed during physical examination. The BAEP evaluates the integrity of the auditory pathway from the cochlea to the brainstem and allows the identification of animals with <b>sensorineural</b> and conductive <b>deafness.</b> Despite the importance of BAEP, no study to standardize its use in horses in Brazil was found. Thus, the objective of this study was to standardize the methodology for obtaining records to verify the wave latencies obtained in the examination for this species. 21 adult horses, males and females were used without previous history of hearing disorders. To perform the test, the animals were sedated with detomidine hydrochloride. Latencies of waves I, II, III, IV and V, as well as the intervals I-III, III-V and IV were identified. The mean latencies of the waves were, I wave 2. 4 ms; wave II 2. 74 ms; wave III 3. 61 ms; wave IV 4. 61 ms and wave V 5. 49 ms. The mean latencies of interpeaks were I-III 1. 37; III-V 1. 88 and I-V 3. 26. The description of the methodology used and the availability of records and latencies can serve as a reference for studies in this speciesA audição é um dos principais pontos do processo de comunicação com o meio ambiente tanto de seres humanos quanto de animais. O potencial evocado auditivo de tronco encefálico (BAEP-Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potential) é um método que tem sido utilizado em seres humanos, cães, gatos, bovinos e equinos com a finalidade de identificar possíveis alterações auditivas que não podem ser diagnosticadas durante o exame físico. O BAEP avalia a integridade das vias auditivas, desde a cóclea até o tronco encefálico e permite a identificação de animais com surdez neurossensorial e condutiva. Apesar da importância do BAEP, não foi encontrado nenhum estudo de padronização do seu uso em equinos no Brasil. Dessa maneira, o objetivo deste trabalho foi padronizar a metodologia para obtenção de registros que permitam verificar a latência das ondas obtidas no exame para essa espécie. Foram utilizados 21 equinos adultos, machos e fêmeas, sem histórico prévio de alterações auditivas. Para realização do teste, os animais foram sedados com cloridrato de detomidina. Foram identificadas as latências das ondas I, II, III, IV e V, bem como dos intervalos I-III, III-V e I-V. As médias das latências das ondas foram, onda I 2, 4 ms; onda II 2, 74 ms; onda III 3, 61 ms; onda IV 4, 61 ms e onda V 5, 49 ms.
