50|$|Both axles were rigid, {{featuring}} <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs.</b> The steering-axles {{were located}} at the extremes, decreasing the transmission of road shocks to the driver's hands.|$|R
50|$|The chassis was {{wood with}} metal {{reinforcing}} and <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs</b> were fitted to {{front and rear}} axles. Wire spoked wheels with 26 x 2.5 tyres were fitted.|$|R
50|$|Both axles were rigid, {{equipped}} with <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs.</b> The steering-axles {{were designed to}} minimise transmission of road shocks to the driver. The steering column was inclined backwards unlike the vertical shaft on many of its contemporaries.|$|R
50|$|Brakes were {{hydraulic}} {{and assisted}} by the Rolls-Royce mechanical servo with 11 in drums and suspension was independent coils {{at the front}} and <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs</b> at the rear. Twin brake master cylinders were incorporated from April 1956.|$|R
50|$|Rear {{suspension}} initially used quarter-elliptic rear springs, but buyers frequently squeezed four or {{five people}} into the nominally two-seater car, and in later models the chassis was extended at the rear to allow for more robust <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lockheed {{hydraulic}} brakes were fitted {{on all four}} wheels, the handbrake on the rear wheels using a mechanical linkage. Suspension was by long <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs</b> at front and rear with Armstrong hydraulic shock absorbers. Steering was by Bishop cam.|$|R
50|$|The {{tubular steel}} chassis was a short-wheelbase {{version of the}} 1800 saloon, {{featuring}} transverse leaf sprung independent suspension at the front and a live axle with <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs</b> at the rear. The rear track was wider than the front by some 4 inches. Brakes were hydraulic.|$|R
5000|$|Rear: Live axle, <b>semi-elliptic</b> leaf <b>springs,</b> {{hydraulic}} shocks ...|$|R
25|$|A minor {{evolution}} of the preceding One-O-Four, the Majestic, like all new Daimlers following 1937's New Fifteen, was designed around that same massive cruciform-braced box-section chassis equipped with André Girling's design of coil-sprung independent front suspension with a well-located hypoid bevel driven 'live' rear axle using <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Suspension: <b>Semi-elliptic</b> leaf <b>springs</b> {{front and}} rear. Hydraulic dampers.|$|R
5000|$|Rear: <b>Semi-elliptic</b> leaf <b>springs</b> {{with gas}} telescopc shock {{absorbers}} ...|$|R
50|$|The {{separate}} body {{was built on}} a ladder frame; front and rear there were solid axles on <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs</b> at the front and three-quarter elliptic springs at the rear. The brakes were on the transmission and on the rear wheels. The transmission was a 4-speed gearbox with a multi-plate wet clutch.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} was a 4-speed gearbox with a multi-plate wet clutch.The {{separate body}} {{was built on}} a conventional ladder frame; fore and aft there were solid axles, on <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs</b> at the front and three-quarter elliptic springs at the rear. Braking was by drums on the transmission and on the rear wheels.|$|R
50|$|Front : Non {{independent}} with <b>semi-elliptic</b> leaf <b>springs</b> and hydaulic dampers.|$|R

50|$|The Ten {{name was}} revived in 1932 {{for a small}} car {{available}} as a saloon, 4 seat coupé or 4 seat open tourer. The car was powered by a 1261 cc sidevalve engine with coil ignition. The suspension used <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs</b> front and rear and the brakes were mechanically operated. The number made is uncertain.|$|R
5000|$|Rear: Hotchkiss type with <b>semi-elliptic</b> leaf <b>springs,</b> shock {{absorbers}} and live axle ...|$|R
50|$|On 2.0-litre cars, {{the rear}} {{suspension}} {{consisted of a}} rigid axle on <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs</b> (single-leaf on the spider, two-leaf on the coupé) and twin hydraulic dampers on each side. It was located by a longitudinal reaction strut on each side, linked to the axle at the front and to the aft leaf spring attachment point at the rear.|$|R
50|$|There are two <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs</b> on each axle. The {{back axle}} is located {{by a pair}} of {{distance}} rods fixed to the main frame by the same brackets as the final drive and gearbox. Used to tension the chains they are free to swing about the same centre but place no strain on the countershaft's bearings.|$|R
50|$|The 1904 Berg was a {{touring car}} model. Equipped with a tonneau, it could seat 6 {{passengers}} and sold for US$3500. The vertical-mounted straight-4, {{situated at the}} front of the car, produced 24 hp (17.9 kW). A 4-speed sliding transmission was fitted. The armored wood-framed car used <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs</b> and was considered quite advanced for the time. The wheelbase was 90 inches long.|$|R
5000|$|The 320 {{was built}} on a {{shortened}} BMW 326 frame and used a 326 engine with a single carburettor and an output of [...] The suspension, which was carried over from the 329, consisted of an independent front suspension with a high-mounted transverse leaf spring acting as upper control arms and a conventional live axle on <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs</b> at the rear.|$|R
5000|$|Suspension {{consists}} of 4 <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs</b> on rubber bushes damped by Luvax hydraulic shock absorbers. Cars after 1931 replaced the rubber bushes with bronze bushes and grease nipples. Wheels {{were of the}} Magnum type with 5 studs fitted with 4.50×19-inch pneumatic tyres. The car had a track of 3 ft [...] in and a wheelbase of 7 ft 8 in.|$|R
50|$|The 1904 Eldredge Tonneau was a tonneau model. It could seat 5 {{passengers}} and sold for US$2000. The horizontal-mounted flat-4, {{situated at the}} front of the car, produced 16 hp (11.9 kW). The angle steel-framed car weighed 2300 lb (1043 kg). It was a modern touring car design with a cellular radiator (with fan), and <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs,</b> but sold for far less than competing models.|$|R
5000|$|It was a body-on-frame {{design and}} used the straight-4 [...] "B series" [...] engine from the MG Magnette saloon driving the rear wheels through a 4-speed gearbox. Suspension was {{independent}} with coil springs and wishbones at the front and a rigid axle with <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs</b> at the rear. Steering was by rack and pinion. The car was available with either wire-spoked or steel-disc road wheels.|$|R
5000|$|The 250 S used a 2250 mm {{wheelbase}} with a [...] "Tuboscocca" [...] tubular trellis frame. Suspension was by double wishbones at the front, {{with double}} longitudinal <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs</b> locating the live axle at the rear. The car had the drum brakes and worm-and-sector steering {{typical of the}} period. The dry-sump 3.0 L (...) engine used three Weber 36DCF carburettors and was mated directly to a five-speed manual transmission.|$|R
5000|$|The 541R {{employed}} a low-revving [...] straight-six engine from the Austin Sheerline. The suspension system {{came from the}} Austin A70 with independent suspension by coil springs at the front and a live axle with <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs</b> at the rear. The 541R, introduced in 1957, differed from the 541 by using rack & pinion steering instead of a cam-and-roller system, and large disc brakes were used on all four wheels.|$|R
50|$|The {{radiator}} {{was mounted}} vertically, {{directly behind the}} front wheels, and the <b>semi-elliptic</b> leaf <b>springs</b> were of substantial construction.|$|R
5000|$|The {{nomination}} document {{quotes a}} Vulcan {{ad in the}} 1947 Locomotive Cyclopedia, [...] ""All Vulcan diesel and gasoline geared locomotives are equipped with a distinctive four-speed, constant-mesh, spur-geared transmission which permits easy gear changes at relatively high speeds. Gears and shafts are heat-treated nickel-chromium steel mounted on anti-friction bearings and operating in an oil bath. Extra-heavy cross-equalized <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs</b> and Vulcan 3-point suspension assure easy riding on rough track and minimize derailments." ...|$|R
50|$|Particular care {{had been}} taken to ensure draught-free {{ventilation}} by scuttle ventilators and hinged rear quarter-lights. The windscreen was hinged at the top for clearer sheltered wet-weather unmisted vision after dark. The front windows were fitted with louvres and, when open, the windows provided an extractor effect at their rear edge. The steering was by Bishop cam. The rigid axle suspension for both front and rear was controlled by long <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs</b> aided by Armstrong hydraulic dampers.|$|R
50|$|All the Mark IVs {{were built}} on a {{separate}} chassis frame with suspension by <b>semi-elliptic</b> leaf <b>springs</b> on rigid axles front and rear.|$|R
50|$|The {{drum brakes}} {{operated}} {{on all four}} wheels. Suspension was traditional, involving rigid axles front and back with <b>semi-elliptic</b> leaf <b>springs</b> and “friction dampers”.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} was independent at {{the front}} using wishbones and torsion bars and at the rear had a live axle with <b>semi-elliptic</b> leaf <b>springs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Brakes were conventional, {{consisting}} of 17 in drum brakes finned for improved cooling {{and operated by}} rod. <b>Semi-elliptic</b> leaf <b>springs</b> were used at front and rear.|$|R
50|$|In 1925 the K4 and L4 {{models were}} {{introduced}} featuring a new {{engine of the}} same capacity, but lightened and simplified by conversion to side valves instead of overhead valves, use of aluminium pistons and lighter connecting rods. The side-valve engine may have been for streamlined production, cost, reliability or weight-saving reasons. The cantilever rear springs were replaced with <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs</b> and the rear axle was fitted with an underslung worm drive. The K4 used a 3 metre wheelbase and the L4 was approximately a foot longer.|$|R
50|$|The 1904 Four-Cylinder Premier was a {{touring car}} model. Equipped with a tonneau, it could seat six {{passengers}} and sold for US$ 5,000. The vertically mounted water-cooled straight-4, {{situated at the}} front of the car, produced 40 hp (30 kW). A three-speed sliding transmission was fitted as on Système Panhard cars from Europe. The pressed steel-framed car weighed 2250 lb (1021 kg) and used <b>semi-elliptic</b> <b>springs.</b> A Double-Cylinder Premier model sold for US$ 2,500. It had a 2-stroke straight-2 engine producing 20 hp (15 kW).|$|R
