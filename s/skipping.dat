40|$|In this paper, we empirically {{explore the}} effects of various kinds of <b>skip</b> {{connections}} in stacked bidirectional LSTMs for sequential tagging. We investigate three kinds of <b>skip</b> connections connecting to LSTM cells: (a) <b>skip</b> connections to the gates, (b) <b>skip</b> connections to the internal states and (c) <b>skip</b> connections to the cell outputs. We present comprehensive experiments showing that <b>skip</b> connections to cell outputs outperform the remaining two. Furthermore, we observe that using gated identity functions as <b>skip</b> mappings works pretty well. Based on this novel <b>skip</b> connections, we successfully train deep stacked bidirectional LSTM models and obtain state-of-the-art results on CCG supertagging and comparable results on POS tagging.

5000|$|PIC cores have <b>skip</b> instructions, {{which are}} used for {{conditional}} execution and branching. The <b>skip</b> instructions are [...] "skip if bit set" [...] and [...] "skip if bit not set". Because cores before PIC18 had only unconditional branch instructions, conditional jumps are implemented by a conditional <b>skip</b> (with the opposite condition) followed by an unconditional branch. <b>Skips</b> are also of utility for conditional execution of any immediate single following instruction. It is possible to <b>skip</b> <b>skip</b> instructions. For example, the instruction sequence [...] "skip if A; <b>skip</b> if B; C" [...] will execute C if A is true or if B is false.|$|R

Upon being classified, the system was immediately declared Tropical Cyclone Kate, <b>skipping</b> tropical low status. At the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began issuing advisories on the system, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 13P.

40|$|We {{present a}} new type of search trees, called <b>Skip</b> trees, which are a {{generalization}} of <b>Skip</b> lists. To be precise, there is a one-to-one mapping between the two data types which commutes with the sequential update algorithms. A <b>Skip</b> list is a data structure used to manage data bases which stores values in a sorted way and in which it is insured that the form of the <b>Skip</b> list is independent of the order of updates by using randomization techniques. <b>Skip</b> trees inherit all the properties of <b>Skip</b> lists, including the time bounds of sequential algorithms. The algorithmic improvement of the <b>Skip</b> tree type is that a concurrent algorithm on the fly approach can be designed. Among other advantages, this algorithm is more compressive than the one designed by Pugh for <b>Skip</b> lists and accepts a higher degree of concurrence because it is based on a set of local updates. From a practical point of view, although the <b>Skip</b> list should be in the main memory, <b>Skip</b> trees can be registered into a secondary [...] ...|$|R

Mietek Pemper testified at the trial that it was during the earlier period that Göth committed most of the random and brutal killings for which he became notorious. Concentration camps were more closely monitored by the SS than labour camps, so conditions improved slightly when the designation was changed.|$|E
