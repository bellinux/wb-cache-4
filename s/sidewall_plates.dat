50|$|A third {{method of}} {{thermoplastic}} welding is called sidewall fusion, or saddle fusion. Sidewall fusion is, like butt fusion and socket fusion, another process based on hot <b>plate</b> welding. <b>Sidewall</b> fusion differs from either socket, or butt fusion methods by performing fusion {{into the side}} of the pipe wall in a transverse orientation to the main pipe, rather than in line with the pipe. Sidewall fusion is typically employed in conjunction with either socket or butt fusion methods as a complementary process and many fusion machines designed for butt fusion are also equipped for <b>sidewall</b> fusion. Adaptor <b>plates</b> that match the outside diameter of the main pipe are applied to the heating plate to perform this type of fusion.|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional sidewall-compression {{scramjet}} inlets with leading-edge sweeps of 30 deg and 70 deg {{were tested}} in the Langley Hypersonic CF 4 Tunnel at Mach 6 and with a ratio of specific heats of 1. 2. The parametric effects of leading-edge sweep, cowl position, contraction ratio, and Reynolds number were investigated. The models were instrumented with 42 static pressure orifices that were distributed on the <b>sidewalls,</b> base <b>plate,</b> and cowl. Schlieren movies were made of each test for flow visualization {{of the effects of}} the internal flow spillage on the external flow field. To obtain an approximate characterization of the flow field, a modification to two-dimensional, inviscid, oblique shock theory was derived to accommodate the three-dimensional effects of leading-edge sweep. This theory qualitatively predicted the reflected shock structure (i. e., sidewall impingement locations) and the observed increase in spillage with increasing leading-edge sweep. The primary effect of moving the cowl forward was capturing the flow that would have otherwise spilled out ahead of the cowl. Increasing the contraction ratio increases the number of internal shock reflections and hence incrementally increases the sidewall pressure distribution. Significant Reynolds number effects were noted over a small range of Reynolds number...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we analyse {{the effect of}} EBG <b>sidewalls</b> in {{parallel}} <b>plate</b> slot antennas. Electromagnetic BandGap (EBG) structures present some interesting prope rties that may overcome {{some of the problems}} of conventional technologies. Recently, several EBG structures have been proposed and demonstrated to be useful in enhancing performances of microwave circuits or antennas. We use these novel structures to realize a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) surface artificially. The results of the effect using PMC in comparison with perfect electric conductor (PEC) in the sidewalls of the parallel plate slot antennas is presented as examples of application. Using PMC sidewalls in this kind of antennas, relatively uniform field distributions are improved, so it allows to increase the directivity getting to enhance the efficiency of these antennas...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} Casimir force between two {{parallel}} infinite metal cylinders, with nearby metal <b>plates</b> (<b>sidewalls),</b> using complementary methods for mutual confirmation. The attractive force between cylinders {{is shown to}} have a nonmonotonic dependence on the separation to the plates. This intrinsically multi-body phenomenon, which occurs with either one or two sidewalls (generalizing an earlier result for squares between two sidewalls), does not follow from any simple two-body force description. We can, however, explain the nonmonotonicity by considering the screening (enhancement) of the interactions by the fluctuating charges (currents) on the two cylinders, and their images on the nearby plate(s). Furthermore, we show that this effect also implies a nonmonotonic dependence of the cylinder-plate force on the cylinder-cylinder separation. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{evaluate}} the antibacterial activity of five different root-canal sealers (RoekoSeal, Ketac-Endo, AH Plus, Sealapex, Sultan). With the use of Enterococcus faecalis as a test organ-ism, both the agar-diffusion test (ADT) and direct-con-tact test (DCT) were performed. For DCT, sealers were mixed and placed on the <b>sidewall</b> of microtiter <b>plate</b> wells. A 10 -l bacterial suspension {{was placed on the}} tested material samples. Bacteria were allowed to di-rectly contact to the sealers for 1 h at 37 Â°C. Bacterial growth was then spectrophotometrically measured through every 30 min for 19 h by using an Anthos Labtec HT 2. For ADT, a 200 -l bacterial suspension was spread on brain-heart infusion agar plates. Freshly mixed sealers were poured into uniform wells punche...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted in the Lewis Research Center 8 - by 6 -foot supersonic wind tunnel to determine the vent discharge coefficient for the Centaur standard shroud/liquid hydrogen tank compartment vent. The test was conducted from Mach 0. 70 to 1. 96 with the vent mounted in a flat plate. Full scale simulated flight hardware, such as the vent, corrugations, aft field joint ring and ice bag clip was used. Air was discharged from a plenum chamber, located on the tunnel <b>sidewall</b> behind the <b>plate,</b> through five 6. 35 cm diameter vent orifices into the free stream. Boundary layer thickeners, analytically predicted displacement thickness for the vehicle nominal flight trajectory could be simulated over the Mach number range. The highest vent discharge coefficient for any given Mach number and vent pressure ratio generally occurred at the maximum displacement thickness...|$|R
40|$|Flows in a {{corrugated}} channel are {{investigated by}} a high-speed {{camera and a}} particle image velocimetry (PIV) system. The bottom wall of the rectangular channel was corrugated with periodic grooves while the top wall and two <b>sidewalls</b> were flat <b>plates</b> made of Plexiglas. Flow visualization data from the high-speed camera determine the critical Reynolds number to be around 1500 by examining {{the stability of the}} vortex in the groove as well as fluid ejection from the groove. The visualization data for turbulent flow also show how a vortex evolves within the groove and triggers another vortex formation in the subsequent groove, and how fluid ejected from the groove triggers another ejection from the subsequent groove. Thus, strong hydrodynamic interactions are observed between successive corrugations. In addition, PIV data provide the profiles of velocities and Reynolds stresses as a function of Reynolds number. Time-averaged streamlines show that a large, stable vortex exists in the groove for laminar flow. On the other hand, for turbulent flow, the vortex is unstable inside the groove, often prompting fluid ejection which interacts with the bulk flow. Especially the Reynolds stress of the square of velocity fluctuation in the direction normal to the bulk flow significantly increases as the fluid ejection from the groove intensifies with increasing Reynolds number...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBiogels made of {{crosslinked}} polymers such as proteins or polysaccharides {{behave as}} porous soft solids and store {{large amounts of}} solvent. These gels undergo spontaneous aging, called syneresis, which consists of the shrinkage of the gel matrix and the progressive expulsion of solvent. As a result, a biogel originally casted in a container often loses contact with the container sidewalls, and the detachment time is difficultto anticipate a priori, since it may occur over variable time spans (from hours to days). Here we report on syneresis phenomena in agar plates, which consist of Petri dishes filled with a gel mainly composed of agar. Direct observations and speckle pattern correlation analysis allow us to rationalize the delayed detachment of the gel from the sidewall of the Petri dish. The detachment time t* is surprisingly not controlled by themass loss as one would intuitively expect. Instead, t* is strongly correlated to the gel minimum thickness e min measured along the <b>sidewall</b> of the <b>plate,</b> and increases as a robust function of emin, independently of the prior mass-loss history. Time-resolved correlation spectroscopy atypically applied to such weakly diffusive media gives access to the local thinning rate of the gel. This technique also allows us to detect thegel micro-displacements that are triggered by water evaporation prior to the detachment, and even to anticipate the latter from a few hours. Our work provides observables to predict the detachment time of agar gels in dishes, and highlights the relevance of speckle pattern correlation analysis for the quantitative investigation of the syneresis dynamics in biopolymer gels...|$|R
