40|$|Background & aims: Non-coagulation {{of protein}} from enteral {{nutrition}} (EN) {{in the stomach}} is considered to improve gastric emptying and may result in reduced upper gastrointestinal complications such as reflux and aspiration pneumonia. For {{the development of a}} new EN protein mixture with reduced gastric coagulation, the coagulating properties of individual <b>proteins,</b> a novel <b>blend</b> of four <b>proteins</b> (P 4 <b>protein</b> <b>blend)</b> and commercial EN products were investigated. Methods: A semi-dynamic, computer controlled setup was developed to mimic gastric digestion. The coagulation behaviour of 150 ml protein solutions and EN products was investigated. These were heattreated calcium caseinate, sodium caseinate, whey, soy and pea protein, and the P 4 <b>protein</b> <b>blend</b> comprising of the latter four (all solutions 6 % w/v protein), four new enteral nutrition product varieties (New Nutrison 1. 0 or 1. 5 kcal/ml, with and without MultiFibre MF 6) based on the P 4 <b>protein</b> <b>blend</b> and two other commercially available casein dominant EN products (T 1 and T 2). Results: Calcium caseinate and sodium caseinate yielded a total wet coagulate of 43. 5 0. 7 g and 52. 7 6. 2 g, respectively. Whey, soy, pea and the P 4 <b>protein</b> <b>blend</b> did not produce any measurable coagulate. T 1 and T 2 resulted in a total wet coagulate of 37. 5 0. 8 g and 57. 3 0. 8 g, respectively, while all new EN product varieties based on the P 4 <b>protein</b> <b>blend</b> did not produce any measurable coagulate. Conclusions: The P 4 <b>protein</b> <b>blend</b> renders EN product varieties non-coagulating after in vitro gastric digestion...|$|R
40|$|The main {{drawbacks}} of protein-based bioplastics are a high {{sensitivity to}} water, insufficient mechanical properties, and a narrow window of processing conditions. The {{objective of this}} work was to study the effect of Kraft lignin (KL) on protein aggregation, functional, and rheological properties of fish protein (FP) -based bioplastic. FP powder was blended with 30 % glycerol and 0 - 70 % KL. Then, blends were thermoformed by compression molding. KL addition increased protein solubility in sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer, indicating a decrease of protein molecular weight. An introduction of KL in <b>protein</b> <b>blend</b> increased mechanical properties and decreased water absorption of materials. KL addition resulted in a decrease in storage modulus in rubbery state of <b>protein</b> <b>blends.</b> It also resulted in a decrease in viscosity of <b>protein</b> <b>blends</b> at processing temperature, as determined by capillary rheometry. Therefore, KL is an alternative additive to enlarge the protein thermal processing window and improve functional properties of FP-based materials. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{combined}} time domain NMR and rheology approach {{to quantify the}} water distribution in a phase separated <b>protein</b> <b>blend.</b> The approach forms {{the basis for a}} new tool to assess the microstructural properties of phase separated biopolymer blends, making it highly relevant for many food and non-food related applications. First, we determine the relaxation rate of absorbed water, and the viscoelastic properties of the separated phases as function of the water content. Next, the same properties are measured for the <b>protein</b> <b>blends.</b> Finally, predictions for water distribution obtained from rheological experiments are made via the polymer blending law, and compared to a more direct assessment of the water distribution with time-domain NMR relaxometry (TD-NMR). In this study, the <b>protein</b> <b>blend</b> consists of soy protein isolate (SPI) and vital wheat gluten (WG). We demonstrate that predictions for water distribution are similar for both TD-NMR and rheological measurements. It turns out that water does not distribute homogenously over the phases. Independent of the SPI and WG ratio, more water is absorbed by the SPI phase relative to the WG phase, which largely determines the resulting rheological properties of the blends. </p...|$|R

Pigs were blocked by weight with six replications per treatment and seven to eight pigs per pen. Dietary treatments were based on level of egg protein (3 or 6 %) added to a phase I high nutrient dense diet and the method of substitution (egg protein replacing either soybean meal or porcine plasma). A sixth treatment served as an initial test of an egg <b>protein</b> <b>blend.</b> Treatments were as follows: 1) Control, 2 and 3) 3 % or 6 % egg protein substituted for soybean meal, 4 and 5) 3 % or 6 % egg protein substituted for spray-dried porcine plasma, and 6) 4 % egg <b>protein</b> <b>blend</b> substituted for spray-dried porcine plasma. The control diet contained 7. 5 % porcine plasma, 1. 75 % spray-dried blood meal, and 20 % dried whey. The egg products were substituted for the soybean meal or the porcine plasma on an equal lysine basis, maintaining the lysine level of all diets at 1. 5 %. Total added fat was maintained at 5 % All pigs were fed a common diet from d 14 to 28 postweaning. During phase I, average daily gain (ADG) indicated that spray-dried egg protein was a suitable substitute for up to 3 % porcine plasma or up to 6 % soybean meal. However, pigs consuming the diet substituting 6 % egg protein for porcine plasma had poorer ADG. Feed efficiency became poorer as spray-dried egg protein was substituted for 6 % soybean meal or 3 to 6 % porcine plasma. This indicates that the fat in spray-dried egg protein may be less available than soybean oil. Pigs fed the diet containing the 4 % egg <b>protein</b> <b>blend</b> had poorer ADG and F/G than pigs fed the control diet. This indicates that 4 % egg <b>protein</b> <b>blend</b> cannot effectively replace porcine plasma.

Moisture sorption isotherms, water vapour permeability, sorption of aroma compounds, microstructure, water contact angle and surface properties were investigated. RESULTS: With increasing protein content, the microstructure changes became more homogeneous. The water vapour permeability increases with both the humidity gradient and the starch content. For all films, the hygroscopicity increases with starch content. Surface properties change according to the starch/whey protein ratio and are mainly related to the polar component of the surface tension.

Skeletal muscle {{growth and}} flesh quality of Senegalese sole fed diets containing increasing levels of plant <b>protein</b> <b>blends</b> to replace fishmeal were evaluated using muscle cellularity, texture profile and gene expression. A control fish meal-based diet (FM) was compared with three isonitrogenous (54 %) and isolipidic (9 %) diets with increasing levels of plant <b>protein</b> (PP) <b>blends</b> (50 % PP 50, 75 % PP 75 and 100 % PP 100). By {{the end of}} the experiment sole fed PP 50 and PP 75 had a final body length similar to the CTR (25 cm), but fish fed PP 100 were significantly smaller (23 cm). Total FM replacement by PP sources resulted in significantly smaller muscle cross sectional area (CSA) mainly due to a decrease in the muscle fibre size as the total number of fibres did not vary significantly among treatments. The dietary incorporation of PP significantly reduced the expression of several key genes involved in myogenesis and muscle growth (mrf 4, fgf 6, myhc and mylc 2). Fillet texture analysed instrumentally was affected by the total substitution of FM. Fish fed PP 100 diet had a significantly higher modulus of elasticity, i. e. lower flesh stiffness, compared with the other groups. Muscle fibre size was moderately related (r = − 0. 573) to the modulus of elasticity and positively correlated with the expression of lysyl oxidase (r = 0. 495). The observed changes in muscle cellularity could not be associated with the expression of texture-related genes (capn 2, ctsb, ctsd), since no significant differences were observed among diets.

By introducing a small amount of siloxane bond into the chitosan/soy protein system, the chitosan/soy protein hybrid membranes were improved in terms of structure, topography and mechanical properties.

40|$|ABSTRACT Grape juice {{contains}} high {{amounts of}} anthocyanins, with {{great potential for}} substituting synthetic food dyes. Carrier agents used in spray drying entraps anthocyanins, allowing their preservation. This work appraised whey protein/ maltodextrin (WM) and soy protein/maltodextrin (SM) blends as alternative carriers for spray drying of grape juice and encapsulation of anthocyanins. The effects of carrier agent concentration (CAC) and ratio protein/carrier agent (R) on grape juice powder properties were evaluated. The grape juice powders presented good solubility, low water content and high anthocyanin retention. WM blends resulted in higher yields and higher anthocyanin retention (from 77. 9 to 94 %) than SM blends, whereas SM blends leaded to higher encapsulation efficiency (> 97 %). Increasing CAC and R resulted in brighter powders, but reconstituted juices presented color parameters {{similar to those of}} fresh juice. WM and SM were suitable for encapsulating anthocyanins of grape juice, resulting in powders with potential applications in food industry. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The grape cultivar BRS violeta contains high levels of anthocyanins and is an alternative to produce antioxidant-rich and highly colored grape juice. Spray drying is applied for producing powdered grape juice with high anthocyanin content. In this technique, the addition of whey and soy <b>proteins</b> <b>blended</b> with maltodextrin as carrier agents avoid problems such as stickiness, which is negative to process yield and product quality.

40|$|Recently, we {{reported}} that growth of Atlantic salmon was reduced as dietary fishmeal (FM) was lowered from 25 % to 5 % in dual-substituted feeds {{compared to a}} control diet, formulated to represent the current upper levels of substitution of FM and fish oil. In the present study, the effects of different alternative <b>protein</b> <b>blends</b> and binders on growth of salmon fed dual-substituted feeds containing only 11 % FM, and with 60 % of dietary fish oil replaced by rapeseed oil were investigated. Salmon of initial weight 1. 3 kg were grown to market size (> 3 kg) {{over a period of}} 19 weeks. Salmon fed the diets with reduced FM showed lower final weight, SGR and TGC, associated with reduced feed intake. There was a tendency for increased FCR in fish fed the diets containing reduced FM although this was not significant, and there was no effect on PER. There were no significant effects on digestibility of protein or fat but the two parameters varied reciprocally and there were clear trends of increased protein and lower fat digestibilities in fish fed diets with reduced FM. Although lipid and fatty acid compositions did not vary greatly between diets there were significant effects on fish tissue compositions. Thus, liver lipid was generally reduced in fish fed diets with lower FM, significantly so in two of the four treatments. The proportions of monoenes were significantly lower and those of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) significantly higher in flesh and liver of fish fed diets with reduced levels of FM. The increased proportions of PUFA were due to increased percentages of 20 : 4 n- 6, 20 : 5 n- 3, 22 : 5 n- 3 and, although not consistently significant, 22 : 6 n- 3. The mechanisms for these unexpected effects of diet on tissue lipids and fatty acids are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Aquaculture as {{a global}} {{industry}} is at a crossroad; increased production cannot rely on the unsustainable harvest of forage fish for feed production. The use of fishmeal and fish oil as components in feeds for aquaculture, most notably for high value marine carnivores must be reduced or eliminated. The most promising and sustainable sources of replacement feed must be plant derived, such as soybean meal, wheat flour, and corn gluten along with dozens of other plant derived sources. Likewise for fish oil the most promising sources are plant oils such as soybean and canola oil supplemented with necessary omega- 3 fatty acids. 	This work was undertaken {{to examine the effects}} of switching marine carnivores from fishmeal-based feeds to fishmeal-free, plant-based diets. The majority of this research has been conducted with cobia, Rachycentron canadum, a promising species for intensive aquaculture due to its rapid growth rates, high disease resistance, and lack of a major commercial fishery as competition. A variety of plant <b>proteins,</b> plant <b>protein</b> <b>blends</b> and alternative lipid sources were examined for digestibility and efficacy as fishmeal replacement sources in regards to their effects on growth rates, feed conversion, and a range of physiological characteristics. 	This work has explored the hypothesis that marine carnivores have lost the ability to synthesize taurine, a non-protein amino acid, in sufficient quantities and must therefore be supplied through the diet, and should be considered essential for all marine carnivores. By measurement of gene expression of the genes in taurine biosynthesis, this work shows that cobia do not possess the ability to regulate taurine biosynthesis confirming taurine must be supplied through the diet. 	Overall, this work has developed multiple plant protein-based feeds that perform equivalently or better than commercial and commercial-like diets. Taurine has been shown to be an essential ingredient when seeking to reduce or preferably, eliminate fishmeal and thereby making aquaculture sustainable in providing protein to meet the world's growing population...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{evaluate}} efficiency of Labeo rohita to utilize fermented animal <b>protein</b> <b>blend</b> containing slaughter house blood (SHB) and fish offal (FO) as dietary fishmeal (FM) replacer. Five isoproteic (30 %), isolipidic (8 %) and isoenergitic (15. 00  kJ g− 1) feed were prepared by replacing 0 (T 1), 25 (T 2), 50 (T 3), 75 (T 4) and 100 % (T 5) FM protein with the fermented blend and fingerlings of L. rohita (mean weight 2. 07  g) were fed each of these feed in triplicate groups. The results showed that apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) of protein significantly increased in T 3 –T 5, while ADC of lipid and total amino acid absorption rate increased in T 2 –T 5 as compared to control (T 1). Among the essential amino acids (EAA), arginine exhibited maximum absorption followed by histidine, phenylalanine, valine and lysine while aspartic acid showed a high absorption among the non-essential amino acids (NAA). Fish fed up to 75 % of replacement level (T 4) did not show any significant difference (P <  0. 05) in weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR), protein efficiency ratio (PER) and apparent net protein utilization (ANPU) between the dietary groups (T 1 –T 4). But FCR was increased and other growth parameters were significantly reduced in 100 % replacement group (T 5), while body muscle protein was significantly reduced in both T 4 and T 5. Deposition of EAA (except histidine and methionine) in T 4 and NAA (except cystine) in both T 4 and T 5 in the muscle of fish were also significantly reduced as compared to control (T 1). Multi-objective optimization programming technique {{was used to determine}} FM replacement level that optimized all the growth parameters (WG, SGR, FCR and PER) simultaneously. By using Global Criterion method, it was obtained that 21. 11 % replacement of FM by the fermented blend was ideal for optimum growth of L. rohita...|$|R

Technologies to control Salmonella infection in poultry are important measures taken to reduce turkey and poultry production losses. A {{study was designed}} to determine extrusion conditions that optimized microbial inactivation in feed using the Extru-tech E 325 single-screw extruder. Bacillus stearothermophilus was selected as the indicator organism after no viable cells of Salmonella typhimurium were detected when 28. 5 % moisture content mash feed (wet basis) was extruded at 83 C extruder barrel exit temperature with a 7 second feed retention time in the extruder barrel. Spores of B. stearothermophilus inoculated into a standardized feed formulation consisting of 60 % corn meal, 30 % soybean meal,and 10 % animal <b>protein</b> <b>blend,</b> by mass, respectively, was used to investigate the effect of 3 extrusion variables on microbial inactivation. The 3 variables were extruder barrel exit temperature (T), mash feed moisture content (Mc), and mean retention time of feed in the extruder barrel (Rt). A rotatable central composite statistical design was used with 3 factors and five levels. The quadratic response surface model fit to acid producing, thermophilic organisms and artificially inoculated Bacillus stearothermophilus spore inactivation data was used to predict extrusion conditions that maximized inactivation. The response surface indicated a stationary point within the design region that was a saddle at T = 81 C, Mc = 27. 6 % wet basis (wb) and Rt = 8 s resulting in 0. 170 log cycles of acid producing, thermophilic organisms and B. stearothermophilus spore inactivation. An estimated ridge of maximum inactivation showed a maximum of 1. 03 log cycles at T = 110 C, Mc = 24. 5 % wb and Rt = 11 s. Because the least severe extrusion conditions (T = 83 C, Mc = 28. 5 % wb and Rt = 7 s) completely inactivated S. typhimurium in the standardized feed, it was speculated that all S. typhimurium cells would be inactivated at any set of extruder conditions within the central composite design region...|$|R

The formulations were studied for physico-chemical properties, antinutrient content (phytate and oxalate) and in vitro <b>protein</b> digestibility. <b>Blending</b> and sprouting significantly affected all the studied parameters. Sprouting significantly (p ≤  0. 05) improved protein content and in vitro protein digestibility, while carbohydrate content and antinutrients decreased significantly. Nutrition profile of water-based diets met RDA guidelines only after addition of sprouted green gram flour and were comparable to control (commercial weaning food). Water-based formulation showed lower sensory score than milk-based diets; however, addition of sprouted green gram flour significantly (p ≤  0. 05) improved their overall acceptability. It could be concluded that by incorporating sprouted green gram flour, milk could be replaced with water for production of hypoallergic weaning foods without affecting the nutritional and sensory attributes of formulations and thereby making the production more economical, especially for underdeveloped countries...|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Soy and whey proteins are two finest proteins due to their nutritional and health benefits. To reap these benefits it is essential to use them in products that are palatable and readily acceptable by consumers such as fibrous meat analogs. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the extrusion performance of soy, whey <b>protein</b> <b>blends</b> and to evaluate the effect of process variables on extruder responses, physical and chemical properties of resulted texturized product. A 4 [multiply] 3 [multiply] 3 factorial experimental design with two replications was used. It includes four feed compositions with WPI/SPI ratios (0 / 60, 10 / 50, 20 / 40, 30 / 30) (w/w), wheat gluten and wheat starch kept at 35 % and 5 %, respectively, three moisture levels (50, 55, and 60 %), and three cooking temperatures (165, 170 and 175 ⁰C). Whey protein isolates (WPI), moisture content, and their interactions had significant effect on extruder responses, hardness, chewiness and the lightness of the product (P [lesser than or equal to] 0. 05). Cooking temperature had significant effect (P [lesser than or equal to] 0. 05) only on extruder responses. WPI and moisture content had significant (P [lesser than or equal to] 0. 05) effect on protein solubility in all solvents except in PBS + 8 M Urea + 0. 1 % 2 -Me. Raising the percentage of WPI (0 - 30 %) and/or moisture from 50 - 60 % in the feed resulted in lower die pressure, softer texture, less fiber formation and lighter color. Degree and length of fiber formation was severely affected by raising the WPI (%) and it was not observed at 30 % level...|$|R
40|$|Prelipolized milk lipids are {{interesting}} flavouring ingredients and Mucor mieheienzymatic preparation is frequently used as lipolyzing agent. This study aimed atdetermining whether technological treatments {{such as high}} pressure homogenizationand heat treatment of milk emulsion might affect their susceptibility to lipolysis. Indeed,such treatments modify quantitatively (increase in lipid specific surface) but alsoqualitatively (protein interfacial composition and conformation) the emulsion interface. Ifit {{is well known that}} an increase in lipid specific surface induces an increase in thekinetics of lipolysis of the milk emulsion, the effect of qualitative variations of interfacialcomposition (load of amphiphiles such as casein micelles or whey proteins, state ofaggregation of these amphiphiles) on the kinetics of lipolysis remains to be elucidated. To reach this aim, 5 % (wt/wt) anhydrous milk fat oil-in-water model emulsions stabilized with 3. 5 % (wt/wt) milk proteins were elaborated. 3 types of milk <b>protein</b> <b>blends</b> were selected. They differed by their native phophocaseinate (PPCN) /whey protein (WPI) weight ratios: 0 : 100, 80 : 20, 100 : 0. The PPCN/WPI 80 : 20 wt/wt stabilized emulsions were subjected to a heat treatment (72 °C, 2 min) and compared with a similarlystandardized (5 % fat, 3. 5 % protein) milk emulsion. The model and milk emulsions all presented the same lipid specific surface and their granulometric stability was monitored. The emulsions were hydrolyzed by a Mucor miehei lipase preparation (30 °C,pH 7. 0) and the evolution of lipid hydrolysis was measured by pH-stat. Our results indicated that: i) the WPI stabilized emulsions presented a longer initial lag phase as compared to other model emulsions (PPCN, unheated PPCN/WPI 80 : 20 or heated PPCN/WPI 80 : 20) or milk emulsion; ii) after this initial lag phase, the rates of lipid hydrolysis did not differ greatly between PPCN and WPI-stabilized emulsions, but it did differ between heated emulsions as compared to unheated emulsions. This studyshowed that the level of denaturation of proteins at the interface of milk emulsions is a predominant parameter to control their lipolysis as compared {{to the nature of the}} protein present at the interface. And yet this parameter is a less effective lever than the quantity of interface available for lipase adsorption...|$|R
40|$|Adipic anhydride-plasticized {{soy protein}} (SP. A) was blended with poly(lactic acid) (PLA) at two {{concentrations}} (50 / 50 and 33 / 67) and was evaluated {{for use as}} a sustainable replacement for petroleum plastic in horticulture crop containers. Following the discovery that SP. A/PLA blends provide additional functions above that of petroleum plastic for this application, the present study evaluates the biodegradation behavior of these materials in soil and describes the substantial improvements in sustainability that result from the additional functions (intrinsic fertilizer and root improvement of plants) and the end-of-life option of biodegradation. After being buried in soil for designated time intervals, the residual degraded samples were analyzed to determine morphological and thermal properties at sequential stages of biodegradation. Samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results indicated that there was a compatible system between SP. A and PLA in the melt. Incorporation of SP. A accelerated the biodegradation rate of this binary blend significantly compared with pure PLA. Prior to the degradation process, both the glass transition temperatures and melting temperatures of the blends containing SP. A decreased as the concentration of the soy protein increased. With increasing degradation time of the blended samples in soil, the glass transition temperatures increased {{in the early stages of}} biodegradation then decreased, a trend associated with the decrease in the molecular weight of the blends as a result of biodegradation. In addition, the thermal stability of blends increased gradually with increasing degradation time, suggesting faster biodegradation loss of the soy component of the SP. A/PLA blends. These results support the use of soy-based polymer blends for horticulture crop containers and provide data for evaluating their use as sustainable materials for other potential applications. S.

Ruminal concentration of ammonia N, blood ammonia, and urea did not differ between treatments. Total concentration of volatile fatty acids was higher for bypass protein blend-fed cattle as well as percent molar concentration of propionate, butyrate, and valerate, while pH was lower. Total protozoa, and total and cellulolytic viable bacteria populations did not differ. Four of the cows received a dose of 5 ml of Prostaglandin F,a. Blood and cervical muc us samples obtained showed no difference in blood ammonia and urea concentration. Forty-six Holstein cows were assigned to one of the two treatments (top dressed on the t otal mixed ration), according to parity during the following 125 d postpartum. Daily dry matter intake and milk production were recorded. Feed, orts, and feces were sampled. Milk samples were collected weekly and analyzed for components. Percent lactose and solid non-fat showed higher for cattle fed the bypass prorein blend.
