5|$|Tronstad <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{year of a}} {{research}} period {{as an assistant to}} Herbert Freundlich in Dahlem, Berlin. He studied the passivity of metal surfaces, and made a breakthrough when he managed to measure extremely thin oxide surface coatings, thus solving a problem dating from the time of Michael Faraday. He continued to Stockholm to study metallography under Carl Benedicks, and to elaborate further on his results from Berlin. The work was completed in 1931 and his thesis, spanning 250 pages, was published in German as Optische Untersuchungen zur Frage der Passivität des Eisens und Stahls. For it, he received the doctorate degree. He was hired at the Norwegian Institute of Technology as a lecturer in the summer of 1931, although he <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> year at the University of Cambridge, conducting further research with a scholarship from a memorial fund of Christian Michelsen.

5|$|Admiral Graf Spee <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{three months}} of her career {{conducting}} extensive sea trials to ready the ship for service. The ship's first commander was Kapitän zur See (KzS) Conrad Patzig; he was replaced in 1937 by KzS Walter Warzecha. After joining the fleet, Admiral Graf Spee became the flagship of the German Navy. In the summer of 1936, following {{the outbreak of the}} Spanish Civil War, she deployed to the Atlantic to participate in non-intervention patrols off the Republican-held coast of Spain.

By September 1945, however, allied British and Dutch forces had begun to enter the archipelago, hoping to reestablish the status quo ante.

5|$|All of Pierce's cabinet {{nominations}} {{were confirmed}} unanimously and immediately by the Senate. Pierce <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{few weeks of}} his term sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as he sought to represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} thirty, Mahavira {{abandoned}} the comforts of royal life and left his home and family to live an ascetic life {{in the pursuit of}} spiritual awakening. He undertook severe austerities of fasting and bodily mortifications, meditated under the Ashoka tree, and discarded his clothes. There is a graphic description of his hardships and humiliation in the Acharanga Sutra.

5|$|Because he {{reported}} late, Berg <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{three months of}} the season on the bench. In August, a series of injuries to catchers Ray Schalk, Harry McCurdy and Buck Crouse left the White Sox in need of somebody to play the position. Schalk, the White Sox player/manager, selected Berg, who did a fine job filling in. Schalk arranged for former Philadelphia Phillies catcher Frank Bruggy to meet the team at their next game, against the New York Yankees. Bruggy was so fat that pitcher Ted Lyons refused to pitch to him. When Schalk asked him whom he wanted to catch, Lyons selected Berg.|$|E
