40|$|Among {{the systems}} {{in place in}} {{different}} countries {{for the protection of}} the population against the long-term contingencies of old-age (or retirement), disability and death (or survivorship), defined-benefit social security pension schemes, i. e. <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>pension</b> schemes, by far predominate, despite the recent trend towards defined-contribution arrangements in social security reforms. Actuarial valuations of these schemes, unlike other branches of insurance, continue to be carried out almost exclusively on traditional, deterministic lines. Stochastic applications in this area, which have been restricted mainly to occasional special studies, have relied on the simulation technique. This paper develops an analytical model for the stochastic actuarial valuation of a <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>pension</b> scheme. Formulae are developed for the expected values, variances and covariances of and among the benefit expenditure and salary bill projections and their discounted values, allowing for stochastic variation in three key input factors, i. e., mortality, new entrant intake, and interest (net of salary escalation). Each deterministic output of the valuation is thus supplemented with a confidence interval, that is, a range with an attached probability. The treatment covers the premiums under the different possible financial systems for these schemes, which differ from the funding methods of private pensions, as well as the testing of the level of the Fund ratio when the future contributions schedule is pre-determined. Although it is based on a relatively simplified approach and refers only to retirement pensions, with full adjustment in line with salary escalation, the paper brings out the stochastic features of pension scheme projections and illustrates a comprehensive stochastic valuation. It is hoped that the paper will stimulate interest in further research, both of a theoretical and a practical nature, and lead to progressively increasing recourse to stochastic methods in <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>pension</b> scheme valuation...|$|E

As a result, {{they often do}} not redistribute to the poorest, nor generally serve the role of facilitating economic change. Social sector reforms have therefore become necessary for reasons of social welfare {{as well as economic}} growth. The analysis of eleven transition countries—comprising some of the most advanced {{as well as some of}} the poorest transition economies—shows that almost all countries have started to undertake reforms; however, their individual efforts vary. Reform does not only stand for cutting back, but also requires in some cases a building up and in others a redesign of social safety nets; it needs to address insurance issues, budgetary transfer programs, the performance of the health and education sector, as well as the labor market regime and the approach to tax administration.

40|$|Although {{basic pension}} had failed {{for years to}} catch the {{imagination}} of policy makers in Greece, the severe crisis raging since November 2009 has caused it to be quickly put on the agenda. In May 2010 the government committed to a harsh austerity programme, aimed at fiscal consolidation, {{in return for a}} rescue package easing the sovereign debt crisis. The July 2010 pension reform, a key provision of the austerity programme, provided for the introduction of a near-universal basic pension starting in 2015. This paper explains why, paradoxically, the crisis made a universal basic pension in Greece more realistic. We argue, first, that <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>pensions</b> may be ripe for path-breaking reform if heavily subsidised in a non-transparent way, and, second, that any progress towards basic income is likely to be gradual, uneven and specific to the national policy context. ...|$|R
40|$|Social {{protection}} systems are delivered {{all over the}} world in a combination of pension schemes which could be a mixture of contributory and tax-financed, earnings related and flat rate, mandatory and voluntary, means-tested and universal, etc. In low-income countries, including Africa, the provision of social security is mainly through contributory pension schemes, being mandatory for the formal sector and voluntary for the informal sector. However because of their contributory nature, social insurance schemes are faced with coverage and compliance problems. In July 2001, Sierra Leone established a national <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>pension</b> scheme which replaced the non-contributory tax-financed government pension scheme that was in existence since independence. The new scheme became effective in January 2002 and currently provides retirement, invalidity and survivors ’ benefits to its members and their dependants. After five years of existence, this paper seeks to investigate the coverage and compliance situation in the National Social Security and Insurance Trust (NASSIT) scheme in Sierra Leone. The relevant indicators used in the investigation are the registration rate of legally covered persons, establishment/contributor compliance rate, effective coverage rate of insured persons, proportion of contribution in arrears and administrative cost ratio based on data derived mainl...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Ensuring {{adequate}} {{living standards}} {{to a growing}} number of elderly while restraining the growth of pension spending represents the main challenge for Italian pension policy. There is a need for an in-depth analysis of the economic conditions of the elderly which can help targeting resources in the coming years to the more needy groups. Using micro-data from the Bank of Italy Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW), we document that the incidence and intensity of poverty among pensioners in Italy are far below those concerning other citizens. This is mainly attributable to the generous rules which governed, until very recently, the public pension system. However, the economic conditions of pensioners vary a lot with age, gender, region and family characteristics. Some groups present high poverty risks. Moreover, the pension reforms implemented since 1992 will curb the benefits paid to younger generations, which also suffer from relatively low wages and increased job flexibility. As a result, for such cohorts the poverty risk after retirement has sharply risen. Changes in the <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>pension</b> schemes can mitigate some of these risks, but the goal of poverty reduction should be primarily pursued through other expenditure programs...|$|E

40|$|While {{financial}} {{globalization has}} created powerful incentives for Latin American governments to privatize old age pension systems, reliance on short-term capital flows has also constrained {{the ability of}} cash-strapped governments to enact that reform. Analysis of the technocratic process of pension reform in Argentina and Brazil pro-vides evidence. Instead of simply generating unidirectional pres-sures for structural pension reform, financial globalization has cre-ated a double bind for Latin America’s capital-scarce governments, fostering long-term incentives to privatize pension systems while heightening the risk of punishment in the short term. Since 1980, more than 25 governments {{around the world have}} imple-mented some form of market-oriented pension reform, or “privatiza-tion. ” More than a third of these reforms have been conducted in Latin America; 10 governments had implemented some form of pension pri-vatization by 2005. Although the specific design of pension privatiza-tions has varied considerably across the region, this trend is striking as much for its geographic and temporal clustering as it is for the deeply transformative implications of the privatization measure, which funda-mentally rewrites the basic social bargain of old age income protection in privatizing countries. Pension privatization, moreover, is costly to implement, both in financial and political terms. Not only must governments impose new risks and costs on beneficiaries of traditional <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>pension</b> systems while offering only long-term and uncertain benefits, but they also must continue to finance current benefits owed to retirees, even as workers divert payroll contributions to their private pension accounts. Pension privatization is therefore far from a quick fix for ailing state pension systems; instead, it is a costly and perilous measure for any gov-ernment, and particularly for the young democracies in Latin America. A rich body of scholarly research has emerged to address the puzzle of why and how so many Latin American governments have pri-vatized their national pension systems. For some scholars, the answer rests heavily on international financial pressures, which buffeted Latin American governments in the 1990 s. This view holds, first, that global economic forces, such as trade competition and capital mobility, gen...|$|E
