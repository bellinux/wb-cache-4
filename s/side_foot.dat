6000|$|... (Here {{follows a}} {{description}} of the THAMES AT MIDNIGHT, in a fine historical style; with an account of Lambeth, Westminster, the Savoy, Baynard's Castle, Arundel House, the Temple; of Old London Bridge, with its twenty arches, [...] "on which be houses builded, so that it seemeth rather a continuall street than a bridge;"--of Bankside, and the [...] "Globe" [...] and the [...] "Fortune" [...] Theatres; of the ferries across the river, and of the pirates who infest the same--namely, tinklermen, petermen, hebbermen, trawlermen; of the fleet of barges that lay at the Savoy steps; and of the long lines of slim wherries sleeping on the river banks and basking and shining in the moonbeams. A combat on the river is described, that takes place between the crews of a tinklerman's boat and the water-bailiffs. Shouting his war-cry, [...] "St. Mary Overy a la rescousse!" [...] the water-bailiff sprung at the throat of the tinklerman captain. The crews of both vessels, as if aware that the struggle of their chiefs would decide the contest, ceased hostilities, and awaited on their respective poops the issue of the death-shock. It was not long coming. [...] "Yield, dog!" [...] said the water-bailiff. The tinklerman could not answer--for his throat was grasped too tight in the iron clench of the city champion; but drawing his snickersnee, he plunged it seven times in the bailiff's chest: still the latter fell not. The death-rattle gurgled in the throat of his opponent; his arms fell heavily to his <b>side.</b> <b>Foot</b> to foot, each standing at the side of his boat, stood the brave men--THEY WERE BOTH DEAD! [...] "In the name of St. Clement Danes," [...] said the master, [...] "give way, my men!" [...] and, thrusting forward his halberd (seven feet long, richly decorated with velvet and brass nails, and having the city arms, argent, a cross gules, and in the first quarter a dagger displayed of the second), he thrust the tinklerman's boat away from his own; and at once the bodies of the captains plunged down, down, down, down in the unfathomable waters.|$|E

Most of the shooter's weight will be on the forward foot, with the forward knee slightly bent and the rear leg nearly straight. The shooter's upper torso should be leaning forward at the hips, aiming the shoulders towards the forward foot. The rear foot will help catch the force of recoil, as well as allow for rapid changes in position. The majority of the shooter's weight should be on the forward foot. Both of the shooter's knees should be slightly bent and the shooter should be bending forward at the waist as if preparing to be pushed backward.|$|E

5000|$|In 1952, the K series {{flatheads}} {{was introduced}} {{with the same}} bore and stroke, selling in parallel with the W series (which was discontinued after 1952), designed to compete with British sporting motorcycles of the time, as the American motorcycle Association allowed the 750 cc sidevalves a 50% displacement advantage to compete against 500 cc overhead valve bikes. The K models featured a unit construction engine and transmission case, right <b>side</b> <b>foot</b> shift and left <b>side</b> <b>foot</b> brake, and evolved from 45 cubic inches (1952 to 1953) to 54 cubic inches by a 0.75 in increase in stroke length (1954 to 1956) to 4-9/16" [...] over its five-year retail market run. The K series {{was replaced by the}} overhead valve Sportster series in the retail market in 1957. However, racing versions of the 750 cc K model (and some 900 cc KHR), designated KR, continued to be produced in very limited numbers for some time after, winning both roadraces and dirt track events against overhead valve bikes limited to 500 cc through 1969, when the American Motorcycle Association finally decided to change the rules by increasing the displacement to 750 cc, and removing the displacement advantage, making the venerable flatheads uncompetitive against 750 cc overheads. The K racers were replaced first by the iron-head XR 750 cc overhead valve engine in 1970, and two years later by the alloy-head XR, which continues in service in flat track racing to this day.|$|E

Another 1-2 victory in the FA Trophy, this time over Hednesford Town a loose ball in midfield was picked up by Bogle in plenty of space, which gave him time to curl a magnificent unstoppable shot over former Solihull keeper Dan Crane from 25 yards out.

50|$|Algeria, which {{needed at}} least a point to stay alive in the competition, scored three goals {{in the first half}} to take a {{comfortable}} lead. First, Islam Slimani sped past two South Korean defenders to receive Carl Medjani's long pass and slot home with his left foot past the advancing goalkeeper. Two minutes later, Rafik Halliche headed in Abdelmoumene Djabou's corner from the left. Djabou scored himself later after he received a pass from Slimani, shooting low with his left foot from twelve yards out.Early in the second half, Son Heung-min controlled a long pass from Ki Sung-yueng to shoot with his left foot between the goalkeeper's legs and reduce the deficit, but Yacine Brahimi restored Algeria's three-goal lead after a one-two with Sofiane Feghouli to <b>side</b> <b>foot</b> home from inside the penalty area with his right foot. Koo Ja-cheol scored South Korea's second goal after a pass from Lee Keun-ho from the left, but Algeria held on for its third ever World Cup victory, but its first since 24 June 1982.|$|E

50|$|The da Vinci System {{has been}} {{designed}} to improve upon conventional laparoscopy, in which the surgeon operates while standing, using hand-held, long-shafted instruments, which have no wrists. The da Vinci System consists of a surgeon’s console that is typically in the same room as the patient and a patient-side cart with four interactive robotic arms controlled from the console.Three of the arms are for tools that hold objects, act as a scalpel, scissors, bovie, or unipolar or bipolar electrocautery instruments. The fourth arm is for an endoscopic camera with two lenses that gives the surgeon full stereoscopic vision from the console. The surgeon sits at the console and looks through two eye holes at a 3-D image of the procedure, meanwhile maneuvering the arms with two hand controllers. Right <b>sided</b> <b>foot</b> controls operate the energy supplied to the instruments to cauterize, coagulate, or cut the tissue. Left <b>sided</b> <b>foot</b> controls help to move the endoscopic camera in or out and therefore bring the surgical image closer or further away. The da Vinci System scales, filters and translates the surgeon's hand movements into more precise micro-movements of the instruments, which operate through small incisions in the body.|$|R

Study of the external surface by scanning electron microscopy reveals that the <b>side</b> <b>foot</b> epithelium is characterized by a microvillus border with a very scant presence of small ciliary tufts, but the sole foot epithelium bears a dense field of long cilia. Ultrastructural examination by transmission electron microscopy of the side epithelial cells shows deeply pigmented cells with high electron-dense granular content which are not observed in the epithelial sole cells. Along the pedal epithelium, seven types of secretory cells are present; furthermore, two types of subepithelial glands are located just in the sole foot. The presence and composition of glycoconjugates in the secretory cells and subepithelial glands are analyzed by conventional and lectin histochemistry.

40|$|Soccer {{is played}} {{extensively}} throughout the world. As {{the popularity of}} soccer increases in America, a development of the teaching and coaching techniques is needed. Despite the increasing amount of soccer literature, the soccer throw-in skill has been understated. Up to date, only {{a few studies have}} assessed the throw-in biomechanically (Lueft, 1965; Kline, 1980; Levendusky, 1982 > and have provided some descriptive data concerning kinematics and kinetics. The throw-in is a unique throwing motion in that both hands must be used, the ball must come from behind the head forward, and both feet must maintain contact with the ground until release as stipulated by the laws of the game (FIFA, 1977). As a result, the coordination of the upper ody movements and the supporting lower body enable a player to throw for longer distances. There are generally two types of stances employed when performing the soccer throw-in. The staggered stance, used more commonly for longer throws, involves the thrower facing the field of play with one foot ahead of the other. The square stance involves a side by <b>side</b> <b>foot</b> position with both feet perpendicular to the field of play. There have been two investigations by Vennell (1967) and Wun (1969) which determined that the staggered stance with a short approach generated the maximum throwing distance or range. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate selected biomechanical parameters of the staggered stance throw-in. INSTRUMENTATION The present study employed both cinematographic and force analysis techniques to examine the biomechanical principles involved in the long throw-in...|$|E
