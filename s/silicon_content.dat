All films provided for characterization were deposited by reactive DC magnetron sputter deposition technique from elemental Zr and Si targets in a N 2 /Ar plasma at 800 oC. The hardness and microstructures of the as deposited films and post-annealed films up to 1100 oC are evaluated {{by means of}} nanoindentation, X-ray diffractometry and transmission electron microscopy. The Zr-Si-N films with 9. 4 at. % Si exhibit hardness as high as 34 GPa and a strong (002) texture within which vertically elongated ZrN crystallites are embedded in a Si 3 N 4 matrix. The hardness of these two dimensional nanocomposite films remains stable up to 1000 oC annealing temperatures which {{is in contrast to}} ZrN films where hardness degradation occurs already above 800 oC. The enhanced thermal stability is attributed to the presence of Si 3 N 4 grain boundaries which act as efficient barriers to hinder the oxygen diffusion.
