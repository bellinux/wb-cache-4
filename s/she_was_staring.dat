25|$|Thérèse {{was sitting}} in a low chair, {{to the right of the}} fireplace. Chin in hand, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> fixedly at the dancing flames, and did not turn her head when Laurent entered the room. Wearing a lace-edged {{petticoat}} and bed-jacket, she looked particularly pale in the bright firelight. Her jacket had slipped from one shoulder which showed pink through the locks of her black hair.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> at him, fascinated, {{and made}} a slight affirmative {{movement}} of the hand.|$|E
60|$|Fortunately {{she seemed}} to expect no answer to this query. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> at the wall with unseeing eyes.|$|E
50|$|There {{is always}} a charming smile in her face. It really feels like <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> at us if we kneel {{in front of her}} to pray.|$|R
6000|$|FANNY [leaning over a chair, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> {{into the}} eyes of the first Lady Bantock]. I wonder what she would have done if she had ever got herself into a really {{first-class}} muddle? ...|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of a young}} Hopi Indian {{girl with}} hair worn up in large buns {{at the side of}} her head, ca. 1900. Portrait from the chest up. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> of {{marriage}} age.

60|$|But the fan dropped: {{her arms}} lay limp in her lap; and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> {{up at me}} piteously, with a world of self-reproach in her {{beautiful}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> {{straight}} before her, {{her hands}} fallen to her lap, her face set as if carved and lifeless, {{and her voice}} came hard {{as the sound of}} one stone beating upon another.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me think. I--we were on no {{account to}} make any noise--on no account {{to make any}} noise." [...] <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> between Dandy's ears, with eyes that did not see, and a suffocating heart.|$|E
60|$|As {{the curtain}} rises, ANNA is {{discovered}} {{standing near the}} coil of rope on which the lantern <b>is</b> placed. <b>She</b> looks healthy, transformed, the natural color has come back to her face. She has on a black, oilskin coat, but wears no hat. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> out into the fog astern {{with an expression of}} awed wonder. The cabin door is pushed open and CHRIS appears. He is dressed in yellow oilskins--coat, pants, sou'wester--and wears high sea-boots.|$|R
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> Juan’s mother. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> wooed into {{marriage}} to Pedro by Sedano {{who said he}} thought of nothing but her all day and night and that her eyes were beautiful. Pedro owed her family the most money {{of all the other}} families, and her sisters had already moved to the city. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> married to annul the debt. Later, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> at a buzzard and wishes to be like it so that she could fly to her sister in the city. Pedro gets mad enough and dismisses her for good. They are never officially divorced. Her dying wish is for Juan to go and see his father and “make him pay for all those years he put us out of his mind".|$|R
5000|$|Emily first notices Sydney in [...] "Surfing the Aftershocks", {{staring at}} her by the {{staircase}} at Rosewood High and later again at the lockers. Thinking that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> because of Alison, Emily confronts her, only for Sydney to disclose that she admires her swimming talent and would love to hear Emily's opinions on her own abilities. At first, Emily is hesitant, but agrees to help Driscoll. Having watched Sydney swim, Emily and Driscoll head into the locker rooms, where Emily begins to measure Sydney's height to arm span ratio. Paige walks in and starts helping Emily, leading to an awkward conversation filled with suggestive innuendos.|$|R
60|$|For {{some time}} after she had heard the street door close behind him Honora {{remained}} where <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> <b>staring</b> into the fire, and then she crossed the room to a reading lamp, and turned it up.|$|E
60|$|The day wore on. In {{the middle}} of the afternoon, as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> out of the window, Anna Mower {{returned}} with more news. Dynamite had been discovered in Hawthorne Street, and it was rumoured that Antonelli and Jastro were to be arrested.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{came here}} to see you," [...] he said, [...] "--you." [...] <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> at him now, in horror. [...] "And if you don't give me what I want, I cal'late to see some one else--in there," [...] said Mr. Hopper.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{arriving}} at work, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> seen <b>staring</b> flirtatiously at her boss (played by actor Leon Ockenden), {{who is in}} his room.

6000|$|Even the rooming-house worm {{was making}} small {{worm-like}} sounds that presaged turning. Lee Theresa snapped just in time, [...] "Oh, cut it out, Ma, will you!" [...] <b>She</b> had <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> at the worm, {{for he had}} suddenly become interesting and adorable and, incidentally, an heir. [...] "I don't see why Mr. Wrenn ain't giving us all the notice we can expect. He said he mightn't be going for a long time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know of him. I {{know very}} little of poets. We {{restored}} very few works of art. Usually only the Church has been interested enough--" [...] He broke off. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring.</b> He flushed. [...] "Where I come from," [...] he finished.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just curious." [...] He studied her. She {{had taken}} off her coat, tossing it over {{the end of the}} cot. She was young, about twenty. Slim. Her long hair {{stretched}} out over the pillow. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> at him silently, her eyes dark and large.|$|E
60|$|Scarcely had he {{taken in}} this {{spectacle}} when Marlowe {{became aware of}} the girl he had met on the dock. She was standing a few feet away leaning out over the rail with wide eyes and parted lips. Like everybody else <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> into the water.|$|E
60|$|But Jenny Lascelles {{must have}} been in one of those {{abstracted}} moods which so troubled her husband, for <b>she</b> seemed to <b>be</b> <b>staring</b> straight before her into the recesses of the wood. In her there was a certain resemblance to the attitude of a listening animal.|$|R
40|$|Caroline Bonaparte Murat {{created an}} {{identity}} for herself through the art that she {{collected during the}} time of her reign as queen of Naples as directed by her brother, Napoleon, from 1808 - 1814. Through the art that she both commissioned and purchased, she developed an identity as powerful politically, nurturing, educated, fashionable, and Italianate. Through this patronage, Caroline became influential on stylish, female patronage in both Italy and France. Caroline purchased and commissioned works from artists such as Jean-August-Domonique Ingres, François Gérard, Elizabeth Vigée LeBrun, Antonio Canova and other lesser-known artists of the nineteenth century. Many of these works varied in style and content, but all helped in creating an ideal identity for Caroline. In all of the works <b>she</b> <b>is</b> portrayed as a powerful woman. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> either powerful by her settings (in the drawing room, or with Vesuvius in the background), her vast knowledge in the arts and fashion, her motherhood, her sensuality, or the way in which <b>she</b> <b>is</b> positioned and how <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> back at the viewer within the works. The creation of this identity was uniquely Caroline’s, mimicking Marie de Medici, Mari...|$|R
60|$|In {{the center}} of a group of expensive-looking people stood Mother, {{gorgeous}} in a gown like a herald's cloth-of-gold tabard. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> as magnificent as one of the larger chairs in a New York hotel lobby. Her hair <b>was</b> waved. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> coldly <b>staring</b> at Harris through a platinum lorgnon. Round her were the élite of Lipsittsville--the set that wore dinner coats and drove cars. A slim and pretty girl in saffron-colored silk bowed elaborately. A tall man with an imperial chuckled.|$|R
60|$|Dea Flavia {{had thrown}} {{herself on the}} couch on her back; her arms were folded behind her head, her fair hair lay in heavy masses on the {{embroidered}} coverlet. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> straight up at the ceiling, her blue eyes wide open, and a puzzled frown across her brow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, they're not so bad," [...] {{was all he}} answered. He {{pretended that}} his hand was the cat and hers the mouse. For {{the first time she}} tolerated him rather than {{encouraged}} him. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> out at Schoenstrom, a hamlet of perhaps a hundred and fifty inhabitants, at which the train was stopping.|$|E
60|$|So {{he saw a}} {{young woman}} {{approaching}} him. She was wearing a wide hat of grey straw, and a loose, swinging dress of nigger-grey velvet. She walked with slow inevitability. Albert faltered a little as he approached her. Then he saluted her, and his roguish, slightly withered skin flushed. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> straight into his face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Argument!" [...] exclaimed the lady. But she did {{not seem}} displeased. <b>She</b> had <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> very fixedly at Cynthia. [...] "My dear," [...] she {{continued}} kindly, [...] "you look like some one I used to know a long, long time ago, and I'll be glad to help you. Your uncle may be sensible enough in other matters, but I tell him frankly {{he is out of}} place here. Let him go away and sit down somewhere with the other gentleman, and we'll get the dress between us, if he'll tell us how much to pay." ...|$|R
50|$|One of the 'True Eleven', {{her power}} is glamour (specifically vanishing, like Barry). However, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{much better than}} Barry at being invisible, as <b>she</b> <b>is</b> less clumsy and can move about quietly. It <b>is</b> {{mentioned}} that <b>she</b> often appears by the elbows of other students and remarks on books which they <b>are</b> reading. <b>She</b> often gets Barry into trouble in lessons, but never gets into trouble as much herself, due {{to the ability to}} look innocent. In the last book, Gideon claims that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> attracted to Dax as <b>she</b> <b>is</b> seen <b>staring</b> at him and blushes whenever he comes nearby.|$|R
50|$|Austin and Julie {{have begun}} a relationship. Susan is {{concerned}} and gets Karl’s help to set limits for Austin and Julie but Karl {{is much more}} concerned with Susan’s relationship with Ian, and decides not to help. Austin and Julie both {{end up on the}} back of Austin’s motorcycle much to Susan’s dismay. Later, Susan <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> out the window when Julie asks her mother why, after sixteen years of good judgment on Julie's part, she can't trust her now with Austin. Susan tells her that relationships {{have nothing to do with}} good judgment and that anyone can still get hurt. After Susan leaves, Julie lifts the curtain where Susan had been standing to see that <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> wistfully at Edie and Mike kissing passionately.|$|R
6000|$|The {{symptoms}} returned; {{the native}} Christian was sent for, and found Mr. Chang's establishment full of buckets {{of water for}} extinguishing the sudden fires. Mrs. Chang's daughter-in-law was now possessed, and [...] "drank wine in large quantities, though ordinarily she would not touch it". <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> and tossing her arms wildly; a service was held, and she soon became her usual self.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am in {{love with}} your sister; but in love, Charlotte--in love!" [...] the young man pursued. Charlotte had laid her work in her lap; her hands were tightly folded on top of it; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> at the carpet. [...] "In short, I 'm in love, dear lady," [...] said Felix. [...] "Now I want you to help me." ...|$|E
6000|$|The room {{seemed to}} swim around him. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> at him, {{but he could}} see in her vacant eyes that she had no {{conception}} of his secret, nor knew the extent of her revelation. Duffy had not dared to tell all! He burst into a coarse laugh. [...] "What matters Duffy or the silly woman he'd try to steal away from other men." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Lucky Day" [...] was {{directed}} by Stephen Agnes; it was filmed in New York City, on the East Village. During {{the production of the}} music video, they were not allowed to play music on the streets and so Roberts had to wear an ear piece with the track playing, of which <b>she</b> stated people <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> at as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> jumping around on the set with no music playing so people did not understand what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing. Roberts expressed her discomfort with the shoot due to the weather saying; ...|$|R
50|$|The video {{begins with}} Jepsen spying on her {{attractive}} tattooed neighbour (Holden Nowell) {{as he is}} working on his lawn. As he takes his shirt off and notices <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> at him, Jepsen slips on her high heels and falls below her window. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> reading the books Love at First Sight (Men In Uniform) by B.J. Daniels and Skylar's Outlaw by Linda Warren. The scene then cuts to her garage, where <b>she</b> <b>is</b> rehearsing the track with her band. Following the rehearsals, her bandmates push her to go and wash her car, where she tries to gain her neighbour's attention with various provocative poses only to fall from the hood of the car. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> briefly knocked out from the fall, during which she dreams of a romance novel-type encounter with her crush against the backdrop of Peggys Cove. As she comes to, the neighbour then helps her to get up, and watches the band rehearse the track again. After turning and writing down her telephone number, Jepsen sees her neighbour pass one of her male bandmates (Tavish Crowe) his own number, indicating he doesn't like women at all and is gay, where the very end shows that Jepsen is shocked by this. The video received three nominations on the 2012 MuchMusic Video Awards in the categories of UR Fave Video, Pop Video of the Year, and Video of the Year.|$|R
50|$|Koenig and Carter {{manage to}} {{dispatch}} their guards and flee the cell with Helena and the fungus. Hiding in the forest, they prepare the fungus as per the doctor's instructions. By now, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> delirious, <b>staring</b> {{into the night}} sky and moaning about the Moon. After feeding her a dose of the makeshift concoction, they follow her gaze and see a moon flitting in and out of view through the clouds. Taking a long look, the men recognise familiar features and realise it is their Moon. Astonished, they conclude they have been on Earth all along...but in a time before 1999.|$|R
