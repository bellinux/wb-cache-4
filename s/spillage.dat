5|$|Although double-hull {{design is}} {{superior}} in low energy casualties and prevents <b>spillage</b> in small casualties, in high energy casualties where both hulls are breached, oil can spill through the double-hull {{and into the}} sea and spills from a double-hull tanker can be significantly higher than designs like the mid-deck tanker, the Coulombi egg tanker and even a pre-MARPOL tanker, as the last one has a lower oil column and reaches hydrostatic balance sooner.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} of labor for shooting the starship models was decided early on by effects cameramen Peter Daulton and Pat Sweeney. There was {{an equal amount of}} work if one crew did all the Enterprise shots and another did the Bird of Prey, Klingon cruiser and Excelsior shots, so the cameramen flipped to decide who worked on which models. Old and new techniques were applied to shooting the models. To make sure the vessels were seamlessly inserted into star fields in post-production, the crew filmed second passes in overexposed yellow light, which reduced light <b>spillage</b> onto the bluescreen backdrop. The yellow overcast was removed by filtration in the optical process, with the result being a clean edge around the ships.|$|E
5|$|There were a {{few major}} {{accidents}} {{in the history of}} the MRT that raised safety concerns among the public. On 5 August 1993, two trains collided at Clementi station because of an oil <b>spillage</b> on the track, which resulted in 132 injuries. During the construction of the Circle Line on 20 April 2004, a tunnel being constructed under Nicoll Highway collapsed and led to the deaths of four people. Disruptions to the system of late, the cause of which often being cited by a lack of maintenance coupled with increased ridership due to population growth, have also raised concerns among the public.|$|E

50|$|Other {{incidents}} traffic officers attend include; {{debris in}} the carriageway, <b>spillages,</b> animals, fires (to support the fire service), pedestrians, vulnerable persons, broken-down vehicles and network defects.|$|R
25|$|It {{should not}} become {{dangerous}} if liquid is spilled on it, {{and it should}} be easy to clean up such <b>spillages.</b> This is a major cause of injury.|$|R
5|$|Using a {{technique}} pioneered on Back to the Future Part II, another {{shot with a}} different lighting scheme was filmed. By combining separate key light and fill light passes, optical effects could generate any amount of contrast they wanted without causing <b>spillage.</b> Because Paramount continued to add new shots to the busy schedule and tight budget, some elements were flipped for reuse, including the star fields and {{a shot of the}} Bird of Prey firing. Whenever possible, the ships were filmed from below to reinforce the nautical theme, with their movements intended to remind the audience of galleons or other large seafaring vessels.|$|E
5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a {{rumbling}} or cracking noise was {{heard from the}} vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing Betelgeuse engulfed in a ball of fire a few moments later. A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil <b>spillage.</b> Local families living on the island fled for their lives.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 90-minute sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. However, all three sessions were disrupted and little running took place. During {{the first session}} on Friday morning, a <b>spillage</b> of diesel on track prevented the cars from going out on until very late in the session. Eventually, Nico Hülkenberg topped the session for Force India, ahead of his compatriots Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel. Since water was used to clear the surface, the first laps were run on intermediate tyres by most drivers, with both Williams cars being equipped with full wet tyres, but Valtteri Bottas spun on them entering the pit lane. Later, the track dried enough to use slick tyres, Fernando Alonso being the first to do so. Due to the limited running, the last minutes were busy with most cars out on track. Marcus Ericsson however was confined to the sidelines as he stopped with an engine problem. As Lewis Hamilton spun on his last timed lap, he needed to settle for seventh fastest.|$|E
5000|$|Typical {{contaminants}} {{found on}} contaminated brownfield land include hydrocarbon <b>spillages,</b> solvents, pesticides, heavy metals such as lead (e.g., paints), tributyl tins, and asbestos. [...] Old maps may assist in identifying areas to be tested.|$|R
50|$|Like any modern FRS, airport crews {{will deal}} with road traffic {{collisions}} on airport property, as well as chemical <b>spillages,</b> fires/rescues in airport buildings and special service calls on site if resourced with a form of domestic vehicle/facilities.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, most {{lubricant}} {{that ends}} up directly in the environment is due to general public discharging it onto the ground, into drains and directly into landfills as trash. Other direct contamination sources include runoff from roadways, accidental <b>spillages,</b> natural or man-made disasters and pipeline leakages.|$|R
5|$|To {{reduce the}} {{likelihood}} of damage to the A-10's fuel system, all four fuel tanks are located near the aircraft's center and are separated from the fuselage; projectiles would need to penetrate the aircraft's skin before reaching a tank's outer skin. Compromised fuel transfer lines self-seal; if damage exceeds a tank's self-sealing capabilities, check valves prevent fuel flowing into a compromised tank. Most fuel system components are inside the tanks so that fuel will not be lost due to component failure. The refueling system is also purged after use. Reticulated polyurethane foam lines both the inner and outer sides of the fuel tanks, retaining debris and restricting fuel <b>spillage</b> in the event of damage. The engines are shielded {{from the rest of the}} airframe by firewalls and fire extinguishing equipment. In the event of all four main tanks being lost, two self-sealing sump tanks contain fuel for 230miles (370km) of flight.|$|E
25|$|Though widespread, {{systematic}} contamination by {{hydraulic fracturing}} has been heavily disputed, one {{major source of}} contamination that has the most consensus among researchers of being the most problematic is site-specific accidental <b>spillage</b> of hydraulic fracturing fluid and produced water. So far, a significant majority of groundwater contamination events are derived from surface-level anthropogenic routes rather than the subsurface flow from underlying shale formations. Examples of such events include: a fracking fluid <b>spillage</b> in Acorn Fork Creek, Kentucky that caused a widespread death among aquatic species in 2007; a 420,000 gallon <b>spillage</b> of hyper-saline produced water that turned a once very-fertile farmland in New Mexico into a dead-zone in 2010; and a 42,000 gallon fracking fluid <b>spillage</b> in Arlington, Texas that necessitated an evacuation of over a 100 homes in 2015. While the damage can be obvious, and much more effort {{is being done to}} prevent these accidents from occurring so frequently, the lack of data from fracking oil spills continue to leave researchers in the dark. In many of these events, the data acquired from the leakage or <b>spillage</b> is often very vague, and thus would lead researchers to lacking conclusions.|$|E
25|$|Although {{sulfuric acid}} is non-flammable, contact with metals {{in the event}} of a <b>spillage</b> can lead to the liberation of {{hydrogen}} gas. The dispersal of acid aerosols and gaseous sulfur dioxide is an additional hazard of fires involving sulfuric acid.|$|E
50|$|A {{container}} {{can carry}} {{a wide variety of}} cargo during its working life. <b>Spillages</b> or contamination may have occurred on the inside surfaces and will have to be cleaned before habitation. Ideally all internal surfaces should be abrasive blasted to bare metal, and re-painted with a nontoxic paint system.|$|R
50|$|The {{company has}} been prosecuted {{a number of times}} for <b>spillages,</b> flouting {{planning}} rules and breaching environmental permit conditions. It has also been {{on the receiving end of}} criticism from local residents of Halifax and Bradford who have complained about the noise and smells emanating from the company’s factories.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, he lodged {{a further}} Private Member's Bill to {{restrict}} ship-to-ship oil transfers, {{with the aim}} of preventing <b>spillages</b> in the Firth of Forth. In response, the government introduced regulations to restrict such transfers in April 2010 [...] which were then delayed, but eventually were brought into force.|$|R
25|$|Supersonic speeds also {{threatened}} inlet stability; the inlet's central {{shock cone}} {{served as a}} compression surface, diverting air into the annular inlet. As the Lightning accelerated through Mach 1, the shock cone generated an oblique shock positioned forward of the intake lip; known as a subcritical inlet condition, this was stable but produced inefficient <b>spillage</b> drag. Around the Design Mach speed, the oblique shock was positioned {{just in front of}} the inlet lip and efficiently compressed the air without <b>spillage.</b> When travelling beyond the Design Mach, the oblique shock would become supercritical, and supersonic airflow would enter the inlet duct, which could only handle subsonic air. In this condition, the engine generated drastically less thrust and may result in surges or compressor stalls, these could cause flameouts or damage.|$|E
25|$|Further {{causes of}} {{groundwater}} pollution are chemical spills from commercial or industrial operations, chemical spills occurring during transport (e.g. <b>spillage</b> of diesel fuels), illegal waste dumping, infiltration from urban runoff or mining operations, road salts, de-icing chemicals from airports and even atmospheric contaminants since groundwater {{is part of}} the hydrologic cycle.|$|E
25|$|Fuel lines {{can also}} be {{attacked}} by another form of degradation: hydrolysis. Nylon 6,6 is susceptible to acid hydrolysis, and in one accident, a fractured fuel line led to a <b>spillage</b> of diesel into the road. If diesel fuel leaks onto the road, accidents to following cars {{can be caused by}} the slippery nature of the deposit, which is like black ice.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of decontamination procedures in general practice. DESIGN [...] Anonymous postal questionnaire survey of 600 general practitioners randomly selected from the national register. SETTING [...] General practices throughout the United Kingdom. SUBJECTS [...] 382 General practitioners, {{a response rate of}} 65 %. RESULTS [...] 186 General practitioners had autoclaves but 125 used hot water disinfectors or chemical disinfectants to reprocess instruments. 22 % (474 / 2132) Of high risk instruments were inadequately decontaminated. Decontamination was performed by the practice nurse or receptionist in 306 practices. Knowledge of treatment of <b>spillages</b> of blood fluids was uncertain, and only 114 general practitioners used effective methods for dealing with <b>spillages.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] A comprehensive central code of practice for control of infection is needed for primary health care staff...|$|R
50|$|Alternatively {{there are}} boot liners made from rubber {{which have a}} raised {{internal}} area and are tailored to fit the flat space within the boot. These are usually non-slip for the top surface and the internal area designed to prevent <b>spillages</b> or liquid leakages across {{the rest of the}} vehicle boot space.|$|R

They are usually part of the predetermined attendance to all incidents involving chemicals or asbestos.|$|R
25|$|These wet cells used liquid electrolytes, {{which were}} prone to leakage and <b>spillage</b> if not handled correctly. Many used glass jars {{to hold their}} components, which made them fragile and {{potentially}} dangerous. These characteristics made wet cells unsuitable for portable appliances. Near {{the end of the}} nineteenth century, the invention of dry cell batteries, which replaced the liquid electrolyte with a paste, made portable electrical devices practical.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, an {{investigation}} {{conducted by the}} BBC's Panorama concluded that the operation of more than 20,000 Combined Sewer Overflow pipes (CSO) was leading to the routine <b>spillage</b> of untreated wastes around Britain's coastline, potentially leading to very dirty water around {{some of the most}} popular beaches in the UK. The CSOs, intended for use in very rare occasions, were not covered by the existing legislation for waste emissions.|$|E
25|$|From 17 to 27 November, {{there was}} slight leakage from the tanker.

25|$|When larger ships such as {{cargo ships}} and tankers capsize or sink {{not only is}} {{recovery}} not possible but great environment damage can occur from <b>spillage</b> of cargo. Larger ships are being equipped with Surfacing System for Ship Recovery which is an inflatable device that is installed in the ballast water tank or within the hull of the vessel and can be deployed within seconds of an accident to stabilize the vessel and give more time for rescue and evacuation.|$|E
25|$|NIOSH found through {{results from}} focus groups that accommodation, functionality, accessibility, and {{visibility}} are four areas of high importance {{to be able}} to ensure safe discarding of sharps. The studies found it was important to have containers that are easy to use with little need for training {{to be able to}} use. The containers should be visible in any areas that sharps are used and be placed in such degree that <b>spillage</b> and injury will not be likely to occur with use.|$|E
25|$|The film flashes back to 21 {{years earlier}} during {{military}} era as Tamuno narrates their ordeal {{to the public}} via Kristy's camera. Ebiere (Mbong Amata) is born in Warri during the Military era; she concludes high school and is offered scholarship by Western Oil to study oversea. A few years later, an oil pipe in the Niger Delta bursts {{and the people of}} the community go to fetch petrol from the pipe, Dede (Hakeem Kae-Kazim), a fisherman discovers that fishes in the river have been killed by the oil <b>spillage.</b> The police arrive at the <b>spillage</b> site and demand that the Villagers vacate the area, but no one listens to them. Ebiere arrives in the village — her home, and is told her mother and siblings are getting fuel from a <b>spillage</b> site. On her way to the site, the site explodes killing her mother and siblings. The explosion appears to have been an accident, caused after one of the police officers sent to disperse the oil collectors lights a cigarette after having failed to do so. He is killed as well. Ebiere speaks up at a consolation visit of Western Oil staff (An oil rig American company based in Warri) and is applauded by members of the Community. This establishes her as one of the speakers for the Niger Delta Community, she is approached by Kate Summers (Sarah Wayne Callies), a reporter who likes her speech and says Ebiere is {{different from the rest of}} the community people, Kate becomes one of Ebiere's friends and supporters. Ebiere starts to organize peaceful protests and mass rallies for their voice to be heard, fighting for the Niger Delta to be cleaned up and well maintained — they are sometimes beaten, killed and/or arrested by the Military in the process. Ebiere is offered bribes severally by Western Oil representatives to stop her from instigating the people, but she always declines.|$|E
