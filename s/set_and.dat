5|$|Peano {{arithmetic}} is equiconsistent {{with several}} weak systems of set theory. One such system is ZFC with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation. Another such system consists of general set theory (extensionality, {{existence of the}} empty <b>set,</b> <b>and</b> the axiom of adjunction), augmented by an axiom schema stating that a property that holds for the empty <b>set</b> <b>and</b> holds of an adjunction whenever it holds of the adjunct must hold for all sets.|$|E

5|$|After Wimbledon, Murray {{returned}} to Queen's Club, {{to play for}} Great Britain against France in their Davis Cup quarterfinal tie. Great Britain went 1–0 down when James Ward lost to Gilles Simon in straight sets, however Murray levelled the tie with a victory against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Murray then teamed up with his brother Jamie to win the doubles rubber, coming back from a set down to defeat Tsonga and Nicolas Mahut in four sets, giving Britain a crucial 2–1 lead going into the final day. He then faced Simon in the fourth rubber and after initially being a <b>set</b> <b>and</b> a break down, he suddenly found his form again {{towards the end of}} the second <b>set</b> <b>and</b> eventually won in four sets, winning 12 of the last 15 games in the process (with Simon struggling from an ankle injury). With a 3–1 lead over France, this resulted in Great Britain reaching their first Davis Cup semi-final since 1981.|$|E
30|$|For {{the number}} of data classes to be classified, there are five datasetes in [21, 22], {{including}} normal eyes-open EEGs (Set A), normal eyes-closed EEGs (Set B), interictal EEGs at the opposite (<b>Set</b> C) <b>and</b> epileptogenic zones (<b>Set</b> D), <b>and</b> ictal EEGs (<b>Set</b> E) at epileptogenic zones. For two-class classification, studies described in [8, 12, 14, 23 – 25] classified <b>Set</b> A <b>and</b> <b>Set</b> E, <b>and</b> their accuracies ranged from 92 % to 100 %. Studies described in [26, 27] classified <b>Set</b> E <b>and</b> <b>Sets</b> A, B, C, and D, and their accuracies ranged from 96 % to 97 %. For three-class classification, studies described in [18, 28 – 30] classified Set A, Set D (Set C in [30]), <b>and</b> <b>Set</b> E, <b>and</b> the accuracies ranged from 85 % to 96 %. Finally, the studies described in [31 – 34] classified the five datasetes, and the accuracies ranged from 89 % to 99 %.

The crew fabricated a stand-in set for the God planet location, where additional scenes were filmed to combine with the location footage. Spock's catching of Kirk as the captain falls off El Capitan was filmed against a set that replicated the forest floor and was rotated ninety degrees.|$|E
5|$|At the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Murray lost at the quarterfinal {{stage to}} Juan Martín del Potro in three sets. At the Miami Masters, Murray {{made it through}} his first four matches without {{dropping}} a <b>set,</b> <b>and</b> after overcoming Richard Gasquet in the semifinals, faced David Ferrer in the final. After losing the first <b>set,</b> <b>and</b> facing match point in the decider at 5–6, Murray eventually took the match in a third set tiebreaker to win his second Miami Masters title, and leapfrog Roger Federer into {{second place in the}} rankings, ending a near-decade long time period in which neither Federer or Rafael Nadal were ranked in the top two. Murray briefly fell back to No. 3 in the world, following a third round defeat by Stanislas Wawrinka in Monte-Carlo, but reclaimed the No. 2 ranking as a result of Federer failing to defend his title at the Mutua Madrid Open. Later, Murray lost at the quarterfinal stage to Tomáš Berdych in straight sets.|$|E
