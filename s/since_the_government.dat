5|$|The Northwest Territories {{marked a}} new era when the {{legislative}} council moved into a newly constructed legislature building on November 17, 1993. The new legislature was the first building built specifically for the Northwest Territories government <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> sat in Regina 88 years earlier. The legislature building was constructed to feature themes derived from the Inuit culture, which signaled {{that the government was}} sensitive to the ethnicity of the resident population.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{expansion}} of the company's businesses, Octopus Holdings Limited was established in 2005 and Octopus Cards Limited was restructured as its subsidiary. The business of Octopus Cards Limited, being a payment business, is regulated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, while Octopus' non-payment businesses are not subjected to such regulation and are operated by other subsidiaries of Octopus Holdings Limited that are independent of Octopus Cards Limited. As of 2007, Octopus Holdings Limited was a joint-venture business owned by five transport companies in Hong Kong; 54.4% by the MTR Corporation, 22.1% by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, 12.4% by Kowloon Motor Bus, 5% by Citybus, and 3.1% by New World First Bus. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> of Hong Kong owns 76.54% of the MTR Corporation (as of 31 December 2005) and wholly owns the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, it is the biggest effective shareholder of Octopus Holdings Limited, and thus also the biggest effective shareholder of Octopus Cards Limited.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{suggested}} that Congress should charter the National Bank with a capitalization of $10million, one-fifth {{of which would}} be handled by the Government. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> did not have the money, it would borrow the money from the bank itself, and repay the loan in ten even annual installments. The rest was to be available to individual investors. The bank was to be governed by a twenty-five member board of directors that was to represent a large majority of the private shareholders, which Hamilton considered essential for his being under a private direction. Hamilton's bank model had many similarities to that of the Bank of England, except Hamilton wanted to exclude the Government from being involved in public debt, but provide a large, firm, and elastic money supply for the functioning of normal businesses and usual economic development, among other differences. For tax revenue to ignite the bank, it was the same as he had previously proposed; increases on imported spirits: rum, liquor, and whiskey.|$|E

5|$|On a {{fence in}} front of the wall, there were {{memorial}} crosses with the names and date of death on them. However, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> moved to Berlin, the white crosses had to be relocated in 1995 from {{the eastern side of the}} Reichstag. The new location is on the west side of the building at a fence of the Tiergarten. 2003, Wolfgang Thierse inaugurated a new memorial designed by Jan Wehberg with the same name as the one on Reichstagufer. On seven both-sided inscribed crosses are the names of the 13 deaths. Another memorial of the Civil Association was in Bernauer Straße. Other victims are remembered through commemorative plates embedded in sidewalks and other installations which are nearby their death spot. On October 2004, the Working Group 13 August built the Freedom Memorial at Checkpoint Charlie. It reminds people of the victims of the Berlin Wall and the inner German border with 1067 crosses. The memorial had to be removed after about half a year because the landowners terminated the lease with the working group.|$|E
5|$|Viceroy Cisneros {{tried to}} {{maintain}} the political status quo, but a group of criollo lawyers and military officials organized an open cabildo (a special meeting of notables of the city) on May22 to decide {{the future of the}} Viceroyalty. Delegates denied recognition to the Council of Regency in Spain and established a junta to govern in place of Cisneros, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> that had appointed him Viceroy no longer existed. To maintain a sense of continuity, Cisneros was initially appointed president of the Junta. However, this caused much popular unrest, so he resigned under pressure on May25. The newly formed government, the Primera Junta, included only representatives from Buenos Aires and invited other cities of the Viceroyalty to send delegates to join them. This resulted in the outbreak of war between the regions that accepted the outcome of the events at Buenos Aires and those that did not.|$|E
5|$|To {{make matters}} worse for Aberhart, Minister of Lands and Mines Charles Cathmer Ross {{resigned}} late in 1936, followed by Provincial Treasurer Charles Cockroft on January29, 1937. Neither minister's resignation was {{directly related to the}} dissidents' complaints: Ross resigned over disagreements with Aberhart on oil policy, while Cockroft left over a combination of ill health, clashes with Aberhart over the issue of a federal-provincial loan council, government investment policies, and Aberhart's approach to patronage. Nevertheless, the resignations were the public's first clue of dissent in Social Credit's ranks. Cockroft's resignation was followed by that of his deputy, J. F. Perceval, and there were rumours that Hugill and Minister of Agriculture and Trade and Industry William Chant would soon follow. This left Minister of Health Wallace Warren Cross, Minister of Public Works and Railways and Telephones William Fallow, and Provincial Secretary Ernest Manning as Aberhart's only indisputably loyal ministers, and Manning was away from the legislature, ill with tuberculosis. On February19, William Carlos Ives of the Supreme Court of Alberta dealt the government another blow when he struck down key provincial legislation, including one act reducing the interest paid on the province's bonds by half (though this was only a technical defeat, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> had been defaulting on its bond payments since the previous April).|$|E

50|$|The 1973 Act {{created a}} system of nine two-tier regions and three islands areas, and this system {{completely}} replaced local government counties and burghs in 1975.

25|$|Justice Souter {{noted that}} {{the ability of a}} U.S. citizen to get a trial may {{necessarily}} imply that the court has jurisdiction in that geographic area, since jurisdiction is largely a geographic and sovereignty matter. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> had said it would not challenge 'habeas corpus' by a U.S. citizen in Guantanamo Bay, in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld (2004), this could establish jurisdiction at the base.|$|E
25|$|Environmental impact. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> will rarely {{be able to}} {{fund the}} measure, many {{property}} owners, especially major developers, {{will be able to}} ignore environmental legislation enacted to protect the public good.

25|$|With such {{limits to}} foreign {{currency}}, a currency black market was created since Venezuelan merchants {{relied on the}} import of goods that require payments with reliable foreign currencies. As Venezuela printed more money for their social programs, the bolívar continued to devalue for Venezuelan citizens and merchants <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> held {{the majority of the}} more reliable currencies. Since merchants could only receive so much necessary foreign currency from the Venezuelan government, they had to resort to the black market, which in turn raises the merchant's prices on consumers. The high rates in the black market make it difficult for businesses to purchase necessary goods or earn profits <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> often forces these businesses to make price cuts, such as Venezuelan McDonald's franchises offering a Big Mac meal for $10.90 in January 2014, though only making $1 at the black market rate needed for imports. Since businesses made low profits, this led to shortages since they cannot afford to import or produce the goods that Venezuela is reliant on.|$|E

25|$|The {{export of}} trees felled by {{cyclones}} is permitted, opening a loophole <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> never inventories downed trees. Thus, the timber barons export logs {{that have been}} harvested previously, claiming they were a result of storm damage—a technique historically employed by loggers in the United States and elsewhere. The high density of rosewood prevents them from blowing over in cyclones, leading environmental activists to believe the only purpose is to facilitate illegal logging.|$|E
