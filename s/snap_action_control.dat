50|$|<b>Snap</b> <b>action</b> <b>control</b> {{systems are}} often run with electricity, where a {{stand-alone}} thermostat {{acting as a}} switch is activated by the capillary bulb fluid. The thermostat switches an electrical signal on-or-off to an associated solenoid valve, controlling gas flow to the burner. This construction allows integration of other control mechanisms into the system, such as pilot flame failure, but {{requires the use of}} components known to be sensitive to high temperatures and water damage. Solenoids and associated wiring are known to degrade over time, even if operating within their design parameters, due to the cumulative effects of thermal cycling and ambient grease and oil coating their surfaces - environmental aspects known to attack the integrity of plastics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Snap</b> <b>action</b> {{thermostats}} are {{the most}} common control used in heavy duty commercial griddles with medium-to-heavy production demands. These controls are called “snap action” because the control mechanism will turn the burner valve or electrical element fully on or completely off, with no modulation or intermediate heat source operation - effectively ‘snapping’ the heat source on or off. While not as responsive as solid state <b>controls,</b> <b>snap</b> <b>action</b> <b>controls</b> can maintain a griddle surface temperature within +/- 15°F (8°C) of set point if the thermostat bulb is embedded assuming a 1-inch (25mm) thick steel plate. This operating temperature range may be pushed to +/- 20 to 25°F (10°C to 13°C) if the probe is bottom mounted due to the additional thermal hysteresis introduced by the plate material.|$|R

40|$|A key {{aspect of}} daily {{functioning}} is {{our ability to}} control our response tendencies. An experimentally tractable way to study such control is by focusing on how initiated movements are stopped and changed (<b>action</b> <b>control).</b> Previous research has elucidated a network of structurally connected regions critical for <b>action</b> <b>control</b> including the right inferior frontal cortex (IFG), the pre -supplementary motor area (preSMA), and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of the basal ganglia. This thesis examines the functioning of this circuit in humans {{using a combination of}} electrocorticography (ECoG, providing both high spatial and temporal resolution) and electroencephalography (EEG) recorded at the scalp during stimulation of the STN.

40|$|Prevailing social {{cognition}} models consider behavioural intentions as immediate precursors of actions. This view {{ignores the}} role of more proximal self-regulatory processes, such as <b>action</b> <b>control.</b> The latter emerges after an intention has been formed and is supposed to maintain the level of intentions over time and to translate them into action.

40|$|Globally, {{fruit and}} {{vegetable}} intake is lower than recommended despite being an important component to a healthy diet. Adopting or maintaining a sufficient amount of {{fruit and vegetable}}s in one 2 ̆ 7 s diet may require not only motivation but also self-regulatory processes. <b>Action</b> <b>control</b> and <b>action</b> planning are two key volitional determinants that {{have been identified in}} the literature; however, it is not fully understood how these two factors operate between intention and behavior. Thus, the aim of the current study was to explore the roles of <b>action</b> <b>control</b> and <b>action</b> planning as mediators between intentions and dietary behavior. A longitudinal study with three points in time was conducted. Participants (N[*]=[*] 286) were undergraduate students and invited to participate in a health behavior survey.

The results revealed <b>action</b> <b>control</b> and <b>action</b> planning to sequentially mediate between intention and subsequent fruit and vegetable intake, controlling for baseline behavior. Both self-regulatory constructs, <b>action</b> <b>control</b> and <b>action</b> planning, make a difference when moving from motivation to action.

Results: The intervention {{had an effect on}} <b>action</b> <b>control,</b> as reflected by a time by treatment interaction.

40|$|The {{literature}} of <b>action</b> <b>control</b> claims that humans <b>control</b> their <b>actions</b> in two ways. In the stimulus-based approach, actions are triggered by external stimuli. In the ideomotor approach, actions are elicited endogenously {{and controlled by}} the intended goal. In the current study, our purpose was to investigate whether these two <b>action</b> <b>control</b> modes affect task-switching differently. We combined a classical task-switching paradigm with action-effect learning. Both experiments consisted of two experimental phases: an acquisition phase, in which associations between task, response and subsequent action effects were learned and a test phase, in which {{the effects of these}} associations were tested on task performance by presenting the former action effects as preceding effects, prior to the task (called practiced effects). Subjects either chose freely between tasks (ideomotor <b>action</b> <b>control</b> mode) or they were cued as to which task to perform (sensorimotor <b>action</b> <b>control</b> mode). We aimed to replicate the consistency effect (i. e., task is chosen according to the practiced task-effect association) and non-reversal advantage (i. e., better task performance when the practiced effect matches the previously learned task-effect association). Our results suggest that participants acquired stable action-effect associations independently of the learning mode. The consistency effect (Experiment 1) could be shown, independent of the learning mode, but only on the response-level. The non-reversal advantage (Experiment 2) was only evident in the error rates and only for participants who had practiced in the ideomotor <b>action</b> <b>control</b> mode...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Enhancing {{physical}} activity in overweight and obese individuals is an important means to promote health in this target population. The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA), which was the theoretical framework of this study, focuses on individual self-regulation variables for successful health behavior change. One key self-regulation variable of this model is <b>action</b> <b>control</b> with its three subfacets awareness of intentions, self-monitoring and regulatory effort. The social context of individuals, however, is usually neglected in common health behavior change theories. In order to integrate social influences into the HAPA, this randomized controlled trial investigated {{the effectiveness of a}} dyadic conceptualization of <b>action</b> <b>control</b> for promoting {{physical activity}}. METHODS/DESIGN: This protocol describes the design of a single-blind randomized controlled trial, which comprises four experimental groups: a dyadic <b>action</b> <b>control</b> group, an individual <b>action</b> <b>control</b> group and two control groups. Participants of this study are overweight or obese, heterosexual adult couples who intend to increase their physical activity. Blocking as means of a gender-balanced randomization is used to allocate couples to conditions and partners to either being the target person of the intervention or to the partner condition. The ecological momentary intervention takes place in the first 14 days after baseline assessment and is followed by another 14 days diary phase without intervention. Follow-ups are one month and six months later. Subsequent to the six-months follow-up another 14 days diary phase takes place. The main outcome measures are self-reported and accelerometer-assessed physical activity. Secondary outcome measures are Body Mass Index (BMI), aerobic fitness and habitual physical activity.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} examined {{the relationships among}} personality (as conceptualized by the Big Five Factors), leader-member exchange (LMX) quality, <b>action</b> <b>control,</b> organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB), and overall job performance (OJP). Two mediator variables were proposed and tested in this study: LMX and <b>Action</b> <b>Control.</b> Two-hundred and seven currently employed regular elementary school classroom teachers provided data during the 2000 – 2001 academic school year. Teachers provided personality, LMX quality (member or subordinate perspective), <b>action</b> <b>control,</b> job tenure, and demographic data. Nine school administrators (i. e., Principals, Assistant Principals) were the source for supervisor ratings of OCB, OJP, and LMX quality (leader or supervisor perspective). In eight of the nine total schools, teachers completed questionnaires during an after-school teacher gathering; in the remaining school location questionnaires were dropped off, distributed to teachers, and re-collected two weeks later. Results indicated {{a significant relationship between}} the OCB scale and overall supervisory ratings of OJP. The relationship among the big five factors of personality and OJP did not reach statistical significance, nor did the relationships among personality and OCB. The data indicated that none of the teacher tenure variables (i. e., teacher, school, or time worked with principal tenure) moderated the personality-OCB relationship nor the personality-OJP relationship. Finally, a review of the correlations among the variables of interest precluded conducting a mediation between personality-performance by OCB, mediation of personality-OCB by <b>action</b> <b>control,</b> and mediation of personality-OCB by LMX. In conclusion, the data reveal that personality was not significantly correlated with supervisory ratings of OJP or significantly related to supervisory ratings of overall OCB. Moreover, LMX quality and <b>action</b> <b>control</b> did not mediate the relationships between Personality-OJP nor the Personality-OCB relationship. Significant relationships were found between disengagement and overall LMX quality and between Initiative and overall LMX quality (both LMX-Teacher perspectives) as well as between personality variables and both Disengagement and Initiative <b>action</b> <b>control</b> variables.

Additionally, there was no clear evidence that individual differences in baseline <b>action</b> <b>control</b> (off dopamine medications) differentially responded to dopamine medications (i. e., no evidence for an inverted U-shaped performance curve).
