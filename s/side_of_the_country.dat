5|$|The {{construction}} of the railways in the mid-19th century made the Lake District, and Keswick in particular, more accessible to visitors of modest means. The original impetus for building the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway (CKP) line came from heavy industry: the new Bessemer process of steelmaking brought a great demand for the rich iron ore from west Cumberland and the coking coal from Durham on the east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> The CKP was built to enable ore and coal to be brought together at steel foundries in both counties. The line opened for goods traffic in 1864, and the following year it began to carry passengers. Fares varied, but holidaymakers could buy excursion tickets at discounted prices, such as six shillings for the 170-mile return journey from Preston to Keswick.|$|E
25|$|A further {{complication}} for Cook Strait's {{flow pattern}} {{is that the}} tide at the north side (e.g. at Nelson) follows the common bi-weekly spring–neap tide cycle (as found along the west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country),</b> but the south side's tidal pattern has only one cycle per month, as on the east side: Wellington, and Napier.|$|E
25|$|On {{the west}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G) had a route between Glasgow and Carlisle; however it was {{hampered}} by {{reliance on the}} Caledonian Railway route for the final approach to Carlisle, and primacy of the Caledonian Railway and its English ally, the LNWR, there. The G route was uncompetitive for traffic to and from Edinburgh.|$|E

Here, V CTRE coordinated the 'Po Task Force' and collected all available stocks of Bailey material to bridge this major river and the River Adige beyond, during V Corps rapid advance to Venice (entered on 29 April).|$|E
25|$|The {{availability}} of surface water varies markedly {{from east to}} west. The eastern Atlantic sloping side has water basins covering 15,000km2, many flowing rivers and abundant water resources overall. Thirteen major watersheds discharge into the Atlantic from this side accounting for 91% of the land area. By contrast, the Pacific slope on the western <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> has water basins covering only 4,000km2, rivers less than 20km in length and with lower flows. There are eight watersheds that account for 9% of the land area and drain to the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

25|$|The first combat {{operation}} the 133rd (Parachute) Field Ambulance {{was involved}} in was Operation Slapstick, a landing {{at the port of}} Taranto during the Allied invasion of Italy in September 1943. Slapstick was in part a deception operation, to divert German forces away from the main Allied landings at Salerno (Operation Avalanche), which would be taking place on the same day and also an attempt to seize intact the ports of Taranto and Brindisi. The main advantage of Tranato was its large port. Positioned on the eastern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> together with the expected capture of Naples in the west by the Americans, it would give the Allies two supply points, {{on opposite sides of the}} country.|$|E
25|$|Beginning with Selim I's {{acquisition}} of Medina and Mecca in 1517, the Ottomans, in the 16th century, added to their Empire the Hejaz and Asir regions along the Red Sea and the Al Hasa region on the Persian Gulf coast, these {{being the most}} populous parts {{of what was to}} become Saudi Arabia. They also laid claim to the interior, although this remained a rather nominal suzerainty. The degree of control over these lands varied over the next four centuries with the fluctuating strength or weakness of the Empire's central authority. In the Hejaz, the Sharifs of Mecca were largely left in control of their territory (although there would often be an Ottoman governor and garrison in Mecca). On the eastern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> the Ottomans lost control of the Al Hasa region to Arab tribes in the 17th century but regained it again in the 19th century. Throughout the period, the interior remained under the rule {{of a large number of}} petty tribal rulers in much the same way as it had in previous centuries.|$|E
25|$|The Hutu {{militants in}} the camps were very aware that the camps {{provided}} both protection and resources for their military activities. They thus {{had an interest in}} keeping the camps where they were, in effect making the refugees semi-hostages. Rumors of Tutsi retributions and an impending second genocide also convinced many Hutu refugees that they should not return. The obvious candidate to impose order was the Zairean government of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. However, Zaire was a large and weak state, which did not have firm control of the eastern regions that were on the opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> from the capital. It has also been noted that Uganda and Zaire had unfriendly relations. Mobutu would not have been pleased by the emergence of a Rwandan government that was allied with Uganda and may have hoped that the Hutu militants could rid him of the new government of Paul Kagame. Documents belonging to Hutu fighters show that Mobutu allowed the militants to ship large amounts of arms into the country. The only other option with international credibility was a multilateral intervention led by the UN, but it quickly became clear that few nations were interested in what seemed certain to be a difficult and bloody operation in a remote African region.|$|E

The city's newspaper, The West Australian, chose Stokes' picture to illustrate its story on the exhibition. Calling it Girl Drying Her Hair, the paper described the work as [...] "notable for its patient handling, use of bright colour and skilful blending of figure and background". The National Gallery of Victoria refers to the work as Woman Drying Her Hair, which it had acquired in 1947 {{at the behest of}} curator and artist Daryl Lindsay. It was soon to travel a great deal further than to Perth.|$|E

500|$|Along with deteriorating {{economic}} {{conditions in the}} 1870s {{and the start of}} a period known as the Long Depression, the dues charged by the Port of Liverpool and the railway charges from there to Manchester were perceived to be excessive by Manchester's business community; it was often cheaper to import goods from Hull, on the opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> than it was from Liverpool. A ship canal was proposed as a way to reduce carriage charges, avoid payment of dock and town dues at Liverpool, and by-pass the Liverpool to Manchester railways by giving Manchester direct access to the sea for its imports and its exports of manufactured goods. Historian Ian Harford suggested that the canal may also have been conceived as an [...] "imaginative response to [...] problems of depression and unemployment" [...] that Manchester was experiencing during the early 1880s. Its proponents argued that reduced transport costs would make local industry more competitive, and that the scheme would help create new jobs.|$|E

Bush made the decision to stop the offensive after a mere 100 hours. Critics labeled this decision premature, as hundreds of Iraqi forces were able to escape; Bush responded by saying that he wanted to minimize U.S. casualties. Opponents further charged that Bush should have continued the attack, pushing Hussein's army back to Baghdad, then removing him from power. Bush explained that he did not give the order to overthrow the Iraqi government because it would have [...] "incurred incalculable human and political costs.... We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq." ...|$|E
