5|$|Flocks {{of birds}} appear {{to engage in}} play; one routine {{involves}} a bird perching atop a tall tree, pole or spire, and others <b>swooping,</b> tumbling or diving and attempting to dislodge it. A successful challenger is then challenged in its turn by other birds in the flock.|$|E
5|$|Some large {{woodpeckers}} such as Dryocopus have a fast, direct form of flight, but {{the majority}} of species have a typical undulating flight pattern consisting of a series of rapid flaps followed by a <b>swooping</b> glide. Many birds in the Melanerpes genus have distinctive, rowing wing-strokes while the piculets engage in short bursts of rapid direct flight.|$|E

5|$|Arctic terns {{sometimes}} dip down to {{the surface}} of the water to catch prey close to the surface. They may also chase insects in the air when breeding. It is also thought that Arctic terns may, in spite of their small size, occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by <b>swooping</b> at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches. Several species are targeted—conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some auk and grebe species.|$|E
5|$|Some {{claim that}} <b>swooping</b> can be {{prevented}} by hand-feeding magpies. Magpies will become accustomed to being fed by humans, and although they are wild, {{will return to the}} same place looking for handouts. The idea is that humans thereby appear less of a threat to the nesting birds. Although this has not been studied systematically, there are reports of its success.|$|E

5|$|The Dutch stage show {{featured}} DeLange and Waylon using a specially-designed microphone {{stand to}} allow them to face each other, both playing guitars, while a bassist, a drummer and a cellist performed in the background. Low lighting was used throughout the performance, with large <b>swooping</b> camera shots {{at the beginning and end}} of the song implemented along with several close-ups during the rest of the performance. On the floor of the stage LED screens simulated road markings, while further screens on the background showed a rainy forest scene, transforming into a dry forest scene towards the end of the song's performance.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is in spring. During {{the beginning of}} the {{breeding season}}, courting pairs soar high together and one or both may make steep spiralling or <b>swooping</b> dives. The birds are monogamous and pair bonds may be maintained for more than one breeding season and the same nest sites may be reused each year. The nest is an untidy platform of twigs lined with rags and placed on a cliff ledge, building, or the fork of a large tree. Old nest platforms of eagles may also be taken over. Nests placed on the ground are rare but have been recorded in subspecies N. p. ginginianus and N. p. majorensis.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} {{a variety of}} calls; the two most common being the alarm call, made when {{possible}} predators (such as humans or other mammals) enter the colonies, and the advertising call. The advertising call is social in nature, made when returning to the colony and during aggressive encounters between individuals. It is unique to each individual tern and as such it serves a similar role to the bird song of passerines, identifying individuals. Eight other calls have been described, from begging calls made by females during mating to attack calls made while <b>swooping</b> at intruders.|$|E
50|$|The U.K. title shone the {{spotlight}} on the Predacons again when they attacked a circus, and the news report covering it revealed to <b>Swoop</b> that his old foe Divebomb was now on Earth.

Neither he nor <b>Swoop,</b> however, were particularly pleased when the other Predacons and Dinobots intruded on their private conflict, but when Grimlock almost killed Divebomb, <b>Swoop</b> stopped him and allowed the Predacons to go, so that when they next met, it would be on his terms.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Swoop!</b> is a comical satire on the then-popular {{genre of}} {{invasion}} literature. Six years before The <b>Swoop,</b> Wodehouse (under the pseudonym Henry William-Jones) contributed a humorous article to Punch magazine {{in which he}} outlined, in a mock-serious tone, the plot of an [...] "Inspired-Prophecy kind of novel, in which England is overrun by invaders until the last few chapters". [...] While it differs in many details from the earlier outline, The <b>Swoop</b> was that novel.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{potential}} prey-predator relationship, {{the presence of}} predaceous dingoes {{does not appear to}} heavily influence emu numbers, with other natural conditions just as likely to cause mortality. Wedge-tailed eagles are the only avian predator capable of attacking fully-grown emus, though are perhaps most likely to take small or young specimens. The eagles attack emus by <b>swooping</b> downwards rapidly and at high speed and aiming for the head and neck. In this case, the emu's jumping technique as employed against the dingo is not useful. The birds try to target the emu in open ground so that it cannot hide behind obstacles. Under such circumstances, the emu can only run in a chaotic manner and change directions frequently to try and evade its attacker. Other raptors, monitor lizards, introduced red foxes, feral and domestic dogs, and feral pigs occasionally feed on emu eggs or kill small chicks.|$|E
5|$|In the Book of Kells, the Chi Rho {{monogram}} {{has grown}} to consume the entire page. The letter chi dominates the page with one arm <b>swooping</b> across {{the majority of the}} page. The letter rho is snuggled underneath the arms of the chi. Both letters are divided into compartments which are lavishly decorated with knot work and other patterns. The background is likewise awash in a mass of swirling and knotted decoration. Within this mass of decoration are hidden animals and insects. Three angels arise from one of the cross arms of the chi. This miniature is the largest and most lavish extant Chi Rho monogram in any Insular Gospel Books and is the culmination of a tradition that started with the Book of Durrow.|$|E
5|$|The stage show {{featured}} Wurst in a cream-covered mermaid-like dress {{standing on}} a pedestal {{in the middle of}} the stage. The stage appeared dark at the beginning of the song with minimal lighting, before the lighting rose towards the beginning of the first chorus. At the start of the song, the camera appeared at the back of the arena before <b>swooping</b> into centre stage to a close-up of Wurst, followed by it flying off again at the beginning of the chorus. The background LED screens featured at the first chorus flaming rain, followed by flames in the shape of wings, in reference to the phoenix in the title of the song. Pyrotechnic flames also featured at the finale of the song. Wind machines were also used to effect during the performance.|$|E

5|$|The average {{lifespan}} of {{bald eagles}} {{in the wild}} is around 20 years, with the oldest confirmed one having been 38 years of age. In captivity, they often live somewhat longer. In one instance, a captive individual in New York lived for nearly 50 years. As with size, the average lifespan of an eagle population appears {{to be influenced by}} its location and access to prey. As they are no longer heavily persecuted, adult mortality is quite low. In one study of Florida eagles, adult bald eagles reportedly had 100% annual survival rate. In Prince William Sound in Alaska, adults had an annual survival rate of 88% even after the Exxon Valdez oil spill adversely affected eagles in the area. Of 1,428 individuals from across the range necropsied by National Wildlife Health Center from 1963 to 1984, 329 (23%) eagles died from trauma, primarily impact with wires and vehicles; 309 (22%) died from gunshot; 158 (11%) died from poisoning; 130 (9%) died from electrocution; 68 (5%) died from trapping; 110 (8%) from emaciation; and 31 (2%) from disease; cause of death was undetermined in 293 (20%) of cases. In this study, 68% of mortality was human-caused. Today eagle-shooting is believed to be considerably reduced due to the species protected status. In one case, an adult eagle investigating a peregrine falcon nest for prey items sustained a concussion from a <b>swooping</b> parent peregrine, and ultimately died days later from it. An early natural history video depicting a cougar (Puma concolor) ambushing and killing an immature bald eagle feeding at a rabbit carcass is viewable online although this film may have been staged.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a software package (named <b>Swoop)</b> is described. <b>Swoop</b> is designed to support the generation and maintenance of WWW information systems which store information in ORACLE databases: a so-called hyperbase program. The biggest problem with hyperbases is that they require a sophisticated program to interpret Forms, query appropriate databases, and merge information into Hypertext. There is a clear need for application-generator tools which allow hyperbase programs to be constructed with minimal expertise {{on the part of}} the designer. It is this problem which <b>Swoop</b> addresses...|$|R

25|$|Injuries and {{fatalities}} occurring under a fully functional parachute usually {{happen because}} the skydiver performed unsafe maneuvers or made {{an error in}} judgment while flying their canopy, typically resulting in a high-speed impact with the ground or other hazards on the ground. One {{of the most common}} sources of injury is a low turn under a high-performance canopy and while <b>swooping.</b> <b>Swooping</b> is the advanced discipline of gliding at high-speed parallel to the ground during landing.|$|E
25|$|Mobbing calls {{may also}} {{be part of an}} animal's arsenal in harassing the predator. Studies of Phainopepla mobbing calls {{indicate}} it may serve to enhance the <b>swooping</b> attack on the predators, including scrub jays. In this species, the mobbing call is smoothly upsweeping, and is made when <b>swooping</b> down in an arc beside the predator. This call was also heard during agonistic behavior interactions with conspecifics, and may serve additionally or alternatively as an alarm call to their mate.|$|E
