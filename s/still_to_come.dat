However, on Nihtilä’s request, Oesch returned already on 30 August 1941, because Oesch’s deputy, Major General Taavetti Laatikainen, had neglected his new duties.

25|$|In the 1972 season, Davourlis scored 15 {{goals and}} Panachaiki {{finished}} sixth. The best was <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> though. After an amazing 1973 {{season in which}} he scored again 15 goals, including a hat trick in Toumba Stadium against championship contender PAOK, he achieved with Panachaiki something that no other Greek countryside club ever had done at the time: participation in a European competition, for instance the 1974 UEFA Cup. In 1974, Davourlis' performances and leadership were still very good but rumors related to his transfer affected him considerably. Panachaiki proved to be unable to become a real threat to the local powerhouses and finished once again sixth. At {{the end of a}} season during which he scored 11 times in the Championship and once in the UEFA Cup, Davourlis was transferred to Olympiacos. The transfer fee was 9.25 million Drachmas, the highest in Greek football history at the time.|$|E
25|$|On that stage, Adam Hansen– a rider who had {{completed}} all three Grand Tours in 2012– took the honours by over a minute from a stage-long breakaway, while Beñat Intxausti {{was able to}} take the leader's jersey after finishing in the group of the overall favourites for the race. Intxausti's weakness in the time trial discipline saw him surrender the lead the following day, losing three-and-a-half minutes to the stage winner, team-mate Alex Dowsett. Vincenzo Nibali– a previous Grand Tour winner at the 2010 Vuelta a España– assumed the race lead, and held the lead {{to the end of the}} eleventh stage, which marked the halfway point of the race. Nibali had ended the time trial 29 seconds clear of closest challenger Cadel Evans, but he gained twelve bonus seconds on the tenth stage, the race's first summit finish, to extend his advantage to 41 seconds with the more mountainous second half of the Giro <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E

25|$|The first attacks {{began at}} 03:00 on 22 June. The Soviets {{had been caught}} by surprise, their {{aircraft}} bunched together in neat rows which were vulnerable. The results were devastating. At Pinsk aerodrome 39 SBAP of 10 SAD lost 43 SBs and five Pe-2s on the ground after attacks by KG 3, which lost one bomber. Further to the west, 33 IAP/10 SAD lost 46 I-53 and I-16s to fighter-bombers of JG 51. Messerschmitt Bf 110s of SKG 210 destroyed 50 aircraft at Korbin airfield, near the headquarters of 10 SAD and the Soviet Fourth Army. The airfield based the 74 ShAP, which lost 47 I-15s, 5 I-153s and 8 IL-2 aircraft on 22 June. Worse was <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Slightly later, KG 54 attacked airfields in the area, and its 80 Ju 88s destroyed 100 Soviet aircraft. However, the Luftwaffe and its allies were far from alone in the skies. The VVS flew 6,000 sorties {{in comparison to the}} German 2,272 sorties and VVS ZOVO put 1,900 aircraft into the air. They put up bitter resistance in the air scoring a few successes.|$|E
25|$|Requiring {{the task}} force commander's {{permission}} to send out the relief force and to accompany it, Townsend telephoned Jackson. Concerned {{for the safety of}} the entire force, Jackson was initially reluctant to authorise its dispatch should it weaken the position at Nui Dat. Although he was unsure of the size of the Viet Cong facing D Company, from Smith's reports it appeared to be at least a regular battalion. Intelligence suggested it was likely from the 275th Regiment, although the location of its remaining two battalions were unknown, as was that of D445 Battalion. The whereabouts of the 274th Regiment was equally unclear. While radio direction finding suggested it may have been near Phuoc Tuy's northern border, three weeks earlier it had been reported close to the western side of the Australian TAOR, and one of its battalions had (incorrectly) been believed involved in an attack on Phu My in the south-west of the province on 11 August. Consequently, Jackson reasoned that if the battle unfolding near Long Tan was the opening phase of an attack on Nui Dat the main assault was <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> and he would need the bulk of his forces to defend {{the task force}} base. He considered the commitment of A Company would tie up the bulk of 6 RAR and the artillery. Yet Townsend believed Nui Dat's defences sufficient to deter such an attack, even if they remained incomplete, while the strategic reserve held by US II FFV could also be enacted if required. Ultimately Jackson gave in-principle support to the plan but would not release the relief force until he thought it warranted.|$|E
500|$|Parsifal {{is one of}} the Wagner operas {{regularly}} {{presented at}} the Bayreuth Festival to this day. Among the more significant post-war productions was that directed in 1951 by Wieland Wagner, the composer's grandson. At the first Bayreuth Festival after World War II he presented a radical move away from literal representation of the Hall of the Grail or the Flowermaiden's bower. Instead, lighting effects and the bare minimum of scenery were used to complement Wagner's music. This production was heavily influenced by the ideas of the Swiss stage designer, Adolphe Appia. The reaction to this production was extreme: Ernest Newman, Richard Wagner's biographer described it as [...] "not only the best Parsifal I have ever seen and heard, but one of the three or four most moving spiritual experiences of my life". Others were appalled that Wagner's stage directions were being flouted. The conductor of the 1951 production, Hans Knappertsbusch, on being asked how he could conduct such a disgraceful travesty, declared that right up until the dress rehearsal he imagined that the stage decorations were <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Knappertsbusch was particularly upset by the omission of the dove which appears over Parsifal's head {{at the end of the}} opera, which he claimed inspired him to give better performances. To placate his conductor Wieland arranged to reinstate the dove, which descended on a string. What Knappertsbusch did not realise was that Wieland had made the length of the string long enough for the conductor to see the dove, but not for the audience. Wieland continued to modify and refine his Bayreuth production of Parsifal until his death in 1966. Martha Mödl created a [...] "complex, tortured Kundry in Wieland Wagner's revolutionary production of Parsifal during the festival's first postwar season," [...] and would remain the company's exclusive Kundry for the remainder of the decade.|$|E

Battle was joined at Wimpfen early in May and resulted in victory for the imperial forces.

2500|$|All {{that was}} <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> for Bradman when he toured England with the Australian team in 1930. [...] Bradman scored heavily, 974 runs {{at an average}} of 139.14 [...] {{including}} a then world record 334 at Leeds, two other double centuries and another single. [...] Watching these displays of batting was Douglas Jardine, playing for Surrey. [...] Following discussions with other observers such as Percy Fender and George Duckworth, he developed a tactic to limit the prodigious run scoring of Bradman and the others. [...] The tactic, originally called fast leg theory and later called bodyline involved fast short pitched bowling directed at the batsman's body and a packed leg side field. Appointed captain of England for the 1932-33 series in Australia, Jardine was able to put these theories into practice.|$|E
2500|$|In 1852, {{when his}} first major novels of Russian society were <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> Turgenev wrote an {{obituary}} for Nikolai Gogol, intended for publication in the Saint Petersburg Gazette. The key passage reads: [...] "Gogol is dead!... What Russian heart is not shaken by those three words?... He is gone, that man whom {{we now have the}} right (the bitter right, given to us by death) to call great." [...] The censor of Saint Petersburg did not approve of this and banned publication, but the Moscow censor allowed it to be published in a newspaper in that city. The censor was dismissed; but Turgenev was held responsible for the incident, imprisoned for a month, and then exiled to his country estate for nearly two years. [...] It was during this time that Turgenev wrote his short story Mumu ("Муму") in 1854. [...] The story tells a tale of a deaf and dumb peasant who is forced to drown the only thing in the world which brings him happiness, his dog Mumu. [...] Like his A Sportsman's Sketches (Записки охотника), this work takes aim at the cruelties of a serf society. This work was later applauded by John Galsworthy who claimed, [...] "no more stirring protest against tyrannical cruelty was ever penned in terms of art." ...|$|E

So it's as easy as them kind of recording everything, which is actually probably tough because they're constantly working with Scott on Stone Temple Pilot stuff. So the band is always there, you know what I mean, we're alive, we talk, Dean and I are constantly in communication. Ray Luzier, every time I see him he's like [...] "Man that Army of Anyone record is still, people still come up to me and talk about that Army of Anyone record".
