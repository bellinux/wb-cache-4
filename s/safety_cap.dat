5000|$|Proposals to cap non-economic damages {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} proposed tort reforms, and have generated controversy over their fairness, efficacy, and constitutionality. [...] Critics complain that limitations on punitive damages and other restrictions on plaintiff's traditional rights will reduce corporate accountability. [...] Because corporations engage in a cost-benefit analysis before considering whether to stop a wrongful action (such as polluting or not enacting proper measures for <b>safety),</b> <b>caps</b> on damages may well encourage corporate malfeasance. [...] They contend that the prospect of paying a small damage award provides too little incentive to correct the wrongdoing, and would allow the corporation to profitably continue an unsafe practice.|$|R
30|$|Three clinicians {{and three}} {{injection}} device engineers also provided input regarding differences among available injections devices for non-insulin medications, including strengths and inconveniences of each injection process, device attributes that clinicians consider when choosing which medication to prescribe, and expectations for future non-insulin injection devices. Key factors suggested to differentiate among injection devices included device preparation requirements, reconstitution procedures, adjustable dose selection (compared to fixed dose devices), patient confidence in preparing {{and using the}} device, needle handling requirements, needle visibility, needle <b>safety,</b> <b>capping</b> of the devices, and disposal of the devices. The results of the literature review and expert interviews were used to inform {{the development of the}} concept elicitation interview guide for step 3.|$|R

30|$|In step 2, six {{experts were}} interviewed about {{diabetes}} injection devices by telephone or in person. These experts included three clinicians {{who had worked}} with patients treated with non-insulin injectable medication (MD, MBBS, and RN) and three diabetes injection device engineers. These interviews focused on factors differentiating among diabetes injections devices; strengths and inconveniences of non-insulin injection devices that were available at the time; ways that injection devices may influence treatment decisions; device attributes clinicians consider when selecting a device; and execution for development of non-insulin injection devices in the future. Key factors said to differentiate among devices included device preparation requirements, reconstitution, adjustable dose selection (compared to fixed dose devices), patient confidence in using the device, needle handling requirements, needle visibility, needle <b>safety,</b> <b>capping,</b> disposal, overall ease of use, and single-use versus multiple-use devices. The results of steps 1 and 2 were used to develop a concept elicitation interview guide designed to elicit patient experiences with diabetes injection devices.|$|R

50|$|The British Army's first useful impact fuze for high-explosive shells was the Fuze No. 106 of World War I. (illus.) This used {{a simple}} {{protruding}} plunger or striker at the nose, which was pushed back {{to drive a}} firing pin into the detonator. Its ability to burst immediately at ground level was used to clear the barbed wire entanglements of no man's land, rather than burying itself first and leaving a deep, but useless, crater. The striker was protected by a <b>safety</b> <b>cap</b> that was removed before loading, {{but there was no}} other safety mechanism.|$|E

5000|$|In 2009 {{an effort}} to reclaim the {{property}} for historic gatherings was made by Jeff Gilder, founder of Racersreunion.com. In February 2009 {{a small group of}} volunteers met to clear brush, old cable and trees. From this small group grew a larger all volunteer work force that helped in razing two dilapidated restroom facilities, refurbishing the ticket booth, installing <b>safety</b> <b>caps</b> on the front stretch guardrails, and a safe parking lot. Several area construction companies provided earth moving equipment which was essential in removing a large mound of dirt blocking the ticket booth. One donated the materials and built an all-aluminum flag stand at the start-finish line. During the final weeks leading up to the festival, different volunteer crews could be found from sun up to sun down, seven days a week. No help was turned away in the spirit of making this a community project. Saturday volunteers were treated to a meat and three vegetable lunch provided Lizards Thicket, a local eatery, and delivered by John Wise and Rebecca Turner of Love Chevrolet, the event's sponsor. The first gathering was April 25. Over 30,000 fans from 17 states attended the [...] "First Annual Historic Columbia Speedway Spring Festival". The second annual event will be held April 14-17, 2010.|$|R
40|$|Background: The Alliance for Patient Medication Safety (APMS) helps {{community}} pharmacies {{comply with}} continuous quality improvement requirements of many states and third party payment contracts {{through use of}} their Pharmacy Quality Commitment (PQC) program. Aims: To assess changes {{in the incidence of}} prescription Quality Related Events (QREs) and adoption of patient safety culture attitudes after guided PQC implementation. Methods: Twenty-one pharmacies were randomized to standard PQC practices (control) or guided PQC implementation (treatment). Pharmacy staff completed retrospective pre and post safety culture questionnaires. Negative binomial mixed and linear regression analyses were employed to examine changes in QREs rates and attitudes, respectively. Rasch analysis was used to assess questionnaire validity and reliability. Results: During the 2 -month study period 3, 343 QREs were reported to the online PQC system. At baseline, no difference in the average QRE reporting rate was identified between groups. Treatment group QRE reporting rates differed in one category post treatment (more incorrect <b>safety</b> <b>caps</b> QREs reported in treatment group, p< 0. 034). Seventy-one employees completed the questionnaire (70 % response). Attitude improvement in the treatment group was 36 % greater than in control (p< 0. 0001). The questionnaire demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity evidence. Conclusions: Guided PQC implementation increased reporting of certain QREs and increased the adoption of patient safety culture attitudes among staff pharmacy...|$|R
50|$|A more {{sophisticated}} fuze is the double-acting fuze, which {{is sensitive to}} both contact and grazing. An {{example of such a}} double-acting fuze is the British WW II Fuze, D.A. and percussion, No. 119 This fuze uses a nose striker, as for the original No. 106, but is rather more complex with an added inertia mechanism for grazing impacts and also three automatic safety devices. Simple contact impacts drive the striker back into the detonating pellet, as before. Graze impacts trigger the inertia mechanism, where instead the pellet in a heavy carrying plug travels forwards onto the striker. The striker is protected in storage by a nose <b>safety</b> <b>cap.</b> Normally this is removed before loading, but it may also be left in place if the target is behind cover. This reduces the sensitivity of the striker to light impacts through vegetation, but the fuze will still function through the inertia mechanism, or through a hard impact. Three safety devices are provided, one released by inertia during firing, which then unlocks a second that is released by centrifugal force of the spinning shell. These are mechanical locks that prevent the striker contacting the pellet. A third device is a centrifugal shutter that initially blocks propagation from the detonator pellet to the booster explosive.|$|E
50|$|For the 2015-16 Formula E season Félix da Costa {{retained}} {{his seat}} with Team Aguri but had several good races {{taken away from}} his due to unreliability. For the first 3 races of the season he raced alongside Nathanaël Berthon before the French driver was dropped in favor of season 1 driver Salvador Durán, who himself was replaced by Ma Qinghua just 3 races later in to the season. Due to DTM commitments da Costa was unable to race the 2016 Berlin ePrix and was himself replaced by René Rast for the race, he would return for the double header to end the season in London. Da Costa's best finish of the season was 6th place which he achieved 3 times, at Putrajaya, Punta del Este and London(1). During the 2015 Beijing ePrix he was running in the podium positions when the car had a mechanical failure putting {{him out of the}} ePrix. At the 2016 Buenos Aires ePrix he was going for a potential back to back win at the track when another car failure, this time a <b>safety</b> <b>cap</b> piece, put him out of the race. Again bad luck would strike the Portuguese driver at the 2016 Long Beach ePrix when he claimed a sensational pole position only to be disqualified due to his right rear tyre pressure being 0.3psi below minimum. At the 2016 London ePrix for race 2 da Costa finished an impressive 4th only to have a penalty for using too much power demote him to 9th, then a second penalty for track limits down to 11th. When the season had finished, Motorsport.com placed him 4th overall in the top 10 drivers of the season due to keeping cool at all times even when faced with so much bad luck.|$|E
30|$|Some of the {{identified}} errors are clearly attributable to shortcomings in usability. For example, the high {{frequency with which}} auto-injectors were held upside down is obviously due to insufficient identification of safety caps or the end with a needle (e.g. usage of inappropriate colors (Bakirtas et al., 2011)) or the symmetry of the two ends of a device (Guerlain et al., 2010 a). One can assume that these design defects {{have contributed to the}} unintentional injections in fingers and hands mentioned in a number of publications (Stauder et al., 2014; Guerlain et al., 2010 a; Bakirtas et al., 2011; Mehr et al., 2007; Arga et al., 2011). Unclear identification might also contribute to failure to remove the <b>safety</b> <b>cap</b> prior to injection – a relatively common use error. The risk of the occurrence of this type of error could be decreased by better design choices. One study demonstrated that simple design modifications (like changing the color of the <b>safety</b> <b>cap</b> and adding an arrow indicating the correct device orientation) were associated with a significantly lower frequency of needle-stick injuries and a significantly shorter application time (Bakirtas et al., 2011).|$|E
40|$|It is {{frequently}} assumed that safe storage gun laws reduce accidental gun deaths and total suicides, while the possible impact on crime rates are ignored. However, given existing {{work on the}} adverse impact of other safety laws, such as <b>safety</b> <b>caps</b> for storing medicine, even the very plausible assumption of reduced accidental gun deaths cannot be taken for granted. Our paper analyzes both state and county data spanning nearly twenty years, and we find no support that safe storage laws reduce either juvenile accidental gun deaths or suicides. Instead, these storage requirements appear to impair people's ability to use guns defensively. Because accidental shooters {{also tend to be}} the ones most likely to violate the new law, safe storage laws increase violent and property crimes against low risk citizens with no observable offsetting benefit in terms of reduced accidents or suicides. During the first five full years after the passage of the safe storage laws, the group of fifteen states that adopted these laws faced an annual average increase of over 300 more murders, 3, 860 more rapes, 24, 650 more robberies, and over 25, 000 more aggravated assaults. On average, the annual costs borne by victims averaged over $ 2. 6 billion as a result of lost productivity, out-of-pocket expenses, medical bills, and property losses. gun control, crime, suicide, accidental death...|$|R
