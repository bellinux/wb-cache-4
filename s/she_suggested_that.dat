5|$|Arriving in Iaşi (Jassy) in 1876, Goldfaden was {{fortunate}} to be better known as a good poet — many of whose poems had been set to music and had become popular songs — than as a less-than-successful businessman. Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was uninterested in that proposition. Librescu's wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism was {{just a way to}} starve; <b>she</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{there would be a lot}} more of a market for Yiddish-language theater. Librescu offered Goldfaden 100 francs for a public recital of his songs in the garden of Shimen Mark, Grădina Pomul Verde ("the Green Fruit-Tree Garden").|$|E
5|$|Mary Shelley {{submitted}} the play for publication to The Browning Box, edited by Bryan Walter Procter, in 1824; it was rejected. In 1830, she submitted it to Rudolph Ackermann {{for publication in}} his children's magazine Forget-Me-Not; it was again rejected. In 1832, she sent it to Alaric Alexander Watts for consideration in his annual Literary Souvenir, however in her letter <b>she</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the drama may be more appropriate for the juvenile publications edited by his wife, Priscilla Maden Watts. The drama {{was first published in}} 1922 by literary scholar A. Koszul.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{referred}} to the Natural Resources Committee, which then referred it to its Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans, chaired by Bordallo. Hearings were held a week later, at which Shelley Clarke, a researcher at Imperial College London who studies the shark-fin trade, observed that transshipment operations such as the KD IIs were common and would likely continue as the competition in Hong Kong, the industry's traditional center, grew more intense. While the transshipment ban was an effective response to the decision, <b>she</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> shipments of containerized fins be allowed {{if they had been}} separated from their carcasses after landing.|$|E

5|$|These {{findings}} were contested {{a few years}} later by Catherine Forster, who reanalyzed Triceratops material more comprehensively and concluded that the remains fell into two species, T. horridus and T. prorsus, although the distinctive skull of T. ("Nedoceratops") hatcheri differed enough to warrant a separate genus. She found that T. horridus and several other species belonged together, and T. prorsus and T. brevicornus stood alone, and since there were many more specimens in the first group, <b>she</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> this meant the two groups were two species. It is still possible to interpret the differences as representing a single species with sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|Exton {{submitted}} {{his report}} to Madeleine's Fund in November 2008, but the fund told Exton {{that the report}} and its e-fits had to remain confidential. The relationship between {{the company and the}} fund had soured, in part because of a dispute over fees, and in part because the report was critical of the McCanns and their friends; it suggested that Madeleine may have died in an accident after leaving the apartment herself through its unlocked patio doors. The fund passed the e-fits to the police—the Polícia Judiciária and Leicestershire police had them by October 2009, and Scotland Yard received them when they became involved in August 2011—but did not otherwise release them. Kate McCann did not include them with the other images of suspects in her book, Madeleine (2011), although <b>she</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> both the Tanner and Smith sightings were crucial.|$|E
25|$|With the {{election}} of William Rowan Hamilton to president of the Royal Irish Academy, Maria became a dominant source of advice for Hamilton, particularly {{on the issue of}} literature in Ireland. <b>She</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> women should be allowed to participate in events held by the academy. For her guidance and help, Hamilton made Edgeworth an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1837, {{following in the footsteps of}} Louisa Beaufort, a former member of the academy and a relative of hers.|$|E

25|$|The {{historian}} Alwyn Ruddock {{worked on}} Cabot and his era for 35 years. <b>She</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Cabot and his expedition successfully returned to England {{in the spring}} of 1500. She claimed their return followed an epic two-year exploration of the east coast of North America, south into the Chesapeake Bay area and perhaps as far as the Spanish territories in the Caribbean. Her evidence included the well-known world map of the Spanish cartographer Juan de la Cosa. His chart included the North American coast and seas 'discovered by the English' between 1497 and 1500.|$|E
25|$|From 2006 to 2009, O'Toole was {{supported}} by two other inspectors, Robert Olsen and Gwen M. Boniface. Olsen was Chief of Police for 8 years of the Minneapolis Police Department. Boniface is a former Commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police, {{and was one of}} 3 female police commissioners in Canada when appointed in May 1998. <b>She</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> rank and file Gardaí were not equipped to perform their duties or protect themselves properly. She also suggested that routine arming may become a reality but dismissed the suggestion that this was currently being considered.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the last}} {{mentions}} of the castle was in 1569, following the Catholic Rising of the North: Mary Queen of Scots was rushed south from Tutbury Castle to Coventry. Elizabeth I sent a letter, instructing the people of Coventry to look after Mary. <b>She</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Mary be held somewhere secure such as Coventry Castle. However, by {{that time it was}} too decayed and Mary was instead first held at the Bull Inn, Smithford Street before being moved to the Mayoress's Parlour in St. Mary's Guildhall. Following the defeat of the rebels, Mary was once more sent north to Chatsworth in May 1570.|$|E

25|$|After a {{few months}} on the job, Hancock came to the {{conclusion}} that the situation was hopeless; given current development and engineering, she felt Copland would never ship. Instead, <b>she</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the various user-facing technologies in Copland be rolled out in a series of staged releases, instead of a single big release. To address the aging infrastructure below these technologies, Amelio suggested looking outside the company for an entirely new operating system. Candidates considered were Sun's Solaris and Windows NT. Hancock reportedly was in favor of going with Solaris, while Amelio preferred Windows. Amelio even reportedly called Bill Gates to discuss the idea, and Gates promised to put Microsoft engineers to work porting QuickDraw to NT.|$|E
25|$|In 1930 she {{received}} a scholarship from the Brunswig Drug Corporation to attend the University of Southern California. She graduated with a Major in business, in 1935. It was in 1935 that she married her first husband Roy Quick. Also in that year, Collins {{got a job as}} the Personnel manager of Brunswig Drug Corporation. She recommended a number of changes to the President of the company; <b>she</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the employees should be paid according to their performance and job type, regardless of gender. Because of the subsequent improvement in productivity Collins was financed, in 1937, to attend the Harvard-Radcliffe Training Course in Personnel Administration. In 1938, she was one of five who graduated from the first course.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, Helen Singer Kaplan {{added the}} {{category}} of desire to the cycle, which she argued precedes sexual excitation. She stated that emotions of anxiety, defensiveness {{and the failure of}} communication can interfere with desire and orgasm. In the late 1980s and after, Rosemary Basson proposed a more cyclical alternative to what had largely been viewed as linear progression. In her model, desire feeds arousal and orgasm, and is in turn fueled {{by the rest of the}} orgasmic cycle. Rather than orgasm being the peak of the sexual experience, <b>she</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> it is just one point in the circle and that people could feel sexually satisfied at any stage, reducing the focus on climax as an end-goal of all sexual activity.|$|E

25|$|Elders drew fire, {{as well as}} censure {{from the}} Clinton administration, when <b>she</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> legalizing drugs might help reduce crime and that the idea should be studied. On December 15, 1993, around one week after making these comments, charges were filed against her son Kevin, for selling cocaine in an {{incident}} involving undercover officers, four months prior. Elders believes the incident was a frame-up and {{the timing of the}} charges was designed to embarrass her and the president. Kevin Elders was convicted, and he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He appealed his conviction to the Arkansas Supreme Court, and that court reaffirmed the conviction. The court held that Mr. Elders failed to show that he was entrapped into making the narcotics sale. There was no further appeal.|$|E
25|$|James Law was the {{minister}} for several isolated townships, {{and had to}} travel between them by horse, boat and on foot. To supplement the family income, he bought a small farm on the Richibucto River, which Bonar helped tend along with his brothers Robert, William and John, and his sister Mary. Studying at the local village school, Law excelled at his studies, and {{it is here that}} he was first noted for his excellent memory. After Eliza Law died in 1861, her sister Janet travelled to New Brunswick from her home in Scotland to look after the Law children. When James Law remarried in 1870, his new wife took over Janet's duties, and Janet decided to return home to Scotland. <b>She</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Bonar Law should come with her, as the Kidston family were wealthier and better connected than the Laws, and Bonar would have a more privileged upbringing. Both James and Bonar accepted this, and Bonar left with Janet, never to return to Kingston.|$|E
25|$|Still with {{dreams of}} {{becoming}} a culture expert, he moved to Philadelphia to become an instructor at Herman's Institute, while Fanny stayed in New York to finish her studies. Before his first professional fight, Welsh decided to change his name, fearing he may fail and that his mother would find out he was boxing. He first chose Fred Cymry, Cymry meaning Welsh, but on writing to Fanny, <b>she</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> 'Welsh' would be less confusing. Welsh took Jack Clancy on as his American manager, and on 21 December 1905 he experienced his first professional bout. His first opponent was Young Williams, and the two novices fought at the Broadway Athletic Club of Philadelphia. Welsh won by knockout in the third round, and was booked {{to return to the}} club for his second fight in January. He went six rounds with Johnny Keely on 25 January, with a 'no-decision' verdict, the standard practice in Philadelphia for full-distance fights at the time, given to the fight. His next match saw him stop Eddie Fay in the sixth, and with this promising start to his career, the Broadway Athletic Club lined up a more challenging opponent, journeyman Tommy Feltz. The fight went all six rounds, and although Feltz was past his best, he was expected to win the bout; so the result, given to Welsh by the Philadelphia Item, was seen as an upset. From that fight, Welsh started to take more frequent matches, sometimes accepting two bouts a week to build up his experience and stamina. In March 1906, he faced four opponents, defeating Tommy Love and Kid Stinger (both 'no-decision', but given by the Philadelphia Item) and then a points win over Eddie Lenny, followed by a draw with Johnny Dohan. The Lenny result was the first of eight bouts to which the Philadelphia Item failed to give Welsh a victory, though seven of them were 'no-decision' verdicts on the night. The seven matches after Dohan were Billy Maharg, who took the fight decisively on points, then Frank Carsey, followed by three experienced fighters, Jimmy Devine, Tommy Love and Matty Baldwin; the last two opponents on this losing streak were Philadelphians Billy Willis and Tim Callahan.|$|E

40|$|Jacqueline Bhabha {{discusses}} what {{it means}} for a child to be a citizen in today's globalizing world, given that many of the cardinal attributes of citizenship – including the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to stand for public office – are denied children. No other group of citizens has such partial access to the benefits of membership. <b>She</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> citizenship is a neglected, undervalued status for children, because the attributes of citizenship are routinely evaluated from an adult-centred viewpoint.
