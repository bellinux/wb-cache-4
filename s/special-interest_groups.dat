50|$|Because logrolling allows <b>special-interest</b> <b>groups</b> a {{voice in}} the {{political}} process, programs that benefit a minority group can get the approval of a majority. However, this may not be {{in the best interest of}} the majority. <b>Special-interest</b> <b>groups</b> typically do not represent the typical voter, but rather, small branches of minority ideologies (Holcombe 2006). Voting results with or without logrolling will differ only if the minority is more interested in an issue than the majority, enough to separate the marginal voters from the majority. Studies show that lobbying and political pressure exerted by <b>special-interest</b> <b>groups</b> are not atypical behavior in a modern democracy (Buchanan and Tullock 1962).

40|$|Agencies in the {{executive}} branch are better situated than other political institutions to take advantage of opportunities to expand their power base by responding quickly and decisively to real or imagined crises. The executive has structural advantages over the other branches because it can respond faster to perceived emergencies. Congress is hampered more than {{the executive}} by gridlock caused by <b>special-interest</b> <b>group</b> pressures when it tries to act quicky. The legislative process is also inherently slower than the executive process because the executive can launch into unilateral action, as by filing a lawsuit. The executive 2 ̆ 7 s structural advantage over the judiciary is even more complete than its advantage over Congress because the judiciary has no power to initiate action. Executive action, particularly that of agencies, determines the course of law. This Essay argues that the ascendancy of the executive branch in policymaking is an unintended consequence of the modern administrative state. The emergence of the executive as the fulcrum of power within the administrative state upsets the traditional balance of powers among the three branches of government. This imbalance can be counteracted only by a concerted effort by the federal judiciary to rein in executive power that improperly usurps Congress 2 ̆ 7 s authority to make law...|$|R

50|$|While good {{government}} {{tends to be}} a pure public good for the mass of voters, there may be many advocacy groups that have strong incentives for lobbying the government to implement specific policies that would benefit them, potentially {{at the expense of the}} general public. For example, lobbying by the sugar manufacturers might result in an inefficient subsidy for the production of sugar, either direct or by protectionist measures. The costs of such inefficient policies are dispersed over all citizens, and therefore unnoticeable to each individual. On the other hand, the benefits are shared by a small <b>special-interest</b> <b>group</b> with a strong incentive to perpetuate the policy by further lobbying. Due to rational ignorance, the vast majority of voters will be unaware of the effort; in fact, although voters may be aware of special-interest lobbying efforts, this may merely select for policies which are even harder to evaluate by the general public, rather than improving their overall efficiency. Even if the public were able to evaluate policy proposals effectively, they would find it infeasible to engage in collective action in order to defend their diffuse interest. Therefore, theorists expect that numerous special interests will be able to successfully lobby for various inefficient policies. In public choice theory, such scenarios of inefficient government policies are referred to as government failure - a term akin to market failure from earlier theoretical welfare economics.|$|R

40|$|The Bunker Hill Monument, a 220 -foot high granite obelisk {{built from}} 1825 - 1842, {{stands on a}} grassy mound known as Monument Square. Today the {{situation}} of the monument incites curiosity, standing as it does amidst brick and wooden rowhouses in a residential area of Charlestown, Mass. The Bunker Hill Monument Association (BHMA), builder of the obelisk, was also responsible for the planning and development of 15 acres surrounding it. These memorial builders - lawyers, doctors, and businessmen - became investors in America's first commercial railroad, part of the network moving the granite blocks. They also became real estate developers - {{to help pay for the}} expensive monument, the BHMA sold part of the "sacred" battlefield as houselots. Many factors, some familiar today and others quite remote, shaped the monument and its surround: technological innovation and capitalism, land-use economics, and at least one <b>special-interest</b> <b>group</b> - the freemasons. Through historical research and visual analysis, this thesis studies these factors as part of the process through which the product, Monument Square, emerged. The construction time period of the monument coincided with a fundamental change in Charlestown housing: the transition from semi-rural detached homes to the rowhouse. The houses of Monument Square, built on the land sold by the BHMA, afford the opportunity to study communal agreement as to the form of this newly emerging urbanity. This agreement is sometimes explicit, as in the innovative deed restrictions, but also implicit in aspects of house design not covered by the restrictions. The durable monument and its open square have helped to maintain the robustness of the area, which escaped the widespread clearance which occurred in other parts of Charlestown during the 1960 's. by Ellen Jane Katz.
