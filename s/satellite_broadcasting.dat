5|$|Premier League chief {{executive}} Rick Parry and chairman Sir John Quinton were assigned {{the task of}} finding suitors. Parry initially favoured working with ITV, led by Greg Dyke, but wanted the network to pay in excess of £30 million for live football. In the meantime BSkyB – a company formed by the merger of Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television, and British <b>Satellite</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> – looked into the possibility of obtaining live rights to the Premier League. BSkyB {{chief executive}} Sam Chisholm attempted to make a joint offer with ITV which did not come into fruition, so he formed an alliance with the BBC, aware the corporation wanted a highlights package. Although Chisholm was against Parry's idea of a football-only channel, he built a rapport with the Premier League and his company invited Parry to its facilities in Livingston, where he spoke to Murdoch in person.|$|E

There he covered live FA Cup games, England internationals and the Scottish League. Tyler's voice was still heard on ITV for another two years as they carried the commentaries he provided for the Football League's overseas broadcasts. British <b>Satellite</b> <b>Broadcasting's</b> merger with Sky meant the Sports Channel became Sky Sports in 1991.

25|$|In 1985 a pan-European {{satellite}} service was launched through SES. The service provided viewers with pan-European channels which targeted the entire continent. On 5 February 1989, when Sky Television launched. British <b>Satellite</b> <b>Broadcasting,</b> {{which was also}} available in Ireland, launched in 1990 and the two merged to form British Sky Broadcasting in 1990. For most of the 1990s however, Sky's DBS customer base in Ireland was dwarfed by the large numbers receiving its channels via cable. Sky Digital, Ireland's first digital television service, launched on October 1998. However, {{in the absence of}} any subsidy for the Sky Digibox in Ireland – viewers in the UK could avail of both a Sky subsidy and one from British Interactive Broadcasting – the cost to initially acquire Sky Digital equipment was very expensive (IEP 450) and subscriber numbers did not rise until both these subsidies were introduced into Ireland in 2000. In 2001, UK and Irish terrestrial channels became available to Irish Sky customers for the first time.|$|E
25|$|In 1998 EchoStar {{purchased}} the broadcasting assets of a <b>satellite</b> <b>broadcasting</b> joint venture of News Corporation and MCI Worldcom, called ASkyB (for American Sky Broadcasting, named after News Corp's BSkyB service in Britain); {{the two companies}} had nearly merged (which called for Dish Network being renamed Sky) before it was called off due to Charlie Ergen's clashes with News Corp. executives. With this purchase EchoStar obtained 28 of the 32 transponder licenses in the 110° West orbital slot, more than doubling existing continental United States broadcasting capacity at a value of $682.5 million; {{some of the other}} assets were picked up by rival PrimeStar, which was sold to DirecTV in 1999. The acquisition (which also included an uplink center in Gilbert, Arizona) inspired the company to introduce a multi satellite system called Dish 500, theoretically capable of receiving more than 500 channels on one Dish. In the same year, Echostar, partnering with Bell Canada, launched Dish Network Canada.|$|E

40|$|The {{dawn of the}} 1990 's has {{witnessed}} {{the birth of a}} new satellite service - <b>satellite</b> sound <b>broadcasting.</b> This new service is characterized by digital transmission at data rates up to 256 kb/s from satellites in geostationary orbit to small, low-cost, mobile and portable receivers. The <b>satellite</b> sound <b>broadcasting</b> service is a logical step beyond navigation satellite service, such as that provided by the GPS Navstar system. The mass market appeal of <b>satellite</b> sound <b>broadcasting</b> in the area of lightsat technology and low-cost digital radios has greatly facilitated the financing of this type of space service...|$|R
25|$|In October 1984, the U.S. Congress {{passed the}} Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, which gave those using TVRO systems {{the right to}} receive signals for free unless they were scrambled, and {{required}} those who did scramble to make their signals available for a reasonable fee. Since cable channels could prevent reception by big dishes, other companies had an incentive to offer competition. In January 1986, HBO began using the now-obsolete VideoCipher II system to encrypt their channels. Other channels uses less secure television encryption systems. The scrambling of HBO was met with much protest from owners of big-dish systems, most of which had no other option at the time for receiving such channels, claiming that clear signals from cable channels {{would be difficult to}} receive. Eventually HBO allowed dish owners to subscribe directly to their service for $12.95 per month, a price equal to or higher than what cable subscribers were paying, and required a descrambler to be purchased for $395. This led to the attack on HBO's transponder Galaxy 1 by John R. MacDougall in April 1986. One by one, all commercial channels followed HBO's lead and began scrambling their channels. The <b>Satellite</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> and Communications Association SBCA was founded on December 2, 1986 {{as the result of a}} merger between SPACE and the Direct Broadcast Satellite Association (DBSA).|$|E
500|$|The Premier League {{was created}} [...] "to prevent the top clubs from losing income {{to the lower}} leagues", but also served the purpose of {{maximising}} the clubs' bargaining position for when the next television contract was up for renewal. ITV held exclusive rights to live Football League matches, having paid £44 million over a four-year period (1988–1992). The arrangement came after the withdrawal of a joint bid made by the BBC and British <b>Satellite</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> (BSB). Both broadcasters later obtained rights to FA Cup football.|$|E
500|$|Football in England {{had reached}} its nadir in 1985 as clubs were banned from European {{competition}} {{for five years}} following the Heysel Stadium disaster. In the same year, the Kenilworth Road riot – scuffles between fans of Millwall and Luton Town – resulted in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government setting up a [...] "war cabinet" [...] to combat football hooliganism. Incidents like the aforementioned tarnished the sport's reputation, but commercial interest grew. In August 1988, ITV paid £44 million over four seasons to broadcast live First Division matches. The arrangement came about as British <b>Satellite</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> withdrew its joint offer with the BBC, unhappy at how the clubs were run. By November 1988 the government issued a broadcasting shakeup, which aided the growth of multichannel satellite television. ITV's contract therefore acted as a precursor to rising broadcasting deals and growing pressures to keep the top clubs in line.|$|E

No points for current wife Rebecca, ten for naming Lynn, Gail, or Christina Alessi, and 1,400 points for remembering first wife, plumber Terry [...] Yes, Paul's been around the block." [...] They also branded him as the reason Neighbours, in their opinion was good viewing in the 2000s adding: [...] "It's his cackling soap villain role that we love to hate him for: his return in 2004, torching Lassiter's and befriending Dylan, marked the start of Neighbours getting awesome in the mid-noughties. Although it's probably {{safe to say that}} period was over by the time he suffered amnesia of everything after 1989." [...] He has also been branded as a [...] "legend character". Entertainment reporting website Last Broadcast praised Paul's development, stating: [...] "As the kind of shady character who'd do anything to make a fast buck, he even planned to bulldoze Ramsay Street {{to make way for a}} new supermarket development. And that's not all: fraud, blackmail, murder; there is no level to which Paul wouldn't have sunk. Yet, the infamous bad boy of Erinsborough, has, thankfully, turned over a new leaf." ...|$|E
