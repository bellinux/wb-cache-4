40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} examine the effect on picture naming of the prior production of a word related in phonological form. In Experiment 1, the latency to produce Dutch words in response to pictures (e. g., hoed, hat) was longer following {{the production of a}} form-related word (e. g., hond, dog) in response to a definition on a preceding trial, than when the preceding definition elicited an unrelated word (e. g., kerk, church). Experiment 2 demonstrated that the inhibitory effect disappears when one unrelated word is produced intervening prime and target productions (e. g., hond-kerk-hoed). The size of the inhibitory effect was not significantly affected by the frequency of the prime words or the target picture names. In Experiment 3, facilitation was observed for word pairs that shared offset <b>segments</b> (<b>e.</b> g., kurk-jurk, cork-dress), whereas inhibition was observed for shared onset <b>segments</b> (<b>e.</b> g., bloed-bloem, blood-flower). However, no priming was observed for prime and target words with shared phonemes but no mismatching <b>segments</b> (<b>e.</b> g., oom-boom, uncle-tree; hex-hexs, fence-witch). These findings are consistent with a process of phoneme competition during phonological encoding...|$|R

Tasks detecting onsets and rhymes in a "similarity format" were found to be easier for Chinese children than those in an "oddity format. " In addition, cross-linguistic comparisons indicated that Chinese children develop an awareness of initial consonants and rhymes later than their English counterparts.

40|$|In four experiments, {{participants}} named target {{pictures that}} {{were accompanied by}} distractor pictures with phonologically related or unrelated names.

5000|$|The multi year {{reconstruction}} of I-10 {{was completed in}} 2008 while US 290 reconstruction was not due to even start until 2011. [...] " [...] The 22 mi long section of I-10 from the suburb town of Katy to just inside the I-610 loop has expanded it to handle the rapidly expanding western suburbs of Houston not just adding lanes, but also an expanded HOV with two lanes in both directions where there was one lane reversed {{back and forth with}} rush hour and a toll lane for commuters willing to pay congestion prices for the quicker ride. The idea put forth is that <b>Segment</b> <b>E</b> is toll-viable from the start meaning it would pay for itself with tolls collected because of the need to relieve traffic on US 290 along with the continued expansion of the western suburbs. After US 290 construction is completed and less traffic is diverting down the E Segment of the Grand Parkway; the reasoning is that the inevitable population explosion going on in the area would not just replace the lost traffic from the US 290 completion, but increase its use.|$|E
