50|$|Eclecticism is a {{nineteenth and}} twentieth-century {{architectural}} style {{in which a}} <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> of <b>work</b> incorporates a mixture of elements from previous historical styles to create something that is new and original. In architecture and interior design, these elements may include structural features, furniture, decorative motives, distinct historical ornament, traditional cultural motifs or styles from other countries, with the mixture usually chosen based on its suitability to the project and overall aesthetic value.|$|R
50|$|In both canvas {{work and}} surface {{embroidery}} an embroidery hoop or frame {{can be used}} to stretch the material and ensure even stitching tension that prevents pattern distortion. Modern canvas work tends to follow symmetrical counted stitching patterns with designs emerging from the repetition of one or just a few similar stitches in a variety of hues. In contrast, many forms of surface embroidery make use {{of a wide range of}} stitching patterns in a <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> of <b>work.</b>|$|R

40|$|Traditionally {{operated}} garment {{industries are}} facing problems like low productivity, longer production lead time, high rework and rejection, poor line balancing, low flexibility of style changeover etc. These problems were {{addressed in this}} study by the implementation of lean tools like cellular manufacturing, <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> flow, <b>work</b> standardization, just in time production etc. After implementation of lean tools, results observed were highly encouraging. Some of the key benefits entail production cycle time decreased by 8 %, number of operators required to produce equal amount of garment is decreased by 14 %, rework level reduced by 80 %, production lead time comes down to one hour from two days, work in progress inventory stays at a maximum of 100 pieces from around 500 to 1500 pieces. Apart from these tangible benefits operator multi-skilling {{as well as the}} flexibility of style changeover has been improved.

5000|$|The {{stages of}} the firing can be varied but {{typically}} start to climb at quite a rapid rate until the heat places the glass in an [...] "orange state" [...] i.e., flexible. At that point, gravity will allow the glass to slump into the mold and the temperature is held at a constant for a period that {{is known as the}} [...] "soak". Following this stage, the kiln is allowed to cool slowly so that the slumped glass can anneal and be removed from the kiln. If two differing colours of glass are used in a <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> of <b>work,</b> the same CoE (Coefficient of thermal Expansion) glass must be used, or the finished piece will suffer from fractures as the glass will shrink at differing rates and allow tension to build up to the point of destruction. To compensate for this, many glass manufacturers subscribe to make glass to the same CoE. Examples include Spectrum glass system 96 or uroborus 96 series, and the use of this glass will allow the cooling to remain uniform and ensure that no tension builds up as the work cools.|$|R

He noted that it contains [...] "all honking brass and a preference for tempos that slide up the scale like liquor, getting hot just as they hit the chorus". Logan Smithson of the webzine PopMatters commented that an important function of a soundtrack is, [...] "... to maintain a cohesive sound: a general theme to piece the tracks together and {{make it sound like}} a <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> of <b>work</b> rather than a collection of songs." [...] He felt that the soundtrack accomplished this feat although the artists come from a mixture of genres and backgrounds. He further noted, [...] "The Great Gatsby Soundtrack does its job of capturing the sound of the Roaring '20s. A fusion of horns brings the era to life with a modern twist. Jazzy melodies are captured by the Bryan Ferry Orchestra. Some songs certainly have a neo-soul vibe going, reminiscent of the late Amy Winehouse." ...|$|R

The moral purpose of the whole, which he asserted {{in the preface to}} the first edition of Waverley, was involved always with the minutest study of the effects of true and false religion on the conduct;--which subject being always touched with his utmost lightness of hand and stealthiness of art, and founded on a knowledge of the Scotch character and the human heart, such as no other living man possessed, his purpose often escapes first observation as completely as the inner feelings of living people do; and I am myself amazed, as I take any <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> of his <b>work</b> up for examination, to find how many of its points I had before missed or disregarded.|$|R

5000|$|There was major {{restoration}} {{started in}} 1873 by John Dando Sedding {{which was a}} genuine restoration rather than a reconstruction. The restoration work involved {{the replacement of the}} oak roof and re-leading. However, the restoration undertaken by the architect was viewed favourably by those who preferred the preservation of fabric rather than its replacement. The Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser wrote on 25 August 1874: It is a relief to find so fine and pure a specimen of fourteenth century architecture in trustworthy hands. We have not to complain here as in so many instances of so-called restoration of that passion for the destruction of old work which, on the plea of restoration, has removed some of the most characteristic features of our ancient Gothic buildings. No <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> of old <b>work</b> not obviously unfit from decay to remain has been allowed to disappear.

40|$|Abstract: An {{introduction}} to lean manufacturing {{is one of}} the core courses taken by students majoring in Industrial Technology at Purdue University. The main objective of the course is to familiarize students with the most prominent operations management strategy (lean production/manufacturing) that company’s world wide have adopted and are adopting. The course is structured by connecting its content with the context it refers to; that of a problem-based context. During the semester, students are exposed to lean concepts and implementation strategies in the classroom and company’s respectively. Lecture material spans the core principles of lean, developed by Womack and Jones in their book “Lean Thinking”, to case studies illustrating its implementation. In the laboratory section of the class students are familiarized with facility layouts and the impact they have on implementation of spatial lean techniques, such as Cellular Layouts, <b>Single</b> <b>Piece</b> Flow, and <b>Work</b> In Progress buffers. In addition, students get a chance to visit two manufacturing facilities at different phases of their lean journey, documenting any room for improvement they might have noticed on the tour. This paper proposes a possible conceptual model for the teaching of an introductory level lean manufacturing course. I...|$|R

About 60% {{of the visitors}} are from the Valley of Mexico, 20% {{from other parts of}} Mexico, 15% from Toluca proper and 5% are foreigners. The building completed 100 years of age in 2009, prompting renovation work. The building stone on the outside was cleaned, new lighting added and damage to the lead soldering due to climate repaired. Since the colors of the glass are integrated and not painted on, they do not degrade. The only occasional damage is the breaking of a glass piece when someone throws a rock, which happens very rarely even though 48 of the 71 panels face the street. To date, not a <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> of the <b>work</b> has broken due to earthquake, in part due to the careful work done in engineering the supports for the windows. Keeping the windows clean requires two full-time workers. It takes Cirilo Hernandez Garcia and Cristobal Gonzalez Martinez one year and three months to make a round cleaning all half million glass pieces, a job they have been doing for 25 years. The cleaning is done with only water, a fine wire brush and rags, as chemicals damage the glass.|$|R
