Newly acquired stratigraphic and structural data, backed up by literature review, highlight that during the Rupelian to Serravallian time span, sedimentation was controlled by a left-lateral transpressive system. This system, here named as the Enza Valley Deformation Zone (EVDZ), is SW–NE directed and trends obliquely to the main regional NW–SE-directed structural axis characterizing this part of the Northern Apennines nowadays. The syn-sedimentary activity is testified by: (1) local to regional <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>unconformities,</b> (2) lateral variations of sedimentary facies associations, (3) thickness changes of the stratigraphic units and (4) the occurrence of mass transport deposits.

To date, most orbital observations which attest to past fluvial and lacustrine activity on Mars have been dedicated to surficial landforms (i. e., drainage networks and depositional fans). Here we report an unprecedented identification of typical stratigraphic architectures made in Mars Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera images of layered material in southern Melas Chasma. A particular set of strata is arranged in three depositional sequences bounded by <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>unconformities.</b> The sequences show spectacular, steeply-inclined clinoforms, and a broad channel-like depression. There are the same complex stratal patterns in Valles Marineris on Mars as there are in terrestrial deposits.

40|$|In the {{platforms}} of the Mesozoic southeastern {{continental margin}} of the Iberian plate (the Betic Margin), a major <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>unconformity</b> developed at - 83 Ma (earliest Campanian), which is interpreted -on the basis of regional stratigraphic analysis and interregional correlation- to mark {{the onset of the}} transition of the Betic passive margin into a convergent one. The unconformity was induced by a tectonic event that caused: (1) total restructuring of the platform, (2) changes in tectonic subsidence patterns, (3) rejuvenation of silicidastic source areas, and (4) substantial modifications in fossil assemblages, some of them with biogeographic implications. Correlation with other paleogeographic domains of Iberia (Pyrenean basin, Cantabrian margin, Iberian Seaway) allows to propose a supraregional control for that tectonic event now recognized in the betic Margin: it coincides in time with initiation of convergence in Pyrenees, with the end of sea-floor spreading in Bay of Biscay, and with a generalized uplift in central Iberia and the Iberian basin.

Approximately half of the species described have not been previously recorded from Nevada, six species are left in open nomenclature. Infraorder Neograptina and Styracograptus gen. nov. are erected. The maximum graptolite diversity is in organic-rich black shale in {{the lower part of}} the pacificus Biozone in the Vinini Formation. Species diversity decreased abruptly at the top of the Diceratograptus mirus Subzone, recognized herein in the upper part of the pacificus Biozone. Faunal turnover reached a peak in the lower part of early Hirnantian extraordinarius Biozone where long-dominant Ordovician clades (diplograptines) are rapidly replaced by normalograptids (Neograptina), presumably evolved in, and invading from, a less-temperate higher latitude. Eight late Katian diplograptine species recur in the upper part of the extraordinarius Biozone but, in contrast to their former abundance, are present there only as very rare individuals. Even more unusually, eight diplograptine species (members of Dicellograptus, Anticostia, Rectograptus, Paraorthograptus, Phormograptus, Styracograptus and Appendispinograptus) also reappear in the uppermost part of the Vinini Creek section, well into the persculptus Biozone (which is topped by a prominent <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>unconformity).</b> These occurrences record a complex extinction pattern among graptolites that involved a radical but extended ecological reorganization rather than a synchronous global collapse of the pre-glacial ecosystem.

This is taken as support for the idea that glacio-eustacy exercised a major control on the depositional pattern in shallow-water successions during Hirnantian time.

50|$|Most {{sedimentation}} in the Adare Basin {{took place}} after the second extensional event. Sedimentation offshore Antarctica is primarily driven by pelagic settling, down-slope gravity flows, and across-slope current flows driven by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The continental slope in the Adare Basin is very steep and sinuous, causing turbidite channels to be common. Several Antarctic deep water currents are also responsible for depositing large amounts of sediment into the basin. Early Miocene tectonic faulting caused <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>unconformities</b> within the Adare Basin. These unconformities separate the deposition pattern into three characteristically unique domains of stratigraphic units in the Adare Basin. These are the West, East, and Center units, with the Center unit being inside the Adare Trough and along the spreading axis. Seismic transects reveal faster seismic velocities, deeper in the Center the West units of the basin, while faster velocities are detected shallower to the northeast of the trough in the East unit. This indicates that the stacked layers of sediment are thicker above the spreading axis than above the flanks of the trough.|$|R

The data show parallel, glacially induced seafloor scours, or grooves, and intervening ridges that reach widths of 1000 m (rim to rim) {{and as much as}} 40 m relief. Following previous authors, we refer to these features as “megascale glacial lineations (MSGLs). ” Additional support for ice grounding is apparent from <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>unconformities,</b> interpreted to have been caused by ice-induced erosion. Most likely, the observed sea-floor features represent evidence for massive ice-shelf grounding. The general ESE/WNW direction of the MSGLs, together with sediment, evidently bulldozed off the Chukchi Plateau, that is mapped on the western (Siberian) side of the plateau, suggests ice flow from the Canada Basin side of Chukchi Borderland. Two separate generations of glacially derived MSGLs are identified on the Chukchi Borderland from the Healy geophysical data.

40|$|AbstractBased on {{comprehensive}} {{analyses of}} seismic and log data, this {{study indicates that}} mainly four widespread angular to minor angular unconformities (Tg 8, Tg 51, Tg 5 and Tg 3) were formed during the Paleozoic. Through the interpretation of structural unconformities, calculation of eroded thickness, correction of palaeo-water depth and compaction and compilation of the Early Paleozoic structural maps, the Early Paleozoic slope break belt (geomorphologic unit) of the Tarim Basin is subdivided into uplift area, subaqueous uplift area, rift slope break belt, flexure slope break belt (slope belt), depression area and deep basin area. Palaeogeomorphology of the Cambrian-Early Ordovician was approximately in EW trend within which three tectonic units including the Tabei Palaeo-uplift, the northern Depressional Belt and the southern Palaeo-uplift developed respectively and are grouped into two slope break systems namely as the Tabei Palaeo-uplift and the southern Palaeo-uplift. These tectonic units obviously control the deposition of isolated platform, open platform, restricted platform and deep basin. Influenced by extrusion in the Mid-Late Ordovician, the southern and northern subaqueous uplifts gradually elevated and then were eroded. Resultantly two slope break systems developed, namely as the northern and central Palaeo-uplifts which obviously controlled the deposition of provenance area, isolated platform, mixed continental shelf, slope and basin facies. The intensive extrusion of the Mid-Late Ordovician leads to significant tectonic deformation of the Tarim Basin: large area of uplifting and erosion and development of EW trending anticline and syncline. Deposition of shore, tidal flat, delta, shallow marine clastics and deep marine facies is obviously controlled by the Tabei, the southern and the Tadong Palaeo-uplifts. Slope break systems control development of <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>unconformity</b> and thus truncation and onlap unconformity zones become favorable areas in a palaeo-uplift and at a palaeo-slope belt for forming important unconformity traps; Whereas slope (slope break) belt along a palaeo-uplift margin is a geomorphologic unit where high-energy sedimentary facies widely develops, such as reef, oolitic sandy clastics or bioclastic limestone beach bar facies, thus litho-structural composite hydrocarbon accumulations usually develop when tectonic condition is suitable. In addition, large-scale palaeo-uplifts are the most favourable areas for hydrocarbon accumulation developmen...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the sedimentological/stratigraphic and {{structural}} evolution of the sedimentary rocks {{that occur in the}} NW continental border of the Potiguar Basin. These rocks are well exposed along coastal cliffs between the localities of Lagoa do Mato and Icapuí, Ceará State (NE Brazil). The sedimentological/stratigraphic study involved, at the outcrop scale, detailed facies descriptions, profile mapping of the vertical succession of different beds, and columnar sections displaying inferred lateral relationships. The approach was complemented by granulometric and petrographic analyses, including the characterization of heavy mineral assemblages. The data set allowed to recognize two kinds of lithological units, a carbonate one of very restricted occurrence {{at the base of the}} cliffs, and three younger, distinct siliciclastic units, that predominate along the cliffs, in vertical and lateral extent. The carbonate rocks were correlated to the late Cretaceous Jandaíra Formation, which is covered by the siliciclastic Barreiras Formation. The Barreiras Formation occurs in two distinct structural settings, the usual one with nondeformed, subhorizontal strata, or as tilted beds, affected by strong deformation. Two lithofacies were recognized, vertically arranged or in fault contacts. The lower facies is characterized by silty-argillaceous sandstones with low-angle cross bedding; the upper facies comprises medium to coarse grained sandstones, with conglomeratic layers. The Tibau Formation (medium to coarse-grained sandstones with argillite intercalations) occurs at the NW side of the studied area, laterally interlayered with the Barreiras Formation. Eolic sediments correlated to the Potengi Formation overly the former units, either displaying an angular unconformity, or simply an erosional contact (<b>stratigraphic</b> <b>unconformity).</b> Outstanding structural features, identified in the Barreiras Formation, led to characterize a neocenozoic stress field, which generated faults and folds and/or reactivated older structures in the subjacent late cretaceous (to paleogene, in the offshore basin) section. The structures recognized in the Barreiras Formation comprise two distinct assemblages, namely a main extensional deformation between the localities of Ponta Grossa and Redonda, and a contractional style (succeeded by oblique extensional structures) at Vila Nova. In the first case, the structural assemblage is dominated by N-S (N± 20 °Az) steep to gently-dipping extensional faults, displaying a domino-style or listric geometry with associated roll-over structures. This deformation pattern is explained by an E-W/WNW extension, contemporaneous with deposition of the upper facies of the Barreiras Formation, during the time interval Miocene to Pleistocene. Strong rotation of blocks and faults generated low-angle distensional faults and, locally, subvertical bedding, allowing to estimate very high strain states, with extension estimates varying between 40 % up to 200 %. Numerous detachment zones, parallel to bedding, help to acommodate this intense deformation. The detachment surfaces and a large number of faults display mesoscopic features analoguous to the ones of ductile shear zones, with development of S-C fabrics, shear bands, sigmoidal clasts and others, pointing to a hydroplastic deformation regime in these cases. Local occurrences of the Jandaíra limestone are controled by extensional faults that exhume the pre-Barreiras section, including an earlier event with N-S extension. Finally, WNWtrending extensional shear zones and faults are compatible with the Holocene stress field along the present continental margin. In the Vila Nova region, close to Icapuí, gentle normal folds with fold hinges shallowly pluging to SSW affect the lower facies of the Barreiras Formation, displaying an incipient dissolution cleavage associated with an extension lineation at high rake (a S>L fabric). Deposition of the upper facies siliciclastics is controlled by pull-apart graben structures, bordered by N-NE-trending sinistral-normal shear zones and faults, characterizing an structural inversion. Microstructures are compatible with tectonic deformation of the sedimentary pile, burried at shallow depths. The observed features point to high pore fluid pressures during deformation of the sediments, producing hydroplastic structures through mechanisms of granular flow. Such structures are overprinted by microfractures and microfaults (an essentially brittle regime), tracking the change to microfracturing and frictional shear mechanisms accompanying progressive dewatering and sediment lithification. Correlation of the structures observed at the surface with those present at depth was tested through geophysical data (Ground Penetrating Radar, seismics and a magnetic map). EW and NE-trending lineaments are observed in the magnetic map. The seismic sections display several examples of positive flower structures which affect the base of the cretaceous sediments; at higher stratigraphic levels, normal components/slips are compatible with the negative structural inversion characterized at the surface. Such correlations assisted in proposing a structural model compatible with the regional tectonic framework. The strong neogenepleistocene deformation is necessarily propagated in the subsurface, affecting the late cretaceous section (Açu and Jandaíra formations), wich host the hydrocarbon reservoirs in this portion of the Potiguar Basin. The proposed structural model is related to the dextral transcurrent/transform deformation along the Equatorial Margin, associated with transpressive terminations of E-W fault zones, or at their intersections with NE-trending lineaments, such as the Ponta Grossa-Fazenda Belém one (the LPGFB, itself controlled by a Brasiliano-age strike-slip shear zone). In a first step (and possibly during the late Cretaceous to Paleogene), this lineament was activated under a sinistral transpressional regime (antithetic to the main dextral deformation in the E-W zones), giving way to the folds in the lower facies of the Barreiras Formation, as well as the positive flower structures mapped through the seismic sections, at depth. This stage was succeeded (or was penecontemporaneous) by the extensional structures related to a (also sinistral) transtensional movement stage, associated to volcanism (Macau, Messejana) and thermal doming processes during the Neogene-Pleistocene time interval. This structural model has direct implications to hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation activities at this sector of the Potiguar Basin and its offshore continuation. The structure of the reservoirs at depth (Açu Formation sandstones of the post-rift section) may be controlled (or at least, strongly influenced) by the deformation geometry and kinematics characterized at the surface. In addition, the deformation event recognized in the Barreiras Formation has an age close to the one postulated for the oil maturation and migration in the basin, between the Oligocene to the Miocene. In this way, the described structural cenario represents a valid model to understand the conditions of hydrocarbon transport and acummulation through space openings, trap formation and destruction. This model is potentially applicable to the NW region of the Potiguar Basin and other sectors with a similar structural setting, along the brazilian Equatorial Atlantic MarginEsta tese contempla a caracterização sedimentológica/litoestratigráfica e estrutural das rochas sedimentares na porção continental NW da Bacia Potiguar, e que afloram em falésias no setor litorâneo compreendido entre as localidades de Lagoa do Mato e Icapuí, Ceará (NE do Brasil). Os estudos sedimentológicos /estratigráficos das unidades mapeadas, em escala de afloramento, envolveram descrições faciológicas, levantamento de perfis com empilhamento vertical das diferentes camadas, e a construção de seções colunares caracterizando as relações laterais observadas. Ainda foram realizados estudos granulométricos e petrográficos, bem como a identificação das assembléias de minerais pesados. O conjunto desses dados permitiu identificar dois grupos de litologias, representados por uma unidade carbonática, que ocorre de forma restrita na base das falésias, e três unidades siliciclásticas, que predominam lateral e verticalmente, nas falésias. As rochas carbonáticas, correlacionadas à Formação Jandaíra, do Cretáceo superior, são capeadas pelas rochas siliciclásticas da Formação Barreiras. A Formação Barreiras ocorre em dois contextos estruturais distintos, sob a forma de estratos horizontalizados e não deformados, a situação mais usual, ou com camadas basculadas e afetadas por forte deformação. Foram individualizadas duas litofácies, dispostas verticalmente em contatos normais, ou por falhas. A denominada fácies inferior é composta por arenitos síltico-argilosos com estratificação cruzada de baixo ângulo; a fácies superior é caracterizada por arenitos médios a grossos, maciços, com intercalações conglomeráticas. No extremo NW da área ocorre uma segunda unidade, a Formação Tibau (arenitos médios a grossos com intercalações de argilitos), que está lateralmente interdigitada com a Formação Barreiras. Finalmente, no topo das unidades anteriores ocorrem sedimentos eólicos correlacionados à Formação Potengi. A discordância na base desta última unidade (a Formação Potengi) torna-se nítida quando os estratos sotopostos estão basculados e falhados (discordância angular). Para os demais casos, o contato é erosional (discordância estratigráfica). Na área estudada, chamam atenção as feições estruturais identificadas na Formação Barreiras, que permitem caracterizar o campo de tensões neocenozóico, que gerou falhas e dobras e/ou reativou estruturas mais antigas na seção neocretácica (a paleógena, no setor offshore da bacia) subjacente. As feições estruturais identificadas nas rochas da Formação Barreiras permitem distinguir duas situações distintas, caracterizadas por uma deformação principal distensional, entre as localidades de Ponta Grossa e Redonda, e um estilo contracional (sucedido por estruturas distensionais oblíquas), em Vila Nova. No primeiro caso, as feições observadas envolvem falhas distensionais de direção N-S (N± 20 °Az), com mergulhos de alto a baixo ângulo. Em geral possuem arranjo em dominó ou geometria lístrica com estruturas roll-over associadas. Este padrão deformacional pode ser explicado por uma distensão E-W/WNW, contemporânea à deposição da fácies superior da Formação Barreiras, no intervalo Mioceno-Pleistoceno. A pronunciada rotação de blocos e falhas delimitantes, gerando falhas distensionais de baixo ângulo e, localmente, verticalização do acamamento, traduz a forte magnitude deste evento, com estimativas que variam de 40 % até 200 % de distensão. São freqüentes as zonas de descolamento paralelas ao acamamento, que permitem acomodar a intensa deformação observada. As superfícies de descolamento e boa parte das falhas exibem feições mesoscópicas análogas às de zonas de cisalhamento dúctil, com desenvolvimento de superfícies S-C, shear bands, clastos sigmoidais e outras, caracterizando no caso um regime de deformação hidroplástico. As ocorrências localizadas do Calcário Jandaíra são condicionadas por falhas distensionais que exumam a seção pré-Barreiras, incluindo um evento precoce com distensão N-S. Finalmente, são observadas zonas de cisalhamento e falhas distensionais com direção WNW, tardias, explicadas por um evento compatível com o campo de tensões holocênico, neste setor da margem continental. Na região de Vila Nova, próximo a Icapuí, observam-se dobras suaves afetando a fácies inferior da Formação Barreiras, com eixos mergulhando para SSW, planos incipientes de clivagem de dissolução e uma lineação de estiramento de alto rake, compondo um fabric S>L. A deposição dos siliciclásticos da fácies superior é controlada por estruturas de graben pullapart, delimitados por falhas e zonas de cisalhamento sinistrais-normais, com direção N-NE, caracterizando uma inversão estrutural. Os aspectos microestuturais são compatíveis com deformação tectônica em um contexto de soterramento raso do pacote sedimentar. As feições identificadas sugerem altas pressões de fluidos nos poros dos sedimentos, gerando microestruturas de caráter hidroplástico, indicativos da atuação do mecanismo de fluxo granular. Tais estruturas são superpostas por microfraturas e microfalhas (caráter mais frágil), o que denota a passagem para mecanismos de microfraturamento e deslizamento friccional, com a progressiva desidratação e litificação dos sedimentos. A correlação das estruturas observadas em superfície com aquelas presentes em subsuperfície foi realizada a partir de dados geofísicos (Ground Penetrating Radar, sísmica e mapa magnético). Devem ser destacados os lineamentos E-W e NE, observados no mapa magnético e, nas seções sísmicas, os vários exemplos de estruturas em flor positiva, que afetam a base da seção neocretácea; em níveis superiores, também são discerníveis rejeitos/componentes normais, o que seria compatível com a inversão negativa caracterizada em superfície. Tais correlações auxiliaram na proposição de um modelo estrutural compatível com o arcabouço tectônico regional. A deformação neógena-pleistocênica, de grande magnitude, está necessariamente propagada em subsuperfície afetando, neste caso, a seção neocretácea (formações Açu e Jandaíra), hospedeira dos reservatórios de hidrocarbonetos neste setor da Bacia Potiguar. O modelo estrutural proposto foi relacionado à deformação transcorrente/transformante dextral da Margem Equatorial, associada com terminações em transpressão de zonas E-W, ou na interseção destas com zonas NE, a exemplo do Lineamento Ponta Grossa-Fazenda Belém (o LPGFB, controlado por uma zona de cisalhamento transcorrente, de idade brasiliana). Numa primeira etapa (e possivelmente no Cretáceo superior e Paleógeno), este lineamento funcionou em regime transpressional sinistral (antitético à deformação dextral nas zonas E-W), e pode ter gerado as dobras na fácies inferior da Formação Barreiras, bem como as estruturas em flor positiva em subsuperfície. Este estágio foi sucedido (ou foi penecontemporâneo) pelas estruturas distensionais que sugerem uma etapa de movimentação transtracional (também sinistral) associada a processos de vulcanismo (Macau, Messejana) e domeamento térmico, no intervalo Neógeno-Pleistoceno. Este modelo estrutural tem implicações diretas nas atividades de exploração e de explotação de hidrocarbonetos neste setor da Bacia Potiguar e em sua extensão offshore. A estruturação dos reservatórios em subsuperfície (arenitos da Formação Açu, da sequência pósrifte) pode estar condicionada (ou pelo menos, fortemente influenciada) pela geometria e cinemática da deformação, caracterizada em superfície. Em adição, o evento deformacional registrado na Formação Barreiras tem idade próxima à da janela de maturação e migração de óleo na bacia, estimada entre o Oligoceno e o Mioceno. Desta forma, o cenário estrutural descrito representa um modelo válido para entender as condições de transporte e aprisionamento de hidrocarbonetos, promovendo abertura de espaços, formação e destruição de trapas. Este modelo é potencialmente aplicável à região NW da Bacia Potiguar e a setores com contexto estrutural semelhante, ao longo da Margem Equatorial Atlântica brasileir...|$|E

Preliminary {{analysis of the}} data received has disclosed two potentially important northwest-trending systems of linear features within the Northern California Coast Ranges. A third system, which trends northeast, can be traced with great uncertainty across the alluviated part of the Sacramento Valley and into the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. These linear features may represent fault systems or zones of shearing. Of interest, although not yet verified, is the observation that some of the mercury concentrations and some of the geothermally active areas of California may be located at the intersection of the Central and the Valley Systems. One, perhaps two, <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>unconformities</b> within the Late Mesozoic sedimentary rocks were detected during preliminary examination of the imagery; however, more analysis is necessary in order to verify this preliminary interpretation.

This study also quantifies liquid/gas hydrocarbon generation, migration and seepage dynamics through the post-rift history of the basin. The interpretation of seismic data reveals two mega-sequences: Cretaceous and Cenozoic that are subdivided by major <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>unconformities</b> into 5 and 2 sub-units, respectively. The basin is also divided into 2 structural domains: 1. an extensional domain characterized by basinward dipping listric normal faults rooted at the Cenomanian/Turonian level identified between 500 to 1500 m of present-day depth, 2. a compressional domain that accommodates the up-dip extension on the lower slope, and which is characterized by landward dipping thrust faults. One hundred and thirteen observed gas chimneys are identified and classified into stratigraphically-controlled (sa-c) and structurally-controlled (s-c) chimneys. The ratio of s-c versus s-ac chimneys is estimated as 2 : 5, which suggest a strong stratigraphic control on natural gas leakage. The chimneys either terminate at the seafloor where active leaking gas is manifested by pockmarks, or are sealed within the Miocene (14 Ma) sequence as paleo-pockmarks. The s-c chimneys are located along the normal faults in the extensional domain, and terminate as seafloor mounds up to 1500 m in diameter and with heights between 10 to 50 m...|$|R

The seaward flank of this swell or broad monocline between the interior Araripe and coastal Potiguar basins was eroded, and currently forms a deeply embayed plain bordered by a semi-circular, north-facing erosional escarpment. The post-Cenomanian uplift caused an inversion of the Cretaceous basins and generated a landscape in which the most elevated landforms correspond either to resistant Mesozoic sedimentary caprock, or to eroded stumps of syn-rift Cretaceous footwall uplands. Denudation in the last 90 My never exceeded mean rates of 10 m·My– 1 and exhumed a number of Cretaceous <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>unconformities.</b> As a result, some topographic surfaces at low elevations are effectively Mesozoic land surfaces that became re-exposed in Cenozoic times. The Neogene Barreiras Formation forms a continuous and mostly clastic apron near the coast. It testifies to the last peak of erosion in the hinterland and coincided with the onset of more arid climates at ~ 13 Ma or earlier. The semi-circular escarpment is not directly related to the initial breakup rift flanks, which had been mostly eroded before the end of the Mesozoic, but the cause and exact timing of post-Cenomanian crustal upwarping are poorly constrained. It could perhaps have been a flexural response of the low-rigidity lithosphere to sediment loads on the margin, and thus a slowly ongoing process since the late Cretaceous. Uplift could instead be the consequence of a more discrete dynamic event related either to Oligocene magmatism in the region, or to continental-scale far-field stresses determined by Andean convergence...|$|R
40|$|The Bradano Trough area, {{included}} in the watershed of Venosa River, passed from subsidence to regional tectonic uplift with the sedimentation of the Irsina Conglomerate Formation. This period (Middle Pleistocene in age), which was characterized by an alternance of erosional and depositional phases developed {{on a series of}} direct faults with a strike-slip component (direction N 110 °± 5 °, N 130 ° and east,west) and formed the Venosa Basin palaeovalley. The first erosive phase {{led to the formation of}} three alluvial terraces (Ciciriello, Pezza della Breccia e Masseria Impiso Subsynthem) which can be grouped into the Sant'Angelo Synthem. The following depositional event was characterized by the emplacement of by alluvial and lacustrine deposits consisting of conglomerate, mudstone and tuff, which can be grouped into three synthems bounded by <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>unconformities.</b> Sediment composition is mainly volcanic detritus with minor layers of primary volcanic deposits (pyroclastic flow and fall deposits) which can be correlated with the Foggianello, Barile and Melfi Synthem, of Monte Vulture volcano. The three epiclastic units and the Sant'Angelo Synthem have been grouped into the Monte Vulture Supersynthem (from 687 ± 8 ky to 530 ± 22 ky in age). Analysis of the sedimentary facies reveals that the Foggianello Synthem formed in a depositional system of gravelly braided plains and the Barile Synthem formed in small lake basins connected with high sinuosity channels. After the Melfi Synthem sedimentation, on the north-western border of the Venosa Basin, sub-vertical direct faults formed (direction N 90 °± 5 ° and N 103 °± 2 °). Concurrently a new erosional phase, connected with three depositional episodes, occurred. It led to the formation of alluvial deposits that are linked to three terraced stages of fluvial overcutting. Two out of the three units (Li Scafoni and Toppo di Maggio Subsynthem) are {{included in}} the Torrente Olivento Synthem and the other one in the Caperroni Synthem. The two synthems are associated with the Monticchio Supersynthem.

40|$|Throughout {{exploration}} Block 2 of the Orange Basin offshore the South African continental margin, different {{natural gas}} leakage features {{and the relationship}} between natural gas leakage with structural and stratigraphic elements were studied. This study also quantifies liquid/gas hydrocarbon generation, migration and seepage dynamics through the post-rift history of the basin. The interpretation of seismic data reveals two mega-sequences: Cretaceous and Cenozoic that are subdivided by major <b>stratigraphic</b> <b>unconformities</b> into 5 and 2 sub-units, respectively. The basin is also divided into 2 structural domains: 1. an extensional domain characterized by basinward dipping listric normal faults rooted at the Cenomanian/Turonian level identified between 500 to 1500 m of present-day depth, 2. a compressional domain that accommodates the up-dip extension on the lower slope, and which is characterized by landward dipping thrust faults. One hundred and thirteen observed gas chimneys are identified and classified into. stratigraphically-controlled (sa-c) and structurally-controlled (s-c) chimneys. The ratio of s-c versus s-ac chimneys is estimated as 2 : 5, which suggest a strong stratigraphic control on natural gas leakage. The chimneys either terminate at the seafloor where active leaking gas is manifested by pockmarks, or are sealed within the Miocene (14 Ma) sequence as paleo-pockmarks. The s-c chimneys are located along the normal faults in the extensional domain, and terminate as seafloor mounds up to 1500 m in diameter and with heights between 10 to 50 m. The sa-c pockmarks range between 100 to 400 m in diameter, and are linked to stratigraphic onlaps and pinch-outs within the Aptian sequence. Several giant chimneys, with diameters of more than 7 km, are also identified. At least one of these displays apparent internal gravitational collap. se structures. Bright spots indicative of gas presence within these large chimneys were identified, but {{there is no evidence of}} acoustic turbidity or seismic pull-downs within these large structures. This suggests the giant chimneys are inactive paleo-gas-escape structures. Modelling suggests that gas from the lower Aptian and the Barremian source rocks migrates laterally-updip to the proximal parts of the basin where it accumulates beneath the Cenomanian/Turonian sequence that acts as a regional seal. Across the shelf-break and the upper slope, chimneys and pockmarks are fed from younger Cenomanian/Turonian source rocks. The migration model also indicates that fluids are about 24 times more likely to flow out of the study area than to be preserved within it. Since methane gas escaping across the sea floor into the exosphere (combined hydrosphere and atmosphere) may contribute to Earth s climate fluctuations, and because escaping gas must have been cut off when at least half of identified s-c chimneys were sealed within the Mioeene. sequenee, deerease of gas escape along the southern African continental margin may have to be factored into global Neogene cooling models...|$|R
40|$|The Cambrian Tamdroust and Bab n’Ali Volcanic Complexes {{represent}} two magmatic episodes {{developed in}} the latest Ediacaran–Cambrian Atlas Rift of Morocco. Their rifting pulses were accompanied by accumulation of volcanosedimentary edifices (dominated by effusive lava flows in the former and explosive acidic aprons in the latter) associated with active tilting and uplift. Sealing of their peneplaned horst-and-graben palaeotopographies led to the onset of distinct onlapping geometries and angular discordances capping eroded basements ranging from the Ediacaran Ouarzazate Supergroup to the Cambrian Asrir Formation. Previous interpretations of these discordances as pull-apart or compressive events are revised here and reinterpreted in an extensional (rifting) context associated with active volcanism. The record of erosive <b>unconformities,</b> <b>stratigraphic</b> gaps, condensed beds and onlapping patterns across the traditional “lower–middle Cambrian” (or Cambrian Series 2 – 3) transition of the Atlas Rift {{must be taken into}} consideration for global chronostratigraphic correlation based on their trilobite content...|$|R

Geologic characters and spatial distributions of five of these unconformities, which have resulted from different geological processes, have been studied.

The unconformities beneath the Gaoyuzhuang and the Yangzhuang formations {{are considered to be}} the consequence of regional eustatic fluctuations, leading to the exposure of highlands in passive margins during low sea-level stands and transgressive deposition on coastal regions during high sea-level stands. The unconformity atop the Tieling Formation might be caused by uplift due to contractional deformation in a back-arc setting, whereas the uplift after the deposition of the Xiamaling Formation might be attributed to a continental collision event. It is assumed that the occurrences of these unconformities in the Mesoproterozoic successions in the northern margin of the North China Block had a close bearing on the assemblage and breakup of the Columbia and Rodinia supercontinents...|$|R
40|$|Sequence stratigraphic {{studies of}} the Triassic through Paleogene {{carbonate}} successions of platform, slope and basin in western Sicily (Palermo and Termini Imerese Mountains) have identified a sedimentary cyclicity mostly caused by relative oscillations of sea level. The stratigraphic successions of the Imerese and Panormide palaeogeographic domains of the southern Tethyan continental margin were studied with physical-stratigraphy and facies analysis to reconstruct the sedimentary evolution of this platform-to-basin system. The Imerese Basin {{is characterized by a}} carbonate and siliceous-calcareous succession, 1200 - 1400 m thick, Late Triassic to Eocene in age. The strata display a typical example of a carbonate platform margin, characterized by resedimented facies with progradational stacking patterns. The Panormide Carbonate Platform is characterized by a carbonate succession, 1000 - 1200 m thick, Late Triassic to Late Eocene, mostly consisting of shallow-water facies with periodic subaerial exposure. The cyclic arrangement has been obtained by the study of the <b>stratigraphic</b> signatures (<b>unconformities,</b> facies sequences, erosional surfaces and stratal geometries) found in the slope successions. The recognized pattern has been compared with coeval facies of the shelf. This correlation provided evidence of sedimentary evolution, influenced by progradation and backstepping of the shelf deposits. The stratigraphic architecture of the platform-to-basin system is characterized by four major transgressive/regressive cycles during the late Triassic to late Eocene. These cycles, framed in a chronostratigraphic chart, allows the correlation of the investigated shelf-to-basin system with the geological evolution of the African continental margin during the Mesozoic, showing tectono-eustatic cycles. The first cycle, encompassing the late Triassic to early Jurassic, appears {{to be related to the}} late syn-rift stage of the continental margin evolution.

New structural data, regarding both Epiligurian and Early Pliocene deposits, show strong evidences of the existence of synsedimentary tectonics. Six depositional sequences, separated by erosional surfaces, have been recognized inside Epiligurian deposits and they were controlled by different tectonic phases. During these phases the movement of the Val Marecchia sheet took place by thrust faults set in imbricated slices along one or more surfaces: Apenninic compressional regime (from SW to NE) caused this pattern and modelled "autochthonous" sequence in folds and slices overthrusted to NE. A deep structural depression, transversal to the Apenninic chain, probably related to wrench-fault tectonics (Grosseto-Marecchia line) occurred since Tortonian and controlled the sedimentation of the Umbro-Marchean-Romagna sequence until Early Pliocene (Globorotalia puncticulata Zone). A palaeogeographic reconstruction of this area during Middle Miocene-Early Pliocene is proposed; Apenninic compressional regime played two different roles {{in the construction of the}} structural elements of the Val Marecchia area. Structural "autochthonous" highs became evident since Middle-Late Miocene and controlled rate and dynamics of the "substratum" of the Val Marecchia sheet.

40|$|The topmost {{part of the}} Oxfordian limestones, {{building}} the Zakrzówek Horst in Kraków, is featured by a network of minute fissures, filled with Upper Cretaceous limestones. Fissures are dominantly subhorizontal, anastomosing and polygonal in plane. They are filled with white limestones representing mostly foraminiferal- calcisphere wackestones, with subordinate amount of quartz pebbles and fragments of stromatolite coming from the latest Turonian-?Early Coniacian conglomerate overlying Oxfordian basement. The fissures are seismically- induced injection dykes. In contrast to gravitationally-filled neptunian dykes the recognised injection dykes were filled by overpressured soft sediments. Foraminifera within some dykes are abundant, and dominated by plankto- nic forms, which indicate the Early/Late Campanian age (Globotruncana ventricosa and Globotruncanita calcarata zones) of the filling, and hence date also the synsedimentary tectonics. Abundant and diversified keeled globo- truncanids in the Campanian of the Kraków region are recognised for the first time. Other important findings at the studied section include karstic cavities featuring {{the surface of the}} Oxfordian bedrock filled with conglomerates of the latest Turonian-?Early Coniacian age based on foraminifera and nannoplankton, and lack of Santonian deposits, which elsewhere are common in the Upper Cretaceous sequences in the Kraków region. The discovered Campanian dykes provide new evidence for the Late Cretaceous tectonic activity on the Kraków Swell related to the Subhercynian tectonism, which resulted among others in <b>stratigraphic</b> hiatuses and <b>unconformities</b> characte- ristic of the Turonian-Santonian interval of this area...|$|R
40|$|Cenozoic planktonic foraminiferal biostratigraphy at DSDP-IPOD Leg 80 sites {{documents}} {{the existence of}} regionwide stratigraphic gaps in the Paleocene and middle Miocene. Episodes of carbonate dissolution also occurred during the Paleocene at several sites, particularly at Site 549, where destruction of foraminiferal tests may obscure evidence of an unconformity. The middle Miocene hiatus is apparent at each site where Neogene sediments were continuously cored. Upper Miocene sediments at Site 550 (the only abyssal site) are characterized by moderate to extensive dissolution of planktonic foraminifers, but they contain abundant specimens of Bolboforma that mark this stratigraphic interval (von Daniels and Spiegler, 1974, doi: 10. 1007 /BF 02986990; Roegl, 1976, doi: 10. 2973 /dsdp. proc. 35. 133. 1976; Murray, 1979, doi: 10. 2973 /dsdp. proc. 48. 116. 1979; Müller et al., 1985, doi: 10. 2973 /dsdp. proc. 80. 117. 1985). Although foraminiferal evidence is not conclusive, nannofossils indicate a widespread Oligocene unconformity (Müller, 1985). Several oceanographic factors, not just simple sea-level change, probably interacted to produce these regional unconformities. There are also dramatic differences in the Cenozoic sedimentary record among Leg 80 sites, indicating that each has had a distinct geologic history. The thickness of the Cenozoic section varies from 100 m at Site 551 to 471 m at Site 548. The thickness of individual chronostratigraphic units also varies, as do the number and <b>stratigraphic</b> position of <b>unconformities</b> other than those mentioned. Differences in the stratigraphic record from site to site across the continental slope result from (1) location in separate half-graben structures, (2) varying location across the developing margin, and (3) difference in position relative to the seaward edge of the enclosing half-graben.

40|$|The Bahia Basin {{is located}} in the NW corner of South America where a complex history of subduction, {{accretion}} and transpression is on-going since Cretaceous times. The Bahia Basin is located just offshore from major strike-slip fault systems that affect northern Colombia and lies behind the toe of the modern accretionary prism, where the Caribbean Plate is being subducted obliquely beneath South America. This study uses a high quality 3 D-PSTM seismic volume, regional 2 D seismic reflection lines, and well data, to investigate the basin formation and evolution in an oblique subduction setting. Standard 3 D seismic mapping of key seismic <b>stratigraphic</b> surfaces (regional <b>unconformities)</b> and faults is used to identify the basin architecture and geological framework. The main surface mapped in the area is the upper Miocene to lower Pliocene unconformity, which highlights the presence of a young, deep, narrow basin trending NE-SW, bounded to the NW by a major fault: the Bahia Fault. This fault shows an initial phase of normal displacement with later inversion along its segments. To understand the geological evolution between pre- and post- late Miocene times, structures below and above the unconformity were mapped. In addition, time-thickness maps were calculated to assess the formation and migration of depocentres, as well as the growth of compression-related structures. The interpretation of the regional grid of 2 D seismic reflection lines, extending from the toe of the accretionary prism to the shelf, document the structural styles of the area. These are the South Caribbean accretionary prism, an extensional/strike-slip zone {{to the rear of the}} prism and the mobile shale prevalent throughout the area. Detailed interpretation of 3 D seismic reflection data demonstrates that prior to the late Miocene the Bahia Basin formed as a transtensional basin within a right-lateral shear zone. During this opening stage, areas within the basin acted as independent blocks bounded by strike-slip faults. These blocks were internally deformed by small extensional faults, whose geometry and distribution suggest clockwise, vertical-axis block rotation within the shear zone. Subsequently, the closing stage of the basin during Plio-Pleistocene times is discussed. The main structural style in this phase of basin evolution is basin inversion together with concomitant extension, all suggesting a transpressional setting. Moreover, this also suggests the occurrence of a complex interaction with major-onshore strike-slip fault systems, where the relative expulsion of the Maracaibo Block might induce the local onset of transpression in the Bahia Basin during Pliocene times, resulting in basin inversion, and ultimate closure of the basin. This study concludes that the formation and evolution of the Bahia Basin can be understood in the context of oblique subduction, where localised shale tectonics has also influenced the basin evolution, and extends evidence for strike-slip deformation along the southern boundary of the Caribbean plate further westward than previously documented.

40|$|More than 10 000 km of {{high-resolution}} seismic profiles permit {{detailed study}} of six fourth-order seismic stratigraphic sequences deposited during the last million years on the Latium continental shelf, Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy. Sedimentation occurred on a relatively young passive margin characterized by a narrow and relatively steep shelf where sediment storage capacity in adjacent subaerial basins was limited. The Late Pleistocene deposits are locally tilted and eroded to different levels along the sea-floor so that carefully placed seafloor gravity cores help constrain {{the age of the}} seismic sequences by the dating of microfauna. Correlation with a deep well located on the coast constraints the basal third-order sequence boundary on the shelf. The seismic and a limited core database make it possible to: (1) detail variability in the architecture, stratal patterns and bounding surfaces of the sequences across the shelf and adjacent continental slope; (2) define a hierarchy of seismic units and their bounding surfaces; (3) make a correlation with the published oxygen-isotope curves; (4) develop a detailed stratigraphic framework and model for the fourth-order sequences deposited during last 0. 8 Ma; (5) define the effects of the long-lasting eustatic falls on margin sedimentation; (6) recognize volumetric partitioning of sedimentation between systems tracts. The seismo-stratigraphic expression of the third- and fourth-order sequence boundaries varies greatly from the inner to the outer part of the margin. Where subsidence allowed the preservation of lowstand systems tract (LST) deposits on the shelf, they are bounded by erosional unconformities interpreted to reflect fourth-order glacioeustatically-driven cycles. Relatively thin (< 10 m) lens-shaped bodies mark the transition from the unconformities to their correlative conformities and are interpreted to have been deposited during the eustatic minimum. The deposits bounded between correlative conformities show an upward loss in acoustic transparency thought to indicate upward-coarsening and regression within the sequences. Downdip on the continental slope, sequence boundaries are concordant surfaces correlative with unconformities on the shelf. However, these surfaces are locally scoured by channellized features, interpreted to record slope erosion related to the discharge of river bedload during lowstands. There is marked asymmetry and volumetric partitioning between systems tracts; most of the Late Quaternary deposits that comprise the Latium continental margin are interpreted to have formed during forced regression and lowstand. Offshore of the northern and central Latium shelves forced regressive and lowstand deposits account for some 1000 km 3 of shelf and slope deposition during the last eustatic cycle. In contrast, sediments attributed to the transgressive and highstand systems tracts account for approximately 37 km 3. High-frequency, high-amplitude asymmetric sea-level changes driven mainly by glacioeustasy are interpreted to have controlled deposition. Following classic three-fold sequence <b>stratigraphic</b> models, the <b>unconformities</b> created by shelf subaerial exposure and erosion represent sequence boundaries at the base of depositional sequences. However, if as is the case of the Latium margin during the Late Pleistocene, where a continental margin is formed almost exclusively of forced regressive deposits, each sequence basal boundary will paradoxically be situated above the forced regressive deposits that are deposited as the subaerial exposure surface forms, i. e. above the whole of its own depositional sequence. In this respect, the incorporation of a fourth forced regressive or falling stage systems tracts specific to times of base-level fall would help avoid this inconsistency...|$|R
40|$|Paleogeography - Te kuiti group (Map 1 - 13) {{in print}} copyThe Late Eocene - Oligocene Te Kuiti Group crops out {{extensively}} in central-western North Island between Port Waikato and Awakino, providing a useful window for examination of a broadly transgressive shelfal to upper bathyal mixed carbonate-siliciclastic basin fill succession. The group accumulated during initiation of Cenozoic glaciations on Antarctica when {{there may have}} been associated eustatic changes in sea- level changes, and during the initiation of the Australia-Pacific plate boundary through the New Zealand region, which might also have caused relative changes in sea level in the Waikato Basin. As part of this study Te Kuiti lithostratigraphy in central-western North Island has been reviewed and rationalized. Special emphasis has been given to correlation of the significant <b>stratigraphic</b> discontinuities (erosional <b>unconformities,</b> depositional hiatuses) between units. Combined with a review of the foraminiferal biostratigraphy and new Sr isotope ages for the group, lithologically diverse formations have been able to be correlated across and along the outcrop belt. In the revised stratigraphic scheme, seven formations and 24 members of Kaiatian to Waitakian (Late Oligocene to Early Miocene) age are identified. The Te Kuiti Group is subdivided into two subgroups, a lower Okoko Subgroup, and an upper Castle Craig Subgroup. The Okoko Subgroup is dominated by calcareous siltstone and sandstone members, with limestone members commonly occurring at the base of formations, whereas the Castle Craig Subgroup is almost entirely comprised of limestone in the south and by calcareous siltstone in the northern parts of the basin. Six unconformity-bound sequences (TK 1 - TK 6) have been identified and mapped within the Te Kuiti Group using sequence stratigraphic principles. For several of these sequences (TK 2, TK 4, TK 5 TK 6) detailed facies and sequence analyses have been undertaken based on field characteristics, complemented with laboratory grain size and compositional (carbonate % and thin-section) data. The depositional paleoenvironments have been interpreted for these sequences, with the basin evolution for all sequences summarised in a series of 13 paleogeographic maps representing multiple horizons within the Te Kuiti Group. TK 1 strata are mostly terrestrial coal measures (Waikato Coal Measures) of Late Eocene to earliest Oligocene age that accumulated in paleovalleys concurrent with minor extensional faulting. The upper beds are marginal marine and consist primarily of estuarine and shallow shelf mudstone (Mangakotuku Formation). The Early Oligocene (lower Whaingaroan) Glen Massey Formation (TK 2) is entirely marine in origin, its lowermost member (Elgood Limestone Member) marking a significant marine flooding event across the basin with a landward shift in the position of stratal onlap. Whaingaroa Formation (TK 3) comprises predominantly siltstone with some limestone (Awaroa Limestone Member) at its base in the south, which reflects expansion of a southern shelf area. An extensive subaerial unconformity between Whaingaroa Formation (TK 3) and Aotea Formation (TK 4), combined with a basinward shift in the position of onlap for sequence TK 4, indicates a dramatic mid-upper Whaingaroan (c. 29 Ma) change in stratigraphic development and basin dynamics inferred to result from the start of reverse displacement on Taranaki Fault along the basin's western margin. Aotea Formation comprises lithologically diverse facies dominated by limestone (Waimai Limestone Member) in the north, calcareous sandstone (Hauturu Sandstone Member) in the southwest and muddy sandstone (Kihi Sandstone Member) in south-central and eastern areas. A condensed section in the upper parts of Aotea Formation, especially in the north, records relative deepening and reduction of clastic sediment supply into sediment-starved northern parts of the basin. A major erosional unconformity {{at the base of the}} Castle Craig Subgroup in the south and a depositional hiatus in the north reflects a second phase of inversion along the southwestern margin of the basin and reverse displacement on Manganui Fault at c. 27 Ma. The rocky shorelines that consequently formed along the eastern side of the Herangi High supported carbonate factories supplying reworked carbonate to the adjacent shelf (Orahiri Formation and Otorohanga Limestone). These formations pass northward into outer shelf-upper bathyal micritic limestone (Raglan Limestone Member) and calcareous siltstone (marl). Several additional phases of unconformity development are recorded in the Castle Craig Group, but these unconformities had limited extent in the basin, being mainly restricted to the area immediately west of the Herangi High. Early Miocene Waitemata Group strata unconformably overlie the Te Kuiti Group in the north, reflecting basin inversion and erosion driven from a developing subduction zone to the northeast, whereas early Miocene Mahoenui Group strata in southern parts of the basin are mostly conformable on the Te Kuiti Group, having accumulated in a piggy-back basin carried westward on underlying Taranaki and related faults. Tectonic movements and cycles of subsidence and subtle basin inversion driven by the alternate accumulation and release of strain on Taranaki and related fault are regarded as the primary control on relative sea-level changes within the Te Kuiti Group, which led to sequences TK 4 -TK 6. The accumulation of sequences TK 1 -TK 3 resulted from tectonic subsidence in the Waikato region as the zone of extension widened to the east of Taranaki Basin coupled with progressive landward shifts in the position of coastal onlap. Glacio-eustatic sea- level changes driven from glaciations in Antarctica are not regarded as having generated sea-level changes of sufficient magnitude to impact upon the dynamics of late Eocene and Oligocene sedimentation in the Waikato Basin when the Te Kuiti Group accumulated...|$|R
