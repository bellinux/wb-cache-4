50|$|Biomass is {{available}} {{all over the}} world and can be used for the production of electricity on small to medium size scaled power plants. The problem of high <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> for machinery, such as steam boilers, are overcome due to the low working pressures in ORC power plants. Another advantage is the long operational life of the machine due to the characteristics of the working fluid, that unlike steam is non eroding and non corroding for valve seats tubing and turbine blades. The ORC process also helps to overcome the relatively small amount of input fuel available in many regions because an efficient ORC power plant is possible for smaller sized plants.|$|E
40|$|Regarding the {{specific}} costs reactors with low power output have disadvantages compared to large reactors. In this study it was investigated for the HTR Module {{how to reduce}} the <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> and consequently the electricity production costs by modification of the reactor and the power plant design. To reduce the investment costs different design changes were investigated, e. g. possible alternatives for {{the arrangement of the}} reactors and the steam generators and a different building layout. The cost reduction gained by a more compact type of construction and a reduction of the number of large components remains below 10 %. The use of a gas turbine instead of a steam turbine with steam generator would result in a more efficient cost reduction. The increase in the power output has a much bigger potential to reduce the electricity production costs. The best way to realize this is the changing of the core geometry from cylindric to annular. A module concept with a power maximized under certain boundary conditions (limitation of the core temperatures in case of accident, use ofproven technology) was worked out in detail. The optimum core geometry and power density, determined by tolerable accident temperatures and core pressure loss, make a thermal power of 350 MW possible. The physical properties and the accident behaviour in case of drop pressure and water ingress were investigated.

40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} the {{economic}} optimization of a small scale ORC in waste heat recovery application with <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> as objective function. First, a pre-design model of the ORC was built and simulations run with different working fluids to evaluate their technical performance. In a second step, components and system cost models were built and simulations carried out to evaluate the cost effectiveness of systems associated with different fluids. The working fluids considered are R 245 fa, R 123, R 113, n-Pentane and n-Butane. Results indicate that for the same fluid, the point of high performance and that f cost-effectiveness do not match. The operating point for maximum power doesn’t correspond {{to that of the}} minimum <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> <b>cost.</b> For n-Pentane, the maximum net power of 1. 98 kW is obtained for an evaporator pressure of 5. 14 bar and the <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> is 5450 €/kW. For this same fluid, a minimum <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> of 4440 €/kW is obtained for an evaporator pressure of 8. 5 bar and the corresponding power output is 1. 745 kW. The mismatch aforementioned is due to the thermodynamic properties such as liquid/vapour densities, which significantly influence system performance and components sizes.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{relative}} advantage {{of investing in}} a natural gas combined-cycle (NGCC) power plant versus a coal-fired power plant with and without {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) technology. For the investment analysis under uncertainty, we apply fuzzy real options theory. Three different price scenarios for fuel input and CO 2 emission permits are taken into consideration. For the assumptions made, we find evidence that the NGCC and (to a lesser degree) the conventional hard coal-fired power plant are the most cost-effective options, followed by the two CCS technologies ‘Oxyfuel’ and ‘Pre-combustion’. In contrast, due to high <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> and significant losses in conversion efficiency, the third CCS option ‘Post-combustion’ remains uneconomical.

40|$|The {{application}} of CCS technology involves considerable efficiency losses and significant additional investments. The aim is therefore to reduce these efficiency losses and to cut costs. Against this background, membrane-based carbon capture routes for the post-combustion, oxyfuel and pre-combustion technology lines will be analyzed {{in the following}} for hard-coal-fired power plants. To the best knowledge of the authors, this paper {{is the first one}} comparing membrane based capture routes on common technical and economic boundary conditions. The post-combustion process involves a cascade arrangement of polymer membranes. In the optimum case, the efficiency losses for this concept amount to 9. 6 percentage points. In comparison, efficiency losses for the other two membrane-based concepts, i. e. oxyfuel (oxygen transport membrane (OTM) with vacuum pump) and pre-combustion (water-gas shift reactor—WGSMR), are considerably lower (5. 3 / 5. 5 percentage points). The main goal {{of this paper is to}} assess levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for the process routes under consideration and their sensitivity on CO 2 allowance costs, yearly operating hours, membrane costs and membrane lifetime. The <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> for the capture plants are 2410 €/kW h (oxyfuel), 2572 €/kW h (post-combustion) and 2660 €/kW h (pre-combustion). This is 66 % (post-combustion), 55 % (oxyfuel) and 33 % (pre-combustion) above the <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> for the corresponding reference case without carbon capture. Allowance prices in a range from € 20 (pre-combustion) to € 39 (post-combustion) per tonne of CO 2 would be necessary to compensate for the additional investments. Since it can be assumed that the membranes have a limited lifetime, the influence on electricity generation costs was calculated for different lifetimes. The results show that a technical service life of more than 3 years does not have a significant impact on generation costs. This applies to all the technological concepts investigated. In terms of LCOE and CO 2 avoidance costs (€/tCO 2 €/tCO 2) it turns out that oxyfuel and pre-combustion based membrane power plants are favorable compared to the post-combustion route. However, it has to be kept in mind that the uncertainty in membrane costs are higher for the oxyfuel membranes (ceramic oxygen transport membranes) and the pre-combustion membranes (microporous ceramic membranes) compared to the polymeric post-combustion membranes which already have achieved a commercial level...|$|E

The subcritical Organic Rankine Cycle (SCORC) is widely recognized as a viable technology for converting waste heat to electricity. However, a relative large exergy share is destroyed in the evaporator because of the subcritical heat exchange process. A transcritical cycle {{has the potential to}} reduce these irreversibilities in detriment of a financial cost. Therefore the inclusion of financial parameters is crucial for a sound comparison. First, a thermo-hydraulic sizing model for the supercritical ORC is developed. Second, from this model a thermo-economic analysis is provided based on a multi-objective optimization.

40|$|The {{successful}} commercialisation {{of organic}} Rankine cycle (ORC) systems across {{a range of}} power outputs and heat-source temperatures demands step-changes in both improved thermodynamic performance and reduced <b>investment</b> <b>costs.</b> The former can be achieved through high-performance components and optimised system architectures operating with novel working-fluids, whilst the latter requires careful component-technology selection, economies of scale, learning curves and a proper selection of materials and cycle configurations. In this context, thermoeconomic optimisation of the whole power-system should be completed aimed at maximising profitability. This paper couples the computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) of the working-fluid with ORC thermodynamic models, including recuperated and other alternative (e. g., partial evaporation or trilateral) cycles, and a thermoeconomic system assessment. The developed CAMD-ORC framework integrates an advanced molecular-based group-contribution equation of state, SAFT-γ Mie, with a thermodynamic description of the system, and is capable of simultaneously optimising the working-fluid structure, and the thermodynamic system. The advantage of the proposed CAMD-ORC methodology is that it removes subjective and pre-emptive screening criteria that would otherwise exist in conventional working-fluid selection studies. The framework is used to optimise hydrocarbon working-fluids for three different heat sources (150, 250 and 350 °C, each with mcp = 4. 2 kW/K).

However, advanced systems typically have a higher cost of electricity (COE) than the Rankine power plant. High efficiencies do not reduce fuel costs enough to compensate for the high capital costs of advanced concepts.

These cycles have the potentialof improved performance regarding electrical efficiency,specific power output, <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> and cost ofelectricity {{compared with the}} conventional technology, sincethe mixture working fluids enable efficient energyrecovery. This thesis shows that the ammonia-water cycle has a betterthermodynamic performance than the steam Rankine cycle as abottoming process for natural gas-fired gas and gas-dieselengines, since {{the majority of the}} ammonia-water cycleconfigurations investigated generated more power than steamcycles. The best ammonia-water cycle produced approximately 40 - 50 % more power than a single-pressure steam cycle and 20 - 24 % more power than a dual-pressure steam cycle. The investmentcost for an ammonia-water bottoming cycle is probably higherthan for a steam cycle; however, the <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> costmay be lower due to the higher power output. A comparison between combined cycles with ammonia-waterbottoming processes and evaporative gas turbine cycles showedthat the ammonia-water cycle could recover the exhaust gasenergy of a high pressure ratio gas turbine more efficientlythan a part-flow evaporative gas turbine cycle. For a mediumpressure ratio gas turbine, the situation was the opposite,except when a complex ammonia-water cycle configuration withreheat was used. An exergy analysis showed that evaporativecycles with part-flow humidification could recover energy asefficiently as, or more efficiently than, full-flow cycles. Aneconomic analysis confirmed that the <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> costfor part-flow cycles was lower than for full-flow cycles, sincepart-flow humidification reduces the heat exchanger area andhumidification tower volume. In addition, the part-flow cycleshad lower or similar costs of electricity compared with thefull-flow cycles. Compared with combined cycles, the part-flowevaporative cycles had significantly lower total and specificinvestment costs and lower or almost equal costs ofelectricity; thus, part-flow evaporative cycles could competewith the combined cycle for mid-size power generation.

40|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{increased}} demand {{it is necessary}} to build new electrical power plants, which could in an optimal way meet, the imposed acceptability criteria. The main criteria are potential to supply the required energy, to supply this energy with minimal (or at least acceptable) costs, to satisfy licensing requirements and be acceptable to public. The main competitors for unlimited electricity production in next few decades are fossil power plants (coal and gas) and nuclear power plants. New renewable power plants (solar, wind, biomass) are also important but due to limited energy supply potential and high costs can be only supplement to the main generating units. Large hydropower plans would be competitive under condition of existence of suitable sites for construction of such plants. The paper describes the application of a stochastic method for comparing economic parameters of future electrical power generating systems including conventional and nuclear power plants. The method is applied to establish competitive <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> of future nuclear power plants when compared with combined cycle gas fired units combined with wind electricity generators using best estimated and optimistic input data. The bases for economic comparison of potential options are plant life time levelized electricity generating costs. The purpose is to assess the uncertainty of several key performance and cost of electricity produced in coal fired power plant, gas fired power plant and nuclear power plant developing probability distribution of levelized price of electricit...|$|E
40|$|The {{utilization}} of biogas produced from organic {{materials such as}} agricultural wastes or manure is increasing. However, the raw biogas contains {{a large share of}} carbon dioxide which must be removed before utilization in many applications, for example, using the gas as vehicle fuel. The process – biogas upgrading – can be performed with several technologies: water scrubbing, organic solvent scrubbing, amine scrubbing, pressure swing adsorption (PSA), and gas separation membranes. This perspective presents the technologies that are used commercially for biogas upgradin g today, recent developments in the fi eld and compares the technologies with egard to aspects such as technology maturity, investment cost, energy demand and consumables. Emerging technologies for small-scale upgrading and future applications of upgraded biogas such as liquefied biogas are also discussed. It shows that the market situation has changed rapidly in recent years, from being totally dominated by pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and water scrubbing to being more balanced with new technologies (amine scrubbing) reaching significant market shares. There are significant economies of scale for all the technologies investigated, the <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> are similar for plants with a throughput capacity of 1500 Nm 3 raw biogas per hour or larger. Biogas production is increasing in Europe and around the globe, and so is the interest in the effi cient use of upgraded biogas as vehicle fuel or in other applications. The market for biogas upgrading will most likely be characterized by harder competition with the establishment of new upgrading technologies and further optimization of the mature ones to decrease operation costs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMany {{stakeholders}} today consider power tower {{systems to}} be the most promising CSP technology for the future. Therefore much effort is spent to improve individual components and subsystems. While these are valuable steps towards cost reduction, it is also of great importance to perform an overall, i. e. ‘holistic’, system layout and optimization process. Still, even today heliostats are often characterized and even compared using the single parameter ‘cost per square meter’, which is not sufficient. More factors like optical and tracking accuracy, shape, structural deformation under operation loads and maybe even power consumption have to be factored in to allow for a meaningful comparison. In the paper recent activities targeting at a more holistic power tower system optimization are described. For the overall layout process of heliostat field, tower and receiver the complete system is modeled using SAM or an in-house tool based on SolTrace and Matlab to determine investment cost, annual electricity generation and resulting levelised electricity costs. By doing so, different heliostat types and field layouts can be directly compared using LCoE as a reasonable figure of merit. This logical approach to identify the optimum heliostat design is described and illustrated using two generic heliostat designs and the respective field layouts as an example; a recently developed updated tower cost curve is used. It is found that using specific heliostat costs (i. e. $/m 2) alone as a figure of merit to assess different heliostat designs can be misleading, because heliostats characterized by lower <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> <b>costs,</b> but also lower optical and tracking accuracy, can lead to higher levelised electricity costs, which means the real objective of power plant optimization is not reached by looking at heliostat costs per square meter alone...|$|E
40|$|The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is a {{promising}} form of technology for recovering low-grade waste heat. In this study, a regenerative ORC system is established {{to recover the}} waste flue gas of 160 °C. Focusing on thermodynamic and economic performance while simultaneously considering the limitations of volume flow ratio (VFR) {{and the effect of}} superheat, working fluid selection and parameter optimization have been investigated. The optimization of the evaporation temperature is carried out by analyzing the variation of net power output and <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> (SIC). Then, the net power output, specific net power output, total exergy destruction rate, VFR, total capital cost, and levelized electricity cost (LEC) are selected as criteria, and a fuzzy multi-criteria evaluation method is adopted to select a more suitable working fluid and determine the optimal degree of superheat. In addition, the preheating coefficient, latent heat coefficient, superheating coefficient, and internal heat coefficient were proposed to explore the effect of working fluid critical temperature on thermal efficiency. Research studies demonstrate that there is an optimal evaporation temperature, maximizing net power output and minimizing the SIC. Isohexane and butane have greater specific net power output due to greater latent heat. A suitable degree of superheat is not only conducive to improving the working capacity of working fluids, but also reduces the VFR, total capital cost, SIC, and LEC for different working fluids. Thus, the system’s thermodynamic and economic performance—as well as the operational stability—are improved. Among the six working fluids, butane exhibits the best comprehensive performance, and its optimal evaporation temperature and degree of superheat are 100 °C and 5 °C, respectively...|$|R

40|$|There {{is great}} {{interest}} in distributed {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) generation in the built environment due to the higher overall efficiencies attained in comparison to separate provision of these vectors. Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) systems are capable of generating additional electricity from the thermal outputs of CHP engine s, improving the electri cal conversion efficiency and power - to - heat ratio of such system s. Thermodynamic analysis and technical feasibility are {{at the core of the}} development of these systems, while a critical factor for the wider adoption of ORC systems concerns their economic proposition. O btain ing credible estimates of system costs requires correct sizing of individual components. This work focuses on the thermodynamic optimisation, sizing and costin g of ORC units in CHP applications, over a range of heat - source temperatures. The working fluids examined include R 245 fa, R 1233 zd, Pentane and Hexane, due to their good performance and favourable environmental character istics. The o ptim al cycles obtained c an increase the power - to - heat ratio of the complete CHP - ORC system by up to 65 %. A lternative equipment sizing methods are then applied for each fluid and the resultant component sizes are compared. The cost estimates obtained from t he alternative methods are also compared to real ORC application. Based on this, a hybrid costing method is proposed and applied to an ORC system design, in order to obtain the <b>specific</b> <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> (SIC). The results indicate that as the heat source te mperature increases, the power output increases, result ing in larger and more expensive components. Nevertheless, the SIC drops from 1 7 GBP/W for low - power outputs to 1. 1 GBP/W for high - temperature/high - power outputs...|$|R
