50|$|After {{an upgrade}} in 2015, the route through to Lincoln (and beyond to Doncaster) has a regular {{role as a}} diversionary route for trains from the East Coast Main Line mostly for <b>slower</b> <b>freight</b> <b>services,</b> but {{occasionally}} for passenger trains too. As a result the route is now open 24 hours per day.|$|R
50|$|The first American 2-6-0 with a rigidly mounted {{leading axle}} was the Pawnee, built for heavy <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> on the Philadelphia and Reading Rail Road. In total, about thirty {{locomotives}} {{of this type}} were built for various American railroads. While they were generally successful in <b>slow,</b> heavy <b>freight</b> <b>service,</b> the railroads that used these first 2-6-0 locomotives didn't see any great advantages in them over the 0-6-0 or 0-8-0 designs of the time. The railroads noted their increased pulling power, but also found that their rather rigid suspension made them more prone to derailments than the 4-4-0 locomotives of the day. Many railroad mechanics attributed these derailments to having too little weight on the leading truck.|$|R
50|$|On 10 September 2008, Network Rail {{unveiled}} a £400M regeneration and reconfiguration of Reading station and surrounding track incorporating an overpass {{system to the}} West of the station; with freight and passenger trains able to transit from the Reading to Taunton Line and Reading to Basingstoke Line to the 'slow' lines via an underpass beneath the 'fast' lines, replacing the conventional at-grade crossing of the 'fast' lines via points, {{with the aim of}} alleviating delays due to <b>slow</b> moving <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> passing through the station. By 2014 the total cost had risen to more than £800M.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{the type}} {{evolved from the}} 2-6-0 configuration. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (AT&SF) became a pioneer of the type in the United States in 1901 {{and one of the}} largest fleet users of the type. Problems the road {{encountered}} with the type included steam leakage in the compound cylinder plumbing and instability at speed. The former problem was solved by converting them to simplex two-cylinder locomotives; the latter problem required new Pacific types with four-wheeled guide trucks. The Prairie types were rebuilt with smaller drivers for slightly <b>slower</b> fast <b>freight</b> <b>service.</b> These engines tended to enjoy very long service lives, and outlasted many a newer, more efficient steam locomotive on the Santa Fe and elsewhere. This was due to their modest weight, good speed and ability to operate well in reverse, which made them valuable for branch line operations.|$|R
50|$|Heavy and <b>slow</b> <b>freight</b> trains {{still use}} the {{original}} (eastern) {{approach to the}} Riedbahn.|$|R

60|$|I used {{to own a}} clock which gurgled in {{its throat}} three minutes before it struck the hour. I know, therefore, the <b>slow</b> <b>freight</b> of Anticipation. For I have awakened {{at three in the}} morning, heard the clock gurgle, and waited those three minutes for the three strokes I knew were to come. Alors. In Ross's ranch house that night the <b>slow</b> <b>freight</b> of Climax whistled in the distance.|$|R
50|$|From late 2016, 201 Class {{locomotives}} {{will operate}} increased <b>freight</b> <b>services</b> as {{the weight and}} length of some <b>freight</b> <b>services</b> will be increased due to customer demand.|$|R
50|$|Once upon a time, Class 2700 {{locomotive}} {{was also}} used for <b>freight</b> <b>services</b> as well.Due to several mechanical constraints, they were taken off from the <b>freight</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{their early}} years the {{locomotives}} hauled express trains (later known as InterCity) and heavy <b>freight</b> <b>services,</b> {{but in their}} later years they were transferred to smaller regional and light <b>freight</b> <b>services.</b>|$|R
50|$|In July 2016, GSP {{airport and}} Senator International of Germany {{announced}} that a regularly scheduled twice-weekly <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> would begin in November between Greenville/Spartanburg and Munich, Germany.

Senator International began the international <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> to Germany in November, operated by Air Atlanta Icelandic with a Boeing 747-400F aircraft, to both Munich and Frankfurt-Hahn.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, the San Diego County Board of Supervisors became {{concerned}} about the <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> on the SD Direct <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> to the East was seen as vital to the county's economic interests and the continued viability of San Diego as a deep-water port. With an eye towards preserving <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> and future transit right-of-way, San Diego County commissioned its own internal study effort, [...] "Feasibility of Using Existing SD ROW for Commuter Service", to examine using {{a portion of the}} SD tracks for light rail or diesel passenger service sharing track with <b>freight</b> <b>services.</b> Part of the motivation for considering the SD was to [...] "operate the <b>freight</b> <b>service</b> at a profit through changes to work rules, relief from property taxes, and sharing of costs with the transit operation".|$|R
