Most North American manufacturers produced these machines as either regular models or as size options.

This baler baled successfully from 1937 onwards. Certainly the quality of the New Holland machines, popularised twine tying hay balers. In Europe, in as early as 1939, both Claas of Germany and Rousseau SA of France had automatic twine tying pick-up balers. Most of these produced low density bales though. The first successful pick-up balers were made by the Ann Arbor Company in 1929. Ann Arbor were acquired by the Oliver Farm Equipment Company in 1943.

30|$|The most {{important}} mechanical {{characteristic of a}} loop which determines the type of tooth movement is the moment/force ratio (M/F ratio) [12, 13]. As TMA wires exert lesser force than SS wires {{for the same amount}} of activation, hence, M/F ratio will be more in loops fabricated by TMA wires. Higher dimension TMA wires used in prescribed slot result in lesser amount of play and better torque expression that is further reinforced by gable bends given anteriorly in loops. This results in increased counterbalancing moment, hence better M/F ratios with higher dimension wires. This justifies the use of TMA wires of higher dimension in 0.18 <b>slot</b> over SS <b>wires</b> in the present study. According to the orthodontic literature, M/F ratio of 5 : 1 produces uncontrolled tipping, ratio of 7 : 1 produces controlled tipping, ratio of 10 : 1 produces bodily movement, and ratios greater than 10 : 1 produces root movement in labial orthodontics [13].|$|R

Methods: Four brackets were mounted on a custom metal fixture allowing an 0. 018 -in stainless steel wire attached to an opposite fixture with one bracket to be passively centered in the bracket <b>slot.</b> The <b>wire</b> was ligated to the bracket using one of five types of ligatures including the low friction test ligatures (AO), conventional ligatures (AO), Sili–TiesTM, Silicone Infused Ties (GAC), Synergy® Low-Friction Ligatures (RMO), and SuperSlick ligatures (TP Orthodontics). Resistance to sliding was measured over a 7 mm sliding distance using a universal testing machine (Instron) with a 50 Newton load cell and a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. The initial resistance to sliding (static) {{was determined by the}} peak force needed to initiate movement and the kinetic resistance to sliding was taken as the force at 5 mm of wire/bracket sliding. Fifteen unique tests were run for each ligature group in both dry and wet (saliva soaked for 24 hours with one drop prior to testing) conditions. Results: In the dry state, the SuperSlick ligature demonstrated more static friction than all of the other ligatures, while SuperSlick and Sili–Ties demonstrated more kinetic friction than the AO conventional, AO experimental and Synergy ligatures. In the wet condition, SuperSlick and the AO experimental ligature demonstrated the least static friction, followed by the AO conventional and Sili–Ties. The most static friction was observed with the Synergy ligatures. In the wet condition, the SuperSlick, AO experimental and AO conventional exhibited less kinetic friction than the Sili-Ties and Synergy ligatures. Conclusions: AO 2 ̆ 7 s experimental ligature exhibits less friction in the wet state than conventional ligatures, Sili–Ties and Synergy and is comparable to the SuperSlick ligature.

Maxwell's equations and noise theory form the basis of the analyses in which three independent methods are used to predict a spatial distribution which exhibits interference minima and maxima. In the first, the wave equation is solved for a noise-excited transmission line which is suddenly short- and open-circuited at alternate ends. By a study of the trapped noise currents, it is found that the radiation pattern has an interference structure which is smoothed as the loss is increased. Secondly, a formula is derived for the radiation pattern of a heated wire by a computation of its absorption in an isothermal enclosure and by an application of the principle of detailed balancing. Finally, the pattern of a long thin slot is computed directly using the Lpontovich-Rytov distributed source generalization of Nyquist's noise formula.

In late 2010, {{as part of a}} pallid {{sturgeon}} recovery program, the USBR and USACE began construction of a new state-of-the-art screened canal head works structure. After over 100 years of unscreened operations, the new fish screened facility was opened in spring 2012. The head works will be integrated into a major river gradient fish passage facility being proposed for construction soon. When completed, the new passage and protection facilities will reduce fish entrainment and open an additional 165 miles of river habitat for the endangered and native fishes. The new headwork facility’s fish protection system consists of twelve, 6. 5 -foot diameter and 25 feet long cylindrical fish protection screens. Each screen is designed to seal over the intake’s submerged sluice gates spaced along the 350 -foot long riverbank facility. An integrated and flush-mounted track system was built into the vertical concrete walls to raise the screens in the non-irrigation season for protection from the significant ice and flood flows common on the river. When the 71 -mile long irrigation canal is operational, each screen is lowered into position and an automatic brush cleaning system is used to keep the 1. 75 mm wedge <b>wire</b> <b>slots</b> from clogging.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this project {{is to develop a}} {{sediment}} exclusion device for use with village-scale water systems in developing countries. Reducing sediment mitigates abrasion and deposition in system components, leading to increased system life. Using the engineering down select process, a device that uses a Coanda effect screen was determined to best meet the project objectives and constraints. The device was tested in a laboratory set-up and in a field prototype. Laboratory tests were used to determine the hydraulic performance for five Coanda effect screens, each with unique geometry; the field prototype was completed to confirm the constructability and sustainability of the design. The design parameters include sediment concentration, sediment size distribution, flow rate, dimensions of the Coanda effect screen (<b>slot</b> width, <b>wire</b> tilt angle, and wire width), and geometry of the spillway structure. Performance was assessed by measuring the fraction of sediment removed by the screen and the change in flowrate through the screen during a 10 minute batch trial with a sediment concentration of 20, 000 mg/l. Analysis of sediment size distributions showed that of the screens tested, a 1. 0 mm slot width screen with a 3 / 16 ” wire width and a 10 o wire tilt angle was the most effective at removing sediment, with 48. 5 % of the material in the 0. 5 - 0. 85 mm range being removed and 65 % of material from the 0. 85 – 1 mm range being removed, compared with the 0. 5 mm screen (tilt angle and wire width identical to 1. 0 mm slot width) which removed 87 % of material in the 0. 5 mm – 0. 85 mm range and removed 100 % of material from 0. 85 – 1. 0 mm. Flow testing indicated that screen blockage by sediment particles reduced the flow through the screen by 3 % during the trial run for a screen with a 1. 0 mm slot width, whereas a screen with a 0. 5 mm slot width resulted in a decrease in through flow capacity of 46 % from initial flow rate of 13 gpm. Based on the target flow rate and the laboratory test results, a Coanda effect screen of 1. 0 mm slot width (geometry listed previously) can be used to efficiently remove sediment down to 0. 5 mm, while also maintaining an adequate flow rate, throughout system use, because 49 % of material between 0. 5 – 0. 85 mm was removed while only losing 3 % of the Coanda effect screen’s initial through flow capacity. Field testing showed that the spillway section can be built using locally available materials and tools, except the Coanda Effect screen itself, while meeting the 4 work days for 4 workers constraint. The design team concludes that the Coanda Effect screen can be used to reliably remove sediment from sediment laden flows...|$|R
40|$|Virtualization of {{wireless}} networks holds {{the promise of}} major gains in resource usage efficiency through spectrum/radio resources sharing between multiple service providers (SPs). Radio resources however are not like a simple orthogonal resource such as time <b>slots</b> on a <b>wire</b> and its shared quantity {{is a function of}} geography and signal strength, rather than orthogonal slices. To better exploit the radio resource usage, we propose a novel scheme - radio resource virtualization (RRV) that allows SPs to access overlapping spectrum slices both in time and in space considering the transmit power, the interference, and the usage scenario (capabilities/needs of devices). We first investigate the system capacity of a simple two-cell network and show that RRV often leads to better efficiency than the well-known separate spectrum virtualization (SSV) scheme. However, the use of RRV requires careful air-interface configuration due to interference in the overlapping slices of spectrum. Therefore we next examine scenarios of a multi-cell network with fractional frequency reuse (FFR) implementing five radio resources configuration cases. From the evaluation of capacity data obtained from simulations, a variety of tradeoffs exist between SPs if RRV is applied. One example shows that capacity of the SP that operates smaller cells almost doubles while capacity of the SP deployed in larger cells may drop by 20 % per subscriber. Based on these tradeoffs, we suggest configuration maps in which a network resource manager can locate specific configurations according to the demand and capabilities of SPs and their subscribers. Finally, we consider a case study on top of LTE. A system-level simulator is developed following 3 GPP standards and extensive simulations are conducted. We propose and test 3 schemes that integrate RRV into the LTE radio resource management (RRM) [...] unconditional RRV, time domain muting (TDM) RRV and major-interferer time domain muting (MI-TDM) RRV. Along the same line as the capacity analysis, we compare those schemes with the traditional SSV and suggest configuration maps based on the produced tradeoffs. Our investigation of RRV provides a framework that evaluates the resource efficiency, and potentially the ability of customization and isolation of spectrum sharing in virtualized cellular networks...|$|R
40|$|The {{lithium lens}} in the {{antiproton}} source target vault {{is protected by}} an interlock system, which is located in relay racks R 5 and R 6 near {{the southwest corner of}} the Target Hall (building APO). The interlock system consists of crates of commercial signal conditioner and alarm modules built by Acromag, Inc and interlock Master Modules built by Fermilab: Twenty analog signals from the lens/transformer, power supply, and cooling water system are buffered with signal conditioners (amplifiers), which are located in creates R 5 C and R 5 E. The signals and conditioner assignments are listed in Table 1. Interconnection details are shown in Figure 1. Thermocouple signals come into the conditioners directly from the vault or water system via 12 -pair multiconductor thermocouple extension cables. All other signals pass through a master connection panel on the east end of rack R 6. Water flow signals are AC voltages which must be converted by electronics in crate D 2 B to DC voltages before entering their signal conditioners. Each conditioner drives two parallel outputs. One output goes to a Multiplexed Analog to Digital Converter (MADC 25), which is located in R 5 D. This voltage output is read by the accelerator control network (ACNET) and can be displayed at any control console on parameter page P 46. The other voltage output is connected to an alarm module. Thirteen analog signals are processed by alarm modules, which are located in crates R 6 B and R 6 C. Alarm connection details are shown in Figure 2. Each alarm module contains two DPDT relays, one for an upper limit and one for a lower limit. The relays are latching, so that once an input has passed outside a limit, that limit relay remains in the tripped condition until an operator issues a reset pulse. The reset may be generated locally with a pushbutton on the appropriate interlock master module or remotely from controls parameter page P 46 via ACNET. Alarm settings are summarized in engineering units in Table 1, and actual comparitor voltage settings are listed in Figure 2. Each alarm crate contains 10 module <b>slots</b> and is <b>wired</b> as shown in Figure 3, except for the water conductivity <b>slot,</b> which is <b>wired</b> to a separate interlock chain output. Normally open contacts are used for interlock chains, while normally closed contacts provide status bits. The interlock chain outputs are connected to Interlock Master Modules located in D 5 C. Status bits are read into ACNET through a multiplexer in R 4 A, and can be displayed on parameter page S 40. Any alarm slot may be bypassed by inserting a 'dummy' printed circuit card in place of a module. Each interlock master module sums 5 inputs and provides 3 reed relay contact closure outputs. A circuit schematic is shown in Figure 4. Input 1 requires + 5 volts, and directly energizes an interlock chain relay. Input 2 and 3 require TTL logic levels, and inputs 4 and 5 require and external contact closure. Internal switches select which inputs are active Interlock master interconnections are shown in Figure 5. The lens uses two masters, one for water conductivity and the other for all interlocked conditions. The Conductivity Master controls the lens water purging system and also energizes one input of the General Master. The General Master provides the external interlock for the pulsed power supply. If lithium comes into contact with the cooling water, the conductivity master will trip. Output 2 of the Master shuts off the water circulating pump and initiates purging hardware, which isolates the lens from the water supply and allows inert gas to force remaining water from the lens into a reservoir located in the vault. Output 1 of the Master, which is connected to input 4 of the lens General Master, causes the General Master to trip and disable the pulsed power supply. All other lens alarm conditions (except conductivity) enter input 1 and 2 of the Lens General Master. An alarm condition from these inputs will disable the pulsed power supply, but the water system will remain on. Each interlock master has a manual Emergency Stop pushbutton (red) on its front panel. The pushbutton has alternating action, one push enabling the interlock master, the next push opening the interlock chain. all interlock masters are connected to an audible trip alarm module located in R 5 E- 6...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the retch wire screen as a potential tool for collecting feces from water, by comparing its apparent digestibility estimates {{with that of the}} conventional stripping method. The retch wire screen is designed as a wire mesh for collecting or trapping feces that is removed from the tank along with the outlet water. The <b>slots</b> between the <b>wire</b> screens allow the passage of the outlet water while the trapped feces are collected from the wire screens for analysis. Three different diets with fishmeal, soybean meal and rapeseed meal were produced by extrusion. The diets were fed once a day to triplicate groups of rainbow trout with an average weight of 120 grams, reared in 14 oC freshwater. The experiment lasted for 22 days. Feces were obtained by careful stripping from the distal abdomen and collected from the wire screen 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 minutes past feeding. Faecal dry matter, organic matter, carbon, nitrogen, sulphur and yttrium oxide (Y 2 O 3) were analysed in diets and freeze dried feces samples, and apparent digestibilities (AD) were calculated. AD estimates of organic matter, nitrogen and sulphur obtained by collecting feces on the wire mesh collector were higher than AD estimates obtained by the stripping method, except for some values obtained for AD of carbon. This shows that leaching of nutrients from the feces was immediate. Compared to this initial leaching of nutrients, the leaching loss caused by prolonged collection times from 15 to 240 minutes was small. The percentage difference observed in AD estimate between stripping and feces collected with the retch wire screen were lower than values reported in previous methods of feces collection from water media. The relative ranking of the apparent digestibility among the 3 diets in the ANOVA analysis showed the same statistical ranking, and this may facilitate use of the tool, eventually by the employment of a correction factor. There were significant differences observed in the faecal dry matter among the diets for both methods of faecal collection. Soybean meal showed the lowest faecal dry matter among the diets. AD of nitrogen was significantly higher for the soybean meal diet than for the fishmeal diet when feces were obtained by stripping. Soybean meal also gave the highest estimates of nitrogen AD for feces collection at all the time intervals while rapeseed meal recorded the lowest Nitrogen AD. Rapeseed meal also showed the poorest digestibility in both methods of faecal collection for organic matter, carbon and sulphur. Sulphur AD obtained with the rapeseed meal diet by the stripping method was particularly low (54. 7 %), compared to the fishmeal and soybean meal diets that had 72. 4 and 70. 1 % respectively. The likely reason for this was attributed to low digestibility of sulphur containing amino acids in the rapeseed, possibly due to antinutrient factors...|$|R
