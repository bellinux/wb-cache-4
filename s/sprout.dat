30|$|<b>Sprouting</b> {{is widely}} {{accepted}} as a persistence mechanism for hardwood trees (Bond and Midgley 2001, Del Tredici 2001) and is commonly discussed as an important fire adaptation for several pine species (e.g., shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.), pitch pine (P. rigida Mill.); Mattoon 1915, Welch et al. 2000). However, <b>sprouting</b> of longleaf pine seedlings has received relatively little attention. Farrar (1975) used mechanical clipping to test for <b>sprouting</b> responses and reported that up to 60 % of small grass stage seedlings <b>sprouted,</b> with lower <b>sprouting</b> rates as tree size increased. We observed <b>sprouting</b> across all study treatments, including the control, but the rate of <b>sprouting</b> did not exceed 30 % of the original population for any seedling size and treatment combination. However, <b>sprouting</b> was more common for small seedlings and seedlings in the high-temperature burn treatment, suggesting that the <b>sprouting</b> response was associated with severity of seedling damage.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe study {{investigates the}} effect of seed <b>sprouting</b> on minerals, anti {{nutrients}} and pasting characteristics of flours produced from some tropical legume seeds. Samples were collected from cowpea (Vigna ungulculata); red kidney beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), and Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) and each sample was divided into two portions. A portion was <b>sprouted</b> while the other portion served as the control. The flours from <b>sprouted</b> and non-sprouted seeds were analyzed for the minerals, anti nutritional and pasting properties. The samples were found to differ significantly (p< 0. 05) in the minerals, anti nutritional composition and pasting properties of the flours. <b>Sprouting</b> increased the mineral contents of the flours generally the calcium content of non-sprouted red kidney beans (13. 8 mg/ 100 g) increased to 16. 1 mg/ 100 g in the <b>sprouted</b> flour.

5|$|Gyromitra esculenta {{grows on}} sandy soil in Temperate {{coniferous}} forest and occasionally in deciduous woodlands. Among conifers {{it is mostly}} found under pines (Pinus spp.), but also sometimes under aspen (Populus spp.). The hunting period is from April to July, earlier than for other species, and the fungus may even <b>sprout</b> up with the melting snow. It can be abundant in some years and rare in others. The mushroom is more commonly found in places where ground has been disturbed, such as openings, rivulets, washes, timber clearings, plowed openings, forest fire clearings, and roadsides. Enthusiasts in Finland have been reported burying newspaper inoculated with the fungus in the ground in autumn and returning the following spring to collect mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|Regular pruning is {{important}} to give the plant an attractive habit and prevent it from becoming leggy. As most cultivated forms of this species have a lignotuber, dormant buds exist below the bark that respond to pruning or fire, and hard-pruning is possible almost to ground level as a plant can readily <b>sprout</b> from old wood. This {{is not the case}} for var.cunninghamii which should not be pruned below foliage. Flowering may take up to eight years from germination; buying an advanced plant may hasten this process, as will getting a cutting-grown plant. Banksia spinulosa can be propagated easily by seed, {{and is one of the}} (relatively) easier banksias to propagate by cutting. Named cultivars are by necessity propagated by cuttings as this ensures that the plant produced bears the same attributes as the original plant.|$|E
5|$|Strict Jains don't eat root {{vegetables}} such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers. This is so because tiny life forms are injured when {{the plant is}} pulled up and because the bulb {{is seen as a}} living being, as it is able to <b>sprout.</b> Also, consumption of most {{root vegetables}} involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, in contrast to consumption of most other terrestrial vegetables, upon which the plant lives on after plucking the vegetables (or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Mushrooms, fungi and yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites, grow in non-hygienic environments, and may harbour other life forms. Alfalfa is the only known plant that contains vitamin D2, which they may use directly or make vitamin D2 supplements from. Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to violence against the bees.|$|E

5|$|The seeds {{maintain}} their germinative powers for decades, up {{to a hundred}} years, according to some studies. Because of this, and because the plant is an extremely prolific seed bearer (each plant produces hundreds of capsules, each containing up to 700+ seeds, with a total up to 180,000 or 240,000 seeds), it remains in the soil seed bank for extended periods of time, and can <b>sprout</b> from apparently bare ground, or shortly after forest fires long after previous plants have died. Its population pattern typically consists of an ephemeral adult population followed by {{a long period of}} dormancy as seeds. Great mullein rarely establishes on new grounds without human intervention because its seeds do not disperse very far. Seed dispersion requires the stem to be moved by wind or animal movement; 75% of the seeds fall within 1 m of the parent plant, and 93% fall within 5 m.|$|E

5|$|As {{wildfire}} is {{a natural}} part of most ecosystems, plants that are indigenous to Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways. Douglas-fir have a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires. Lodgepole Pines —the most common tree species in the park— generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and downed wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish. Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Whitebark Pine, and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur. Aspen trees <b>sprout</b> new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years.|$|E

We used two treatments: clipping at stem base, and clipping followed by burning with a blowtorch. A dichotomy accounted for > 60 % of deviance explained by species identity. Models with three or four groups were not substantially better. The dichotomy was not between 0 % and 100 % <b>sprouting,</b> rather between ‘weak’ and ‘strong’ sprouters. Probabilities of <b>sprouting</b> for weak sprouters were 23 % after clipping and 6 % after burning, while strong sprouters had <b>sprouting</b> probabilities of 90 % after clipping and 79 % after burning. While <b>sprouting</b> varied in space and time, the dichotomy was robust to this variation. <b>Sprouting</b> ability increased with size in most of the species with variable <b>sprouting.</b> <b>Sprouting</b> was partially related to growth form; grasses <b>sprouted</b> strongly, chenopods weakly, and forb and woody species covered the range of <b>sprouting.</b> Strong sprouters were likely to have more stems per plant, greater basal area, shorter potential height and deeper buds than weak sprouters.
