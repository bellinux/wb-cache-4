40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The {{torsion test}} was {{evaluated}} {{as a method}} for determining the shear strength of full-size structural lumber. The evaluation involved an experimental length study, an experimental depth study, and a finite element study. The length study consisted of fifty nominal 2 x 4 specimens, ten specimens for each length, and ten American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) <b>shear</b> <b>blocks.</b> One 14 foot long board yielded one specimen for each length: (a) 21. 0 ", (b) 28. 5 ", (c) 32. 0 ", (d) 35. 5 ", (e) 39. 0 ", and (f) an ASTM D 143 - 94 shear block. The statistical analysis revealed {{no evidence that the}} length affected the shear strength. The depth study consisted of fifty specimens, ten specimens for each depth: (a) 2 x 4, (b) 2 x 6, (c) 2 x 8, (d) 2 x 10, and (e) 2 x 12. In addition, fifty ASTM <b>shear</b> <b>blocks,</b> one block for each specimen, were tested. The statistical study did not reveal convincing evidence of a depth effect on shear strength, even after accounting for specific gravity and shear span as covariates. Failure modes for the torsion samples involved a longitudinal shear crack at the mid-point of the longest side, which propagated toward the ends of the specimen and through the cross section perpendicular to the growth rings. The finite element model revealed that uniform shear stress occurs within the shear span, which begins and ends a distance of approximately two times the depth plus the grip distance away from each end of the member. In addition, torsion theory verified that the experimental shear failure plane that occurs within the shear span is parallel to the grain and the shear slippage is also parallel to the grain, similar to the known shear failure in specimens subjected to bending loads. Based on the results of this study, the torsion test is the best practical method to determine the pure shear strength of full-size structural lumber, because the test yields 100...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{punching shear}} response of reinforced-concrete flat slabs under fire conditions. The shear behaviour of concrete in fire is relatively poorly understood compared to its flexural response. Failures {{such as the}} Gretzenbach car park failure in Switzerland (2004) have prompted concerns over the punching shear capacity of flat slabs in fire. The shear behaviour of reinforced-concrete in fire depends on degradation of the individual material properties with temperature, their interaction, and more recently recognised, the effects of restrained thermal expansion. Through experimental testing this thesis aims to build a foundation understanding of the punching shear behaviour of flat reinforced-concrete slabs in fire conditions. A series of <b>shear</b> <b>blocks,</b> tested after exposure to elevated temperature (realistic fire temperature), were used to {{develop an understanding of}} the effects of elevated temperature on the shear transfer performance of reinforced-concrete. These tests allowed the complex interplay of shear-carrying mechanisms at ambient temperature to be extended to the case of post-elevated temperature. Fifteen slab-column punching shear specimens were tested under both applied load and extreme heating. In particular, the effects of restrained thermal expansion were experimentally investigated by altering the support conditions of the slab-column specimens. A purpose-built restraint frame allowed the boundary support conditions to be either fully restrained or unrestrained. This experimental series is the only series to have tested restrained specimens at elevated temperatures, though previous researchers have simulated the thermal restraint effects and reported the importance of restrained thermal expansion and curvature on the behaviour of punching shear. Parameters of slab thickness and reinforcement ratio were also varied to investigate their respective impacts on punching shear behaviour at elevated temperature. The thicker 100 mm reinforced slabs failed in punching shear, whereas the 50 mm and 75 mm thick slabs failed in flexure-shear mechanisms and the unreinforced slabs failed in flexure. Clear behavioural differences were observed between specimens with different support conditions. Unrestrained 100 mm thick slabs under sustained load failed soon after heating began, whereas none of the corresponding restrained specimens failed during heating. One restrained, heavily reinforced specimen failed during cooling, whilst under sustained load. This is the first recorded punching shear failure during the cooling phase of an elevated temperature test and may also be the first recorded test specimen ever to have failed during the cooling phase of an elevated temperature test. This failure highlights the unknown and potentially unsafe behaviour of structures during the cooling phase. Further structural investigation of the cooling behaviour of concrete flat slabs after exposure to fire, needs to be undertaken. Most of the specimens’ central deflection was away from the heat source (in the direction of loading) during the whole test, irrespective of support condition. The test setup was assessed to investigate the unusual slab-column deflection away from the heat source, however the complex behaviour observed during the tests cannot currently be explained. It is assumed that the degradation in concrete properties and non-linear material behaviour dominates over the thermal expansion of the slabs. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons are presented, though the quantitative data is impacted by size effect, non-repeatable heating application between tests and jack friction influences on specimens with low capacities. Eurocode 2 punching shear prescriptive elevated temperature design, extends the ambient temperature equation for elevated temperature use, by degrading the temperature-dependant parameters by factors. Support conditions are not considered, with the code specifically telling the designer not to consider in-plane thermal expansion effects, therefore consequently ignoring the premature punching shear failure that can occur. Furthermore, the ambient temperature equation is based on the regression of available experimental data at the time and does not consider the reinforcement as a shear transfer mechanism. The experimental capacities of the 100 mm thick, reinforced slabs that failed in pure punching shear mechanism were similar to the Eurocode 2 punching shear prescriptive design capacity, when directly compared. The unrestrained support condition was shown to be consistently, not conservatively predicted by Eurocode 2, whereas the restrained support condition capacities were conservatively predicted. It is comforting to know that the Eurocode 2 design predicts the restrained supported slabs conservatively, as real buildings {{are more likely to have}} supports closer to the restrained condition rather than the unrestrained support condition. A sensitivity analysis of the Eurocode 2 prescriptive design equation shows it is highly sensitive to the concrete strength degradation and not the variable, cp, which was used to make a support condition comparison in this thesis. This indicates how the Eurocode 2 equation for punching shear capacity lacks in its consideration of whole structural behaviour. The Critical Shear Crack Theory has been proposed as the background to a harmonised shear design approach, called Model Code 2010. The Critical Shear Crack Theory was safe in predicting the experimental punching shear capacities. There were large variances for the 100 mm thick slabs, however they are consistent with the original model comparison to test data. An expansion of the Critical Shear Crack Theory for elevated temperature requires further validation with experimental restrained thermal expansion tests, such as those presented in this thesis. Finally, a digital image correlation technique has been proven to be a reliable method to measure structural displacements of concrete at elevated temperatures. Digital image correlation allowed the crack locations and slab rotation angles to be visualized throughout testing. No other measurement techniques are able to provide similar versatility in fire testing such as that presented herein...|$|E

While focus of {{previous}} studies on the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of coped steel I-beam was mainly given to the connections with double clip angles, single-sided connections, which induce out-of-plane loading eccentricity, have not been adequately considered. Ten full-scale coped steel I-beam tests were conducted to examine the effects of two main test parameters, namely, out-of-plane loading eccentricity and web block aspect ratio (ratio of shear area to tension area). It was found that nine test specimens failed with tension fracture along the bottom bolt row of the web, and the remaining one failed in a whole block tear-out manner. Twisting of the web near the cope was observed for specimens with single-sided connection. More importantly, the test results showed that the out-of-plane loading eccentricity due to the single-sided connection did not have a detrimental effect on the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of the specimens. Moreover, increasing the connection rotational stiffness could increase the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity. These effects are further discussed via a finite element analysis and a preliminary parametric study. Finally, the test results are compared with four major design standards. It is found that the Canadian Standards CAN/CSA-S 16 - 09, which gives a test-to-predicted ratio ranged from 0. 93 to 1. 17, provided relatively good predictions for the specimens with single bolt line layout, while the predictions by other codes are too conservative. For those specimens with double bolt line layout, the capacities are underestimated by all the considered standards. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> of coped beams with a welded clip angle connection is presented in this paper. Twelve full-scale coped steel I-beam tests were conducted. The test parameters included the web block aspect ratio (height to width ratio of the web block connected to the clip angle) and the connection rotational stiffness. Out of the 12 test specimens, eight test specimens failed in <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> of the connection, namely, tensile fracture of the block width (the web underneath the clip angle) and shear yielding of the block height (the web along the vertical side of the clip angle). Two test specimens failed by local web buckling at the cope, one test specimen failed in the welds and the remaining one did not fail due to the limited capacity of the loading jack. The test results showed that in general the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of the test specimens increased with increasing web block aspect ratio and increasing connection rotational stiffness. The current design specifications (AISC-LRFD, CAN/CSA-S 16 - 09, CAN/CSA-S 16 - 01, BS EN 1993 - 1 - 8 - 2005, BS 5950 - 1 : 2000, and AIJ- 1990) provide conservative estimates of the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of the test specimens except for the specimen that had the smallest connection rotational stiffness. It {{should be noted that}} none of the design equations evaluated in this programme consider the influence of the web block aspect ratio and the connection rotational stiffness.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{describes}} an experimental investigation of characteriza-tion methods for ductile core materials. Full-field optical strain measurement methods {{are used to}} determine the strain distributions in standard testing methods such as <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> and four-point beam testing, particularly for highly ductile cores subjected to large deformations. The results show that the stress and strain fields in both <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> and sandwich beam tests are very different to those assumed by the testing standards. The test methods result in complex post yield states of stress in the core materials, meaning the core shear strength and ultimate shear strain should not be calculated by classical methods in the post yield region.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} direct experimental verifications of {{the active}} shear planes in bolted connections, previously identified by the first author for determining the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity. The laboratory test results were obtained by independent researchers for specimens where the applied loads were resisted by the 2 ̆ 2 block 2 ̆ 2 in shear only. The first set consists of five bolted connection specimens in the webs of wide flange sections where the tensile resistance planes had been sawn off. The second set consists of ten bolted connection specimens each in one leg of an angle section that had fractured completely along the net tensile plane through a <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> failure. Comparisons among the gross, net, and active shear planes against the independent laboratory test {{results showed that the}} critical shear planes of bolted connections were best represented by the active shear planes rather than either the gross or the net shear planes. It is also pointed out that full or almost full shear strain hardening was generally achieved at the ultimate limit state of <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> failure of bolted connections in hot-rolled steel plates or sections, irrespective of the connection length. Verification against independent laboratory test results of tee sections bolted at the web reinforces this point...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{study of the}} <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> strength and behavior of coped beams with welded end connections. The finite-element (FE) method was employed to predict the structural behavior and <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of specimens tested during a previous experimental {{study conducted by the}} writers. In general, the finite-element analysis results compared well with the test results, and the validated finite-element models were used subsequently to further investigate the structural behavior of the connections through a parametric study. The results show that the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of coped beams with welded end connections, in general, increases with increasing connection rotational stiffness and increasing web block aspect ratio (depth/width). It was found that, for design purposes, connections with a large web block aspect ratio (large depth and narrow width) should be used to reduce the effects of loading eccentricity between the centroid of the weld group of the connection and the support. The finite-element analysis results also show that, for the coped beams with small connection rotational stiffness, shear yielding only occurs over {{a small portion of the}} shear area. Based on the test and the finite-element analysis results, a design equation previously proposed by the first writer for evaluating the <b>block</b> <b>shear</b> capacity of a coped beam with a welded clip angle connection was modified to account for the effects of the connection rotational stiffness. The predictions based on the modified design equation compare well with the test and the finite-element analysis results. The ratio of the test and the FE capacities to the predicted capacities has a mean of 1. 01 and a coefficient of variation of 0. 05.

40|$|We {{determined}} the local strain profile in <b>sheared</b> lamellar <b>block</b> copolymers. A trilayer model, based on elastic brushes separated by viscous interpenetration zones, captures the rheological response {{of these materials}} and provides {{a measure of the}} relative contributions of elastic versus viscous strain. The elastic chain distortions were evident from a reversible lamellar contraction, as measured from in situ small-angle x-ray scattering. The contraction was directly correlated to the elastic strain from our trilayer model; three distinct diblock copolymers conform to the predicted relationship, thus suggesting universal behavior...|$|R
