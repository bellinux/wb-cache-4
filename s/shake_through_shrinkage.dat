40|$|This {{study of}} nitrogen-diluted non-premixed {{counterflow}} flames with finite burner diameters investigates {{the important role}} of the outer-edge flame on flame extinction through experimental and numerical analyses. It explores flame stability diagrams mapping the flame extinction response of nitrogen-diluted non-premixed counterflow flames to varying global strain rates in terms of burner diameter, burner gap, and velocity ratio. A critical nitrogen mole fraction exists beyond which the flame cannot be sustained; the critical nitrogen mole fraction versus global strain rate curves have C-shapes for various burner diameters, burner gaps, and velocity ratios. At sufficiently high strain-rate flames, these curves collapse into one curve; therefore, the flames follow the one-dimensional flame response of a typical diffusion flame. Low strain-rate flames are significantly affected by radial conductive heat loss, and therefore flame length. Three flame extinction modes are identified: flame extinction <b>through</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of the outer-edge flame with or without oscillations at the outer-edge flame prior to the extinction, and flame extinction through a flame hole at the flame center. The extinction modes are significantly affected by the behavior of the outer-edge flame. Detailed explanations are provided based on the measured flame-surface temperature and numerical evaluation of the fractional contribution of each term in the energy equation. Radial conductive heat loss at the flame edge to ambience is the main mechanism of extinction <b>through</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of the outer-edge flame in low strain-rate flames. Reduction of the burner diameter can extend the flame extinction mode by shrinking the outer-edge flame in higher strain-rate flames. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

This allows us to indirectly estimate the regression coefficient matrix <b>through</b> <b>shrinkage</b> estimation of the parameters of the inverse regression, or the conditional distribution of the predictors given the responses. We establish a convergence rate bound for estimators in our class and we study two examples.

The second example estimator exploits an assumption that the inverse regression's coefficient matrix is rank deficient. These estimators do not require the popular assumption that the forward regression coefficient matrix is sparse or has small Frobenius norm.

40|$|Motivation: High-dimensional data such as microarrays {{have created}} new {{challenges}} to traditional statistical methods. One such example is on class prediction with high-dimension, low-sample size data. Due {{to the small}} sample size, the sample mean estimates are usually unreliable. As a consequence, {{the performance of the}} class prediction methods using the sample mean may also be unsatisfactory. To obtain more accurate estimation of parameters some statistical methods, such as regularizations <b>through</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> are often desired. Results: In this article, we investigate the family of shrinkage estimators for the mean value under the quadratic loss function. The optimal shrinkage parameter is proposed under the scenario when the sample size is fixed and the dimension is large. We then construct a shrinkage-based diagonal discriminant rule by replacing the sample mean by the proposed shrinkage mean. Finally, we demonstrate via simulation studies and real data analysis that the proposed shrinkage-based rule outperforms its original competitor {{in a wide range of}} settings...|$|R
40|$|The Bayesian CART (classification and {{regression}} tree) approach {{proposed by}} Chipman, George and McCulloch (1998) entails putting a prior distribution {{on the set}} of all CART models and then using stochastic search to select a model. The main thrust {{of this paper is to}} propose a new class of hierarchical priors which enhance the potential of this Bayesian approach. These priors indicate a preference for smooth local mean structure, resulting in tree models which shrink predictions from adjacent terminal node towards each other. Past methods for tree shrinkage have searched for trees without shrinking, and applied shrinkage to the identified tree only after the search. By using hierarchical priors in the stochastic search, the proposed method searches for shrunk trees that fit well and afterwards improves the tree <b>through</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of predictions.
