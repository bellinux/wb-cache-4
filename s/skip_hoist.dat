50|$|Q-11 was {{received}} in 55-gallon drums. The drums were deheaded before processing and were conveyed through a thawing tunnel, which also provided surge capacity of deheaded drums. The drums were lifted {{to the top}} of the building by a <b>skip</b> <b>hoist</b> where they were emptied into a surge hopper that feeds the magnetic separator and jaw crusher. From the jaw crusher, the one-half inch material passes through a rotary drum dryer to a system of conveyors, which conveys the material to a surge hopper that feeds the ring roll mill. The particle size output from the mill was controlled to about 100 mesh by an air classifier mounted directly on the mill. The undersized material was blown to a cyclone separator that was mounted directly above the first Gallagher sampler. The three Gallagher samplers in series each took a 10% cut of the stream fed to it, producing a sample approximately 0.1% of the original lot size. The main stream was conveyed to a drumming station where it was packaged in 55-gallon or 30-gallon drums for use in the Refinery. The official weight was taken at this point.|$|E
50|$|In 1904, Heyl & Patterson {{pioneered the}} first cranes to lift entire {{railroad}} cars, {{as well as}} towers to unload barges filled with ore, coal, sand, and slag. 1905 saw the introduction of coal crushers, coke preparation plants, coal handling bridges and mine car dumpers. 1908 saw the first <b>skip</b> <b>hoists</b> and ore bridges to transfer material at steel mills.|$|R
2500|$|James Simpson, {{president}} of Marshall Field & Co. from 1923 to 1930 {{and chairman of}} the Chicago Plan Commission from 1926 to 1935, turned the first shovels of dirt at groundbreaking on August 16, 1928, along with architect Ernest Graham. [...] General contractor John W. Griffiths & Sons brought building construction into the machine age through the use of techniques [...] "ordinarily used in the construction of big dams." [...] Cement arriving by boat was lifted by compressed air to bins [...] above the ground, with gravel and sand delivered by railroad cars to conveyor belts and transfer elevators. Giant mixers provided wet concrete to <b>skip</b> <b>hoists</b> in vertical towers that were extended as the building rose. Continuously employing 2,500 men and as many as 5,700 men altogether, the construction project lasted {{a year and a half}} into the early months of the Great Depression. [...] With a foundation footprint of nearly two square city blocks, the building required 29 million bricks, [...] of plumbing, [...] of wiring, nearly [...] of concrete, [...] of stone, and 4,000 windows. [...] Bethlehem Steel fabricated much of the 60,000 tons of steel. [...] An estimated [...] of corridors and over 30 elevators were included in the construction.|$|R
50|$|Blasting {{breaks the}} salt into {{manageable}} pieces, which are conveyed to crushers and removedto the surface through the shaft with large buckets on the hoist. The mine elevator {{is called the}} “skip” in the mining industry. Fully loaded it carries four tons of salt and makes a round trip every three minutes. This loaded <b>skip</b> is <b>hoisted</b> to the top electrically by a wire rope with jute core, and is used to transport miners {{to and from the}} mine as well as bring the mined salt topside.Because of the impurities (mostly shale and anhydrite), rock salt is used primarily as road salt.|$|R
50|$|The second {{compartment}} is {{used for}} one or more <b>skips,</b> used to <b>hoist</b> ore to the surface. Smaller mining operations use a skip mounted underneath the cage, rather than a separate device, while some large mines have separate shafts for the cage and skips. The third compartment {{is used for}} an emergency exit; it may house an auxiliary cage or a system of ladders. An additional compartment houses mine services such as high voltage cables and pipes for transfer of water, compressed air or diesel fuel.|$|R
50|$|Broken ore is {{delivered}} {{to one of}} five underground crushers and reduced in size to less than 150mm before being carried by conveyor to a 3,600t capacity storage bin of {{at the base of}} the production shaft. <b>Skip</b> loading and <b>hoisting</b> are automatic. Ore is supplied, at an hourly rate of 570 tonnes, to the surface coarse ore storage building, with a 30,000t capacity, known as the Tepee. The concentrates are shipped via Dublin Port to Boliden's smelters in Kokkola, Finland and Odda, Norway and to other smelters throughout Europe. Tara Mines is connected by railway to Drogheda via Navan, where daily loads of ore are sent to Dublin port.|$|R
