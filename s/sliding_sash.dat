500|$|Built in 1818, the Gurdon Bill Store is a [...] by [...] -story clapboarded store. The {{walls extend}} higher up than the ceiling to an attic for {{additional}} storage space. The wood-shingled gable roof {{also has a}} smaller pent roof on the front facade that projects about [...] beyond the wall, which is unusual in New England architecture. The foundation of the store is built upon fieldstone and has stone blocks above the ground; the store has a full cellar. The main facade has two large twelve-by-twelve light <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> windows {{on the left side}} that can be covered with three-part batten shutters. The main door is a Dutch door with a plain frame and to its right is a smaller six-by-six sash window without a batten shutter. The rear facade is plain and devoid of any windows. The north end of has four windows, two for the attic, and the south end has only two windows for the attic, all with six-over-six sash.|$|E
2500|$|A {{workshop}} {{and some other}} associated structures surround the lighthouse. The residences at the station consist of two one-story lighthouse keeper's houses flanking the lighthouse, one for the head keeper {{and one for the}} assistant keeper. They are timber framed and fibro clad, with timber cover battens and timber door and window frames. Windows have a fixed upper pane with <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> below and louvers. Near the residences are a fowl yard and a shelter. A group of service buildings, including a power house, a garage and bulk fuel store are located about [...] southeast of the lighthouse. The workshop, office and garage are timber framed with painted fibro cement and cover battens, and were all built with the residences. The more recent power house and inflammable liquid store are constructed of bricks and have a concrete foundation, a hipped stainless steel roof, with central vent and metal door and window frames.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} of the cabin is partitioned into three rooms. [...] The interior petitions are made of peeled stacked logs with mortar chinking between logs. [...] The front room (office) is at north end of building. The bedroom takes up the southwest quarter and the kitchen is in the southeast quarter. [...] A steel cable connects the two long walls to keep the winter snow load from forcing {{the sides of the}} cabin apart. [...] The floor is covered with [...] tongue-and-groove fir planks. [...] The cabin has three doors: a front door facing west, a back door facing east, and a kitchen door facing south. [...] The office has two casement windows. [...] The bedroom and kitchen each have two horizontal <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> windows. [...] The kitchen has built-in knotty pine cupboards and the bedroom has a built-in knotty pine dresser. [...] The bedroom also has a built-in closet with knotty pine doors. [...] The ceiling is covered with -wide tongue-and-groove fir boards.|$|E
5000|$|Late C18 house, altered C19. Plastered brick, {{with red}} plain tile roof.Two storeys. Four window range double hung {{vertical}} <b>sliding</b> <b>sashes</b> withglazing bars. Two C19 ground floor bays, western one now main entrance ...|$|R
50|$|The {{front of}} the hall is symmetrical, {{featuring}} a gable with a bargeboard supported by decorative timber brackets. The entrance is central, sheltered under a gable roofed porch. A flagpole stands near the front, centred on the elevation. Either side of the front porch are windows with decorative timber hoods. These have modern aluminium- framed <b>sliding</b> <b>sashes</b> below original timber-framed fanlights.|$|R
50|$|The 1874 {{building}} {{has been extended}} to the north with a brick store building (before 1929), a timber infants' room built over a basement room (before 1959) and a new passage and classroom built in 1959 with a newly fitted out manual training room and laundry underneath. The 1959 extension has face brickwork foundations, and is sheeted in weatherboards with hopper windows replacing the earlier <b>sliding</b> <b>sashes,</b> and has a corrugated GI roof.|$|R
5000|$|... {{reinstatement}} {{of painted}} timber windows {{to the original}} design. These will in most, but not all cases be vertical <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> windows ...|$|E
50|$|The front (west) {{elevation}} comprises a two-storeyed decorative gable {{structure with}} asymmetric single-storeyed wing walls to the side. The ground floor and wing walls are of rendered masonry construction, {{while the first}} storey decorative gable is formed in pressed metal sheeting over timber. The ground floor has a centrally placed open entrance, over which is a cantilevered awning with pressed metal detailing. There are two symmetrically placed windows with decorative architraves. The window {{on the south side}} is a 6:9 pane timber vertical <b>sliding</b> <b>sash,</b> the window on the north side is a 6:1 pane timber vertical <b>sliding</b> <b>sash.</b> The side wing walls are terminated by a pilaster with a decorative cap. The north wall which has a pair of vertical timber doors, acts purely as a screen wall with no building behind. The south wall has a 6:4 pane timber vertical <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> window and a timber door giving access to a store room.|$|E
50|$|The {{house has}} timber <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> windows and timber doors. The street entry door has stained glass set in timber surrounds. The house {{contains}} some fine pressed metal wall and ceiling sheeting.|$|E
50|$|All {{four sides}} of the two-storeyed section show cross-plates with tie rods {{stabilising}} the upper level. Windows {{to the side and}} rear elevations are vertical <b>sliding</b> <b>sashes</b> with projecting stone sills. To the rear is a single-storey skillion wing of stone with a recess clad in weatherboards for a back door and windows. There is a later single-storeyed extension running perpendicular to the remainder, built of rendered masonry and weatherboards with a hipped corrugated steel roof.|$|R
5000|$|English Heritage {{note that}} in the {{original}} building (the unexpanded pub), the lower bars, named the [...] "Snug" [...] and [...] "Committee Room" [...] respectively contain 1930s fireplaces and matchboard panelling, and that between these two areas lies a central bar, which is enclosed by <b>sliding</b> <b>sashes</b> with glazing bars, and are [...] "perhaps a mixture of late C18 and 1930s work". Behind this lies a circa 1700 dog-leg stairway [...] "with turned balusters on a closed string".|$|R
60|$|Every {{fitting that}} could be pried or screwed out was gone. Port, starboard, and {{masthead}} lights; teak gratings; <b>sliding</b> <b>sashes</b> of the deckhouse; the captain's chest of drawers, with charts and chart-table; photographs, brackets, and looking-glasses; cabin doors; rubber cuddy mats; hatch-irons; half the funnel-stays; cork fenders; carpenter's grindstone and tool-chest; holystones, swabs, squeegees; all cabin and pantry lamps; galley-fittings en bloc; flags and flag-locker; clocks, chronometers; the forward compass and the ship's bell and belfry, were among the missing.|$|R
50|$|The hotel {{contains}} two {{bars on the}} ground floor, and accommodation upstairs. The principal bar, which is entered from the street corner, displays evidence of having once been two rooms, with an original timber archway and new post and beam replacing the wall. The bar has French doors and <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> windows, and arched <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> windows {{either side of the}} corner entrance. The entry vestibule to the upstairs accommodation to the south of the bar has a decorative arch above the foot of the timber stairs. The stairs have a carved balustrade, and a stained glass window at the half-landing.|$|E
50|$|A single-hung {{sash window}} {{is a window}} that has one sash that is movable (usually the bottom one) and the other fixed. This is the earlier form of <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> window, and is also cheaper.|$|E
50|$|A {{horizontal}} <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> window has {{two or more}} sashes that overlap slightly but slide horizontally {{within the}} frame. In the UK, these are sometimes called Yorkshire sash windows, presumably because of their traditional use in that county.|$|E
50|$|By July 1927 {{the number}} of {{patients}} attending the clinic for treatment had increased and accommodation was insufficient. The front verandah was enclosed with asbestos cement sheeting and venetian blinds for more room. In the same year the rear verandah was enclosed with <b>sliding</b> <b>sashes</b> to form a bedroom for the Superintendent Nurse and her previous room was converted to an office. With increased staff numbers, the rear verandah on the ground floor was enclosed with sashes to form a dining room. In 1928 a portion of the ground floor, front verandah was enclosed with sashes to give mothers and their babies' greater privacy from the street.|$|R
5000|$|The street {{elevation}} {{at ground}} level has three separate entries and windows. To the western end is a four-panelled door with tilting fanlight beside a small vertical <b>sliding</b> <b>sashed</b> window. To the centre is a similar door, with [...] "Plumb's Chambers" [...] painted to the fanlight, {{and a group of}} three windows beside. To the eastern end is a timber shopfront which angles back to the recessed entry of panelled French doors. The underside of the verandah is of ripple iron with internal gutters and a moulded plaster cornice at the wall. The verandah is accessed at the upper level by four pairs of glazed French doors. Only the stonework to this street elevation has been painted.|$|R
50|$|Open-air annexes {{proved to}} be {{inadequate}} and were discontinued in 1923, although many had been constructed across Queensland in 10 years. The open sides provided limited weather protection, better climate control was needed, and the canvas blinds deteriorated quickly. All open-air annexes in Queensland were modified to provide better enclosure. By 1929 the open-air annexe at Toowoomba was enclosed; the blinds were replaced with casement windows. A small, semi-detached extension with a hipped roof {{was added to the}} centre of the western verandah accommodating a teacher's room at the classroom level and a store room underneath. In 1930 the western verandah was enclosed with <b>sliding</b> <b>sashes</b> and the balustrade was replaced by cement sheet. After its enclosure, minimal alterations of the open-air annexe at Toowoomba were made over time.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is significant as a substantially intact, small rural school {{building of the}} early 20th century. Evidence of its early open-air form remains in the extant <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> windows which replaced the original canvas blinds in 1924.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{is supported by}} a steel frame, with socle (plinth) of dressed granite, marble columns and plastered brickwork. The roof is pitched, which distinguishes it from the multitude of later, taller buildings which had flat concrete roof construction. Timber-framed <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> windows provide elegant fenestration.|$|E
50|$|The {{classrooms}} {{are lined}} and rendered internally, and have sheeted ceilings. All the classrooms are accessed {{from both sides}} via timber double doors. The rooms have two types of grided timber windows; paired <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> windows, and high-set grided timber windows with an inward tilting panel.|$|E
50|$|The 1934 police {{residence}} is also clad in weatherboard and highset {{on concrete}} perimeter posts, {{with the same}} window hoods and casement windows as the court house. Its L-shaped veranda has been enclosed. A front gable contains the office, reached by side stairs leading to projecting gabled portico. A rear gable contains the kitchen. The original design contained three bedrooms and a living room, and an enclosed veranda with <b>sliding</b> <b>sashes</b> between the kitchen and bathroom {{at the rear of}} the house, but we were unable to inspect the current interior. Front and rear stairs rise parallel to the house, leading to the front veranda and rear door, respectively. Externally, apart from the enclosed verandas, the removal of the 1000-gallon water tanks, and the angle of the stairs to the office, it closely resembles the original 1932 architect's plans.|$|R
50|$|The {{rear and}} side {{boundary}} walls, constructed of a concrete frame with contrasting dark brown brick infill balustrading and parapet, form the outer verandah walls. The verandahs are enclosed with windows (both early timber casement and later <b>sliding</b> aluminium <b>sashes).</b> The northern corner {{at the rear}} of the hotel projects forward and above the parapet and has a decorative rendered cornice.|$|R
50|$|Susan Roundtree {{notes that}} the houses were {{probably}} built by tradesmen rather than skilled craftsmen. Three bay houses were soon joined by smaller, two-bay houses that were effectively miniature versions of the city houses with two principal rooms on each floor. The basement walls are about two feet thick, with limestone calp used throughout. The windows were typical vertically <b>sliding</b> timber <b>sashes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} features two timber staircases, {{which have}} timber balustrades with turned newels with rounded terminals. The windows are <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> with grided panes {{to the upper}} leaves, excluding those to the verandahs and toilet bay. The verandahs are accessed with timber double doors with fanlights.|$|E
50|$|The {{house was}} {{originally}} built for Bonham and Elizabeth Hayes, successful {{farmers in the}} Cobham area.The red-brick Kentish Yeoman's house is symmetrical, two storeys high, with <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> and dormer windows. The house interiors date in part to 1684, and include a remarkably ornate Carolean plasterwork ceiling above the prinicpal staircase.|$|E
50|$|The {{upper level}} has glazed timber French doors leading onto the verandah, {{the lower level}} has timber <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> windows and timber doors. The {{sandstone}} is square-snecked coursed, and has been recently repointed. The north-west {{corner of the house}} has a corrugated iron wash house incorporated into the base of a water tank on tall timber stumps.|$|E
50|$|A notice {{displayed}} at the entrance states that the building was built by William Chimney in 1480. This detached two-storey building, close to the church, is the other Grade II* listed building in the parish. and is timber framed tudor period with 19th and 20th century extensions, plastered, roofed with handmade red clay tiles, an inside wall has a Victorian chimney stack. Two plain boarded doors form the entrance, on which side windows have horizontally <b>sliding</b> <b>sashes</b> of 16 panes, four on both floors, and one C20 casement window on first floor. Facing the church are two small 20th century casement windows, whereas the first floor has four 19th century neo-gothic cast-iron casement windows. Some framing remains exposed internally. On ground floor, at the NW end a stairway rises from one external door to the first floor. At the SE end an original studded partition separates one bay from the remainder — the main section is open.|$|R
50|$|A single-hung window has two sashes, but {{normally}} the top sash is fixed {{and only the}} bottom <b>sash</b> <b>slides.</b> Triple- and quadruple-hung windows are used for tall openings, common in New England churches.|$|R
60|$|It {{became evident}} the clerk had broken a window, {{and then it}} seemed he had leapt a vast {{distance}} sideways, and there came the noise of a window-frame <b>sliding</b> in its <b>sash.</b> He was bawling things.|$|R
50|$|The house {{comprises}} {{a picturesque}} composition of steep, decorated gables, encircled by verandahs. To the north, {{the line of}} the verandah roof is broken by an entry portico with a hipped roof. The residence is lined with deep chamferboard, has <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> windows, and sits on a brick base. The verandah has a gently curved corrugated roof, and cast iron valances and balustrades.|$|E
50|$|Further {{dendrochronology}} {{performed in}} the roof structure indicated that significant changes {{were made to the}} building between 1767 and 1768. These changes include; extending the dwelling on the east by 6 ft and on the west by 12 ft, extending the loft to a full story across the south facade only, the addition of two outward flanking chimney stacks, encasing the south facing facade with brick nogging and a veneer brick, adding 16/16 common <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> windows of the first floor and 9/9 common <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> windows on the second floor. The veneer brick and addition of solid masonry were set in an artful Flemish bond pattern with glazed headers, queen course and oyster shell lime mortar with a grapevine joint. During this expansion it is assumed that the northward ell was not modified, however this portion of the building was removed in a subsequent renovation likely to have occurred circa 1897.|$|E
50|$|By mid-1918, {{the canvas}} blinds, {{which had no}} springs but used a weight, {{controlled}} by a rope, as counterpoise, were already causing problems. In 1924 these were replaced with the present <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> windows; the large canvas door at the front was replaced by vertically jointed timber to match the original walling; and the present entrance, {{at the side of}} the building, was filled in and a wooden door installed.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{has evolved from}} an open sided kiosk, and the main section is formed by two adjoining similar kiosk structures, with a two-storeyed service wing to the rear and an addition to the northeast. The kiosk section has <b>sliding</b> multi-paned <b>sash</b> windows which can be concealed within the solid balustrade below, and multi-paned fanlight glazing above. The balustrade has fibrous cement panels with timber mouldings. The service wing and northeast addition have weatherboard cladding, with a brick base to the northeast.|$|R
50|$|Jalousie windows {{maximise}} {{natural ventilation}} by allowing airflow {{through the entire}} window area. Historically made only of wooden slats or glass panes, they are well suited to mild-winter climates. With mass production they became very common throughout homes in mid-20th-century Florida, Hawaii, southern California, the deep South, and Latin America. In cooler regions they were rapidly adopted to porches and sunrooms. They were also widely used in mobile homes during the 1950s and 1960s before most manufacturers began switching to <b>sliding</b> and <b>sash</b> windows in subsequent decades.|$|R
50|$|Open-air {{schooling}} {{had been}} experimented with {{around the turn}} of the century in England and Germany, and in the 1910s was promoted in Queensland by Dr Eleanor Bourne, Director of the Department of Public Instruction's School Medical Service from 1912. A recent study has identified 138 open-air schools constructed in Queensland between 1914 and 1922, with the bulk erected in 1915-16. Approximately 25% of these structures were constructed as annexes to established schools, but most were erected in sparsely settled districts as the only school building. They were comparatively inexpensive to construct, and were considered appropriate in areas unlikely to grow in population, or to transient mining or railway communities. Within a few years, the climatic disadvantages of these open-air schools, particularly those like the Urangan Point School, which had no verandahs, became apparent. When the canvas blinds were drawn against rain or wind, the schoolroom became dark and stuffy, and teaching was almost impossible. The canvas blinds were damaged easily, and required constant attention. They offered no resistance to intruders, and straying or native animals could not be kept out. In the early 1920s, all of the open-air buildings were enclosed with <b>sliding</b> <b>sashes,</b> timber walling and timber doors.|$|R
