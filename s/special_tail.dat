50|$|There {{are a few}} {{classical}} {{cases where}} this favourable response was not achieved, notably some early T-tail jet aircraft. In {{the event of a}} very high angle of attack, the horizontal stabilizer became immersed in downwash from the wing and fuselage, causing excessive download on the stabilizer, increasing the angle of attack still further. The only way an aircraft could recover from this situation was by jettisoning tail ballast or deploying a <b>special</b> <b>tail</b> parachute. The phenomenon became known as 'deep stall'.|$|E

50|$|Overall, the {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to previous 8-bit Sonic games, though the game allowed players to engage {{for the first time}} as either Sonic or Tails. For the first time in the 8-bit series, the player may perform the Spin Dash introduced in the 16-bit version of Sonic 2. By holding up and pressing buttons, Sonic can perform the Super Peel-out introduced in Sonic CD, while Tails is able to fly, this being the first game in which he may do so. While playing as Sonic, players can collect rocket boots which allow him to fly through the air for a short time. He is also able to enter <b>Special</b> Stages. <b>Tails</b> is slower than Sonic and can't enter Special Stages or use rocket boots, but he starts the game with more lives and continues.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, tail call {{elimination}} is optional. However, in {{functional programming}} languages, tail call elimination is often {{guaranteed by the}} language standard, allowing tail recursion to use a similar amount of memory as an equivalent loop. The <b>special</b> case of <b>tail</b> recursive calls, when a function calls itself, may be more amenable to call elimination than general tail calls. When the language semantics do not explicitly support general tail calls, a compiler can often still optimize sibling calls, or tail calls to functions which take and return the same types as the caller.|$|R
50|$|Sonic, {{who drives}} {{a red and}} white sports car known as the Cyclone, has great speed and {{handling}} but poor control, and has a speed boost as his <b>Special</b> Ability. <b>Tails,</b> who drives a 1960s-era Formula 1 car called the MTP-01 Wheelwind, is well-balanced {{in terms of his}} speed, acceleration and handling, but does not stand out in any particular area- he can utilize a powerful jump as his Special Ability, which allows him to avoid obstacles and particularly tough corners. Eggman (as he is referred to in this game), who pilots a modified version of his standard Eggmobile known as the Egg Typhoon, has poor acceleration, but has very high top speed and cornering abilities, and can toss Bombs onto the track that can cause his rivals to spin out. Finally, Amy Rose, who drives a yellow and blue vintage convertible called the Breeze, has great acceleration at the cost of low top speed, and has the ability to attack by throwing small heart-shaped objects that slow down her opponents and alter their controls for a short time.|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} by the aerodynamic staff of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics for the purpose of studying experimentally the longitudinal dynamic stability of airplanes in flight. The airplanes selected for this purpose were a standard rigged VE- 7 advanced-training airplane and a JN 4 H with <b>special</b> <b>tail</b> surfaces. The airplanes were caused to oscillate by means of the elevator, then the longitudinal control was either locked or kept free while the oscillation died out. The magnitude of the oscillation was recorded either by a kymograph or an airspeed meter. The results show that the engine speed has as much effect on the period and damping as the airspeed, and that, contrary to theory as developed for small oscillations, the damping decreased at the higher airspeeds with closed throttle...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we argue for a special case of the {{generalized}} hyperbolic (GH) family that we denote as the GH skew Student's t-distribution. This distribution has the important property that one tail has polynomial and the other exponential behavior. Further, {{it is the only}} subclass of the GH family of distributions having this property. Although the GH skew Student's t-distribution has been previously proposed in the literature, it is not well known, and specifically, its <b>special</b> <b>tail</b> behavior has not been addressed. This article presents empirical evidence of exponential/polynomial tail behavior in skew financial data, and demonstrates the superiority of the GH skew Student's t-distribution with respect to data fit compared with some of its competitors. Through VaR and expected shortfall calculations we show why the exponential/polynomial tail behavior is important in practice. Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
50|$|In {{build the}} body and tail are only {{moderately}} plump, roughly cylindrical without <b>special</b> frills. The <b>tail</b> tapers to a point, but as is common among geckos, it commonly has been partly shed {{by the time the}} animal is fully grown, and the distal part commonly is a regenerated replacement. The animal is of modest size for a gecko, typically 50-60 mm in body length. The head plus tail add about a similar length, so that a typical specimen might measure roughly 100-120 mm. As in most geckos, the tail commonly is swollen with fat stores, but not as much so as most species, such as say, in the genera Chondrodactylus and Pachydactylus.|$|R

40|$|Although many viruses are {{icosahedral}} {{when they}} initially bind {{to one or}} more receptor molecules on the cell surface, such an interaction is asymmetric, probably causing a breakdown in the symmetry and conformation of the original infecting virion in preparation for membrane penetration and release of the viral genome. Cryoelectron microscopy and biochemical analyses show that transferrin receptor, the cellular receptor for canine parvovirus, can bind to only one or a few of the 60 icosahedrally equivalent sites on the virion, indicating that either canine parvovirus has inherent asymmetry or binding of receptor induces asymmetry. The asymmetry of receptor binding to canine parvovirus is reminiscent of the <b>special</b> portal in <b>tailed</b> bacteriophages and some large, icosahedral viruses. Asymmetric interactions of icosahedral viruses with their hosts might be a more common phenomenon than previously thought and may have been obscured by averaging in previous crystallographic and electron microscopic structure determinations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We study {{fundamental}} spectral {{properties of}} random block operators {{that are common}} in the physical modelling of meso-scopic disordered systems such as dirty superconductors. Our re-sults include ergodic properties, {{the location of the}} spectrum, ex-istence and regularity of the integrated density of states, as well as Lifshits <b>tails.</b> <b>Special</b> attention is paid to the peculiarities arising from the block structure such as the occurrence of a robust gap {{in the middle of the}} spectrum. Without randomness in the off-diagonal blocks the density of states typically exhibits an inverse square-root singularity at the edges of the gap. In the presence of randomness we establish a Wegner estimate that is valid at all energies. It implies that the singularities are smeared out by ran-domness, and the density of states is bounded. We also show Lif-shits tails at these band edges. Technically, one has to cope with a non-monotone dependence on the random couplings. 1...|$|R

40|$|The costly {{lessons from}} global {{crisis in the}} past decade {{reinforce}} the importance as well as challenges of risk management. This thesis explores several core concepts of quantitative risk management and provides further insight. We start with rating migration risk and propose a Mixture of Markov Chains (MMC) model to account for stochastic business cycle effects in credit rating migration risk. The model shows superior in-sample estimation and out-of-sample predication than its rivals. Compared with the naive approach the economic application suggests banks with MMC estimator will increase capital requirement in economic expansion and free up capital during recession hence it is aligned with Basel III macroprudential imitative by reducing the recession-vs-expansion gap in capital buffers. Subsequently we move to the key concept of dependence by investigating the importance of dynamic linkages between credit and equity markets. We propose a flexible regime-switching copula model to explore the dynamics of dependence and possible structure breaks with <b>special</b> consideration on <b>tail</b> dependence. The study reveals a high-dependence regime that coincides with the recent financial crisis. The backtesting results acknowledge the new model's superiority on out-of-sample VaR forecasting over purely dynamic or static copula. It can serve to emphasise the relevance for risk management of appropriately modeling complex dependence structures. Finally we discuss the risk measures and how they affect the portfolio optimisation. We contend that more successful portfolio management can be achieved by combining extreme value analysis to describe downside tail risk and dynamic copulas to model nonlinear dependence structures. Conditional Value-at-Risk is adopted as pertinent measure of downside tail risk for portfolio optimisation. Using both realised portfolio returns and a set of out-of-sample Monte Carlo experiments, our novel portfolio strategy is confronted with the de facto mean-variance approach. The results suggest that the MV approach produces suboptimal portfolios or a less desirable risk-return tradeoff...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{at least}} eleven {{variants}} of the 917. The original version had a removable long tail/medium tail with active rear wing flaps, but had considerable handling problems at high speed because of significant rear lift. The handling problems were investigated at a joint test at the Österreichring by the factory engineers and their new race team partners John Wyer Engineering and after exhaustive experimentation by both groups, a shorter, more upswept tail was found to give the car more aerodynamic stability at speed. The changes were quickly adopted into {{a new version of}} the 917, called the Kurzheck, or short-tail, with the new version being called the 917K. The 917K, and the special Le Mans long-tail version (called the 917 Langheck, or 917L), dominated the 1970 and 1971 World Sportscar Championships. In 1971, a variant of the 917K appeared with a less upswept tail and vertical fins, and featured the concave rear deck that had proved so effective on the 1970 version of the 917L (see below). The fins kept the clean downforce inducing air on the top of the tail and allowed the angle of the deck to be reduced, reducing the drag in direct proportion. The result was a more attractive looking car that maintained down force for less drag and higher top speed. By this time the original 4.5-litre engine, which had produced around 520 bhp in 1969, had been enlarged through 4.9-litres (600 bhp) to 5-litres and produced a maximum of 630 bhp. The 917K models were generally used for the shorter road courses such as Sebring, Brands Hatch, Monza and Spa-Francorchamps. The big prize for Porsche however, was Le Mans. For the French circuit's long, high speed straights, the factory developed <b>special</b> long <b>tail</b> bodywork that was designed for minimum drag and thus highest maximum speed. On the car's debut in 1969, these long-tail (917L) models proved to be nearly uncontrollable as there was so little down force. In fact, they generated aerodynamic lift at the highest speeds. For 1970, an improved version was raced by the factory (although the John Wyer team still preferred the security of the 917K) and for 1971, after very significant development in the wind tunnel, the definitive 917L was raced by both factory and JW. These cars were so stable that the drivers could take their hands off the steering wheel at speeds which reached 246 mph.In 1971 Jo Siffert raced an open-top 917PA Spyder (normally aspirated) in the 1971 CanAm series. [...] There is also the [...] "Pink Pig" [...] aerodynamic research version (917/20), and the turbocharged 917/10 and 917/30 CanAm Spyders.
