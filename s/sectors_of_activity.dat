5|$|Most of humanity's oldest known archaeological constructions are tombs. Mostly megalithic, the {{earliest}} instances date {{to within a}} few centuries of each other, yet show a wide diversity of form and purpose. Tombs in the Iberian peninsula have been dated through thermoluminescence to c. 4510BCE, and some burials at the Carnac stones in Brittany also {{date back to the}} fifth millennium BCE. The commemorative value of such burial sites are indicated by the fact that, at some stage, they became elevated, and that the constructs, almost from {{the earliest}}, sought to be monumental. This effect was often achieved by encapsulating a single corpse in a basic pit, surrounded by an elaborate ditch and drain. Over-ground commemoration is thought to be tied to the concept of collective memory, and these early tombs were likely intended as a form of ancestor-worship, a development available only to communities that had advanced to the stage of settled livestock and formed social roles and relationships and specialized <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Paris Region had 5.4 million {{salaried}} {{employees in}} 2010, of whom 2.2 million were concentrated in 39 pôles d'emplois or business districts. The largest of these, {{in terms of}} number of employees, is known in French as the QCA, or quartier central des affaires; {{it is in the}} western part of the City of Paris, in the 2nd, 8th, 9th, 16th, and 18th arrondissements. In 2010, it was the workplace of 500,000 salaried employees, about thirty percent of the salaried employees in Paris and ten percent of those in the Île-de-France. The largest <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> in the central business district were finance and insurance (16 percent of employees in the district) and business services (15 percent). The district also includes a large concentration of department stores, shopping areas, hotels and restaurants, as well a government offices and ministries.|$|E
30|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} concerning {{the variability of}} the continuity and survival of businesses by force or not the industry, we operationalized the Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon two sample groups (1 [*]=[*]life Of a force in the <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> 0 [*]=[*]absence <b>of</b> a force in the <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity).</b> The goal {{is to determine the}} extent to which the survival of firms changes according to the strength of the industry. The rank test by industry shows that the mean score for the sample of the presence of force in the industry is 28.14, while that of the absence sample <b>of</b> <b>sector</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> is 24.58. The result of the Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon equal scores is significant at the 10 % level (p[*]<[*] 0.088). This reflecting the continuity and survival of businesses change depending on the strength of the industry. We only conclude the <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> with significant assessments on the continuity and survival of the newly created companies.|$|R

40|$|Even if {{franchising}} is now everywhere, {{there are}} still some differences, for instance according to the geographic area or according to the <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities.</b> Several multi-countries studies have already highlighted some of these differences. Nevertheless, as far as the <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> is concerned, researchers have not focused on the differences between different kinds of networks. In this paper, I focus on the differences between services and retail networks in terms of age, size, plural form, internationalization, and contracts terms. The empirical study concerns more than 500 networks located in the French territory. Results could help the prospective franchisees to better understand these two kinds of networks before choosing one particular <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities,</b> and the franchisors to take into account these differences in the creation and management of his/her network...|$|R

2500|$|Originally {{established}} on 4 June 1893 by Charles I {{during his visit}} to the city of Beja as the [...] "Civil Order of Agricultural and Industrial Merit", the order was abolished with the founding of the Portuguese republic and reformulated in 1926. In 1991, it was renamed the [...] "Order of Agricultural, Industrial and Commercial Merit" [...] following the addition of a third class to recognise services rendered in connection with the trade and service sectors. Following legislation in 2011, the order received its present name, maintaining the three existing classes but extending the granting of the Commercial Class of Merit to the important tourism sector.

30|$|A further look to Table  2 {{reveals a}} {{positive}} {{relation between the}} unemployment rate <b>of</b> the <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> the economy and entries into the disability system although the coefficient is not significant. Therefore, {{when there is a}} negative economic situation in the <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> in which the individual works, he has a higher probability of joining the disability rolls. In particular, we estimate that for a unit increase in the unemployment rate <b>of</b> the <b>sector,</b> the relative risk of entering the disability rolls increases by a factor of 1.003 and our model predicts that the probability of going to disability benefits increases by 0.30 % when the unemployment rate <b>of</b> the <b>sector</b> changes from the minimum to the maximum in our sample (0.1 versus 14.7). Both the unemployment rate <b>of</b> the <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> and the unemployment rate of the autonomous community appear to be non-significant in our specifications because their effect is already captured by the dummy variables of the region and the <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b> Both unemployment rates appear to be significant when we estimate the model without the dummies for autonomous community and <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b> However, we have included them in the model because we wanted to test whether there is a time-variant effect at the regional and sector level apart from the fixed-effect captured by the dummies.|$|R

The results indicate that unemployment in different <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> economic <b>activity</b> responds differently to various {{macroeconomic policy}} shocks. © 2009 M. E. Sharpe, Inc.
