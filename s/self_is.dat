5|$|The {{significance}} of Ahimsa {{as the very}} first restraint {{in the very first}} limb of Yoga (Yamas), is that it defines the necessary foundation for progress through Yoga. It is a precursor to Asana, implying that success in Yogasana can be had only if the <b>self</b> <b>is</b> purified in thought, word and deed through the self-restraint of Ahimsa.|$|E
5|$|Rigveda, however, {{does not}} {{describe}} yoga {{and there is}} little evidence as to what the practices were. Early references to practices that later became part of yoga, are made in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the earliest Hindu Upanishad. For example, the practice of pranayama (consciously regulating breath) is mentioned in hymn 1.5.23 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (c. 900 BCE), and the practice of pratyahara (concentrating all of one's senses on <b>self)</b> <b>is</b> mentioned in hymn 8.15 of Chandogya Upanishad (c. 800–700 BCE).|$|E

5|$|The {{whole point}} is that we are the song. The <b>self</b> <b>is</b> coming from a state of pure awareness, from the state of being. All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the {{physical}} world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and {{about the quality of the}} transcendent.|$|E
5|$|A salient {{feature of}} Buddhist {{philosophy}} which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is {{the centrality of}} the doctrine of not-self (Pāli. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the <b>self</b> <b>is</b> merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous {{way of looking at the}} ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors. The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising (pratītyasamutpāda). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both causal determinist and epiphenomenalist conceptions of mind.|$|E
5|$|Description of {{an early}} form of yoga called nirodhayoga (yoga of cessation) is {{contained}} in the Mokshadharma section of the 12th chapter (Shanti Parva) of the Mahabharata. The verses of the section are dated to c. 300–200 BCE. Nirodhayoga emphasizes progressive withdrawal from the contents of empirical consciousness such as thoughts, sensations etc. until purusha (<b>Self)</b> <b>is</b> realized. Terms like vichara (subtle reflection), viveka (discrimination) and others which are similar to Patanjali's terminology are mentioned, but not described. There is no uniform goal of yoga mentioned in the Mahabharata. Separation of self from matter, perceiving Brahman everywhere, entering into Brahman etc. are all described as goals of yoga. Samkhya and yoga are conflated together and some verses describe them as being identical. Mokshadharma also describes an early practice of elemental meditation.|$|E

5|$|Outside {{the video}} games, Kyo has made {{appearances}} which met disapproval by critics. Lucas M. Thomas from IGN lamented {{the fact that}} Kyo has a few appearances in the volume from the manhua The King of Fighters 2003 in comparison to Ash Crimson, who is the greater focus of the series. Den of Geek found ridiculous the comic SVC Chaos as when Kyo is killed by Akuma and Takuma Sakazaki in the first chapter, Iori in turn kills himself {{in order to go}} to the afterlife and kill Kyo there which in turn causes M. Bison to also kill himself to search Iori. Additionally, John Funk from The Escapist found Kyo's actor in the series' live-action confusing since they changed his nationality from Japanese to North American when first announced seeing as one of the weakest points from the upcoming movie. Beyond Hollywood was also confused by Kyo's portrayal in the film due to flashbacks of his childhood featuring him as Japanese whereas his adult <b>self</b> <b>is</b> American.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} episode, Mahone and Michael {{are the only}} ones left on the team. Linc and Sara are captured, and <b>Self</b> <b>is</b> in the hospital. Mahone and Michael decide it is time to bring the Company down and save everyone; they decide to go after Lincoln first. They set up a trap for Christina, but the police arrive; one of Christina's guards is killed in an {{explosion}} set up by Michael and meant for Christina. Later Michael gives Scylla to Mahone without the hard drive and has him save Lincoln, while Michael goes after Sara. Mahone has a bomb in Scylla which is large enough to kill Christina and her man, Downey. Christina has Mahone put in the same room Lincoln is in, moving Lincoln {{to the other side of}} the room. When the bomb fails to detonate and Christina realizes there is something wrong with Scylla, she calls on Mahone to check the device and threatens to kill him if he cannot activate it. He sets it manually. After a struggle with Christina and Downey, Mahone runs to the room where Lincoln is; the bomb detonates, killing Downey, but Christina survives. Michael and Sara come to pick up Lincoln and Mahone and head to another location, where Scylla's hard drive is. The remaining team then heads to a hospital for supplies to treat Lincoln's gunshot wound. Sara and Mahone go into the hospital, and Mahone is arrested by Federal agents. He is later freed and exonerated when Michael delivers Scylla to Kellerman. In the series' epilogue (set four years later), Mahone, Lincoln, Sucre, Michael's child and Sara visit Michael’s grave at a beach.|$|E

25|$|The <b>self</b> <b>is</b> {{found to}} be a cause of force, free in its action, on the ground that we are obliged to relate the {{volition}} of consciousness to the self as its cause, and its ultimate cause. It is not clear from the analysis whether the <b>self</b> <b>is</b> immediately observed as an acting or originating cause, or whether reflection working on the principle of causality is compelled to infer its existence and character. If <b>self</b> <b>is</b> actually so given, we do not need the principle of causality to infer it; if it is not so given, causality could never give us either the notion or the fact of self as a cause or force, far less as an ultimate one. All that it could do would be to warrant a cause of some sort, but not this or that reality as the cause. And further, the principle of causality, if fairly carried out, as universal and necessary, would not allow us to stop at personality or will as the ultimate cause of its effect—volition. Once applied to the facts at all, it would drive us beyond the first antecedent or term of antecedents of volition to a still further cause or ground—in fact, land us in an infinite regress of causes.|$|E

25|$|The {{ideal self}} and real self involve {{understanding}} {{the issues that}} arise from having {{an idea of what}} you wish you were as a person, and having that not match with who you actually are as a person (incongruence). The ideal <b>self</b> <b>is</b> what a person believes should be done, as well as what their core values are. The real <b>self</b> <b>is</b> what is actually played out in life. Through humanistic therapy, an understanding of the present allows clients to add positive experiences to their real self-concept. The goal is to have the two concepts of self become congruent. Rogers believed that only when a therapist was able to be congruent, a real relationship occurs in therapy. It is much easier to trust someone who is willing to share feelings openly, even if it may not be what the client always wants; this allows the therapist to foster a strong relationship.|$|E
