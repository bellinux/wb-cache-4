The last lion of Algeria {{was killed in the}} Edough Massif in 1890.The massif is also the natural habitat of the Edough ribbed newt (Pleurodeles poireti), an {{endangered}} species. The vulnerable North African Fire Salamander (<b>Salamandra</b> <b>algira)</b> is also found in the range. Edoughnura, a genus of springtails belonging to the Neanuridae subfamily, is named after this range.|$|E
40|$|<b>Salamandra</b> <b>algira</b> is patchily {{distributed}} from north-western Morocco {{to eastern}} Algeria. Its occurrence in Tunisia is under debate. In {{order to examine}} the presence of S. algira in Tunisia, three field trips were made to suitable habitats in the Medjerda mountains in north-eastern Tunisia. Additionally, phenotypic and morphological examinations of >Tunisian> S. algira museum specimens originating from the ZFMK, Germany, were carried out. No indications {{for the presence of}} S. algira in Tunisia were found during the field trips. The ZFMK specimens of <b>Salamandra</b> <b>algira</b> turned out to be most likely middle or eastern European Salamandra salamandra. These results do not support earlier statements on the presence of the species in Tunisia. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{emerging}} {{infectious disease}} chytridiomycosis {{is one of}} the major factors triggering global amphibian declines. A recently discovered species of chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), likely originated in East Asia, has led to massive declines in populations of fire salamanders (Salamandra salamandra) after its apparent introduction to the Netherlands and Belgium. Here, we report the first detection of this pathogen in Germany where it caused mass mortality of fire salamanders in a captive collection. Salamanders from this collection showed an almost 100 % prevalence of infection with Bsal. Supposed Bsal-induced mortality occurred in multiple Salamandra species (S. <b>salamandra,</b> S. <b>algira,</b> S. corsica, and S. infraimmaculata), while Bsal infection was confirmed in nine subspecies of S. salamandra and in S. algira. Our study indicates that this pathogen can potentially infect all fire salamander species and subspecies. If Bsal spreads from captive collections to wild populations, then a similar devastating effect associated with high mortality should be expected...|$|R
40|$|Representatives of {{the genus}} Salamandra occur in Europe, Northern Africa and the Near East. Many local {{variants}} are known but species and subspecies status of these is still a matter of dispute. We have analysed samples from locations covering the whole expansion range of Salamandra by sequence analysis of mitochondrial D-loop regions. In addition, we have calibrated the rate of divergence of the D-loop {{on the basis of}} geologically dated splits of the closely related genus Euproctus. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences suggests that six major monophyletic groups exist (S. <b>salamandra,</b> S. <b>algira,</b> S. infraimmaculata, S. corsica, S. atra and S. lanzai) which have split between 5 and 13 million years ago (Ma). We find that each of the Salamandra species occupies a distinct geographical area, with the exception of S. salamandra. This species occurs all over Europe from Spain to Greece, suggesting that it was the only species that has recolonized Central Europe after the last glaciation. The occurrence of specific east and west European haplotypes, as well as allozyme alleles in the S. salamandra populations suggests that this recolonization has started from at least two source populations, possibly originating in the Iberian peninsula and the Balkans. Two subpopulations of S. salamandra were found that are genetically very distinct from the other populations. One lives in northern Spain (S. s. bernardezi) and one in southern Italy (S. s. gigliolii). Surprisingly, the mitochondrial lineages of these subpopulations group closer together than the remainder S. salamandra lineages. We suggest that these populations are remnants of a large homogeneous population that had colonized Central Europe in a previous interglacial period, approximately 500 000 years ago. Animals from these populations were apparently not successful in later recolonizations. Still, they have maintained their separate genetic identity in their areas, although they are not separated by geographical barriers from very closely related neighbouring populations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Salamandra</b> <b>algira</b> {{is one of}} {{the southernmost}} species of the genus, and most of its ecology remains poor-ly known. We studied the {{microhabitat}} conditions of the sites occupied by several populations of S. algira along an altitudinal gradient, and the use of water bodies for reproduction. The microclimate conditions were analysed at six sites in northern Morocco: one site in Beni Snassen massif (S. algira spelaea), two in the Middle Atlas and central Rif mountains (S. algira splendens), and three in the western Rif mountains and Peninsula Tingitana (S. algira tingitana), where a viviparous population also occurs. The microclimate was characterized using temperature and relative humid-ity data loggers for a period of two years. We also measured the surface area and depth of the water bodies where we found S. algira larvae. Our results showed an autumn-winter reproductive period for all ovoviviparous populations studied. In most of the aquatic habitats examined, larvae appeared between November and March, although this peri-od could extend to May at higher altitudes. Larval abundance and their size variability did not correlate with water body size or microclimate conditions. The {{decrease in the number of}} larvae per water body coincided with the exist-ence of suitable conditions for post-metamorphic dispersal. <b>Salamandra</b> <b>algira</b> occurred in regions with moist condi-tions (annual average relative humidity greater than 64 %) and with mean annual temperatures of 13. 6 - 18. 6 °C, but populations were largely segregated along a gradient of humidity, with some showing higher and more constant values than others.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{knowledge}} on amphibian fauna in Tunisia, about 300 water bodies belonging to different habitat typologies were sampled during the period 2004 - 2008. At the sites where amphibians were observed, we recorded the UTM coordinates, the altitude, and the following environmental features: habitat typology, hydroperiod, electric conductivity, temperature, water turbidity, and macrophyte coverage. The presence of the seven species currently known with certainty for Tunisia has been confirmed: Pleurodeles nebulosus, Discoglossus pictus, Bufo bufo, B. mauritanicus, B. boulengeri, Hyla meridionalis and Pelophylax saharicus. Conversely, no evidence on the occurrence of <b>Salamandra</b> <b>algira</b> in Tunisia, currently considered as doubtful, was collected. Furthermore, all the information available in the literature has been summarized and original data on distribution ranges, breeding phenology and habitat features of the observed species are reported; in particular, the first data on {{the ecology of the}} poorly known Pleurodeles nebulosus are provided. Present work represents a contribution towards the realization of an extensive atlas of Tunisian amphibian fauna {{to be used as a}} management tool for the conservation of Tunisian inland waters and their biota...|$|E
40|$|The {{amphibian}} fauna of the Kingdom of Morocco was traditionally {{regarded as}} poor and {{closely related to}} its European counterpart. However, an increase in research during the last decades revealed a considerable degree of endemism amongst Moroccan amphibians, as well as phenotypic and genotypic inter- and intraspecific divergence. Despite this increase in knowledge, a comprehensible overview is lacking while several systematic issues have remained unresolved. We herein present a contemporary overview of the distribution, taxonomy and biogeography of Moroccan amphibians. Fourteen fieldtrips {{were made by the}} authors and colleagues between 2000 and 2012, which produced a total of 292 new distribution records. Furthermore, {{based on the results of}} the present work, we (i) review the systematics of the genus Salamandra in Morocco, including the description of a new subspecies from the Rif- and Middle Atlas Mountains, <b>Salamandra</b> <b>algira</b> splendens ssp. nov.; (ii) present data on intraspecific morphological variability of Pelobates varaldii and Pleurodeles waltl in Morocco; (iii) attempt to resolve the phylogenetic position of Bufo brongersmai and erect a new genus for this species, Barbarophryne gen. nov.; (iv) summarize and assess the availability of tadpole-specific characteristics and bioacoustical data, and (v) summarize natural history data.

40|$|The {{opening of}} the Gibraltar land bridge {{occurred}} {{at the end of}} the Messinian Salinity Crisis approximately 5. 3 Mya, and was one of the main causes of vicariance between European and north-west African amphibians, resulting in the origin of several new species. However, little is currently known about the causes for post-Messinian amphibian differentiation in the Maghreb, although it is acknowledged that the Pleistocene glaciations probably had considerable influence on several species. The current study uses both species distribution modelling (MAXENT) and information from a total of 694 bp of mitochondrial data (351 from cytochrome b and 342 from 12 S rRNA) from 36 representatives of all three recognized subspecies of Moroccan Salamandra to infer the phylogeny and biogeography of <b>Salamandra</b> <b>algira</b> tingitana, which is characterized by both viviparous and ovoviviparous populations. According to the results, the split between S. a. tingitana and S. a. algira from the Rif and Middle Atlas mountains took place approximately 1. 6 Mya, and could have been caused by a shift towards a colder and drier climate that occurred during the upper Pliocene, which may have resulted in the isolation of Salamandra at increasingly higher altitudes, or in other climatically favourable areas.

Several lineages within S. a. tingitana originated during the Pleistocene climatic oscillations, one of which gave rise to the viviparous populations north of the Oued Martil. It is suggested that the origin of viviparity in S. a. tingitana occurred during the last 600 000 years. In order to further understand the origin of the unique viviparous population of S. algira from North Africa, predictive distribution models of the viviparous and ovoviviparous populations of S. a. tingitana were created using MAXENT to assess environmental differences. Niche divergence was subsequently determined using Schoener's D and Warren et al. 's I niche similarity metrics. Predictive modelling and niche divergence analyses revealed significant environmental differences between the two reproductive types, which could have influenced the transition from ovoviviparity to viviparity. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.
