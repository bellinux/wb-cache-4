5|$|The main {{pathological}} {{characteristics of}} PD are cell {{death in the}} brain's basal ganglia (affecting up to 70% of the dopamine secreting neurons in the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> pars compacta {{by the end of}} life) and the presence of Lewy bodies (accumulations of the protein alpha-synuclein) in many of the remaining neurons. This loss of neurons is accompanied by the death of astrocytes (star-shaped glial cells) and {{a significant increase in the}} number of microglia (another type of glial cell) in the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other cell-death {{mechanisms}} include proteasomal and lysosomal system dysfunction {{and reduced}} mitochondrial activity. Iron accumulation in the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> is typically observed {{in conjunction with}} the protein inclusions. It may be related to oxidative stress, protein aggregation and neuronal death, but the mechanisms are not fully understood.|$|E
5|$|The basal ganglia, {{also called}} basal nuclei, are {{a set of}} {{structures}} deep within the hemispheres involved in behaviour and movement regulation. The largest component is the striatum, others are the globus pallidus, the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> and the subthalamic nucleus. Part of the dorsal striatum, the putamen, and the globus pallidus, lie separated from the lateral ventricles and thalamus by the internal capsule, whereas the caudate nucleus stretches around and abuts the lateral ventricles on their outer sides.|$|E
5|$|Melanins are {{a family}} of dark-pigmented {{substances}} found {{in a wide range}} of organisms. Chemically they are closely related to dopamine, and there is a type of melanin, known as dopamine-melanin, that can be synthesized by oxidation of dopamine via the enzyme tyrosinase. The melanin that darkens human skin is not of this type: it is synthesized by a pathway that uses L-DOPA as a precursor but not dopamine. However, there is substantial evidence that the neuromelanin that gives a dark color to the brain's <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> is at least in part dopamine-melanin.|$|E
5|$|HD {{affects the}} whole brain, but certain areas are more {{vulnerable}} than others. The most prominent early effects are {{in a part of}} the basal ganglia called the neostriatum, which is composed of the caudate nucleus and putamen. Other areas affected include the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra,</b> layers 3, 5 and 6 of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, purkinje cells in the cerebellum, lateral tuberal nuclei of the hypothalamus and parts of the thalamus. These areas are affected according to their structure and the types of neurons they contain, reducing in size as they lose cells. Striatal spiny neurons are the most vulnerable, particularly ones with projections towards the external globus pallidus, with interneurons and spiny cells projecting to the internal pallidum being less affected. HD also causes an abnormal increase in astrocytes and activation of the brain's immune cells, microglia.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} Parkinson's disease is {{generally}} unknown, but believed to involve both genetic and environmental factors. Those {{with a family}} member affected {{are more likely to}} get the disease themselves. There is also an increased risk in people exposed to certain pesticides and among those who have had prior head injuries, while there is a reduced risk in tobacco smokers and those who drink coffee or tea. The motor symptoms of the disease result from the death of cells in the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra,</b> a region of the midbrain. This results in not enough dopamine in these areas. The reason for this cell death is poorly understood, but involves the build-up of proteins into Lewy bodies in the neurons. Diagnosis of typical cases is mainly based on symptoms, with tests such as neuroimaging being used to rule out other diseases.|$|E
5|$|Evidence from {{microelectrode}} recordings {{from the}} brains of animals shows that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> are strongly activated by {{a wide variety of}} rewarding events. These reward-responsive dopamine neurons in the VTA and <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> are crucial for reward-related cognition and serve as the central component of the reward system.The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner....The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.... If motivational drive is described in terms of wanting, and hedonic evaluation in terms of liking, it appears that wanting can be dissociated from liking and that dopamine may influence these phenomena differently. Differences between wanting and liking are confirmed in reports by human addicts, who state that their desire for drugs (wanting) increases with continued use even when pleasure (liking) decreases because of tolerance.}} The function of dopamine varies in each axonal projection from the VTA and substantia nigra; for example, the VTA–nucleus accumbens shell projection assigns incentive salience ("want") to rewarding stimuli and its associated cues, the VTA–orbitofrontal cortex projection updates the value of different goals in accordance with their incentive salience, the VTA–amygdala and VTA–hippocampus projections mediate the consolidation of reward-related memories, and both the VTA–nucleus accumbens core and substantia nigra–dorsal striatum pathways are involved in learning motor responses that facilitate the acquisition of rewarding stimuli. Some activity within the VTA dopaminergic projections appears to be associated with reward prediction as well.|$|E
5|$|There is {{speculation}} {{of several}} {{mechanisms by which}} the brain cells could be lost. One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. This insoluble protein accumulates inside neurones forming inclusions called Lewy bodies. According to the Braak staging, a classification of the disease based on pathological findings, Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory bulb, medulla oblongata and pontine tegmentum; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or may have early non-motor symptoms (such as loss of sense of smell, or some sleep or automatic dysfunction). As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra,</b> areas of the midbrain and basal forebrain and, finally, the neocortex. These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD; however, Lewy bodies may not cause cell death {{and they may be}} protective (with the abnormal protein sequestered or walled off). Other forms of alpha-synuclein (e.g., oligomers) that are not aggregated in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites may actually be the toxic forms of the protein. In people with dementia, a generalized presence of Lewy bodies is common in cortical areas. Neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, are not common unless the person is demented.|$|E
25|$|Ghrelin, {{through its}} {{receptor}} increases {{the concentration of}} dopamine in the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra,</b> DAT is {{localized}} to axonal and dendritic (i.e., pre- and post-synaptic) plasma membranes.|$|E
25|$|DAT in the mesocortical pathway, {{labeled with}} {{radioactive}} antibodies, {{was found to}} be enriched in dendrites and cell bodies of neurons in the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> pars compacta and ventral tegmental area. This pattern makes sense for a protein that regulates dopamine levels in the synapse.|$|E
25|$|Levodopa (or L-DOPA) {{has been}} the most widely used {{treatment}} for over 30 years. L-DOPA is transformed into dopamine in the dopaminergic neurons by dopa-decarboxylase. Since motor symptoms are produced by a lack of dopamine in the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra,</b> the administration of L-DOPA temporarily diminishes the motor symptomatology.|$|E
25|$|Regional {{distribution}} of DAT {{has been found}} in areas of the brain with established dopaminergic circuitry including: nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, and mesocortical pathways. The nuclei that make up these pathways have distinct patterns of expression. Gene expression patterns in the adult mouse show high expression in the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> pars compacta.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin is {{also found}} outside red blood cells and their {{progenitor}} lines. Other cells that contain hemoglobin include the A9 dopaminergic neurons in the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra,</b> macrophages, alveolar cells, and mesangial cells in the kidney. In these tissues, hemoglobin has a non-oxygen-carrying function as an antioxidant and a regulator of iron metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Parkinson' disease causes {{constipation}} and gastric dysmotility that is {{severe enough}} to endanger comfort and even health. A factor in this is the appearance of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites even before these affect {{the functioning of the}} <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> in the neurons in the enteric nervous system that control gut functions.|$|E
25|$|MPP+, {{the toxic}} {{metabolite}} of MPTP is a selective neurotoxin which interferes with oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria by inhibiting complex I, {{leading to the}} depletion of ATP and subsequent cell death. This occurs almost exclusively in dopaminergic neurons of the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra,</b> resulting in the presentation of permanent parkinsonism in exposed subjects 2–3 days after administration.|$|E
25|$|The International Basal Ganglia Society (IBAGS) informally {{considers}} the basal ganglia {{to be made}} up of the striatum, the pallidum (with two nuclei), the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> (with its two distinct parts), and the subthalamic nucleus, whereas Terminologia anatomica excludes the last two. Some neurologists have included the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus as part of the basal ganglia, and some have also included the pedunculopontine nucleus.|$|E
25|$|Huntington's {{disease is}} a hyperkinetic {{movement}} basal ganglia disease caused by lack of normal inhibitory inputs from medium spiny neurons of the basal ganglia. This poses the opposite effects of those associated with Parkinson's disease, including inappropriate activation of upper motor neurons. As with the GABAergic mechanisms observed in relation to Parkinson's disease, a GABA agonist injected into the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> pars reticulata decreases inhibition of upper motor neurons, resulting in ballistic involuntary motor movements, similar to symptoms of Huntington's disease.|$|E
25|$|Quinolinic acid {{has also}} been found in HAND {{patients}}’ brains. In fact, the amount of quinolinic acid found in the brain of HAND patients can be up to 300 times greater than that found in the CSF. Neurons exposed to quinolinic acid {{for long periods of}} time can develop cytoskeletal abnormalities, vacuolization, and cell death. HAND patients’ brains contain many of these defects. Furthermore, studies in rats have demonstrated that quinolinic acid can lead to neuronal death in brains structures that are affected by HAND, including the striatum, hippocampus, the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra,</b> and non-limbic cortex.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} found that adults who stutter have {{elevated}} levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, and have thus found dopamine antagonists that reduce stuttering (see anti-stuttering medication below). Overactivity of the midbrain has been found {{at the level of the}} <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> extended to the red nucleus and subthalamic nucleus, which all contribute to the production of dopamine. However, increased dopamine does not imply increased excitatory function since dopamine's effect can be both excitatory or inhibitory depending upon which dopamine receptors (labelled D1 – D5) have been stimulated.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D is an {{essential}} regulator of the vitamin D receptor that controls gene transcription during development. The vitamin D receptor is strongly expressed in the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra.</b> Accordingly, vitamin D deficiency can disrupt neurogenesis leading to altered dopamine signaling and increased exploratory behavior in rats. This is considered a rodent model of the schizophrenia phenotype and vitamin D deficiency has been proposed as {{an explanation for the}} increased incidence of schizophrenia among children that were conceived during winter months. A Finnish study found that vitamin D supplement use is associated with reduced risk of schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|Dopaminergic neurons—dopamine. Dopamine is a {{neurotransmitter}} {{that acts}} on D1 type (D1 and D5) Gs coupled receptors, which increase cAMP and PKA, and D2 type (D2, D3, and D4) receptors, which activate Gi-coupled receptors that decrease cAMP and PKA. Dopamine {{is connected to}} mood and behavior and modulates both pre and post synaptic neurotransmission. Loss of dopamine neurons in the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> {{has been linked to}} Parkinson's disease. Dopamine is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine. Tyrosine is catalyzed into levadopa (or L-DOPA) by tyrosine hydroxlase, and levadopa is then converted into dopamine by amino acid decarboxylase.|$|E
25|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} the second most common {{neurodegenerative}} disease after Alzheimer's disease. It is a hypokinetic movement basal ganglia disease caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> of the human brain. The inhibitory outflow of the basal ganglia is thus not decreased, and so upper motor neurons, mediated by the thalamus, are not activated in a timely manner. Specific symptoms include rigidity, postural problems, slow movements, and tremors. Blocking GABA receptor input from medium spiny neurons to reticulata cells, causes inhibition of upper motor neurons similar to the inhibition that occurs in Parkinson's disease.|$|E
25|$|To date, TAAR1 {{has been}} {{identified}} and cloned in five different mammal genomes: human, mouse, rat, monkey, and chimpanzee. In rats, mRNA for TAAR1 is found at low to moderate levels in peripheral tissues like the stomach, kidney, and lungs, and at low levels in the brain. Rhesus monkey Taar1 and human TAAR1 (hTAAR1) share high sequence similarity, and TAAR1 mRNA is highly expressed in the same important monoaminergic regions of both species. These regions include the dorsal and ventral caudate nucleus, putamen, <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra,</b> nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, locus coeruleus, amygdala, and raphe nucleus. TAAR1 has also been identified in human astrocytes.|$|E
25|$|A neural {{model for}} {{voluntary}} action proposed by Haggard comprises two major circuits. The first involving early preparatory signals (basal ganglia <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> and striatum), prior intention and deliberation (medial prefrontal cortex), motor preparation/readiness potential (preSMA and SMA), and motor execution (primary motor cortex, spinal cord and muscles). The second involving the parietal-pre-motor circuit for object-guided actions, for example grasping (premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, parietal cortex, {{and back to}} the premotor cortex). He proposed that voluntary action involves external environment input ('when decision'), motivations/reasons for actions (early 'whether decision'), task and action selection ('what decision'), a final predictive check (late 'whether decision') and action execution.|$|E
25|$|In humans {{there are}} two subtypes of {{melatonin}} receptors targeted by melatonin agonists, MT1 and MT2. They are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body, together or singly. MT1 receptors are expressed in many regions of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS): suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, hippocampus, <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra,</b> cerebellum, central dopaminergic pathways, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. MT1 is also expressed in the retina, ovary, testis, mammary gland, coronary circulation and aorta, gallbladder, liver, kidney, skin and the immune system. MT2 receptors are expressed mainly in the CNS, also in the lung, cardiac, coronary and aortic tissue, myometrium and granulosa cells, immune cells, duodenum and adipocytes.|$|E
25|$|The {{neurotoxicity}} of MPTP {{was first}} hinted at in 1976 after Barry Kidston, a 23-year-old chemistry {{graduate student in}} Maryland, synthesized MPPP (a synthetic opiate related to pethidine and the prodines) with MPTP as a major impurity, and self-injected the result. Within three days he began exhibiting symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The National Institute of Mental Health found traces of MPPP, MPTP, and other pethidine analogues in his lab. They tested the substances on rats, but due to rodents' tolerance {{for this type of}} neurotoxin nothing was observed. Kidston's parkinsonism was successfully treated with levodopa but he died 18 months later from a cocaine overdose. Upon autopsy, destruction of dopaminergic neurons in the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> was discovered.|$|E
25|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} disease described by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons located in the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra.</b> Today, {{the most commonly used}} drug to combat this disease is levodopa or L-DOPA. This precursor to dopamine can penetrate through the blood–brain barrier, whereas the neurotransmitter dopamine cannot. There has been extensive research to determine whether L-dopa is a better treatment for Parkinson's disease rather than other dopamine agonists. Some believe that the long-term use of L-dopa will compromise neuroprotection and, thus, eventually lead to dopaminergic cell death. Though there has been no proof, in-vivo or in-vitro, some still believe that the long-term use of dopamine agonists is better for the patient.|$|E
25|$|To {{localize}} INMT, {{a qualitative}} leap is accomplished {{with use of}} modern techniques of molecular biology, and of immunohistochemistry. In humans, a gene encoding INMT is determined to be located on chromosome 7. Northern blot analyses reveal INMT messenger RNA (mRNA) to be highly expressed in rabbit lung, and in human thyroid, adrenal gland, and lung. Intermediate levels of expression are found in human heart, skeletal muscle, trachea, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, testis, prostate, placenta, lymph node, and spinal cord. Low to very low levels of expression are noted in rabbit brain, and human thymus, liver, spleen, kidney, colon, ovary, and bone marrow. INMT mRNA expression is absent in human peripheral blood leukocytes, whole brain, and in tissue from 7 specific brain regions (thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, amygdala, <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra,</b> and corpus callosum). Immunohistochemistry showed INMT {{to be present in}} large amounts in glandular epithelial cells of small and large intestines. In 2011, immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of INMT in primate nervous tissue including retina, spinal cord motor neurons, and pineal gland.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{pathways}} involving basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry, both {{of which}} originate in the neostriatum. The direct pathway projects to the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and to the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> pars reticulata (SNr). These projections are inhibitory and {{have been found to}} utilize both GABA and substance P. The indirect pathway, which projects to the globus pallidus external (GPe), is also inhibitory and uses GABA and enkephalin. The GPe projects to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which then projects back to the GPi and GPe via excitatory, glutaminergic pathways. Excitation of the direct pathway leads to disinhibition of the GABAergic neurons of the GPi/SNr, ultimately resulting in activation of thalamic neurons and excitation of cortical neurons. In contrast, activation of the indirect pathway stimulates the inhibitory striatal GABA/enkephalin projection, resulting in suppression of GABAerigc neuronal activity. This, in turn, causes disinhibition of the STN excitatory outputs, thus triggering the GPi/SNr inhibitory projections to the thalamus and decreased activation of cortical neurons. While deregulation of either of these pathways can disturb motor output, hyperkinesia is thought to result from overactivity of the direct pathway and decreased activity from the indirect pathway.|$|E
25|$|The nigral afferences {{come from}} the pars reticulata of the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra.</b> The axons do not {{constitute}} a conspicuous bundle. They are placed medially to the pallidal and ascend almost vertically. A part of the territory is posterior and inferior {{going up to the}} anterior pole of the central complex. This part sometimes designated as VM is simply the posterior continuation of the nigral territory. There is indeed no more VM in the upper primates where the pallidal and nigral territories are everywhere separated. In the whole territory axons expand widely (François et al., 2002) allowing no precise map, which is confirmed by physiology (Wichemann and Kliem, 2004). VA is crossed by the mammillothalamic bundle. The mediator of the nigro-thalamic connection is, as for the pallido-thalamic the inhibitor GABA. In addition to nigral, VA receives amygdalar and tectal (superior colliculus) axons. The thalamo-cortical axons go to the frontal cortex, the cingulate cortex, the premotor cortex and the oculomotor fields FEF and SEF. It is important to stress the necessity from now to clearly distinguish the pallidal VO and the nigral VA territories. The fact that they do not lead to the same cortical areas and systems is alone one reason for this. The physiology of the two territories is also different (van Donkelaar et al., 1999).|$|E
25|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a common {{neurological}} disorder characterized by a degeneration of dopamine neurons in the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> {{and a loss of}} dopamine in the putamen. It is described as a motor disease, but it also produces cognitive and behavioral symptoms. The most common treatment is dopamine replacement therapy, which consists in the administration of levodopa (L-Dopa) or dopamine agonists (such as pramipexole or ropinirole) to patients. Dopamine replacement therapy is well known to improve motor symptoms but its effects in cognitive and behavioral symptoms are more complex. Dopamine has been related to the normal learning of stimuli with behavioral and motivational significance, attention, and most importantly the reward system. In accordance with the role of dopamine in reward processing, addictive drugs stimulate dopamine release. Although the exact mechanism has yet to be elucidated, the role of dopamine in the reward system and addiction has been proposed as the origin of DDS. Models of addiction have been used to explain how dopamine replacement therapy produces DDS. One of these models of addiction proposes that over the usage course of a drug there is a habituation to the rewarding that it produces at the initial stages. This habituation is thought to be dopamine mediated. With long-term administration of L-dopa the reward system gets used to it and needs higher quantities. As the user increases drug intake there is a loss of dopaminergic receptors in the striatum which acts in addition to an impairment in goal-direction mental functions to produce an enhancement of sensitization to dopamine therapy. The behavioral and mood symptoms of the syndrome are produced by the dopamine overdose.|$|E
500|$|The {{largest and}} most {{important}} sources of dopamine in the vertebrate brain are the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> and ventral tegmental area. [...] These structures {{are closely related to}} each other and functionally similar in many respects. [...] Both are components of the basal ganglia, a complex network of structures located mainly {{at the base of the}} forebrain. [...] The largest component of the basal ganglia is the striatum. [...] The <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> sends a dopaminergic projection to the dorsal striatum, while the ventral tegmental area sends a similar type of dopaminergic projection to the ventral striatum.|$|E
500|$|The <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> {{is a small}} {{midbrain}} {{area that}} forms {{a component of the}} basal ganglia. This has two parts—an input area called the pars compacta and an output area the pars reticulata. The dopaminergic neurons are found mainly in the pars compacta (cell group A8) and nearby (group A9). [...] In humans, the projection of dopaminergic neurons from the <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> pars compacta to the dorsal striatum, termed the nigrostriatal pathway, plays {{a significant role in the}} control of motor function and in learning new motor skills. [...] These neurons are especially vulnerable to damage, and when a large number of them die, the result is a parkinsonian syndrome.|$|E
500|$|The {{basal ganglia}} {{can be divided}} into several sectors, and each is {{involved}} in controlling particular types of actions. [...] The ventral sector of the basal ganglia (containing the ventral striatum and ventral tegmental area) operates at the highest level of the hierarchy, selecting actions at the whole-organism level. [...] The dorsal sectors (containing the dorsal striatum and <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra)</b> operate at lower levels, selecting the specific muscles and movements that are used to implement a given behavior pattern.|$|E
500|$|In 1912 Frederic Lewy {{described}} microscopic {{particles in}} affected brains, later named [...] "Lewy bodies". In 1919 Konstantin Tretiakoff {{reported that the}} <b>substantia</b> <b>nigra</b> was the main cerebral structure affected, but this finding was not widely accepted until it was confirmed by further studies published by Rolf Hassler in 1938. The underlying biochemical changes in the brain were identified in the 1950s, due largely {{to the work of}} Arvid Carlsson on the neurotransmitter dopamine and Oleh Hornykiewicz on its role on PD. In 1997, alpha-synuclein was found to be the main component of Lewy bodies by Spillantini, Trojanowski, Goedert and others.|$|E
