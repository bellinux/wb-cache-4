Each of those facilities has a documented safety analysis (DSA) that describes accidents that the facility and the materials within it may encounter. Facilities at the SRS are planning on utilizing the certified Model 9977 Shipping Package as a long term storage package and one of these facilities required ballistics testing. Specifically, {{in order to meet the}} facility DSA, the radioactive materials (RAM) must be contained within the storage package after impact by a. 223 caliber round. In order to qualify the Model 9977 Shipping Package for storage in this location, the package had to be tested under these conditions. Over the past two years, the Model 9977 Shipping Package has been subjected to a series of ballistics tests. The purpose of the testing was to determine if the 9977 would be suitable for use as a storage package at a Savannah River Site facility. The facility requirements are that the package must not release any of its contents following the impact in its most vulnerable location by a. 223 caliber round. A package, assembled to meet all of the design requirements for a certified 9977 <b>shipping</b> <b>configuration</b> and using simulated contents, was tested at the Savannah River Site in March of 2011.

40|$|Manufacturer {{that uses}} {{containers}} to ship products always works {{to optimize the}} space inside the containers. Container loading problems (CLP) are widely encountered in forms of raw material flow and handling, product shipments, warehouse management, facility floor planning, as well as strip-packing nesting problems. Investigations and research conducted two decades ago were logistic orientated, {{on the basis of}} the empirical approaches. Starting from the late 1990 s, researchers and experts in disciplines, such as mathematics, computer science, and industrial engineering, actively participated in the developments of solutions to CLP. Their contributions are mainly in the areas of typological analyses, heuristic methods, and optimization. However, even in the mid- 2010 s, the gaps between those research contributions and the applicable level of problem-solving methods for industry are still tremendously huge. Especially, the majority of existing theoretical solutions fall short in the real-world applications due to the incapability of handling irregular shapes in three-dimensional space. To tackle this shortcoming, this research presents a topology-based metaheuristic approach that simplifies both the irregular shapes and the optimization process. Real-world data and constraints are applied to test the validity of this metaheuristic approach, such as compatibility between commodities, orientation limitations, etc. ^ This research is a project of Center for Technology Development (CTD), sponsored by American Axle Manufacturing, Deere 2 ̆ 6 Company, Eaton, and Faurecia. Within the work scope of this research, two distinctive CLP scenarios are constructed. One scenario is the <b>Shipping</b> <b>Configuration</b> Optimization (SCO), targeting the containerization processes of shipping raw materials and irregular shaped Semi-Knockdown (SKD) modules. The generalized constraints of this scenario are custom and highway regulations, availability of the facilities, labor cost, easiness of loading and unloading, etc. The other scenario is Warehouse and Facility Optimization (WFO). The goal of this scenario was to enhance the efficiency of shelf usage, reduce the floor occupation, corresponding to the change of demands, production plans, regulations, et cetera. ^ The developed metaheuristic approach utilizes topological spatial optimization to handle the complexities related to the three-dimensional irregular shapes. Those irregular shaped items are pixelated into three-dimensional envelop shapes, in which some clearances are added onto the original shapes to ensure the final plan is free of interference. In order to deal with the huge amount of combinations of shipping configurations, this approach applies topology-based category optimization and path optimizations to the existing guided local search (GLS). Topology-based category optimization and path optimization significantly reduce the total number of the possible configuration combinations that need to be analyzed, evaluated, and validated. ^ To test the metaheuristic approach, a proof-of-concept end-user program for engineers that implement the heuristic method is designed and developed. Pilot tests using real world data and conditions from the industrial members of CTD are conducted. The proposed heuristic method satisfactorily takes the constraints into account and generated optimal shipping configurations which cannot be obtained from previous research. ...|$|E

The model determines ship radar glint characteristics by summing reflections from individual specular structures which make up a <b>ship's</b> <b>configuration.</b> This technique is intended to produce a more realistic radar image for specific threat targets than methods which perturb an apparent target position according to some emperically determined scintillation statistic. The essence of the model is to reproduce a <b>ship</b> <b>configuration</b> as a collection of simple reflective structures such as flat plates, dihedrals, and corner reflectors. Each structure has associated with it a radar reflection cross section which is assumed to be solely a function of the angular aspect of the radiation incident upon it. The radar cross section of any reflector may be modified to account for shadowing by other reflector structures. The contributions of the simple reflectors are then recombined to obtain a useful radar description of the original complex target. This is accomplished by computing the phase sum of all visible reflectors at the receiving antenna. Due to a cut off of funds, the target model development was terminated prior to its integration into the hybrid simulation...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project has been to design a ship for LNG trade between Port Moresby and Singapore, with a cargo capacity corresponding to a total freight work {{in the range of}} 1. 000, 000 - 800, 000 m 3 annually. The main design emphases have been on propulsion- and cargo handling systems. The project is divided in to three parts. The first part gives a thorough investigation into design theory and design optimization methods. The second part gives description of current state of the art within LNG carrier designs and technical interrelationships in ship design. The third part contains the ship design process, following the systematic approach illustrated below. Based on a qualitative analysis of the most promising containment systems offered in the market, LNT A-BOX was found favourable. The LNT A-BOX consists of an independent tank type A as primary barrier, with liquid tight thermal insulation connected to the hull compartment as secondary barrier, resulting in a fabrication friendly and cost effective design with access to both primary and secondary barrier for ease of inspection and repairs. The insulation system is built up by two layers of insulation and can either consist solely of polyurethane foam, polyurethane panels or expanded polystyrene panels or a combination of these. No obvious benefits of each insulation material were clear, so six different insulation systems were determined for further investigations. Based on the given trade rout, a cargo capacity within the range of 35, 500 - 49. 000 m 3, divided in three equal sized cargo tanks, were found necessary to meet required annual freight work as well as damage stability requirements. The physical parameters of each cargo tank were furthermore determined by dimension ratios from previously built IMO A tanks in combination of with free board evaluations on existing gas carriers. A maximum allowable insulation thickness of 1040 mm was set as constraint when determining required cargo hull compartment size. The cargo compartment size was furthermore used as basis in the ship design process. In order to determine ship dimensions and hull form, ship statistics and empirical formulas was used. DWT was initially determined from comparison ships with cargo capacities within the same range, and was further used to set initial ship dimensions. Based on initial dimensions, LWT was determined from recommended empirical formulas and coefficients. An idea of required installed power for propulsion was early set by statistics, and weight of machinery systems was determined by weight coefficients. Some ship dimension iterations were performed before final dimensions where set. Hull form was furthermore determined by empirical formulas and suggestions given in various literatures. Some minor changes where later on changes after determination of main engine alternatives, and during general arrangement modelling in Autocad. In order to select the best propulsion system for the vessel, evaluation of propulsion systems currently in use on LNG carriers were performed. Thermal efficiency, propulsion efficiency and fuel efficiency was decisive factors in the evaluation process. Slow speed duel fuel and diesel engines with direct drive and fixed propeller were found beneficial and MAN engines were selected. Required engine output was determined by resistance calculations. Boil-off handling systems for each propulsion systems have been selected based on recommendations given by engine supplier. In order to determine cost and power consumption of each system, statistics of previously built systems was gathered.

High-fidelity time-domain methods available to simulate the motion of a ship in a seaway in support of control system design are often computationally expensive, so testing changes in control system parameters can be time consuming; obtaining statistically meaningful data sets can also be computationally prohibitive. Frequency-domain based codes allow the user to design control systems based on an assumed input wave spectrum, but they are very low fidelity and do not permit visualizing the time history of the ship and its actuators.

All U.S. carriers in the Nimitz-class, along with Enterprise, have four wires, {{with the exception of the}} USS Ronald Reagan and USS George H.W. Bush, which have only three. The Gerald R.

Aircraft coming in to land on a carrier are at approximately 85% of full throttle. At touchdown, the pilot advances the throttles to full power. In the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler aircraft, the aircraft automatically reduces engine thrust to 70% once the deceleration of a successful arrestment is detected. This feature can be overridden by the pilot by selecting max afterburner. If the aircraft fails to catch an arresting cable, a condition known as a [...] "bolter", the aircraft has sufficient power to continue down the angled flight deck and become airborne again. Once the arresting gear stops the aircraft, the pilot brings the throttles back to idle, raises the hook and taxies clear.|$|R
