40|$|Abstract: Chilean Needle Grass {{has been}} {{described}} as being potentially the worst environmental weed of native grasslands in South-eastern Australia and its potential distribution has been estimated to be more than 41 million ha. This research involves experiments as well as modeling and simulation of the flow and spreading of Chilean Needle Grass during slashing. Fluent, Computational Fluid Dynamic package (CFD) is employed to investigate the inherent complexities of the slashing process using a virtual slasher model and simulating the slashing process and spreading of Chilean Needle Grass involving also blade mechanics. This approach aims to develop new slasher designs capable of reducing Chilean Needle Grass spread. High accuracy of the simulations is realized through validation with experimental data. Tuft method and pressure profile measurements were performed in the wind tunnel, these experiments resulting in data about the flow pressure patterns inside the <b>slasher</b> <b>deck</b> unit. The real slashing process of Chilean Needle Grass was performed in the field, the slashing action was visualized using dyes and digital video filming while the spreading of the slashed grass was carefully mapped. These experiments helped achieve a reliable CAD-CFD slasher model, which appears to be the most effective method of analyzing the slashing process to date. The main benefit of the developed computational models is in greatly reduced trial time and the possibility of investigating a wide range of data including the effect of different slasher geometries on the spreading levels...|$|E
