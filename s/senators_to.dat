5|$|He was {{the only}} Republican senator {{to vote against the}} Freedom to Farm Act in 1996, saying that it catered to special {{interests}} rather than representing true reform of farm subsidies policy. He was one of only five <b>senators</b> <b>to</b> vote against the Telecommunications Act of 1996, {{on the grounds that it}} put the economic interests of corporations ahead of those of consumers.|$|E

5|$|The Honolulu Advertiser {{reported}} that the Senate Democratic leadership reconsidered {{their support for the}} bill because of the large demonstration of opponents and their pressure on <b>senators</b> <b>to</b> oppose the bill. It found that some senators privately suggested the bill's delay in committee or a proposed amendment to the bill were ways to avoid taking a vote following the controversy.|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} ultimately {{compromised by}} loosening suffrage requirements. It also {{reduced the number}} of delegates and <b>senators</b> <b>to</b> the Virginia General Assembly. The resulting constitution was ratified by a popular majority, though most of the voters {{in the western part of}} the state ended up voting against it. Thus, the underlying intrastate tensions remained, and would have to be addressed later.|$|E

5|$|The core {{allegation}} of the Keating Five affair is that Keating had made contributions of about $1.3 million to various U.S. Senators, {{and he called}} on those <b>Senators</b> <b>to</b> help him resist regulators. The regulators backed off, to later disastrous consequences.|$|E
5|$|After the disappointing {{end to the}} season, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that front-office changes were coming. In the end, GM Marshall Johnston retired, but Martin and Mlakar were re-signed. John Muckler was hired on June 12, 2002, the Senators' sixth GM, and the first with previous experience as a general manager (with Buffalo). He had been interested in the Ottawa job in 1991, but {{he chose not to}} wait for the <b>Senators</b> <b>to</b> make him an offer, and he joined the Sabres organization.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2005–06 season, Emery had won nine-straight games during the regular season as the back-up to Dominik Hašek. When Hašek injured his groin during the 2006 Winter Olympics, Emery became the team's de facto starter, with Mike Morrison, claimed off of waivers from the Edmonton Oilers, as Emery's backup. Emery would be the starting goaltender {{for the rest of the}} season, leading the <b>Senators</b> <b>to</b> the second round of the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs.|$|E

5|$|Chief Justice John Roberts {{administered}} {{the oath of}} office to Obama. Michelle Obama held the Bible, which was used by Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration, as Barack Obama placed his hand on the Bible and recited the presidential oath. Nearly four years earlier, then-Senator Obama had been one of 22 <b>Senators</b> <b>to</b> vote against Roberts during Roberts' Supreme Court nomination; the inauguration marked the first time a Chief Justice {{administered the}} oath to a President-elect who had previously voted against the Chief Justice's confirmation.|$|E
5|$|Fraser chaired {{a summit}} of {{leaders of the}} Coalition parties on 2 November. The {{resulting}} communiqué urged the Coalition <b>senators</b> <b>to</b> continue deferring supply. It also threatened, should Kerr grant Whitlam a half-Senate election, that the Coalition state premiers would advise their governors not to issue writs, thus blocking the election from {{taking place in the}} four states with non-Labor premiers. After the meeting, Fraser proposed a compromise: that the Opposition would concede supply if Whitlam agreed to hold a House of Representatives election {{at the same time as}} the half-Senate election. Whitlam rejected the idea.|$|E
5|$|Harper, on January 29, 2010, {{advised the}} Governor General to appoint new Conservative <b>senators</b> <b>to</b> fill five {{vacancies}} in the Senate, one each for Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and New Brunswick, and two for Ontario. The new senators were Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu, of Quebec; Bob Runciman, of Ontario; Vim Kochhar, of Ontario; Elizabeth Marshall of Newfoundland and Labrador; and Rose-May Poirier, of New Brunswick. This changed the party standings in the Senate, which {{had previously been}} dominated by Liberals, to 51 Conservatives, 49 Liberals, and five others.|$|E

5|$|In the Senate, Stevenson was a {{conservative}} stalwart, steadfastly opposing spending on internal improvements {{and maintaining a}} strict constructionist view of the constitution. He urged his fellow <b>senators</b> <b>to</b> oppose the Civil Rights Act of 1871, claiming that its provision that the president could suspend the right of habeas corpus in cases where he believed violence was imminent amounted to giving the chief executive the powers of a dictator. He also opposed the appropriation of federal money to fund the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{because he did not}} believe Congress was given the authority to make such an allocation under the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|It {{appeared}} {{as though the}} government might seize Lincoln for being insolvent. The investigation was, however, taking a long time. Keating was asking that Lincoln be given a lenient judgment by the FHLBB, {{so that it could}} limit its high risk investments and get into the safe (at the time) home mortgage business, thus allowing the business to survive. A letter from audit firm Arthur Young & Co. bolstered Keating's case that the government investigation was taking a long time. Keating now wanted the five <b>senators</b> <b>to</b> intervene with the FHLBB on his behalf.|$|E
5|$|Jennings, {{seeking to}} advance his {{political}} career, {{ran for the}} Senate twice, but was defeated in both attempts.

On the first ballot Isaac Blackford came in first, the incumbent governor, William Hendricks, came in second, and Jennings was third. On the fourth ballot Hendricks won the senate seat. In his second attempt Jennings lost to James Noble.|$|E

5|$|Since Utah {{became a}} U.S. state in 1896, it has sent congressional {{delegations}} to the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives. Each state elects two <b>senators</b> <b>to</b> serve for six years. Before the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, senators were {{elected by the}} Utah State Legislature. Members of the House of Representatives are elected to two-year terms, one from each of Utah's four congressional districts. Before becoming a state, the Territory of Utah elected a non-voting delegate at-large to Congress from 1850 to 1896.|$|E
5|$|The media {{predicted}} the <b>Senators</b> <b>to</b> be Stanley Cup contenders, {{as they had}} a strong core back after the lockout, played in an up-tempo style fitting the new rule changes and Hasek was expected to provide top-notch goaltending. The team rushed out of the gate, winning 19 of the first 22 games, in the end winning 52 games and 113 points, placing first in the East, and second overall in the League.|$|E
5|$|To a large extent, {{the public}} {{were aware of}} the vast {{financial}} resources that Augustus commanded. He failed to encourage enough <b>senators</b> <b>to</b> finance the building and maintenance of networks of roads in Italy in 20 BC, but he undertook direct responsibility for them. This was publicized on the Roman currency issued in 16 BC, after he donated vast amounts of money to the aerarium Saturni, the public treasury.|$|E
