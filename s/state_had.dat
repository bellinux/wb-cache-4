5|$|Because Florida <b>State</b> <b>had</b> {{received}} the game's opening kickoff, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. As in the first half, however, the Virginia Tech offense failed to advance the ball in any meaningful fashion. Marcus Vick threw two incompletions and running back Cedric Humes managed a short three-yard dash. Forced to punt the ball away yet again, Virginia Tech set up the game's critical play. From his 34-yard line, punter Nic Schmitt kicked the ball 49yards to the Seminoles' Willie Reid, who broke through the Virginia Tech special teams punt coverage for an 89-yard punt-return touchdown. Reid's return was the first touchdown {{of the game and}} the first touchdown in ACC Championship Game history.

5|$|On the field, several keys for {{improvement}} were identified within the media, including finding a secondary receiver to Allen Robinson, strengthening the secondary, and continuing improvement on third downs. Also, Penn State's tight end tandem, which struggled during non-conference play, needed to improve, particularly as Penn <b>State</b> <b>had</b> a young quarterback in Christian Hackenberg who would face tougher defenses in conference play.|$|E

The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added. Out of concern for greater safety, footbridges with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock ledges were removed in places, and the trail was rerouted near some falls. In {{the southern end of}} the new park, the state built the Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls, as well as a new parking area for 200cars and a concession stand, both along Pennsylvania Route 118 (PA 118).|$|E

5|$|Analyzing the results, The Burlington Free Press {{pointed to}} Shumlin's {{relatively}} soft numbers in opinion polls – {{he was in}} the mid-40s in the last four polls of the race – as evidence that voters were dissatisfied with the progress the <b>state</b> <b>had</b> made in instituting single-payer health care, with rising property taxes, and with the unsuccessful roll-out of Vermont Health Connect, the state's federal health care exchange. Shumlin's internal polls showed a close race and he touted an endorsement from U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy to try to put him over 50%. By comparison, Milne lagged in fundraising and spending, with $100,000 available compared to Shumlin's $1.1 million, which meant that he could not afford to pay for polling.|$|E
