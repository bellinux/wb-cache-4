Most research focusses on selecting efficient sets of test cases according to various coverage criteria for directed testing. We introduce a new technique to select efficient sets of <b>sub</b> <b>domains</b> from which new test cases can be sampled at random to achieve a high mutation score. We first present a technique for evolving multiple <b>sub</b> <b>domains,</b> each of which target a different group of mutants. The evolved <b>sub</b> <b>domains</b> are shown to achieve an average 160 % improvement in mutation score compared to random testing with six real world Java programs.

40|$|International audienceShape {{idealization}} transformations {{are very}} common operations when adapting a CAD component to FEA requirements. Here, an idealization approach is proposed {{that is based}} on generative shape processes used to decompose an initial B-Rep solid, i. e., extru-sion processes with material addition are used to seg-ment a solid. The corresponding extrusion primitives form the basis of candidate <b>sub</b> <b>domains</b> for idealiza-tion and their connections conveyed through the gen-erative processes they belong to, bring robustness to set up the appropriate connections between idealized <b>sub</b> <b>domains.</b> This is made possible because the con-nections between extrusion primitives have an explicit geometric representation and can be used to bound the connections between idealized <b>sub</b> <b>domains.</b> Taking ad-vantage of an existing construction tree as available in a CAD software does not help much because it may be complicated to use it for idealization processes because this tree structure is not unique. Using generative pro-cesses attached to an object that are no longer reduced to a single construction tree but to a graph containing all non trivial construction trees, is more useful for the engineer to evaluate variants of idealization. From this automated decomposition, each primitive is subjected to a morphological analysis to define whether it can idealized or not. Subsequently, geometric interfaces be-tween primitives form also a graph {{that can be used to}} process the connections between the idealized sub do-mains generated from the primitives. These interfaces are taken into account to determine more precisely the idealizable <b>sub</b> <b>domains</b> and their contours when primi-tives are incrementally merged to come back to produce the global morphological analysis of the initial object. A user defined threshold is used to tune the morpho-logical analysis with respect to further user parameters. Finally, the idealizable <b>sub</b> <b>domains</b> and their connec-tions are processed to locate the mid-surfaces and con-nect them using generic criteria that the user can tune locally using complementary criteria...|$|E

40|$|The power {{allocation}} {{and distribution}} (PAD) circuitry {{is capable of}} allocating and distributing a single or multiple sources of power over multi-elements of a power user grid system. The purpose of this invention is to allocate and distribute power that is collected by individual patch rectennas to a region of specific power-user devices, such as actuators. The patch rectenna converts microwave power into DC power. Then this DC power is used to drive actuator devices. However, the power from patch rectennas {{is not sufficient to}} drive actuators unless all the collected power is effectively used to drive another group by allocation and distribution. The power allocation and distribution (PAD) circuitry solves the shortfall of power for devices in a large array. The PAD concept is based on the networked power control in which power collected over the whole array of rectennas is allocated to a <b>sub</b> <b>domain</b> where a group of devices is required to be activated for operation.

40|$|Background Direct-to-consumer {{advertising}} (DTCA) {{has been}} used as a successful marketing strategy in the pharmaceutical industry during the past 2 centuries. Following the growth of DTCA by the pharmaceutical companies, advertisements for medical devices and technologies appeared in 2003. Currently, it remains unknown if clinical benefits after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are based on innovations in implant design, surgical techniques or patient expectations from the new implant, due to commercial based information. The aim of this study is to determine the influence of commercial based information on the early functional outcomes of TKA. Methods: A multicentre prospective hypothesis blinded cluster randomized controlled pilot study involving 40 patients was performed. We compared the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Short-Form 12 -Item Health Survey (SF- 12), Self-Efficacy for Rehabilitation Outcome Scale (SER), Pain on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and flexion between 2 groups, at 3 moments; at baseline, 2 weeks and 6 weeks after TKA. The control group received standard pre-operative information and the intervention group received, besides the standard information, an extra commercial folder containing additional information on the potential benefits of the High-Flex knee prosthesis. Results: The primary outcome, the change from baseline in the <b>sub</b> <b>domain</b> of the KOOS “Function in daily living” showed no significant difference between the control group and the intervention (High-Flex) group at 2 weeks (p= 0. 34) nor at 6 weeks (p= 0. 85). Furthermore there were no significant differences between groups, in change from baseline scores at 2 nor at 6 weeks, in secondary outcomes: KOOS <b>sub</b> <b>domain</b> “Pain”, SF- 12 <b>sub</b> <b>domain</b> “Physical Function”, “Role Physical” and “Bodily Pain”, Active flexion, Pain on the NRS and in the satisfaction score. Conclusion: In conclusion, DTCA did not lead to a significant increase in the change from baseline scores at 2 nor at 6 weeks in function, measured by the <b>sub</b> <b>domain</b> “Function in daily living” of the KOOS in the intervention group (High-Flex) compared to the control group. Also there were no significant changes from baseline scores at 2 and 6 weeks in our secondary outcomes for pain, function, ROM and satisfaction rate. The follow-up at 3 months of this pilot and other future studies are of great importance to understand the implications and effects of DTCA in orthopaedics because of the growing market of advertising for medical devices, and to know how the function after TKA in patients can be influenced to gain better results. ...|$|R
