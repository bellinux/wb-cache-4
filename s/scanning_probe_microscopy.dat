25|$|The {{top-down}} approach anticipates nanodevices {{that must be}} built piece by piece in stages, much as manufactured items are made. <b>Scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscopy</b> is an important technique both for characterization and synthesis of nanomaterials. Atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling microscopes {{can be used to}} look at surfaces and to move atoms around. By designing different tips for these microscopes, they can be used for carving out structures on surfaces and to help guide self-assembling structures. By using, for example, feature-oriented scanning approach, atoms or molecules can be moved around on a surface with <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscopy</b> techniques. At present, it is expensive and time-consuming for mass production but very suitable for laboratory experimentation.|$|E
25|$|Microscopy is the {{technical}} field of using microscopes to view objects {{and areas of}} objects that cannot be seen {{with the naked eye}} (objects that are not within the resolution range of the normal eye). There are three well-known branches of microscopy: optical, electron, and <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscopy.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} modern developments. The {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) and the Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) are two early versions of scanning probes that launched nanotechnology. There are other types of <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscopy.</b> Although conceptually similar to the scanning confocal microscope developed by Marvin Minsky in 1961 and the scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) developed by Calvin Quate and coworkers in the 1970s, newer scanning probe microscopes have much higher resolution, since they are not limited by the wavelength of sound or light.|$|E
40|$|Among {{all of the}} {{applications}} of <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscopies,</b> those that focus specifically on oxides have shown the most growing interest {{during the past three}} years. Notable advances have been made in four fields of applications: the imaging of the topography of oxides with high vertical resolution, the identification of the catalytic sites at the atomic scale, an understanding of the catalytic behavior of oxides at the micrometric scale and the analytical application of <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscopies</b> to oxides...|$|R

25|$|Nowadays it is {{possible}} to prepare very sharp emitters, including emitters that end in a single atom. In this case, electron emission comes from an area about twice the crystallographic size of a single atom. This was demonstrated by comparing FEM and field ion microscope (FIM) images of the emitter. Single-atom-apex Mueller emitters also have relevance to the <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscopy</b> and helium scanning ion microscopy (He SIM). Techniques for preparing them have been under investigation for many years. A related important recent advance has been the development (for use in the He SIM) of an automated technique for restoring a three-atom ("trimer") apex to its original state, if the trimer breaks up.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{microscopy}} and {{electron microscopy}} involve the diffraction, reflection, or refraction of electromagnetic radiation/electron beams {{interacting with the}} specimen, and {{the collection of the}} scattered radiation or another signal in order to create an image. This process may be carried out by wide-field irradiation of the sample (for example standard light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy) or by scanning a fine beam over the sample (for example confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy). <b>Scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscopy</b> involves the interaction of a scanning probe with the surface of the object of interest. The development of microscopy revolutionized biology, gave rise to the field of histology and so remains an essential technique in the life and physical sciences.|$|E
25|$|Magnification in a SEM can be {{controlled}} over a range of about 6 orders of magnitude from about 10 to 500,000 times. Unlike optical and transmission electron microscopes, image magnification in an SEM is not {{a function of the}} power of the objective lens. SEMs may have condenser and objective lenses, but their function is to focus the beam to a spot, and not to image the specimen. Provided the electron gun can generate a beam with sufficiently small diameter, an SEM could in principle work entirely without condenser or objective lenses, although it might not be very versatile or achieve very high resolution. In an SEM, as in <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscopy,</b> magnification results from the ratio of the dimensions of the raster on the specimen and the raster on the display device. Assuming that the display screen has a fixed size, higher magnification results from reducing the size of the raster on the specimen, and vice versa. Magnification is therefore controlled by the current supplied to the x, y scanning coils, or the voltage supplied to the x, y deflector plates, and not by objective lens power.|$|E

[...] The order in the SAM and orientation of molecules can be probed by Near Edge Xray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy in Reflection Absorption Infrared Spectroscopy (RAIRS) studies. Numerous other spectroscopic techniques are used such as Second-harmonic generation (SHG), Sum-frequency generation (SFG), Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), [...] as well as High-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). [...] The structures of SAMs are commonly determined using <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscopy</b> techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

In particular STM can image the shape, spatial distribution, terminal groups and their packing structure. AFM offers an equally powerful tool without the requirement of the SAM being conducting or semi-conducting. AFM has been used to determine chemical functionality, conductance, magnetic properties, surface charge, and frictional forces of SAMs. More recently, however, diffractive methods have also been used. The structure can be used to characterize the kinetics and defects found on the monolayer surface. These techniques have also shown physical differences between SAMs with planar substrates and nanoparticle substrates.|$|E
