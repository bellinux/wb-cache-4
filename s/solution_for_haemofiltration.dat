40|$|Main {{factors for}} the overall {{performances}} of haemofilters are membrane features and filter durability without clogging/clotting of capillaries. The venous line resistance is a powerful force for net filtrate flux resulting in haemoconcentration and thus is enhancing the phenomenon of membrane clogging. Therefore, we hypothesized that catheter type, as it is associated with venous line resistance, contributes to the extent in which filter longevity and filtration performance are restricted due to blocked hollow fibres. Heparinized porcine blood (5 IU/ml) was circulated in an in vitro system <b>for</b> <b>haemofiltration.</b> Three different sizes of catheters for peripheral vein access were alternately inserted into the circuit for blood return from the filter to the reservoir. To produce pressure levels lower than commonly induced by Sheldon catheters, a 14 G-vygonuele was used. Pressure levels standard for 11 - 12 French catheters were provided by 16 G-vygonuele. To produce pressure levels common for low-French or three lumen catheters, a shorted 18 G-vygonuele was used. The respective pressure levels attained were compared {{with respect to the}} overall filtration performance (system pressures, haemocompatibility and sieving coefficients). Catheters of 14 and 16 G enabled transiently maximal blood flow (Qb) /filtration rates (Qf) of 300 / 60 ml/min and continuous filtration with Qb/Qf of 200 / 40 ml/min. The shorted 18 G catheter reduced maximal blood flow rates down to Qb/Qf of 200 / 40 ml/min and continuous flow rates down to Qb/Qf of 125 / 25 ml/min. At the end, median values for blocked hollow fibres were 35 % in the 14 G-group, 40 % in the 18 G-group and 70 % in the 16 G-group. Haemocompatibility appeared to be higher in the 14 G-group with respect to various parameters when compared with the other groups. The flow resistance by the catheter chosen <b>for</b> <b>haemofiltration</b> clearly influenced the filtration performance. Thus, investigations focused on compatibility of catheter type as it related to venous line resistance levels with the particular method of renal replacement therapy that should be performed. This point could be crucial in reducing filter clogging and haemostasis during CVVH...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} {{the value of}} the Parsonnet score (PS) in identifying preoperatively patients that are likely to spend <  24 hours on the intensive care unit (ICU) following cardiac surgery.  METHOD—Prospectively collected data on 5591  patients were analysed. PS, mortality, the length of stay on the ICU (ICU-LOS), number of patients with clinical evidence of stroke, need <b>for</b> <b>haemofiltration,</b> resternotomy <b>for</b> bleeding, tracheostomy, and use of intra-aortic balloon pump were documented as outcomes. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve constructed using PS as a predictor of ICU stay <  24 hours identified a PS of 10  as the best cut off point that would predict ICU-LOS <  24 hours. The patients were therefore stratified by PS into two groups, those with a PS of 0  to 9  (PS 0 - 9) and those with a PS of 10  and above (PS 10 +).  RESULTS—The ROC curve constructed using PS as a predictor of ICU stay <  24 hours had an area under the curve of 0. 70  (0. 01). The maximum efficiency of the test was at a sensitivity of 0. 68.  This corresponded to PS 10.  The positive predictive value of the test at this score was 90. 5 %. Patients with PS 0 - 9 had a mean ICU stay of 1. 49  days, while patients with PS 10 + had a mean ICU stay of 2. 89  days (p =  0. 01). The risk of stroke, use of intra-aortic balloon pump, requirement <b>for</b> <b>haemofiltration,</b> need <b>for</b> tracheostomy, and risk of resternotomy for bleeding were each significantly less in patients with PS 0 - 9 versus those with a score of PS 10 + (p <  0. 01 in all cases). The risk of a single complication was 4. 7 % (PS 0 - 9) v 15. 2 % (PS 10 +) (p <  0. 01).  CONCLUSION—PS is an impartial and objective method of predicting postoperative complications and ICU stay <  24 hours. This is of value in selecting a cohort of patients likely to maintain a smooth flow of patients through the cardiothoracic unit when resources are limited to a few free ICU beds.    Keywords: Parsonnet score; intensive care; length of hospital stay; rationin...|$|R
30|$|Results: Sixteen {{patients}} (four patients received both CVVH and CVVHDF) {{were included}} and twenty sampling profiles (9 CVVH, 11 CVVHDF) were analysed. A two-compartment linear model best described the data. Patient weight {{was the only}} covariate that was associated with drug clearance. The mean (SD) parameter estimates were 25.2 [*]±[*] 17.3  L for central volume, 0.89 [*]±[*] 1.17  L/h for rate constant for drug distribution from the central to the peripheral compartment, 2.38 [*]±[*] 6.60  L/h for rate constant for drug distribution from the peripheral to the central compartment, 4.45 [*]±[*] 2.35  L/h for haemodiafiltration clearance and 4.69 [*]±[*] 2.42 <b>for</b> <b>haemofiltration</b> clearance. After accounting for patient weight, CVVH and CVVHDF clearance were 5.19 (± 0.74) L/h and 4.08 (± 0.50) L/h (p[*]=[*] 0.21), respectively. Dosing simulations for amikacin supported the use of high dosing regimens (≥ 25  mg/kg) and extended intervals (36 to 48  h) for most patients to achieve the pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics target of peak/MIC[*]≥[*] 8 for efficacy and the lowest probability of target attainment (PTA) of a minimal concentration[*]≥[*] 2.5  mg/L for toxicity.|$|R
40|$|Background. Cardiovascular {{instability}} still {{affects a}} large percentage of uraemic patients undergoing extracorporeal substitutive treatments. Post-dilution haemofiltration has been reported to be a method for improving cardiovascular stability; however, the limited removal of small molecular weight solutes together with the need for high blood flow from the fistula greatly restrict the use of this treatment. To increase the solute clearances and to partially resolve the necessity for high blood flow, the replacement solution, in a quantity about double that used in post-dilution mode, can be administered in pre-dilution mode. A high vascular stability has also been observed <b>for</b> pre-dilution <b>haemofiltration.</b> Since the lowe...|$|R
