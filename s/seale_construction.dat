Test results indicate the fol-lowing: 1) The differences in service life between stand-ard and compacted ropes decreased on larger sheaves. This can be explained by mechanical treatment process used in the manufacture of compacted ropes. 2) The com-pacted Filler construction tested had a service life ap-proximately 50 % longer than a compacted Warrington <b>Seale</b> <b>construction.</b> Both had a diameter of 12. 7 mm. 3) Service life increased up to 10 times when the sheave diameter was increased by 50 %...|$|E
