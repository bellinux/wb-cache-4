40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the problem of jointly {{determining}} the order size and dynamic prices for a perishable inventory system over a finite time planning horizon when firms simultaneously provide customers with a prompt delivery option and a delivery schedule option. Customers are segmented into two types, namely <b>spot</b> <b>purchase</b> customers and the forward purchase customers. Demands for both types of customers are assumed to be time and price dependent. The decision-maker of the inventory system is assumed to apply pricing policies to stimulate demand to improve revenues under the condition that customers with forward purchases may cancel their orders. A mathematical model is developed to find the optimal number of price settings, the optimal dynamic prices and the order quantity. A solution procedure is found to determine the optimal decisions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{purchasing}} behaviour of a loss-averse engineer-to-order manufacturer, who purchases {{a key component}} for his final product from a supplier under a single-wholesale-price contract with <b>spot</b> <b>purchase</b> opportunities, where both the product demand and the component spot price are uncertain. Through newsvendor type of models, we analyze several key issues, including {{the effects of the}} manufacturer's loss aversion, and the effects of demand and spot price uncertainties on the manufacturer's decision behaviour. We find that the purchasing behaviour of the loss-averse manufacturer differs from those of the risk-neutral and risk-averse ones. Specifically, we identify some sufficient conditions under which the loss-averse manufacturer may purchase a larger order quantity in advance when demand becomes more uncertain or when the price becomes more uncertain. We also discuss the two-wholesale-price contract and show that fixing the emergency supply price may lead to a smaller order quantity. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the development of an optimal budget holdback policy for a multi-item procurement process. An annual budget is made available for the purchase and resupply of n items. The issue is to determine how much of the budget to commit initially and how much to hold back for spot purchases later in the year. An analytic solution to the problem is developed for the single item case and compared to the unconstrained "newsboy" solution. In the multi-item case we develop stochastic linear programming with resource models under two views of the organization's procurement process. The first view is that the overall budget is allocated to the individual item managers and <b>spot</b> <b>purchase</b> monies earmarked for one item cannot be used for another. The computational and data requirements for solution of this model are reasonable. The second view is that spot buy monies are pooled and allocated to individual items on an "as needed" basis. The linear programming model of this procurement process is much more complex and not computationally feasible {{for more than a few}} items. However, the budget allocation model of the first view is shown to be a good heuristic for determining the percent of funds to hold back for the pooled process. A numerical example and sensitivity analysis are included. purchasing and procurement, programming: stochastic, inventory/production...|$|E

40|$|As more buyers become {{interested}} in the <b>spot</b> <b>purchase</b> of liquefied natural gas (LNG), the share of spot trade in LNG business increases. This means that the cash flowing into the upstream of LNG projects {{is a combination of}} that generated by deliveries to long-term contract (LTC) customers and uncommitted product and arbitrage spot sales. LTC cash flows are more predictable while uncommitted product and arbitrage cash flows, affected by the dynamics of supply and demand, are more volatile and therefore less predictable. In this research, we formulate an inventory routing problem (IRP) which maximizes the profit of an LNG producer with respect to uncommitted product and arbitrage spot sales, and also LTC deliveries at an operational level. Using the model, the importance of arbitrage, interest rates and compounding frequency in profit maximization, and also the significance of interest rates and fluctuation in spot prices in decision-making for spot sales of uncommitted product are studied. It is proven that writing traditional LTCs with relaxed destination clauses which assist in arbitrage is beneficial to the LNG producer. However, in contrast to what was predicted neither the interest rate nor the compounding frequency has any importance in profit maximization when no change of selling strategy is observed. Apart from these, it is shown that there is a trade-off between the expectation of higher spot prices and the inventory and shipping costs in decision-making for spot sales of uncommitted product in the LNG industry. Finally, it is observed that the interest rate can affect the set of decisions on spot sales of uncommitted product, although the importance of such changes in profit remains to be further explored.

We consider a discrete version of this problem in which competing suppliers choose a reservation price and an execution price for blocks of capacity, and the buyer, facing known distributions of demand and spot price, needs to decide which blocks to reserve. We show how to solve the buyer’s (combinatorial) problem efficiently and also show that suppliers can do no better than offer blocks at execution prices that match their costs, making profits only from the reservation part of their bids. Finally we show that in an equilibrium the buyer selects the welfare maximizing set of blocks. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
40|$|Procurement, i. e., {{the process}} of obtaining {{materials}} or services and managing their inflow into organizations, is a critical process in supply chain management. Internet technologies offer attractive opportunities to reduce purchasing costs while increasing the speed and efficiency of the procurement process through seamless network integration and automated execution of key tasks. This paper attempts to model e-procurement from a lead time perspective, to capture the effects of Internet technologies on the procurement lead time. The model we develop is a multiclass queueing network called a probabilistic reentrant line. The model captures several important facets of an e-procurement process, such as use of electronic RFQ (re-quest for quotation) in systematic sourcing, use of Internet auctions in <b>spot</b> <b>purchasing,</b> contention for procurement resources, randomness in execution times of procurement tasks, and concurrent execution of multiple procurement activities. The analysis of the queueing model suggests that end-to-end lead times in e-procurement can be compressed in ingenious ways using standard queueing theoretic techniques...|$|R

Conventional alternatives for procurement range from <b>spot</b> <b>purchases</b> with specifications for easily measurable characteristics, to varying forms of strategies with precommitment.

40|$|This paper uses {{real option}} {{methodology}} {{to compare the}} cost of a long-term contract with a price cap to that of <b>spot</b> <b>purchases</b> in construction material procurement. In construction, material procurements are usually short-term, project-based and subject to high price volatility. These characteristics and the competitive nature of the industry lower the profit margin of contractors. We have observed that contractors purchase a stable amount of commodity materials such as concrete, structural steel and lumber year after year. For contractors, the price cap reduces the price volatility of materials without their being obliged to purchase a certain quantity; for suppliers, the price-cap contracts give them steady demand and a bigger market share. We evaluate this price-cap contract as a real option and find the contractor's optimal ordering policy. When materials are not frequently traded, we model price processes by using related market information and then evaluate the idiosyncratic uncertainties in a risk-neutral setting. Our methodology does not require market completeness and incorporates some {{of the results of the}} latest research in finance such as correlation pricing, option pricing and zero level pricing, as well as Monte Carlo simulation.

40|$|Water supply {{instability}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} risks faced by irrigation districts and farmers. Water procurement decision optimisation is essential in order to increase supply reliability and reduce costs. Water markets, such as <b>spot</b> <b>purchases</b> or water supply option contracts, can make this decision process more flexible. We analyse the potential interest in an option contract for an irrigation district that has access to several water sources. We apply a stochastic recursive mathematical programming model to simulate the water procurement decisions of an irrigation district?s board operating in a context of water supply uncertainty in south-eastern Spain. We analyse what role different option contracts could play in securing its water supply. Results suggest that the irrigation district would be willing to accept the proposed option contract in most cases subject to realistic values of the option contract financial terms. Of nine different water sources, desalination and the option contract are the main substitutes, where the use of either depends on the contract parameters. The contract premium and optioned volume are the variables that have a greater impact on the irrigation district?s decisions.

Due to the variability of the spot market prices and demand uncertainty, the flexibility of combined sourcing can be advantageous. <b>Spot</b> market <b>purchasing</b> is a benefit in case of low spot market prices or insufficient reserved capacity, and the capacity reservation contract is an operational risk hedging for high spot market price incidents.

In this paper, we consider secondary spectrum trading between one seller (i. e., the primary spectrum owner, PO) and multiple buyers (i. e., the secondary users, SUs) in a hybrid spectrum market with both guaranteed contract buyers (future market) and <b>spot</b> <b>purchasing</b> buyers (<b>spot</b> market). We focus on the PO's profit maximization with stochastic network information, and formulate the PO's expected profit maximization problem, where the optimal solution serves as a policy guiding the allocation of every spectrum under every possible information realization. We study systematically the optimal solutions under both information symmetry and information asymmetry, depending on whether the PO can observe the SUs' realized information. Under information symmetry, we show that the optimal solution (benchmark) maximizes both the PO's expected profit (optimality) and the social welfare (efficiency). Under information asymmetry, an incentive-compatible mechanism is necessary for eliciting the SUs' realized information. We propose the ContrAuction, an integrated contract and auction design, where the PO acts as virtual bidders (in addition to the role of an auctioneer) on behalf of the guaranteed contracts. We derive the optimal ContrAuction under the constraint of efficiency, and characterize the PO's expected profit loss (compared to that under information symmetry) induced by the information rent for the SUs...|$|R
40|$|Development and {{organization}} of procurement strategies have escalated in importance with maturity of the food processing industry, {{as well as with}} the prospect of greater choice attributable to variety development and information technology. Conventional alternatives for procurement range from <b>spot</b> <b>purchases</b> with specifications for easily measurable characteristics, to varying forms of strategies with pre-commitment. In the case of grains these choices are complicated by two factors. First, there is intrinsic uncertainty associated with end-use qualities that are not easily measurable. Second, grain prices and therefore procurement costs vary spatially due to competing market regions. Thus, shifting origins may involve higher cost due to having to bid grain away from its next best market. We posed three procurement strategies and developed analytical models to evaluate the risks and costs among these alternatives in the case of hard red spring (HRS) wheat. The first involves no commitment. The second involves some form of irrevocable commitment and the third entails less commitment. Stochastic simulation models were developed for each with an objective of cost minimization subject to different levels of risk. The results indicate that the naive strategy has the lowest expected cost, but a fairly high probability of not conforming to end-use requirements. The constant share strategies result in higher probabilities of meeting requirements, but at substantially higher costs. The opportunistic strategy results in a higher probability of meeting requirements than either of the other two alternative strategies at a comparable cost. Marketing, Agribusiness,...|$|R
