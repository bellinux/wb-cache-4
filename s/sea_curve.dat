For The Netherlands most coastal regions have a well-established <b>sea</b> level <b>curve.</b> However, {{this is not the}} case for the Wadden area. Up until recently, there were not enough reliable index points to establish a separate curve for the Northern Netherlands. Van de Plassche (1982) assumed on the basis of the little basal peat data available (two index points) that the curve for the Western Netherlands was also applicable to the North of the country. Using a modelling approach, Kiden (2002) suggested a lower curve based on postglacial isostatic subsidence. The data to support such hypothesis was expanded recently to 15 index points as presented by Kiden & Vos (in prep). We now present data on a <b>sea</b> level <b>curve</b> valid for the Dutch Wadden area, based on published and previously unpublished data to a dataset of 49 basal peat 14 C samples.

40|$|Abstract: Application {{of modern}} hypsometric {{relationships}} to former continental blocks allows {{calculation of the}} shallow sea area around each block for any given sea level. Using Hallam’s (1984) <b>sea</b> level <b>curve</b> for the post-Triassic, shallow <b>sea</b> area <b>curves</b> have been drawn for each continental block, and a global <b>curve</b> of shallow <b>sea</b> area with time produced. As the response of a block to sea level change depends upon {{the size of the}} block, the cumulative curve does not vary in a straightfor-ward manner with respect to sea level. Predictions of organic diversity change with sea level change must take account of this non-linear relationship. Global information on the elevation and area of the continental crust (hypsometry) has been available for many years (e. g. Kossinna 1933), but has been little used by palaeobiologists. Recent compilations by Harrison et al. (1983) (giving distributions down to- 200 m with respect to present sea level) and Cogley (1985) (giving distributions down to oceanic depths) have refined the data, though the broad picture remains that shown by Kossinna.

The fractal dimensions of several <b>sea</b> level <b>curves</b> were compared to a modern climatic fractal dimension of 1. 26 established for annual precipitation records. A similar fractal dimension (1. 22) based on delta(O- 18 /O- 16) in deep-sea sediments has been suggested to characterize climatic change during the past 2 m. y. Our analysis indicates that sea level changes over the past 150, 000 to 250, 000 years also exhibit comparable fractal dimensions. Sea level changes for periods longer than about 30 m. y. are found to produce fractal dimensions closer to unity and Missourian (Late Pennsylvanian) sea level changes yield a fractal dimension of 1. 41. The fact that these <b>sea</b> level <b>curves</b> all possess fractal dimensions less than 1. 5 indicates that sea level changes exhibit nonperiodic, long-run persistence.

Carbon-isotope curves and gamma-ray logs with sedimentologically described measured stratigraphic rock sections of the Ar-Rajmah Group were implemented to define facies depositional models and their sequence stratigraphic patterns within a high resolution timeframe. The Ar-Rajmah Group of the Cyrenaican Miocene includes the Benghazi Formation and Wadi-al-Qattarah in the Al-Jabal al-Khdar north, and its equivalent Msus and Sceleidima formations in the Soluq Trough south. The Cyrenaican Miocene is made up of two 2 nd-oreder sequences (SS 1 -SS 2) that includes six 3 rd-order sequences (S 1 -S 6), and at least 20 parasequences. The 3 rd-order sequences S 1 and S 2 represent the Early Miocene and are dominated by open marine bioclastic packstone and red algal packstone facies. The Early Miocene SS 1 is separated from the Middle and Late Miocene SS 2 by a major unconformity surface. The Middle Miocene is represented by the 3 rd-order sequence S 3 that dominated a mixture of oolitic grainstone, microbialites, and bioclastic packstone, red algal packstone, with evaPorites, sandstone and green shale. The 3 rd-order sequences S 4 -S 6 represent that Late Miocene sequences and dominated by oolitic grainstone, microbialites, with evaPorites and some bioclastic packstone and red algal packstone facies. The correlation between the Cyrenaican stratigraphic record and the regional Mediterranean and global Miocene isotope records, and global <b>sea</b> level <b>curve</b> indicates that the 3 rd-order depositional sequences of the Cyrenaican platform were affected by a tectonic signature besides the eustatic sea level fluctuations.

Soft coral sclerites, coral rubble and calcareous algae were found associated with this assemblage. These signatures confirm the existence of fossil patch reefs in the region, which were never reported before.
