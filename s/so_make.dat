25|$|The aged Vizier Ay sidelined Horemheb's {{claim to}} the throne and instead succeeded Tutankhamun, {{probably}} because Horemheb was in Asia with the army {{at the time of}} Tutankhamun's death. No objects belonging to Horemheb were found in Tutankhamun's tomb, whereas items donated by other high-ranking officials such as Maya and Nakhtmin were found in tomb KV62 by Egyptologists. Further, Tutankhamun's queen, Ankhesenamun, refused to marry Horemheb, a commoner, and <b>so</b> <b>make</b> him king of Egypt. Having pushed Horemheb's claims aside, Ay proceeded to nominate the aforementioned Nakhtmin, who was possibly Ay's son or adopted son, to succeed him rather than Horemheb.|$|E
25|$|The Shanyang Canal {{originally}} {{opened onto}} the Yangtze {{a short distance}} south of Yangzhou. As {{the north shore of}} the Yangtze gradually silted up to create the sandbank island of Guazhou, it became necessary for boats crossing to and from the Jiangnan Canal to sail the long way around the eastern edge of that island. After a particularly rough crossing of the Yangtze from Zhenjiang, the local prefect realised that a canal dug directly across Guazhou would slash the journey time and <b>so</b> <b>make</b> the crossing safer. The Yilou Canal was opened in 738 AD and still exists, though not as part of the modern Grand Canal route.|$|E
25|$|Already in {{existence}} {{prior to the}} planning for the line was a level crossing {{at the intersection of}} Fitzgerald and Roe streets in central Perth. The crossing allowed buses coming from Wellington Street Bus Station to connect with Fitzgerald Street and then run to the northern and north-eastern suburbs. Due to the need to construct a rail tunnel under Roe Street, it was considered unsafe and impractical to retain the existing level crossing, because it would be situated very near the tunnel entrance, and <b>so</b> <b>make</b> impossible for train drivers to see any vehicles on the crossing and take evasive action. That led to the construction of the Fitzgerald Street Bus Bridge.|$|E

25|$|James II's ill-advised {{attempts}} to Catholicise the army, government {{and other institutions}} had proved increasingly unpopular with his mainly Protestant subjects. His open Catholicism and his dealings with Catholic France had also strained relations between England and the Dutch Republic, but because his daughter Mary was the Protestant heir to the English throne, her husband William of Orange had been reluctant to act against James II for fear it would ruin her succession prospects. Yet if England was left to itself the situation could become desperate for the Dutch Republic: Louis XIV might intervene and <b>so</b> <b>make</b> James II his vassal; or James, wishing to distract his subjects, might even join with Louis in a repetition of the attack made on the Dutch Republic in 1672. By the end of 1687, therefore, William had envisaged intervention, and by early 1688 he had secretly begun to make active preparations. The birth of a son to James's second wife in June 1688 displaced William's wife Mary as James's heir apparent. With the French busy creating their cordon sanitaire in the Palatinate (too busy to consider serious intervention in the Spanish Netherlands or to move against the south-eastern Dutch provinces along the Rhine) the States General unanimously gave William their full support {{in the knowledge that}} the overthrow of James II was in the security interests of their own state.|$|E
500|$|As {{newcomers}} to the Scooby Gang, Tara Maclay and Giles' girlfriend Olivia (Phina Oruche) are inexperienced with monsters, and were brought in to express [...] "real childlike terror". Willow had, after three seasons, grown considerably more confident, having found her intellectual and emotional niche at college, and therefore was no longer evincing the terror she once had; Tara, shy, unsure of herself, and unaccustomed to such experiences, served {{to fill the gap}} that Willow's maturing had created. According to Buffy essayist Patrick Shade, Tara's and Olivia's fear [...] "heighten(s) our sense of vulnerability and <b>so</b> <b>make</b> these scenes more frightening". Joss Whedon has said that one of his favorite shots in the episode is of Olivia's frightened reaction to a Gentlemen floating by her window, leering in at her.|$|E
500|$|Most male crickets make a loud {{chirping}} sound by stridulation. The stridulatory organ {{is located}} on the tegmen, or fore wing, which is leathery in texture. A large vein runs along the centre of each tegmen, with comb-like serrations on its edge forming a file-like structure, and at the rear edge of the tegmen is a scraper. The tegmina are held at an angle to the body and rhythmically raised and lowered which causes the scraper on one wing to rasp on the file on the other. The central part of the tegmen contains the [...] "harp", an area of thick, sclerotinized membrane which resonates and amplifies the volume of sound, as does the pocket of air between the tegmina and the body wall. Most female crickets lack the necessary adaptations to stridulate, <b>so</b> <b>make</b> no sound.|$|E

500|$|Following his {{induction}} {{into the}} band, Gram Parsons began to assert his own musical agenda {{in which he}} intended to marry his love of country and western music with youth culture's passion for rock and, in doing <b>so,</b> <b>make</b> country music fashionable for a young audience. [...] He found a kindred spirit in Hillman, who had played mandolin {{in a number of}} notable bluegrass bands before joining the Byrds. [...] In addition, Hillman had also persuaded the Byrds to incorporate subtle country influences into their music in the past, beginning with the song [...] "Satisfied Mind" [...] on the Turn! Turn! Turn! album. [...] Although McGuinn had some reservations about the band's proposed new direction, Parsons convinced him that a move towards country music could theoretically expand the group's declining audience. [...] Thus, McGuinn was persuaded to change direction and abandon his original concept for the group's next album, which had been to record a history of 20th century American popular music, and instead explore country rock.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} version of DAB used the MP2 audio codec. An upgraded {{version of the}} system was released in February 2007, called DAB+, which uses the HE-AAC v2 audio codec. DAB is not forward compatible with DAB+, which means that DAB-only receivers {{are not able to}} receive DAB+ broadcasts. However, broadcasters can mix DAB and DAB+ programs inside the same transmission and <b>so</b> <b>make</b> a progressive transition to DAB+.

Based on some stylistic similarities to Dekker's known work, Harbage believes that Guy Earl of Warwick is plausibly, but not definitively, the work of a young Dekker, and that the 1620 play could be a reworking of it, so that Guy Earl of Warwick would be [...] "...the extant original of a lost revision." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sodium dodecyl sulfate, synonymously {{sodium lauryl sulfate}} (or laurilsulfate; SDS or SLS, respectively), is a {{synthetic}} organic compound with the formula CH3(CH2)11SO4Na.
