25|$|Analogues of {{mirtazapine}} include mianserin, <b>setiptiline,</b> and aptazapine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Setiptiline</b> has a tetracyclic {{structure}} {{and is a}} close analogue of mianserin and mirtazapine, with <b>setiptiline</b> being delta(13b,4a),4a-carba-mianserin, and mirtazapine being 6-azamianserin.|$|E

50|$|One of its {{products}} is the antidepressant <b>setiptiline</b> (Tecipul).|$|E
50|$|<b>Setiptiline</b> {{acts as a}} {{norepinephrine}} reuptake inhibitor, Î±2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, and serotonin receptor antagonist, likely at the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and/or 5-HT3 subtypes, {{as well as an}} H1 receptor inverse agonist/antihistamine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Setiptiline</b> (brand name Tecipul), {{also known}} as teciptiline, is a tetracyclic {{antidepressant}} (TeCA) which acts as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA). It was launched in 1989 {{for the treatment of}} depression in Japan by Mochida.|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} method {{for analysis of}} three tetracyclic antidepressants, maprotiline, mianserin, and <b>setiptiline,</b> in human whole blood was developed using headspace-solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A vial containing a blood sample, sodium hydroxide, and imipramine as an internal standard was heated at 120 ~ The extraction fiber of the SPME was exposed for 45 rain in the headspace of the vial. The compounds absorbed on the fiber were desorbed by exposing the fiber in the injection port of a GC-MS. The calibration curves, using an internal standard method, demonstrated good linearity throughout the concentration range from 0. 005 to 5. 0 pg/g for mianserin and <b>setiptiline</b> and from 0. 025 to 25 pg/g for maprotiline. No interferences were found, and the time for analysis was 60 min for one sample. In addition, this proposed method was applied to a medicolegal {{case in which the}} cause of death was suspected to be acute <b>setiptiline</b> poisoning. <b>Setiptiline</b> was detected in the left and right heart blood samples of the victim at concentrations of 1. 77 and 0. 78 pg/g, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Arachnoid cyst is {{a benign}} tumor that is {{satisfied}} in cerebrosplnal fluid, and it arises in the subarachnoid cavity. Though {{it is often}} asymptOmatic, increased intracranial pressure and convulsive seizure may rarely be combined. We report a rare case of panic disorder where a combination with arachnoid cyst was suspected. The patient (a 48 -year-old female) was admitted to our psychiatric ward {{for the treatment of}} panic disorder. Arachnoid cyst in mega cisterna magna was indicated by brain MRI, and this was thought to be pressing on the cerebellum. She was treated with medication (alprazoram, <b>setiptiline)</b> and behavioral therapy. As a result, her anxiety symptoms gradually improved. Since she had complained of morning headache during hospitalization, this headache might have been induced by the arachnoid cyst. The cyst might have affected panic disorder and careful observation is also required for the future...|$|E
