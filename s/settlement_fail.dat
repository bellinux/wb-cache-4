40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{the law and}} {{practice}} of international arbitration worldwide has increasingly evolved towards greater uniformity. There remain though a few trouble spots for which harmonization appears more difficult to achieve. The role of the arbitrator as settlement facilitator appears {{to be one of}} these trouble spots. At the same time, the search for increased efficiency {{is one of the main}} concerns of contemporary justice, including arbitration. Hence, the topic of this article which examines the present state of the law and practice to determine whether a uniform standard may be emerging and what its content may be. On the basis of comparative research and field observation, the author notes that the cultural and legal background of an arbitrator may well influence the latter's tendency to actively contribute to the amicable settlement of the dispute or not. The author then reviews the pros and cons of an arbitrator becoming involved in settlement facilitation. The main advantage is the increased efficiency of the dispute settlement process, while the main drawback lies in the threat to the impartiality of the arbitrator should the <b>settlement</b> <b>fail.</b> In the light of her analysis, the author concludes that a transnational standard may well emerge on this issue as it has for many other topics of arbitration law in the recent past. She then sketches the contours of such standard. In brief, an arbitrator acting to facilitate settlement must seek the parties' informed consent to the process and safeguard due process and equal treatment and his or her impartiality. These requirements impose certain procedures which distinguish settlement facilitation in arbitration from mediation, yet make it a valuable tool to increase the efficiency of dispute resolutio...|$|E

50|$|Route 52, {{upgraded}} to a State Highway about 1960, lost its state highway status because usage did not grow but fell away as prosperity deserted New Zealand's farming industry.

Nevertheless, Route 52 {{remains the only}} road access to large areas of highly productive hill country farmland.|$|R

40|$|The Federal Reserve {{now makes}} {{available}} current and historical data on trades in U. S. Treasury and other securities {{that fail to}} settle as scheduled. An {{analysis of the data}} reveals substantial variation in the frequency of fails over the 1990 - 2004 period. It also suggests that surges in fails sometimes result from operational disruptions, but often reflect market participants’ insufficient incentive to avoid failing. I n March 2004, the Federal Reserve Bank ofNew York began releasing statistics on trades ofU. S. Treasury and other securities that fail to settle on the date agreed upon by a buyer and seller. These statistics not only reveal the frequency of <b>settlement</b> <b>fails</b> over the past decade and a half, but also shed light on the causes of the fails. Since fails are thought to affect market liquidity when they persist at high levels, the new data merit close attention.

50|$|After {{a flurry}} of {{communications}} between Younghusband and the British authorities in India, Younghusband was temporarily recalled to the Chumbi Valley. Younghusband returned {{with more than a}} hundred mounted soldiers, more than two thousand infantry, eight big guns, two thousand coolies and four thousand yaks and mules. They arrived on the 28th of June and raised the siege of Changlo. Attempts to negotiate a <b>settlement</b> <b>failed,</b> with the Tibetans not responding to threats from Younghusband.|$|R
50|$|On July 5, 1610, John Guy {{set sail}} from Bristol, England with 39 other colonists for Cupers Cove. This, and other early {{attempts}} at permanent <b>settlement</b> <b>failed</b> {{to make a}} profit for the English investors, but some settlers remained, forming the very earliest modern European population on the island. By 1620, the fishermen of Englands West Country dominated the east coast of Newfoundland. French fishermen dominated the islands south coast and Northern Peninsula.|$|R
50|$|Beaver {{was settled}} in 1856 by Mormon pioneers {{traveling}} this road; {{it was one}} of a string of Mormon settlements along the road through Utah. By design, these settlements were located a day's ride on horseback apart, which explains the regularity of their spacing. They were generally 30 mi apart. Where intervening <b>settlements</b> <b>failed</b> or were absorbed, they became 60 mi apart. Beaver was developed between the settlements in the Pahvant Valley and those in the Parowan Valley.|$|R
50|$|Taqpangajuk was an {{attempted}} Inuit resettlement located at Singer Inlet, 40 km southwest of Killinq in Quebec, northeastern Canada. The settlement {{was created in}} the 1980s as part of a relocation programme from Killinq. Its forecast population in 2010 was 432 people. In the winter of 1987, several displaced Killiniq families established a new community at Taqpangajuk without government assistance. However, the <b>settlement</b> <b>failed,</b> {{because of a lack of}} services and education, making it too difficult.|$|R
50|$|In 1866, in Leander Knowles' shipyard, {{the vessel}} Nellie Chapin was built. This was the ship {{on which the}} Palestine Emigration Colony made their ill-fated voyage to Jaffa that year. Many members of the colony were from Addison, Indian River and Jonesport. They had sold their land and {{possessions}} with the plan to settle in Jaffa. When their <b>settlement</b> <b>failed</b> many families returned home to Maine practically destitute. A few families went further west and set up new homes in Michigan.|$|R
50|$|Norse sagas {{are written}} {{versions}} of older oral traditions. Two Icelandic sagas, commonly called the Saga of the Greenlanders and the Saga of Eric the Red, describe {{the experiences of}} Norse Greenlanders who discovered and attempted to settle land {{to the west of}} Greenland, identified by them as Vinland. The sagas suggest that the Vinland <b>settlement</b> <b>failed</b> because of conflicts within the Norse community, as well as between the Norse and the native people they encountered, whom they called Skrælingar.|$|R
50|$|The <b>settlement</b> <b>failed</b> {{because of}} the {{advanced}} age of the settlers, many of them veterans of {{the administration and the}} army. The continental climate of the Banat affected the economic viability of the project to locate a city. The plague that hit Vojvodina in 1738 and the proximity of the Ottoman threat to the region were other factors that led {{to the end of the}} colony. By 1740, many exiles had already moved to Austro-Hungarian cities, especially Budapest and Vienna.|$|R

5000|$|Abenaki Indians {{called the}} area Sagadahoc, meaning [...] "mouth of big river." [...] It was a {{reference}} to the Kennebec River, which Samuel de Champlain explored in 1605. Popham Colony was established in 1607 downstream, together with Fort St George. The <b>settlement</b> <b>failed</b> due to harsh weather and lack of leadership, but the colonists built the New World's first oceangoing vessel constructed by English shipwrights, the Virginia of Sagadahoc. It provided passage back to England. Most of Bath, Maine, was settled by travelers from Bath, England.|$|R
5000|$|Before leaving England, Whitaker {{had crossed}} paths with a York {{merchant}} {{who later became}} an English naval captain and explorer of New England, Christopher Levett of York. In Whitaker's will of 1610, and proved following his death in 1616, Whitaker noted that he owed [...] "Christopher Levite, a linen draper {{of the city of}} York" [...] just over £5. Trained as a York merchant, Levett later founded the first settlement at Portland, Maine, where he was granted 6000 acre by the King. The <b>settlement</b> <b>failed.</b>|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the rise}} of {{population}} figures local affairs could no longer be directed from Seregélyes, another settlement of the area. The establishment of a local office of administration did not improve the situation either. In the mid-1950s local economy was so strong that it could take its share from public duties. The problems of education were also about to be solved A new school building was erected in the village from 1957-59 and it has been functioning as a school up to now. The electrification of the <b>settlement</b> <b>failed</b> in 1948, but in 1956 Újfalu was linked to the national network.|$|R
50|$|In 1629, King Charles I of England granted Sir Robert Heath (the {{attorney}} general) {{the southern}} {{half of the}} English land in the New World between 36 degrees and 31 degrees north latitude from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. The land was named “Province of Carolina” or land of Charles. This area included what {{is now known as}} North Carolina and South Carolina. Sir Robert’s attempts at <b>settlement</b> <b>failed</b> and in 1645, during the English Civil War, he was stripped of all of his possessions as a Royalist supporter of the King. The first permanent settlers in Carolina came from Virginia.|$|R
50|$|Having {{lost his}} fortune, Graffenried {{returned}} penniless in 1714 to Bern, Switzerland. He owed {{a great deal}} of money to the Proprietors of North Carolina, who had funded his settlement expedition. He sold his part in New Bern to Thomas Pollock for 800 pounds. In an attempt to pay off his debts, Graffenried soon wrote a book entitled Relation; it was his apology and explanation as to why his <b>settlement</b> <b>failed.</b> He included several documents, among them a letter written to the governor of North Carolina and a layout of the settlement of New Bern. An artist, he included sketches of early colonial North Carolina.|$|R
40|$|Just as {{the colonies}} {{established}} on the North Atlantic {{islands in the}} Viking Age were peripheral to Europe, so these islands had their own peripheral areas. In Iceland the highland margins have long been a focus of archaeological research and the prevailing view has been that highland <b>settlement</b> <b>failed</b> because people had made unrealistic assessments of carrying capacity. This paper presents {{a case study of}} the northern highland valley of Krókdalur and argues that the dating and pattern of settlement in that valley indicates that its settlers were keenly aware of its limitations. It also suggests explanatory frameworks that can make sense of this marginal settlement without resorting to environmental determinism...|$|R
50|$|Following the British {{defeat in}} the American War of Independence over 1,100 Black Loyalist troops who had fought on the losing side were transported to Britain, but they mostly ended up {{destitute}} on London's streets and were viewed as a social problem. The Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor was formed. They distributed relief and helped the men to go overseas, some to what remained of British North America. In 1786, the committee funded an expedition of 280 black men, forty black women and seventy white wives and girlfriends to Sierra Leone. The <b>settlement</b> <b>failed</b> and within two years all but sixty of the migrants had died.|$|R

25|$|The {{city was}} founded in 1531 within the Valley of Cuetlaxcoapan as a Spanish city, not on the {{foundation}} of an existing indigenous city-state. Official date of foundation is 16 April 1531, however, this first attempt at <b>settlement</b> <b>failed</b> due to constant flooding of the site {{right next to the}} river. Several rivers flow through the Valley of Puebla, the San Francisco, Atoyac and the Alseseca. This valley was bordered by the indigenous city-states turned colonial towns of Cholula, Tlaxcala, Huejotzingo and Tepeaca, all of which had large indigenous populations. After the city’s foundation, this valley became the main route between Mexico City and Veracruz, the port on the Caribbean coast and the connection to Spain.|$|R
50|$|In Portugal, {{there are}} two populations of free-ranging feral horses, known as Sorraia in the {{southern}} plains and Garrano in the northern mountain chains. There are also isolated populations of feral horses {{in a number of}} other places, including Sable Island off the coast of Nova Scotia, Assateague Island off the coast of Virginia and Maryland, Cumberland Island, Georgia, and Vieques island off the coast of Puerto Rico. Some of these horses are said to be the descendants of horses who managed to swim to land when they were shipwrecked. Others may have been deliberately brought to various islands by settlers and either left to reproduce freely or abandoned when assorted human <b>settlements</b> <b>failed.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are minerals, natural gas, and oil {{deposits}} on {{the islands}} and under their nearby seafloor, also an abundance of sealife, such as fish, animals and vegetation, traditionally exploited as food by all the claimant nations for thousands of years—mostly without disputes that could risk war. In the 20th century, since the WW2 <b>settlements</b> <b>failed</b> to resolve ownership of such lesser areas of land, seas and islands—and because of the economic, military, and transportational importance—their control, especially that of the Spratlys, has been in dispute between China and several Southeast Asian countries, such as Vietnam, from the mid-20th century onwards. True occupation and control are shared between the claimants (see claims and control below).|$|R
50|$|A {{report of}} the Privy Council {{accepting}} the new terms {{was approved by the}} Governor General on December 18, 1874.

5000|$|Phillips was baptised 12 Sept 1830 at St. Saviour's church, Southwark, Surrey, {{the son of}} Thomas Phillips, a labourer, and Susan his wife, but is said to {{have been}} born in either Manchester or Tregaron, where he grew up. Living in Manchester in 1848, he came into contact with cotton traders, who were eager to {{establish}} a colony in Brazil to grow cotton for their mills in Lancashire. Phillips travelled to Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil to begin making arrangements, and by the end of May 1851 had been joined by six groups of Welsh immigrants. However, the <b>settlement</b> <b>failed,</b> apparently because most of the immigrants had backgrounds in the mining industry and found work in the Brazilian coal mines more profitable than growing cotton.|$|R
25|$|The British {{government}} had grown increasingly distressed over Mosaddegh's policies and were especially bitter {{over the loss}} of their control of the Iranian oil industry.

50|$|In March 1994, {{controversy}} over a parliamentary by-election, which the Bangladesh Awami League-led opposition claimed the BNP government had rigged, {{led to an}} indefinite boycott of Parliament by the entire opposition. The opposition also began a program of repeated general strikes to press its demand that Khaleda Zia's government resign and a caretaker government supervise a general election. Efforts to mediate the dispute, {{under the auspices of}} the Commonwealth Secretariat, failed. After another attempt at a negotiated <b>settlement</b> <b>failed</b> narrowly in late December 1994, the opposition resigned en masse from Parliament. The opposition then continued a campaign of marches, demonstrations, and strikes in an effort to force the government to resign. The opposition, including the Awami League's Sheikh Hasina, pledged to boycott national elections scheduled for 15 February 1996.|$|R
