40|$|We {{investigate}} the many-body quantum states of a laser-driven gas of Rydberg atoms {{confined to a}} large <b>spacing</b> <b>ring</b> lattice. If the laser driving is much stronger than the van-der-Waals interaction among the Rydberg sates, these many-body states are collective fermionic excitations. The first excited state is a spin-wave that extends over the entire lattice. We demonstrate that our system permits to study fermions {{in the presence of}} disorder although no external atomic motion takes place. We analyze how this disorder influences the excitation properties of the fermionic states. Our work shows a route towards the creation of complex many-particle states with atoms in lattices...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{collective}} excitation {{of a gas}} of highly excited atoms confined to a large <b>spacing</b> <b>ring</b> lattice, where {{the ground and the}} excited states are coupled resonantly via a laser field. Our attention is focused on the regime where the interaction between the highly excited atoms is very weak in comparison to the Rabi frequency of the laser. We demonstrate that in this case the many-body excitations of the system can be expressed in terms of free spinless fermions. The complex many-particle states arising in this regime are characterized and their properties, e. g. their correlation functions, are studied. In addition we investigate how one can actually experimentally access some of these many-particle states by a temporal variation of the laser parameters. Comment: 10 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{implement}} the uniform load distribution of the power-split transmission system, a pseudostatic model is built. Based on the loaded tooth contact analysis (LTCA) technique, the actual meshing process of each gear pair is simulated and the fitting curve of time-varying mesh stiffness is obtained. And then, the torsional angle deformation compatibility conditions are proposed according to the closed-loop characteristic of power flow, which will be combined with the torque equilibrium conditions and elastic support conditions to calculate the transfer torque of each gear pair. Finally, the load-sharing coefficient of the power-split transmission system is obtained, and the influences of the installation errors are analyzed. The {{results show that the}} above-mentioned installation errors comprehensively influence the load-sharing characteristics, and the reduction of only one error could not effectively achieve perfect load-sharing characteristics. Allowing for the spline clearance floating and constrained by the radial <b>spacing</b> <b>ring,</b> the influence of the floating pinion is analyzed. It shows that the floating pinion can improve the load-sharing characteristics. Through the comparison between the theoretical and related experimental data, the reasonability and feasibility of the above-proposed method and model are verified...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} natural convection heat transfer in heated vertical ducts dissipating {{heat from the}} internal surface is presented. The ducts are open-ended and circular in cross section. The test section is electrically heated imposing the circumferentially and axially constant wall heat flux. Heat transfer experiment is carried out for four different channels of 45 mm. internal diameter and 3. 8 mm thickness with length varying from 450 mm to 850 mm. Ratios of length to diameter of the channel are taken as L/D = 10, 12. 22, 15. 56, and 18. 89. Wall heat fluxes are maintained at q / / = 250 to 3341 W/m 2. The studies are also carried out on intensified channels of the same geometrical sizes with the discrete rings of rectangular section. Thickness of the rings are taken as t = 2. 0, 3. 0, 3. 8 mm; step size (s) of the rings are varying from 75 mm to 283. 3 mm and the other ratios are taken as: ratio s/D = 1. 67 to 6. 29, ratio t/D = 0. 044 to 0. 084 and ratio s / t = 19. 74 to 141. 65. A systematic experimental database for the local steady state natural convection heat transfer behaviour is obtained. The effects of L/D ratio and wall heating condition on local steady-state heat transfer phenomena are studied. The effects of ring thickness and ring spacing on heat transfer behaviour are observed. The present experimental data is compared with the existing theoretical and experimental results for the cases of vertical smooth tubes and also for tubes with discrete rings.
