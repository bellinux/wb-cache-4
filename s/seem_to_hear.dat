2500|$|Such a {{mnemonic}} is {{a simple}} collection of words, and the musical rhythm acts {{as an aid to}} memory. Thomas Thornely asked [...] "whose heart has not been stirred in early youth by the solemn chant" [...] of this mnemonic, saying that [...] "in this meaningless collocation of syllables we <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the low rumbling of thunder of the Dies Irae and are naturally led to contrast it with the light tripping of the banded prepositions that favour the accusative". A similar example is the rosa mnemonic, used by French schoolchildren, which is simply the first declension: ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{published}} Main Currents in Nineteenth-Century Literature in 1906 (six volumes). This {{book was}} among the 100 best books for education selected in 2008 by Will Durant. Durant and Brandes were both contributors to the Mother Earth magazine. In Volume 2 Brandes says about Kierkegaard, [...] "It is not merely in name that this irony bears a fundamental resemblance to Kierkegaard's, which also aristocratically [...] "chooses to be misunderstood". The Ego of genius is the truth, if {{not in the sense}} in which Kierkegaard would have us understand his proposition, [...] "Subjectivity is the truth", still {{in the sense that the}} Ego has every externally valid commandment and prohibition in its power; and, to the astonishment and scandal of the world, invariably expresses itself in paradoxes. Irony is [...] "divine audacity". In audacity thus comprehended there are endless possibilities. It is freedom from prejudice, yet it suggests the possibility of the most audacious defense of all possible kinds of prejudices. It is more easily attainable, we are told, by woman than by man. “Like the feminine garb, the feminine intellect has this advantage over the masculine, that its possessor by a single daring movement can rise above all the prejudices of civilization and bourgeois conventionality, at once transporting herself into the state of innocence and the lap of Nature". The lap of Nature! There is an echo of Rousseau's voice even in this wanton tirade. We <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the trumpet-call of revolution; what we really hear is only the proclamation of reaction. Rousseau desired to return to the state of nature, when men roamed naked through the pathless forests and lived upon acorns. Schelling wished to turn the course of evolution back to the primeval ages, to the days before man had fallen. Schlegel blows revolutionary melodies on the great romantic [...] "wonder-horn".|$|E
