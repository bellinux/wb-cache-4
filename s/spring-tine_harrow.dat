40|$|Two field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in 2000 and 2001 on a sandy-loam soil to compare harrowing and hoeing for mechanical weed control in maize (Zea mays L.). One experiment investigated four different tine adjustments of a <b>spring-tine</b> <b>harrow.</b> The other experiment compared four different hoeing systems: (1) a PTO-powered rotary tiller, (2) a precision hoe with sweep and goose-foot shares, (3) a precision hoe + torsion weeder, (4) a precision hoe + torsion weeder with tines crossed. Both experiments also included a weed check. Various mechanical and agronomic parameters were determined. Results showed that the machines tested had decidedly different working characteristics. The <b>spring-tine</b> <b>harrow</b> had operative advantages but showed poor work quality. In contrast, the work quality of the precision hoes and the rotary tiller was little influenced by operative conditions. Short-term weed density reduction was unrelated either to weed biomass at harvest or to crop yield. Maize yield was higher with hoeing than with harrowing but was probably influenced by factors other than weed control. A global evaluation of the various options available for mechanical weed control in maize {{must take into account}} issues related to the different operative conditions, which may change the relative ranking of treatments from year to year...|$|E
40|$|Dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) {{can be a}} {{profitable}} crop for farmers; however controlling weeds effectively without a decrease in yield remains a problem. An example where mechanical weed control is difficult to conduct is dry bean ‘Toscanello’, which is a small sized high-income niche product growing low to the ground. Concerning intra-row weed control, also flame weeding could be an opportunity but the dry bean heat tolerance needs to be studied. The aims of this research were to study the weed control efficacy of a <b>spring-tine</b> <b>harrow</b> and an inter-row cultivator in this bean variety, and to test the tolerance of dry bean cultivated under weed-free conditions to cross-flaming applied with different liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) doses. Flame weeding was applied at BBCH 13 and BBCH 14 bean growth stages by pairs of burners producing direct double flame acting into the intra-row space, with bean plants placed in the middle. The {{results suggest that the}} <b>spring-tine</b> <b>harrow</b> used two times at BBCH 13 and 14, respectively, lead to a yield {{similar to that of the}} weedy control. The inter-row cultivator could be an opportunity for small-sized dry bean crops producers, enabling them to obtain a similar yield compared to the hand-weeded control. Concerning the bean tolerance to cross-flaming the results showed that bean flamed at BBCH 13 stage had little tolerance to cross-flaming. Bean flamed at BBCH 14 stage was tolerant until an LPG dose of 39 kg/ha, giving yield responses similar to those observed in the non-flamed control. ...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{mechanical}} actions of weeding with a <b>spring-tine</b> <b>harrow</b> at different tine settings {{is necessary to}} achieve optimal weed control. The mechanical actions of a tine harrow in two different soils at two different locations on the harrow were investigated, pointing out the effects of varied implement settings and operational conditions on the tine weeding performance. A commercially available flexible harrow tine was investigated in sandy and sandy clay loam soils. The tine was pulled in soil bins without plants {{in order to avoid}} biological variances. Tine movements and forces acting on the tine were measured with strain gauges and analysed as the mean backward and upward tine torsion, the variation of the tine location around the mean position in sideward and upward direction and the properties of the vibrational frequency in sideward and upward direction during working. In addition, a high-speed camera was used to provide visible description of tine mechanical actions. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Intra-row {{weed control}} in organic or low-input {{cropping}} systems {{is more difficult}} than in conventional agriculture. The various mechanical and thermal devices available for intra-row weed control are reported in this review. Low-tech mechanical devices such as cultivators, finger-weeders, brush weeders, and torsionweeders tend {{to be used in}} low density crops, while <b>spring-tine</b> <b>harrows</b> are mainly applied in narrow-row high-density crops. Flame weeding can be used for both narrow and wide-row sown crops, provided that the crop is heat-tolerant. Robotic weeders are the most recent addition to agricultural engineering, and only a few are available on the market. Nowadays, robotic weeders are not yet used in small and medium sized farms. In Europe, highincome niche crops are often cultivated in small farms and farmers cannot invest in high-tech solutions. Irrespectively of the choice of low- or high-tech machines, there are several weeders {{that can be used to}} reduce the use of herbicides, making of them a judicious use, or decide to avoid them...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} action of a flexible weed <b>harrow</b> <b>spring-tine</b> during post-emergence selective treatment was evaluated in different soil textures and properties, and for different tine locations. The tine movements and forces {{acting on the}} tine were measured with strain gauges and analysed as mean tine torsion in the soil, the flexural variation of the tine top position and {{the properties of the}} vibration frequency during cultivation. In addition. a high-speed camera provided a visible description of the tine penetrating the soil. Experiments were conducted indoors in soil bins to reduce external influences.

40|$|Two field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in 2000 and 2001 on a sandy-loam soil to compare different options (harrowing or hoeing) for mechanical weed control in string bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). The first experiment investigated combinations of four tine adjustments and two treatment intensities (one or two passes) of a <b>spring-tine</b> <b>harrow.</b> The second experiment compared four different hoeing systems: (1) a PTO-powered rotary tiller, (2) a precision hoe with sweep and goose-foot shares, (3) a precision hoe (as before) + torsion weeder, and (4) a precision hoe (as before) + torsion weeder operated with the tines crossed. Both experiments also included a weedy check and a post-emergence herbicide treatment as references. Various mechanical work parameters, weed density by species, weed biomass, and string bean yield were determined for all treatments. 	The machines used in these experiments clearly showed different working characteristics, and their behaviour changed according to soil conditions. In the harrowing experiment, differences among treatments in weed density and biomass {{as well as in}} yield were usually negligible, and probably due to low initial weed presence. In contrast, hoeing was always beneficial in terms of weed control and crop yield. Data from these experiments are not conclusive to allow ranking of the mechanical weeding treatments based on their overall efficacy...|$|E
40|$|The stubble {{cultivation}} {{cuts the}} dock roots below growth points. The vegetative plant parts are then {{cut off from}} the water and nutrient supply, and regrowth is inhibited. Practical recommendation •	Summer dock treatment is especially worthwhile in dry summers with catch crop cultivation and after early maturing crops (winter barley, whole-crop silage) or with an early tillage of grass-clover. •	After grass-clover lay or cereal harvest, undercut the dock plants at a depth of 12 - 15 cm with a skim plough (without skimmer) with a support wheel, a stubble cleaner or an overlapping flat cultivator. •	Bring the roots to the surface by passing over the field with a <b>spring-tine</b> <b>harrow</b> every 7 - 14 days. Additionally, apply a rotary harrow in heavy soils to expose the roots. •	After every round, collect roots manually or let them dry in suitable weather conditions. Only leave fully dead roots on the field. Information •	Plan deep-rooted crops and annual or perennial cover crops in the crop rotation {{in order to reduce the}} water and nutrient supply in deeper soil layers and thus impair the growth conditions for dock plants. •	After a short dock treatment sow a suitable catch crop as quickly as possible, and only leave the field fallow until autumn sowing of cereals, if you intend to perform a longer treatment. •	If the dock pressure is high, refrain from sowing 4 -year, slowly growing mixtures...|$|E
40|$|Weed {{management}} {{is often the}} most troublesome technical problem to be solved in organic farming, especially in poorly competitive crops like vegetables. A four-year (2000 - 2003) series of trials was established to assess the possibility of adopting an innovative non-chemical weed management system in organic carrot grown on the Fucino plateau, i. e., the most important carrot-growing area in Italy. The system utilized for physical weed control was based first on a false seedbed technique followed by pre-sowing weed removal, performed with a special 2 m wide 6 -row <b>spring-tine</b> <b>harrow.</b> Prior to crop emergence, a pass with a flame weeder equipped with four 50 cm wide-open flame burners was also performed. Post-emergence weed control consisted {{of one or more}} hoeing passes with a purpose-designed 11 -tine precision hoe equipped with spring implements (torsion weeders and vibrating tines), in addition to hand weeding. This innovative system was applied to a novel planting pattern (sowing in ten individual rows within 2 m wide beds) and compared to the standard management system of the area (sowing within 2 m wide beds but in five bands, use of spring-tine harrowing and flame weeding pre-emergence and of traditional hoeing post-emergence). The new system was tested in different commercial farms including both early and late-sown carrot. Assessments included machine operative characteristics, labor time, weed density and biomass, crop root yield and yield quality, and economic data (physical weed control costs and crop gross margin). Compared to the standard system, the innovative system usually resulted in reduced labor time (from 28 to 40 %) and total costs for physical weed control (on average - 416 € ha- 1). Use of the precision hoe resulted in intra-row weed reduction ranging from 65 to 90 %, which also led to a marked reduction in the labor required for hand weeding. In 2001 the two systems did not differ in terms of yield and yield quality, whereas in 2002 and 2003 the innovative system showed a higher mean density of carrot plants (from 28 to 55 %), root yield (from 30 to 42 %), and gross margin (from 40 to 100 %). Carrot yield was higher in farms which adopted an early sowing whereas root commercial quality was somewhat variable between systems and years. In general, results obtained with the innovative management system look very promising...|$|E
40|$|Within organic farming, {{chemical}} {{weed control}} is prohibited and is generally being replaced by different tillage practices. At {{the same time the}} supply of sufficient amounts of nitrogen is often a problem within organic fanning. In cereal crops, harrowing is considered {{to be one of the}} most important mechanical weeding techniques. The loosening and aerating of the soil produced by harrowing should potentially enhance nitrogen mineralization. Furthermore, harrowing could enhance the soil structure and water content, since tillage is generally known to positively affect these soil factors through mechanisms such as crust breaking and enhanced tillering in cereals. This study investigated the effects of mechanical weed control in the spring on weeds, nitrogen mineralization and yield of winter wheat. Weed control was carried out when the crop had 2 - 3 leaves. Three different implements were tested on two soils differing in clay content for three consecutive years: A Väderstad Crosskill roller, an s-tine harrow and a spring tine harrow, and compared with untreated controls. Soil mineral nitrogen in the 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm layers and total nitrogen content of the crop were determined on several occasions for calculations of net nitrogen mineralization in the soi 1. The numbers and weight of weeds were recorded one month after harrowing and at the time of harvesting. Grain yield was measured at harvest. The amount of dicotyledonous weeds was reduced by harrowing. On the soils with the lower clay content, weed numbers were reduced to between 50 and 82 % of those in the control, while on the soil with the higher clay content they were reduced to between 42 and 82 % of those in the control. On average, the best effect on the lighter clay soils was achieved by use of the s-tine harrow, while on the heavier clay soils the Väderstad Crosskill roller and the <b>spring-tine</b> <b>harrow</b> had the best weed control effect. In the harrowed treatments, the average mineral N content in the 0 - 30 cm layer was enhanced by only 0. 4 kg ha⁻¹. At the same time the N uptake in the crop was reduced by approximately the same amount due to the crop suffering mechanical damage, and calculations of net nitrogen mineralization showed no increase in N mineralization after harrowing. Despite annual variations, harrowing in general had a positive effect on grain yield. Comparing the different implements, the best yields on the lighter clay soil were achieved by use of the spring tine harrow, which increased the yield compared with the control by an average of 5 % in two years out of three (2002 - 2005). The best results on the heavier clay soils were achieved by use of Väderstad Crosskill roller, which gave a 5 % yield increase compared with the control, while the use of spring tine harrow and s-tine harrow caused a yield reduction of about the same magnitude. On both soil types, the use of an s-tine harrow had a negative effect on wheat yield, probably due to a high degree of mechanical damage to the crop...|$|E
