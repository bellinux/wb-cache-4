40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a {{formalism}} designed to model tidal interaction with a viscoelastic body made of Maxwell material. Our approach remains regular for any spin rate and orientation, and for any orbital configuration including high eccentricities and close encounters. The method is to integrate simultaneously the rotation and {{the position of the}} planet as well as its deformation. We provide the equations of motion both in the body frame and in the inertial frame. With this study, we generalize preexisting models to the spatial case and to arbitrary multipole orders using a formalism taken from quantum theory. We also provide the vectorial expression of the secular tidal torque expanded in Fourier series. Applying this model to close-in exoplanets, we observe that if the relaxation time is longer than the revolution period, the phase space of the system is characterized by the presence of several spin-orbit resonances, even in the circular case. As the system evolves, the planet spin can visit different spin-orbit configurations. The obliquity is decreasing along most of these resonances, but we observe a case where the planet tilt is instead growing. These conclusions derived from the <b>secular</b> <b>torque</b> are successfully tested with numerical integrations of the instantaneous equations of motion on HD 80606 b. Our formalism is also well adapted to close-in super-Earths in multiplanet systems which are known to have non-zero mutual inclinations...|$|E
40|$|According to a {{previously}} published linear analysis, the tidal distortion of accretion disks in binary star systems produces a local hydrodynamic instability to m = 1 internal waves, {{which may have}} arbitrarily small wavelengths {{in the absence of}} viscosity. The instability is three-dimensional and approximately incrompressible. To explore the nonlinear outcome of this instability, we develop a shearing-sheet approximation on scales comparable to the disk thickness. The large-scale azimuthal variation of the disk is represented by varying the local metric with time (local orbital phase). The hydrodynamic equations can then be posed two-dimensionally on local meridional planes. We solve these equations with a second-order gasdynamical code based on the Total-Variation-Diminishing scheme. Our simulations confirm the predicted linear growth rate. The modes saturate chaotically at velocities scaling as the product of the linear growth rate and the wavelength. If the wavelength is small compared with the disk thickness, the modes remain nearly incompressible even when nonlinear. The two-dimensional power spectrum of velocities after saturation is roughly isotropic and extends over a broad range of scales in an approximately power-law fashion. We measure the heating rate associated with the nonlinear dissipation of the modes. The dissipation implies a <b>secular</b> <b>torque</b> on the disk and a return of angular momentum to the secondary star via the tidal potential. The estimated torque is somewhat larger than the tidal torque produced by maximal disk viscosity (alpha approximately 1). At least in these two-dimensional simulations, however, there is no significant angular momentum flux within the disk...|$|E

" arise mainly from sun light {{reflected}} off a Solar System object and the infrared radiation emi tted by it.

40|$|There is {{currently}} no single Space Station configuration which is {{accepted as a}} baseline. However, the latest approach is toward symmetry in both geometry and mass distribution. This minimizes aerodynamic and gravity gradient torques. Solar arrays and radiators drive the configuration strongly. One axis of the solar arrays needs to be perpendicular to the orbit plane, and the geometric and principal axis should remain common along this axis to minimize <b>secular</b> <b>torques.</b> The need for both inertial and earth-fixed modes drives {{the structure of the}} Station toward a disk-like shape in the orbital plane...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} {{interaction}} of a satellite and a nearby ringlet on eccentric and inclined orbits. <b>Secular</b> <b>torques</b> originate from mean motion resonances and the secular interaction potential which represents the m= 1 global modes of the ring. The torques act on the relative eccentricity and inclination. The resonances damp the relative eccentricity. The inclination instability owing to the resonances is turned off by a finite differential eccentricity {{of the order of}} 0. 27 for nearly coplanar systems. The <b>secular</b> potential <b>torque</b> damps the eccentricity and inclination and does not affect the relative semi-major axis; also, it suppresses the inclination instability that persists at small differential eccentricities. The damping of the relative eccentricity and inclination forces an initially circular and planar small mass ringlet to reach the eccentricity and inclination of the satellite. When the planet is oblate, {{the interaction of}} the satellite damps the proper precession of a small mass ringlet so that it precesses at the satellite's rate independently of their relative distance. The oblateness of the primary modifies the long-term eccentricity and inclination magnitudes and introduces a constant shift in the apsidal and nodal lines of the ringlet with respect to those of the satellite. These results are applied to Saturn's F-ring, which orbits between the moons Prometheus and Pandora...|$|R
40|$|The angular {{momentum}} evolution of stars close to massive black holes (MBHs) {{is driven by}} <b>secular</b> <b>torques.</b> In contrast to two-body relaxation, where interactions between stars are incoherent, the resulting resonant relaxation (RR) process is characterized by coherence times of hundreds of orbital periods. In this paper, we show that all the statistical properties of RR can be reproduced in an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. We use the ARMA model, calibrated with extensive N-body simulations, to analyze the long-term evolution of stellar systems around MBHs with Monte Carlo simulations. We show that for a single-mass system in steady-state, a depression is carved out near an MBH {{as a result of}} tidal disruptions. Using Galactic center parameters, the extent of the depression is about 0. 1 pc, of similar order to but less than the size of the observed "hole" in the distribution of bright late-type stars. We also find that the velocity vectors of stars around an MBH are locally not isotropic. In a second application, we evolve the highly eccentric orbits that result from the tidal disruption of binary stars, which are considered to be plausible precursors of the "S-stars" in the Galactic center. We find that RR predicts more highly eccentric (e > 0. 9) S-star orbits than have been observed to date. Comment: 24 pages, 31 figures; final version as published in Ap...|$|R
40|$|Time-dependent {{insolation}} in {{a planetary}} atmosphere induces a mass quadrupole {{upon which the}} stellar tidal acceleration can exert a force. This "thermal tide" force can give rise to <b>secular</b> <b>torques</b> on the planet and orbit as well as radial forces causing eccentricity evolution. We apply this idea to the close-in gas giant exoplanets ("hot Jupiters"). The response of radiative atmospheres is computed in a hydrostatic model which treats the insolation as a time-dependent heat source, and solves for thermal radiation using flux-limited diffusion. Fully nonlinear numerical simulations are compared to solutions of the linearized equations, as well as analytic approximations, {{all of which are}} in good agreement. We find generically that thermal tide density perturbations lead the semi-diurnal forcing. As a result thermal tides can generate asynchronous spin and eccentricity. Our results are as follows: (1) Departure from synchronous spin is significant for hot Jupiters, and increases with orbital period. (2) Ongoing gravitational tidal dissipation in spin equilibrium leads to steady-state internal heating rates up to ∼ 10 ^ 28 erg s^- 1. If deposited sufficiently deep, these heating rates may explain the anomalously large radii of many hot Jupiters in terms of a "tidal main sequence" where cooling balances tidal heating. At fixed stellar type, planet mass and tidal Q, planetary radius increases strongly toward the star inside orbital periods 2 weeks. (3) There exists a narrow window in orbital period where small eccentricities, e, grow exponentially with a large rate. This window may explain the ∼ 1 / 4 of hot Jupiters which should have been circularized by the gravitational tide long ago, but are observed to have significant nonzero e.

The analytical formulas are compared to detailed simulations performed for the Solar Maximum Mission spacecraft, and agreement to within 10 % is found. The analytical formulas can be used in place of detailed simulations for preliminary studies, and can be used to find selected cases giving the most stringent tests of momentum unloading capability for which detailed simulations may be performed...|$|R

40|$|The major {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop preliminary concepts for controlling orbit, attitude, and structural motions of very large Space Solar Power Satellites (SSPS) in geosynchronous orbit. This study focuses on the 1. 2 -GW "Abacus" SSPS configuration characterized by a square (3. 2 3. 2 km) solar array platform, a 500 -m diameter microwave beam transmitting antenna, and an earth-tracking reflector (500 700 m). For this baseline Abacus SSPS configuration, we derive and analyze a complete set of mathematical models, including external disturbances such as solar radiation pressure, microwave radiation, gravity-gradient torque, and other orbit perturbation e#ects. An integrated orbit, attitude, and structural control systems architecture, employing electric thrusters, is developed. A key parameter that characterizes the sensitivity of a satellite to solar radiation pressure is the area-to-mass ratio, A/m; the value of A/m for the Abacus satellite is 0. 4 /kg, which is relatively large when compared to 0. 02 m /kg for typical geosynchronous communications satellites. Solar radiation pressure causes a cyclic drift in the longitude of the Abacus satellite of 2 deg, east and west. Consequently, in addition to standard active control of the orbit eccentricity using ion thrusters becomes nearly mandatory. Furthermore, continuous sun tracking of the Abacus platform requires large control torques to counter various disturbance torques. The proposed control systems architecture utilizes properly distributed ion thrusters to counter, simultaneously, the cyclic pitch gravity-gradient <b>torque,</b> the <b>secular</b> roll <b>torque</b> caused by an o#set of the center-of-mass and center-of-pressure, the cyclic roll/yaw microwave radiation torque, and the solar pressure force whose average [...] ...|$|R
