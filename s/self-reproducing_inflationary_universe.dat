50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{far-reaching}} prediction made by Linde {{was related to}} what is now called the theory of inflationary multiverse, or string theory landscape. In 1982-1983, Steinhardt, Linde and Alexander Vilenkin realized that exponential expansion in the new inflation scenario, once it begins, continues without end {{in some parts of the}} universe. On the basis of this scenario, Linde proposed a model of a <b>self-reproducing</b> <b>inflationary</b> <b>universe</b> consisting of different parts. These parts are exponentially large and uniform, because of inflation. Therefore, for all practical purposes each of these parts looks like a separate mini-universe, or pocket universe, independent of what happens in other parts of the universe.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the global structure of <b>inflationary</b> <b>universe</b> both by analytical methods and by computer simulations of stochastic {{processes in the}} early Universe. We show that the global structure of <b>inflationary</b> <b>universe</b> depends crucially on the mechanism of inflation. In the simplest models of chaotic inflation with the effective potentials φ n or e αφ the Universe looks like a sea of thermalized phase, surrounding permanently <b>self-reproducing</b> <b>inflationary</b> domains. On the other hand, in the theories where inflation may occur near a local extremum of the effective potential corresponding to a metastable state, the Universe looks like de Sitter space surrounding islands of thermalized phase. A similar picture appears even if the state φ = 0 is unstable but the effective potential has a discrete symmetry, e. g. the symmetry φ → = −φ. In this case the Universe becomes divided into domains containing different phases (η or −η). These domains will be separated from each other by domain walls. However, unlike ordinary domain walls often discussed in the literature, these domain walls will inflate, and their thickness will exponentially grow. In the theories with continuous symmetries inflation will generate exponentially expanding strings and monopoles surrounded by thermalized phase. Inflating topological defects will be stable, and they will unceasingly produce new inflating topological defects. This means that topological defects {{may play a role}} of indestructible seeds for eternal inflation. 2...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the distribution of}} energy density in a stationary <b>self-reproducing</b> <b>inflationary</b> <b>universe.</b> We show that the main fraction of volume of the universe in a state with a given density ρ {{at any given moment}} of time t in synchronous coordinates is concentrated near the centers of deep exponentially wide spherically symmetric holes in the density distribution. A possible interpretation of this result is that a typical observer should see himself living {{in the center of the}} world. Validity of this interpretation depends on the choice of measure in quantum cosmology. Our investigation suggests that unexpected (from the point of view of inflation) observational data, such as possible local deviations from Ω = 1, or possible dependence of the Hubble constant on the length scale, may tell us something important about quantum cosmology and particle physics at nearly Planckian densities.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the distribution of}} energy density in a stationary <b>self-reproducing</b> <b>inflationary</b> <b>universe.</b> We show that the main fraction of volume of the universe in a state with a given density {{at any given moment}} of proper time t is concentrated near the centers of deep exponentially wide spherically symmetric wells in the density distribution. Since this statement is very surprising and counterintuitive, we perform our investigation by three different analytical methods to verify our conclusions, and then confirm our analytical results by computer simulations. If one assumes that we are typical observers living in the universe at a given moment of time, then our results may imply that we should live near the center of a deep and exponentially large void, which we will call infloid. Validity of this particular interpretation of our results is not quite clear since it depends on the as-yet unsolved problem of measure in quantum cosmology. Therefore at the moment we would prefer to consider our results simply as a demonstration of nontrivial properties of the hypersurface of a given time in the fractal self-reproducing universe, without making any far-reaching conclusions concerning the structure of our own part of the universe. Still we believe that our results may be of some importance since they demonstrate that nonperturbative effects in quantum cosmology, at least in principle, may have significant observational consequences, including an apparent violation of the Copernican principle.

40|$|It is very {{difficult}} to obtain a realistic model of a closed <b>inflationary</b> <b>universe.</b> Even if one fine-tunes the total number of e-folds to be sufficiently small, the resulting universe typically has large density perturbations on the scale of the horizon. We describe a class of models where this problem can be resolved. The models are unattractive and fine-tuned, so the flatness of the universe remains a generic prediction of inflationary cosmology.
