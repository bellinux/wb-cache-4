5|$|Within {{the urban}} portion of Elliot Lake, the highway is locally {{maintained}} under a Connecting Link agreement.

From this point to the northern terminus of the highway, the route provides access to several mines that dot the surrounding areas. Immediately south of Quirke Mine Road, Highway108 becomes Secondary Highway639; the centre lane ends and the pavement quality is visibly reduced.|$|E

Other than paving the road, CDOT was unable to undertake any significant improvements to the highway corridor due to its projects elsewhere {{in the state and}} the requirement to coordinate efforts with the Forest Service, which owns most of the damaged land.|$|E
40|$|Research topic: Analysis of French <b>skiing</b> <b>resorts</b> {{located in}} French Alps in {{relation}} to their potential use for skiing and snowboarding excursions organised by The Faculty of Physical Education and Sport of the Charles University in Prague (UK FTVS). Aims and objectives: Describe selected French <b>skiing</b> <b>resorts</b> located in French Alps and evaluate their potential use for UK FTVS skiing and snowboarding excursions, based on the criteria set for this study. Data analysis methods: There are several methods used in this research. These are empirical methods of the scientific research, analysis of contents of appropriate literature used for the study as well as analysis of official websites of French <b>skiing</b> <b>resorts.</b> Moreover a comparison method using qualitative and quantitative assessing criteria was applied. These criteria where then compared in each individual <b>skiing</b> <b>resort.</b> Key words: <b>Skiing</b> <b>resort,</b> French Alps, <b>skiing</b> and snowboarding excursion. Findings: General analyses of the chosen <b>skiing</b> <b>resorts</b> were made. Based on these analyses, it was recommended which of the <b>skiing</b> <b>resorts</b> were the most appropriate for the excursions and which of their skiing slopes would have the best potential to be used for particular parts of the training. ...|$|R

40|$|Today French <b>ski</b> <b>resorts</b> are {{subjected}} to deep mutations, linked to customers changes, climatic change and management difficulties. In order to cope with these uncertainties, {{the representation of the}} ski-resorts can no longer be exclusively centred on the snow product but must take into account a territorial approach. Based on the analyses of districts, <b>ski</b> <b>resorts</b> are perceived as local tourist systems, underlining the weight of institutional and cultural factors in their organisation. In particular, the emergence of a tourism atmosphere is based on the formalization of proximities between actors, organisational proximity and a cognitive proximity too.

5|$|In 1939, the Norwegian Ski Federation {{proposed}} that the Association for the Promotion of Skiing arrange slalom {{as part of the}} Holmenkollen Ski Festival, but the plans were interrupted by World War II. The slalom hill was inaugurated in 1947, allowing Alpine skiing to be introduced in the Holmenkollen Ski Festival. Slalom took place at Rødkleiva while the downhill was carried out at Norefjell <b>Ski</b> <b>Resort</b> in Krødsherad. The event was named Holmenkollen Kandahar and the races in Rødkleiva were organized by SFK Lyn. Permanent cables for telephone and timing were installed in 1949.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, {{expansion}} of Sunshine Village <b>ski</b> <b>resort</b> was approved, with added parking, hotel expansion, {{and development of}} Goat's Eye Mountain. Implementation of this development proposal was delayed through the 1980s, while environmental assessments were conducted. In 1989, Sunshine Village withdrew its development proposal, in light of government reservations, and submitted a revised proposal in 1992. This plan {{was approved by the}} government, pending environmental review. Subsequently, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) filed a court injunction, which halted the development. CPAWS also put pressure on UNESCO to revoke Banff's World Heritage Site status, over concerns that developments were harming the park's ecological health.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{wetlands}} and reservoirs {{are present in}} the watershed of Stafford Meadow Brook. Reservoirs such as Lake Scranton and the Williams Bridge Reservoir are used as a water supply. Major roads in the watershed include Interstate 81, Interstate 380, Pennsylvania Route 307, and others. In the early 1900s, the main industries in the watershed included coal mining and agriculture. However, iron ore has also been mined in the watershed in the past and a sawmill was once present on the stream. Several railroads historically operated in the watershed and a number of bridges were built over the stream in the 20th century. The Montage Mountain <b>Ski</b> <b>Resort</b> is in the watershed.|$|E

Conan's encounter with the witch and Subotai was shot among the Ciudad Encantada rock formations in the province of Cuenca. Most outdoor scenes were shot in the province of Almería, which offered a semiarid climate, diverse terrain (deserts, beaches, mountains), and Roman and Moorish structures that could be adapted for many settings.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{proposed}} ski flying hills, most of which never reached the construction stage. Two were planned in Finland, in Kemijärvi and Ylitornio, but neither projects were realized after their inception in 2007. In Norway, prior to the renovation of Vikersund, there were serious talks about constructing a new ski flying hill at Rødkleiva in Oslo.

5|$|Alpine {{symbolism}} {{has played}} {{an essential role}} in shaping {{the history of the country}} and the Swiss national identity. Nowadays some concentrated mountain areas have a strong highly energetic <b>ski</b> <b>resort</b> culture in winter, and a hiking (ger: das Wandern) or Mountain biking culture in summer. Other areas throughout the year have a recreational culture that caters to tourism, yet the quieter seasons are spring and autumn when there are fewer visitors. A traditional farmer and herder culture also predominates in many areas and small farms are omnipresent outside the cities. Folk art is kept alive in organisations all over the country. In Switzerland it is mostly expressed in music, dance, poetry, wood carving and embroidery. The alphorn, a trumpet-like musical instrument made of wood, has become alongside yodeling and the accordion an epitome of traditional Swiss music.|$|E
5|$|Further {{development}} was halted {{during the war}} years afterward, although the Tenth Mountain Division, which trained at nearby Camp Hale, came to appreciate Aspen and its skiing. Many of them came back to Aspen after the war, helping to expand and staff the <b>ski</b> <b>resort.</b> Coincidentally, Walter Paepcke, head of the Container Corporation of America, visited Aspen with his wife Elizabeth in the late 1940s, and found it an ideal place to establish a music festival they were planning. He invested heavily in the city's redevelopment, and people began coming to Aspen again to live, work and play. While the Rio Grande's trains still ran, many new visitors and arrivals preferred to drive.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, logging {{began in}} the Pinkham area. After almost total {{deforestation}} of the White Mountain region, the White Mountain National Forest was created in 1911, and the Mount Washington area {{was added to the}} national forest in 1914. With the preservation of the area, emphasis shifted from logging to recreation. The Appalachian Mountain Club converted a logging camp near the height-of-land into what is now the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center in 1921. The Appalachian Trail was built through the visitor center, making it an important trailhead for ascents of Mount Washington. Meanwhile, ski trails began to be constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps on Wildcat Mountain, and the <b>ski</b> <b>resort</b> was opened in 1958.|$|E
