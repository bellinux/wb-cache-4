5|$|The {{arrival of}} Ronaldinho in 2003, and Barcelona's {{subsequent}} success in La Liga and Champions League, {{has been seen}} as crucial to an increase in the national, and worldwide, fan-base of the club. This development of a larger national fan-base has created friction between the Catalan nationalist <b>supporters,</b> <b>who</b> wish to secede from Spain, and the club's other Spanish supporters.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{suffrage}} {{movement in}} Wales attempted {{to show a}} level of independence, it was always following rather than leading a national agenda. It depended deeply in its embryonic years on celebrated suffragists from outside its borders to bring crowds to town meetings, but still relied on a network of now forgotten non-militant <b>supporters</b> <b>who</b> organised and campaigned on the ground level. And, although failing to significantly draw a rural Welsh-speaking heartland to its cause, it still embraced a national sense of pride and values that contrasted to their neighbours in England.|$|E

5|$|Atlético de Kolkata, and the ISL in general, were {{initially}} announced with a mixed reception among football fans in Kolkata. Some locals feared {{that it could}} overshadow the development of players at the city's two long-established I-League clubs, while others saw the new franchise {{as a way to}} unite both sets of I-League <b>supporters,</b> <b>who</b> would be drawn together further by the involvement of Ganguly, who is idolised across the state.|$|E
5|$|Griffin and Collett {{were cleared}} {{of half the}} charges against them—the jury {{remained}} divided on the other charges, and a retrial was ordered. On 10 November 2006, after five hours of deliberations, the jury cleared them of all charges. They were met outside the court by about 200 <b>supporters,</b> <b>who</b> Griffin addressed with a megaphone. He attacked Tony Blair and the BBC, and defended the BNP's right to freedom of speech. BNP Deputy Chairman Simon Darby later claimed that had Griffin been convicted, the BNP leader planned to go on hunger strike.|$|E
5|$|In July 2015, the Spanish Sports Council levied fines {{against both}} clubs and the RFEF, {{with all three}} {{entities}} deemed to have taken insufficient action against security breaches and planned protests of Basque and Catalan separatist <b>supporters</b> <b>who</b> jeered the Spanish national anthem and King Felipe VI. Barcelona were laden with a €66,000 fine, Athletic with €18,000 and the RFEF €123,000. Barcelona claimed that the fines were punishment of freedom of expression.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Trotsky and his {{supporters}} believed that Stalin's influence over the Third International could still be fought from within and slowly rolled back. They organised themselves into the International Left Opposition in 1930, which {{was intended to be}} a group of anti-Stalinist dissenters within the Third International. Stalin's <b>supporters,</b> <b>who</b> dominated the International, would no longer tolerate dissent. All Trotskyists, and those suspected of being influenced by Trotskyism, were expelled.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill's tenure lasted {{just six}} months; he {{resigned}} after {{a dispute with}} chairman Robert Chase over Chase's refusal to permit O'Neill to spend significant sums on strengthening the squad. According to O'Neill, the tipping point was the refusal of Chase to permit the purchase of Dean Windass. Soon after O'Neill's resignation, Chase stepped down after protests from <b>supporters,</b> <b>who</b> complained that he kept selling the club's best players, refused to reinvest in new players and consequently was to blame for relegation.|$|E
5|$|Sensing {{that there}} was growing {{frustration}} among Bolshevik <b>supporters,</b> <b>who</b> were agitating for armed insurrection, Lenin suggested an armed political demonstration in Petrograd to test the government's response. However, Lenin's health had deteriorated as he experienced headaches and insomnia and possibly began to experience the miniature heart attacks which would later afflict him. Nadezhda helped care for him, but was in poor health herself. He left Petrograd for the Finnish village of Neivola, where he visited his friend Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich to recuperate.|$|E

5|$|The French {{authorities}} imprisoned Long {{and many}} of his <b>supporters,</b> <b>who</b> openly admitted their aim of overthrowing French authorities at the trial. During the 1916 Cochinchina uprisings against French rule, many of Long's supporters attempted to break him out of jail. The French easily repelled the attack on the jail, decimating Long's movement. Following the attempted breakout, Long and his key supporters were put to death. Many of the remnants of his support base went on to join what later became the Cao Đài, a major religious sect in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners {{believed}} {{that they would be}} rewarded by the Empress Anna for getting rid of the hated Apokaukos,. She, however, was so shocked and dismayed at the loss of her principal minister, that she gave Apokaukos's <b>supporters,</b> <b>who</b> were joined by the Gasmouloi, the fleet's marines, free rein to avenge their leader's death. As a result, all prisoners, some 200 in total, were massacred, even though some attempted to seek refuge in a nearby monastery.|$|E

They {{were originally}} twenty-one, but seven were tried in absentia {{and one was}} released in April 2012. The thirteen became popular heroes in Bahrain, and analysts speculated {{that the government was}} concerned that their release might re-energize the protest movement and frustrate government <b>supporters</b> <b>who</b> oppose any royal pardons.|$|E

5|$|After much delay, the new Massachusetts Constitution {{finally went}} into effect in October 1780. To no one's surprise, Hancock was elected Governor of Massachusetts in a landslide, garnering over 90% of the vote. In the absence of formal party politics, the contest was one of personality, popularity, and patriotism. Hancock was immensely popular and unquestionably {{patriotic}} given his personal sacrifices and his leadership of the Second Continental Congress. James Bowdoin, his principal opponent, was cast by Hancock's supporters as unpatriotic, citing among other things his refusal (which was due to poor health) to serve in the First Continental Congress. Bowdoin's <b>supporters,</b> <b>who</b> were principally well-off commercial interests from Massachusetts coastal communities, cast Hancock as a foppish demagogue who pandered to the populace.|$|E
5|$|At first, Innocent {{took the}} side of the monks, and lifted Pica's excommunication. While the newest appeal was taking place, Pica and a number of his <b>supporters,</b> <b>who</b> had {{traveled}} to Rome to appeal in person, died in Rome in 1200, and some of the monks alleged this was by poison administered on the orders of Savaric. Meanwhile, Innocent had changed his mind, and reinstalled Savaric as abbot, ordering some English clergy to judge the specifics of the case, and allot the revenues of the abbey between Savaric and the monks. Savaric then attempted to secure more control over other monasteries in his diocese, but died before he could set the plans in motion.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the highly}} {{productive}} lead-up, Davidson faltered {{in his first}} outing as Australia's Test spearhead. He conceded 1/115 in only 32 overs in the first innings as South Africa reached 9/470 in the First Test in Johannesburg. With Australia 102 behind on the first innings, Davidson's tour nearly ended. Unable {{to cope with the}} 10 pm curfew imposed by team manager Jack Norton, Davidson and roommate Les Favell absconded and went sightseeing. By the time they had returned, Norton had confiscated their keys and left them a note asking them to report. The pair then went to sleep at the home of some <b>supporters</b> <b>who</b> had hosted the team for dinner the previous day.|$|E
5|$|Each club {{received}} 15,000 {{tickets for}} the final from the Football Association. Birmingham distributed their share by ballot among those <b>supporters</b> <b>who</b> had followed the team in the earlier rounds of the competition; 22,000 had attended the semi-final, so many thousands were left disappointed. Of the remaining tickets, 4,640 were allocated to the FA, 40,640 to County Associations, 20,090 to Football League clubs, 2,550 to FA members and 2,080 to the FA Council and stadium authorities. An enquiry into the black market held following the previous year's Cup Final meant ticket touts kept a lower profile than usual. However, in the week {{leading up to the}} game, the cheapest standing tickets, originally sold for 3s6d, were changing hands in Birmingham for twenty times face value, or 35%of a manual worker's weekly earnings.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{overthrow}} of al-Shishakli, Syria held its first democratic elections in five years. The Ba'ath Party, led by Aflaq, al-Bitar and al-Hawrani, had 22 members elected to parliament. This increase in influence can largely be attributed to al-Hawrani – several old ASP strongholds voted for the Ba'ath Party because of al-Hawrani's presence. By this time Aflaq was losing much of his power to al-Hawrani and his <b>supporters,</b> <b>who</b> were in {{a majority in the}} party. A proof of this was the decision of the Ba'ath Party to collaborate openly with the Syrian Communist Party (SCP), a move Aflaq opposed. Aflaq was elected the party's Secretary General of the newly established National Command, a title equivalent to 'party leader', by the party's Second National Congress.|$|E
