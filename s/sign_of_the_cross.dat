5|$|In the {{folklore}} of Croats of Ravni Kotari, {{a region}} in northern Dalmatia, there were men called vidogoja. They {{were believed to}} know past and future things.

5|$|The touch was {{originally}} meant to cure tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis (commonly {{referred to as}} scrofula or the King's Evil), rheumatism, convulsions, fevers, blindness, goitre and other ailments. Since the reign of Elizabeth I (r. 1558–1603), however, the touch was applied only to people suffering from scrofula. The Henrician practice was rarely modified, and the changes were minor; Elizabeth I made the <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> above the infected person's head, while her squeamish successor, James I (r. 1603–1625), made stroking motions above the abscesses instead of actually touching them.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Persian wars in 299, co-emperors Diocletian and Galerius traveled from Persia to Syrian Antioch (Antakya). The Christian rhetor Lactantius records that, at Antioch some time in 299, the emperors were engaged in sacrifice and divination in an attempt to predict the future. The haruspices, diviners of omens from sacrificed animals, were unable to read the sacrificed animals and failed to do so after repeated trials. The master haruspex eventually declared that this failure was the result of interruptions in the process caused by profane men. Certain Christians in the imperial household had been observed making the <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> during the ceremonies and were alleged to have disrupted the haruspices divination. Diocletian, enraged by this turn of events, declared that all members of the court must make a sacrifice themselves. Diocletian and Galerius also sent letters to the military command, demanding that the entire army perform the sacrifices or else face discharge. Since there are no reports of bloodshed in Lactantius's narrative, Christians in the imperial household must have survived the event.|$|E

40|$|Crossed {{conductance}} in hybrid Ferromagnet / Superconductor / Ferromagnet (FSF) structures {{results from}} the competition between normal transmission and Andreev reflection channels. Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) and elastic cotunneling (EC) between the ferromagnets are dressed by local Andreev reflections, which {{play an important role}} for transparent enough interfaces and intermediate spin polarizations. This modifies the simple result previously obtained at lowest order, and can explain <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crossed</b> resistances in a recent experiment [D. Beckmann et al., cond-mat/ 0404360].

40|$|We {{discuss a}} model of Ferromagnet / Superconductor / Ferromagnet (FSF) double {{junction}} in which the quasiparticles are not in equilibrium with the condensate in a region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superconductor containing the two FS contacts. <b>The</b> role <b>of</b> geometry is discussed, as well as <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> a small residual density <b>of</b> states within <b>the</b> superconducting gap, that allows a sequential tunneling crossed current. With elastic quasiparticle transport and the geometry with lateral contacts, <b>the</b> <b>crossed</b> conductances in <b>the</b> sequential tunneling channel are almost equal in the normal and superconducting phases, if {{the distance between the}} FS interfaces is sufficiently small.
