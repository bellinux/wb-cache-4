Since the usual or real {{communication system}}s {{are of a}} statistical nature, {{the performance of the}} system can never be described in a deterministic sense rather, it is always given in statistical terms. There are several close relationships between information sources and chaos because “chaos” is both of a deterministic and of a probabilistic nature. We review statistical properties of sequences of i. i. d. binary random variables (BRVs) generated by chaotic dynamics: (1) generation method of sequences of i. i. d.

30|$|Unlike passive cancelation, {{transmit}} waveform {{design is}} an active approach, capable of avoiding reserved bands occupied by interference inside the transmit band. One example is disjoint spectrum waveform (DSW), however, giving rise to high range sidelobes which cannot be suppressed by traditional spectral weighting. Thus, DSW design is necessary, to balance desired spectra with low sidelobes. Transmit and receive waveforms are designed separately in [15]. SCAN (stopband cyclic algorithm new) and radar-centric design are proposed in [16, 17]. However, DSW design algorithms do not work in an adaptive way.

At the transmitter, a block chip interleaving is employed to combat the deep fading over the wireless channels. At the receiver, a decorrelation scheme separates the combined signals to reduce the crosstalk between different applications, and provides a better estimation for the de-spreading sequence.

The main idea is that a switching scheme of the switched antenna array is designed according to a spreading sequence {{for the purpose of}} <b>spreading</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the transmit signal. The transmit signal is associated with the spreading sequence and the direction of the desired receiver because of information data modulated both in the baseband and the antenna level. In this way, the desired receiver with a single antenna can demodulate the receive signal as traditional spread-spectrum signal, while eavesdroppers can not extract any useful information from the receive signal even if eavesdroppers know the spreading sequence of the RF directional modulation signal. Simulation results show that the proposed technique offers a more secure transmission method for wireless communication comparison with traditional spread-spectrum signal. 1...|$|R
