25|$|In the 2003 revival {{starring}} Bernadette Peters, {{the final}} dialogue scene remains, but leaves the ending open to more interpretation from the audience. Louise {{walks through the}} stage door, with Rose following behind. Rose then turns to face the audience, a look of sadness and longing on {{her face as she}} takes one last look at the empty stage. <b>She</b> <b>pauses</b> and slowly closes the door.|$|E
25|$|As the {{questioning}} continues, Ingrid admits to Emma {{that she wants}} her {{to be part of}} her family, but then uses mind tactics on Emma to convince her that her family do not love her, they fear her. Emma denies this, but as <b>she</b> <b>pauses</b> for a second, Ingrid casts a spell on a glass of water, and when she returns Ingrid increases the pressure on Emma, resulting in the glass of water to boil as Emma's powers are unleashed due to her fear, causing the wall in the station to blast open and Ingrid to escape. Emma then walks out and as David, Mary Margaret, Hook, Elsa, Gold, and Belle show up to stop her, Emma wants everyone to stay away but when Hook touches her, Emma causes the streetlight to fall on David. Emma runs away after a horrified Mary Margret looks at her with disgust and gets into her car driving away even as Mary Margret calls after her that it's okay. Everyone present suspects that The Snow Queen/Ingrid has succeeded in turning Emma against them. After Elsa and Hook are unable to find Emma, Mary Margret blames herself, stating that no one wants their family to see them as a monster. Elsa reassures a fearful Hook that Emma will be fine, but that she needs time alone {{to come to terms with}} her powers, the way she did. Meanwhile, a terrified Emma sits in her parked bug in the woods overlooking the town.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> but her {{companion}} made no sign. <b>She</b> <b>paused</b> for so long, however, that speech became necessary.|$|R
60|$|Creeping {{along the}} {{passage to the}} library door, <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> and listened. Inside, there was a noise of footsteps, pacing {{up and down the}} room hurriedly. He had come to himself, then! He had slept off his drunken helplessness! <b>She</b> <b>paused</b> and listened again to hear further.|$|R
6000|$|Torfrida was on {{the point}} of saying, [...] "He has won it; let him wear it for my sake." [...] But <b>she</b> <b>paused.</b> <b>She</b> longed to see Hereward face to face; to speak to him, if but one word. If she allowed him to wear the favor, she must at least have the {{pleasure}} of giving it with her own hands. And <b>she</b> <b>paused.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Norma's mansion is {{subsequently}} {{filled with}} policemen and reporters. Now having completely {{lost touch with}} reality, she believes the newsreel cameras are there to film Salome. Max pretends {{to set up a}} scene for her and calls [...] "Action!" [...] As the cameras roll, Norma dramatically descends her grand staircase. <b>She</b> <b>pauses</b> and makes an impromptu speech about how happy she is to be making a film again, concluding with the famous line, [...] "All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up." ...|$|E

On her way to Richard's <b>she</b> <b>pauses</b> {{at the site of}} a film shoot, hoping {{to catch a glimpse of}} a movie star. Eventually she leaves, having not seen the star, embarrassed at her own trivial impulses. Clarissa enters the {{neighbourhood}} she and Richard frequented as young adults. It is revealed Richard and Clarissa once had a failed experimental romantic relationship together despite it being obvious Richard's [...] "deepest longings" [...] were for Louis with whom he was already in a relationship. Clarissa still wonders what her life might have been if they had tried to stay together. Clarissa enters Richard's apartment building, which she finds squalid. She seems to associate Richard's apartment building with sense of decay and death. She enters Richard's apartment.|$|E
6000|$|A {{river that}} from morn to night Down all the valley plays the fool; Not once <b>she</b> <b>pauses</b> in her flight, Nor knows {{the comfort of}} a pool; ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> {{for comment}} and congratulations, eyeing her {{companion}} expectantly.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> to meditate. Bashford was biting his lip impatiently.|$|R
60|$|His sister's cheeks flushed at the words, and <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> irresolute.|$|R
6000|$|TIMOTHY (looking at her fixedly. <b>She</b> <b>pauses</b> in her {{knitting}} {{and returns}} his look). Very well, ma'am--there's {{no need of}} my bothering you. You've heard nothing more of Mr. George? ...|$|E

60|$|FANNY [she turns--walks {{slowly back}} towards the tea-table. Halfway <b>she</b> <b>pauses,</b> and leaning {{over the back of}} a chair regards in silence for a while the {{portrait}} of the first Lady Bantock]. I do wish I could tell what you were saying.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> {{and looked}} towards Leo, as though {{awaiting}} his reply.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> {{and seemed}} to be {{referring}} the point to Staniford.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> {{and struck}} her {{shrunken}} hand sharply against the table.|$|R
6000|$|ANNYS [She puts on her cloak, {{moves towards}} the door. Half-way <b>she</b> <b>pauses,</b> makes a {{movement}} towards him. But {{he will not}} see. Then a hard look comes into her eyes, and without another word she goes out, leaving the door open.] ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pauses</b> {{and looks}} curiously {{from one to}} the other, as if {{weighing}} them. Morell, whose lofty confidence has changed into heartbreaking dread at Eugene's bid, loses all power of concealing his anxiety. Eugene, strung to the highest tension, does not move a muscle.|$|E
6000|$|... (Margaret enters from left, in {{flushed and}} happy pursuit of Tommy--for it {{is a game}} she is playing with him. She startles at sight of the three men, whom she first sees as she gains {{the side of the}} tea-table, where <b>she</b> <b>pauses</b> abruptly, resting one hand on the table.) ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> {{and then}} spoke hurriedly in a louder, {{pleading}} tone.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> for Jeff's face betrayed {{no signs}} of {{sympathetic}} following.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused,</b> for {{the room}} was vacant. Mrs. Conroy had disappeared.|$|R
6000|$|Unwillingly, Mrs. Crayford {{puts her}} book aside, {{and opens the}} piano--Mozart's [...] "Air in A, with Variations," [...] lies open on the instrument. One after another she plays the lovely melodies, so simply, so purely beautiful, of that unpretending and unrivaled work. At {{the close of the}} ninth Variation (Clara's favorite), <b>she</b> <b>pauses,</b> and turns toward the garden.|$|E
6000|$|A {{table is}} laid for tea. Ernest enters with the tea-urn. He leaves the door open; through it comes {{the sound of}} an harmonium, {{accompanying}} the singing of a hymn. Fanny comes from her dressing- room. She is dressed more cheerfully than when we last saw her, but still [...] "seemly." [...] She has a book in her hand. <b>She</b> <b>pauses,</b> hearing the music, goes nearer to the open door, and listens; then crosses and takes her place at the table. The music ceases.|$|E
6000|$|... [MRS. CHEVELEY starts; then bows with {{somewhat}} exaggerated politeness to LADY CHILTERN, {{who makes}} {{no sign of}} response. As she passes by SIR ROBERT CHILTERN, who is standing close to the door, <b>she</b> <b>pauses</b> {{for a moment and}} looks him straight in the face. She then goes out, followed by the servant, who closes the door after him. The husband and wife are left alone. LADY CHILTERN stands like some one in a dreadful dream. Then she turns round and looks at her husband. She looks at him with strange eyes, as though she were seeing him for the first time.] ...|$|E
60|$|The men cheered as <b>she</b> <b>paused</b> for {{a moment}} flushed and breathless.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> again. <b>She</b> {{seemed to}} think I ought to be impressed.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> {{and put her}} small, white hand on Sir Andrew's arm.|$|R
6000|$|The {{meeting is}} held in College Green and is very crowded, and Maud Gonne speaks, I think, {{standing}} upon a chair. In front of her is an old woman with a miniature of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, which she waves in her excitement, crying out, [...] "I was in it before she was born." [...] Maud Gonne tells how that morning {{she had gone to}} lay a wreath upon a martyr's tomb at St. Michael's Church, for it is the one day in the year when such wreaths are laid, but has been refused admission because it is the Jubilee. Then <b>she</b> <b>pauses,</b> and after that her voice rises to a cry, [...] "Must the graves of our dead go undecorated because Victoria has her Jubilee?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... (<b>She</b> <b>pauses.)</b> It {{has been}} a long fight, and I have been very tired, for always did I confront failure. My husband--I did not love him. I never loved him. I sold myself for the Cause, and the cause profited nothing. (Pause.) Often, I have lost faith--faith in everything, in God and man, in the hope of any righteousness ever prevailing. But again and again, by what you are doing, have you awakened me. I came to-night with no thought of self. I came to warn you, to help the good work on. I {{remained}}--thank God!--I remained to love you--and to be loved by you. I suddenly found myself, looking at you, very weary. I wanted you--you, {{more than anything in the}} world.|$|E
6000|$|MINNIE. Oh, I was a sinner, all right, they'll {{never get}} that out of their craniums. But being a sinner isn't a patch on being a scientist! It's nearly a year now since you took me in. The time's flown! When I was in the Pindar Shops, and in the Wire Works at Newcastle I could always beat the other girls to the Main Street when the whistle blew, but now I'm sorry when night comes. I can't hardly {{wait to get back}} here--honest to God! Say, Dr. Jonathan, I've found out one thing,--it's being in the right place that keeps {{a man or a woman}} straight. If you're in the wrong place, all the {{religion}} in the world won't help you. If you're doing work you like, that you've got an interest in, and that's some use, you don't need religion (<b>she</b> <b>pauses).</b> Why, that's religion,--it ain't preaching and praying and reciting creeds, it's doing--it's fun. There's no reason why religion oughtn't to be fun, is there? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> {{and shifted}} her chair, which had rocked close to mine.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> {{and wiped}} her brow. I sat still, and listened eagerly.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>paused</b> attentive, her ear turned {{towards the}} door of the kitchen.|$|R
