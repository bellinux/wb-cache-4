40|$|With the {{increasing}} demand from industries, the efficiency {{as well as the}} sustainability in extracting Rare Earth Elemnt (REE) from its main resources (mainly mining) has become very challenging. However, there is no specific study has been conducted particularly in optimizing the sequence of the extraction steps or reducing the complexity of separation stages when there are multiple choices of REE materials can be potentially extracted. In this light, this paper investigates the suitability of using the three main contributors of any Solvent Extraction (<b>SX)</b> <b>system</b> – separation factor value, material composition and number of processing stages (extraction and scrubbing), in specifically justifying the potential feasibility of the extraction pathways that has been initially selected for separation processing. In particular, the concept of Separation Index (SI) is introduced in correctly balancing the three corresponding factors of <b>SX</b> <b>system,</b> where ‘Art vs Science’ structure was used as the primary separation framework. In addition, two sets of Separation Factors - HDEHP-HCL and RE(III) -HCL-EHEHPA systems, are utilised to demonstrate the SI application. The results generally indicate that the proposed SI has sufficiently harmonizing the three main parameters of <b>SX</b> <b>system,</b> by which the low separation difficulty consists of the following criteria - relatively high SF value, relatively high material composition and relatively low number of stages. Through this work also, the ‘Árt vs Science’ is found favour the inter REE extraction rather than the intra separation. This is due to the chosen extractants generally shows low SF values mostly within the individual REE groups – light, medium and heavy REEs, respectively...|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of the doping dependence of the phase diagram of FeSe-based superconductors is still required {{due to the lack}} of a clean and systematic means of doping control. Here, we report on the magneto-optical imaging, thermodynamic and transport properties, as well as in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) studies, on the impurity scattering in stoichiometric FeSe single crystals. Co doping at the Fe site is found to decrease the superconducting transition temperature. The upper critical field and specific heat all indicate a possible multiband superconductivity with strong coupling in the Co-doped system. A remarkable feature in FeSe is that its temperature dependent resistivity exhibits a wide hump at high temperatures, a signature of a crossover from a semiconductinglike behavior to metallic behavior. A structural tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase transition Ts (a consequence of the electronic nematicity) is suppressed by either physical or chemical pressures. Due to the reconstruction of the Fermi surface at Ts, specific heat anomalies at Ts present ΔCp/Ts≈γn, the Sommerfield coefficient at low temperature. This reflects additional electronic instability in the FeSe(1 −x) <b>Sx</b> <b>system.</b> ARPES data between 180 and 282 K indicates the existence of a chemical potential shift with increasing thermal excitations, resulting in a change of the Fermi-surface topology and exhibiting a semimetal behavior. We found that the temperature-induced Lifshitz transition is much higher than the temperature for the nematic order. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Minor actinides were recovered from HLLW by ADvanced TRUEX flowsheet adopting salt-free reagents. Np was recovered by ADvanced PUREX flowsheet into the Pu-product fraction. Electrolytic extraction was prospective to separate several rare metals including some LLFPs from HLLW. CMPO/TBP/n-dodecane was decomposed by mediatory electrochemical oxidation, where major products of them were identified to be CO 2 and phosphoric acid. Medium and long term (~ 2030) scenario for TRU-LLFP recycling has been newly considered. 1 Long-lived nuclides separation system A dual solvent extraction (<b>SX)</b> <b>system</b> has been proposed for enhanced governance of actinides in the spent fuel for the coming back-end fuel cycle. In this scheme, actinides (U, Pu, Np) are separated from dissolver solution by ADvanced PUREX process. Residue of them and all of Am and Cm are additionally recovered from high level liquid waste (HLLW) by the ADvanced TRUEX process. By such an “actinides recycling”, high radiotoxicity of the vitrified HLLW during ultra long terms {{is expected to be}} lowered to permit the reduction of the human being's supervision. The proposed concept as an advanced reprocessing system is shown in Figure 1. While present research priority should be given to minor actinide separation, separation of fission products (FP) is necessary to further minimise hazard indexes of HLLW. This challenge will include to recover strategic platinum group elements (platinoides), technetium and the other rare metals as well as to separate long-lived fission products (LLFP). LLFP should be transmuted to shortlive or stable nuclides by fast reactor and/or another technics. Among the targets, three nuclides, 10...|$|R

This result is then applied to the problem of characterization of projective unital C∗-algebras. It is shown that a non-separable unital C∗-algebra X of density τ is projective if and only if it is the limit of a well ordered direct <b>system</b> <b>SX</b> = {Xα, iα+ 1 α, α < τ} of length τ, consisting of unital projective C∗-subalgebras Xα of X and doubly projective homomorphisms (inclusions) iα+ 1 α: Xα → Xα+ 1, α < τ, so that X 0 is separable and each iα+ 1 α, α < τ, has a separable type.

5000|$|Third parties {{offered a}} wide range of upgrades, for both <b>SX</b> and DX <b>systems.</b> The most popular ones were based on the Cyrix 486DLC/SLC core, which {{typically}} offered a substantial speed improvement due to its more efficient instruction pipeline and internal L1 SRAM cache. The cache was usually 1 kB, or sometimes 8 kB in the TI variant. Some of these upgrade chips (such as the 486DRx2/SRx2) were marketed by Cyrix themselves, but they were more commonly found in kits offered by upgrade specialists such as Kingston, Evergreen and Improve-It Technologies. Some of the fastest CPU upgrade modules featured the IBM SLC/DLC family (notable for its 16 kB L1 cache), or even the Intel 486 itself. Many 386 upgrade kits were advertised as being simple drop-in replacements, but often required complicated software to control the cache or clock doubling. Part of the problem was that on most 386 motherboards, the A20 line was controlled entirely by the motherboard with the CPU being unaware, which caused problems on CPUs with internal caches.|$|R
40|$|The {{atmospheric}} Unified Model (UM) {{developed at}} the UK Met Office is used for weather and climate prediction by forecast teams {{at a number of}} international meteorological centres and research institutes {{on a wide variety of}} hardware and software environments. Over its 25 year history the UM sources have been optimised for a better application performance on a number of HPC <b>systems</b> including NEC <b>SX</b> vector architecture <b>systems</b> and recently the IBM Power 6 /Power 7 platforms. Understanding the influence of the compiler flags, MPI libraries and run configurations is crucial to achieving the shortest elapsed times for a UM application on any particular HPC system. These aspects are very important for applications that must run within operational time frames. Driving the current study is the HPC industry trend since 1980 for processor arithmetic performance to increase at a faster rate than memory bandwidth. This gap has been growing especially fast for multicore processors in the past 10 years and it can have significant implication for the performance and performance scaling of memory bandwidth intensive applications, such as the UM. Analysis of partially used nodes on Intel Xeon clusters is provided in this paper for short and medium range weather forecasting systems using global and limited-area configurations. It is shown that on the Intel Xeon based clusters the fastest elapsed times and the most efficient system usage can be achieved using partially committed nodes...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} a geochemical {{comparison}} between the tourmaline hosted by metasomatic veins, cross-ing some pegmatite bodies from Romania and the so-called proto-pegmatitic tourmaline. In Romania, pegmatite bodies occur as veins and lenses in the medium-grade metamorphic terranes (micaschists, gneisses, migmatites etc.) of Southern, Western and Eastern Carpathians; generally, they have a simple mineralogy as follows: quartz, feldspars, muscovite as principal minerals, biotite, garnets and tourmaline as subordi-nate minerals. Pegmatites show a granite-like chemical com-position; genetically, {{it seems that the}} pegmatites formed by both metamorphic differentiation and anatectic processes (MÂRZA, 1980; MURARIU, 2001; STUMBEA, 2001). The study we carried out is based on electron microprobe analysis (major elements) performed on a CAMECA <b>SX</b> 50 -Link <b>Systems</b> device; the analysis focused on the rim {{as well as on the}} core of tourmaline grains. In terms of the variation of major elements from core to-ward the grain rim, a decrease of SiO 2, FeO and Na 2 O and an increase of Fe 2 O 3 and MgO has been found in metasomatic tourmaline; as for proto-pegmatitic tourmaline, the chemical composition of zoned grains showed a decrease of Al 2 O 3 and FeO and an increase of Fe 2 O 3, MgO and Na 2 O amounts from core toward the grain rim. The analyses performed on tourmaline grains show also some differences between the chemical features of me-tasomatic tourmaline cores/rims and those of proto-pegmatite core/rims. Thus, the core of metasomatic tourmaline has higher amounts of SiO 2 (36. 60 %), TiO 2 (0. 60 %), FeO (9. 00 %), MnO (0. 40 %), MgO (4. 50 %) and Na 2 O (2. 70 %) than the core of proto-pegmatite tourmaline (35. 30 % SiO 2...|$|R
