25|$|In realizing {{a breast}} lift, a {{conservative}} <b>surgical</b> <b>technique</b> produces the fewest, least visible scars after excising (cutting) excess folds of {{skin from the}} skin-envelope, when either replacing or rearranging or augmenting the internal breast tissues (parenchymal and adipose). Breast lift techniques are known according {{to the number of}} scars produced, which is related to the achievable degree of breast-lift. Pre-operatively, the patient and the surgeon decide upon the appropriate <b>surgical</b> <b>technique</b> (superior, medial, or inferior pedicle) that will achieve the best degree of breast lift. Generally, breast ptosis (sagging) is determined by the locale of the nipple-areola complex upon the breast; the lower the nipple-areola complex, the greater the degree of breast prolapsation (ptosis). Nonetheless, in breast-lift surgery, the primary consideration is the tissue viability of the nipple-areola complex, so that the outcome is a functionally sensate breast of natural size, contour, and feel.|$|E
25|$|Inframammary: an {{incision}} {{made to the}} inframammary fold (natural crease {{under your}} breast), which affords maximal access for precise dissection of the tissues and emplacement of the breast implants. It is the preferred <b>surgical</b> <b>technique</b> for emplacing silicone-gel implants, because it better exposes the breast tissue–pectoralis muscle interface; yet, IMF implantation can produce thicker, slightly more visible surgical scars.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{management}} of acute pulmonary embolism (pulmonary thrombectomy) is uncommon and {{has largely been}} abandoned because of poor long-term outcomes. However, recently, it {{has gone through a}} resurgence with the revision of the <b>surgical</b> <b>technique</b> and is thought to benefit certain people. Chronic pulmonary embolism leading to pulmonary hypertension (known as chronic thromboembolic hypertension) is treated with a surgical procedure known as a pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.|$|E

25|$|The Sugiura {{procedure}} is a <b>surgical</b> <b>technique</b> {{that involves the}} removal and transection of the blood vessels that supply the upper portion of the stomach and the esophagus. The procedure also involves a splenectomy. The operation was originally developed to treat bleeding esophageal varices (commonly a complication of liver cirrhosis) that were untreatable by other conventional methods. It was originally developed as a two-step operation, but has been modified numerous times by many surgeons since its original creation.|$|E
25|$|The {{technical}} goal of saline-implant {{technology was}} a physically less invasive <b>surgical</b> <b>technique</b> for emplacing an empty breast implant device through a smaller surgical incision. In surgical praxis, after having emplaced the empty breast implants to the implant pockets, the plastic surgeon then filled each device with saline solution, and, because the required insertion-incisions are short and small, the resultant incision-scars will be smaller and {{shorter than the}} surgical scars usual to the long incisions required for inserting pre-filled, silicone-gel implants.|$|E

50|$|Prior to 1925, the {{materials}} used in implant surgery were primarily relatively pure metals.

25|$|Historically, surgery {{provided}} the single approach to {{head and neck}} cancer. Surgical management of OPC carried significant morbidity with a transcervical (through the neck) approach, often involving mandibulotomy, in which the jawbone (mandible) is split. This {{is referred to as}} an open <b>surgical</b> <b>technique.</b> Consequently, surgical approaches declined in favour of radiation. In the United States, the use of surgery declined from 41% of cases in 1998 to 30% by 2009, the year that the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the newer techniques.|$|E
25|$|Urinary {{incontinence}} and vaginal prolapse {{are well}} known adverse effects that develop with high frequency {{a very long time}} after the surgery. Typically, those complications develop 10–20 years after the surgery. For this reason exact numbers are not known, and risk factors are poorly understood. It is also unknown if the choice of <b>surgical</b> <b>technique</b> has any effect. It has been assessed that the risk for urinary incontinence is approximately doubled within 20 years after hysterectomy. One long-term study found a 2.4 fold increased risk for surgery to correct urinary stress incontinence following hysterectomy.|$|E
25|$|The Renaissance saw {{significant}} {{advances in}} anatomy and <b>surgical</b> <b>technique.</b> However, {{despite all this}} progress, surgery remained a treatment of last resort. Largely because of the associated pain, many patients with surgical disorders chose certain death rather than undergo surgery. Although {{there has been a}} great deal of debate as to who deserves the most credit for the discovery of general anesthesia, it is generally agreed that certain scientific discoveries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were critical to the eventual introduction and development of modern anesthetic techniques.|$|E

25|$|Kitab al-Shamil is a {{book that}} went unpublished, but it gives insight into his view of {{medicine}} and human relations. His <b>surgical</b> <b>technique</b> had three stages. Step one was to give the patient information on how {{it was to be}} performed and the knowledge it was based on. The second step was to perform the surgery itself. The final step was to have a post-surgery appointment and a routine of checkups. There is also a description of a surgeon's responsibility when working with nurses, patients, or other surgeons.|$|E
25|$|Auditory canal {{decompression}} {{is another}} <b>surgical</b> <b>technique</b> that can prolong usable hearing when a vestibular schwannoma has grown {{too large to}} remove without damage to the cochlear nerve. In the IAC (internal auditory canal) decompression, a middle fossa approach is employed to expose the bony roof of the IAC without any attempt to remove the tumor. The bone overlying the acoustic nerve is removed, allowing the tumour to expand upward into the middle cranial fossa. In this way, pressure on the cochlear nerve is relieved, {{reducing the risk of}} further hearing loss from direct compression or obstruction of vascular supply to the nerve.|$|E
25|$|Advances made in <b>surgical</b> <b>technique</b> {{during the}} 18th century, such as John Hunter's {{research}} on tendon healing and Percival Pott's work on spinal deformity steadily increased {{the range of}} new methods available for effective treatment. Antonius Mathijsen, a Dutch military surgeon, invented the plaster of Paris cast in 1851. However, up until the 1890s, orthopedics was still a study limited to the correction of deformity in children. One of the first surgical procedures developed was percutaneous tenotomy. This involved cutting a tendon, originally the Achilles tendon, to help treat deformities alongside bracing and exercises. In the late 1800s and {{first decades of the}} 1900s, there was significant controversy about whether orthopedics should include surgical procedures at all.|$|E
