5|$|An osteological {{examination}} of the bones showed them to be in generally good condition and largely complete except for the missing feet, {{which may have been}} destroyed by Victorian building work. It was immediately apparent that the body had suffered major injuries, and further evidence of wounds was found as the skeleton was cleaned. The skull shows signs of two lethal injuries; the base {{of the back of the}} skull had been completely cut away by a bladed weapon, which would have exposed the brain, and another bladed weapon had been thrust through the right side of the skull, striking the inside of the left side through the brain. Elsewhere on the skull, a blow from a pointed weapon had penetrated the crown of the head. Bladed weapons had clipped the skull and sheared off layers of bone, without penetrating it. Other holes in the skull and lower jaw were found to be consistent with dagger wounds to the chin and cheek. The multiple wounds on the king’s skull indicated that he was not wearing his helmet, which he may have removed or lost when he was on foot after his horse had become stuck in the marsh. One of his right ribs had been cut by a <b>sharp</b> <b>implement,</b> as had the pelvis. There was no evidence of the withered arm that afflicted the character in William Shakespeare's play Richard III.|$|E

50|$|A {{peculiarity}} of this fungus {{lies in its}} use as {{a drawing}} medium for artists. When the fresh white pore surface is rubbed or scratched with a <b>sharp</b> <b>implement,</b> dark brown tissue under the pores is revealed, resulting in visible lines and shading that become permanent once the fungus is dried.|$|E
5000|$|Vests {{designed}} for bullets offer little protection against blows from <b>sharp</b> <b>implements,</b> such as knives, arrows or ice picks, or from bullets manufactured of non-deformable materials, e.g., those containing a steel core instead of lead. This {{is because the}} impact force of these objects stays concentrated in a relatively small area, allowing them to puncture the fiber layers of most bullet-resistant fabrics. [...] By contrast, stab vests provide better protection against <b>sharp</b> <b>implements,</b> but are generally less effective against bullets.|$|R

Often, <b>sharp</b> <b>implements</b> {{are attached to}} the legs of the birds, inflicting massive injuries and pain. The birds used for cockfighting sometimes are given stimulant drugs to enhance their fighting ability and make them more aggressive.|$|R
5000|$|Clonycavan Man is {{believed}} to have been murdered, based on an examination of the evidence found on his body by the Garda Technical Bureau (Irish Police Forensic Division). His skull was split open by a <b>sharp</b> <b>implement.</b> There is a deep wound on the top of his head, and parts of his brain have been found in this wound. There is also a large laceration across the bridge of his nose leading under his right eye. This {{is believed}} to be the blow that killed him. [...] Both injuries seem to have been caused by the same <b>sharp</b> <b>implement,</b> most likely an axe. His death {{is believed to}} be that of a ritual sacrifice. Radiocarbon dating has placed his death to between 392 BCE and 201 BCE, during the Iron Age of western Europe, making his remains around 2,300 years old.|$|E

50|$|I.P. <b>Sharp</b> <b>implemented</b> the new APL {{ideas in}} stages: complex numbers, {{enclosed}} (boxed) arrays, match, and composition operators in 1981, the determinant operator in 1982, and the rank operator, link, {{and the left}} and right identity functions in 1983. However, the domains of operators were still restricted to the primitive functions or subsets thereof. In 1986, IPSA developed SAX, SHARP APL/Unix, written in C and based on an implementation by STSC. The language was as specified in the dictionary with no restrictions on the domains of operators. An alpha version of SAX became available within I.P. Sharp around December 1986 or early 1987.|$|R

30|$|Penetrating {{injuries}} of {{the neck}} and face {{as a result of}} projectile (gun) and non-projectile (knives and other <b>sharp</b> <b>implements</b> such as screwdrivers or glass) mechanisms represent a significant source of acute admission of civilians to Accident and Emergency Departments and Trauma Units in the United Kingdom. This trend is reflected across the rest of Europe. Although accidental blunt trauma to the neck is a commoner cause of acute trauma presentation, national statistics for 2009 / 10 confirm a general progressive {{rise in the number of}} homicides involving knives and sharp instruments over the last five decades [1, 2]. In the United Kingdom, the number of actual bodily harm and grievous bodily harm offences involving a knife or sharp instrument have remained more or less constant between 2009 and 2010, accounting for 4  % of violent and sexual offences recorded by the police [1, 2]. Fatalities caused by a firearm in the United Kingdom (statistics for England and Wales) also remained constant between 2009 and 2010; however, serious injuries increased by 3  % between 2008 / 2009 and 2009 / 2010, with firearms offences geographically concentrated in the three most heavily populated police force areas and accounting for two-thirds of all such offences (recorded by the police).

50|$|Reverend Price {{suffered}} from an undiagnosed mental illness, acting erratically and experiencing fits of violent rage. He bathed either fully clothed or naked in local ponds, and collected snakes {{in his pockets}} {{for days at a}} time. Carrying a saw around, he removed bark from trees, then burning it while muttering certain words, also spitting onto stones, believing that it improved their value. His actions led to him becoming a threat to the local community, in one instance firing a gun at a woman whom he claimed was taking sticks from his hedgerow, and in another hurling a <b>sharp</b> <b>implement</b> at another man.|$|E
5000|$|A hashtag {{is a type}} of {{metadata}} tag used {{on social}} network and microblogging services, that do not support real category meta data, which makes it possible for users to still find messages with a specific theme or content. Users create and use hashtags by placing the number sign or pound sign (colloquially known as the hash character [...] in reference to its resemblance to several slices or chops with a <b>sharp</b> <b>implement)</b> in front of a word or unspaced phrase, either in the main text of a message or at the end. Searching for that hashtag will yield each message that has been tagged with it. A hashtag archive is consequently collected into a single stream under the same hashtag. For example, on the photo-sharing service Instagram, the hashtag #bluesky allows users to find all the posts that have been tagged using that hashtag.|$|E
5000|$|One of Allissa's and Otto's acts {{was titled}} [...] "The Russian Doll", a {{performance}} in which Otto presented a life scaled, three tiered Russian doll {{on stage and}} juggled the set to have finally revealed his wife contorted within {{the smallest of the}} dolls. After the success of this performance the pair were keen to develop their skills further. Amongst the Mander and Mitchenson archives; according to the Globe and Traveller evening newspaper an article was found, stating that in 1843 Otto and Allissa had devised a performance titled [...] "The Tin Canister Extravaganza" [...] in which Allissa would contort into a tin can whilst Otto would continue the performance by sealing the can with a lead solder provided by a Mr. Bryan Donking of the Donking Hall and Gamble Cannery in Bermondsey, South-East London. A terrible accident regarding a <b>sharp</b> <b>implement</b> used to break the lead seal left Allissa stuck within the canister.|$|E
5000|$|Earlier {{that night}} Williamson had {{told one of}} the parish constables {{that he had seen}} a man wearing a brown jacket lurking around the place and {{listening}} at his door. He asked the officer to {{keep an eye out for}} the stranger and arrest him. Not long afterwards the same constable heard a cry of [...] "Murder!" [...] As a crowd gathered outside The King's Arms a nearly naked man descended from the upper floor using a rope of knotted sheets. As he dropped to the street, he was crying incoherently. He was John Turner, a lodger and journeyman who had been there for some eight months.The crowd forced the tavern doors open and saw the body of John Williamson lying face up on the steps leading into the taproom. His head had been beaten and his throat had been cut, and there was an iron crowbar lying at his side. While the crowbar appeared to be the weapon used to beat him, a <b>sharper</b> <b>implement</b> had been used to slit his throat and nearly hack off his hand. Elizabeth Williamson and the maid were found in the parlour, their skulls smashed and their throats cut. The maid's feet were beneath the grate, as if she had been struck down while preparing the fire for the next morning. Her mistress's neck had been severed to the bone.|$|R
50|$|Banana {{and palm}} leaves were {{historically}} the primary writing surface in many nations of South and Southeast Asia. This has influenced {{the evolution of}} their scripts. The rounded letters {{of many of the}} scripts of southern India (such as Oriya and Sinhala), of Burmese, and of Javanese, for example, are thought to have been influenced by this: Sharp angles and tracing straight lines along the vein of the leaf with a <b>sharp</b> writing <b>implement</b> would risk splitting the leaf and ruining the surface, so rounded letters, or letters with straight lines only in the vertical or diagonal direction, were required for practical daily use.|$|R
5000|$|Shiv (possibly {{from the}} Romani word chivomengro, [...] "knife"), also chiv, is a slang term for any <b>sharp</b> or pointed <b>implement</b> {{used as a}} knife-like weapon. The Oxford English Dictionary {{suggests}} shive, a razor, documented in 1915, as the root word. [...] In the 1920s, [...] "shiv" [...] was also a common slang term for a bladed weapon, mostly a knife. In the United States, an improvised prison knife is also often called a shank.|$|R
50|$|Four allotropes of {{antimony}} are known: {{a stable}} metallic form and three metastable forms (explosive, black and yellow). Elemental antimony is a brittle, silver-white shiny metalloid. When slowly cooled, molten antimony crystallizes in a trigonal cell, isomorphic with the gray allotrope of arsenic. A rare explosive form of antimony can be formed from the electrolysis of antimony trichloride. When scratched with a <b>sharp</b> <b>implement,</b> an exothermic reaction occurs and white fumes are given off as metallic antimony forms; when rubbed with a pestle in a mortar, a strong detonation occurs. Black antimony is formed upon rapid cooling of antimony vapor. It {{has the same}} crystal structure as red phosphorus and black arsenic, it oxidizes in air and may ignite spontaneously. At 100 °C, it gradually transforms into the stable form. The yellow allotrope of antimony is the most unstable. It has only been generated by oxidation of stibine (SbH3) at −90 °C. Above this temperature and in ambient light, this metastable allotrope transforms into the more stable black allotrope.|$|E
50|$|Scratchboard itself comes {{either with}} a paper (cardboard) backing, or a {{hardboard}} support. While the cardboard does have its uses, {{as it can be}} easily cut into size, the hardboard is much superior, giving greater stability to the work, being able to be corrected more often. It is more durable and easier to scratch into for cleaner, crisper details and lines. Several tools have been created specifically for scratchboard; however any <b>sharp</b> <b>implement</b> will do though a range of blades of different thicknesses allows the removal of more or less of the ink at will (see variety of tools listed below). Isopropyl Alcohol on a cotton swab or cotton ball, sandpaper and non-oily, fine, steel wool are also useful for removing large areas, and creating texture. Coloring scratchboard, black or white boards, can be done with many mediums applied with paint brush, air brush, and even cotton balls. Special scratchboard colored inks, made by ampersand, can be added to the white areas and then scratched again for additional highlights and volume for added dimension.|$|E
5000|$|Shanidar 3 was a 40- to 50-year-old male, {{found in}} the same grave as Shanidar 1 and 2. A wound to the left 9th rib {{suggests}} that the individual died of complications from a stab wound by a <b>sharp</b> <b>implement.</b> Bone growth around the wound indicates that Shanidar 3 lived for at least several weeks after the injury with the object still embedded. The angle of the wound rules out self-infliction, but is consistent with an accidental or purposeful stabbing by another individual. Recent {{research has suggested that}} the injury may have been caused by a long range projectile. This would be the earliest example of inter-personal or inter-specific violence in the human fossil record and the only such example amongst Neanderthals. The presence of early-modern humans, possibly armed with projectile weapons, in western Asia around the same time also raises the possibility of inter-species conflict. Shanidar 3 also suffered from a degenerative joint disorder (DJD) in his foot resulting from a fracture or sprain, which would have resulted in painful, limited movement. The skeleton is on display at the Hall of Human Origins at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{establish}} whether "assisted self-harm" is ethical or moral, when used in adult acute inpatient environments; in other words, whether it is consistent with how people should live their lives and treat others. "Assisted self-harm" refers to management strategies for self-harm which strive to reduce/limit, rather than stop, the behaviour. Strategies include offering advice on safer places to injure or allowing/providing <b>sharp</b> <b>implements.</b> In the project I used an "empirical ethics" approach, combining philosophical analysis with empirical studies to produce normative, not descriptive, conclusions. I conducted individual qualitative interviews with 5 patients and 20 inpatient or home intervention mental health professionals. Two focus groups were conducted: (I) with people from adult community services (n= 4); and (2) with people from a specialist service for personality disorder (n= 12). The interviews provided descriptive data about people's motivations, reasons and intentions when they self-injure, as well as predictive data about the possible consequences of allowing injury and participant-driven arguments for or against the approach. This data was used to complement theoretical analysis of the key concepts "autonomy", "responsibility" and "harm" and was integrated into my own arguments, to provide recommendations for action. Based on the combined analysis, I argue that "assisted self-harm" is justifiable in the shortterm {{as a means to}} reduce long-term harm, provided that five conditions are met. Thus, where the patient: is using self-injury primarily to manage distress; is injuring in a way which is associated with a low probability of physical damage (given the presence of appropriate support, such as advice on technique); possesses sufficient mental acuity after injury to engage with therapy; has an honest and open relationship with staff who are familiar with their history; and is capable of injuring in private, then "assisted self-harm" m. ay be an appropriate and effective approach.

40|$|Stabbing is {{the most}} common way of {{committing}} murder in the UK. <b>Sharp</b> <b>implements</b> are used in stabbing attacks with the intent to cause injury and death. The number of deaths that result from stabs is high, partly because major organs and major blood vessels are relatively close to the skin and easily penetrated. Knight in the late 1970 s used a spring loaded device to make stab tests into cadavers. He concluded that skin was easily penetrated by sharp knives and that skin offered the most resistance to penetration, with underlying fat and muscle requiring less force to penetrate. Knight concluded that the sharpness of the tip was {{the most important factor in}} determining whether a knife penetrated. Various other investigators have since investigated the effect of skin and various skin simulants, concluding that most items of clothing are easily penetrated by a knife, and considered how the geometry of the knife affects it sharpness. This thesis has looked at the effect of clothing on forces required for stabbing and the use of glass bottles as impulsive weapons. It has been found that clothing does influence the force required for stabbing. For the glass bottles it was found that there was no simple method for predicting how sharp a particular bottle would be once it was fractured. A novel dynamometer has been developed to accurately mimic a stabbing event and record the forces generated. The data shows that there are considerable differences in the forces generated by males and females; discernable differences between the dominant and non-dominant hand and that stabbing, even with blunt weapons can cause considerable penetration in most cases. The data also shows that the traditional ranking of mild, moderate and severe used by forensic pathologists lacks meaning in interpreting stabbing events...|$|R

40|$|The {{vertical}} transport of nonequilibrium charge carriers through semiconductor heterostructures {{has led to}} milestones in electronics {{with the development of}} the hot-electron transistor. Recently, significant advances have been made with atomically <b>sharp</b> heterostructures <b>implementing</b> various two-dimensional materials. Although graphene-base hot-electron transistors show great promise for electronic switching at high frequencies, they are limited by their low current gain. Here we show that, by choosing MoS 2 and HfO 2 for the filter barrier interface and using a noncrystalline semiconductor such as ITO for the collector, we can achieve an unprecedentedly high-current gain (α ∼ 0. 95) in our hot-electron transistors operating at room temperature. Furthermore, the current gain can be tuned over 2 orders of magnitude with the collector-base voltage albeit this feature currently presents a drawback in the transistor performance metrics such as poor output resistance and poor intrinsic voltage gain. We anticipate our transistors will pave the way toward the realization of novel flexible 2 D material-based high-density, low-energy, and high-frequency hot-carrier electronic applications. © 2015 American Chemical Society...|$|R

50|$|Cutting is a {{compressive}} and shearing phenomenon, and occurs {{only when}} the total stress generated by the cutting implement exceeds the ultimate strength of the material of the object being cut. The simplest applicable equation is stress = force/area: The stress generated by a cutting implement is directly proportional to the force with which it is applied, and inversely proportional {{to the area of}} contact. Hence, the smaller the area (i.e., the <b>sharper</b> the cutting <b>implement),</b> the less force is needed to cut something. It is generally seen that cutting edges are thinner for cutting soft materials and thicker for harder materials. This progression is seen from kitchen knife, to cleaver, to axe, and is a balance between the easy cutting action of a thin blade vs strength and edge durability of a thicker blade.|$|R
