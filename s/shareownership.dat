40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between director <b>shareownership</b> and corporate performance in South Africa using a sample of 169 listed firms from 2002 to 2007. Our results suggest a statistically significant and positive association between director <b>shareownership</b> and corporate performance. By contrast, we find {{no evidence of a}} non-linear effect of director <b>shareownership</b> on corporate performance. Our findings are robust across a raft of econometric models that control for different types of endogeneity problems and corporate performance proxies. Overall, our results provide support for agency theory, which suggests that director <b>shareownership</b> can reduce agency problems by aligning more closely the interests of shareholders and corporate executives, and thereby improving corporate performance. ...|$|E
40|$|The rise {{in private}} <b>shareownership</b> {{has been a}} {{striking}} feature of Australia’s political economy over the last decade. This paper compares its implications with those arising from the widespread homeownership, that occurred from the Menzies years onwards. Noting an apparent similarity between Menzies ’ vision of Australia as a ‘home owning democracy ’ and Howard’s encouragement of Australians {{to see themselves as}} members of a ‘share owning democracy, ’ Troy (2000 : 736) points out that Howard: does not seem to recognise that there are significant differences in the levels of citizen competence between the two conceptions. In his notion of a home owning democracy Menzies lauded notions of security, continuity, predictability and community whereas the notion of a share owning democracy implies a more mobile, speculative response to society and its fabric. As Troy (2000) observes, the Coalition would not advance policies on private <b>shareownership</b> without the hope of electoral advantage. This expectation in itself is worth attention, since it has been little studied in the literature. The electoral implications of increased <b>shareownership</b> in Australia are a primary concern of this paper. In addition, we test Troy’s suggestions that homeownership and <b>shareownership</b> imply very different expressions of ‘social citizenship ’ or ‘civic engagement ’ and that <b>shareownership</b> may ‘weaken ’ rather than ‘deepen ’ the quality of community life (Howard 1999) ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{hypothesis}} that governments structure privatization offerings to ensure full subscription and a broad distribution of <b>shareownership.</b> Our literature survey of IPO markets suggests that governments face IPO markets characterized by both information asymmetry and demand uncertainty. Operating in this environment, governments design complex allocation schemes that ration shares among individual investors to achieve broad share distribution and rely on institutional investors to fully subscribe the offering. ^ We test our hypotheses on the 40 companies privatized during the U. K. program. We show that the allocation schemes designed by the U. K. government resulted in offerings that were segmented into retail and institutional tranches {{and that there was}} heavy rationing in the retail tranche. Empirical evidence on the allocations and returns for various investor categories support our hypotheses on full subscription and broad distribution of <b>shareownership.</b> If small applicants had invested 1000 pounds in every offering they would have made a return of 130 pounds in the first day of trading. Very large institutions that bid for at least 0. 5 percent of the offering were also clearly favored and made a 29 percent return. ^ We also examine the effects of these allotment schemes on the long-run performance of privatized stocks and compare it to the long-run performance of IPO stocks in the United Kingdom. The results indicate that privatized stocks do not exhibit any abnormal performance in the initial 36 month period after the offering. However, the 176 offer for sale IPOs do exhibit long-run underperformance. ^ Lastly, we provide some anecdotal evidence on privatization offerings in France, Malaysia, and Spain. These data seem to suggest that these offerings were also segmented into retail and institutional tranches and that the retail tranche was heavily oversubscribed. Thus our hypotheses on government behavior appear to be valid across privatization programs. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} impact of {{management}} characteristics and patterns of collaboration on a firm’s innovation performance in transforming innovation resources into commercially successful outputs. These questions are investigated using a recent firm level survey database for 465 innovative British small and medium enterprises (SMEs) over the years 1998 - 2001. Both Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) are employed to benchmark a firm’s innovative efficiency against best practice. Quality and the variety of innovations {{are taken into account}} by combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with DEA. We find evidence suggesting that the innovative efficiency of SMEs is significantly affected by their management characteristics and collaboration behaviour. Collaboration, organisational flexibility, formality in management systems and incentive schemes are found to contribute significantly to a firm’s innovative efficiency. Managerial <b>shareownership</b> also shows some positive effect. The importance of these effects, however, varies across different sectors. WE find that innovative efficiency i...|$|E
40|$|While intercorporate <b>shareownership</b> {{is common}} among {{publicly}} traded firms, systematic empirical evidence {{on this particular}} aspect of corporate ownership structure is sparse. Based largely on aggregated ownership data provided by various stock exchanges, we know that intercorporate holdings represent a relatively large proportion (above 40 %) of the total equity value of exchange- listed firms in Japan and Germany, and a relatively low proportion (less than 10 %) in the U. S. and the U. K. Thus, the Anglo-American corporate governance system appears to produce substantially lower levels of intercorporate shareholdings than does the German– Japanese governance model. While financial institutions in Germany and Japan play an integral role in the governance structures of those countries, securities laws inspired by early populist sentiments in the U. S. have prevented American financial institutions from playing a similar active role. 1 Much like the Anglo-American system, securities laws in Norway, the empirical laboratory of Bøhren and Norli (1997), also restrict the equity ownership and direct corporate governance participation of financial institutions. Perhaps {{as a result the}} level of intercorporat...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{the findings of}} {{an examination of the}} relationship between internal corporate governance structures and the financial performance of South African listed firms. Specifically, using a sample of 100 South African listed firms from 2002 to 2006 (a total of 500 firm-year observations) and corporate governance data collected directly from company annual reports, the thesis seeks to ascertain whether better-governed listed firms tend to be associated with higher financial returns than their poorly-governed counterparts. Unlike prior studies, the internal corporate governance-financial performance nexus is investigated by applying both the compliance-index and equilibrium-variable research methodologies. The results based on the compliance-index model suggest that there is a statistically significant and positive association between the quality of the sampled firms’ internal corporate governance structures and their financial performance. This finding is robust whether an accounting (return on assets) or a market (Tobin’s Q) based measure of financial performance is used. Distinct from prior studies, an analysis of the impact of complying with the South African context specific affirmative action and stakeholder corporate governance provisions on the financial performance of South African listed firms is also investigated. The results indicate that compliance with the affirmative action and stakeholder corporate governance provisions impacts positively on the performance of South African listed firms. By contrast, the results based on the equilibrium-variable model are generally mixed. First, regardless of the financial performance measure used, board diversity, the frequency of board meetings, and the establishment of board committees except the presence of a nomination committee seem to have no impact on firm financial performance. Second, board size is statistically significant and positively associated with Tobin’s Q (Q-ratio), but statistically insignificant and negatively related to return on assets (ROA). Third, role or CEO duality is statistically significant and positively related to ROA, but statistically insignificant and negatively associated with the Q-ratio. Director <b>shareownership</b> is statistically insignificant and positively related to ROA, but statistically significant and negatively associated with the Q-ratio. Finally, the findings based on both the director <b>shareownership</b> squared and cubed do not support the statistically significant non-linear director shareownership-financial performance association reported by Morck et al. (1988). The findings from a series of robustness or sensitivity analyses carried out suggest that the empirical results reported are generally robust to potential endogeneity problems.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we show, in an {{incomplete}} contracts framework that combines asymmetric information and moral hazard, that by permitting insiders {{to trade on}} personal account the equilibrium level of output can be increased and shareholder welfare can be improved. There are two reasons for this. First, insider trading impounds information regarding {{the costs and benefits}} of effort and perk consumption into asset prices, which allows shareholders to choose more efficient portfolio allocations. Second, allowing insider trading can induce managers to increase their stake in the firm beyond that obtained through bargaining with shareholders. This effect leads to a reduction in managerial perk consumption and/or increased managerial effort. Insider trading can also be costly for shareholders' intermediate range of monitoring costs and project difficulty because, in such cases, the efforts of managers are quite sensitive to the exact level of fractional <b>shareownership,</b> which managers can endogenously change if they are able to trade on personal account. Interestingly, when monitoring and effort costs are low, managers may prefer restrictions on their ability to trade as such restrictions will force shareholders to offer them a larger fraction of output.

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} studies of dividend taxation have found that: (1) dividend tax cuts cause large, immediate increases in dividend payouts, and (2) the increases {{are driven by}} firms {{with high levels of}} <b>shareownership</b> among top executives or the board of directors. These findings are inconsistent with existing "old view" and "new view" theories of dividend taxation. We propose a simple alternative theory of dividend taxation in which managers and shareholders have conflicting interests, and show that it can explain the evidence. Using this agency model, we develop an empirically implementable formula for the efficiency cost of dividend taxation. The key determinant of the efficiency cost is the nature of private contracting. If the contract between shareholders and the manager is second-best efficient, deadweight burden follows the standard Harberger formula and is second-order (small) despite the pre-existing distortion of over-investment by the manager. If the contract is second-best inefficient [...] as is likely when firms are owned by diffuse shareholders because of incentives to free-ride when monitoring managers [...] dividend taxation generates a first-order (large) efficiency cost. An illustrative calibration of the formula using empirical estimates from the 2003 dividend tax reform in the U. S. suggests that the efficiency cost of raising the dividend tax rate could be close to the amount of revenue raised. ...|$|E

40|$|Analysis of the 2003 Australian Survey of Social Attitudes verifies {{claims that}} Australia is a share-owning democracy. We show that higher income earners {{are most likely}} to own shares and to own shares in a large number of companies, and that the 45 – 54 and 54 – 56 year age groups are the peak for ownership. We also {{investigate}} ethical issues relating to <b>shareownership</b> by examining scenarios under which owners would sell their shares. Ethical concern is highest on the issue of child labour. Yet there is surprisingly little concern amongst shareowners over racial discrimination, which was less likely to lead to the sales of shares than investment in genetically modified crops or foods, paying large bonuses to executives or the production of military weapons. Women are {{more likely than men to}} adopt an “ethical” stance on share ownership across all scenarios, although high income earners are less likely to sell shares in the face of racial discrimination or the production of military weapons by their companies. Postmaterialists are just as likely as materialists to own shares, but much more likely to sell them for ethical reasons, while those on the “left” of politics appear to be more ethical than the “right”. Finally, owning shares in several companies reduces the likelihood of ethical behaviour, with those owning shares in six or more companies least likely to sell for any ethical reason...|$|E
