40|$|The multidrug {{resistance}} proteins MRP 1 and MRP 2 {{are members of}} the same subfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters. Besides organic molecules conjugated to negatively charged ligands, these proteins also transport cytotoxic drugs for which no negatively charged conjugates are known to exist. In polarized MDCKII cells, MRP 1 routes to the lateral plasma membrane, and MRP 2 to the apical plasma membrane. In these cells MRP 1 transports daunorubicin, and MRP 2 vinblastine; both transporters export reduced glutathione (GSH) into the medium. We demonstrate that glutathione transport in MDCKII-MRP 1 cells is inhibited by the inhibitors of organic anion transporters <b>sulfinpyrazone,</b> indomethacin, probenecid and benzbromarone. In MDCKII-MRP 2 cells, GSH export is stimulated by low concentrations of <b>sulfinpyrazone</b> or indomethacin, whereas export is inhibited down to control levels at high concentrations. We find that unmodified <b>sulfinpyrazone</b> is a substrate for MRP 2, also at concentrations where GSH export is inhibited. We also show that GSH export in MDCKII-MRP 2 cells increases in the presence of vinblastine, and that the stochiometry between drug and GSH exported is between two and three. Our data indicate that transport of <b>sulfinpyrazone</b> and vinblastine is associated with GSH export. However, at high <b>sulfinpyrazone</b> concentrations this compound is transported without GSH. Models of MRP action are discussed that could explain these results. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E

In 136 studies the agents were given twice daily by oral administration both singly and in combination. The antithrombotic efficacy {{of a given}} therapy was determined by its capacity to interrupt steady-state platelet utilization induced by thrombogenic arteriovenous cannulae. When given alone, dipyridamole and <b>sulfinpyrazone</b> reduced {{the rate at which}} platelets were utilized by thrombus formation in a dose-dependent manner with essentially complete interruption by dipyridamole at 10 mg/kg per d. In contrast, neither aspirin (2 - 100 mg/kg per d) nor dazoxiben (20 - 100 mg/kg per d) decreased cannula platelet consumption detectably despite the striking reduction in the capacity of platelets to produce thromboxane B 2. However, aspirin, but not dazoxiben, potentiated the antithrombotic effects of dipyridamole and <b>sulfinpyrazone</b> in a dose-dependent fashion without changing the pharmacokinetics for any of the agents. Complete potentiation required aspirin at 20 mg/kg per d to be given with each dose of dipyridamole. Because dazoxiben's blockade of platelet thromboxane A 2 production was not associated with antithrombotic potentiation, and because complete potentiation by aspirin required a dose that fully inhibited vascular production of prostaglandin I 2 (PGI 2), we conclude that aspirin's potentiating effect on dipyridamole is independent of PGI 2 production or inhibition of thromboxane A 2 formation.
