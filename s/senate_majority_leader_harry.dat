This was due to <b>Senate</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>Harry</b> Reid and other Democratic leaders cutting the vice president out of any direct talks with Congress, feeling that Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations.|$|E

5000|$|The {{proposed}} legislation {{was backed by}} the Obama administration. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar stated [...] "There is a new administration in town, {{and we want to}} see the 1872 mining law reformed." [...] However, in 2010, <b>Senate</b> <b>majority</b> <b>leader,</b> Senator <b>Harry</b> Reid (D-NV), who was thought to oppose the bill as written, announced that, due to other legislative priorities, the bill would not be acted upon before Congress adjourned, and so the bill died {{at the end of the}} 111th United States Congress in January 2011.|$|R
5000|$|The bill's sole sponsor in the <b>Senate</b> was <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>Harry</b> Reid, {{though it}} was crafted in large part {{as a result of}} efforts by Senators Kennedy, McCain and Kyl, along with Senator Lindsey Graham, and input from President George W. Bush, who {{strongly}} supported the bill. For that reason it was referred to in the press by various combinations of these five men's names, most commonly [...] "Kennedy-Kyl". A larger group of senators was involved in creating the bill, sometimes referred to as the 'Gang of 12'. Senator David Vitter of Louisiana led the opposition to the bill, clashing with McCain and Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{numerous}} calls by Democrats, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Speaker of the House and <b>Senate</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> Sen. <b>Harry</b> Reid (D-NV), Putnam became the top Republican in either house {{to call for}} the ouster of former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. [...] "For {{the good of the}} nation, I think it is time for fresh leadership at the Department of Justice", Putnam said. This was met with surprise by many Republicans, who were remaining silent on the Gonzales issue. However, Putnam mentioned that there remained severe discontent within the GOP circle over Gonzales and as the Chairman of the House Republican Conference, he thought {{that it was important to}} send this message out.|$|R
25|$|Soon {{after the}} verdict, calls for Libby to be pardoned by President George W. Bush {{began to appear}} in some newspapers; some of them were posted online by the Libby Legal Defense Trust (LLDT). U.S. <b>Senate</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>Harry</b> Reid issued a press release about the verdict, urging Bush to pledge not to pardon Libby, and other Democratic {{politicians}} followed his lead.|$|E
25|$|In December 2012, McConnell {{called for}} a vote on giving the {{president}} unilateral authority to raise the federal debt ceiling. When <b>Senate</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>Harry</b> Reid (D-NV) {{called for a}}n up or down vote, McConnell objected to the vote and ended up filibustering it himself. In 2014, McConnell voted to help break Ted Cruz's filibuster attempt against a debt limit increase and then against the bill itself.|$|E
25|$|Under Schumer, in the 2006 elections, the Democratic Party gained six {{seats in}} the senate, {{defeating}} incumbents {{in each of those}} races and regaining control of the senate {{for the first time since}} 2002.

50|$|Flake {{used his}} {{experience}} surviving {{in the wild}} for six days with a Democratic Senator to develop an idea to end partisan gridlock in Washington. Flake and U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM) were featured on a Discovery Channel reality TV show, Rival Survival, where the two stayed on a small Micronesian island for six days. Flake later joked during {{a speech at the}} National Press Club that sending both <b>Senate</b> <b>leaders</b> (<b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> Senator <b>Harry</b> Reid D-NV and Republican Mitch McConnell R-KY) to a remote island together might reduce partisanship and allow more legislation to move forward.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the bill}} {{arrived on the}} floor of the <b>Senate,</b> Democrat and <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>Harry</b> Reid called the {{proposal}} [...] "one of the worst pieces of legislation to ever be placed {{on the floor of}} the United States Senate." [...] On July 22, 2011, the Senate voted to table the bill (postpone consideration of the bill indefinitely). Voting precisely followed party lines, with 51 Democrats voting to table the bill and 46 Republicans voting to bring it up for debate. One media commentator stated that: [...] "The vote handed conservatives a chance to showcase their strategy for restricting future spending in Washington, but it faced a veto from President Barack Obama, making it more of a symbolic vote for Republicans to put their mark on deficit reduction".|$|R
2500|$|Cruz was {{involved}} with the October 2013 government shutdown. Cruz gave a 21-hour Senate speech {{in an effort to}} hold up a federal budget bill and therefore defund the Affordable Care Act. Cruz persuaded the House of Representatives and House Speaker John Boehner to include an ACA defunding provision in the bill. In the U.S. <b>Senate,</b> former <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>Harry</b> Reid <b>Senate,</b> blocked the filibuster attempt because only eighteen Republican Senators supported the filibuster. To supporters, the move [...] "signaled the depth of Cruz's commitment to rein in government". This move was extremely popular among Cruz supporters, with Rick Manning of Americans for Limited Government naming Cruz [...] "2013 Person of the Year" [...] in an op-ed in The Hill, for primarily his filibuster against the Affordable Care Act. Cruz was also named [...] "2013 Man of the Year" [...] by conservative publications TheBlaze, FrontPage Magazine and The American Spectator, [...] "2013 Conservative of the Year" [...] by Townhall.com, and [...] "2013 Statesman of the Year" [...] by the Republican Party of Sarasota County, Florida. He was a finalist for Time magazine's [...] "Person of the Year" [...] in 2013. To critics, including some Republican colleagues such as Senator Lindsey Graham, the move was ineffective.|$|R

25|$|In two {{separate}} forum assemblies in October 2007, BYU also hosted US <b>Senate</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>Harry</b> Reid (a Democrat) and U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts as forum speakers.

Roberts spoke about the powers and limitations placed on the federal judiciary by the United States Constitution.|$|E
25|$|With Republican President George W. Bush term limited, the Republicans {{nominated}} Senator John McCain of Arizona for the presidency.

In the Congressional elections, Democrats added to their majorities in both houses of Congress, and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and <b>Senate</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>Harry</b> Reid both remained in their posts. Republicans John Boehner and Mitch McConnell continued to serve as House Minority Leader and Senate Minority Leader, respectively.|$|E

25|$|Senate leaders {{argued that}} Senate Rule 2 {{requires}} a senator-designate's credentials {{to be signed}} by the state's governor and secretary of state.
