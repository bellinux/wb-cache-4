5000|$|The {{winter of}} 1849 brought Kit Carson {{and his company}} of trappers to the Cache la Poudre where they set up camp. In 1860 a town company was organized.

In 1862, the town of Colona changed its name to LaPorte, and was named the headquarters of the Mountain Division of the Overland Trail Stage Route. The first post office opened, and a stage stop was built on the Overland Trail. A station was erected right along the river, very near where the present Overland Trail crosses the river.
