Therefore, depending on the <b>speed</b> of the <b>capsule,</b> some of the neighboring frames might contain high overlap or very small overlap between frames. Hence, the quality of the interpolated image depends on the degree of overlap and needs to be evaluated for medical decision-making process.

30|$|A few {{important}} issues {{pertaining to the}} operation of such in-body networks are discussed as follow. First, the objective is for health monitoring inside the human body, so safety and reliability are serious considerations. Safety and reliability must not be compromised even if higher cost is induced. Secondly, the frequency for power detection {{is dependent on the}} speed of the mobile sensors. If it is slow compared with the <b>speed</b> of <b>capsules,</b> then the path-loss may vary very much and the calculated transmit power becomes inaccurate. This inaccuracy will cause transmit power variations where; when it is set too small, it will cause packet loss; otherwise when it is set too high, it will result in energy wastage. Thirdly, the latency for the proposed TDMA is quite long. There are two reasons for this characteristic. One is the multi-hop communication and the other is the TDMA frame pattern. Further optimization for reducing the average end-to-end delay is expected and will be explored in future work. Finally, this article proposed a novel medium access solution for wireless capsule networks inside GI tract. This can also be a reference for the future complex body sensor networks. The future works would focus on optimizing power detection frequency and reducing the average end-to-end delay.|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} 20 years, many {{accidents}} in offshore {{oil and gas}} industry have taken away the lives of many workers. A new type of evacuation system is introduced in this research. Whereas, all other evacuation systems developed were purposely designed to remove an entire crew from a structure during emergencies, this research describes the development of a high <b>speed</b> escape <b>capsule</b> that could remove a single person from the structure. Capsules would be placed at strategic locations {{on the deck of the}} structure. During an emergency each capsule would be catapulted from the deck to the ocean surface. To avoid the effect of strong wind and waves, after impact with the ocean surface, the capsule would sink into the ocean down to a level where water motions are insignificant and wait until the storm subsides. This research focuses only on the post impact trajectory of the capsule beneath the ocean surface. A physical model of the capsule was designed. Two front thrusters were used to generate surge and yaw motions. Heave and pitch motions were controlled by another thruster located at the back. A pressure transducer was used to measure depth, and a digital compass was used to determine direction. A Peripheral Interface Controller (PIC) was used to control the motion of the capsule using an I²C bus to send PWM signals to 20 Amp drivers. A SIMULINK model was developed to study control strategies and the influence of various vehicle parameters. The model capsule was tested in the Deep Water Tank in Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science at Memorial University of Newfoundland and in the Offshore Engineering Basin at the Institute for Ocean Technology.

40|$|NASA s {{development}} of new concepts for the Crew Exploration Vehicle Orion presents many similar challenges to those worked in the sixties during the Apollo program. However, with improved modeling capabilities, new challenges arise. For example, {{the use of the}} commercial code LS-DYNA, although widely used and accepted in the technical community, often involves high-dimensional, time consuming, and computationally intensive simulations. Because of the computational cost, these tools are often used to evaluate specific conditions and rarely used for statistical analysis. The challenge is to capture what is learned from a limited number of LS-DYNA simulations to develop models that allow users to conduct interpolation of solutions {{at a fraction of the}} computational time. For this problem, response surface models are used to predict the system time responses to a water landing as a function of <b>capsule</b> <b>speed,</b> direction, attitude, water speed, and water direction. Furthermore, these models can also be used to ascertain the adequacy of the design in terms of probability measures. This paper presents a description of the LS-DYNA model, a brief summary of the response surface techniques, the analysis of variance approach used in the sensitivity studies, equations used to estimate impact parameters, results showing conditions that might cause injuries, and concluding remarks...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Springer Verlag via the DOI in this record. This paper studies {{the dynamics of the}} vibro-impact capsule systems with one-sided and two-sided soft constraints under variations of various system and control parameters, including mass ratio, stiffness ratio, gap of contact, and amplitude and frequency of external excitation. The aim {{of this study is to}} optimise the progression speed and energy consumption of the capsule, and minimize the required cabin length for prototype design used for engineering pipeline inspection. Our studies focus on three systems: the capsule with a right constraint, the capsule with a right and a weak left constraints, and the capsule with a right and a strong left constraints. Bifurcation analyses show that the behaviour of the capsule with one-sided constraint is mainly periodic, and the dynamic responses of the other two capsules with two-sided constraints become complex when the stiffness of the left constraint increases. Based on our extensive comparisons, the following optimisation strategies are recommended. When the <b>capsule</b> <b>speed</b> is paramount, one can employ the two-sided capsule with a weak left constraint under large amplitude of excitation. When energy consumption is taken into account, the one-sided capsule is preferable. When a miniaturized prototype is needed, the two-sided capsule with a strong left constraint is the best choice.

NZBC increased total running distance by 10. 6 % (NZBC: 4282 ± 833 m, placebo: 3871 ± 622 m, P= 0. 02), with the distance during sprints increased by 10. 8 % (P= 0. 02). Heart rate, oxygen uptake, lactate and rating of perceived exertion were not different between conditions for the first 4 stages completed by all subjects. At exhaustion, blood lactate tended to be higher for NZBC (NZBC: 6. 01 ± 1. 07 mmol∙L- 1, placebo: 5. 22 ± 1. 52 mmol∙L- 1, P= 0. 07).

30|$|The second {{generation}} CCE developed by [3] is about 11 × 31 mm and takes 14 frames/min {{until the first}} frame of the small bowel then captures frames at adaptive frame rate of 4 – 35 frames per second depending on the <b>speed</b> of the <b>capsule.</b> Although, adaptive frame rate improves the visualization, the video appears jagged; sample videos {{can be obtained from}} [4]. The images are at a lower resolution compared to traditional colonoscopy (usually full-HD). The images produced by capsule video endoscopy suffer from several problems, such as uneven and low illumination, low resolution, high compression ratio, and noise. The problem of capsule image enhancement has been an active research topic over the past decade [5, 6], but there are few publications that consider the low temporal frame rate aspect of capsule videos. Frame interpolation is a technique of creating intermediate frames based on overlapping neighboring frames in sequence. The CCE video reader softwares such as RapidReader [4] support viewing from 2 – 40 frames per second with an option to pause, rewind, and play the video. Watching the video at two frames per second is the most robust way to find pathologies, but the videos are not smooth for watching and hence takes more time to view. It {{is important to note that}} frame interpolation does not increase the duration of CCE videos rather makes the video more smooth and natural to view. CCE frame interpolation should in general consider the following three conditions: Firstly, the interpolated frame should not contain motion and image artifacts that could lead to wrong diagnosis. Secondly, flickering and blurring of frames should be avoided when displaying image sequences. Thirdly, the interpolated frames need to compensate apparent motion of camera and give a natural motion portrayal. Karargyris et al. [7] proposed three-dimensional reconstruction of the digestive wall in capsule endoscopy videos using elastic video interpolation. In their work, they propose a methodology that creates the intermediate (interpolated) frames between two CCE frames followed by three-dimensional reconstruction, given that these two frames carry mutual information of some degree. The interpolation is done by computing optical flow from the region-based matching technique. The segmentation of the video frames is performed by the fuzzy region growing segmentation followed by matching of the segments in consecutive frames based on color, texture, and geometry information. Similar work was presented in [8] where the authors presented frame interpolation as a post-processing technique at the receiver for saving battery power at the transmitter. This is done by transmitting frames at a lower frame rate, given it can be reconstructed by using neighboring frames at the receiver, hence saving power at the transmitter. In their work, they used unidirectional and bidirectional block-matching motion estimation and compensation method to create the intermediate frames.|$|R
40|$|High temperature, shear and {{pressure}} during extrusion {{can cause a}} considerable loss of flavour volatiles added in the feed material due to thermal degradation, oxidation, polymerisation or flash distillation. Encapsulating the flavour before extrusion is a promising approach to improve the flavour volatiles retention during extrusion. β-Cyclodextrin, a truncated cone shaped molecule containing seven glucopyranose units, can provide an excellent protection of flavour through molecular inclusion encapsulation, as the flavour volatile molecules are held inside the hydrophobic cavity of β-cyclodextrin, allowing their high retention. Another encapsulation technique, protein precipitation, is a potential alternative, as β-cyclodextrin is not permitted for food application in some countries. In this technique, flavour is encapsulated in a water insoluble protein based system, providing the flavour with protection against severe damage during extrusion. The capsules incorporated into the feed prior to extrusion also receive the same mixing, heating and shearing {{as the rest of}} the feed material during the extrusion process, and their presence may influence the rheological properties of the melt and in turn affect the extrudate properties. Extrusion conditions such as temperature and screw speed can also significantly affect the product quality parameters such as expansion, apparent density, and hardness, as well as affecting the development, retention, and degradation of flavour components. The interaction among those input variables, together with the presence of the capsules in the feed materials can affect the final product properties. The objective of this work was to determine the stability of a model flavour volatile d-limonene encapsulated in both β-cyclodextrin and sodium caseinate capsule when exposed to extrusion conditions, and to determine whether the presence of the capsules and d-limonene affects extruder operation or product characteristics. Two sets of extrusion experiments were carried out in Prism Eurolab KX 16 twin screw extruder (16 mm diameter screw; 40 : 1 L/D ratio) using corn starch as a food matrix. In one set of experiments, d-limonene was encapsulated in β-cyclodextrin. In the other set of experiments, d-limonene was encapsulated with sodium caseinate. Using a Surface Response Methodology, Central Composite Uniform Precision Design, three variables were studied: level of encapsulated ingredient in the feed material (0, 0. 01, 2. 5, 3. 99 and 5 %); extruder screw speeds (β-cyclodextrin, 158, 175, 200, 225 and 242 rpm; sodium caseinate, 145, 151, 160, 169 and 175 rpm) and maximum barrel temperatures (β-cyclodextrin, 133, 140, 150, 160 and 167 °C; sodium caseinate, 125, 129, 135, 141 and 145 °C). Another set of experiment with unencapsulated d-limonene was also performed as a comparison experiment at five levels of d-limonene addition (0. 00, 0. 07, 0. 25, 0. 43 and 0. 50 %), maximum barrel temperatures (125, 128, 135, 142, 145 °C) and a screw speed of 160 rpm. In addition, a set of in-line rheometer experiments was carried out to determine the viscosity behaviour of the starch mixture melt as influenced by feed compositions (2. 5 and 5 % of both capsules addition and 0. 25 and 5 % of unencapsulated d-limonene addition) at a maximum barrel temperature of 139 °C and screw speed of 167 rpm. Measured parameters included extruder operation responses (torque, die pressure, specific mechanical energy [SME], residence time distribution [RTD]), flavour retention and product characteristics (expansion ratio, density, hardness, water absorption index [WAI], water solubility index [WSI] and colour). Extruder operation gave different responses with the variation in feed formulation and extrusion condition. In general, torque and die pressure decreased with the increase in barrel temperature and screw speeds. The presence of capsules modified extruder responses and behaved differently with the type of additives. Incorporating β-cyclodextrin capsules into the feed materials gave a maxima response surface of die pressure, while sodium caseinate capsules exhibited the opposite trend. Minima trends in torque were observed with the addition of sodium caseinate capsule and unencapsulated d-limonene. Barrel temperature, screw <b>speed</b> and <b>capsule</b> level had significant effects on flavour retention and product properties. β-Cyclodextrin capsules gave higher flavour retention (average across 0. 01 to 5 % levels of addition: 92. 2 %) than the sodium caseinate capsules (67. 5 %). Without encapsulation, the flavour retention was very low (average of 8. 0 %). The retention increased with the increase in capsule level, reached a maximum value at capsule levels of 4. 5 % and 3. 0 % for β-cyclodextrin and sodium caseinate capsules, respectively, and then decreased with further increase in capsule level. Without encapsulation, the retention of d-limonene steadily increased with the increase in the level of d-limonene addition. addition. viii A higher radial expansion ratio was observed from the extrudates containing sodium caseinate capsules than those with β-cyclodextrin (average of 1. 87 and 1. 38, respectively). The expansion ratio responded in the opposite way to flavour retention to increasing levels of encapsulated ingredient addition. The expansion ratio decreased as the capsule level rose to 2. 5 %, and then went up with the increasing in capsule level from 2. 5 % to 5 % for the sodium caseinate capsules. The expansion ratio of extrudate containing β-cyclodextrin continuously decreased with the increase in capsule level. Extrudates containing unencapsulated d-limonene had the highest expansion ratio (average of 2. 1). The presence of capsules enhanced extrudate hardness. β-Cyclodextrin capsules gave the lowest extrudate hardness (average of 1. 14 N/mm 2), followed by sodium caseinate capsules (average of 2. 34 N/mm 2) and unencapsulated d-limonene (average of 3. 38 N/mm 2). These showed that the presence of capsules modified the properties of the extrudates. The presence of capsules, together with the changes in barrel temperatures and screw speeds apparently modified the melt viscosity behaviour possibly through the interaction of starch and capsules, interaction of starch and d-limonene, and lubricating effect of d-limonene released from the capsules to the melt. Power Law models obtained from in-line rheology experiments were applied to predict the viscosity behaviour of the melt with the presence of capsules and unencapsulated d-limonene. It was predicted that an incorporation of 2. 5 % of sodium caseinate capsules tended to decrease the viscosity, while further increase to 5 % resulted in an increase in viscosity. A similar trend of viscosity was also observed in the presence of unencapsulated d-limonene. These results were in agreement with the extruder operation responses and extrudate properties in the presence of sodium caseinate capsules or unencapsulated d-limonene. The presence of β-cyclodextrin capsules tended to decrease the viscosity of the melt, which was not in line with the extruder operation responses and extrudate properties, presumably due to the poor predictability of Power Law model in the case of a mixture containing the β-cyclodextrin capsules. This study enhanced the knowledge in the area of flavour encapsulation for extrusion application. It provided the trends in extruder operation responses, flavour retention and extrudate properties with the changes in capsule type and extrusion conditions. This will allow further development of encapsulation technique and extrusion process to obtain optimum conditions for high flavour retention and desired extrudate properties...|$|R
