5000|$|Surface {{mining and}} in-situ {{processing}} requires extensive land use. Mining, processing and waste disposal require land {{to be withdrawn}} from traditional uses, and therefore should avoid high density population areas. Oil shale mining reduces the original ecosystem diversity with habitats supporting a variety of plants and animals. After mining the land has to be reclaimed. However, this process takes time and cannot necessarily re-establish the original biodiversity. [...] The impact of sub-surface mining on the surroundings will be less than for open pit mines. However, sub-surface mining may also cause subsidence of the surface due {{to the collapse of}} mined-out area and abandoned <b>stone</b> <b>drifts.</b>|$|E
5000|$|November 19, 2010: Pike River Mine {{disaster}} in New Zealand. At 3:45pm, the coal mine exploded. Twenty-nine men underground died immediately, or shortly afterwards, from the blast {{or from the}} toxic atmosphere. Two men in the <b>stone</b> <b>drift,</b> {{some distance from the}} mine workings, managed to escape. (Extract from Royal Commission of Enquiry Report on Pike River.) ...|$|R
5000|$|To {{improve the}} {{ventilation}} {{and deal with}} the gas issue it was resolved to drive a <b>stone</b> <b>drift</b> from near the pit bottom towards the more remote workings. Because this was passing through rock and not coal there was thought to be little risk of firedamp, and therefore it was being blasted though for [...] "all speed". It was hoped that the final stone would be blasted out that day linking the new drift to an existing passage.|$|R

Minto had previously been an under-viewer at the Oaks and could brief Jeffcock on the colliery and the steps taken so far. Jeffcock descended meeting Brown, Potter, Cooper and Platts coming off shift. At 01:30 {{most of the men}} below ground came up and Minto with Mr Smith (the mining engineer from Lundhill Colliery)went below.

40|$|At present, {{many high}} gas and {{outburst}} mines have poor gas drainage effects. An important reason influencing the gas drainage {{effect is a}} poor hole-sealing effect. Most studies on gas drainage borehole sealing focus on local and foreign borehole sealing methods, borehole sealing equipment, and borehole sealing materials. Numerical simulations of initial drilling sealing depth are insufficient because studies on this subject are few. However, when the initial sealing depth of the borehole is not chosen reasonably, air can enter the gas drainage drill hole through the circumferential crack of roadway surrounding rocks {{under the influence of}} suction pressure of the drainage system. This phenomenon ultimately affects the hole-sealing effect. To improve the drilling hole sealing of gas drainage boring, we deduced the expression formulas of the crushing zone, plastic zone, and elastic zone around the coal-seam floor <b>stone</b> <b>drift</b> and conducted a stress–strain analysis of the coal-seam floor <b>stone</b> <b>drift</b> of the 2145 working surfaces of the Sixth Coal Mine of Hebi Coal Mine Group Company by using theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and on-scene verification. Finally, we obtain the initial drilling sealing depth, which is a main contribution of this study. The results prove the following. The performed hole-sealing process with an initial drilling sealing depth of 8 m has a gas drainage efficiency of 55...|$|R
40|$|Key words: {{directional}} blasting; slit-charge; drifting; orthogonal {{experimental design}} method Abstract. Slit-charge for directional fracture controlled blasting technology has demonstrated the clear superiority in <b>stone</b> <b>drifting</b> in coal mines. However, the slit-charge {{has not yet been}} molded products, which limited its application to further promotion. Structural parameter optimization for slit-charge using orthogonal {{experimental design method}} was carried out. The slit-charge blasting in Lead column performed, the slit-charge blasting primary and secondary influencing factors were obtained by using range analysis; Range analysis methods were applied to analyze the sensitivity of these factors and coupling influences. Structural parameters of slit-charge were determined according to effect curves. This product is easy to use and significant effect in the field. All of half blast-hole trace ratios are more than 90 %, the driving speed could be highly increased．Contour shape of roadway is in good condition to avoid rockfalls and rockslides. Overbreak can be costly. Theoretical results are translated into technology, and technological achievements into products...|$|R
5000|$|Two {{secondary}} explosions {{were generated}} by the first, and killed more miners and ponies before dissipating. In total, 20 miners {{were killed in the}} three explosions showing signs of burning, with a further 4 killed by the force of the explosion. Of the 81 men in the pit who survived the explosions, only 42 managed to reach the surface alive, as many miners were trapped by roof falls and succumbed to after-damp poisoning. Rescuers retrieving the bodies described how the miners’ footprints in the dust could be traced showing the roads they had travelled along in an endeavour to escape before they were overwhelmed. [...] All 11 miners who were in the Black Bed seam escaped. However, they heard and felt the force of the explosion in the Beeston Bed and were knocked off their feet or struck by trap doors. They were very quickly rendered unconscious for an hour by after-damp, and upon waking, the Deputy, Robert Henry Nevins, was asked by the young teenage miners to pray for them. With the cages out of operation, they had to scramble up a <b>stone</b> <b>drift</b> to reach the Beeston Bed and were overcome by afterdamp again, 600 yards from shaft. Barely able to walk, they were forced to leave behind one of their party, Fred Atkinson, and upon reaching the No.2 shaft, another party of survivors gathered there witnessed them being violently ill and in distress. The sick and injured were the first to be sent up to the surface two hours later once repairs had been made to the cage.|$|R

40|$|Diel {{changes in}} the numbers and {{activity}} of mayfly (Ephemeroptera) nymphs on the substrate surface in a stony-bottom stream were determined by direct observations, to investigate the relationship between benthic activity and drift. Individuals were viewed through a glass box (0. 1 m 2 area) at 2 -h intervals for 24 h; dim red light was used during darkness. Baetis was relatively unaffected {{by the presence of}} the observer, whereas Cinygmula was very easily disturbed. The number of individuals in view, activity per individual, and total activity all were greatest by day and least during the night for both species. Each of these measures was significantly correlated with temperature, which varied 6 ”- 8 °C over the diel cycle. Drift activity, in contrast, was strongly nocturnal and generally peaked immediately after nightfall. Because of the clear lack of correspondence between drift and the activity of mayfly nymphs on <b>stone</b> tops, behavioral <b>drift</b> in this system cannot be explained as the passive consequence of foraging. The downstream transport of organisms in rivers, termed drift, {{has been the subject of}} many studies (e. g. Waters 1969, 1972...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{propeller}} fans in underground <b>drift</b> <b>stone</b> mines {{has shown}} that significant ventilation improvements can be achieved. In large-entry mines {{that do not have}} any high resistance-sections (shafts> 100 ft long or shaft diameters < 12 ft), propeller fans can greatly increase the total system airflow. Propeller fans can be used as either main mine fans or as freestanding auxiliary (jet) fans. NIOSH researchers have documented the performance of two recently installed propeller fans in a working limestone mine (figure 1). Together the fans exhausted 750, 000 cfm at a rated hp of 200. These fans replaced an axial vane main mine fan that produced 300, 000 cfm at a rated hp of 250. The use of the propeller fans more than doubled the air quantity while operating at 50 hp less than the original main mine fan system. In addition, the new fans, when used with effective air-coursing methods such as stoppings, reduced or eliminated recirculation near the face areas. This is because propeller fans are more efficient at lower pressures and can produce large air quantities at lower horsepower requirements than axial vane fans.

60|$|Many {{analogous}} facts {{could be}} given: {{indeed it is}} an almost universal rule that the endemic productions of islands are related {{to those of the}} nearest continent, or of other near islands. The exceptions are few, and most of them can be explained. Thus the plants of Kerguelen Land, though standing nearer to Africa than to America, are related, and that very closely, as we know from Dr. Hooker's account, to those of America: but on the view that this island has been mainly stocked by seeds brought with earth and <b>stones</b> on icebergs, <b>drifted</b> by the prevailing currents, this anomaly disappears. New Zealand in its endemic plants is much more closely related to Australia, the nearest mainland, than to any other region: and this is what might have been expected; but it is also plainly related to South America, which, although the next nearest continent, is so enormously remote, that the fact becomes an anomaly. But this difficulty almost disappears on the view that both New Zealand, South America, and other southern lands were long ago partially stocked from a nearly intermediate though distant point, namely from the antarctic islands, when they were clothed with vegetation, before the commencement of the Glacial period. The affinity, which, though feeble, I am assured by Dr. Hooker is real, between the flora of the south-western corner of Australia and of the Cape of Good Hope, is a far more remarkable case, and is at present inexplicable: but this affinity is confined to the plants, and will, I do not doubt, be some day explained.|$|R
40|$|Technological complexity, {{including}} the use of projectile weaponry, is an important attribute of modern human behavior. The transition from the hand-held hand axe to smaller hafted tools may have happened as early as 285 ka, but the unequivocal use of the bow and arrow is undocumented before the Later Stone Age. ^ This investigation contributes to the understanding of Middle Stone Age (MSA) behavior from a technological perspective and directly addresses behavioral complexity as part of the adaptive package of Homo sapiens in the MSA of East Africa. The work investigated the technology and functions of points found at the MSA Cartwright 2 ̆ 7 s site, Kenya. The description of the MSA assemblage at the site has been carried out to find out its character and how it compares to other MSA sites in the surrounding Central Rift Valley sites of Prospect Farm and Prolonged <b>Drift.</b> <b>Stone</b> points occur at all three MSA sites that have been examined in this study, but they may have been used to arm short stabbing spears (assegais), long throwing spears (javelins), or arrows. To clarify this issue, the points 2 ̆ 7 aerodynamic properties and traces of damage and use-wear were examined and compared with those documented in experimental studies to determine what weaponry systems they were part of. Replicated points were used with the bow and arrow to test the proposition that some MSA points were used to arm bows and arrows. The findings from this experimental study suggest that some MSA points were used with the bow and arrow and are effective weapons in terms of distance, accuracy and penetration, and may have served to increase the hunting success of MSA hominids. ^ The study also provides useful insights into the technological variability found among assemblages. Results from comparative analyses of artifacts from Cartwright 2 ̆ 7 s site, Prolonged Drift and Prospect Farm show that Cartwright 2 ̆ 7 s site largely conforms to MSA patterns that include plasticity in manufacture techniques and variation in assemblage composition among other parameters. ...|$|R
