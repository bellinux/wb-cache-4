25|$|<b>Sciurus</b> <b>carolinensis,</b> {{common name}} eastern gray {{squirrel}} or grey squirrel depending on region, is a tree squirrel in the genus Sciurus. It {{is native to}} eastern North America, where {{it is the most}} prodigious and ecologically essential natural forest regenerator. The eastern grey squirrel in Europe is regarded as an invasive species.|$|E
25|$|Eastern gray {{squirrel}} (<b>Sciurus</b> <b>carolinensis)</b> — {{the most frequently}} seen mammal in Connecticut and the largest squirrel found in the state. Acorn production can fluctuate greatly from year to year, affecting the squirrel population. Historically, {{there have been reports}} of large migrations of squirrels, including one in 1933 involving at least 1,000 {{gray squirrel}}s swimming across the Connecticut River between Hartford and Essex. Limited food supply probably causes these migrations, although the exact causes are unknown. In Stratford, white squirrels, a local variant of the species, had been seen for years as of 2010 in different sections of town. Many had some light gray or reddish color and black eyes, indicating they were not albinos.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sciurus</b> <b>carolinensis</b> is {{native to}} the eastern and midwestern United States, and to the southerly {{portions}} of the eastern provinces of Canada. The native range of the eastern gray squirrel overlaps {{with that of the}} fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), with which it is sometimes confused, although the core of the fox squirrel's range is slightly more to the west. The eastern gray squirrel is found from New Brunswick to Manitoba, south to East Texas and Florida. Breeding eastern gray squirrels are found in Nova Scotia, but whether this population was introduced or came from natural range expansion is not known. It has also been introduced into Ireland, Britain, Italy, South Africa, and Australia (where it was extirpated by 1973). Eastern grey squirrels in Europe are a concern because they have displaced some of the native squirrels there.|$|E
500|$|Cott, like Thayer, {{argued that}} countershading would make animals {{hard to see}} from the side, as they would [...] "fade into a ghostly elusiveness". Rowland notes that Cott is here {{reviewing}} Thayer's theory and [...] "reinforcing the view that a gradation in shading would act to eliminate the effects of ventral shadowing." [...] Kiltie measured {{the effect of the}} countershading of the grey squirrel, <b>Sciurus</b> <b>carolinensis,</b> showing that when the squirrel is horizontal the self-shadowing of the belly is partly concealed, but that when the squirrel is vertical (as when climbing a tree trunk) this effect did not occur.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} claimed that [...] "Squirrels {{are the only}} known albino mammal to survive {{successfully}} in the wild". In all albino mammals studied, the eye color is green, blue or red due to absence of eumelanin in the iris, and {{the centre of the}} retina is under-developed with a deficit of rod cells; the central ganglion cell density is approximately 25% below normal. [...] In nearly all mammals, the overwhelming majority of photoreceptors are rods rather than cones. Albinism specifically affects the rod cells, but the number and distribution of the cones is unaffected. [...] The retina of the squirrel (<b>Sciurus</b> <b>carolinensis)</b> is unusual for mammals as it is rich in cones. [...] Central cell densities are less than 5% lower in albino squirrels than in pigmented individuals. [...] This relatively minor disruption to vision is thought to assist in the survivability of albino squirrels in the wild. [...] This is supported by observations that the behaviour of albinos in the wild, e.g. leaping from branch to branch, is similar to pigmented squirrels.|$|E
2500|$|Europe's Grey {{squirrels}} (<b>Sciurus</b> <b>carolinensis),</b> {{originated in}} North America, {{where they are}} known as eastern gray squirrels (to differentiate from western gray squirrels). They eat large seeds, flowers, buds, fruits, fungi, some insects, and occasionally bird eggs.

They were first introduced into England, in a concerted way, in 1876 ...|$|E

60|$|Owing to the {{generally}} large {{size of this}} class of animals, and the comparatively small number of naturalists who study them, large series of specimens are only occasionally examined and compared, and thus the materials for determining the question of their variability {{in a state of}} nature are comparatively scanty. The fact that our domestic animals belonging to this group, especially dogs, present extreme varieties not surpassed even by pigeons and poultry among birds, renders it almost certain that an equal amount of variability exists in the wild state; and this is confirmed by the example of a species of squirrel (<b>Sciurus</b> <b>carolinensis),</b> of which sixteen specimens, all males and all taken in Florida, were measured and tabulated by Mr. Allen. The diagram here given shows, that, both the general amount of the variation and the independent variability of the several members of the body, accord completely with the variations so common in the class of birds; while their amount and their independence of each other are even greater than usual.|$|E

50|$|The town is {{noteworthy}} for {{an abundance of}} pure white squirrels. Although most scientists consider these animals leucistic eastern gray squirrels, Professor Jean Engohang-Ndong and a research team from the biology department of Kent State University believe they are a separate subspecies of gray squirrels. They have proposed the name of <b>Sciurus</b> <b>carolinensis</b> bainbridgus for the animals.|$|E
5000|$|Although these {{squirrels}} {{are commonly}} referred to as [...] "albinos", most of them are likely non-albino squirrels that exhibit a rare white fur coloration known as leucism that is {{as a result of a}} recessive gene found within certain Eastern gray squirrel (<b>Sciurus</b> <b>carolinensis)</b> populations, and so technically they ought to be referred to as white squirrels, instead of albino.|$|E
50|$|Many {{species have}} been {{introduced}} to Britain during historical times. Some species such as the midwife toad (Alytes), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) and horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) have been introduced with no adverse consequences. However, others such as the eastern grey squirrel (<b>Sciurus</b> <b>carolinensis),</b> signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus), and Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica) have had a severe impact both economically and ecologically.|$|E
50|$|The Eastern Great Lakes lowland {{forests are}} very rich in wildlife. Birds include cardinals, downy woodpecker, wood duck and eastern screech owl. Large mammals {{including}} American black bear (Ursus americanus), moose (Alces alces), and gray wolf (Canis lupus) {{have been removed}} from this ecoregion and remaining mammals include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), coyote (Canis latrans), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus), American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and eastern gray squirrel (<b>Sciurus</b> <b>carolinensis).</b>|$|E
50|$|The red {{squirrel}} (Sciurus vulgaris) survived in the Forest until the 1970s - {{longer than most}} places in lowland Britain (though it still occurs on The Isle of Wight and the nearby Brownsea Island). It is now fully supplanted in the Forest by the introduced North American grey squirrel (<b>Sciurus</b> <b>carolinensis).</b> The European polecat (Mustela putorius) has recolonised {{the western edge of}} the Forest in recent years. European otter (Lutra lutra) occurs along watercourses, as well as the introduced American mink (Neovison vison).|$|E
50|$|The park {{is notable}} for the {{presence}} {{of a large number of}} melanistic (black) Eastern Gray Squirrels (<b>Sciurus</b> <b>carolinensis),</b> and because of this, the recreational sport of squirrel fishing has developed in the area. However the squirrel population is not indigenous; they were first introduced to the park in 1914, when four pairs of squirrels were purchased. In February 1961 a group of squirrels were taken to Kent State University, in Ohio, United States, where they have become firmly established.|$|E
50|$|Rally Squirrel is {{the name}} given to an American gray {{squirrel}} (<b>Sciurus</b> <b>carolinensis)</b> which appeared {{on the field and}} ran across home plate at Busch Stadium during a 2011 National League Division Series (NLDS) Major League Baseball game between the Philadelphia Phillies and St. Louis Cardinals on October 5, 2011. The squirrel captured American media attention, and was adopted as an unofficial mascot by the Cardinals and the populace of St. Louis. The Cardinals would go on to win the 2011 World Series in dramatic fashion.|$|E
50|$|Grey {{squirrels}} (<b>Sciurus</b> <b>carolinensis)</b> {{alter their}} behaviour {{according to the}} relative costs and benefits when foraging in the open. Small food items are consumed immediately to maximise energy intake, as they require little handling time so the cost of predation risk is low. Large items that require a long handling time, and hence time exposed to predators, are carried back {{to the safety of}} a tree to minimise predation risk. Although there is an energetic cost to transporting food, large food items have a high contribution to nutrient intake so the cost outweighs the benefits.|$|E
5000|$|Distance to refuge: Gray {{squirrels}} (<b>Sciurus</b> <b>carolinensis)</b> typically run to {{the nearest}} tree to escape from predators. As the risk of capture increases with distance from the refuge tree, squirrels feeding far from trees should have greater FID than those feeding closer by. Confirming this, FID {{in response to a}} motorized model predator (a cat) increased as distance to refuge increased. [...] Burrowing Owls breeding in territories far from roads showed larger FIDs than individuals breeding closer to roads and mated owls showed similar FIDs. Individual owls showed high repeatability in their FID.|$|E
50|$|Other {{small mammals}} that {{commonly}} are {{found on the}} refuge include eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus), American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), and eastern grey squirrel (<b>Sciurus</b> <b>carolinensis).</b> These species are most common in pine-oak forests where acorns are abundant. Southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) is recorded for the Upper Wells and Brave Boat divisions, but they probably also occur in other areas with mature pine-oak forest. Other small mammals that are known or are likely to occur on the refuge include hairy-tailed mole (Parascalops breweri), star-nosed mole (Condylura cristata), smoky shrew (Sorex fumeus), and house mouse (Mus musculus).|$|E
50|$|The North American {{porcupine}} {{has a long}} {{gestation period}} relative to other rodents. The female's pregnancy lasts for 202 days. By contrast, the North American beaver, which is comparable in size, has a gestation period of 128 days. The eastern grey squirrel (<b>Sciurus</b> <b>carolinensis)</b> has a gestation period of just 44 days. Porcupines {{give birth to a}} single young. At birth, they weigh about 450 g, which increases to nearly 1 kg after the first two weeks. They do not gain full adult weight {{until the end of the}} second summer about 4.5 kg. Their quills harden soon after birth.|$|E

The native squirrel in Europe is the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris). Both species have similar diets, use similar locations of the environment, and have similar activity patterns; however, {{there is no evidence of}} noticeable aggression between the two species. These Eastern grey squirrels are considered an invasive species in Europe because of their presence contributing to the displacement of the red squirrels.|$|E
