5|$|In 2002 and 2003, NATO {{conducted}} a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> {{with the intention}} of standardizing a PDW cartridge as a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. The tests compared the relative merits of the 5.7×28mm cartridge and the 4.6×30mm cartridge, which was created by Heckler & Koch as a competitor to the 5.7×28mm. The NATO group subsequently recommended the 5.7×28mm cartridge, citing superior performance in testing, but the German delegation objected and the standardization process was indefinitely halted.|$|E

50|$|Less {{than three}} months after Bono's death, the first launch vehicle based on his designs, the McDonnell Douglas DC-X (Delta Clipper) began a largely {{successful}} <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> flights. The DC-X was a vertical-takeoff and vertical landing vehicle. The <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> flights began on 18 August 1993 and continued until the upgraded version of the launch vehicle (renamed the DC-XA) tipped over on landing on July 31, 1996.|$|R

5|$|One current {{difficulty}} in {{the ideas of}} Geniocracy is that the means of assessing intelligence are ill-defined. One idea offered by Rael in Geniocracy is to have specialists such as psychologists, neurologists, ethnologists, etc., perfect or choose among existing ones, a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> that would define each person's level of intelligence. They should be designed to measure intellectual potential rather than accumulation of knowledge.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} {{implants}} has {{to account for}} a lifetime of real-world use in a person's mouth. Regulators and the dental implant industry have created a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> to determine the long-term mechanical reliability of implants in a person's mouth where the implant is struck repeatedly with increasing forces (similar in magnitude to biting) until it fails.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission was}} also {{scheduled}} {{to carry out}} a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> with the TDRS-1 satellite which had been deployed by STS-6, to ensure the system was fully operational before it was used to support the Spacelab 1 program on the upcoming STS-9 flight. The orbiter furthermore carried equipment to allow for encrypted transmissions, to be tested for use in future classified missions.|$|E

5|$|A {{laboratory}} test showed how males of P. fimbriata from Queensland minimise {{the risk of}} meeting each other, by recognising fresh pieces of blotting paper, some containing their own silk draglines and some containing another male's draglines. Males also were attracted by fresh blotting paper containing females' draglines, while females {{do not respond to}} fresh blotting paper containing males' draglines. This suggested that the males usually search for females, rather than vice versa. Neither sex responded to one week-old blotting paper, irrespective of whether it contained males' or females' draglines. A similar <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> showed that P. labiata showed the same patterns of responses between the sexes.|$|E
5|$|Dyslexia is {{believed}} to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Some cases run in families. It often occurs in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with similar difficulties with numbers. It may begin in adulthood {{as the result of a}} traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia. The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia are problems within the brain's language processing. Dyslexia is diagnosed through a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> of memory, spelling, vision, and reading skills. Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision problems or by insufficient teaching.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Bell Labs {{formulated}} {{their own}} set of requirements for radar work in relation to Nike-X. Working with the Army, Air Force, Lincoln Labs and ARPA, the Nike-X Reentry Measurements Program (RMP) ran {{a long series of}} reentry measurements with the Project PRESS radars, especially TRADEX. Additionally, a Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star aircraft was refit with optical and infrared telescopes for optical tracking tests. The first <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests,</b> RMP-A, focused on modern conical reentry vehicles. It concluded on 30 June 1966. These demonstrated that these vehicles were difficult to discriminate because of their low drag. RMP-B ran between 1967 and 1970, supported by 17 launches from Vandenberg, {{with a wide variety of}} vehicle shapes and penetration aids.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to developing a}} suitable barrier, the SAM Laboratories also had {{to assist in the}} design of a gaseous separation plant, which became known as K-25. Libby helped with the engineers from Kellex to produce a workable design for a pilot plant. Libby conducted a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> that indicated that the Norris-Adler barrier would work, and he remained confident that with an all-out effort, the remaining problems with it could be solved. Although doubts remained, construction work began on the K-25 full-scale production plant in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|The Avatar completes a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> at Scintillus Academy, a mage school whose {{staff was}} killed by the Guardian. Afterwards, the player travels to the Pits of Carnage, a {{subterranean}} prison on {{a world where the}} Guardian trains soldiers to attack other dimensions; and to the Tomb of Praecor Loth, where a king killed in a war with the Guardian is buried. Finally, the Avatar visits the Ethereal Void, a strange world with floating, glowing pathways and no map. Eventually, the Avatar discovers that Mayor Patterson is the traitor and destroys the blackrock dome.|$|E
5|$|The RaLa Experiment, or RaLa, was a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> {{during and}} after the Manhattan Project {{designed}} to study the behavior of converging shock waves to achieve the spherical implosion necessary for compression of the plutonium pit of the nuclear weapon. The experiment used significant amounts of a short-lived radioisotope lanthanum-140, a potent source of gamma radiation; the RaLa is a contraction of Radioactive Lanthanum. The method was proposed by Robert Serber and developed by a team led by the Italian experimental physicist Bruno Rossi.|$|E

5|$|The {{selection}} process differs by country, but it often {{consists of a}} <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> which admit fewer students at each progressing test. Awards are given to approximately the top-scoring 50% of the individual contestants. Teams are not officially recognizedall scores are given only to individual contestants, but team scoring is unofficially compared more than individual scores. Contestants must be {{under the age of}} 20 and must not be registered at any tertiary institution. Subject to these conditions, an individual may participate any number of times in the IMO.|$|E
5|$|A <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> {{conducted}} by the PSB Corporation and SGS Testing & Control Services found the spring water contains 420mg of chloride per litre, an amount which is substantially higher than the 35 to 100mg in the water from Choa Chu Kang and Bedok waterworks. It was {{also found that the}} sulphide content is three times more than tap water and the spring water is also slightly alkaline due to the presence of minerals. Natural spring waters may have health benefits, similar to the hot springs of other countries near tectonic plates with volcanoes, in a search for cures for some skin conditions, as well as debilitating ailments like rheumatism and arthritis. Although local rheumatologists conceded that hydrotherapy is an accepted treatment that can be helpful for mild forms of rheumatism or muscle strain, they, along with dermatologists, remain skeptical of claims about the alternative healing of the natural spring water.|$|E
5|$|After Sim Snuka, {{the son of}} Jimmy Snuka, also {{expressed}} interest in joining the group, Orton made them qualify through a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> which Manu failed the first week. On the January 5 episode of Raw, Snuka and Rhodes won a tag team match against Cryme Tyme. Before the match, Orton informed them {{that they had to}} win the match in order {{to be part of the}} group. After the match, Orton explained that since Snuka did not pick up the pinfall, he was out of the group. The following week, Manu and Snuka informed Rhodes that they were intending to assault Orton and had brought someone to help them do so, giving Rhodes an ultimatum to choose a side. When Rhodes refused to side with them, Manu and Snuka brought out a returning Ted DiBiase to aid them, and tried to assault Rhodes and Orton. Instead DiBiase joined The Legacy, attacking Manu and Snuka, and forgiving Orton for attacking him.|$|E

5|$|As at Oak Ridge, {{the most}} {{difficulty}} was encountered while canning the uranium slugs, which commenced at Hanford in March 1944. They were pickled to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and aluminum-silicon alloy, canned using hydraulic presses, and then capped using arc welding under an argon atmosphere. Finally, they {{were subjected to}} a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> to detect holes or faulty welds. Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output {{of only a handful}} of canned slugs per day. But steady progress was made and by June 1944 production increased to the point where it appeared that enough canned slugs would be available to start Reactor B on schedule in August 1944.|$|E
5|$|Falk, Heine, Takemura, Zhang and Hsu {{investigated}} {{the validity of}} implicit self-esteem measures to assess cultural differences. They subjected Canadian and Japanese participants to a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests,</b> {{one of which was}} rating the numbers to 40 by how much participants liked them. Because the researchers saw little to no correlation between the various implicit self-esteem measures, they did not draw any conclusions about cultural differences. Stieger and Krizan explored cross-cultural differences in number preferences, specifically the day on which Christmas is celebrated as a contributor to number preference. They asked participants from six countries to rate numbers between 1 and 36. They found that in countries where gifts are exchanged on 24 December participants disproportionately preferred the number 24, whereas in countries that do this on 25 December participants preferred 25. They concluded that cultural influences need {{to be taken into account}} if these preferences are used to reflect individual differences.|$|E
5|$|From 1945 onwards, Britain {{conducted}} {{a number of}} studies into the properties and use of variable geometry wings. The noted British engineer and inventor Sir Barnes Wallis began exploring the concept during the Second World War and became an early pioneer and advocate for the variable geometry wing, conceiving of an aircraft consideration that lacked conventional features such as a vertical stabiliser and rudder, instead using variable geometry wings to provide primary controllability in their place. In 1946, Wallis published a paper upon this research, which was quickly hailed as being a major scientific breakthrough in the aviation industry. Wallis proceeded to advocate for the production of an aircraft, military or civil, that would take advantage of a variable geometry wing. The Ministry of Supply and Ministry of Defence arranged for a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> to demonstrate the application of the technology to projectiles, both for research purposes and a potential form of anti-aircraft defence; while Wallis worked upon this research programme, he continued to promote the concept of a manned variable geometry aircraft.|$|E
