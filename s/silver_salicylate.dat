40|$|In this work, Ag 2 CrO 4 {{nanostructures}} {{have been}} synthesized via a precipitation method using <b>silver</b> <b>salicylate,</b> [Ag(HSal) ], {{as a new}} precursor. At first, <b>silver</b> <b>salicylate</b> was prepared at room temperature through a precipitation method. So, silver nitrate and sodium salicylate were used as starting materials. Besides, the effect of silver precursor and surfactant concentration on the morphology of the products was investigated by SEM images. SEM images showed that particle-like powders with particle size of 250 – 300 nm and capsule-like nanostructures of Ag 2 CrO 4 with diameters ~ 100 nm and lengths 130 – 140 nm have been produced using AgNO 3 and [Ag(HSal) ], respectively. In several experiments to decrease the particle size of products, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was applied as surfactant. The as-synthesized products were characterized by energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TGA/DTA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} of methyl 5 -acetamido- 4, 7, 8, 9 -tetra-O-acetyl- 2 -chloro- 2, 3, 5 -trideoxy-β-D-glycero-D-galacto- 2 -nonulopyranosonate with {{primary and secondary}} alcohols {{in the presence of}} <b>silver</b> <b>salicylate</b> affords, after O-deacetylation, stereo-specifically the corresponding methyl (alkyl 5 -acetamido- 3, 5 -dideoxy-α-D-glycero-D-galacto- 2 -nonulopyranosid) onates. The preparation of methyl(neopentyl 5 -acetamido- 3, 5 -dideoxy-α-D-glycero-D-galacto- 2 -nonulopyranosid) onate in benzene solution shows that this glycosylation can be carried out in an inert solvent...|$|E

Furthermore, the {{following}} by-products were formed: methyl 5 -acetamido- 4, 7, 8, 9 -tetra-O-acetyl- 3, 5 -dideoxy- 2 -O-salicyloyl-D- glycero-D-galacto- 2 -nonulopyranosonate, methyl 5 -acetamido- 4, 7, 8, 9 -tetra-O-acetyl- 2, 6 -anhydro- 3, 5 -dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non- 2 -enopyranosonate, and an impure compound that gave, after O-deacetylation and catalytic hydrogenolysis, 6 -O-(methyl 5 -acetamido- 3, 5 -dideoxy-beta-D-glycero-D-galacto- 2 -n nonulopyranosylonate) -D-galactose. O-Deacetylation of 11 gave benzyl 2, 3, 4 -tri-O-benzyl- 6 -O-(methyl 5 -acetamido- 3, 5 -dideoxy-alpha-D-glycero-D-galacto- 2 -nonulopyranosylonate) -beta-D- galactopyranoside, which was converted into 6 -O-(methyl 5 -acetamido- 3, 5 -dideoxy-alpha-D-glycero-D-galacto- 2 -nonulopyranosylonate) -D-galactose (13) by catalytic hydrogenolysis. Saponification of 13 gave the title compound as its potassium salt...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{present a}} simple non-abrasive {{protocol}} {{in conjunction with}} the silver-staining method, enabling unobstructed visualization of well-defined microleakage patterns within the demineralized dentin-restorative interface. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Class V preparations were made with an occlusal margin on bevelled enamel and a gingival margin on dentin/cementum. After restoration with All Bond 2 /P- 50 and Scotchbond 2 /Silux, storage in water at 37 degrees C for 7 days and thermocycling 300 times between 5 degrees and 55 degrees C, the specimens were placed in silver nitrate solution. After silver fixation, demineralization and clearing in methyl <b>salicylate,</b> <b>silver</b> stain location was scored ordinally. In addition, a three dimensional portrait of leakage pathways was illustrated using photographic and computer digitization. RESULTS: The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that the extent of silver penetration before and after acid demineralization was not significantly different (P > 0. 05). This study also confirmed that microleakage is not uniform along the circumference of a restorative margin. Although the protocol is insensitive to microleakage occurring solely within enamel, the predominant concern over that occurring within dentin, in particular along the cervical restorative border, renders it a serviceable alternative for future investigation of the integrity of the marginal seal from clinically restored in vivo specimens...|$|R
