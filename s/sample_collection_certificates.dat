40|$|Model-based {{prediction}} {{is dependent on}} many choices ranging from the <b>sample</b> <b>collection</b> and prediction endpoint to the choice of algorithm and its parameters. Here we studied the effects of such choices, exemplified by predicting sensitivity (as IC 50) of cancer cell lines towards a variety of compounds. For this, we used three independent <b>sample</b> <b>collections</b> and applied several machine learning algorithms for predicting a variety of endpoints for drug response. We compared all possible models for combinations of <b>sample</b> <b>collections,</b> algorithm, drug, and labeling to an identically generated null model. The predictability of treatment effects varies among compounds, i. e. response could be predicted for some but not for all. The choice of <b>sample</b> <b>collection</b> {{plays a major role}} towards lowering the prediction error, as does sample size. However, we found that no algorithm was able to consistently outperform the other and {{there was no significant difference}} between regression and two- or three class predictors in this experimental setting. These results indicate that response-modeling projects should direct efforts mainly towards <b>sample</b> <b>collection</b> and data quality, rather than method adjustment...|$|R

40|$|A trace {{explosives}} {{detection system}} typically contains three subsystems: <b>sample</b> <b>collection,</b> preconcentration, and detection. <b>Sample</b> <b>collection</b> of trace explosives (vapor and particulate) through large volumes of airflow helps reduce sampling time while {{increasing the amount of}} dilute sample collected. Preconcentration of the collected sample before introduction into the detector improves the sensitivity of the detector because of the increase in sample concentration. By combining large-volume <b>sample</b> <b>collection</b> and preconcentration, an improvement in the detection of explosives is possible. Large-volume sampling and preconcentration is presented using a systems level approach. In addition, the engineering of large-volume sampling and preconcentration for the trace detection of explosives is explained...|$|R

40|$|A computer-controlled, {{automated}} <b>sample</b> <b>collection</b> from a 0. 5 -m lysimeter, {{designed to}} give superior temporal and spatial resolution for monitoring the movement of chemical tracers through a large undisturbed soil block, is described. The soil block, 0. 520. 520. 5 m, was monitored for saturation using eight time domain reflectometry probes. Rainfall was applied at approximately 1600 ml hm 1 using a 12212 array of 23 -gauge (0. 318 mm internal diameter) hypodermic needles. Soil leachates were collected {{at the base of}} the soil block using a machined aluminium collection plate with a 10210 grid of funnels that passed leachates to <b>sample</b> <b>collection</b> palettes. <b>Sample</b> <b>collection</b> was automated using a personal computer equipped with National Instruments LabVIEW™ software and linked to sensors for palette tracking. The automation of the lysimeter allowed <b>sample</b> <b>collection</b> and storage over a user-defined period with no human interaction. As an example of the use of the automated lysimeter, results show the distribution of phosphate within the soil. The eluted phosphate showed an initial and secondary peak, and only emerged from preferential flow channels...|$|R
5000|$|Collecting marine samples {{can range}} from very simple and {{inexpensive}} to very complicated expensive. Samples from near or on shores are readily accessible via beach combing, wading or snorkeling. <b>Sample</b> <b>collection</b> from deep water can be completed via dredging however, {{this is a very}} invasive technique which destroys the local habitat, does not allow for repeated sampling from the same location and compromises sample integrity. Corers can be used for sediment <b>sample</b> <b>collection</b> from deep locations quickly, easily and inexpensively. SCUBA diving was introduced in the 1940s however, [...] it was not widely used until it became popular in the 1970s. SCUBA diving is limited in the duration that divers can spend underwater when conducted from the surface. If prolonged dives were necessary, an underwater laboratory could be used. Aquarius is the only underwater laboratory dedicated to marine science. For <b>sample</b> <b>collection</b> from depths that cannot be achieved by SCUBA diving, submersibles may be used. <b>Sample</b> <b>collection</b> by submersibles can be extremely expensive with costs for a submersible, support ship, technicians and support staff ranging between $10,000 to $45,000 per day.|$|R
