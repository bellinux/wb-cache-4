50|$|The {{best known}} {{technique}} {{is the so-called}} Siemens process. This technique {{does not require a}} reductant such as zinc, as it grows high-purity silicon crystallites directly on the surface of (pre-existing) pure silicon <b>seed</b> <b>rods</b> by a chemical decomposition that takes place when the gaseous trichlorosilane is blown over the rod's surface at 1150 °C. A common name for this type of technique is chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and produces high-purity polycrystalline silicon, also known as polysilicon. While the conventional Siemens process produces electronic grade polysilicon at typically 9N-11N purities, that is, it contains impurity levels of less than one part per billion (ppb), the modified Siemens process is a dedicated process-route for the production of silicon with purities of 6N (99.9999%) and less energy demand.|$|R

We found {{the rotation of}} feed and <b>seed</b> <b>rods</b> {{play a crucial role}} in growing high quality single crystal. Systematic investigations suggest the occurrence of a phase separation at microscopic level, such as the separation into Na-rich and Na-poor domains during the growth, and formation of impurity phase(s) depending on growth conditions. NaxCoO 2 (x = 0. 30, 0. 60) crystals have been prepared by sodium deintercalation from Na 0. 75 CoO 2. Powder X-ray and energy dispersive X-ray analyses have confirmed the phase purity and homogeneity of the samples. Magnetic susceptibility measurements of x = 0. 60 and 0. 75 crystals indicate a bulk phase transition at 22 K and an anomaly around 339 K and 334 K respectively which are attributed to structural transition. In addition some unique features related to Na 0. 60 CoO 2 were observed. Comment: 23 Pages, 12 Figure...|$|R

40|$|Oriented bicrystals of pure C 11 b MoSi 2 {{have been}} grown in a tri-arc furnace using the Czochralski technique. Two single crystal seeds {{were used to}} {{initiate}} the growth.

Seeds were attached to a water-cooled <b>seed</b> <b>rod,</b> which was pulled at 120 mm/h with the <b>seed</b> <b>rod</b> rotating at 45 rpm. The water- cooled copper hearth was counter-rotated at 160 rpm. Asymmetric growth ridges associated with each seed crystal were observed during growth and confirmed the existence of a bicrystal. It was also found that careful alignment of the seeds was needed to keep the grain boundary from growing out of the boule. The resulting boundary was characterized by imaging and crystallographic techniques in a scanning electron microscope. The boundary was found to be fairly sharp and the misorientation between the grains remained within 2 ° from the disorientation between the seeds...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the design of}} a Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) {{equilibrium}} core using thorium is presented; a heterogeneous blanket-seed core arrangement concept was adopted. The design was developed in three steps: in the first step two different assemblies were designed based on the integrated blanket-seed concept, they are the blanket-dummy assembly and the blanket-seed assembly. The integrated blanketseed concept {{comes from the fact that}} the blanket and the <b>seed</b> <b>rods</b> are located in the same assembly, and are burned-out in a once-through cycle. In the second step, a core design was developed to achieve an equilibrium cycle of 365 effective full power days in a standard BWR with a reload of 104 fuel assemblies designed with an average 235 U enrichment of 7. 5 w/o in the seed sub-lattice. The main operating parameters, like power, linear heat generation rate and void distributions were obtained as well as the shutdown margin. It was observed that the analyzed parameters behave like those obtained in a standard BWR. The shutdown margin design criterion was fulfilled by addition of a burnable poison region in the assembly. In the third step an in-house code was developed to evaluate the thorium equilibrium core under transient conditions. A stability analysis was also performed. Regarding the stability analysis, five operational states were analyzed; four of them define the traditional instability region corner of the power-flow map and the fifth one is the operational state for the full power condition. The frequency and the boiling length were calculated for each operational state. The frequency of the analyzed operational states was similar to that reported for BWRs; these are close to the unstable region that occurs due to the density wave oscillation phenomena in some nuclear power plants. Four transient analyses were also performed: manual SCRAM, recirculation pumps trip, main steam isolation valves closure and loss of feed water. The results of these transients are similar to those obtained with the traditional UO 2 nuclear fuel...|$|R
50|$|High-purity, semiconductor-grade silicon (only a few {{parts per}} million of impurities) is melted in a {{crucible}} at 1425 degrees Celsius, usually made of quartz. Dopant impurity atoms such as boron or phosphorus {{can be added to}} the molten silicon in precise amounts to dope the silicon, thus changing it into p-type or n-type silicon, with different electronic properties. A precisely oriented rod-mounted seed crystal is dipped into the molten silicon. The <b>seed</b> crystal's <b>rod</b> is slowly pulled upwards and rotated simultaneously. By precisely controlling the temperature gradients, rate of pulling and speed of rotation, it is possible to extract a large, single-crystal, cylindrical ingot from the melt. Occurrence of unwanted instabilities in the melt can be avoided by investigating and visualizing the temperature and velocity fields during the crystal growth process. This process is normally performed in an inert atmosphere, such as argon, in an inert chamber, such as quartz.|$|R
40|$|Bi- 2212 /Ag superconducting {{ceramics}} {{were grown}} using the electrically assisted laser floating zone (EALFZ) technique. The main goal was improving the superconducting properties by applying an electrical current through the sample during the solidification process. The {{effect of a}} 100 mA current intensities in two configurations were studied: (i) direct current (connecting the <b>seed</b> <b>rod</b> to the positive pole and the feed to the negative one) and (ii) reverse current (positive pole connected to the feed rod and negative to the seed one). The resulting textured cylindrical bars were annealed {{in order to obtain}} the superconducting phases. A strong correlation between current polarity, grain alignment and superconducting properties was observed. The rods grown under direct current exhibit higher critical current density (- 3000 A/cm 2) than the ones grown under conventional method (- 2300 A/cm 2) or under reverse current condition (- 35 A/cm 2). The superior value obtained for the direct current results from a better grain alignment and fewer amount of second phases. The authors are thankful to FCT for the project PEst-C/CTM/LA 0025 / 2011.

40|$|In recent years, a new {{generation}} of quantum confined colloidal semiconductor structures has emerged, with more complex shapes than simple quantum dots 1, 2. These include nanorods 3 and tetrapods 4. Beyond shape, it is also now possible to spatially vary the electron and hole potentials within these nanoparticles by varying the composition. Examples of these new structures include <b>seeded</b> dots, <b>rods,</b> and tetrapods, which contain a CdSe core embedded within a CdS shell 5, 6. These structures may have many uses beyond those envisioned for simple quantum dots, which are frequently employed in luminescent applications 7. This paper is concerned with changes in the optoelectronic properties of tetrapods when the arms are bent. We demonstrate that seeded tetrapods can serve as an optical strain gauge, capable of measuring forces on the order of nanonewtons. We anticipate that a nanocrystal strain gauge with optical readout will be useful for applications ranging from sensitive optomechanical devices to biological force investigations...|$|R

40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} is one approach {{to address the}} donor-organ shortage, but to attain clinically significant viable cell densities in thick tissues, laboratory-constructed tissues must have an internal vascular supply. We have adopted a biomimetic approach and assembled microscale modular components, consisting of submillimeter-sized collagen gel <b>rods</b> <b>seeded</b> with endothelial cells (ECs) into a (micro) vascularized tissue; in some prototypes the gel contained HepG 2 cells to illustrate the possibilities. The EC-covered modules then were assembled into a larger tube and perfused with medium or whole blood. The interstitial spaces among the modules formed interconnected channels that enabled this perfusion. Viable cell densities were high, within {{an order of magnitude}} of cell densities within tissues, and the percolating nature of the flow through the construct was evident in microcomputed tomography and Doppler ultrasound measurements. Most importantly, the ECs retained their nonthrombogenic phenotype and delayed clotting times and inhibited the loss of platelets associated with perfusion of whole blood through the construct. Unlike the conventional scaffold and cell-seeding paradigm of other tissue-engineering approaches, this modular construct {{has the potential to be}} scalable, uniform, and perfusable with whole blood, circumventing the limitations of other approaches...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} work, for {{the first}} time, investigated metal semiconductor-metal (MSM) zine oxide (ZnO) nanorod based ultra-violet (UV) detectors having a Wheatstone bridge design with a high responsivity at room temperature and above, {{as well as a}} responsivity that was largely independent of the change in ambient conditions. The ZnO nanorods which acted as the sensing element of the detector were grown by a chemical growth technique. Studies were conducted to determine the effects on ZnO nanorod properties by varying the concentration of the chemicals used for the rod growth. These studies showed how the rod diameter and the deposition of ZnO nanorods from the solution was controlled by varying the concentration of the chemicals used for the rod growth. Conventional MSM UV detectors were fabricated with ZnO nanorods grown under optimized conditions to determine the dependence of UV response on electrode dimension and rod dimension. These studies gave insights into the dependence of UV response on the width of the electrode, spacing between the electrodes, density of the rod growth, and length and diameter of the rods. The UV responsivity was affected by varying the number of times the seed layer was spin coated, by varying the spin speed of seed layer coating and by varying the annealing temperature of the <b>seed</b> and <b>rod.</b> Based on these studies, optimum conditions for the fabrication of Wheatstone bridge UV ZnO nanorod detectors were determined. The Wheatstone bridge ZnO nanorod UV detectors were fabricated in three different configurations, namely, symmetric, asymmetric, and quasi-symmetric. The transient responses of the symmetric, asymmetric and quasi-symmetric configurations at room temperature and above showed how the response stability differed. At high temperature the responsivity of quasi-symmetric Wheatstone bridge detector configuration did not drop after saturation and the responsivity drifted by 17 % to 25 % from the room temperature response. The responsivity of quasisymmetric Wheatstone bridge configuration with good temperature stability was 1. 16 A/W, while those of conventional MSM UV detectors were approximately 60 A/W. However, the quasi-symmetric Wheatstone bridge with responsivity 1. 16 A/W was higher than the commercially available detector having responsivity of only about 0. 1 A/W. Though the response of quasi-symmetric Wheatstone bridge detector was higher than the detectors available commercially, the response time was very high. The response time of quasi-symmetric Wheatstone bridge was approximately 159 seconds at room temperature, while that of commercially available detectors is of the order of microseconds. If the quasi-symmetric Wheatstone bridge has to compete with current commercially available detectors, then the response time should be brought down from seconds to microseconds. Based on these studies, an improved design of the quasi-symmetric Wheatstone bridge UV detector with the ZnO rods oriented parallel to the substrate instead of oriented vertical to the substrate was proposed...|$|R
40|$|Semiconducting CdSe nanocrystals (NCs) are {{a unique}} class of {{materials}} that exhibit properties that are dependant on their size, morphology and composition. When the radius of a nanocrystal is decreased below its Bohr exciton radius, the nanocrystal exhibits quantum confinement, and the bandgap {{of the material}} increases as the radius decreases. When the morphology of a NC is changed from a zero-dimensional quantum dot (QD) to a one-dimensional quantum rod (QR), the material begins to show new properties such as the emission of polarized light and switching behavior in electric fields. Synthesis of QRs is not trivial, however, and to date {{a number of different}} approaches have been developed using an initial QD which acts as a <b>seed</b> for further <b>rod</b> growth. One such method of this seeded growth of QRs is the low-temperature redox-assisted growth of NCs in 9 : 1 3 -amino- 1 -propanol:water mixtures. By tuning the concentration of dissolved O 2 in 9 : 1 3 -amino- 1 -propanol:water, the growth of NCs can be directed along the NCs c-axis at high O 2 concentrations, and can proceed in three dimensions when the concentration of O 2 is reduced. This occurs because of selective O 2 passivation of the nonpolar NC facets while on the polar facets remain relatively unpassivatcd. By adding different precursors to the NC growth solution, the growth can be further tuned to produce high aspect ratio rods or promote large scale three dimensional growth. Low-temperature, redox-assisted growth {{can also be used to}} fabricate both one-dimensional rod and three-dimensional core-shell heterostructures. Finally, this growth method can be tuned to fuse NCs in a film that is deposited on a substrate, which has profound implications for devices such as photovoltaics. ^ The role of O 2 on directing seeded CdSe NC growth, as well as the fabrication of one-dimensional CdSe/CdxHg 1 −x Se heterostructures, is described in Chapter 2 of this dissertation. The role of the anionic precursor is explored in Chapter 3 of this dissertation, which can lead to the fabrication of a CdSeCdSexTe 1 −x core-shell heterostructure, which is reported in Chapter 4. Finally, the deposition and growth of CdSe films, including NC fusion is reported in Chapter 5. The use of this technology to fabricate a crude Grätzel-type of photovoltaic is also reported in Chapter 5, highlighting the general applicability of the low-temperature, redox-assisted growth of CdSe NCs. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were (a) to measure the amount of cross-pollination caused by three bee species at 10, 20 and 40 rods distance from a foreign pollen source, (b) to measure the effects of bee species, planting pattern and season on broad sense heritability estimates for seed yield in alfalfa, (c) to determine the incidence of selfing caused by the bees, (d) to investigate the usefulness of bees as a breeding tool in alfalfa and (e) to determine which of the three planting patterns used in this investigation is the best in effecting the maximum amount of cross-pollination. Three bee species, the honey bee, Apis mellifera L.; the leaf-cutter bee, Megachile rotundata F. and the alkali bee, Nomia melanderi Ckll. were chosen for this investigation because of their importance as pollinators in alfalfa. Studies under conditions of good isolation for bee species and competitive bloom were necessary to obtain reliable results. In the center of a three mile square isolated area, seven plots of recessive white-flowered clonally established plants were planted 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 240 and 320 rods north of a colored-flowered population, and seven plots were planted at the same distance east of the colored-flowered population. Seven planting patterns were used in the east series. Three of these were utilized by the bees described. The number of florets tripped, pods developed and seeds developed in each pod were recorded for each raceme visited by pollen collecting bees. Seed samples from the white-flowered clones were grown in a greenhouse to ascertain whether the seed resulted from cross- or self-pollination. A record of flower color in 1963 demonstrated that at 10, 20 and 40 rods from a contaminant source honey bees caused 15. 7, 11. 2 and 5. 8 percent cross-pollination; leaf-cutter bees caused 13. 1, 4. 8 and 8. 1 percent cross-pollination while endemic pollinators caused 42. 9, 30. 9 and 10. 0 percent cross-pollination in 1962. An important fact in this regard was that endemic pollinators caused 6. 52 percent cross-pollination at a distance of a mile. Bee species, planting pattern and season caused large fluctuations in broad sense heritability estimates for seed yield in alfalfa. The ratio environmental variance to phenotypic variance gave a good indication which environmental factor caused the most fluctuation in the estimate. When endemic pollinators were used 94. 7, 88. 3, 36. 3 and 23. 1 percent selfed seeds were recorded as occurring in pods with one, two, three and four or more seeds per pod. One seven seeded pod was recorded as possessing three selfed seeds. Data from leaf-cutter bees showed that all of the pod types had over 67 percent selfed seeds. Distance from the contaminant source affected the percentage selfed <b>seeds.</b> At 40 <b>rods</b> only the four or more seeded pods contained any crossed seeds (20 percent) Leaf-cutter bees trip 27 - 50 percent more florets per raceme and cause less cross-pollination at 10, 20 and 40 rods than honey bees. Honey bees cause approximately the same amount of cross-pollination at 10 and 20 rods while the value obtained at 20 rods for the leaf-cutter bee was close to one-third of the value at 10 rods. Leaf-cutter bees also showed less preference between colored- and white-flowered alfalfa flowers. Of several planting patterns considered, maximum cross-pollination was obtained in a plot planted with alternating rows of alfalfa...|$|R
