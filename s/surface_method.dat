50|$|In {{response}} surface methodology, {{the objective is}} to find the relationship between the input variables and the response variables. The process starts from trying to fit a linear regression model. If the P-value turns out to be low, then a higher degree polynomial regression, which is usually quadratic, will be implemented. The process of finding a good relationship between input and response variables will be done for each simulation test. In simulation optimization, response <b>surface</b> <b>method</b> can be used to find the best input variables that produce desired outcomes in terms of response variables.|$|E
50|$|Several {{of these}} albums have become cult classics, but their {{releases}} have typically been {{overshadowed by the}} fans' steady desire to hear RZA production on Wu-Tang projects. The pure volume of Wu-Tang-affiliated material and side projects began to tire critics, {{and a lack of}} focus was commonly attributed to the music.

True Master took on the bulk of Wu-Element production duties for the year, contributing tracks to U-God's solo debut Golden Arms Redemption and Ol' Dirty Bastard's sophomore effort, Nigga Please; Mathematics produced songs for Uncontrolled Substance as well as GZA's second album, Beneath the <b>Surface,</b> <b>Method</b> Man's collaboration with fellow Def Jam Records rapper Redman entitled Blackout!, a Wu-Tang Clan contribution to Ice Cube's Friday soundtrack, and an underground RZA-executive-produced project called Wu-Syndicate by duo Mayalanski and Joe Mafia.|$|E
5000|$|Another revival {{began in}} the 1980s. One cause was the {{discovery}} in 1982 by Celso Costa of a surface that disproved the conjecture that the plane, the catenoid, and the helicoid are the only complete embedded minimal surfaces in R3 of finite topological type. This not only stimulated new work on using the old parametric methods, but also demonstrated the importance of computer graphics to visualise the studied surfaces and numerical methods to solve the [...] "period problem" [...] (when using the conjugate <b>surface</b> <b>method</b> to determine surface patches that can be assembled into a larger symmetric surface, certain parameters need to be numerically matched to produce an embedded surface). Another cause was the verification by H. Karcher that the triply periodic minimal surfaces originally described empirically by Alan Schoen in 1970 actually exist.

40|$|We propose “low cost {{response}} <b>surface</b> <b>methods</b> ” (LCRSM) {{that typically}} require half the experimental runs of standard response <b>surface</b> <b>methods</b> based on central composite and Box Behnken designs but yield comparable or lower modeling errors under realistic assumptions. In addition, the LCRSM methods have substantially lower modeling errors and greater expected savings compared with alternatives with comparable numbers of runs, including small composite designs and computer-generated designs based on popular criteria such as D-optimality. Therefore, when simulation runs are expensive, low cost response <b>surface</b> <b>methods</b> {{can be used}} to create regression meta-models for queuing or other system optimization. The LCRSM procedures are also apparently the first experimental design methods derived as the solution to a simulation optimization problem. For these reasons, we say that LCRSM are “for and from ” simulation optimization. We compare the proposed LCRSM methods with a large number of alternatives based on six criteria. We conclude that the proposed methods offer attractive alternative to current methods in many relevant situations. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this {{research}} we evaluate {{the effects of}} the method used for estimating the potential surface available for benthic macroinvertebrates in macrophyte and unvegetated habitats on several metrics and habitat preference of aquatic macroinvertebrates in the upper catchment of the Henares River (Guadalajara, Central Spain). Three sampling sites were selected: a well-preserved stream (site A), a stream with no wood riparian vegetation (site B), and a straightened and deforested reach (site C). Two habitats were selected in each site: unvegetated habitat (i. e., substrata without macrophytes) and macrophyte habitat (i. e., substrata covered by macrophytes). In each habitat, six macroinvertebrate samples (including all macrophytes or mineral particles) were collected using a Hess sampler. Diversity and density of major families were referred {{to the surface of the}} Hess sampler (=Hess <b>surface</b> <b>method)</b> and to the actual surface of either mineral particles or macrophytes (=actual <b>surface</b> <b>method).</b> In general, for the actual <b>surface</b> <b>method,</b> biomass, richness, dominance, and diversity metrics were higher in the mineral habitat than in the macrophyte habitat. This trend was different for the Hess <b>surface</b> <b>method.</b> In general, densities turned out to be higher in the unvegetated habitat than in the macrophyte habitat when using the actual <b>surface</b> <b>method,</b> but the reverse occurred when using the Hess <b>surface</b> <b>method.</b> This fact is relevant for river biomonitoring, especially when reaches with different dominant substrates (macrophytes vs mineral) are compared using just one of the methods.
