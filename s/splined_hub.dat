5000|$|In late 2009, Traxxas {{released}} the E-Maxx Brushless Edition (model 3908). It features the same Castle Creations [...] "NEU" [...] brushless motor and [...] "Mamba Monster" [...] brushless ESC as the E-Revo Brushless Edition. Other features included 17 mm <b>splined</b> <b>hubs,</b> a wheelie bar, Traxxas' 2.4GHz radio system, dual waterproof digital high-torque steering servos, heavy duty slipper clutch, 6.3 inch [...] "Giant Maxx" [...] tires, white progressive rate springs, black-chrome wheels and bumpers, and new paint and graphics.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} {{initially}} named Rudge-Whitworth Milano, as the <b>splined</b> <b>hub</b> locking mechanism was licensed from the Coventry-based Rudge-Whitworth, which had developed the patents since 1908. It {{was run by}} Carlo Borrani at Via Ugo Bassi 9, and quickly became supplier for Alfa Romeo, Bianchi, Lancia and other racing cars, used by such drivers as Enzo Ferrari when winning the first Coppa Acerbo in Pescara (1924). Leadership transferred to Cesare Borrani in 1937.|$|E

5000|$|The {{design of}} the hub has three main {{elements}} - a <b>splined</b> <b>hub</b> to locate the wheel and two mating cones, one at the inner end which centres the wheel and the other at the nut end. These cones transmit {{the majority of the}} torque to the wheel freeing the splines of much of the load. One of the key features of the Pugh design is that it is self tightening. The wheels {{on the right side of}} the car have a left hand thread on the nut and vice versa. If the wheel becomes loose the tendency is for the locking nut to tighten and hold the wheel securely.|$|E
5000|$|Later in 2008, Traxxas {{released}} a {{revised version of}} the Revo 3.3. It incorporated some of the features seen on the Revo platinum, including a polished [...] "Resonator" [...] dual chamber exhaust pipe, dual stage air filter, larger 150 cc fuel tank, teflon coated aluminum [...] "GTR" [...] shocks with titanium nitride shafts, 17 mm <b>splined</b> wheel <b>hubs.</b> As is typical of a new Traxxas model, the revised Revo 3.3 received a new paint scheme.|$|R
5000|$|Freehub-- The {{mechanism}} {{that allows the}} rider to coast {{is built into the}} <b>hub.</b> <b>Splines</b> on the freehub body allow a single sprocket or, more commonly, a cassette containing several sprockets to be slid on.

2500|$|BSA {{produced}} the first Sunbeam bicycle catalogue in 1949 and produced its own '4 Star' derailleur gear with an associated <b>splined</b> cassette <b>hub</b> and 4 sprocket cassette. [...] This design {{was different from}} the 1930s Bayliss Wiley cassette hub which had a threaded sprocket carrier. [...] BSA bought New Hudson motorcycle and bicycle business in 1950 and followed this up in 1951 with the purchase of [...] Triumph Motorcycles which brought Jack Sangster onto the BSA board. The effect of this acquisition was to make BSA into the largest producer of [...] motorcycles in the world at that time.|$|R
5000|$|The wheel {{diameter}} on a trials unicycle is usually 19" [...] or 20", as this allows greater maneuverability {{due to the}} short circumference of the wheel. Most Trials unicycles come with 19" [...] rear rims as used on 20" [...] (or mod) trials bicycles. This allows for larger tyres to be fitted which can help provide bounce and preload for jumping, and aid stability being generally quite wide (some up to 2.5 inches).A smaller wheel also means the unicycle is lighter, although some riders prefer larger wheels. The tire is generally wide and thick, giving a large air volume. This is to cushion drops and allow large hops and jumps. The tire will often have a deep tread to allow greater grip to obstacles. Strong high tension spokes and a strong rim wheel rim is used to prevent the wheel from deforming under the great stresses exerted on it by jumping. Unicycle wheels have to withstand large lateral stresses because, unlike in conventional riding, the rider may jump sideways. Many trials unicycles have a <b>splined</b> <b>hub</b> and cranks, as this design {{tends to be more}} resistant to bending and breaking than the more common cotterless, or square taper, equivalent. Long cranks give the rider extra torque and pedals with a large amount of grip (often with pins or teeth) are used to prevent the rider's feet from slipping. Unicycles with shorter cranks are generally referred to as street unicycles, as they let the rider keep up their momentum easier and do smooth tricks. Whereas Trials unicycles usually have longer cranks that are better for hopping, as the rider has better control of the rotation of the wheel, and can therefore keep the unicycle from slipping out from under him.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this article, {{a method}} of data fusion based on contour of parts is {{proposed}} for multi-factors measurement. Contour of the parts {{is used as a}} reference to fusing data because it is more sensitive to the angular changes than other parts and the relative positions between the contour and other individual part are fixed. This method not only is a reference to fuse data from multi-sensors, but also could apply feedback control for the measurement system. A key part of automotive transmission named <b>splined</b> <b>hub</b> has been used in the verification experiment in which the principle and structure of the measurement system is introduced...|$|E
2500|$|Bicycle wheels {{were not}} strong enough for cars [...] until the {{development}} of tangentially spoked wheels. They rapidly became well established in the bicycle and motor tricycle world but were not common on cars until around 1907. This was encouraged by the Rudge-Whitworth patented detachable and interchangeable wheels designed by John Pugh. These wheels owed their resistance to braking and accelerative stresses to their two inner rows of tangential spokes. An outer row of radial spokes gave lateral strength against cornering strains. These wheels were deeply dished so that steering pivot pins might lie as near {{as possible to the}} center-line of the tires. Their second feature was that they were easily detachable [...] being mounted on <b>splined</b> false <b>hubs.</b>|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 83 - 85) Today???s Mechanical Engineering {{field is}} growing rapidly in designing techniques to manufacture Splines and Gears. Over the decades, numerous methods and manufacturing processes {{have been used}} in making the various kinds of Splines based on various criteria, including applications, reliability, life time, processing time and manufacturing cost. This thesis is also carried out with the same notion of experimenting to manufacture an External Involute Spline cutting tool using state-of-art CAD/CAM package and current trend CNC machines like Brother HS- 70 A Wire Electrical Discharge Machine and HAAS VF- 2 Vertical Milling Machine. This thesis is divided into two distinct phases: (1) analysis phase and (2) manufacturing phase. The analysis phase is dedicated to the study and simulation of involute splines, while the manufacturing phase covers the actual manufacturing process. This thesis starts with the extensive study of splines and the two different kinds of splines; a) Internal Involute splines and b) External Involute splines. The primary objective is to design the internal involute spline in Dassault Systems??? SolidWorks??. This entire design process is to be automated with embedding Microsoft EXCEL Spreadsheet with SolidWorks. Using this EXCEL spreadsheet, spline design parameters iterations are carried out in SolidWorks with the help of design tables. Based on the calculations made in EXCEL Spreadsheets and CAD design in SolidWorks, CNC machining parameters are defined in DP Technology???s CAM package ESPRIT and the machining process as well as tool/insert design is simulated. The main objective is to manufacture a spline cutting tool using Wire EDM machining process. For this Solid Carbide Machine Inserts are chosen as a cutting tool which cuts the external splines. Once the machine insert was manufactured, it was tested on 6061 Aluminum test specimen and successfully cut on 4340 Steel Drive shaft on the CNC Milling machine. These external splines are the inverse of the Involute splines on the drive shaft hub of the FSAE Formula one car. It can be concluded that, the involute spline cutting tool was successfully manufactured and tested by cutting external involute splines on drive shaft which match with internal <b>splines</b> on drive <b>hub...</b>|$|R
