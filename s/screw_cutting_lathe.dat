50|$|A {{critical}} factor in making interchangeable metal parts was the invention of several machine tools, such as the slide rest lathe, <b>screw</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe,</b> turret lathe, milling machine and metal planer. One {{of the most important}} and versatile of these machine tools was David Wilkinson's lathe, for which he received a $10,000 award from the government of the United States.|$|E

50|$|In 1995 one non-academic source erroneously {{suggested}} that Neumann <b>cutting</b> <b>lathes</b> applied a single high-frequency pole at 3.18 µs (50 kHz) {{and that a}} complementary zero should therefore be included upon playback. However, no such pole exists.|$|R

50|$|A {{technological}} spin-off from the short-lived TeD video system was Teldec's Direct Metal Mastering technology, called DMM, for the manufacturing of vinyl records: The <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe</b> engraves the audio signal groove {{directly into a}} copper-plated master disc, instead of a lacquer-plated aluminium disc.|$|R
50|$|While Linn {{engineers}} were testing their flagship product, the Sondek LP12 turntable, they became frustrated {{with some of}} the specialist test LPs they were using. Work began on an LP <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe</b> as a research product to improve testing for the LP12.|$|R
50|$|Samuel Rhee {{developed}} his own endless <b>screw</b> <b>cutting</b> machine {{and was able}} to sell machines to others. His screws were considered the finest available at the time.|$|R
50|$|Georg Neumann GmbH (Neumann), {{founded in}} 1928 and based in Berlin, Germany, is a {{prominent}} manufacturer of professional recording microphones. Their best-known products are condenser microphones for broadcast, live and music production purposes. For several decades Neumann {{was also a}} leading manufacturer of <b>cutting</b> <b>lathes</b> for phonograph disks, and even ventured into the field of mixing desks for a while.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{systems have}} far wider {{potential}} bandwidth. An essential feature of all cutting lathes—including the Neumann cutting lathes—is a forcibly imposed high frequency roll-off above the audio band (>20 kHz). This implies {{two or more}} additional time constants to those defined by the RIAA curve. This is not standardized anywhere, but set by the maker of the <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe</b> and associated electronics.|$|R
50|$|The {{official}} RIAA standard defines three time-constants with pre-emphasis rising indefinitely above 75 µs, but {{in practice}} this is not possible. When the RIAA equalization standard was written the inherent bandwidth limitations of the recording equipment and <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe</b> imposed their own ultimate upper limit on the pre-emphasis characteristic, so no official upper limit {{was included in the}} RIAA definition.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the archetypal}} {{toolpath}} of a planer is linear, helical cutting {{can be accomplished}} by coupling the table's linear motion to simultaneous rotation. The helical planing idea is similar to both helical milling and single-point <b>screw</b> <b>cutting.</b>|$|R

This also includes the mastering of music specifically for vinyl records.|$|R
50|$|The <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe</b> for DMM engraves {{the audio}} signal {{directly}} onto a copper-plated master disc, instead of engraving the groove into a lacquer-coated aluminum disc. Examination of early DMM discs revealed {{what appeared to}} be a high frequency modulation in the groove, thought to be caused by the use of an ultrasonic carrier tone. In fact, there was no carrier tone and the modulation was simply caused by the vibration (squeal) of the cutter head as it was dragged through the copper disc.|$|R
50|$|Transcription or {{recording}} lathes {{are used}} to make grooves on a surface for recording sounds. These were used in creating sound grooves on wax cylinders and then on flat recording discs. Originally the <b>cutting</b> <b>lathes</b> were driven by sound vibrations through a horn and then later driven by electric current, when microphones were used in recording. Many of these were professional models, {{but there were some}} used for home recording and were popular before the advent of home tape recording.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2017, Sony {{announced}} that by March 2018 {{it would be}} producing vinyl records in-house {{for the first time}} since ceasing their production in 1989. Reporting the decision, the BBC noted that, [...] "Sony's move comes a few months after it equipped its Tokyo studio with a <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe,</b> used to produce the master discs needed for manufacturing vinyl records" [...] but added that [...] "Sony is even struggling to find older engineers who know how to make records".|$|R
50|$|Some lathes {{have only}} one {{leadscrew}} that serves all carriage-moving purposes. For <b>screw</b> <b>cutting,</b> a half nut is engaged {{to be driven by}} the leadscrew's thread; and for general power feed, a key engages with a keyway cut into the leadscrew to drive a pinion along a rack that is mounted along the lathe bed.|$|R
5000|$|The company's first tape recorder, the Ampex Model 200, {{was first}} shipped in April 1948. The first two units, serial numbers 1 and 2, {{were used to}} record the Bing Crosby Show. [...] The American Broadcasting Company used these {{recorders}} along with 3M Scotch 111 gamma ferric oxide coated acetate tape for the first-ever U.S. delayed radio broadcast of The Bing Crosby Show. Ampex tape recorders revolutionized the radio and recording industries because of their superior audio quality and ease of operation over audio disk <b>cutting</b> <b>lathes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1767, Voigtländer invented two {{important}} tools: a linear device for natural and tapered gauges, and a circular device for elevation, astrolabe, and cartography etc. Including, a <b>screw</b> <b>cutting</b> machine, a metal lathe and finishing rollers for sheep wool and silk factories. The production program was supplemented by compasses, tweezers, levelling devices, dioptres and other fine mechanical products.|$|R
5000|$|In 1862, Thwaites and Carbutt {{exhibited}} {{a selection of}} machine tools at the London Exhibition. These included a seven hundredweight double-action self-acting steam hammer; a four hundredweight double-action single standard hammer; a pillar radial drilling machine; a six-inch centre slide and <b>screw</b> <b>cutting</b> lathe; a [...] "very powerful" [...] planing machine; and a ten-inch centre double-geared slide lathe.|$|R

50|$|Another {{primary focus}} of Wreck Racing is to fortify {{scientific}} design and analysis methods taught in the GA Tech classrooms through practical application. The team frequently utilizes finite element and signal analysis, circuit design, CAD modeling and drawing, thermodynamic and fluid dynamic analysis, along with advanced fabrication techniques, such as state-of-the-art CNC milling, radiator fin augmentation, waterjet and plasma <b>cutting,</b> <b>lathe</b> operation, welding, and precision measuring {{with the goal of}} producing exceptional vehicle performance while remaining within the severe budget and time restrictions mandated by the competition rules.|$|R
5000|$|The model A had an {{optional}} inch or metric screw-cutting gearbox and power cross-feed. The {{addition of the}} letters, [...] "UD" [...] to the model letter signifies [...] "Under Drive". Model AUD is a Model A with the Under Drive mount. The four lathes (A,B, C, and T) were dimensionally identical but with different features. Model A was {{the top of the}} line with the screw-cutting gearbox. Model B was next with power cross feed and manual gear change for <b>screw</b> <b>cutting.</b> Model C had manual cross-feed and manual gear change for <b>screw</b> <b>cutting.</b> Model T was the Training lathe. The VSL (for late machines, VSL500) was an AUD with infinitely-variable spindle speed control, larger bore through spindle, 'L00' fitting for chucks instead of the threaded fitting of the other models and some other uprated features making it more attractive to industry. The lathes were based on the design of the very successful American South Bend Lathe models.|$|R
5000|$|He built {{a simple}} passive mixing system that {{directly}} fed the electronics of his Ampex 350 and 351 tape machines. Also, DuNann told Stereophile that Contemporary sessions were recorded [...] "dry" [...] (without electronic echo added or in a reverberant room). Sometimes, {{such as in}} the case of Sonny Rollins' Way Out West, a plate reverb unit was inserted between the tape machine and the LP disc <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe.</b> This is why some later LP and CD reissues of Contemporary albums sound [...] "dry" [...] and [...] "dead" [...] compared to the original LPs mastered by DuNann.|$|R
50|$|The Model 700 was {{available}} in several different versions. In its most basic incarnation, it had two line-level, balanced inputs. One popular upgrade was the addition {{of one or two}} microphone preamps, which were installed on removable cards into slots in the machine. These allowed stereo recording directly into the Model 700, bypassing a mixing console. Since the recorder had a significantly lower noise floor than most mixers of the same era, this method made the best use of the system's available dynamic range. Another, much more rare accessory was the Model 700D Disc Mastering Delay. This was a device used for mastering vinyl records, and attached to a proprietary 25-pin digital output {{on the back of the}} Model 700 recorder. Because of the nature of vinyl records (which rotate at a constant angular velocity but at a changing linear velocity with respect to the needle as it moves inwards), it is necessary to send the audio signal to the computer controlling the movement (pitch) of the <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe.</b> In this way, during quiet passages the pitch is decreased thus enabling more grooves per inch. The computer needs an audio signal that is exactly one rotation ahead of the actual audio fed to the <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe,</b> so that it can move the cutting head rapidly forward before a loud passage is grooved. The disc mastering delay achieved this just like the analog mastering tape decks that used an extra playback head for this purpose.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century Henry Augustus Rowland found {{a need for}} very high {{precision}} <b>screws</b> in <b>cutting</b> diffraction gratings, so he developed a technique for making them.|$|R
50|$|An analog {{recording}} {{is one where}} a property or characteristic of a physical recording medium is made to vary in a manner analogous to the variations in air pressure of the original sound. Generally, the air pressure variations are first converted (by a transducer such as a microphone) into an electrical analog signal in which either the instantaneous voltage or current is directly proportional to the instantaneous air pressure (or {{is a function of}} the pressure). The variations of the electrical signal in turn are converted to variations in the recording medium by a recording machine such as a tape recorder or <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe.</b> Examples of properties that are modified are the magnetization of magnetic tape or the deviation (or displacement) of the groove of a gramophone disc from a smooth, flat spiral track.|$|R
50|$|The {{very high}} output {{impedance}} of valves (compared with transistors) usually requires matching transformers to drive low impedance loads such as loudspeakers or <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe</b> heads. The transformer {{is used as}} the load, {{in place of the}} resistor usually used in small-signal and driver stages. The reflected impedance of the transformer primary at the frequencies in use is much higher than the DC resistance of the windings, often kilohms. High performance transformers are, however, severe engineering compromises, are expensive and, in operation, are far from ideal. Output transformers dramatically increase the cost of a valve amplifier circuit compared to a direct-coupled transistor alternative. However, in both tube and solid state amps, matching output transformers are required for public address applications where low-loss high impedance/high voltage lines are used to connect multiple distant loudspeakers.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{business}} management, {{the identification}} of high priority resources represents an important issue. In this paper we developed a new method based on a multi-criteria approach to identify critical resources. Eight prioritisation criteria involved in the company's global performance are proposed. The originality of our method is {{to take into account}} both material and human resources of company. Accordingly, a human-machine availability including the versatility of machine-operators is developed. We applied our method in a French <b>screw</b> <b>cutting</b> company.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, the <b>screw</b> <b>cutting</b> {{experiments}} {{of stainless}} steel 15 - 5 PH {{was carried out by}} employing the tapping center in order to investigate the tool damage of threading tap tool. Mainly, the effect of the machining conditions and the ground chamfer shape of tap tool on the thrust force and the tool wear were discussed. As a result, {{it was found that the}} thrust force was strongly influenced by the ground amount of tap tool chamfer. Especially, large change of thrust force occurred when the tap tool engaged to the pilot hole and returned out of hole...|$|R
5000|$|In 1977 Mobile Fidelity {{began to}} produce a line of records known as [...] "Original Master Recording" [...] vinyl LPs. These albums were {{previously}} released by other companies, licensed by Mobile Fidelity, and remastered by a process called half-speed mastering. During mastering, sound was transferred from magnetic tape to disc while the <b>cutting</b> <b>lathe</b> moved at half speed. The albums were remastered from the original analog master tapes, without compression, and with minimal equalization. The recordings were pressed on high-quality vinyl called JVC Supervinyl, a plastic compound invented by JVC {{to compensate for the}} demands of Quadrophonic records, which had begun appearing in the 1970s. JVC Supervinyl was more durable than regular vinyl, with lower surface noise and fewer pops and clicks. Mobile Fidelity packaged their albums in heavy cardboard sleeves, inner cardboard stiffeners, and plastic liners.|$|R
