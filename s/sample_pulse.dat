50|$|Pulse oximetry is {{particularly}} convenient for noninvasive continuous measurement of blood oxygen saturation. In contrast, blood gas levels must otherwise be determined {{in a laboratory}} on a drawn blood <b>sample.</b> <b>Pulse</b> oximetry is useful in any setting where a patient's oxygenation is unstable, including intensive care, operating, recovery, emergency and hospital ward settings, pilots in unpressurized aircraft, for assessment of any patient's oxygenation, and determining the effectiveness of or need for supplemental oxygen. Although a pulse oximeter is used to monitor oxygenation, it cannot determine the metabolism of oxygen, or the amount of oxygen being used by a patient. For this purpose, {{it is necessary to}} also measure carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. It is possible that it {{can also be used to}} detect abnormalities in ventilation. However, the use of a pulse oximeter to detect hypoventilation is impaired with the use of supplemental oxygen, as it is only when patients breathe room air that abnormalities in respiratory function can be detected reliably with its use. Therefore, the routine administration of supplemental oxygen may be unwarranted if the patient is able to maintain adequate oxygenation in room air, since it can result in hypoventilation going undetected.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{the design}} of an active matrix LCD, {{the ratio of the}} pixel voltage to the video voltage, {{abbreviated}} to RPV, is an important metric of the performance, since the pixel voltage determines the transmitted luminance of the pixel. Hence, in {{the design of}} a source driver circuit for an LCD, of primal importance is the issue of how to restrict the admissible allowance of the RPV of a pixel within a specified narrow range. This constraint on the RPV is analyzed in terms of parameters associated with the sampling switch and the <b>sampling</b> <b>pulse,</b> and then by using a minimal number of these parameters, a design scheme is described dedicatedly for the sampling switch, which finds an optimal sampling switch size and an optimal <b>sampling</b> <b>pulse</b> waveform.

Two of these types of errors are particularly dependent on the frequency band occupied by the input signal. These are: (1) the aliasing errors due to generation of unwanted spectral components and, (2) pulse width errors due to the use of finite width, flat topped pulses when regenerating-the analog signal. Expressions are presented for the spectral densities and total power of these error sources. The particular dependence of each on the location in frequency of the input signal is investigated and discussed. Quantization noise and distortion due to the smoothing filter which is used to reconstruct the signal are not considered in this paper. It is determined that the aliasing noise power {{as a function of the}} ratio of the signal center frequency to the sampling frequency has a series of relative minimums and maximums. A relationship defining the ratios at which the minimums occur is presented. An approximate formulation for the <b>sample</b> <b>pulse</b> width error is presented which allows a simple estimate of its magnitude to be made without knowledge of the smoothing filter transform or the sampling frequency.

This technique is beginning to be applied in heritage science [34, 35]. The phantoms were imaged with a TeraPulse 4000 system (Teraview Ltd, Cambridge, UK) at the University of Western Australia.

The image is formed by raster scanning the beam across the sample in x and y directions. This is a time-domain imaging system, in which each pixel contains the reflected THz pulse signal (amplitude and phase).

Histogram generation has straight forward implementations on digital computers using high level languages. A prototype of an optical-electronic histogram generator has been designed and tested for 1 -D objects using wirewrapped MSI TTL components. The system has shown to be fairly modular in design. The aspects of the extension to two dimensions and the VLSI implementation of this design are discussed. In this paper, we report a VLSI design to be used in a two-dimensional real-time histogram generation scheme. The overall system design is such that the electronic signal obtained from the optically scanned two-dimensional semi- opaque image is processed and displayed within a period of one cycle of the scanning process. Specifically, in the VLSI implementation of the two- dimensional histogram generator, modifications were made to the original design. For the two-dimensional application, the output controller was analyzed as a finite state machine. The process used to describe the required timing signals and translate them to a VLSI finite state machine using Computer Aided Design Tools is discussed. In addition, the circuitry for sampling, binning, and display have been combined with the timing circuitry on one IC. In the original design, the pulse width of the electronically sampled photodetector is limited with an analog one-shot.

40|$|The {{objective}} of these experiments is {{to evaluate the}} performance of two types of ICP-MS device for measurement of actinide isotopes by laser ablation (LA) ICP-MS. The key advantage of ICP-MS compared to monitoring of radioactive decay is that the element need not decay during the measurement time. Hence ICP-MS is much faster for long-lived radionuclides. The LA process yields a transient signal. When spatially resolved analysis is required for small samples, the laser ablation <b>sample</b> <b>pulse</b> lasts only {approx} 10 seconds. It is difficult to measure signals at several isotopes with analyzers that are scanned for such a short sample transient. In this work, a time-of-flight (TOF) ICP-MS device, the GBC Optimass 8000 (Figure 1) is one instrument used. Strictly speaking, ions at different m/z values are not measured simultaneously in TOF. However, they are measured in very rapid sequence {{with little or no}} compromise between the number of m/z values monitored and the performance. Ions can be measured throughout the m/z range in single sample transients by TOF. The other ICP-MS instrument used is a magnetic sector multicollector MS, the NU Plasma 1700 (Figure 2). Up to 8 adjacent m/z values can be monitored at one setting of the magnetic field and accelerating voltage. Three of these m/z values can be measured with an electron multiplier. This device is usually used for high precision isotope ratio measurements with the Faraday cup detectors. The electron multipliers have much higher sensitivity. In our experience with the scanning magnetic sector instrument in Ames, these devices have the highest sensitivity and lowest background of any ICP-MS device. The ability to monitor several ions simultaneously, or nearly so, should make these devices valuable for the intended application: measurement of actinide isotopes at low concentrations in very small samples for nonproliferation purposes.

40|$|Luteal phase {{deficiency}} (LPD) is a reproductive disorder {{associated with}} infertility and spontaneous abortion. This study was undertaken {{to determine whether}} LPD {{might be related to}} an abnormal pattern of gonadotropin secretion. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating the pattern of pulsatile LH secretion in both the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle in normal women (n = 21) and women with LPD (n = 20), which was diagnosed on the basis of two out of phase endometrial biopsies. In addition, we sought to determine whether changes in progesterone (P) pulse patterns could account for the decrease in average serum P levels in women with LPD. To this end, we examined the pulse patterns of P and compared these patterns between normal women and those with LPD. Frequent blood sampling was performed in both groups to determine their respective hormone secretion patterns. In the follicular phase, blood samples were obtained every 10 min for 12 h; in the luteal phase the samples were obtained every 10 min for 12 h; in the luteal LH, FSH, and P were assayed in each <b>sample.</b> <b>Pulse</b> detection was performed by an adaptive threshold method of pulse analysis. The LH pulse frequency was significantly higher in the women with LPD than in the normal women in the early follicular phase [P less than 0. 05; LPD, 12. 8 +/- 1. 4 (+/- SE); normal, 8. 2 +/- 0. 7 pulses/ 12 h]. LH pulse frequency was similar in the early and late follicular phases in the women with LPD, whereas it was higher in the late follicular phase in normal women. Mean serum FSH levels were not different between groups in both the early and late follicular phases. In the luteal phase the P pulse amplitude and mean serum P level were significantly lower in the LPD group than in the normal women (P less than 0. 01). We conclude that 1) a too rapid LH pulse pattern in the early follicular phase may lead to inadequate LH support of the corpus luteum and become manifest as LPD; 2) the mechanism for inadequate P secretion in LPD is decreased P pulse amplitude; 3) the finding of similar serum FSH levels in the two groups in both the early and late follicular phases did not support compromised folliculogenesis as an etiological factor for LPD. ...|$|E
