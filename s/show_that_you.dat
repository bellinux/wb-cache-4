500|$|The BBC {{commissioned}} a second series {{based on the}} studio audience reactions during recordings. As development on series two had reached a relatively late stage when the first had received negative reviews upon transmission, {{it was too late}} to cancel the production. The cast and crew, then, had to work on a show which they knew was widely disliked. Moffat reflects on the experience: [...] "There's no feeling on earth like working on a <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know is doomed and already tanking." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2005, Hewson, Bono and {{designer}} Rogan Gregory co-founded the EDUN fashion label. It {{was intended to}} help bring about positive change in Africa through a fair trade-based relationship rather than by direct aid. Another aim of the label was to set an ethical example in an industry they felt had long exploited child labour. She said they wanted [...] "to <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can make a for-profit business where everybody in the chain is treated well." [...] Hewson had not been particularly interested in fashion prior to this undertaking.|$|E
500|$|Luminosity— Ignite the Night! {{has mostly}} {{received}} positive reviews {{from the general}} public and enthusiasts. James Koehl from Theme Park Insider described it as [...] "The kind of <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can watch over and over from different vantage points and see a different show every time." [...] Jeff Putz, co-creator of PointBuzz and creator of CoasterBuzz said [...] "Luminosity succeeds in keeping the energy of the park's guests very high until the moment they leave." [...] Putz along with others criticized the show as too long and having inconsistent singers.|$|E

I know that there's so many women that feel the same thing after they give birth. You can have your child and you can still have fun and still be sexy and still have dreams and still live for yourself. I'm not embarrassed about it, and I don't feel like I have to protect that side of me because I do believe that {{sexuality}} is a power we all have." ...|$|E

500|$|Meyer {{has been}} {{publicly}} credited with [...] "thoroughly shap...the comedic sensibility" [...] of The Simpsons; in 2000, Mike Scully, the show runner {{for the series}} at the time, called him [...] "the best comedy writer in Hollywood." [...] Scully said he was [...] "the main reason" [...] why The Simpsons [...] still so good after all these years." [...] Vitti has said Meyer's [...] "fingerprints are on nearly every script" [...] and he [...] "exerts as much influence on the show as anyone can without {{being one of the}} creators," [...] while recounting how [...] "a <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have the writer's credit for will run, and the next day people will come up to you and tell you how great it was. Then they'll mention their two favorite lines, and both of them will be George's." [...] Bill Oakley noted Meyer has [...] "he's been there since the beginning adding thousands of jokes and plot twists, etc., that everyone considers classic and brilliant.|$|E
500|$|Since its broadcast, [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{garnered}} {{little to}} no scrutiny from viewers. Vitti has never gotten any questions about the episode, except from his sister-in-law who wanted him to explain the episode for his nephews. [...] " [...] My sister-in-law called me up saying that I {{needed to talk to}} my nephews about how this was wrong that Homer did", Vitti said. [...] "They watched it and had lots of questions for her. And she referred them all to me. So {{there are some people who}} are still bothered by it." [...] The little amount of scrutiny that the episode attracted took The Simpsons staff by surprise, as they anticipated that the episode would generate a lot of controversy. Instead, [...] "Blame It on Lisa", an episode which aired the previous week, caused an uproar in Brazil because of its depiction of the country. It became one of the biggest controversies the series has ever faced. [...] "It just goes to <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> never know what's going to be a problem", Jean said in the DVD commentary for [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's".|$|E
500|$|The album artwork for Irresistible {{was shot}} by Alberto Tolot in April 2001. The front sleeve cover shows Simpson, wearing heavy makeup and with blond hair, dressed in a semi-transparent shirt, raising it a bit to expose her navel. Simpson said [...] "God gave me my body, you know. I'm just doing what I can {{to make it look}} good." [...] Later in an {{interview}} with the Orlando Sentinel, she said that the album art was [...] "a sign of confidence". However, the cover received negative attention from many critics, including the conservative Christian publication Plugged In, which was a strong supporter of Simpson and her virgin image, and Sweet Kisses. They stated, [...] "If anything, Irresistible copes with temptation by yielding to it which, in conjunction with Simpson's general immodesty, models a dubious sexual ethic." [...] Canadian music magazine Chart also gave a negative response, writing [...] "it takes more than wearing see-through clothes, with airbrushed, non-existent nipples, to <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have matured." [...] A few critics criticized the art for being digitally edited, while others commented on Simpson's similarity to Spears. The Japanese version of the album has the same front sleeve artwork as that of [...] "Irresistible" [...] single.|$|E

During the sixteen years from 1933 to 1949 only 570 believers received baptism since every new believer must bring another convert {{to the church}} before baptism was allowed.He said, “The sheep must have life, your behaviour of giving birth to more sheep <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have life”.

500|$|Trial by Jury is {{the only}} Gilbert and Sullivan opera played in one act and the only {{theatrical}} work by W. S. Gilbert without spoken dialogue. However, later Gilbert and Sullivan operas retained a number of patterns seen in Trial. [...] For example, all except The Yeomen of the Guard begin with a chorus number. [...] Also, like Trial by Jury, the later operas generally end with a relatively short finale consisting of a chorus number interspersed with short solos by the principal characters. [...] "Comes the broken flower" [...] (part of No.3) {{was the first in}} a string of meditative [...] "Horatian" [...] lyrics, [...] "mingling happiness and sadness, an acceptance and a smiling resignation". [...] These would, from this point forward, allow the characters, in each of the Savoy operas, an introspective scene where they stop and consider life, in contrast to the foolishness of the surrounding scenes. [...] Like both of the tenor's arias in Trial by Jury, tenor arias in later Savoy operas were set in 6/8 time so frequently that Anna Russell, in her 1953 parody, [...] "How to Write Your Own Gilbert and Sullivan Opera", exclaimed, [...] "the tenor...according to tradition, must sing an aria in 6/8 time, usually accompanying himself on a stringed instrument". [...] In Trial by Jury hypocrisy is revealed as the characters' motivations are held up to satire, and Gilbert mocks the underlying absurdity of the judicial procedures. [...] As Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther explains, Gilbert combines his criticisms with comic entertainment, which renders them more palatable, {{while at the same time}} underlining their truth: [...] "By laughing at a joke you <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> accept its premise." [...] This too would become characteristic of Gilbert's work.|$|E

2500|$|A popular rumor {{circulating}} {{soon after}} the episode alleged that, unaware of being filmed, Caramitru had addressed Dinescu, saying, [...] "Mircea, fă-te că lucrezi!" [...] ("Mircea, pretend you are working!"); this version of events may have started as defamation by political adversaries, {{with the purpose of}} indicating that the Revolution was a carefully staged front for a coup d'état. According to Alex Mihai Stoenescu's research, despite its passing into contemporary folklore, such a phrase was never uttered; instead, the words used were [...] "Mircea, arăţi că lucrezi" [...] ("Mircea, <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are working on something" [...] — while holding Dinescu's booklet in front of camera), to which Dinescu replied [...] "La un apel" [...] (" [...] on an appeal [...] ") — pointing rather to their ill-preparedness and their preoccupation in quickly drafting a proper document.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2013 the FDA {{released}} the observational notes from an inspection of Burzynski {{as a principal}} investigator that took place between January and March 2013. Among the findings were “ to comply with protocol requirements related to the primary outcome, therapeutic response , for 67% of study subjects reviewed during the inspection,” admitting patients who failed to meet inclusion criteria, failing to stop treatment when patients had severe toxic reactions to antineoplastons, and failure to report all adverse events. Further, the FDA told Burzynski, [...] "You failed to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects under your care. Forty-eight (48) subjects experienced 102 investigational overdoses between January 1, 2005 and February 22, 2013 [...] There is no documentation to <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have implemented corrective actions during this time period {{to ensure the safety}} and welfare of subjects.” The FDA also observed that Burzynski had denied patients informed consent by not informing them of extra costs that they might incur during treatment and that he could not account for his stock of the investigational drug. Lastly, the FDA observed: [...] "Your [...] tumor measurements initially recorded on worksheets at baseline and on-study treatment [...] studies for all study subjects were destroyed and are not available for FDA inspectional review", meaning {{that there was no way}} for the FDA to verify either initial tumor sizes or effects that the antineoplastons may have had.|$|E
2500|$|The satire in {{the opera}} {{is focused on}} old-fashioned customs, {{pastoral}} opera conventions, the [...] "popularity of curates, the pose of aristocratic benevolence, and the inebriety of the working man" [...] rather than the broad political satire that would feature {{in many of the}} later Savoy opera librettos. For example, [...] "Sir Marmaduke, my dear young friend Alexis", a recitative among Alexis, Sir Marmaduke and Dr Daly, is a skit on the excessive politeness associated with early nineteenth-century aristocracy, and the incantation scene is a parody of the similar scene in Weber's Der Freischütz. Dr Daly accompanies his Act II song on a flageolet. Gilbert satirises the Victorian temperance movement by introducing a non-alcoholic brindisi with jorums of tea; this is also a dig at Italian operas, many of which contained a brindisi scene. Another burlesque of Italian opera is [...] "Prepare for sad surprises", which is similar to Alfredo's denunciation of Violetta in Verdi's La traviata. Gilbert's satire of these subjects, like most of his satire in the operas, was blunted with gentle humour. [...] As Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther explains, Gilbert characteristically combines his criticisms with comic entertainment, which renders them more palatable, {{while at the same time}} underlining their truth: [...] "By laughing at a joke you <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> accept its premise." [...] Theatrical critic Allardyce Nicoll compared J. W. Wells' speech about blessings being less popular than curses to Mr. Hen's satiric auction speech in The Historical Register for the Year 1736 by Henry Fielding.|$|E
