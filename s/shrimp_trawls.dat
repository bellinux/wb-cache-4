40|$|To obtain some {{fundamental}} suggestions on the gear-efficiency {{of the two}} different types of trawl net, the authors carried out the model experiment, and compared them with each other, basing on the physical characters of the net. The one is a six-seam net used on board of the 2 ̆ 7 Keiten Maru"" (854. 55 GT) for catching the demersal fishes: and here the otter board was rigged between the hand rope and the warp. The other one is <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawl</b> net used on board of the ""Satsunan"" (116. 57 GT) : and the otter board was directly rigged to the wing-tip in a traditional type. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows. (1) In ordinary towing condition, the height of the net mouth of the six-seam net and the <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawl</b> net, marked 3. 5 m and 1 m, respectively. In six-seam net the height of the net mouth (h) can be expressed in the following formula, h= (0. 15 - 0. 053 V) l. where l is maximum breadth of the net mouth without shrinkage in (m), and V is towing speed in (m/sec) when the distance between both wing-tips is about 30 m. In <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawl</b> net, the maximum height of the net mouth is limited by the otter board height. ""(2) The bag net and net shape of the six-seam net look like cigar-shaped and in <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawl</b> net it is conical shaped but short. These are concerned with the planning of the net design. (3) The net resistance of six-seam net is larger than that of <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawl</b> net. At ordinary towing condition the net resistance of six-seam net, marked in 3. 1 7. 0 ton. In <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawl</b> net it marked about 105 275 kg. This difference of the net resistance depends on the scale of each net. Considering from the net shape and other characteristics of net, the six-seam net with V-D type otter board seems to be suitable for catching the demersal fishes, and the <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawl</b> net with one directly rigged to the wing-tip seems to be suitable for shrimps. ...|$|R

40|$|Tropical <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawl</b> {{fisheries}} are unsustainable, {{and similar}} sets of management measures are used globally {{to address the}} direct and indirect costs of their practices. Yet {{little is known about}} shrimp fishers' perceptions, despite the clear importance of human behaviour in determining the success of fisheries management. This article presents the results of interviews with industrial <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawl</b> fishers from the southern Gulf of California, Mexico, and reveals fishers' knowledge and attitudes that should be considered when developing management plans for industrial <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries. Fishers were asked to comment on problems facing the fishery, management options to address the issues, {{and the future of the}} fishery in general. The interviews also elicited new knowledge on effort and valuable components of bycatch, useful to the management process. Among the problems facing the Gulf of California fishery, fishers tended to identify those generated externally [...] fluctuations in shrimp populations, increases in fishing effort, decreases in shrimp prices and increasing overheads [...] and thus distance themselves from responsibility for management options. The successes of any mitigation measures for the fishery are likely to depend on proper enforcement and reliable governance, as our study indicates. Should strong enforcement be put in place, then trawl free areas seem to be the most pragmatic way to alleviate problems associated with the fishery; our effort data point to areas that might have greatest acceptance among fishers. A reduction in capacity would clearly complement marine zoning for trawl free areas. In the long run, however, it may be economic extinction of the fishery that reduces pressure on the marine ecosystem.
