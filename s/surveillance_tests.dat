The test is used to estimate IgG antibody levels in oral fluid directed against Bordetella pertussis pertussis toxin (PT). Since 2002 the HPA has been providing a realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) service for infants admitted to hospital (now available for infants aged under 1 year) with suspected pertussis; and sero-diagnosis by detection of raised serum IgG antibodies to pertussis toxin (PT) for patients who have been coughing for two weeks or more [1]. Clinicians who are aware of these methods may still be reluctant to take blood in this patient group, so they may content themselves with notifying the infection but not confirming it by laboratory testing.

40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} potential {{associations between}} fetal <b>surveillance</b> <b>tests</b> and acidosis at birth in pregnancies with abnormal but positive end-diastolic velocity in the umbilical artery. Methods: A prospective case-control study [group 1 : pH = 7. 2] including 46 fetuses with abnormal but positive end-diastolic velocity in the umbilical artery was conducted between February 2007 and March 2009. Outcome variables {{were evaluated by}} univariate analysis and compared between the two groups. Clinically relevant and statistically significant variables were analyzed by logistic regression. Results: Abnormal nonstress test, presence of deceleration, and absent fetal breathing movements were statistically significant. Logistic regression analysis revealed that fetal heart rate (FHR) deceleration in the nonstress test is the only predictor of fetal acidosis at birth (p = 0. 024; OR = 8. 2; 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 52). Conclusions: In fetuses with positive end-diastolic flow velocity, acute variables of the antenatal <b>surveillance</b> <b>tests</b> are correlated with acidosis at birth and FHR deceleration in the nonstress test is the only predictor of fetal acidosis...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPrevention and {{management}} of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is critically important, but clinical practices have historically been heterogeneous. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), {{as part of a}} larger clinical practice guideline initiative, has published evidence-based recommendations, but their effect on clinical practice has not been assessed. A survey was sent to all Canadian HSCT program directors to describe current practices. Current practices were subsequently compared with CDC guideline recommendations and with a Canadian survey published before the CDC guidelines. When current practices did not conform to guideline recommendations, a literature review was performed to determine whether current practices were supported by evidence published after the CDC guidelines. The survey response rate was 100 %. Variability in practices was observed in several aspects of patient care, including (1) indications for CMV-negative blood products, (2) <b>surveillance</b> <b>tests</b> used to detect CMV infection, (3) duration of surveillance testing, (4) duration of maintenance treatment after preemptive therapy was initiated, and (5) treatment of CMV disease. Overall adherence to guideline recommendations was good, especially when they were supported by high-quality data. However, deviations from guideline recommendations were observed: (1) most Canadian allogeneic programs used shorter courses of preemptive therapy; (2) prevention measures aimed at late CMV disease were not systematically applied at most allogeneic programs; and (3) most autologous HSCT programs did not administer preemptive therapy even in high-risk recipients. When deviations occurred, recent evidence supported current practices in some instances (shorter courses of preemptive therapy) but not in others (absence of strategies to prevent late CMV disease). Compared with practices in Canada before publication of the CDC guidelines, a higher proportion of programs used CDC-recommended <b>surveillance</b> <b>tests</b> and treatment for CMV infection. Current practices in Canada remain heterogeneous. Discrepancies between current practices and CDC guideline recommendations occurred in situations either in which practices had changed in response to recently published data or in which evidence supporting a recommendation was poor.

High availability of safety critical systems is very essential to NPP safety, hence, careful analysis {{is required to}} schedule the surveillance activities for such systems in a cost effective way without compromising the plant safety. This forms an optimization problem wherein, two different cases can be formulated for deciding the value of Surveillance Test Interval.

In this Review, we discuss the risks, <b>surveillance</b> <b>tests,</b> and guidelines for the management of extracolonic tumours associated with Lynch syndrome. For all types of extracolonic cancer, evidence supporting surveillance is scarce. A benefit of surveillance is evident only for endometrial cancer, where transvaginal ultrasound and endometrial sampling detect tumours in early stages. Surveillance is generally recommended for urinary tract and gastric cancer, especially in families with more than one member with these types of cancer. For the other types of cancer, surveillance is typically not recommended. Prophylactic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy should be considered for women with Lynch syndrome who are past childbearing age, especially during surgery for colorectal cancer. No data show efficacy of chemopreventive drugs in reducing the risk of extracolonic cancers for patients with Lynch syndrome...|$|E

RAPTOR-M 3 G (RApid Parallel Transport Of Radiation-Multiple 3 D Geometries) which performs full 3 D calculations was developed and is based on domain decomposition algorithms, where the spatial and angular domains are allocated and processed on multi-processor computer architecture.
