40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{accurately}} localize an object, human observers must integrate multiple sensory cues {{related to the}} environment and/or to the body. Such multisensory integration must be repeated over time, so that spatial localization is constantly updated according to environmental changes. In the present experimental study, we examined the multisensory integration processes underlying spatial updating by investigating how gradual modifications of gravitoinertial cues (i. e., somatosensory and vestibular cues) and visual cues affect target localization skills. These were assessed by using a continuous pointing task toward a body-fixed visual target. The ``single'' rotation of the gravitoinertial vector (produced by off-axis centrifugation) resulted in downward pointing errors, which likely were related {{to a combination of}} oculogravic and <b>somatogravic</b> <b>illusions.</b> The ``single'' downward pitch rotation of the visual background produced an elevation of the arm relative to the visual target, suggesting that the rotation of the visual background caused an illusory target elevation (induced-motion phenomenon). Strikingly, the errors observed during the ``combined'' rotation of the visual background and of the gravitoinertial vector appeared as a linear combination of the errors independently observed during ``single'' rotations. In other words, the centrifugation effect on target localization was reduced by the visual background rotation. The observed linear combination indicates that the weights of visual and gravitoinertial cues were similar and remained constant throughout the stimulation...|$|R
50|$|BEA {{then found}} that the crew may have been {{suffering}} a <b>somatogravic</b> <b>illusion</b> in flight. <b>Somatogravic</b> <b>illusion,</b> in aviation, {{is a type of}} optical illusion which can cause the crew to think that they are pitching up, while in reality, they are not. This could happen during night-time flying (causing the crew to lose their visual reference, as it was dark) accompanied by the lack of monitoring of the flight's indicator. <b>Somatogravic</b> <b>illusion</b> was responsible for the crash of Gulf Air Flight 072 in Bahrain. However, the BEA also suspected the specific features of the speed indication on the PFD, especially speed limitations for the Airbus A320 configuration that are shown as the red bars {{at the top of the}} speed indication strip. One of the crew members might have adopted the reflex acquired in training, for example, in response to a TCAS warning when the pilot is anxious to avoid the displayed red part of the instrument scale, which may result in the instinctive forward movement of the side stick, especially when the pilot is in a state of psycho-emotional strain. This version is substantiated by the fact that the pilot was monitoring the flight speed and its limitations (VFE) that depended on the Airbus A320 configuration and retracted the flaps and slats in a timely manner, and the control inputs on the side stick coincided with the moments when the current speed was getting close to the limit value. However, neither of these probable causes have enough evidence.|$|E

40|$|On November 15, 1967, U. S. Air Force {{test pilot}} Major Michael J. Adams was killed while flying the X- 15 rocket-propelled {{research}} vehicle in a parabolic spaceflight profile. This flight {{was part of}} a joint effort with NASA. An electrical short in one of the experiments aboard the vehicle caused electrical transients, resulting in excessive workload by the pilot. At altitude Major Adams inappropriately initiated a flat spin that led to a series of unusual aircraft attitudes upon atmospheric re-entry, ultimately causing structural failure of the airframe. Major Adams was known to experience vertigo (i. e. spatial disorientation) while flying the X- 15, but all X- 15 pilots most likely experienced vertigo (i. e. <b>somatogravic,</b> or "Pitch-Up", <b>illusion)</b> as a normal physiologic response to the accelerative forces involved. Major Adams probably experienced vertigo to a greater degree than did others, since prior aeromedical testing for astronaut selection at Brooks AFB revealed that he had an unusually high degree of labyrinthine sensitivity. Subsequent analysis reveals that after engine burnout, and through the zenith of the flight profile, he likely experienced the oculoagravic ("Elevator") illusion. Nonetheless, painstaking investigation after the mishap revealed that spatial disorientation (Type II, Recognized) was NOT the cause, but rather, a contributing factor. The cause was in fact the misinterpretation of a dual-use flight instrument (i. e. Loss of Mode Awareness), resulting in confusion between yaw and roll indications, with subsequent flight control input that was inappropriate. Because of the altitude achieved on this flight, Major Adams was awarded Astronaut wings posthumously. Understanding the potential for spatial disorientation, particularly the oculoagravic illusion, associated with parabolic spaceflight profiles, and understanding the importance of maintaining mode awareness in the context of automated cockpit design, are two lessons that have direct application to the commercial space industry today...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{investigation}} {{believes the}} PF experienced {{a loss of}} control while initiating a turn to the required departure heading after take-off. Flap retraction and its associated acceleration combined {{to set in motion}} a <b>somatogravic</b> <b>illusion</b> for the PF. The PF’s reaction to pitch down while initiating a turn most likely led to an extreme unusual attitude and the subsequent crash. PM awareness to the imminent loss of control and any attempt to intervene could not be determined. Evidence show that Crew resource management (CRM) performance was insufficient to avoid the crash." ...|$|E
50|$|The crew perhaps wrongly {{perceived}} {{the nature of}} the emergency. Since the explosion of the engine caused the loss of engine thrust, the speed of the plane decreased. This rapid deceleration caused the crew to think that the plane was pitching down, which may explain why the crew made a nose-up input, while in reality, it didn't pitch down. This phenomenon is called as <b>somatogravic</b> <b>illusion.</b> However, instead of fixing the situation, the input that the crew made (the nose-up input) only caused the plane to decelerate even more. The pilot may have suffered spatial disorientation immediately after the emergency.|$|E
50|$|The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) {{have opened}} an {{investigation}} into the accident. AgustaWestland are assisting the AAIB in their enquiries. The aircraft's data recorders were recovered from the wreckage on 15 March. A Special Bulletin published by the AAIB on 4 April revealed that there had been no mechanical failure with the helicopter and that it had not contacted any object between taking off and the crash site. The final report into the accident was originally scheduled to be published around March 2015. It was published on 8 October 2015. The investigation found that there was no mechanical failure with the aircraft. The crew were found not to have used checklists when operating the helicopter. The cause of the accident was pilot error, with spatial disorientation due to <b>somatogravic</b> <b>illusion</b> a major factor.|$|E
40|$|During crewed lunar landings, astronauts are {{expected}} to guide a stable and controlled descent to a landing zone that is level and free of hazards by either making landing point (LP) redesignations or taking direct manual control. However, vestibular and visual sensorimotor limitations unique to lunar landing may interfere with landing performance and safety. Vehicle motion profiles of candidate lunar descent trajectories were used as inputs to a mathematical model for orientation system function, to predict human perception of orientation and identify disorientating illusions. Simulations were conducted using the vestibular-only portion of the model as well as incorporating the activation of visual cues. Dust blowback from the descent engine was modeled as well. The NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator was used to experimentally investigate human orientation perception during manually controlled landing trajectories. Subjects were tasked with reporting perceptions of vehicle tilt angle and horizontal velocity. There were three treatment conditions studied: eyes closed (blindfolded), eyes out the window on simulated lunar terrain, or eyes on display instruments. It {{was seen in the}} vestibular-only orientation perception model that the acceleration profile of the descent engine throughout candidate trajectories is likely to create a <b>somatogravic</b> <b>illusion.</b> This illusion creates the perception of being upright even when the actual vehicle orientation is significantly tilted. The model predicts the underestimation of tilt angle for the candidate automated trajectories as well during maneuvers resulting from LP redesignation and manual control maneuvers. The activation of visual pathways in the model improved orientation perceptions, however misperceptions persisted when visual cues were limited such as prior to the pitch-over maneuver and during dust blowback. Results from the motion base simulator experiment are in agreement with the likelihood of the <b>somatogravic</b> <b>illusion</b> occurring without the astronauts' continued focus on instrument displays. Horizontal velocity was poorly perceived without reliable visual cues, both in magnitude and direction. Misperception of spatial orientation is likely to increase workload and may reduce performance and safety during landing. Countermeasures should be designed to minimize the risk of astronaut disorientation, including the design of advanced displays. by Torin Kristofer Clark. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Quantitative "observer" {{models for}} spatial {{orientation}} and eye movements {{have been developed}} based on 1 -G data from humans and animals (e. g. Oman 1982, 1991, Merfeld, et al 1993, 2002; Haslwanter 2000, Vingerhoets 2006). These models assume that the CNS estimates "down", head angular velocity and linear acceleration utilizing an internal model for gravity and sense organ dynamics, continuously updated by sensory-conflict signals. CNS function is thus analogous to a Luenberger state observer in engineering systems. Using a relatively small set of free parameters, Observer orientation models capture the main features of experimental data {{for a variety of}} different motion stimuli. We developed a Matlab/Simulink based Observer model, including Excel spreadsheet input capability and a GUI to make the model accessible to less expert Matlab users. Orientation and motion predictions can be plotted in 2 D or visualized in 3 D using virtual avatars. Our Observer's internal model now computes azimuth, and pseudointegrates linear motion in an allocentric reference frame (perceived north-east-down). The model mimics the large perceptual errors for vertical motion observed experimentally. It retains the well validated "vestibular core" of the Merfeld perceptual model and predicts responses to angular velocity and linear accelerations steps, dumping, fixed radius centrifugation, roll tilt and OVAR. This model was further extended to include static and dynamic visual sensory information from four independent visual sensors (Visual Velocity, Position, Angular Velocity and Gravity/"Down"). (cont.) Visual additions were validated against the Borah et al (1978) Kalman filter simulation results and validation data sets (Earth vertical constant velocity rotation in the light, <b>somatogravic</b> <b>illusion</b> in the light, and linear and circular vection). The model predicts that circular vection should have two dynamic components, and the recent finding of Tokumaru et al (1998) that visual cues influence <b>somatogravic</b> <b>illusion</b> in ways not accounted for by the Borah model. The model also correctly predicts both the direction of Coriolis illusion, and the magnitude of the resulting tilt illusion. It also predicts that the direction and mechanism of Pseudo-Coriolis illusion is fundamentally different from Coriolis, a prediction verified by means of a pilot experiment. Finally, the model accounts for the dynamics of astronaut post-flight tilt-gain and OTTR vertigos in ways not explained by previous static analyses (e. g. Merfeld, 2003).

40|$|Perception of tilt (<b>somatogravic</b> <b>illusion)</b> in {{response}} to sustained linear acceleration is generally attributed to the otolithic system which reflects either a translation of the head or a reorientation of the head with respect to gravity (tilt/translation ambiguity). The main {{aim of this study}} was to compare the tilt perception during prolonged static tilt and translation between 8 and 20 degrees of tilt relative to the gravitoinertial forces (i. e., G and GIF, respectively) when the semicircular cues were no more available. An indirect measure of tilt perception was estimated by means of a visual and kinesthetic judgment of the gravitational horizon. The main results contrast with the interpretation regarding the tilt/translation ambiguity as the same orientation relative to the shear forces G for the true tilt or GIF in the centrifuge did not induce the same horizon perception. Visual adjustment and arm pointing in the centrifuge were always above the ones observed in a G environment. Part of the lowering of the judgment in the centrifuge may be related to the mechanical effect of GIF on the effectors as shown by the shift of the egocentric coordinates in the direction of GIF. The role of the extravestibular graviceptors in the judgment of the degree of tilt of one's own body relative to G or GIF was discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{otoliths}} are stimulated in {{the same}} fashion by gravitational and inertial forces, so otolith signals are ambiguous indicators of self-orientation. The ambiguity can be resolved with added visual information indicating orientation and acceleration with respect to the earth. Here we present a Bayesian model of the statistically optimal combination of noisy vestibular and visual signals. Likelihoods associated with sensory measurements are represented in an orientation/acceleration space. The likelihood function associated with the otolith signal illustrates the ambiguity; there is no unique solution for self-orientation or acceleration. Likelihood functions associated with other sensory signals can resolve this ambiguity. In addition, we propose two priors, each acting on a dimension in the orientation/acceleration space: the idiotropic prior and the no-acceleration prior. We conducted experiments using a motion platform and attached visual display to examine the influence of visual signals on the interpret ation of the otolith signal. Subjects made pitch and acceleration judgments as the vestibular and visual signals were manipulated independently. Predictions of the model were confirmed: (1) visual signals affected the interpretation of the otolith signal, (2) less variable signals had more influence on perceived orientation and acceleration than more variable ones, and (3) combined estimates were more precise than single-cue estimates. We also show that the model can explain some well-known phenomena including the perception of upright in zero gravity, the Aubert effect, and the <b>somatogravic</b> <b>illusion...</b>|$|E
40|$|Crewed lunar {{landings}} require astronauts {{to interact}} with automated systems to identify a location that is level and free of hazards and to guide the vehicle to the lunar surface through a controlled descent. However, vestibular limitations resulting from exposure to lunar gravity after short-term adaptation to weightlessness, combined with acceleration profiles unique to lunar landing trajectories may result in astronaut spatial disorientation. A quantitative mathematical model of human spatial orientation previously developed was adopted to analyze disorientation concerns during lunar landing conditions that cannot be reproduced experimentally. Vehicle acceleration and rotation rate profiles of lunar landing descent trajectories were compiled and entered as inputs to the orientation model to predict astronaut perceived orientations. Both fully automated trajectories and trajectories with pilot interaction were studied. The latter included both simulated landing point redesignation and direct manual control. The lunar descent trajectories contain acceleration and rotation rate profiles producing attitude perceptions that differ substantially from the actual vehicle state. In particular, a <b>somatogravic</b> <b>illusion</b> is predicted that causes the perceived orientation to be nearly upright compared to the actual vehicle state which is pitched back. Furthermore, astronaut head location within the vehicle is considered for different vehicle designs {{to determine the effect}} on perceived orientation. The effect was found to be small, but measureable (0. 3 - 4. 1 degrees), and larger for the new Altair vehicle design compared to the Apollo Lunar Module.

40|$|Pilot spatial {{disorientation}} (SD) {{is a significant}} cause of incidents and fatal accidents in aviation. The pilot is susceptible to SD especially in low visibility when the visual system is deprived of information from outside the cockpit. This thesis presents the notion of visual flow displays as enhancement of symbology on flight displays primarily in low visibility for improved support of the pilot’s spatial orientation (SO) and control actions. In Studies I and II, synthetic visual flow of forward ego-motion was presented on displays and postural responses were used as measures of display effectiveness in determining SO. The visual flow significantly affected SO, and although the increased stimulation of the visual periphery from a width of 45 ° to about 105 ° increased the effects there was no further effect at a width of about 150 ° (Studies I and II). Studies I and II also showed that omitting 20 °- or 30 °-wide central fields of view from the visual flow either reduced or not reduced the effects. Further, although inconclusive, Study II may indicate that horizon symbology in central visual field may enhance the effects of peripheral visual flow.  The appropriate integration of peripheral visual flow with the head-up display symbology of the Gripen aircraft was presented. Acceleration in a human centrifuge was used in Study III to investigate the effects of synthetic visual flow on the primarily vestibular-dependent <b>somatogravic</b> <b>illusion</b> of pitch-up. Two experiments revealed a reduced illusion with the visual flow. The results of Experiment 2 showed the visual flow scene not only reduced the illusion compared with a darkness condition but also compared with the visual scene without visual flow. Thus, similar to the main findings of Studies I and II, synthetic visual flow can significantly affect SO and supports the visually dependent SO system in an essential manner...|$|E
