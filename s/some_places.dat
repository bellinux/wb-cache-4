5|$|An {{anonymous}} chronicler at Bury St Edmunds, {{working in}} the second quarter of the 12th century, produced a compilation now known as The Annals of St Neots. He used material from a version of Asser's work which differs in <b>some</b> <b>places</b> from the Cotton manuscript and in <b>some</b> <b>places</b> appears to be more accurate, so it is possible that the copy used was not the Cotton manuscript.|$|E
5|$|A more ancient {{dwelling}} on Shapinsay is the Iron Age Broch of Burroughston. Only {{the interior of}} this partially buried building has been excavated, allowing visitors to look down into the broch from the surrounding mound. The surviving drystone walls rise to about threemetres (10ft) and are more than fourmetres (13ft) thick in <b>some</b> <b>places.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Honda {{released}} restyled {{versions of}} the Cubs on some markets, with square lamps and plastic-covered handlebars and rear mudguard. On the domestic Japanese market the square style was optional, but in <b>some</b> <b>places</b> such as the UK they replaced imports of the traditionally styled round lamp Cub.|$|E

5|$|Releases {{are named}} by year but have {{internal}} version numbers as well. The internal version number was advanced to 15.x in the 2008 edition {{to match the}} Norton AntiVirus release of the same year.

The office of the state Congress spokesperson Sanjay Nirupam was also vandalised.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Scheer and Admiral Graf Spee {{had some}} {{improvements}} in armor thickness. The barbettes, 100mm thick in Deutschland, became 125mm {{for the two}} sisters. Admiral Scheer had the belt somewhat improved, and Admiral Graf Spee had a much more improved 100mm belt, instead of 50–80mm. The armored deck was improved as well, and <b>some</b> <b>places</b> had up to 70mm thickness.|$|E

5|$|Autumn {{arrives in}} March and brings periods of very rainy weather {{followed}} by dry, mild stretches and cool nights. <b>Some</b> <b>places</b> {{in the east}} receive rainfall throughout autumn whereas in the west, after the rains, the weather quickly becomes very dry. Generally, frost arrives in early April in the southernmost areas, in late May in the north, and ends by mid-September, although the dates {{of the first and}} last frosts can vary from year to year. Frost is rarely intense or prolonged and may not occur each year.|$|E
5|$|Before {{developing}} the route west of Aspen, the state turned its attention the other way. In 1927 it rebuilt the old stage road over Independence Pass to Twin Lakes and designated {{it part of}} Highway 82, closing it in winters to avoid the maintenance costs. Most of it followed the original route; however in <b>some</b> <b>places</b> it deviated. The largest section of the original remains three miles (5km) below the pass on the east approach. The foundation of the gatekeeper's house remains, {{as well as some}} of the original toll gate.|$|E
5|$|Brenda {{made two}} landfalls in Mexico: {{first in the}} Yucatan and later in Campeche. Little damage {{resulted}} from the storm throughout the Yucatan Peninsula. However, severe damage took place in areas near Brenda's second landfall. A total of 10 people {{were killed by the}} hurricane and over 2,000 more were left homeless. Flooding caused by Brenda was considered to be the worst in over 25 years in <b>some</b> <b>places.</b>|$|E

5|$|In June 2016, the {{estimated}} cost of the one-stop SSE was revised from $2 billion to $2.9 billion because tunnels need to be deeper than expected in <b>some</b> <b>places,</b> with the new terminal station being 45 to 90 per cent deeper. An additional cost factor is that a high water table would require more concrete. There is also a $300 million maintenance cost to keep Line 3 Scarborough operating until the SSE's opening {{resulting in a total}} project cost of $3.2 billion.|$|E
5|$|In some areas, {{introduced}} {{black and}} brown rats raid nests for eggs and young. Cats also threaten the red-billed tropicbird.

5|$|Just {{after its}} {{intersection}} with the PIP, the road intersects two former Rockland County Routes (CR106A & CR69). Also, {{at this point}} CR106 enters the village limits of Stony Point, and becomes a , highway with extra lanes in <b>some</b> <b>places.</b> The highway intersects CR108, CR47, and CR33 as Central Drive. CR106 {{comes to an end}} shortly after these intersections at US9W and US202 in downtown Stony Point, about a mile west from the Hudson River and the Stony Point Marina.|$|E
5|$|Later in 2009, Goodman {{and colleagues}} {{described}} two more species of M.manavi-like Malagasy Miniopterus: M.brachytragos from northern Madagascar and M.mahafaliensis from the southwest. On {{the basis of}} cytochrome b sequences, they found that M.aelleni was most closely related to a clade of M.brachytragos, M.manavi, and another recently described Malagasy species, M.petersoni. The five recognized species of M.manavi-like bats are not each other's closest relatives, but apparently acquired their similarities through convergent evolution. At <b>some</b> <b>places</b> (for example, Namoroka) four cryptic species of M.manavi-like bats, including M.aelleni, occur together.|$|E
