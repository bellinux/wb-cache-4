40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{evolution}} of technology, global warming induced by greenhouse gases {{and the economic}} crisis have prompted public administrators, professionals {{in the construction industry}} and even individuals to implement actions aimed at saving energy, in terms of either reducing the energy demand of buildings or increasing the use of renewable sources. In order to limit the energy needs for winter heating, attention at the legislative level has recently focused on the reduction of heat loss and a more efficient use of solar gains. The latter approach can be pursued not only by means of active solar systems, but also through passive systems such as attached solar <b>sunspaces,</b> which essentially reduce the temperature gradient and the heat loss through the outer walls. In this work, the performance of <b>sunspaces</b> applied to common architectural elements of Italian buildings such as small balconies is theoretically investigated on the basis of standard procedures for assessment of energy performance, in order to highlight their potential when applied to the energy refurbishment of existing buildings...|$|R
5000|$|The {{temperature}} variations {{caused by}} the heat losses and gains can be moderated by thermal mass and low-emissivity windows. Thermal mass can include a masonry floor, a masonry wall bordering the house, or water containers. Distribution of heat to the building can be accomplished through ceiling and floor level vents, windows, doors, or fans. In a common design, thermal mass wall situated {{on the back of}} the <b>sunspace</b> adjacent to the living space will function like an indirect-gain thermal mass wall. Solar energy entering the <b>sunspace</b> is retained in the thermal mass. Solar heat is conveyed into the building by conduction through the shared mass wall in the rear of the <b>sunspace</b> and by vents (like an unvented thermal storage wall) or through openings in the wall that permit airflow from the <b>sunspace</b> to the indoor space by convection (like a vented thermal storage wall).|$|E
50|$|A <b>sunspace</b> with a masonry thermal wall {{will need}} {{approximately}} 0.3 ft2 of thermal mass wall surface per ft2 of floor area being heated (0.3 m2 per m2 of floor area), depending on climate. Wall thicknesses should {{be similar to}} a thermal storage wall. If a water wall is used between the <b>sunspace</b> and living space, about 0.20 ft2 of thermal mass wall surface per ft2 of floor area being heated (0.2 m2 per m2 of floor area) is appropriate. In most climates, a ventilation system is required in summer months to prevent overheating. Generally, vast overhead (horizontal) and east- and west-facing glass areas {{should not be used}} in a <b>sunspace</b> without special precautions for summer overheating such as using heat-reflecting glass and providing summer-shading systems areas.|$|E
50|$|An {{attached}} <b>sunspace,</b> {{also sometimes}} called a solar room or solarium, {{is a type}} of isolated gain solar system with a glazed interior space or room that is part of or attached to a building but which can be completely closed off from the main occupied areas. It functions like an attached greenhouse that makes use of a combination of direct-gain and indirect-gain system characteristics. A <b>sunspace</b> may be called and appear like a greenhouse, but a greenhouse is designed to grow plants whereas a <b>sunspace</b> is designed to provide heat and aesthetics to a building. Sunspaces are very popular passive design elements because they expand the living areas of a building and offer a room to grow plants and other vegetation. In moderate and cold climates, however, supplemental space heating is required to keep plants from freezing during extremely cold weather.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} {{analyzes}} the compatibility of the simplified empirical method {{based on the}} dimensionless parameter of Solar Load Ratio (SLR) and the monthly procedure of the standard ISO 13790 for indirect gains, specifically for unconditioned zones adjacent to a conditioned zone, but separated from it by a partition wall (<b>sunspaces).</b> The main contribution of the work presented here is the new formulation to account SLR correlations in ISO 13790, obtained for <b>sunspaces,</b> but generalizable for other solar systems with known SLR functions. Simulation models are used to perform a sensitivity analysis of internal gains and heat transfer through solar collector surfaces, both issues that distinguishes ISO 13790 from Load Ratio methods. The analysis shows that internal gains {{can be added to}} the heat source term or subtracted to heat transfer term without influencing the utilization factor dependence with the gain-to-loss ratio. On the other hand, the SLR assumption that solar collector surfaces are neutral elements and, therefore, not added to the heat transfer term, results in large inconsistencies between SLR and ISO 13790 methods. The detailed monthly methodology of ISO 13790 fairly reproduces results obtained by simulation. However, predictions from the simplified monthly methodology of ISO 13790 fail in mid season months and coldest months...|$|R
40|$|Passive solar {{elements}} for both {{direct and indirect}} gains, are systems used to maintain a comfortable living environment while saving energy, especially in the building energy retrofit and adaptation process. <b>Sunspaces,</b> thermal mass and glazing area and orientation have been often {{used in the past}} to guarantee adequate indoor conditions when mechanical devices were not available. After a period of neglect, nowadays they are again considered as appropriate systems to help face environmental issues in the building sector, and both international and national legislation takes into consideration the possibility of including them in the building planning tools, also providing economic incentives. Their proper design needs dynamic simulation, often difficult to perform and time consuming. Moreover, results generally suffer from several uncertainties, so quasi steady-state procedures are often used in everyday practice with good results, but some corrections are still needed. In this paper, a comparative analysis of different solutions for the construction of verandas in an existing building is presented, following the procedure provided by the slightly modified and improved Standard EN ISO 13790 : 2008. Advantages and disadvantages of different configurations considering thermal insulation, windows typology and mechanical ventilation systems are discussed and a general intervention strategy is proposed. The aim is to highlight the possibility of using <b>sunspaces</b> in order to increase the efficiency of the existing building stock, considering ease of construction and economic viability.

40|$|Humla Province is {{a remote}} mountainous region of {{northwest}} Nepal. The climate is harsh {{and the local}} people are extremely poor. Most people endure a subsistence culture, living in traditional housing. Energy for cooking and heating comes from fuelwood, supplies of which are diminishing. In order to improve the indoor environment and reduce fuelwood use, smokeless stoves are being introduced to replace the open fire in Humli homes. There is some concern, however, that comfort levels {{may not be as}} acceptable with these stoves. The aim of this research was therefore to investigate ways in which the comfort levels in traditional Humli housing might be improved using simple and low cost strategies. Temperature data was recorded in four rooms of a traditional Humli home over a 12 -day period and used with fuelwood data to validate a TRNSYS simulation model of the house. This model was then used to evaluate the impact on comfort levels in the house of various energy conservation strategies using PMV and PPD indicators. As a single strategy, it was found that reducing infiltration of outside air was likely to be more effective than increasing the insulation level in the ceilings. The most successful strategy, however, was the creation of <b>sunspaces</b> at the entrances to the living rooms. This strategy increased average internal temperatures by 1. 7 and 2. 3 °C.

40|$|Interest in {{reducing}} energy use in buildings {{began in the}} U. S. in the 1930 ’s with work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on solar heated structures. With the energy crises in the 1970 s, {{efforts were made to}} reduce energy use in U. S. homes. Passive solar design involved insulated south oriented glazing systems, Trombe walls, <b>sunspaces,</b> flat plate collectors; thermal mass and optimally designed overhangs. It was discovered that by reducing building cooling and heating needs through energy conservation while implementing passive solar strategies the lowest energy use at a lower incremental cost could be achieved. Super-insulated homes were successful at minimizing heat loss and gain and the subsequent load on mechanical systems, but interest subsided as energy prices dropped in the 1980 s. The passive solar homes and super-insulation movements, addressed passive heating and cooling, but other home energy end uses were not addressed. Throughout the late 1980 s, the cost of solid state solar electricity production with photovoltaic cells declined and become affordable for individual house distributed generation.

40|$|Several new {{technologies}} can be today implemented in buildings {{in order to}} achieve a NZEB. In this paper a novel computer model for predicting the energy demand of buildings integrating phase change materials, photovoltaic-thermal collectors, adjacent <b>sunspaces</b> and innovative daylighting control is presented. Through this tool, written in MatLab and conceived for research aims, the overall energy and economic performance of multi-zone NZEBs can be assessed. Both the active and passive influences of all the above mentioned technologies (even when simultaneously utilised) are taken into account since in the code they are modelled as building integrated.

50|$|The U.S. DOE {{explains}} drawbacks to roof-angled glazing: Glass {{and plastic}} have little structural strength. When installed vertically, glass (or plastic) bears {{its own weight}} because only a small area (the top edge of the glazing) is subject to gravity. As the glass tilts off the vertical axis, however, an increased area (now the sloped cross-section) of the glazing has to bear the force of gravity. Glass is also brittle; it does not flex much before breaking. To counteract this, you usually must increase {{the thickness of the}} glazing or increase the number of structural supports to hold the glazing.

50|$|An {{attached}} sunspace’s south-facing glass collects {{solar energy}} as in a direct-gain system. The simplest <b>sunspace</b> design is to install vertical windows with no overhead glazing. Sunspaces may experience high heat gain and high heat loss through their abundance of glazing. Although horizontal and sloped glazing collects more {{heat in the}} winter, it is minimized to prevent overheating during summer months. Although overhead glazing can be aesthetically pleasing, an insulated roof provides better thermal performance. Skylights {{can be used to}} provide some daylighting potential. Vertical glazing can maximize gain in winter, when the angle of the sun is low, and yield less heat gain during the summer. Vertical glass is less expensive, easier to install and insulate, and not as prone to leaking, fogging, breaking, and other glass failures. A combination of vertical glazing and some sloped glazing is acceptable if summer shading is provided. A well-designed overhang may be all that is necessary to shade the glazing in the summer.|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the overall performance of a green building is complex, since many construction, energy and environmental aspects have to be considered.

The first part of the research focuses on a state of art on housing projects realized in different countries. A critical review of these buildings leads to highlight the best technical and functional characteristics for each one with the aim to define a new proposal.

40|$|The study aims {{to inform}} {{designers}} about {{a method for}} assessing the likely energy consequences of decisions open to them regarding refurbishment options for high-rise housing in the UK. The TASÂ° thermal simulation computer program was used to predict the effects of various improvement measures for a first-floor and a tenth-floor flat. The performances of retrofitted thermal insulation, double glazing, ventilation control measures, and <b>sunspaces</b> were considered. A lifecycle costing method was used to indicate the energy and financial benefits of these improvement options. The results {{indicated that there was}} a difference of between 25 % and 60 % in the predicted heating loads of the first-floor and tenth-floor flats, depending on the improvements installed. Ventilation control measures were found to be the most effective in reducing heating loads and to have progressively greater significance the higher up the building the flat is located. Conversely, wall insulation measures were shown to be the least effective in view of the relatively high percentage of glazing within the external wall areas. The predictions indicated that the provision of sun-spaces could not be recommended solely on energy-thrift grounds, because of their high capital costs and low energy savings, but other improvements could be justified over the lifetime simply by taking account of the cost benefit of predicted energy savings. The interaction of the effects of various renovation measures was also considered.
