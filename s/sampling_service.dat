40|$|Abstract. The peer <b>sampling</b> <b>service</b> is a {{middleware}} {{service that}} provides random samples {{from a large}} decentralized network to support gossip-based applications such as multicast, data aggregation and overlay topology management. Lightweight gossip-based implementations of the peer <b>sampling</b> <b>service</b> {{have been shown to}} provide good quality random sampling while also being extremely robust to many failure scenarios, including node churn and catastrophic failure. We identify two problems with these approaches. The first problem is related to message drop failures: if a node experiences a higher-than-average message drop rate then the probability of sampling this node in the network will decrease. The second problem is that the application layer at different nodes might request random samples at very different rates which can result in very poor random sampling especially at nodes with high request rates. We propose solutions for both problems. We focus on Newscast, a robust implementation of the peer <b>sampling</b> <b>service.</b> Our solution is based on simple extensions of the protocol and an adaptive self-control mechanism for its parameters, namely—without involving failure detectors—nodes passively monitor local protocol events using them as feedback for a local control loop for self-tuning the protocol parameters. The proposed solution is evaluated by simulation experiments. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, the gossip-based {{communication}} {{model in}} large-scale distributed systems {{has become a}} general paradigm with im-portant applications which include information dissemination, aggrega-tion, overlay topology management and synchronization. At the heart {{of all of these}} protocols lies a fundamental distributed abstraction: the peer <b>sampling</b> <b>service.</b> In short, the aim of this service is to provide every node with peers to exchange information with. Analytical studies reveal a high reliability and efficiency of gossip-based protocols, under the (of-ten implicit) assumption that the peers to send gossip messages to are selected uniformly at random from the set of all nodes. In practice – instead of requiring all nodes to know all the peer nodes so that a ran-dom sample could be drawn – a scalable and efficient way to implement the peer <b>sampling</b> <b>service</b> is by constructing and maintaining dynamic unstructured overlays through gossiping membership information itself.

40|$|Gossiping {{protocols}} {{have proven}} to be valuable components to build higher level services and applications. Many of them rely on a common feature; the ability to exchange information with a neighbor randomly selected from the current node population. This feature is provided by what is named a “peer <b>sampling</b> <b>service.</b> ” Its principle relies on providing each node with references to a small subset of the current node population, called a partial view, and exchanging elements from these views through gossiping. Views are updated as part of the gossiping {{in such a way that}} they form a random sample of all nodes. Although maintaining this randomness is relatively easy and highly independent of the actual gossiping protocol, the situation changes dramatically when malicious peers come into play. In this paper, we present a general attack model by which a handful of nodes can swiftly disrupt even very large gossiping networks. Our solution is essentially based on detecting anomalies, leading to a “secure peer <b>sampling</b> <b>service.</b> ” However, as we show, the speed by which attackers can operate requires special measures to detect the process of disruption in a timely manner...|$|E

40|$|International audienceGossip-based peer {{sampling}} protocols {{have been widely}} used as a building block for many large-scale distributed applications. However, Network Address Translation gateways (NATs) cause most existing gossiping protocols to break down, as nodes cannot establish direct connections to nodes behind NATs (private nodes). In addition, most of the existing NAT traversal algorithms for establishing connectivity to private nodes rely on third party servers running at a well-known, public IP addresses. In this paper, we present Gozar, a gossip-based peer <b>sampling</b> <b>service</b> that: (i) provides uniform random samples in the presence of NATs, and (ii) enables direct connectivity to sampled nodes using a fully distributed NAT traversal service, where connection messages require only a single hop to connect to private nodes.

For example, if 80 % of nodes are behind NATs, and 80 % of the nodes fail, more than 92 % of the remaining nodes stay connected. In addition, we compare Gozar with existing NAT-friendly gossip-based peer sampling services, Nylon and ARRG. We show that Gozar is the only system that supports one-hop NAT traversal, and its overhead is roughly half of Nylon’s...|$|E

Nevertheless, most validation in this area has been empirical so far {{and there is a}} lack of a theoretical counterpart to characterize what can and cannot be computed with gossip protocols. Population protocols, on the other hand, benefit from a sound theoretical framework but little empirical evaluation. In this paper, we establish a correlation between population and gossip-based protocols. We propose a classification of gossip-based protocols, based on the nature of the underlying peer <b>sampling</b> <b>service.</b> First, we show that the class of gossip protocols, where each node relies on an arbitrary sample, is equivalent to population protocols. Second, we show that gossip-based protocols, relying on a more powerful peer <b>sampling</b> <b>service</b> providing peers using a clearly identified set of other peers, are equivalent to community protocols, a modern variant of population protocols. Leveraging the resemblances between population and gossip protocols enables to provide a theoretical framework for distributed systems where global behaviors emerge from a set of local interactions, both in wired and wireless settings. The practical validations of gossip-protocols provide empirical evidence of quick convergence times of such algorithms and demonstrate their practical relevance. While existing results in each area can be immediately applied, this also leaves the space to transfer any new results, practical or theoretical, from one domain to the other. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDistributed Hash Tables (DHTs) and Random Peer Sampling (RPS) provide {{important}} and complementary {{services in the}} area of P 2 P overlay networks. DHTs achieve efficient lookup while RPS enables nodes to build and maintain connectivity in the presence of high churn. Clearly, many applications, e. g. {{in the area of}} search, would greatly benefit if both these services were available together at a reasonable cost. This paper integrates a structured P 2 P overlay and a Random Peer <b>Sampling</b> <b>service</b> through gossip protocols. This system called D 2 HT, leverages the small-world nature of DHTs and relies on two cohabiting gossip protocols maintaining the close and long-range links respectively. The long links are chosen according to a harmonic distribution, following the Kleinberg small-world model. This approach exhibits several benefits: (i) The resulting DHT is highly dynamic and self-stabilizing, changes are tracked for free through the gossip nature of the protocol. This removes the need for complex, usually disjoint, and expensive join and repair procedures. Yet, it achieves reasonable routing performance with respect to standard DHTs; (ii) The resulting peer <b>sampling</b> <b>service</b> provides a biased sampling following a harmonic distribution: this improves the routing without jeopardizing the quality of the RPS. The set of long-range links which are a source of RPS can be used independently by others applications for free. They change continuously, achieving well-balanced routing across the nodes. We perform extensive simulations and compare the performances of D 2 HT with Cyclon, HRing, Symphony and Pastry to demonstrate the gains achieved by the approach proposed in this paper...|$|E
