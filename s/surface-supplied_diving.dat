5|$|Keeping this in mind, it is {{not hard}} to see why {{technical}} divers who do long deep dives require multiple cylinders or rebreathers, and commercial divers normally use <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving</b> equipment, and only carry scuba as an emergency gas supply.|$|E
5|$|A diving {{cylinder}}, scuba tank or {{diving tank}} is a gas cylinder used to store and transport the high pressure breathing gas required by a scuba set. It {{may also be}} used for <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving</b> or as decompression gas or an emergency gas supply for surface supplied diving or scuba. Cylinders provide gas to the diver through the demand valve of a diving regulator or the breathing loop of a diving rebreather.|$|E
5|$|Compressor diving is a {{rudimentary}} method of <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving</b> {{used in some}} tropical regions such as the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure air compressor on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or mouthpiece and allows excess air to spill out between the lips.|$|E
2500|$|Repetitive dives {{should be}} {{conducted}} {{in the same manner}} as other dives including [...] "Cross Corrections" [...] for altitude. The US Navy does not allow repetitive <b>diving</b> for <b>surface-supplied</b> helium-oxygen <b>diving</b> and a 12-hour surface interval is required. An 18-hour surface interval is required if the dive requires decompression.|$|R
5|$|In ambient {{pressure}} diving, the diver is directly {{exposed to the}} pressure of the surrounding water. The {{ambient pressure}} diver may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for scuba diving or <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving,</b> and the saturation diving technique reduces the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. Atmospheric diving suits (ADS) may be used to isolate the diver from high ambient pressure. Crewed submersibles can extend depth range, and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.|$|E
5|$|Professional divers may be {{required}} by legislation or industry codes of practice to carry sufficient reserve gas {{to enable them to}} reach a place of safety, such as the surface, or a diving bell, based on the planned dive profile. This reserve gas is usually required to be carried as an independent emergency gas supply (EGS), also known as a bailout cylinder, set or bottle. This usually also applies to professional divers using <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving</b> equipment.|$|E
25|$|In <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving,</b> and {{particularly}} in saturation diving, the loss of weights followed by positive buoyancy can expose the diver to potentially fatal decompression injury. Consequently, weight systems for <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving</b> where the diver is transported to the worksite by a diving bell or stage, are usually not provided with a quick-release system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Surface-supplied</b> <b>diving</b> {{equipment}} usually includes communication capability {{with the}} surface, which {{adds to the}} safety and efficiency of the working diver.|$|E
25|$|Scuba, {{which is}} {{commonly}} used in recreational diving, is the main alternative to <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving</b> equipment. Scuba is available in open circuit and rebreather configurations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Surface-supplied</b> <b>diving</b> {{equipment}} {{is required for}} {{a large proportion of}} the commercial diving operations conducted in many countries, either by direct legislation, or by authorised codes of practice, as in the case of IMCA operations.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{large number}} of {{standard}} procedures associated with <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving.</b> Some of these have their equivalents in scuba, and others are very different. Details will vary depending on the equipment used, as manufacturers will specify some checks and procedures in detail, and the order may vary to some extent.|$|E
25|$|Scuba diving may be done recreationally or professionally in {{a number}} of applications, {{including}} scientific, military and public safety roles, but most commercial diving uses <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving</b> equipment when this is practicable. Scuba divers engaged in armed forces covert operations may be referred to as frogmen, combat divers or attack swimmers.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice between}} scuba and <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving</b> {{equipment}} {{is based on}} both legal and logistical constraints. Where the diver requires mobility and a large range of movement, scuba is usually the choice if safety and legal constraints allow. Higher risk work, particularly in commercial diving, may be restricted to surface-supplied equipment by legislation and codes of practice.|$|E
25|$|A {{low-pressure}} compressor {{is often}} the air supply of choice for <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving,</b> as it is virtually unlimited {{in the amount of}} air it can supply, provided the delivery volume and pressure are adequate for the application. A low-pressure compressor can run for tens of hours, needing only refueling, periodical filter drainage and occasional running checks, and is therefore more convenient than high-pressure storage cylinders for primary air supply.|$|E
25|$|<b>Surface-supplied</b> <b>diving</b> {{equipment}} and techniques are mainly used in professional diving or military diving {{due to the}} greater cost and complexity of owning and operating the equipment. This type of equipment is used in saturation diving, as the gas supply is relatively secure, and the diver can not bail out to the surface, and for diving in contaminated water, where the diver must be protected from the environment, and helmets are generally used for environmental isolation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Surface-supplied</b> <b>diving</b> is diving using {{equipment}} {{supplied with}} breathing gas using a diver's umbilical from the surface, {{either from the}} shore or from a diving support vessel, sometimes indirectly via a diving bell. This is different from scuba diving, where the diver's breathing equipment is completely self-contained {{and there is no}} link to the surface. The primary advantages of conventional surface supplied diving are lower risk of drowning and considerably larger breathing gas supply than scuba, allowing longer working periods and safer decompression.|$|E
25|$|Compressor diving is {{a method}} of <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving</b> used in some {{tropical}} sea areas including the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask covering the eyes-and-nose and (often home-made) fins and are supplied air from the boat by plastic hoses from an industrial low-pressure air compressor of the type commonly used to supply jackhammers. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or mouthpiece. Excess air spills out through the lips.|$|E
25|$|Nitrox {{is used to}} {{a lesser}} extent in <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving,</b> as these {{advantages}} are reduced by the more complex logistical requirements for nitrox compared to the use of simple low-pressure compressors for breathing gas supply. Nitrox can also be used in hyperbaric treatment of decompression illness, usually at pressures where pure oxygen would be hazardous. Nitrox is not a safer gas than compressed air in all respects; although its use can reduce the risk of decompression sickness, it increases the risk of oxygen toxicity and fire.|$|E
25|$|Their {{field of}} {{application}} {{is very different from}} full <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving.</b> Hookah is generally used for shallow water work in low-hazard applications, such as archaeology, aquaculture, and aquarium maintenance work, but is also sometimes used for open water hunting and gathering of seafood, shallow water mining of gold and diamonds in rivers and streams, and bottom cleaning and other underwater maintenance of boats. Sasuba and Snuba are mainly a shallow water recreational application for low-hazard sites. Sasuba Hookah diving equipment is also used for yacht or boat maintenance and hull cleaning, swimming pool maintenance, shallow underwater inspections.|$|E
25|$|Diving with a {{self-contained}} underwater breathing apparatus, which is completely independent of surface supply, provides the diver with {{the advantages of}} mobility and horizontal range far beyond what is possible when supplied from the surface by the umbilical hoses of <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving</b> equipment. Scuba has limitations of breathing gas supply, communications between diver and surface are problematic, {{the location of the}} diver may be difficult to monitor, and it is considered a higher-risk mode of diving in most circumstances. Scuba is specifically forbidden for some professional applications. Decompression is often avoided, and if necessary, is generally in-water, but may use a variety of gases.|$|E
25|$|A diving {{regulator}} is {{a pressure}} regulator that reduces pressurized breathing gas to ambient pressure and delivers {{it to the}} diver. The gas may be air or one {{of a variety of}} specially blended breathing gases. The gas may be supplied from a scuba cylinder carried by the diver or via a hose from a compressor or high pressure storage cylinders at the surface in <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving.</b> A gas pressure regulator has one or more valves in series which reduce pressure from the source, and use the downstream pressure as feedback to control the rate of flow and thereby the delivered pressure, lowering the pressure at each stage.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to a low-pressure compressor for gas supply is high-pressure storage cylinders feeding through a pressure regulator which will be set to the required supply pressure for the depth and equipment in use. In practice HP storage {{may be used for}} either reserve gas supply or both main and reserve gas supplies to a gas panel. High-pressure bulk cylinders are quiet in operation and provide gas of known quality (if it has been tested). This allows the relatively simple and reliable use of nitrox mixtures in <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving.</b> Bulk cylinders are also quiet in operation compared to a low-pressure compressor, but have the obvious limitation of amount of gas available.|$|E
500|$|Scuba diving is diving with a {{self-contained}} underwater breathing apparatus, which is completely independent of surface supply. [...] Scuba gives the diver mobility and horizontal range {{far beyond the}} reach of an umbilical hose attached to <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving</b> equipment (SSDE).|$|E
500|$|... "Cx70" [...] heliox {{tables were}} {{developed}} {{and used by}} Comex between 1970 and 1982. The tables were available in two versions. One was designed for <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving</b> and limited to 75m. The diver breathed heliox as the bottom mix and 100% oxygen at the 6m stop. The other was designed for closed bell bounce diving and allowed for exposures up to 120 minutes, and depths to 120m. The diver breathed heliox {{in the water and}} in the bell, air after transfer into the deck decompression chamber, and finally oxygen on built in breathing system (BIBS) from 12m to the surface. These tables produced a relatively high incidence of decompression sickness.|$|E
2500|$|The {{essential}} {{aspect of}} <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving</b> is that breathing gas is supplied from the surface, either from a specialized diving compressor, high-pressure cylinders, or both. In commercial and military <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving,</b> a backup source of breathing gas {{should always be}} present in case the primary supply fails. The diver may also wear a cylinder called a [...] "bail-out bottle," [...] which can provide self-contained breathing gas in an emergency. Thus, the surface-supplied diver is {{much less likely to}} have an [...] "out-of-air" [...] emergency than a scuba diver as there are normally two alternative air sources available.|$|E
2500|$|Scuba {{skills are}} the skills {{required}} to dive safely using self-contained underwater breathing apparatus, (scuba). Most of these skills {{are relevant to}} both open circuit and rebreather scuba, and many are also relevant to <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving.</b> Those skills which are critical {{to the safety of}} the diver may require more practice than is usually provided during training to achieve reliable long-term proficiency ...|$|E
2500|$|Hookah [...] A {{basic form}} of <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving</b> {{in which the}} air supply is via a single hose is often {{referred}} to as airline or Hookah (occasionally Hooka) diving. This often uses a standard scuba second stage as the delivery unit, but is also used with light full-face masks. Bailout gas may be carried, but this is not always the case. Commercial diamond divers working in the shallow zone off the west coast of South Africa under the codes of practice of the Department of Minerals and Energy use half mask and demand valve hookah, and no bailout as standard practice. Their safety record is relatively poor.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{hard-wired}} (cable) and through-water electronic voice {{communications systems}} {{may be used}} with <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving.</b> Wired systems are more popular {{as there is a}} physical connection to the diver for gas supply in any case, and adding a cable does not change the handling characteristics of the system. Wired communications systems are still more reliable and simpler to maintain than through-water systems. The communications equipment is relatively straightforward and may be of the two-wire or four-wire type. Two wire systems use the same wires for surface to diver and diver to surface messages, whereas four wire systems allow the diver's messages [...] and the surface operator's messages to use separate wire pairs.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{successful}} <b>surface-supplied</b> <b>diving</b> dress equipment {{was produced by}} the brothers Charles and John Deane in the 1820s. Inspired by a fire accident he witnessed in a stable in England, he designed and patented a [...] "Smoke Helmet" [...] {{to be used by}} firemen in smoke-filled areas in 1823. The apparatus comprised a copper helmet with an attached flexible collar and garment. A long leather hose attached {{to the rear of the}} helmet was to be used to supply air - the original concept being that it would be pumped using a double bellows. A short pipe allowed breathed air to escape. The garment was constructed from leather or airtight cloth, secured by straps.|$|E
