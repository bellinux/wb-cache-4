50|$|Shift by wire is {{the system}} by which the {{transmission}} modes are engaged/changed in an automobile through electronic controls without any mechanical linkage between the gear <b>shifting</b> <b>lever</b> and the transmission. The transmission shifting was traditionally accomplished by mechanical links to put the vehicle in Park, Reverse, Neutral and Drive positions through a lever mounted on the steering column or a gear shifter near the center console.|$|E
5000|$|The car {{was built}} in several {{modifications}} and these were now indicated by numbers rather than letters. The sedan version was called GAZ-24. GAZ-24-01 was the taxi, which included a robust artificial leather interior and a slightly modified ZMZ-21A engine to run on 80 RON petrol. GAZ-24-02 was the estate wagon, introduced in 1972. Unlike the GAZ-22, it was serially assembled on a reserve conveyor, rather than out of sedan side panels. The rear, fifth, door was now a single unit that opened upwards instead of sideways. The car could seat eight people, due to a third row of seats in the cargo section. To allow maximum cargo volume and functionality, the seats in third and second rows were split (rather than a single bench) and could be folded independently of each other. GAZ-24-03 was the ambulance version of the -02. GAZ-24-04 was the taxi estate, with the powerplant and interior trim of the -01. In 1977 a GAZ-24-07 conversion kit was introduced for taxiparks. The GAZ-24-24 was the successor to the GAZ-23 [...] "Chaser", with an identical V8 and automatic gearbox from the Chaika. Yet, unlike the -23, given {{the purpose of the}} car, even less effort was put in to differentiate it from standard vehicle due to costs. For example, the automatic selector was masked under a standard <b>shifting</b> <b>lever.</b> A small batch of export cars for countries with left-hand traffic was called GAZ-24-54 (less than a thousand examples built). GAZ-24-76 and -77 were export versions to Benelux countries, who would retrofit the cars with Indénor diesels and a more luxurious trim such as vinyl roof. Five experimental vehicles were built on the chassis of GAZ-69 4×4, called GAZ-24-95, one of which was known to be personally used by Leonid Brezhnev.|$|E
25|$|The direct-shift gearbox uses a {{floor-mounted}} transmission <b>shift</b> <b>lever,</b> {{very similar}} to that of a conventional automatic transmission. The lever is operated in a straight 'fore and aft' plane (without any 'dog-leg' offset movements), and uses an additional button to help prevent an inadvertent selection of an inappropriate <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> position.|$|R

2500|$|P {{position}} of the floor-mounted gear <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> means that the transmission is set in park. [...] Both clutch packs are fully disengaged, all gear-sets are disengaged, and a solid mechanical transmission lock {{is applied to the}} crown wheel of the DSG's internal differential. [...] This position must only be used when the motor vehicle is [...] [...] Furthermore, this is the position which must be set on the <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> before the vehicle ignition key can be removed.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{there are}} many gear positions, {{shifting}} through gears usually follows a regular pattern. For example, a series of upshifts might use [...] "move to splitter direct; move to splitter overdrive; move <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> to No. 2 and move splitter to underdrive; move splitter to direct; move splitter to overdrive; move <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> to No. 3 and move splitter to underdrive"; and so on. In older trucks using floor-mounted levers, a bigger problem is common gear shifts require the drivers to move their hands between <b>shift</b> <b>levers</b> in a single shift, and without synchromesh, shifts must be carefully timed or the transmission will not engage. For this reason, some splitter transmissions have an additional [...] "under under" [...] range, so when the splitter is already in [...] "under" [...] it can be quickly downshifted again, without the delay of a double shift.|$|R

50|$|Attempting {{to select}} reverse while {{the vehicle is}} moving forward causes severe gear wear (except in {{transmissions}} with synchromesh on the reverse gear). However, most manual transmissions have a gate that locks out reverse directly from 5th gear to help prevent this. In order to engage reverse from 5th, the <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> has to be moved to the center position between 3rd and 4th, then back over and into reverse. Another widespread solution places reverse {{to the left of}} 1st gear, instead of behind the 5th (where one might expect to find a 6th gear). Many newer six-speed manual transmissions have a collar under the shift knob which must be lifted to engage reverse. Other reverse lockout designs include having to push the <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> inward, toward the floor, to allow engagement of reverse, or requiring the driver to exert additional force to move the <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> into reverse.|$|R
50|$|Sequential manual {{transmissions}} work {{by providing}} the driver {{with the ability to}} select the gear directly before or after the gear currently engaged. Usually the <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> is pulled back to select the adjacent higher gear and pushed forwards to select the adjacent lower gear. On a true sequential gearbox, the <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> operates a ratchet mechanism that converts the fore & aft motion of the <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> into a rotary motion. This rotary action turns a selector drum (sometimes called a barrel) which has three or four tracks machined around its circumference. Running in the tracks are the selector forks, either directly, or via selector rods. These tracks deviate around the circumference and as the drum rotates, the selector forks running in the tracks are moved to select the required gear. Only a true sequential transmission has a shift mechanism that operates in this way.|$|R

5000|$|An {{optional}} accessory on some 1935-1938 Hudson and Terraplane models was a steering column-mounted electric gear pre-selector and electro-mechanical automatic shifting system, {{known as}} the [...] "Electric Hand", manufactured by the Bendix Corporation. This took {{the place of the}} floor-mounted <b>shift</b> <b>lever,</b> but required conventional clutch actions. Cars equipped with Electric Hand also carried a conventional <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> in clips under the dash, which could be pulled out and put to use in case the Electric Hand should ever fail. Hudson was also noted for offering an optional vacuum-powered automatic clutch, starting in the early 1930s.|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{intelligent}} transportation system (ITS), automatic interpretation of a driver’s behavior is an urgent and challenging topic. This paper studies vision-based driving posture recognition in the human action recognition framework. A driving action dataset was prepared by a side-mounted camera looking at a driver’s left profile. The driving actions, including operating the <b>shift</b> <b>lever,</b> talking on a cell phone, eating, and smoking, are first decomposed {{into a number of}} predefined action primitives, that is, interaction with <b>shift</b> <b>lever,</b> operating the <b>shift</b> <b>lever,</b> interaction with head, and interaction with dashboard. A global grid-based representation for the action primitives was emphasized, which first generate the silhouette shape from motion history image, followed by application of the pyramid histogram of oriented gradients (PHOG) for more discriminating characterization. The random forest (RF) classifier was then exploited to classify the action primitives together with comparisons to some other commonly applied classifiers such as kNN, multiple layer perceptron, and support vector machine. Classification accuracy is over 94 % for the RF classifier in holdout and cross-validation experiments on the four manually decomposed driving actions...|$|R

50|$|The {{transmission}} {{options are}} either a Lamborghini-sourced six-speed manual gearbox with metal gate for the <b>shift</b> <b>lever,</b> or an Audi-developed R Tronic gearbox—which is a semi-automatic, without a traditional clutch pedal with automatic gears shifting mode.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the 5-speed manual transmission, a 6-speed manual or 5-speed Sequential Manual Transmission (SMT) was also available starting in 2002. SMT is standard feature in Australian market; however, air conditioning was optional. After 2003, a 6-speed SMT was an option. The SMT had no conventional H-pattern <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> or clutch pedal. The driver could shift gears by tapping the <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> forward or backward or by pressing steering-wheel mounted buttons. Clutch engagement is automatic, and the car will automatically shift to second and then first gear when stopping. Cruise control was never offered with the manual transmission, but was standard for SMT cars.|$|R

50|$|Alfine is {{the name}} of a comfort and urban {{oriented}} product series by Shimano. It is mainly known for internally geared hubs, but includes also hydraulic disc brakes and levers, chain tensioners, dynamo hubs, cranksets, <b>shift</b> <b>levers,</b> and complete wheels.|$|R
5000|$|The Super Shift gearbox was {{developed}} from a standard four-speed manual transmission {{for use in}} the first generation Mitsubishi Mirage, the company's first front wheel drive model. [...] As the transmission was mounted beneath the engine, the gearbox needed to take power down from the clutch. It was not possible to do this directly as this would have meant that the gearbox rotated in the opposite direction to that required, and therefore the use of an extra 'idle' shaft was required. It was subsequently realised that this shaft could be modified as a separate 2-speed gearbox, which would be controlled by a secondary <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> mounted alongside the main gear <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> inside the cabin.|$|R

500|$|A single dry-plate clutch and an unsynchronized three-speed gearbox were {{bolted to}} the engine. [...] The gearbox was {{operated}} directly with a central <b>shift</b> <b>lever.</b> The drive shaft was enclosed in a torque tube and drove the live rear axle through a spiral bevel drive.|$|R
50|$|To achieve lighter shift {{effort with}} a short <b>shift</b> <b>lever</b> stroke, the lever ratio is increased. However, to {{overcome}} the shorter internal stroke, a small module spline is used. Shift throws are reduced by 15 percent, making it the shortest shifting of any passenger car.|$|R
