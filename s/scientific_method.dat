5|$|A common neo-creationist {{objection}} to evolution is that evolution does not adhere to normal scientific standards—that {{it is not}} genuinely scientific. It is argued that evolutionary biology does not follow the <b>scientific</b> <b>method</b> and therefore should not be taught in science classes, or at least should be taught alongside other views (i.e., creationism). These objections often deal with {{the very nature of}} evolutionary theory, the <b>scientific</b> <b>method,</b> and philosophy of science.|$|E

The methods was the quasi experiment research with the randomized control group pretestt posttest design. This research was implemented in one of SMK Negeri in Kota Bandung by taking two classes as samples which choosen by cluster random sampling, one class as the experiment class and the other as control class. The experiment class used the Science Technology Society model with <b>scientific</b> <b>methods</b> and the control class used the Science Technology Society model without <b>scientific</b> <b>methods.</b> The data’s research was collected by using literacy science test,students and teacher respon attitude scale and observation sheet. The data were analyzed using: independent sample t-test of SPSS 16 and persentage of average. The result of {{this research}} showed that the increasing of students’ scientific literacy used Science Technology Society model with <b>scientific</b> <b>methods</b> higher than students’ scientific literacy used Science Technology Society model without <b>scientific</b> <b>methods.</b> The N-Gain of experiment class was 0. 31 and the control was 0. 24 with α= 0. 05.

5|$|A {{fundamental}} {{influence on}} Durkheim's {{thought was the}} sociological positivism of Auguste Comte, who effectively sought to extend and apply the <b>scientific</b> <b>method</b> found in the natural sciences to the social sciences. According to Comte, a true social science should stress for empirical facts, as well as induce general scientific laws from the relationship among these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis. First, he accepted {{that the study of}} society was to be founded on an examination of facts. Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was the <b>scientific</b> <b>method.</b> Third, he agreed with Comte that the social sciences could become scientific only when they were stripped of their metaphysical abstractions and philosophical speculation. At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.|$|E

5|$|During his {{university}} {{studies at the}} École, Durkheim was influenced by two neo-Kantian scholars, Charles Bernard Renouvier and Émile Boutroux.

5|$|Poe eschewed the <b>scientific</b> <b>method</b> in Eureka {{and instead}} wrote from pure intuition. For this reason, he {{considered}} it a work of art, not science, but insisted that it was still true and considered it to be his career masterpiece. Even so, Eureka is full of scientific errors.

5|$|The {{overarching}} methodological {{principle of}} positivism is to conduct sociology in broadly {{the same manner}} as natural science.

5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in <b>scientific</b> <b>method,</b> but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E

While polling studies have demonstrated that approximately 25% of Americans, Canadians, and Britons say they continue to believe that star and planet positions affect their lives, astrology is now recognized as pseudoscience.|$|E

5|$|In {{fields such}} as {{astrophysics}} or meteorology, where direct observation or laboratory experiments are difficult or impossible, the <b>scientific</b> <b>method</b> instead relies on observation and logical inference. In such fields, the test of falsifiability is satisfied when a theory is used to predict the results of new observations. When such observations contradict a theory's predictions, it may be revised or discarded if an alternative better explains the observed facts. For example, Newton's theory of gravitation was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity when the latter was observed to more precisely predict the orbit of Mercury.|$|E
5|$|Several {{branches}} of creationism, including creation science, neo-creationism, and intelligent design, {{argue that the}} idea of life being directly designed by a god or intelligence is at least as scientific as evolutionary theory, and should therefore be taught in public education. Such arguments against evolution have become widespread and include objections to evolution's evidence, methodology, plausibility, morality, and scientific acceptance. The scientific community does not recognize such objections as valid, pointing to detractors' misinterpretations of such things as the <b>scientific</b> <b>method,</b> evidence, and basic physical laws.|$|E

5|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the sweep of}} botanical history it is evident that, {{through the power of}} the <b>scientific</b> <b>method,</b> most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} {{philosophy}} of science trace back to Plato and Aristotle who distinguished {{the forms of}} approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of abductive, deductive, and inductive inference, and also analyzed reasoning by analogy. The eleventh century Arab polymath Ibn al-Haytham (known in Latin as Alhazen) conducted his research in optics by way of controlled experimental testing and applied geometry, especially in his investigations into the images resulting from the reflection and refraction of light. Roger Bacon (1214–1294), an English thinker and experimenter heavily influenced by al-Haytham, is recognized {{by many to be}} the father of modern <b>scientific</b> <b>method.</b> His view that mathematics was essential to a correct understanding of natural philosophy was considered to be 400 years ahead of its time.|$|E

He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of psittacosis and Q fever. After finding that parrots and cockatoos were infected with psittacosis and were responsible for transmission, he lobbied the government for a ban {{in order to prevent}} human infection, but he was rebuffed and later came to agree with the government position that there was not much danger. During the time he worked on Q fever with Australian scientist E.H. Derrick, the causative organism of which was named Coxiella burnetii in Burnet's honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the laboratory. His epidemiological studies of herpes and Q fever displayed an appreciation of the ecology of infectious disease that became a characteristic of his <b>scientific</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E
