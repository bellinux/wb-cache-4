6000|$|I am {{scarcely}} {{drawing the}} portrait of a very melancholy man. It is not indeed my character; and I had, in a comparison with my comrades, many reasons for content. In the first place, I had no family: I was an orphan and a bachelor; neither wife nor child awaited me in France. In the second, I had never wholly forgot the emotions with which I first found myself a prisoner; and although a military prison be not altogether a garden of delights, it is still preferable to a gallows. In the third, I am almost ashamed to say it, but I found a certain pleasure in our place of residence: being an obsolete and really mediaeval fortress, high placed and commanding extraordinary prospects, not only over sea, mountain, and champaign but actually over the thoroughfares of a capital city, which we could see blackened by day with the moving crowd of the inhabitants, and at night shining with lamps. And lastly, although I was not insensible to the restraints of prison or the scantiness of our rations, I remembered I had sometimes eaten quite as ill in Spain, and had to mount guard and march perhaps a dozen leagues into the bargain. The first of my troubles, indeed, was the costume we were obliged to wear. There is a horrible practice in England to trick out in ridiculous uniforms, and as it were to brand in mass, not only convicts but military prisoners, and even the children in charity schools. I think some malignant genius had found his masterpiece of irony in the dress which we were condemned to wear: jacket, waistcoat, and trousers of a <b>sulphur</b> or <b>mustard</b> yellow, and a shirt or blue-and-white striped cotton. It was conspicuous, it was cheap, it pointed us out to laughter—we, who were old soldiers, used to arms, and some of us showing noble scars,—like a set of lugubrious zanies at a fair. The old name of that rock on which our prison stood was (I have heard since then) the Painted Hill. Well, now it was all painted a bright yellow with our costumes; and the dress of the soldiers who guarded us being of course the essential British red rag, we made up together the elements of a lively picture of hell. I have again and again looked round upon my fellow-prisoners, and felt my anger rise, and choked upon tears, to behold them thus parodied. The more part, as I have said, were peasants, somewhat bettered perhaps by the drill-sergeant, but for all that ungainly, loutish fellows, with no more than a mere barrack-room smartness of address: indeed, you could have seen our army nowhere more discreditably represented than in this Castle of Edinburgh. And I used to see myself in fancy, and blush. It seemed that my more elegant carriage would but point the insult of the travesty. And I remembered the days when I wore the coarse but honourable coat of a soldier; and remembered further back how many of the noble, the fair, and the gracious had taken a delight to tend my childhood. [...] . But I must not recall these tender and sorrowful memories twice; their place is further on, and I am now upon another business. The perfidy of the Britannic Government stood nowhere more openly confessed than in one particular of our discipline: that we were shaved twice in the week. To a man who has loved all his life to be fresh shaven, can a more irritating indignity be devised? Monday and Thursday were the days. Take the Thursday, and conceive the picture I must present by Sunday evening! And Saturday, which was almost as bad, was the great day for visitors.|$|R

Laminin was, however, found to be partially degraded as determined by the reso-lution of 132 and 143 kDa fragments, possibly by the acti-vation of proteases, following the application of <b>sulphur</b> <b>mustard</b> to pig skin. Type IV collagen was not subject to this form of degradation in the skin samples exposed to <b>sulphur</b> <b>mustard.</b> 3 Yucatan mini-pig skin was found to develop microblis-ters after exposure to <b>sulphur</b> <b>mustard</b> vapour.

Application of WoundStat™ significantly reduced the amount and rate of SM penetration through the skin in vitro. Furthermore, WoundStat™ reduced SM percutaneous absorption and pathology in vivo.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of toxicity of <b>sulphur</b> <b>mustard</b> was investigated {{by examining the}} biochemical effects of the analog 2 -chloroethylethyl sulphide (CEES) in both human Jurkat cells as well as normal human lymphocytes. Exposure of both types of cells to CEES resulted in a marked decrease in the intracellular concentration of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH), and CEES-induced cell death was potentiated by L-buthionine sulphoximine, an inhibitor of GSH synthesis. CEES increased the endogenous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Jurkat cells, and CEES-induced cell death was potentiated by hydrogen peroxide. CEES induced various hallmarks of apoptosis, including collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, proteolytic processing and activation of procaspase- 3, and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. The effects of CEES on the accumulation of ROS, the intracellular concentration of GSH, the mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase- 3 activity were all inhibited by pretreatment of cells with the GSH precursor N-acetyl cysteine or with GSH-ethyl ester. Furthermore, CEES-induced cell death was also prevented by these antioxidants. CEES toxicity appears to be mediated, at least in part, by the generation of ROS and consequent depletion of GSH.

The histopathological features of the developing cutaneous HD lesion in female Yucatan minipigs up to 24 hours post exposure are reported. Following challenge with HD vapour at a concentration of 12. 0 [*]μmol/cm 2 a sequence of ultrastructural changes to keratinocytes occurred which were initially seen in the stratum basale. Condensation of nuclear heterochromatin and loss of euchromatin was accompanied by cytoplasmic swelling and culminated in focal epidermal necrosis which was evident at 24 [*]h after the challenge...|$|E
40|$|Assessment of the {{biochemical}} {{effects of}} percutaneous exposure of <b>sulphur</b> <b>mustard</b> in an in vitro human skin system CD Lindsay and P Rice Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment, Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire, SP 4 0 JQ, UK 1 <b>Sulphur</b> <b>mustard</b> (HD) {{is a potent}} chemical warfare agent which causes incapacitating blisters on human skin. There is no specific pretreatment nor therapy against this agent and the mechanism of dermo-epidermal cleavage is unclear. The {{aim of this study}} was to use a human skin explant system to determine the consequences of percuta-neous exposure to HD. 2 Increased activities of serine proteases associated with blistering disorders in humans were detected from human skin explants after exposure to HD. The most consistent response and the highest protease activities measured were found for trypsin. This class of enzyme is therefore implicated in the dermo-epidermal separation which is associated with blistering in humans following exposure to HD. 3 An inflammatory response was observed in the skin explants exposed to HD. At low doses of HD it was characterised by the presence of neutrophils in the papillary dermis, culminating in the infiltration of the epidermis by these inflammatory cells at higher concen-trations of HD. A variety of other histopathological changes in the explants was found such as focal dermo-epidermal separation, nuclear pyknosis and perinuclear vacuolation. 4 The study indicates that full thickness human skin explants can be used to investigate various aspects of the possible pathogenesis of HD-induced skin damage, in-cluding the associated inflammatory response...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sulphur</b> <b>mustard</b> (HD) is a {{chemical}} warfare (CW) agent with well established toxic properties. The Iran-Iraq (1980 - 1988) conflict demonstrated that HD {{is still a}} major CW hazard on the modern battlefield. Though known for its skin blistering properties, most of the mortality associated with HD is due to lung damage and associated infections. The aim of this work {{is to establish a}} method of exposing the lower respiratory tract to HD in an anaesthetised pig which would model humans breathing through their mouths and bypassing the nasal passages. The effects of such exposure on the physiology, biochemistry, haematology and pathology would then be investigated. The results obtained will be used to identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention...|$|E

Hall, et al, 'Development of haemostatic decontaminants for the {{treatment}} of wounds contaminated with chemical warfare agents. 1 : Evaluation of in vitro clotting efficacy in teh presence of certain contaminants', vol. 35 (5) : 536 - 542, May 2015, doi: 10. 1002 /jat. 3019. Copyright ?? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. The treatment of penetrating, haemorrhaging injuries sustained within a hazardous environment may be complicated by contamination with toxic chemicals. There are currently no specific medical countermeasures for such injuries. Haemostats with an absorbent mechanism of action have the potential to simultaneously stop bleeding and decontaminate wounds. However, a primary requirement of a 'haemostatic decontaminant' is the retention of clotting function in the presence of chemical contaminants. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the haemostatic efficacy of seven commercially available haemostats in the presence of toxic chemicals (soman, VX, <b>sulphur</b> <b>mustard,</b> petrol, aviation fuel and motor oil). Clot viscosity was assessed ex vivo using thrombelastography following treatment of pig blood with: (i) toxic chemical; (ii) haemostat; or (iii) haemostat in combination with toxic chemical. Several contaminants (VX, petrol and GD) were found to be pro-haemostatic and none had an adverse effect on the rate with which the test products attained haemostasis. However, the total clot strength for blood treated with certain haemostats in the presence of <b>sulphur</b> <b>mustard,</b> soman and petrol was significantly decreased. Three test products failed to demonstrate haemostatic function in this ex vivo (thrombelastography) model; this was tentatively ascribed to the products achieving haemostasis through a tamponade mechanism of action, which can only be replicated using in vivo models. Overall, this study has identified a number of commercial products that may have potential as haemostatic decontaminants and warrant further investigation to establish their decontaminant efficacy.

40|$|<b>Sulphur</b> <b>mustard</b> (SM) is a {{chemical}} warfare agent that causes serious blisters upon contact with human skin. SM alkylates DNA {{and several other}} macromolecules, and also induces oxidative stress. Quercetin, a bioflavonoid has wide pharmacological actions. The protective efficacy of quercetin (100 mg/kg, i. p. and 200 mg/kg, i. p.) was studied by administering three doses in mice against SM. The first dose was administered at 30 min prior, simultaneous, 2 h post or 24 h post, and two more doses on the next two days. SM was administered (in PEG 300) percutaneously at varying doses for survival and protection studies. SM was also administered at a dose of 2 LD 50 (19. 3 mg/kg) with and without quercetin treatment and various biochemical markers were estimated 7 days after SM administration. Histological examinations of vital organs were also carried out. The animals administered with SM died at various days depending upon the dose. The body weight decreased significantly. Quercetin protected the mice significantly, in a dose-dependent manner. The protection was better when the first dose of quercetin administered was 30 min prior or simultaneously. A significant decrease in reduced as well as oxidised glutathione {{and an increase in}} malondialdehyde, WBC count, RBC count, and haemoglobin were observed with 2 LD 50 SM. Quercetin at 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg doses significantly protected the biochemical markers when the first dose of quercetin administered was 30 min prior or as simultaneous treatment. The histological lesions induced by <b>sulphur</b> <b>mustard</b> on liver, spleen, and skin were also significantly protected by quercetin when the first dose was administered 30 min prior or as simultaneous treatment. The present study shows that percutaneous administration of SM induces oxidative stress and quercetin can protect it as a prophylactic agent...|$|E
40|$|This exploratory, {{descriptive}} study investigates {{the experiences of}} Iranian war veterans living with chronic disease acquired {{as a result of}} chemical warfare. <b>Sulphur</b> <b>mustard</b> (SM) {{is considered one of the}} most important agents of chemical warfare and was widely used during the Iran–Iraq conflict in 1980 – 1988. There are approximately 100 000 Iranian SM casualties who suffer from serious long-term progressive health problems involving their respiratory organs, eyes and skin. Seventeen male Iranian war veterans aged between 30 and 59 years and four victims' family members participated in the study. Data was generated during individual in-depth interviews that used open-ended questions. Grounded theory techniques, including the constant comparative method of concurrent data generation and analysis, were employed in the analysis of data. Preliminary results indicate two main thematic categories: social isolation and physical disability. It is argued that a lack of knowledge about the outcomes of SM poisoning, physical restrictions and difficulty in adjusting socially decreases war veterans' functional capacity and levels of independence...|$|E
40|$|Miswak is a chewing stick that {{derives from}} Arak tree (Salvadora persica) {{which is used}} as {{cleansing}} teeth. It is used in different part of Africa, Asia especially in Middle East, South of America, 2 India, Pakistan and mostly of Muslim community. This custom was adopted and Islamized by Prophet Muhammad (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon Him/PBUH) because there are several hadith mentioning the benefits of siwak in maintaining oral hygiene. Many {{studies have been done}} to explore the oral hygiene advantages of this stick. Salvadora persica contains trimethylamine, salvadorine, chloride, fluoride, silica, <b>sulphur,</b> <b>mustard</b> oil, vitamin C, resins and traces of tannins, saponins, flavonoids and sterol. Actually this chemical composition influence to the oral hygiene. The unique chemicals component, fibers proved the effect to periodontal status, caries, antimicrobial, cleanness, whitening, calculus removal, and so on.
