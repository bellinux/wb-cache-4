40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} study the incidence and the causes of sow mortality in breeding herds. Data were obtained from 24 swine breeding herds with an average inventory of 3755 sows and served gilts for the total sample. Producers were involved for 12 consecutive months and agreed {{to submit to the}} diagnostic laboratory every dead or moribund sow and <b>served</b> <b>gilt.</b> The average herd death rate was 3. 3 % +/- 0. 5 (SEM), but varied considerably among herds, ranging from 0 % to 9. 2 %. A total of 137 sows and mated gilts died during the year, and these females had produced an average of 4. 2 litters +/- 0. 2 (SEM). The number of deaths was significantly higher during the months of July, August and October. The peripartum period appeared to be when sows were most at risk, with 42 % of all deaths occurring during this short period of the reproductive cycle. The three major causes of death were heart failure (31. 4 %), torsions and accidents of abdominal organs (15. 3 %) and cystitis-pyelonephritis (8. 0 %). Other causes included endometritis (6. 6 %), uterine prolapses (6. 6 %), pneumonia (3. 6 %), gastric ulcers (3. 6 %), downer sow syndrome (2. 2 %), miscellaneous (8. 0 %) and unknown (14. 6 %) ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analysed}} first parity productivity records over {{a determined}} time period {{of three years}} from two selected commercial pig production units on the Highveld, and determined whether seasonal differences in productivity occur in relation to seasonal temperature fluctuations, and {{whether there is a}} difference in seasonal productivity between farms. The total pool of records used in various models corresponded to first parity breeding records from two farms for 2600 sows born between 1 March 2004 and 28 February 2007. Parameters of performance taken from the records included 1) Date of birth (DoB), 2) Year of Birth (YoB) of gilt, 3) Season of Birth (SB) of gilt, 4) Age at first service (AFS), 5) Season of First Service (SS), 6) Year of First Service (YoS), 7) Number of Services (NoS), 8) Farrowing date (FD), 9) Year of Farrowing (YoF), 10) Season of Farrowing (SF), 11) Total number of piglets born (TB), 12) Number of piglets born alive (BA), 13) Number of stillborn piglets (BD), 14) Number of mummified piglets (GA), 15) Weaning date (WD), 16) Backfat thickness (BF) of the gilts at farrowing (BFF), 17) BF at weaning (BFW) and 18) Weaning to service interval (WSI). The gilts from both farms were of the same synthetic genetic line and originated from one of three Farms of Birth (FoB). Daily maximum and minimum outdoor temperature data for the period between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2007 were obtained from the South African Weather Service for the areas in which the production farms are situated. There were seasonal differences in productivity between years, within years and between farms but were not necessarily directly linked to the seasonal temperature fluctuations in all cases. The FoB influenced AFS significantly (P< 0. 0001). For farms pooled there was no seasonal difference in AFS between gilts born in summer and gilts born in autumn, winter and spring. However, gilts born in autumn were younger at AFS than gilts born in winter (P < 0. 0001) and spring (P= 0. 0008), but differences in AFS of gilts born in winter and spring were not significant. There was no difference in TB or BA from sows receiving either one or two services before successful conception. There was no seasonal difference of TB or BA between <b>gilts</b> first <b>served</b> in summer, autumn, winter or spring. There were, however, fewer TB from <b>gilts</b> <b>served</b> during 2006 than from <b>gilts</b> <b>served</b> during either 2005 (P= 0. 0007) or 2007 (P= 0. 0002) but differences in TB from <b>gilts</b> <b>served</b> during 2005 and 2007 were NS. There was no difference in BA between years. For farms pooled, there was no seasonal difference in WSI between gilts farrowed in summer, autumn, winter or spring. There was a tendency for the sows to return to service during the summer months more than in any other season. There was a seasonal difference in number of piglets born per litter between farms between years. Dissertation (MSc (Agric)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|Young boars (10 months) expressing either high (HLB) or low (LLB) libido in {{standardized}} mating {{tests were}} compared {{for their ability}} to stimulate earlier puberty in gilts. Boar exposure was initiated when gilts were either 140 or 160 days old to determine whether the effect of boar libido on attainment of puberty in gilts is influenced by sexual maturation (age) of the gilts. Another group of gilts was isolated from boars (NBE, not boar exposed) and <b>served</b> as controls. <b>Gilts</b> exposed to HLB (10 min/day) reached puberty 8. 9 days earlier (P 3 ̆c. 06) than gilts exposed to LLB. Gilts exposed to boars, regardless of libido level, reached puberty 21 days earlier (P 3 ̆c. 01) than the control gilts. Boar exposure initiated at 140 days induced puberty 11. 3 days earlier (P 3 ̆c. 06) than when initiated at 160 days. Differences in pubertal responses between HLB and LLB were similar when exposure was initiated at 140 or 160 days. Boar libido is {{an important component of the}} boar-stimulating effect on puberty in gilts. Therefore, gilts should be exposed to boars with relatively high libido to achieve optimal pubertal development...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Polyethylene spirals (IUDs) were {{inserted}} by laparotomy on the 1 st day of oestrus {{into one}} or both uterine horns of cyclic gilts; sham-operated <b>gilts</b> <b>served</b> as controls. Immediate post-operative oestrous cycles averaged 20 =. days for twenty-seven gilts with IUDs and 19 =. days for fourteen controls. Eleven gilts with IUDs were mated at nineteen later oestrous periods; all returned to oestrus after mating, with cycles averaging 21 =. days. Gilts were autopsied at 3, 8 to 10 or 14 days after mating. Ova were fertilized in IUD gilts and most embryos were still alive 8 to 10 days after mating. A high rate of embryonic mortality occurred between 8 and 14 days. Leucocytes {{were present in the}} uterine lumen of IUD gilts at 8 to 10 and 14 days after mating. In twenty gilts killed 9 or 14 days after mating, weights of corpora lutea were significantly less in IUD gilts than in controls; luteal pro-gesterone levels, however, did not differ significantly. In the IUD gilts {{there was no evidence that}} corpora lutea were smaller on the side of the IUD than on the contralateral side...|$|R
40|$|Vaccination against {{progressive}} {{atrophic rhinitis}} using a purified recombinant derivative of the Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT), was carried out. Ten pregnant gilts were vaccinated twice with the nontoxic derivative (dO) which {{apart from a}} lack of 121 amino acids had an amino acid sequence identical to PMT, while seven gilts were vaccinated with a purified, formaldehyde treated, native PMT and ten <b>gilts</b> <b>served</b> as non-vaccinated controls. The resulting piglets were inoculated intranasally with Bordetella bronchiseptica and toxigenic P. multocida. Among piglets from the nonvaccinated gilts all except one developed clinical atrophic rhinitis and 90 % developed severe turbinate atrophy while only a few pigs in the vaccinated groups developed clinical or pathological signs of disease. Gilt colostra from the two vaccinated groups had similar mean anti-PMT titers and the mean titers in the offspring's sera from these groups were nearly identical throughout the study. No pigs born from unvaccinated gilts were seropositive until 8 wk of age (7 wk post-challenge) but 23 % became seropositive at slaughter. The infection rate with toxigenic P. multocida in piglets and the total number of P. multocida colonies cultured from nasal swabs were significantly reduced at 5 wk and 8 wk of age in the vaccinated groups, when compared to controls. There was a significantly improved weight gain (greater than 9 %) from birth to slaughter in offspring from vaccinated gilts. No significant differences in feed conversion rate or % lean meat were observed among the groups. The study showed the excellent immunoprotective properties of the nontoxic derivative of the PMT molecule...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} {{extensive}} research, {{the mechanisms of}} reproductive disease associated with Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSv) are still poorly understood. The objectives of this large scale study were to evaluate associations between viral load and fetal preservation, determine the impact of type 2 PRRSv on fetal weights, and investigate changes in ORF 5 PRRSv genome in dams and fetuses during a 21 -day period following challenge. At gestation day 85 (± 1), 114 gilts were experimentally infected with type 2 PRRSv, while 19 <b>gilts</b> <b>served</b> as reference controls. At necropsy, fetuses were categorized according to their preservation status and tissue samples were collected. PRRSv RNA concentrations were measured in gilt serum collected on days 0, 2, 6, and 21 post-infection, {{as well as in}} gilt and fetal tissues collected at termination. Fetal mortality was 41 ± 22. 8 % in PRRS infected litters. Dead fetuses appeared to cluster in some litters but appeared solitary or random in others. Nine percent of surviving piglets were meconium-stained. PRRSv RNA concentration in fetal thymus, fetal serum and endometrium differed significantly across preservation category and was greatest in tissues of meconium-stained fetuses. This, together with the virtual absence of meconium staining in non-infected litters indicates it is an early pathological condition of reproductive PRRS. Viral load in fetal thymus and in fetal serum was positively associated with viral load in endometrium, suggesting the virus exploits dynamic linkages between individual maternal-fetal compartments. Point mutations in ORF 5 sequences from gilts and fetuses were randomly located in 20 positions in ORF 5, but neither nucleotide nor amino acid substitutions were associated with fetal preservation. PRRSv infection decreased the weights of viable fetuses by approximately 17 %. The considerable variation in gilt and fetal outcomes provides tremendous opportunity for more detailed investigations of potential mechanisms and single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with fetal death...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} {{of fetal}} death associated with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is hypothesized to be {{a consequence of}} PRRS virus-induced apoptosis at the maternal-fetal interface (MFI). The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate distribution and degree of apoptosis in the uterine and fetal placental tissues during the experimental type 2 PRRS virus (PRRSV) infection and determine associations between apoptosis at the MFI, PRRSV RNA concentration and antigen staining intensity, PRRSV-induced microscopic lesions, and fetal preservation status. A total of 114 naïve, high-health pregnant gilts were inoculated with type 2 PRRSV on gestation day 85 ± 1 with euthanasia 21 days later; 19 sham-inoculated <b>gilts</b> <b>served</b> as controls. Two hundred and fifty samples of uterine tissue with fetal placenta were selected based on negative, low PRRSV RNA, and high PRRSV RNA concentration (0, 2. 7 log 10 copies/mg, respectively). TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptosis in the endometrium and at the MFI. PRRSV RNA concentration and numbers of PRRSV immunopositive cells in uterine and placental tissue were positively associated with the severity of apoptosis in the endometrium and the MFI (P< 0. 001, P< 0. 05 and P< 0. 001, respectively). The number of TUNEL positive cells at the MFI was also positively associated with the severity (P< 0. 001) of vasculitis, but not total numbers of inflammatory cells in the endometrium. Increased numbers of TUNEL positive cells at the MFI were associated with PRRSV load in the fetal thymus, and greater odds of meconium staining of the fetus at 21 days post infection (P< 0. 001 for both). These findings suggest an important role of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of uterine epithelial and trophoblastic cell death at the MFI. Moreover, apoptosis at the MFI is significantly associated with fetal demise during in utero type 2 PRRSV infection...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Overweight {{and obesity}} {{are defined as}} {{abnormal}} or excessive fat accumulation that can be harmful to health. Obstetric complications increase in pregnant women with higher body mass index (BMI). Several studies show {{an increase in the}} number of caesarean sections due to these complications and also described the risk of caesarean section increases with increasing BMI. Objective: Determine whether the overweight-obesity is a predictor of cesarean delivery in pregnant <b>Gilts</b> <b>served</b> in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Hospital Belén de Trujillo Materials and Methods: the data of the clinical history of weight, height and BMI of 60 nulliparous pregnant women who met inclusion criteria to be designated as cases and 123 nulliparous pregnant women who made controls were analyzed. statistical measures that were used are population 9 attributable risk, risk exposure, prevalence and odds ratio. The association between variables was analyzed using the X 2 test Mantel - Haenszel. Results: prevalence of overweight and obesity of 75 % and 15 % respectively in cases and controls was found. In the group of nulliparous pregnant women with a BMI > 25, it was observed that 71. 43 % completed their cesarean delivery; while the total group of nulliparous pregnant women with BMI 25, se observó que el 71. 43 % finalizaron su parto por cesárea; mientras que del total del grupo de gestantes nulíparas con IMC< 25, el 8 12. 5 % finalizaron su parto por cesárea, con un OR= 17. 5 que nos indica que las gestantes nulíparas con IMC≥ 25 tienen 17. 5 veces más el riesgo de terminar su parto por cesárea respecto a las gestantes nulíparas con IMC< 25. El valor de X 2 fue de 2823. 4, esto nos indica la posibilidad muy remota de que esta asociación se deba simplemente al azar.

40|$|Gilt oestrus and {{ovulation}} {{responses to}} injection {{of a combination}} of equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) (PG 600) can be unpredictable, possibly reflecting inadequate circulating LH activity. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of PG 600 followed by supplemental hCG on gilt ovarian responses. In experiment 1, 212 Hypor gilts (160 day of age) housed on two farms in Spain received intramuscular (i. m.) injections of PG 600 (n = 47), or PG 600 with an additional 200 IU hCG injected either concurrently (hCG- 0; n = 39), or at 24 h (hCG- 24; n = 41) or 48 h (hCG- 48; n = 45) after PG 600. A further 40 <b>gilts</b> <b>served</b> as non-injected controls. Ovulation responses were determined on the basis of initial blood progesterone concentrations being 5 ng / ml 10 d after the PG 600 injection. The incidence of ovulating gilts having progesterone concentrations > 30 ng/ml were recorded. During the study period, 10 % of control gilts ovulated whereas 85 – 100 % of hormone-treated gilts ovulated. There were no significant differences among hormone groups for proportions of gilts ovulating. The proportions of gilts having circulating progesterone concentrations > 30 ng/ml were increased (p ≤ 0. 02) in all hCG treated groups compared with the PG 600 group. In experiment 2, a total of 76 Hypor gilts at either 150 or 200 days of age were injected with PG 600 (n = 18), 400 IU eCG followed by 200 IU hCG 24 h later (n = 20), PG 600 followed by 100 IU hCG 24 h later (n = 17), or 400 IU eCG followed by 300 IU hCG 24 h later (n = 21). Blood samples were obtained 10 days later for progesterone assay. There were no effects of treatment or age on incidence of ovulation, but fewer 150 -day-old gilts treated with PG 600 or 400 IU eCG followed by 200 IU hCG had progesterone concentrations > 30 ng / ml. We conclude that hCG treatment subsequent to PG 600 treatment will generate a higher circulating progesterone concentration, although the effect is not evident in older, presumably peripubertal, gilts. The mechanism involved and implications for fertility remain to be determined. R Manjarin, JC Dominguez, MJ Castro, B Alegre, MA Driancourt and RN Kirkwoo...|$|R
