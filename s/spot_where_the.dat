5|$|Another {{monument}} {{marks the}} <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> fire stopped: the Golden Boy of Pye Corner in Smithfield. According to the inscription, it {{was evidence of}} God's wrath on the City of London for the sin of gluttony that the fire started at Pudding Lane and stopped at Pye Corner.|$|E
5|$|On July 19, 2009, {{an impact}} site was {{discovered}} at approximately 216 degrees longitude in System 2. This impact {{left behind a}} black spot in Jupiter's atmosphere, similar in size to Oval BA. Infrared observation showed a bright <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> impact took place, meaning the impact warmed up the lower atmosphere in the area near Jupiter's south pole.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Oregon, Mulder and Skinner {{travel to}} the woods, {{equipped}} with lasers for finding the UFO. Noticing a <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> lasers cease in mid-air, Mulder walks through the force field. He finds and joins a group of abductees, including Billy and Theresa, standing below a pillar of light from a UFO; they are soon accosted by the Bounty Hunter. Mulder is abducted with the group while a stunned Skinner witnesses the UFO's departure.|$|E
5|$|The site of {{the cabins}} became a tourist {{attraction}} as early as 1854. In the 1880s, Charles McGlashan began promoting {{the idea of a}} monument to mark the {{site of the}} Donner Party episode. He helped to acquire the land for a monument and, in June 1918, the statue of a pioneer family was placed on the <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Breen-Keseberg cabin was thought to have been, dedicated to the Donner Party. It was made a California Historical Landmark in 1934.|$|E
5|$|Wainwright {{charged to}} the attack, but the {{submarine}} submerged almost immediately. Upon reaching the <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> submarine had been, the warship located an oil slick and began dropping depth charges which {{failed to achieve}} positive results. Approaching darkness {{and the necessity of}} escorting an Admiralty oiler forced Wainwright to break off her attack. After she shepherded the oiler to safety, she returned to the area of her attack and patrolled throughout the night, but the submarine had apparently retired from the neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|Chief Keokuk gave {{a generous}} portion {{of land to}} Antoine Le Claire's wife, Marguerite, the granddaughter of a Sauk chief. Le Claire built their home on the exact <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> {{agreement}} was signed, as stipulated by Keokuk, or he would have forfeited the land. Le Claire finished the 'Treaty House' {{in the spring of}} 1833. He founded Davenport on May 14, 1836, naming it for his friend Colonel George Davenport, who was stationed at Fort Armstrong during the war. The city was incorporated on January 25, 1839. The area was successively governed by the legislatures of the Michigan Territory, the Wisconsin Territory, Iowa Territory and finally Iowa.|$|E
5|$|Mike {{continues}} to blast the shark with the impulses, {{causing it to}} leap {{out of the water}} again, igniting the bomb as Ellen steers the sailboat towards the shark while thinking back to Sean's demise, the shark's attack on Thea, and when her husband killed the first shark. The broken bowsprit impales the shark in the exact <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> bomb is, causing it to explode on impact. The shark's corpse then sinks {{to the bottom of the}} sea. Mike then hears Jake calling for help, seriously injured, but alive and conscious, floating in the water. The four survive the harsh encounter and make it back to land. Hoagie then flies Ellen back to Amity Island.|$|E
5|$|The Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple, {{which is}} {{situated}} by the Asi River, {{is one of}} the sacred temples of the Hindu god Hanuman. The present temple was built in the early 1900s by the educationist and Indian independence figure, Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, the founder of Banaras Hindu University. According to Hindu legend the temple was built on the <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> medieval Hindu saint Tulsidas had a vision of Hanuman. During a 7 March 2006 terrorist attack, one of three explosions hit the temple while a wedding was in progress, and resulted in injuries to 30 people apart from 23 deaths. Following the attack, a permanent police post was installed inside the temple.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Super Punch-Out!! {{is similar}} to that of its arcade and NES/FC predecessors. The player controls a nameable boxer as he fights his way to become W.V.B.A. Champion. The player controls the boxer from a third-person perspective, with him being translucent on the screen. Players can attack their opponents with jabs to the face or with body blows from either hand. The opponent can deflect punches, so players must aim at the opponent's open <b>spot</b> (<b>where</b> <b>the</b> gloves are not) to connect. Depending on the opponents' stances, they will guard themselves differently, so players need to use the correct punches.|$|E
5|$|At 05:13 on 5 August, Bridgeports lookouts spotted Ushant Light. At 06:40, SC-48 sighted a torpedo {{and sounded}} a warning. Two minutes later, men {{on board the}} tender saw the torpedo wake on Bridgeports port quarter. Orders came down for full left rudder and full speed ahead. Bridgeport swung barely out of harm's way as men on her stern {{observed}} the torpedo disappear {{on the port side}} and reappear to starboard. It passed five feet astern, barely clearing the rudder. The starboard battery fired one shot {{in the direction of the}} torpedo—which broached on the starboard quarter—while the port guns fired in the direction from which the torpedo had come. Meanwhile, two destroyers, with a number of subchasers, hurried toward the <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> torpedo wake had apparently begun and dropped depth charges. Bridgeport ceased fire and resumed her place in the formation. Through all this activity, no one actually saw the submarine that had fired the torpedo.|$|E
5|$|Lyle spots {{an unknown}} person {{running away from}} them in the subway and the team follows. When the group {{approaches}} the <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> train lost power, Melnick starts crying out in pain. Visible electrical flashes start destroying the skin on his left arm. Scully tells Doggett to pour water on it, which stops the flashes. Lyle takes the badly injured Melnick {{to the surface and}} Doggett continues onward with Bianco. When Melnick returns to the surface, he seems to be getting worse, but Lyle appears healthy. Scully then sees the three bodies being taken away by non-CDC hazmat people. When Scully confronts Karras about this, he says that he is organizing it. Scully tells Karras that she has already organized the CDC to collect the bodies and accuses Karras of attempting a cover-up. Although Karras tries to deny his involvement, he eventually allows her to send the bodies to the actual CDC.|$|E
25|$|The King {{proceeded}} {{and when}} he entered the Hall, he had difficulty in <b>spotting</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Buddha was. To his king's aid, Jivaka answered that the Buddha was sitting {{on the back of a}} pillar, surrounded by his disciples.|$|R
50|$|Dropout {{compensation}} (DOC): Replaced snowy video <b>spots</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> FM signal on {{the tape}} is missing momentary, caused by a defect in the tape. Optional on some models, both Ampex and 3M made different models of DOC modules for quad VTRs that can interface with such.|$|R
5000|$|A fumble going out-of-bounds {{between the}} end zones is {{retained}} by the last team with possession (in Canadian football, the last team to touch the ball). If the ball was moving backwards {{with regard to the}} recovering team, it is <b>spotted</b> <b>where</b> it went out of bounds. If the ball was moving forwards, it is <b>spotted</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> fumble occurred (the fumble itself cannot advance the ball).|$|R
5|$|On August 22, 1992, the 99th {{anniversary of}} Parker's birth, the United States Postal Service issued a 29¢ U.S. {{commemorative}} postage stamp in the Literary Arts series. The Algonquin Round Table, {{as well as the}} number of other literary and theatrical greats who lodged there, helped earn the Algonquin Hotel its status as a New York City Historic Landmark, designated in 1987. In 1996, the hotel was designated a National Literary Landmark by the Friends of Libraries USA based on the contributions of Parker {{and other members of the}} Round Table. The organization's bronze plaque is attached to the front of the hotel. Her birthplace was also designated a National Literary Landmark by Friends of Libraries USA in 2005 and a bronze plaque marks the <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> home once stood.|$|E
5|$|One month later, Jupiter {{visits the}} narrator and asks him to come immediately, fearing that Legrand has been bitten by the bug and gone insane. Once they arrive on the island, Legrand insists that the bug will {{be the key to}} {{restoring}} his lost fortune. He leads them on an expedition to a particular tree and has Jupiter climb it until he finds a skull nailed {{at the end of one}} branch. At Legrand's direction, Jupiter drops the bug through one eye socket and Legrand paces out to a <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> group begins to dig. Finding nothing there, Legrand has Jupiter climb the tree again and drop the bug through the skull's other eye; they choose a different spot to dig, this time finding two skeletons and a chest filled with gold coins and jewelry. They estimate the total value at $1.5 million, but even that figure proves to be below the actual worth when they eventually sell the items.|$|E
5|$|Taphonomy is {{the study}} of the {{processes}} an organism’s body undergoes after it dies, which includes a study of preservation, the cause of death, and the circumstances of burial. The large, monospecific assemblage of Hypacrosaurus stebingeri in Montana was interpreted as a group of dinosaurs that was killed by a volcanic ashfall. This assemblage is considered autochthonous, meaning that the remains are thought to have been buried on or near the same <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> individuals died. The variety of ages in this group supports that this was a biocoenosis- an actual life assemblage of animals. The cause of death in a volcanic ashfall is suffocation by the ash and by the gases released from volcanic eruptions. The preservation of this diverse group of dinosaurs provides researchers with a growth series, which is a sequence of growth stages from juvenile to adult.|$|E
50|$|The {{group of}} mounds and {{enclosures}} is located alongside Paint Creek. Today, {{most of the}} mounds and earthworks have been destroyed due to cultivation. Aerial photography has displayed cropmarks of the works. It has been noted that corn plants grow differently in <b>the</b> <b>spots</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> earthworks once stood.|$|R
50|$|The {{waters of}} much of the Liugongjun canal system still flow beneath the city streets, and there remain a few <b>spots</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> canal is exposed and visible, most notably at the {{northern}} end of Xinsheng North Road. There have been recent proposals to daylight sections of the canal.|$|R
50|$|The iDistance {{technique}} can {{be viewed}} as a way of accelerating the sequential scan. Instead of scanning records from the beginning to the end of the data file, the iDistance starts <b>the</b> scan from <b>spots</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> nearest neighbors can be obtained early with a very high probability.|$|R
5|$|The Stone has {{suffered}} repeated desecrations and damage {{over the course}} of time. It {{is said to have been}} struck and smashed to pieces by a stone fired from a catapult during the Umayyad Caliphate's siege of Mecca in 683. The fragments were rejoined by Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr using a silver ligament. In January 930, it was stolen by the Qarmatians, who carried the Black Stone away to their base in Hajar (modern Eastern Arabia). According to Ottoman historian Qutb al-Din, writing in 1857, the Qarmatian leader Abu Tahir al-Jannabi set the Black Stone up in his own mosque, the Masjid al-Dirar, with the intention of redirecting the hajj away from Mecca. However, this failed, and pilgrims continued to venerate the <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Black Stone had been.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{originally planned}} to film the teaser sequence at a Catholic hospital, but {{the hospital was}} reluctant to affix a faux gargoyle to the building. Thus, the shot was relocated to Heritage Hall, a noted filming location and former post office in Vancouver. Some last minute scrambling was required when city workmen tore up the sidewalk on the very <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> producers planned to film the scene. The construction crew reassured the show that the construction would be finished in time for filming. Indeed, the work was finished two hours before shooting of the episode started. Additional exterior shots were filmed at an alley near Bonanza Meat Market. The walls were painted to match those of Heritage Hall, although after filming was completed, they were returned to their original state.|$|E
5|$|Another steep climb of 800 feet {{brought us}} to the Marei Parei spur, to the <b>spot</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> ground was covered with the {{magnificent}} pitcher-plants, of which we had come in search. This one {{has been called the}} Nepenthes Rajah, and is a plant about four feet in length, with broad leaves stretching on every side, having the great pitchers resting on the ground in a circle about it. Their shape and size are remarkable. I will give the measurement of one, to indicate the form: the length along the back nearly fourteen inches; from the base {{to the top of the}} column in front, five inches; and its lid a foot long by fourteen inches broad, and of an oval shape. Its mouth was surrounded by a plaited pile, which near the column was two inches broad, lessening in its narrowest part to three-quarters of an inch. The plaited pile of the mouth was also undulating in broad waves. Near the stem the pitcher is four inches deep, so that the mouth is situated upon it in a triangular manner. The colour of an old chalice is a deep purple, but that of the others is generally mauve outside, very dark indeed in the lower part, though lighter towards the rim; the inside is of the same colour, but has a kind of glazed and shiny appearance. The lid is mauve in the centre, shading to green at the edges. The stems of the female flowers we found always a foot shorter than those of the male, and the former were far less numerous than the latter. It is indeed one of the most astonishing productions of nature.|$|E
