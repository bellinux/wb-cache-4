50|$|Based on the ionic radii {{and charge}} alone, Ni2+ should easily {{substitute}} for Mg2+ in octahedral coordination. The fact that Ni readily substitutes for Mg in garnierite explains why as NiO content goes up, MgO content goes down. The nickel in garnierite is not evenly {{distributed throughout the}} structure, but is concentrated in small zones of nickel surrounded by magnesium zones. Garnierite is a layer silicate. The main difference between the <b>serpentine-like</b> and talc-like variants of garnierite is the spacing between layers in the structure, seen in x-ray powder diffraction studies. The <b>serpentine-like</b> variants have 7 Å basal spacings while the talc-like variants have a basal spacing of 10 Å. At 106X magnifications, the 7 and 10 Å layer spacings (d(001)) are obvious and measureable, with the 7 Å spacings being better defined than the 10 Å spacings. 7 Å, <b>serpentine-like</b> minerals show rod and tube shaped particles, as well as platy particles and fluffy particles that are most likely aggregates while the 10 Å variety shows much less variation in particles, showing only platy and fluffy forms with very few tube or rod shaped particles. Some particles exhibit interstratification of 7 and 10 Å spacings. There is no correlation between NiO content and {{the shapes of the}} particles in the mineral. 7 Å type garnierites usually resemble chrysotile or lizardite in their structures, while 10 Å types usually resemble pimelite.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDetailed textural and mineralogical {{investigations}} {{carried out}} in mineralized veins of the New Caledonian peridotites reveal three major periods of infilling and alteration closely linked to post-obduction tectonic activity. The first two periods of infillings {{are related to the}} alteration of hydrothermal serpentines, mostly found in the thick serpentine network of the peridotites, into fine-grained <b>serpentine-like</b> residues and newly formed talc-like minerals of weak but variable swelling capacity. The alteration of serpentine into talc-like minerals is limited during the first period of infilling and almost completed during the second one. In some fault zones of the New Caledonian peridotites, talc-like minerals are replaced by sepiolite. Such alterations are reported in both the Ni-free and Ni-rich zones of the infillings (i. e. in the white `deweylite' and greenish `garnierite' of the fault zones, respectively). They led to the individualization of the hydrous Mg/Ni silicate ore, which is nowadays found in fractures of the saprock and saprolite units of thick lateritic profiles. The third and last period of infilling is assigned to the accumulation of silica and crystallization of quartz. This succession of clay minerals (<b>serpentine-like</b> and talc-like minerals, sepiolite) and quartz in the infillings is interpreted as the result of sequential exportation of Mg and redistribution of Ni along the reactivated faults, generating periods of increasing Si activity in solutions. In this paragenetic model, the meteoric water infiltrating repeatedly the permeable network created by post-obduction tectonic activity would have interacted with a low-temperature hydrothermal field following the exhumation and cooling of the ophiolite nappe. In the less permeable parts of the fault network, restricted leaching conditions would have generated greater alkalinity in solutions and therefore favored the crystallization of sepiolite instead of finely divided talc-like minerals...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{laterite}} nickel (Ni) ore smelting {{operation in}} Niquelândia (Goiás state, Brazil) produced {{large amounts of}} smelting wastes, stockpiled on dumps (slags) and in settling ponds (fly ash). In this study we present data on the chemistry, mineralogy and pH-dependent leaching behaviours of these two waste materials. Bulk chemical analyses indicated that both wastes contained significant amounts of potentially toxic elements (PTEs), with substantially higher concentrations {{in the case of}} the fly ash (up to 2. 51 wt% Ni, 1870 mg/kg Cr and 488 mg/kg Co). The mineralogical investigations carried out using X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron microprobe (EPMA) indicated that the slag was mainly composed of silicate glass, olivine and pyroxene. In contrast, the fly ash was composed of Ni-bearing <b>serpentine-like</b> phases (originating from the furnace feed), Ni-bearing glass, olivine, pyroxene and spinel. The pH-dependent leaching behaviour was performed according the EU standard experimental protocol (CEN/TS 14997) in the pH range of 3 – 12. The leaching was highly pH-dependent for both materials, and the highest releases of PTEs occurred at pH 3. The slag generally exhibited an U-shaped leaching behaviour of the PTEs as a function of pH, and was found to release up to 48. 0 mg/kg Ni, 25. 6 mg/kg Cr, and 1. 42 mg/kg Co. The fly ash was significantly more reactive, and exhibited its highest leaching level of PTEs between pH 3 and 7. The maximum observed release corresponded to 5750 mg/kg Ni, 4. 35 mg/kg Cr, and 112 mg/kg Co. The leached Ni concentrations after 24 h of leaching in deionized water exceeded the limit for hazardous waste by more than 100 x according to the EU legislation (40 mg/kg Ni). X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) and Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structures (EXAFS) spectra indicated that Ni in the fly ash is predominantly bound in a <b>serpentine-like</b> phase, and during the fly ash experimental alteration it was mainly released from the second shell (corresponding to the atomic distances between Ni and Si, Mg, Fe in high-temperature silicates, glass, and partially dissolved serpentine). This study shows that disposal sites for the fly ash can represent a significant source of local pollution, and direct recycling of the fly ash in the smelting technology (as currently adopted at the Barro Alto new smelter and since few years also at the Niquelândia smelter) is the best environment-friendly option for handling of fly ash in the future...|$|E

40|$|Shock {{recovery}} {{experiments in}} the 25 to 45 GPa range on antigorite serpentine {{determine the amount of}} shock-induced loss of structural water as a function of shock pressure. Infrared absorption spectra of shock recovered samples demonstrate systematic changes in the amount of structural water and molecular, surface adsorbed water. These yield qualitative estimates of shock-induced water loss and demonstrate that a portion of the shock released structural water is readsorbed on interfacial grain surfaces. Determination of the post-shock water content of the shocked samples relates shock-induced water loss and shock pressure. Based on the present results and theoretical predictions, we conclude that shock pressures of from 20 to ∼ 60 GPa induce incipient to complete water loss, respectively. This result agrees closely with theoretical estimates for total dehydration. The dehydration interval and the activation energies for dehydration in shocked samples decrease systematically with increasing shock pressure as experienced by the sample. We believe the present experiments are applicable to describing dehydration processes of <b>serpentine-like</b> minerals in the accretional environment of the terrestrial planets. We conclude that complete loss of structural water in serpentine could have occurred from accretional impacts of ∼ 3 km/sec when earth and Venus have grown to about 50 % of their final size.

40|$|International audienceA self-consistent {{theory of}} {{relatively}} thin anisotropic current sheets (TCS) in collisionless plasma is developed, {{taking into account}} the presence of a guiding field B y (all notations are used in the GSM coordinate system). TCS configurations with a finite value of guiding field B y are often observed in Earth's magnetotail and are typical for Earth's magnetopause. A characteristic signature of such configurations is the existence of a magnetic field component along the direction of TCS current. A general case is considered in this paper with global sheared magnetic field B y = const. Analytical and numerical (particle-in-cell) models for such plasma equilibria are analyzed and compared with each other as well as with Cluster observations. It is shown that, in contrast to the case with B y = 0, the character of ``particle-current sheet'' interaction is drastically changed {{in the case of a}} global magnetic shear. Specifically, <b>serpentine-like</b> parts of ion trajectories in the neutral plane become more tortuous, leading to a thicker current sheet. The reflection coefficient of particles coming from northern and southern sources also becomes asymmetric and depends upon the value of the B y component. As a result, the degree of asymmetry of magnetic field, plasma, and current density profiles appears characteristic of current sheets with a constant B y. In addition, in the presence of nonzero guiding field, the curvature current of electrons in the center of the current sheet decreases, yielding an effective thickening of the sheet. Implications of these results for current sheets in Earth's magnetosphere are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We discuss small-scale, helical, {{interstellar}} filaments on {{the basis}} of optical observations of an elephant trunk in the Rosette nebula. The trunk studied is composed of a number of sinusoidal or <b>serpentine-like</b> dark filaments, preferentially in the outer part of the trunk, where their wavelength is 7 – 9 times the trunk radius. The diameters are down to the limit of resolution of 1. 0 arcsec, corresponding to 1600 au, and ranging up to about 6400 au. At some positions filament crossings give rise to enhanced extinction. We suggest that the sinusoidal filaments are helices lined up by magnetic fields. We derive average extinctions of 0. 5 – 1. 0 mag in the filaments, implying molecular densities of nH 2 ≈ 10 4 cm − 3. From existing data on the Rosette H ii region, we conclude that the surrounding kinetic and dynamic pressure and the background radiation field suffice to balance even the denser filaments and to exert drag forces on the trunk as a whole, consistent with evidence of stretching of the trunk. The helical magnetic structures imply the presence of electric currents along the trunk axis. These currents should form a nearly force-free geometry and are consistent with a model consisting of 4 – 7 helical cables on the surface of a cylinder and which produce the observed wavelength of the helices. We suggest that the Rosette elephant trunks form an interconnected system of rope-like structures which are relics from filamentary skeletons of magnetic fields in the primordial cloud...|$|E
40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: To {{establish}} the occurrence, modulation and functional significance of compound exocytosis in insulin-secreting beta cells. METHODS: Exocytosis was monitored in rat beta cells by electrophysiological, biochemical and optical methods. The functional assays were complemented by three-dimensional reconstruction of confocal imaging, transmission and block face {{scanning electron microscopy}} to obtain ultrastructural evidence of compound exocytosis. RESULTS: Compound exocytosis contributed marginally (< 5 % of events) to exocytosis elicited by glucose/membrane depolarisation alone. However, in beta cells stimulated {{by a combination of}} glucose and the muscarinic agonist carbachol, 15 - 20 % of the release events were due to multivesicular exocytosis, but the frequency of exocytosis was not affected. The optical measurements suggest that carbachol should stimulate insulin secretion by ∼ 40 %, similar to the observed enhancement of glucose-induced insulin secretion. The effects of carbachol were mimicked by elevating [Ca(2 +) ](i) from 0. 2 to 2  μmol/l Ca(2 +). Two-photon sulforhodamine imaging revealed exocytotic events about fivefold larger than single vesicles and that these structures, once formed, could persist for tens of seconds. Cells exposed to carbachol for 30  s contained long (1 - 2  μm) <b>serpentine-like</b> membrane structures adjacent to the plasma membrane. Three-dimensional electron microscopy confirmed the existence of fused multigranular aggregates within the beta cell, the frequency of which increased about fourfold in response to stimulation with carbachol. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Although contributing marginally to glucose-induced insulin secretion, compound exocytosis becomes quantitatively significant under conditions associated with global elevation of cytoplasmic calcium. These findings suggest that compound exocytosis is a major contributor to the augmentation of glucose-induced insulin secretion by muscarinic receptor activation...|$|E
40|$|Geochemical {{data are}} {{presented}} for the kimberlitic Holocene Igwisi Hills volcanoes (IHV), Tanzania, which preserve extra-crater lavas and pyroclastic rocks. Their young age and exceptional preservation enable investigation of kimberlite magma compositions and alteration pathways of kimberlites. The IHV lavas have a variable matrix assemblage dominated by calcite, olivine and a <b>serpentine-like</b> mineral (termed serpentine-X). Minor primary groundmass phases include apatite, phlogopite, monticellite, perovskite and spinel representing late-stage crystalisation. Secondary phases include hydrogarnet, a mixed-layer chlorite-vermiculite-montmorrilonite, minor brucite and low-temperature oxides and clays such as goethite and jamborite. The matrix of pyroclastic rocks {{is dominated by}} calcite with fewer groundmass phases. The parental magmas are inferred to have had ~ 21 wt % SiO 2, ~ 22 wt % CaO, ~ 23 wt % MgO and Mg# ~ 70. The IHV are classified as calcite kimberlites. The total volatile concentrations of the primary melt are ~ 14 wt %, which predominantly consists of CO 2 although the H 2 O content is also high. Whole-rock geochemical analyses indicate minor crustal contamination, low-temperature alteration and weathering. Pervasive serpentinisation in both lavas and pyroclastic rocks results from low-temperature alteration induced by the circulation of meteoric waters during cooling. Serpentine-X is potentially a new mineral and is richer in Al 2 O 3 and FeO and poorer in SiO 2 than published analyses of serpentine minerals. These compositions are attributed to a 1 : 2 mixture of serpentine and hydrotalcite. We propose that serpentine-X has replaced a reactive, late stage residual silicate glass, the existence of which helps explain the presence of vesicular scoria (similar to glassy basaltic pyroclasts) and viscous kimberlite lavas...|$|E
40|$|To {{establish}} the occurrence, modulation and functional significance of compound exocytosis in insulin-secreting beta cells. Exocytosis was monitored in rat beta cells by electrophysiological, biochemical and optical methods. The functional assays were complemented by three-dimensional reconstruction of confocal imaging, transmission and block face {{scanning electron microscopy}} to obtain ultrastructural evidence of compound exocytosis. Compound exocytosis contributed marginally (< 5 % of events) to exocytosis elicited by glucose/membrane depolarisation alone. However, in beta cells stimulated {{by a combination of}} glucose and the muscarinic agonist carbachol, 15 - 20 % of the release events were due to multivesicular exocytosis, but the frequency of exocytosis was not affected. The optical measurements suggest that carbachol should stimulate insulin secretion by similar to 40 %, similar to the observed enhancement of glucose-induced insulin secretion. The effects of carbachol were mimicked by elevating [Ca 2 +](i) from 0. 2 to 2 mu mol/l Ca 2 +. Two-photon sulforhodamine imaging revealed exocytotic events about fivefold larger than single vesicles and that these structures, once formed, could persist for tens of seconds. Cells exposed to carbachol for 30 s contained long (1 - 2 mu m) <b>serpentine-like</b> membrane structures adjacent to the plasma membrane. Three-dimensional electron microscopy confirmed the existence of fused multigranular aggregates within the beta cell, the frequency of which increased about fourfold in response to stimulation with carbachol.
