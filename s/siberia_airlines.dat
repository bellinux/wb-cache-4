50|$|Though the {{military}} was well equipped it still experienced lack of funds particularly for training and exercises, {{which led to a}} number of incidents with one notable one being the <b>Siberia</b> <b>Airlines</b> Flight 1812 of 2001 the other Sknyliv airshow disaster of 2002. Still the Armed Forces effectiveness was demonstrated during the Tuzla Island Conflict - when (brief description). In 2003 Ukraine completed its first set of reforms which were judged largely successful, with the personnel numbers stabilizing at 295,000 of which 90,000 were civilian contractors.|$|E

Nagayeva's brother had disappeared three years earlier and the family believed he was abducted by Russian forces. Chechen field commander Shamil Basayev took responsibility for the bombings in an open letter published on the Chechen separatists' websites on 17 September 2004. He claimed that the aircraft bombings cost him US$4,000 in total. He has also denied the Islambouli Brigade's claims.|$|E

According to an unnamed government source of the Russian news agency Interfax, the plane had broadcast a hijack warning while flying over Rostov Oblast at 22:59. The plane disappeared from radar screens shortly after that and crashed. 38 passengers and 8 crew members were on board the plane, {{and there were no}} survivors after the crash. The debris of the aircraft was found on the morning of 25 August 2004, 9 km from the work settlement of Gluboky in Kamensky District of Rostov Oblast.|$|E
50|$|Profitable until 1997, Armenian Airlines began {{a decline}} in 1998 which {{executive}} director Arsen Avetisian blamed on the 1998 Russian financial crisis. Additionally, technical problems with its sole Airbus A310 helped lead the company towards financial problems. The company began to join forces with Belgian operator VG Airlines (later renamed Delsey Airlines); but the Belgian carrier had to file for bankruptcy on November 5, 2002. Armenian Airlines {{was reported to be}} looking for cooperation with Armenian International Airways to continue or restart its flights into Europe. When Armavia (which was owned by <b>Siberia</b> <b>Airlines)</b> entered into an agreement with the Armenian government and was granted most of Armenian Airlines' flight rights, including the lucrative Yerevan to Moscow route, Armenian Airlines was unable to recover, and officially declared bankruptcy on April 15, 2003.|$|E
50|$|<b>Siberia</b> <b>Airlines</b> Flight 1812 was a {{commercial}} flight {{shot down by}} the Ukrainian Air Force over the Black Sea on 4 October 2001, en route from Tel Aviv, Israel to Novosibirsk, Russia. The aircraft, a Soviet-made Tupolev Tu-154, carried an estimated 66 passengers and 12 crew members. Most of the passengers were Israelis visiting relatives in Russia. There were no survivors. The crash site is about 190 km west-southwest of the Black Sea resort of Sochi and 140 km north of the Turkish coastal town of Fatsa and 350 km south-southeast of Feodosiya in Crimea. The accident {{took place at the}} time of the combat missile launches during the joint Ukrainian-Russian military air defense exercises. The exercises were held at the Russian-controlled training ground of the 31st Russian Black Sea Fleet Research center on Opuk cape near the city of Kerch (Crimea). Ukraine eventually admitted that it caused the crash, probably by an errant S-200 missile fired by its armed forces. Ukraine ended up paying $15 million to surviving family members of 78 victims ($200,000 per victim).|$|E
40|$|We use an instanton {{approximation}} to the continuous-time spin coherentstate path {{integral to}} obtain the tunnel splitting of classically degenerate ground states. We show that provided the fluctuation determinant is carefully evaluated, the path integral expression is accurate to order O(1 /j). We apply the method to the LMG model and to the molecular magnet Fe 8 in a transverse field. This paper {{is dedicated to the}} memory of Victor Belinicher, who was lost when <b>Siberia</b> <b>Airlines</b> flight 1812 was shot down over the Black Sea, Oct 4 th 2001.
