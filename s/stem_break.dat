40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} is to study the internal water relations,of ageing Gerbera inflorescences and their consequence on keepingquality of cut inflorescences. As {{in all parts of}} this paper, the term "flower" will be used to describe an inflorescence with its supporting stem. A great problem during vase-life of cut Gerbera flowers is ',stem break", a sudden bending of the stem. As described in part 1, this phenomenon was caused by a water shortage in the flower. The water-stress was a result of a decline of the absorption rate, due to an increase of the resistance to the water flow between the vase and the petals. In roses (which show a similar phenomenon) a water deficit in the flower-neck occurs because of competition between the various organs when the water supply is limiting (Zieslin et al., 1978). Also in the Gerbera flower {{there seems to be a}} competition for the available water, between flower head and stem. The increase in flow resistance causing <b>stem</b> <b>break,</b> was a result of microbial activity in the vase water. "Stem-plugging" by bacteria can be considerable already after 2 days for many flower species (Aarts, 1957). Silver-ions can extend keeping-quality of cut carnation flowers by their anti-ethylene effect (Halevy and Kofranek, 1977; Veen and Van de Geijn, 1978). However, the prevention of <b>stem</b> <b>break</b> by silver nitrate in the vase water is related to its bactericidal effect, as the mobility of silver supplemented as silver nitrate, is very low in flower stew (Veen and Van de Geijn, 1978; Nowak, 1979). Moreover, a pretreatment (1 - 24 h) of Gerbera stems with silver nitrate does not counteract the detrimental effect of etephon (Nowak, 1979). Mayak et al. (1977) demonstrated, that a pretreatment of the carnation stem with silver nitrate reduced the microbial population of the vase solution by the release of silver from the impregnated stem. They found that another important beneficial effect of such a pretreatment of the stem base is to decrease the toxic effect of metabolites produced by bacteria. So, the use of silver nitrate as a short pretreatment immediately after cutting will have advantages above other bactericides. There are 2 different pathways for water uptake by a Gerbera stem: a direct one through the xylem vessels at the cut surface and an indirect one through the cavity in the stem. Only the direct water uptake is strongly inhibited by bacterial activity in the vase water. <b>Stem</b> <b>break</b> can be prevented therefore without the use of chemicals by cutting the stem through the cavity in its center. The beneficial effect of this treatment could be improved by making a small hole in the stem as an air outlet from thecavity, together with a high water level in the vase in order to promote the rise of water inside the cavity. Stem stiffness consists of the strength from turgor of the cells and that of the structural elements. Gerbera cultivars with structurally strong stew do not show the phenomenon of <b>stem</b> <b>break</b> when a water deficit develops (De Jong, 1978). Breeding for flowers with structurally strong stems only will prevent <b>stem</b> <b>break,</b> however, not the water stress caused by microbial activity in the vase water. It is worthwhile therefore to select flowers not only with a structural strong stem, but also with a hollow one all the year round from an early stage of development. When Gerbera flowers were placed in water with silver nitrate, there was. still a gradual increase in the resistance for water flow through the stem ("physiological plugging") causing a decrease of water potential of the petals (part II). This decrease of petal water potential, however, was not accompanied by <b>stem</b> <b>break.</b> Possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy are discussed in detail in part II. The calculated resistance of the flower stem was obtained without induced pressure differences between 2 sides of a cut stem piece, so the results could not be due to artifacts caused by artificial pressures as suggested by Carpenter and Rasmussen (1973) for roses. The physiological plugging could be prevented by a constant low pH of the vase water. Even when the stem resistance for water flow remained constant at a low pH, water absorption of the cv. 'Wageningen Rood' became lower than transpiration after 5 days, resulting in a decrease of flower fresh weight and petal water content (as a percentage of dry weight and as relative water content). The water potential of the petals, however,' remained steady, which seems a rather conflicting result. It should be realised, that the pressure chamber method used for estimating petal water potential, actually measures the non-osmotic component of the xylem water potential. As there ate no semi-permeable membranes between petal xylem elements and vase water, it is an accurate value for calculating stem flow resistance, but not for the actual water potential of the petal cells. This problem is discussed in more detail later on. Ageing petals of cut Gerbera flowers without stem plugging (part Ill) showed that the water content (W. C.) as a percentage of dry weight was correlated with ion leakage (I. L.) and with petal dry weight (D. W.) as given by the formula: W. C. = a + b(I. L.) - c(I. L.) 2 - d(D. W.). The increase in W. C. during the first days of vase life of cut flowers was due to a decrease of dry weight, while the sudden decrease in W. C. after some days of vase life was correlated with an increase in I. L., indicating a change in the semi- permeability of the membranes. Flowers ageing on the plant did not show the sharp decrease of W. C., whereas also the increase of I. L. was absent. The date at which I. L. of cut flowers increased depended on the cultivar and was affected by temperature and cytokinin treatments. The influence of temperature on the onset of the decrease of W. C. and increase of I. L. showed the importance for keeping-quality of a low temperature during storage and transport of the flowers. In part IV is demonstrated that the internal water relations of ageing petal-tissue were influenced to a large extent when flowers were separated from the plant. Sap osmotic potential (ψ osm) of petals of cut flowers cv. 'Wageningen Rood' increased the first 6 days of vase life, followed by a decrease. Pressure potential (ψ press) decreased during the entire vase period. When flowers were left on the plant, ψ osm was steady during the first 6 days and increased thereafter, whereas ψ press was steady until day 6 and then decreased. This different behaviour of the various components of water potential was due to the increase of ion leakage of petal cells of ageing cut flowers, whereas ion leakage remained constant when flowers were ageing on the plant. An increase of ion leakage of petal cells will decrease the osmotic potential of the xylem fluid of the petals. This change in xylem osmotic potential will not influence the potential difference between vase water and petal cells and thus absorption rate of vase water. However, it will decrease the water potential of the petal cells and therefore water content, osmotic potential and pressure Potential. The increase of ion concentration of the xylem fluid of the petals will cause a water shortage in the petal cells, even when these cells still act as good osmometers. Comparison of the results with literature data are difficult because of different measuring techniques and experimental circumstances. Mayak et al. (1974) using an isopiestic method, found a decline of petal water potential after 6 days with roses. However, they demonstrated an increase in stem water flow resistance when the flowers aged. Osmotic values of ageing carnation petals as given by Mayak et al. (1978) are conflicting with that given by Acock and Nichols (1979). Changes in ion leakage from the petal cells dominate the petal water relations of cut Gerbera flowers as discussed already previously. To obtain a better understanding of factors involved in keeping-quality of cut flowers, it will be important to know more about the triggering processes inducing the changes in ion leakage. Some experiments in this aspect are described in parts V and VI. It is known for many plant 'species that root-synthesized cytokinins are transported to the shoots, while ageing of leaves is hastend by excising and retarded by exogenous cytokinins. Moreover, ageing of cut flowers can be retarded by application of cytokinins. Therefore, experiments were done to investigate if differences in ion leakage between Gerbera petals of flowers ageing in a vase and on the plant could be ascribed to differences in cytokinin activities (part V). Cytokinin activities in petal-extracts of 3 cultivars, differing in their keeping-quality, were also compared. Activities decreased when the flowers aged (except on day 8 of the experiment). However, there were no differences between flowers ageing in a vase or on the plant. With the 3 cultivars used, there was no correlation between cytokinin content of petals at day of harvest and their keeping-quality. The results suggest strongly that no correlation exists between cytokinin activities of Gerbera petal cells and changes in their ion leakage. From the data given in part VI, it is concluded that changes in pressure potential of Gerbera petal cells can induce changes in the leakage of ions from the cells. The positive results of "pulsing" flowers, either with sugar (Kohl and Rundle, 1972; Mayak et al., 1973; Nichols, 1974; Sacalis and Chin, 1976) or mineral salts (Halevy, 1976), could also be a result of enhancing the pressure potential of the petal cells. Carnation flowers grown under dry conditions kept longer than those grown under moist irrigation regime (Hanan and Jasper, 1969; Mayak and Kofranek, 1976). It is likely, that the "dry grown" flowers have a higher pressure potential at the same water potential, than the "moist grown" flowers, as was found with leaves of plants grown in culture solutions with different osmotic potential (Jarvis and Jarvis, 1963). For the 3 Gerbera cultivars used, there was a correlation between their keeping-quality and their pressure potential at day of harvest. When a decrease of pressure potential initiates an increase of ion leakage, and subsequently causes a decrease of water content, the process of ageing will accelerate itself, once it has began. There seems to be a discrepancy between the conclusion that pressure potential of petal cells influences ion leakage of the cells and the data in Fig. 4 of part III where induced changes of water content did not influence ion leakage. The changes in water content in part III, however, were induced within 24 h, while the results in part VI were obtained when pressure potential was influenced during some days. The dominant influence of ion leakage on water relations, as demonstrated in parts III and IV, and the results of part VI suggest strongly that keeping pressure potential of flower petals above a certain level will be very important for a good keeping-quality of cut flowers. It might be possible that pressure potential at day of harvest, can be a selection criterion for potential keeping-quality of cut flowers. ...|$|E

40|$|Modern {{silviculture}} {{is shifting}} from even-aged management toward sustainable {{management of the}} diversity of forest communities. Traditional growth-and-yield models are too simple for this new approach, but mechanistic models that can incorporate the complexity are too general. This shift in emphasis presents important scientific challenges and creates a critical need to update our modeling approaches. ^ One response has been to manage forests by mimicking natural disturbance. Windstorm is the dominant natural disturbance in forests of northeastern North America. In Chapter 1, I use a mechanistic model (SORTIE) to explore the sensitivity of forest composition and structure to the resistance of individual trees to wind disturbance and the roles of local dispersal and seedling establishment. The results show that species-specific resistance to wind: drives the community response to disturbance; interacts with local dispersal patterns to influence succession; and interacts with seedbed substrate dynamics to influence canopy population dynamics. ^ Biotic disturbances are also an important natural disturbance in these forests. In Chapter 2, I quantify how the presence of beech bark disease (BBD) alters the resistance of beech to uprooting and <b>stem</b> <b>break,</b> and explore the sensitivity of forests to subsequent increases in coarse woody debris (CWD). Results show that small seeded species increased in basal area primarily due to the increase in CWD caused by BBD. The results highlight the important indirect effects that pathogens can have on forest community dynamics. ^ Managing complexity also requires improving our understanding of competition among trees and species responses along environmental gradients. In Chapter 3, I use USFS FIA data to analyze the effects of competition on tree growth along gradients for eight tree species in New England. I use information theory to determine the relative weight of evidence for each model. No species showed strong evidence in support of one model over others, implying that the robustness of predictions based on the selected best model is questionable. The complexity of competitive interactions and growth along gradients and the importance of including secondary effects via model averaging highlight key challenges for the management of mixed-species, uneven-aged stands. ...|$|E

We present observations of adjustments in the physical characteristics and biomechanical properties of S. erectum during the growing season (April–November) from the River Blackwater, UK. When a pulling device is attached to plant stems to measure their resistance to uprooting, individual plants show remarkable strength in their above- and below-ground biomass (median stem strength when <b>stems</b> <b>break</b> away from the underground biomass, 78 N, median rhizome strength, 39 N) and high resistance to uprooting (median uprooting resistance when entire plants uproot, 114 N). This provides the potential for the species to protect and reinforce the generally soft, silty sediments that it often retains and within which its rhizomes and roots develop in lower energy river environments. There is a propensity for plant <b>stems</b> to <b>break</b> before the plant is uprooted {{at the beginning and end}} of the growth season, but for the stems to have sufficient strength in mid season for plant uprooting to dominate. This ensures that rhizome and root systems remain relatively undisturbed at times when the silty sediments in which they grow are poorly protected by above-ground biomass. In contrast, rhizome strength remains comparatively invariant through the growing season, supporting the plant's potential to have a protective/reinforcing effect on fine sediments through the winter when above ground biomass is absent...|$|R

30|$|The stem {{strength}} of cereal plants is primarily determined by plant architecture (morphological traits and anatomical structure). In particular, anatomical structure {{is a consequence}} of plant growth and development at the cellular level, such as cell division, cell growth and cell spatial arrangement, and is closely related to environmental factors (Huber et al., 2013). In maize, a shading condition induces a reduction in the thickness of the mechanical tissue, the number of vascular bundles and the area of the xylem and phloem, which {{can be attributed to the}} weak mechanical strength of the stem (Cui et al., 2012). The response in plant architecture of wheat to high planting density is characterized by a longer and slender stem with low-density tissue, resulting in poor lodging resistance (Zheng et al., 2013).

However, Dunn and Briggs (1989) and Kelbert et al. (2004) argue that among barley and wheat cultivars, the thickness of sclerenchyma tissue is not associated with a difference in lodging resistance.|$|R

In the resulting five environments per year, deseases (powdery mildew, leaf rust, scald and net blotch), morphology related traits (stem lengh, ear braking, <b>stem</b> <b>breaking</b> and lodging), development related traits (time of heading and time of ripening) and yield related traits (kernel yiedl, kernel weight, kernel density, kernel size, starch and protein content) were observed. for the marker study, we used 65 polymorphic microsatellite markers distributed over all seven barley chromosomes. In the association analysis we applied a GLM analysis in the software TASSE and accepted only association with an error probability lower than 10 - 5. Beside for ear breaking, we found significant associations for each of the traits observed and always on more than one chromosome. The major part of the associations differed from 2002 to 2003. For the disease resistances and the kernel weight, we observed a relative high stability of the associated marker loci over the years, even so the barley lines on the field experiments differed partially from one year to the other. Surprisingly, we fond the best stability of association comparing the two years for the trait "kernel yield". Further analysis, especially in relation to G x E interaction and the influence of organic/conventional conditions will be published in an upcoming paper...|$|R

40|$|Oilseed radish is {{a unique}} cover crop that farmers are {{planting}} to improve their soil quality for economic crop production. It {{has the ability to}} recycle soil nutrients, suppress weeds and pathogens, break up compaction, reduce soil erosion, and produce large amounts of biomass. Freezing temperatures of 20 to 25 degrees will kill oilseed radish which allows for successful no-till spring planting of subsequent crops. As a fast growing, cool season cover crop, oilseed radish is best utilized when planted after small grain (e. g. wheat) or corn silage harvest. Excess nutrients in manure amended soil are rapidly absorbed by this cover crop, thus preventing leaching or runoff of nutrients into water systems.

40|$|Abstract Background Cost-efficient {{generation}} of second-generation biofuels requires plant biomass {{that can easily}} be degraded into sugars and further fermented into fuels. However, lignocellulosic biomass is inherently recalcitrant toward deconstruction technologies due to the abundant lignin and cross-linked hemicelluloses. Furthermore, lignocellulosic biomass has a high content of pentoses, which {{are more difficult to}} ferment into fuels than hexoses. Engineered plants with decreased amounts of xylan in their secondary walls have the potential to render plant biomass a more desirable feedstock for biofuel production. Results Xylan is the major non-cellulosic polysaccharide in secondary cell walls, and the xylan deficient irregular xylem (irx) mutants irx 7, irx 8 and irx 9 exhibit severe dwarf growth phenotypes. The main reason for the growth phenotype appears to be xylem vessel collapse and the resulting impaired transport of water and nutrients. We developed a xylan-engineering approach to reintroduce xylan biosynthesis specifically into the xylem vessels in the Arabidopsis irx 7, irx 8 and irx 9 mutant backgrounds by driving the expression of the respective glycosyltransferases with the vessel-specific promoters of the VND 6 and VND 7 transcription factor genes. The growth phenotype, <b>stem</b> <b>breaking</b> strength, and irx morphology was recovered to varying degrees. Some of the plants even exhibited increased stem strength compared to the wild type. We obtained Arabidopsis plants with up to 23 % reduction in xylose levels and 18 % reduction in lignin content compared to wild-type plants, while exhibiting wild-type growth patterns and morphology, as well as normal xylem vessels. These plants showed a 42 % increase in saccharification yield after hot water pretreatment. The VND 7 promoter yielded a more complete complementation of the irx phenotype than the VND 6 promoter. Conclusions Spatial and temporal deposition of xylan in the secondary cell wall of Arabidopsis can be manipulated by using the promoter regions of vessel-specific genes to express xylan biosynthetic genes. The expression of xylan specifically in the xylem vessels is sufficient to complement the irx phenotype of xylan deficient mutants, while maintaining low overall amounts of xylan and lignin in the cell wall. This engineering approach has the potential to yield bioenergy crop plants that are more easily deconstructed and fermented into biofuels. </p...|$|R
40|$|Saddle gall midge, Haplodiplosis marginata (von Roser) is a {{univoltine}} pest of cereals {{which occurs}} in Europe. The larvae overwinter in the soil. During the spring, the new emerged females lay eggs on {{the leaves of}} cereals and grasses. After hatching, larvae migrate under the leaf sheath, where they develop {{at the expense of}} the plant. As a reaction, stems induce saddle-shaped galls of 5 to 10 mm long. Numerous galls can lead to <b>stem</b> <b>breaks</b> and important yield losses when they are numerous. After 40 years without any reporting, large populations of H. marginata and important damage have been observed since 2010 in wheat crops in Belgium, especially in the Flemish Polders where clay soils and intensive farming of cereals favour heavy infestations. According to some research conducted in the 60 s during the last outbreak, oat (Avena sativa L.) is known to be one of the less attractive hosts to the saddle gall midge. Our study was thus performed in order to assess the host sensitivity of three oat varieties currently grown in Belgium (Evita, Effektiv and Freddy). Therefore, oat varieties were sown on infested ground in two separate enclosures in a glasshouse. In the first enclosure, only the three oat varieties were grown; in the second one, these three oat varieties were grown together with two varieties of spring wheat (Granny and KWS Chamsin). Two parameters were measured: the percentage of leaves with laid eggs, and the number of galls per stem. The percentage of leaves with eggs showed that the infestation is significantly lower on oats when they are in presence of wheat. The infestation was also significantly higher on wheat than on oat, which means oat is a much less favoured host plant than spring wheat for laying. Oat varieties were significantly different regarding the number of galls per stem, but with very little damage compared to wheat. The Freddy variety even seemed to be completely resistant to saddle gall midge, as no galls were observed although there were a similar percentage of leaves with eggs for the three oat varieties. Cropping oat could thus contribute to reduce or even to eliminate infestations of H. marginata...|$|R

We applied the ARDL bounds testing approach by incorporating structural <b>breaks</b> <b>stemming</b> in the series. The order of integration of the variables is examined by applying structural break unit root test. Our empirical exercise indicated that long run relationship between financial deepening, economic growth and poverty reduction exists in case of Pakistan.

40|$|From {{a review}} of the {{literature}} it was found that the failures of trees resulted from either uprooting or <b>stem</b> <b>breaking,</b> though many factors contribute to the health and continual growth that combats failure. Most of the literature cited wind as the main reason for failure, and it was found that there was a general lack of research and knowledge on common varieties of Eucalyptus trees, such as Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus rubida. There were currently no published results on the E. rubida mechanical properties, while only a few publications existed on E. camaldulensis. Recent studies have shown that concern was growing about the failure of trees, especially those in close proximity to cities and urban development with potential wind speeds increasing due to global warming. In order to investigate a means of obtaining material properties from living trees (via small core samples rather than the industry-standard method of bending tests from felled timber) the use of a relatively new instrument was investigated; the &ldquo;Fractometer II&rdquo;. It was found that it could potentially complement the industry standard method of testing, because the MOR for E. camaldulensis did not significantly differ between either testing methods, meaning that either method would yield valid results. E. camaldulensis and E. rubida were found to be significantly different to each other in their MOR values, thus it was recommended that Eucalypts be studied at the species level. It was found that the MOE for E. camaldulensis was 11. 1 Gpa, which was similar to other studies. Parameters such as tree shape, DBH, crown area, material properties and drag coefficient were estimated or measured for E. camaldulensis and E. rubida and these were used to predict the critical wind speed for stem breakage. The critical wind speeds were an estimation of the expected critical wind speeds for individual Eucalypt trees. Accelerometers were attached to several trees during heavy wind storms. Five sets of data from the accelerometers were used to calculate the displacement for each tree over an interval of thirty-nine seconds and then calculate the drag coefficient. From the method used to estimate drag coefficients, a high range of values were found (from 0. 670 - 0. 915) for E. camaldulensis. The critical wind speeds ranged from 37. 6 - 111 m/s for stem breakage, which was within the range expected from historical data on fallen trees in Victoria...|$|R
