50|$|Scallops {{and file}} clams can swim by {{opening and closing}} their valves rapidly by alternatingly {{contracting}} and relaxing their adductor muscles; water is ejected {{on either side of}} the hinge area and they move <b>with</b> the <b>flapping</b> <b>valves</b> in front.|$|R
50|$|Water {{will always}} try to find its lowest level. Using this principle, very simple pumps with plastic or rubber bulb <b>with</b> <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> at each end are used for {{emptying}} fuel or water cans into tanks. Once the bulb is full, the fluid will flow without further effort from the higher to the lower container. Many hand pumps will allow the passage of fluid through them {{in the direction of}} flow and diaphragm pumps are particularly good at this. Thus where the levels are correct large volumes of liquid such as swimming pools can be emptied with very little effort and no expensive energy use.|$|R
5000|$|Attempts at man-powered flight still persisted. Paucton's {{rotorcraft}} was man-powered, {{while another}} approach, also originally studied by da Vinci, {{was the use}} of <b>flap</b> <b>valves.</b> The <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> is a simple hinged flap over a hole in the wing. In one direction it opens to allow air through and in the other it closes to allow an increased pressure difference. An early example was designed by Bauer in 1764. Later in 1808, Jacob Degen built an ornithopter <b>with</b> <b>flap</b> <b>valves,</b> in which the pilot stood on a rigid frame and worked the wings with a movable horizontal bar. His 1809 attempt at flight failed, so he then added a small hydrogen balloon and the combination achieved some short hops. Popular illustrations of the day depicted his machine without the balloon, leading to confusion as to what had actually flown. In 1811, Albrecht Berblinger built an ornithopter based on Degen's design but omitted the balloon, plunging instead into the Danube. The fiasco did have an upside: George Cayley, also taken in by the illustrations, was spurred to publish his findings to date [...] "for the sake of giving a little more dignity to a subject bordering upon the ludicrous in public estimation", and the modern era of aviation was born.|$|R

When a Pacific razor clam (Siliqua patula) is laid {{on the surface of}} the beach it can bury itself completely in seven seconds [...] and the Atlantic jackknife clam, Ensis directus, can do the same within fifteen seconds. Scallops and file clams can swim by opening and closing their valves rapidly; water is ejected on either side of the hinge area and they move <b>with</b> the <b>flapping</b> <b>valves</b> in front. Scallops have simple eyes around the margin of the mantle and can clap their valves shut to move sharply, hinge first, to escape from danger. Cockles can use their foot to move across the seabed or leap away from threats. The foot is first extended before being contracted suddenly when it acts like a spring, projecting the animal forwards.|$|R
50|$|The Magdeburg hemispheres are a pair {{of large}} copper hemispheres, with mating rims. They were used to {{demonstrate}} the power of atmospheric pressure. When the rims were sealed with grease {{and the air was}} pumped out, the sphere contained a vacuum and could not be pulled apart by teams of horses. The Magdeburg hemispheres were designed by a German scientist and mayor of Magdeburg, Otto von Guericke, to demonstrate the air pump that he had invented, and the concept of atmospheric pressure. The first artificial vacuum had been produced a few years earlier by Evangelista Torricelli, and had inspired Guericke to design the world's first vacuum pump, which consisted of a piston and cylinder <b>with</b> one-way <b>flap</b> <b>valves.</b> The hemispheres became popular in physics lectures as an illustration of the strength of air pressure, and are still used in education.

40|$|Purpose: This article aims to {{describe}} the design of an anti-reflux ureteral stent <b>with</b> a polymeric <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> and the fabrication methods using three-dimensional (3 D) printing. The stent effectively prevents backward flow with a negligible reduction in forward flow. Fabrication of miniaturized valves was easy with high precision and rapid prototyping. Materials and Methods: The proposed stent comprised a 7 F Double-J (DJ) stent and a polymeric <b>flap</b> <b>valve.</b> The valve was made of Tango Plus FLX 980 and was fabricated using a 3 D printer. Two types of stent were prepared for in vitro tests: DJ stents with (1) an uncoated valve (UCV) stent and (2) a parylene C coated valve (PCV) stent for enhanced biocompatibility. The flow characteristics of each stent were evaluated considering flow direction, parylene coating, and stent side holes, and were compared to the intact DJ stent. Results: The forward flow rate for the distal portion of the UCV and PCV stents was 9. 8 mL/min and 7. 8 mL/min at applied pressure of 15 cm H 2 O (normal anterograde pressure in patients with stents), respectively. Backward flow rate for the distal portion of the UCV and PCV stents was decreased by 28 times and 8 times at applied pressure of 50 cm H 2 O (maximum bladder pressure), respectively, compared with the distal portion of the intact DJ stent. Forward flow rates of whole stents were 22. 2 mL/min (UCV stent) and 20. 0 mL/min (PCV stent) at applied pressure of 15 cm H 2 O, and backward flow rates of whole UCV and PCV stents were decreased by 8. 3 times and 4. 0 times at applied pressure of 50 cm H 2 O, respectively, compared with the intact DJ stent. Conclusions: The anti-reflux ureteral stent was successfully designed and fabricated using a 3 D printer. In vitro studies showed that the stent effectively prevented backward flow while minimizing reduction in forward flow.

40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out in 15 normal {{subjects}} and 14 patients with idiopathic faecal incontinence to test whether a rectoanal <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> could be responsible for maintaining faecal continence in man. Intraluminal pressures were recorded from the rectum and from three sites in the anal canal during serial increases in intra-abdominal pressure, produced by forced expiration into a sphygmomanometer keeping {{the height of the}} column of mercury at prescribed levels. The anal pressures in the normal volunteers always remained higher than the intrarectal pressures even when these were as high as 230 cm H 2 O. This pressure gradient was the reverse of that which would be found if an anterior rectal <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> maintained continence and suggests instead that continence is normally maintained by a reflex contraction of the external anal sphincter. The anal pressures in patients with idiopathic faecal incontinence, however, fell below the rectal pressure as the intra-abdominal pressure increased, creating the conditions for a <b>flap</b> <b>valve.</b> The valve was incompetent, however, because fluid infused into the rectum leaked from the anus whenever the rectal pressure exceeded the anal pressure...|$|R

Methods These studies were performed in open-chest, mongrel dogs anesthetized with morphine and pentobarbital, and maintained on intratracheal positive pressure respiration. After anticoagula-tion with heparin, a Morawitz cannula with an occlusive balloon-tip was placed in the orifice of the coronary sinus via the right atrial appendage, and its outflow was diverted via a long (2 m) external circuit to a previously cannulated left external jugular vein. A short segment of the right carotid artery was excised and replaced by a T cannula <b>with</b> a one-way <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> at its central end. This valve allowed blood to flow from the aorta into an overhead reservoir from which blood was re-turned to the animal through the cephalic seg-ment of the interrupted carotid artery. With this arrangement blood returned to the animal from the reservoir via the cerebral circulation rather than draining directly back into the aorta. After the valve was in place the aorta was ligated distal to the left subclavian artery and blood was di-verted into the overhead reservoir, the height of which was adjusted to maintain a mean aortic pressure of 100 mm Hg.

40|$|Background {{and study}} aims: The {{pathogenesis}} of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is multifactorial, including the mechanical anti-reflux barrier of the gastroesophageal junction. This barrier can be evaluated endoscopically in two ways: {{by measuring the}} axial length of any hiatal hernia present or by assessing the gastroesophageal <b>flap</b> <b>valve.</b> The endoscopic measurement of axial length is troublesome because of the physiological dynamics in the area. Grading the gastroesophageal <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> is easier and has proven reproducible. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare the two endoscopic grading methods with regard to associations with GERD. Patients and methods: Population-based subjects underwent endoscopic examination assessing the axial length of hiatus hernia, the gastroesophageal <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> using the Hill classification, esophagitis using the Los Angeles (LA) classification, and columnar metaplasia using the Z-line appearance (ZAP) classification. Biopsies were taken from the squamocolumnar junction to assess the presence of intestinal metaplasia. Symptoms were recorded with the validated Abdominal Symptom Questionnaire. GERD was defined according to the Montreal definition. Results: In total, 334 subjects were included in the study and underwent endoscopy; 86 subjects suffered from GERD and 211 presented no symptoms or signs of GERD. Based on logistic regression, the estimated area under the curve statistic (AUC) for Hill (0. 65 [95 % CI 0. 59 - 0. 72]) was higher than the corresponding estimate for the axial length of a hiatal hernia (0. 61 [95 % CI 0. 54 - 0. 68]), although the difference was not statistically significant (P= 0. 225). Conclusion: From our data, and in terms of association with GERD, the Hill classification was slightly stronger compared to the axial length of a hiatal hernia, but we could not verify that the Hill classification was superior as a predictor. The Hill classification may replace the axial length of a hiatal hernia in the endoscopic assessment of the mechanical anti-reflux barrier of the gastroesophageal junction...|$|R
