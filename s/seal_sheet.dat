40|$|BACKGROUND:The bi 1 ayer gelatin <b>sealing</b> <b>sheet</b> was {{developed}} as a safe, effective, easy-to-handle and low-cost hemostatic agent. OBJECTIVE:To examine the feasibility of gelatin <b>sealing</b> <b>sheets</b> using a canine aterial hemorrhage mode 1. METHODS:In vivo degradation of gelatin <b>sealing</b> <b>sheets</b> was examined by implanting subcutaneously in rats. For the hemostatic and anti-adhesion efficacy investigations, femoral arteries of dogs were pricked with syringe needle to make as mall hole, and a gelatin(i. e. experimental group) or fibrin glue <b>sealing</b> <b>sheet</b> (i. e. control group) was applied on the hole to stop bleeding (n= 8). After discontinuation of the bleeding, the skin incisions were closed and re-examined 4 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS:From the degradation study, 4 h thermally treated gelatin sheet which degraded within 3 weeks in vivo was chosen for the further hemostatic study. In all cases of gelatin and fibrin glue <b>sealing</b> <b>sheets,</b> bleeding from the needle hole on canine femoral arteries was effectively stopped. Postoperative adhesions and inflammation at the site {{in the experimental group}} were significantly less than those in the control group (P< 0. 01 for adhesion scores). CONCLUSIONS:The gelatin <b>sealing</b> <b>sheet</b> was found to be as effective as the fibrin glue <b>sealing</b> <b>sheet</b> as a surgical hemostatic agent, and more effective in preventing postoperative adhesions. 博士（医学）・甲第 632 号・平成 27 年 3 月 16 日Copyright © 2015 IOS Pres...|$|R

40|$|WCCM - World Congress on Computational Mechanics, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIE, 19 -/ 07 / 2010 - 23 / 07 / 2010 This paper {{deals with}} the {{modelling}} of wearing courses on steel orthotropic decks such as the Millau viaduct in France. This is of great importance when dealing with durability: due to the softness of such a support, the pavement is subjected to considerable strains that may generate top-down cracks in the layer at right angles of the orthotropic plate stiffeners and shear cracks at the interface between pavement and steel. Therefore, a five-point bending fatigue test was developed and improved since 2003 at the ENTPE laboratory, to test different asphalt concrete mixes. This study aims at modelling the mechanical behavior of the wearing course throughout the fatigue test by a finite element method (Comsol Multiphysics software). Each material steel, <b>sealing</b> <b>sheet,</b> asphalt concrete layer is considered and modelled. The modelling of asphalt concrete is complex since it is a heterogeneous material, a viscoelastic medium and it thermosensitive. The actual characteristics of the asphalt concrete (thermo physical parameter and viscoelastic complex modulus) are determined experimentally on cylindrical cores. Moreover, a damage law based on Miner's damage {{is included in the}} model. The modelling of the fatigue test leads to encouraging results. Finally, modelling's results are compared to the experimental data obtained from the five-point bending fatigue test device.

Thus, prepared uniform slurry was coated on FTO glass with a thickness of about 10 μm and active area of ~ 0.5 × 0.5 cm 2 by a doctor blade technique. The film was calcined at 400 °C for 1 h.

40|$|This project {{discusses}} the feasibility {{and effectiveness of}} emergency measures against river floods. The objective of the project is: To develop a method or system to temporarily increase the dike strength during flood wave conditions. Here, the dike strength in its broadest sense is meant. This means that besides the crest height also other properties are considered. Generally, the dike height is designed {{with respect to a}} certain normative water level. The protection level is herewith based on the overtopping and overflowing mechanism. Besides overtopping and overflowing other mechanisms, especially piping, could contribute to dike failure. The project further focuses on these two failure mechanisms. The proposed emergency measure against overtopping is the traditional temporary crest heightening. The proposed measure against piping is the creation of a water berm at the inner side of the dike. The latter decreases the head difference between the river and land side of the dike by inundation of an area behind the dike. Both measures make use of some sort of water retaining system. A system that is very suitable for this purpose is a water-filled tube type of system since it has a good performance on the aspects costs, deployment, stability and applicability. The system consists of two parallel tubes connected at one point. Because piping could become a problem when the system is placed on permeable subsoil, the standard twin tube design is adapted by adding a <b>sealing</b> <b>sheet</b> in front of the tubes to increase the piping length. Finally the reliability of the system is assessed by examining the different failure modes. Especially the logistic feasibility is discussed.
