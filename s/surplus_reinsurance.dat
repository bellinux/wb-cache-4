50|$|The {{ceding company}} may seek <b>surplus</b> <b>reinsurance</b> {{to limit the}} losses it might incur from {{a small number of}} large claims as a result of random {{fluctuations}} in experience. In a 9 line surplus treaty the reinsurer would then accept up to $900,000 (9 lines). So if the insurance company issues a policy for $100,000, they would keep all of the premiums and losses from that policy. If they issue a $200,000 policy, they would give (cede) half of the premiums and losses to the reinsurer (1 line each). The maximum automatic underwriting capacity of the cedant would be $1,000,000 in this example. Any policy larger than this would require facultative reinsurance.|$|E
40|$|We use convex {{optimization}} {{to provide}} a rigorous proof of de Finetti’s retention result for proportional reinsurance. We then extend this result to variable quota share reinsurance and <b>surplus</b> <b>reinsurance</b> with table of lines. We demonstrate by a numerical example that in general neither variable quota share reinsurance nor <b>surplus</b> <b>reinsurance</b> with table of lines may be considered as optimal reinsurance structures...|$|E
40|$|Proportional {{reinsurance}} {{is often}} {{thought to be}} a very simple method of covering the portfolio of an insurer. Theoreticians have not been particularly interested in analysing the optimality properties of these types of reinsurance covers. In this paper, we will use a real-life insurance portfolio in order to compare four proportional structures: quota share reinsurance, variable quota share reinsurance, <b>surplus</b> <b>reinsurance</b> and <b>surplus</b> <b>reinsurance</b> with a table of lines. We adopt {{the point of view of}} the ceding company and propose ways to optimize the proportional covers of the primary insurer...|$|E
5000|$|Life {{insurance}} companies have developed a very extensive battery of alternative risk transfer approaches including life insurance securitization, full recourse reserve funding, funded letters of credit, <b>surplus</b> relief <b>reinsurance,</b> administrative reinsurance and related trechniques. Because life reinsurance is more [...] "financial" [...] to begin with, there is less separation between the conventional and alternative risk transfer markets than in the property & casualty sector.|$|R
40|$|Reinsurance is a {{mechanism}} {{the insurance industry}} uses to spread the risk it assumes from policyholders. Through reinsurance, the industry's losses are absorbed and distributed {{among a group of}} companies so that no single company is overburdened with the financial responsibility of offering coverage to its policyholders. Catastrophes, unexpected liabilities, and a series of large losses that might be too great for an individual insurer to absorb can be handled through reinsurance. Without it, most insurers would be able to cover only the safest of ventures, leaving many risky but worthwhile ventures without coverage. The authors present a primer of reinsurance concepts, explaining such terms as ceding company, primary carrier, direct underwriter, cession, retrocessions, ceding commission, and <b>surplus</b> relief <b>reinsurance.</b> There are separate sections on: 1) The purposes of reinsurance (for example, underwriting capacity, earnings stability, reserve requirement reduction, and mechanism for existing business), 2) Methods of cession for reinsurance contracts (treaty, facultative, and automatic facultative), 3) Types of reinsurance contracts (proportional, nonproportional, hybrid, and retrocessions), 4) Prices and usage of reinsurance contracts, 5) The economics of risk transfer, 6) The characteristics of reinsurance risk, 7) The reinsurance market and 8) Reinsurance regulation.

40|$|Final {{results of}} a {{research}} on the riskiness of a life policies portfolio with dread disease coverage are presented, referring to the insurer's point of view. By means of first and second moments of the random present value of gain on a single policy, portfolio ruin probability's estimates are derived under either Cebicev-Cantelli's inequality or normal distribution hypothesis, in presence of a low positive correlation among risks and also introducing optimal strategies referred to a <b>surplus</b> <b>reinsurance</b> treaty to face the correlation's effects. By means of numerical applications based on insurance company's experiences it is demonstrated that the riskiness and the ruin probability increase when a binary correlation exists...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present final {{results of a}} {{research}} on the riskiness of a life policies portfolio with “dread disease” (briefly: DD) coverage in additional or early form, referring to the insurer’s point of view. By means of first and second moments of the random present value of gain on a single policy, portfolio ruin probability’s estimates are derived under either Cebicev-Cantelli’s inequality or normal distribution hypothesis, in presence of a low positive correlation among risks and also introducing optimal strategies referred to a <b>surplus</b> <b>reinsurance</b> treaty to face the correlation’s effects. By means of numerical applications based on insurance company’s experiences we show the riskiness and the ruin probability considerably increase when a binary correlation exists and we demonstrate the inefficiency of the EEC minimum solvency margin rule, even in presence of optimal reinsurance strategies...|$|E
