5|$|Following the {{realization}} in February 1915 {{that the war}} would not be won quickly, the Navy department decided to replace the six armored cruisers that had been lost thus far. The <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> improved versions of the Derfflinger class; the primary alterations being {{the adoption of the}} 35cm (13.8in) gun for the main battery, along with a full-length forecastle deck. Four <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> ordered and laid down, but only two of them, Mackensen and Graf Spee, were launched. None of the <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> completed, as work had been diverted to U-boat construction. All four <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> broken up in Germany between 1921 and 1924.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ships</b> <b>were</b> {{sometimes}} camouflaged {{in classical}} times. Mediterranean pirate <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> sometimes painted blue-gray for concealment. Vegetius records that Julius Caesar's scout <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> painted bluish-green when gathering intelligence {{along the coast}} of Britain during the Gallic Wars. <b>Ships</b> <b>were</b> sometimes painted deceptively during the Age of Sail, while both sides in the American Civil War camouflaged their ships, whether to run blockades or for night reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|The Albona {{class was}} {{a class of}} mine warfare ships used by the Regia Marina (Royal Italian Navy) and Royal Yugoslav Navy (JKRM). Fourteen <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{originally}} laid down between 1917 and 1918 for the Austro-Hungarian Navy as the MT.130 class. However, the end of World War I and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary left them incomplete until 1920, when three <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> finished for the Regia Marina. An additional five <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> completed for the JKRM in 1931 as the Malinska class.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{commissioned}} on 19 September 1939 by Harland and Wolff from Belfast in Northern Ireland. The <b>ship's</b> keel <b>was</b> laid on 22 May 1940, and the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{launched on}} 2 September. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> commissioned in about one month later, on 18 October.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{laid down}} on 21 October 2008 at the Nordic Yards Wismar in Wismar, Germany with the yard number 147. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{launched}} as Cynthia on 27 January 2009 and work was completed on the vessel on 1 May 2010. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> renamed Amorito in 2010. That same year the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> renamed again to Neermoor, operating under an Antigua and Barbuda flag while owned by Briese Schiffahrts GmbH & Co KG. In 2013 the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> renamed Asterix.|$|R
50|$|During {{the summer}} months of 2008, a {{competition}} for naming the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> held. Since the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> never delivered to Viking Line, {{the winner of the}} contest and the final name of the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> never published.|$|R
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, both <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> kept {{in service}} with the new Turkish Navy, with lengthy {{overhauls}} in the mid-1920s. Both <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> extensively modernized in the late 1930s, and they remained in service to 1944, when they were finally decommissioned. Both vessels were ultimately broken up in the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|All four <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> officially {{laid down}} on 19 December 1912, but work {{did not begin}} until March–April 1913. After a {{progress}} review on 4 June 1914, launching of the first pair of ships was delayed until October 1914. When World War I began, the hull of Izmail, the most advanced ship, was judged 43percent complete, with the others lagging considerably behind. The war caused more delays, including problems obtaining imported components, and the <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> competing for scarce resources with other production deemed necessary for the war. Three of the four <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> launched in 1915, {{but it was clear}} that Russian industry {{would not be able to}} complete them during the war, mostly because the turrets were seriously delayed. They were reclassified as 2nd rank projects by the Main Administration of Shipbuilding in 1916.|$|E
5|$|All three <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{built by}} the STT {{shipyard}} in Trieste.|$|E
50|$|As HMS Adventure the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{deployed}} for 5 {{years between}} 1826 and 1830 {{in a survey}} of Patagonia, under the command of Captain Phillip King. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> accompanied by HMS Beagle. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> sold in 1853.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ships</b> <b>are</b> also {{considered}} units and can perform different tasks. Fishing ships can gather {{food in the}} form of fish, merchant <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> the nautical alternative to traders, and other <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> designed for naval battle or troop transport.|$|R
2500|$|The third SS Empress of China was a 21,860-ton vessel {{launched}} in 1913 from Stettin, Germany, as the SS Tirpitz. [...] The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> purchased in 1921 by Canadian Pacific and curiously, this <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> immediately renamed the Empress of China. [...] Then next year, in 1922, the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> renamed Empress of Australia after re-fitting at Clydebank. [...] The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> ultimately scrapped in 1952.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, {{all five}} <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> interned at the British naval base in Scapa Flow. On 21 June 1919, they were scuttled to prevent their seizure by the Royal Navy. The <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{subsequently}} raised and broken up for scrap between 1929 and 1937.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the world}} wars, Royal Navy <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> painted dark gray in the Home Fleet, light gray in the Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas, and {{white in the}} Indian Ocean and western Pacific. Many Home Fleet <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> painted medium gray during 1939 and 1940 to {{decrease}} visibility from the peacetime dark gray.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{served with}} the fleet {{following}} their commissioning in 1875, though they spent {{a significant part of}} their career in reserve, as Germany maintained {{only a small number of}} ships on active duty for training cruises in the period. The <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> substantially rebuilt in the 1890s into armored cruisers and stationed in Asia for three years. Kaiser was the flagship of Otto von Diederichs's East Asia Squadron during the Kiautschou Bay concession seizure in November 1897. Following their return to Germany in 1899–1900, the <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> used in several secondary roles, including as harbor and barracks ships. The <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> stricken from the naval register in 1906; Deutschland was used as a target ship before being sold for scrap in 1908, though Kaiser served on as a floating barracks until she was sold in 1920.|$|E
50|$|The model <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> all at 1:25 scale. There <b>are</b> 11 <b>ships</b> and 4 tugs. All <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> {{equipped}} with indicators giving rudder angle, engine speed, ship speed, wind speed, etc. Most of the <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> {{equipped with}} {{bow and stern}} thrusters and anchors. Five <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> equipped with a DGPS tracking system. Training with special features like Becker rudder, Schilling rudder, CPP is available.|$|R

25|$|After Walnuts {{arrival in}} Halifax, the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{detained}} at the French Cable Wharf in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> sold by auction {{to pay for}} expenses from the voyage. During the protracted legal process surrounding her refugee passengers, the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> stripped of its brass fittings by thieves and scuttled in shallow water in Dartmouth. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> sold at another auction in 1951 and rebuilt by the Quebec firm Borromee Verreault. Walnut was renamed Keta and worked on the St. Lawrence River and Canadian Arctic until the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> scrapped in 1975.|$|R

5|$|Brazil ordered six Jurua-class {{ships from}} Britain in 1938. These <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{purchased}} by Britain on {{the outbreak of}} war in 1939 and are described above. The Brazilians decided to produce indigenous destroyers, the , at the Ilha das Cobras shipyard, Rio de Janeiro. The design {{was based on the}} H-class plans supplied by Britain, but with guns and machinery supplied by the United States. Although laid down in 1940, the <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> not completed until 1949–51.|$|E
5|$|By 1911, {{the fleet}} was reorganized as the Hochseeflotte (High Seas Fleet), and new {{dreadnought}} battleships {{were beginning to}} enter service. As a result, the Kaiser Friedrich III-class <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> transferred to the III Squadron and then placed into reserve. In 1914, with the outbreak of World War I, the five <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> recalled to active duty {{and placed in the}} V Squadron of the fleet. In February 1915, the <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> withdrawn from active service for a second time. The <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> disarmed by 1916 and transferred to secondary roles. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse became a torpedo training ship and Kaiser Wilhelm II became the headquarters ship for the commander of the High Seas Fleet in Wilhelmshaven. The other three <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> used as floating prisons. In 1917, Kaiser Friedrich III was transferred to barracks ship duties in Flensburg. All of the ships, with the exception of Kaiser Wilhelm II, were stricken from the navy register on 6 December 1919 and sold for scrapping. Kaiser Wilhelm II followed on 17 March 1921. By 1922, all five ships had been broken up for scrap metal. The bow ornaments from Kaiser Friedrich III and Kaiser Wilhelm II are preserved at the Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr in Dresden.|$|E

50|$|The keel for the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> laid in April 2002. The keel {{itself is}} made from {{ironbark}} salvaged from a road at the Breakwater in Warnambool, near where Wylie lives. The ribs of the <b>ship</b> <b>were</b> completed {{towards the end of}} 2003. By 2008 the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> opened to the public at the construction site, while the planking was still being completed. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> largely completed by February 2011.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{used in the}} 1980 movie [...] "The Island" [...] (as the Lindö) {{starring}} Michael Caine. In the movie, the <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> extensively {{featured in}} a scene where the <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> captured by pirates, the <b>ship's</b> crew <b>is</b> killed, and the ship sunk. The Lindö is easily recognizable because of its distinctive red sails. IMDB ...|$|R
5|$|Herodotus {{suggests}} that the Allied <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> heavier and, by implication, less maneuverable. Their weight would further {{reduce the likelihood of}} the Allied ships employing the diekplous. The source of this heaviness is uncertain; possibly the Allied <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> bulkier in construction. Another suggestion is that the heaviness was caused by the weight of fully armoured hoplite marines. The Allies may have had extra marines on board if their <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> less maneuverable, since boarding would then be the main tactic available to them (at the cost of making the ships even heavier). Indeed, Herodotus refers to the Greeks capturing ships, rather than sinking them.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, the Russian Navy sought {{builders}} {{for a pair}} {{of light}} cruisers; the Schichau-Werke shipyard in Danzig won the contract. The two <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> originally ordered by the Russian Navy as Maraviev Amurskyy and Admiral Nevelskoy from the Schichau-Werke that year. The two <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> laid down in 1913; Maraviev Amurskyy was launched on 11 April 1914, after which fitting-out work commenced. Both <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> requisitioned by the German Navy on 5 August 1914, and were renamed Pillau and Elbing, respectively. Elbing was launched on 21 November 1914. Pillau and Elbing were commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 14 December 1914 and 4 September 1915, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The American {{data were}} {{analysed}} by Harold Van Buskirk in 1919. About 1,256 <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> painted in dazzle between 1 March 1918 {{and the end}} of the war on 11 November that year. Among American merchantmen 2,500 tons and over, 78 uncamouflaged <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> sunk, and only 18 camouflaged ships; out of these 18, 11 were sunk by torpedoes, 4 in collisions and 3 by mines.
