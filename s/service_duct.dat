50|$|Older toilets {{infrequently}} have <b>service</b> <b>ducts</b> {{and often}} in old toilets {{that have been}} modernized, the toilet cistern is hidden in a tiled over purpose-built 'box'. Often old toilets still have high-level cisterns in the <b>service</b> <b>ducts.</b> On the outside, the toilet is flushed by a handle (just like an ordinary low-level cistern toilet) although behind the wall this handle activates a chain. Sometimes a long flushing trough is used to ensure the cistern can be refilled quickly after dual flushes. This trend of hiding cisterns and fittings behind the walls started in the late 1930s in the United States and in the United Kingdom from the 1950s, and by the late 1960s it was unusual for toilet cisterns to be visible in public toilets. In some buildings such as schools, however, a cistern can still be visible, although high-level cisterns had become outdated by the 1970s. Many schools now have low-level cisterns.|$|R

25|$|The {{effects of}} soil {{liquefaction}} on {{the built environment}} can be extremely damaging. Buildings whose foundations bear directly on sand which liquefies will experience a sudden loss of support, which will result in drastic and irregular settlement of the building causing structural damage, including cracking of foundations and damage to the building structure itself, or may leave the structure unserviceable afterwards, even without structural damage. Where a thin crust of non-liquefied soil exists between building foundation and liquefied soil, a 'punching shear' type foundation failure may occur. The irregular settlement of ground may also break underground utility lines. The upward pressure applied by the movement of liquefied soil through the crust layer can crack weak foundation slabs and enter buildings through <b>service</b> <b>ducts,</b> and may allow water to damage the building contents and electrical services.|$|R

The 12-storey Critical Care Centre was given planning permission on 23 March 2007 (Ref Z/2006/2083/F). Within the new critical care building will be an accident and emergency department capable of dealing with up to 80,000 visits a year. Within Accident and Emergency there will be a resuscitation area, and departments for major and minor injuries and conditions. There will also be a helipad located on top of the building with a dedicated lift to allow for the speedy transfer of major trauma cases to the A&E (Accident & Emergency wards). Level three of the new building will have four additional theatres. Levels five, six and seven will be dedicated to intensive care. There is capacity for 16 beds per floor, with two eight-bed wards on each floor. A new education centre will be located on level eight of the building, with varyous-sized lecture theatres and seminar rooms to replace the existing education building. Level nine will house the new regional burn unit; this replaces the existing unit and provides for 12 beds and supporting accommodation. Construction work began in summer 2007 with site-clearance work and piling and basement preparations; it was expected to be completed in late 2011.

50|$|There are {{numerous}} interesting features including the original aluminium-cast banking hall doors, created and made by Henry Haig (1930 - 6 December 2007), {{who was an}} English abstract artist, painter and sculptor but notable predominantly for his stained glass work, which consist of an abstract triangle design based on the NatWest logo and are painted to resemble bronze. The banking hall itself has a coffered ceiling of plasterboard covered in gold leaf and Travertine marble floors and skirtings. The exterior is covered in abstract plaster murals and bronze matt ceramic tiles. The lift shaft and two ventilation towers are constructed using brick. The structure was constructed of precast concrete with waffle concrete floor slabs. There are four plant floors {{at the top of}} the tower and 100 car park spaces in a basement car park that has been left disused upon the discovery of asbestos. The office block was accessed via a stainless steel surround doorway on Newhall Street, where the land begins to drop, exposing the ventilation grills for the basement. The entrance here appears to be of a later date to the rest of the building. The office block has a service core at the centre of each floor, consisting of a large <b>service</b> <b>duct,</b> lavatories, four lift shafts and staircase. The lifts have stainless steel doors and the lift lobby has Travertine panelling on the walls. There is a kitchen on the twentieth floor which retains its original green panels and equipment, such as the dumbwaiter. The NatWest logo was attached to the west side of the building, although has since been removed leaving only the bracketing. It is believed that considerable efforts were made to reduce the cost of the tower's construction, which took place during a time when rising oil prices ended the development boom of the 1960s making an increasingly hostile economic climate. Examples of cost-cutting measures employed during the construction of the building include the use of plasterboard to mimic concrete on the banking hall's ceiling and the use of an alternative metal to bronze for the banking hall doors.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{provision}} of transverse openings in floor beams {{to facilitate the}} passage of utility pipes and <b>service</b> <b>ducts</b> results not only in a more systematic layout of pipes and ducts, it also translates into substantial economic savings {{in the construction of}} a multi-storey building. To investigate the problem of openings in beams, the author initiated a research program in the early 1980 s. Since then extensive research has been carried out giving a comprehensive coverage on both circular and large rectangular openings under various combinations of bending, shear and torsion. In this paper, major findings relevant to the analysis and design of such beams under the most commonly encountered loading case of bending and shear are extracted and summarized. An attempt has been made to answer the frequently asked questions related to creating an opening in an already constructed beam and how to deal with multiple openings. It has been shown that the design method for beams with large openings can be further simplified without sacrificing rationality and having unreasonable additional cost...|$|R

40|$|The in-duct {{attenuation}} performance, or insertion loss, of a {{range of}} absorbers was measured, and guidelines for the design and application of absorbers in air ducts were developed from the measured data. A test facility that met the requirements of ISO 7235 was designed and constructed. Insertion loss measurements were made using the test facility to investigate the effects of absorbent material and absorbent thickness, facing type, airflow conditions, and fixing method It was found that absorbent flow resistance was the most influential factor in determining the insertion loss of an absorber. The insertion loss of wall absorbers was significantly modified by changes in absorber thickness, which was attributed to the consequential change in flow resistance. Similarly, the insertion loss performance of bar absorbers with significantly varying thickness, and therefore varying flow resistance, was greater than that of bar absorbers with approximately constant thickness. The insertion loss of wall absorbers was very sensitive to impedance conditions at the boundary between the rear surface of the absorber and the duct wall. Insertion loss performance was improved by applying thin facings to the exposed surface of wall absorbers.

40|$|AbstractPresenting the {{composite}} deck, {{which consists of}} concrete slab with profiled steel sheets fixed to {{the top layer of}} Double Layer Grid (DLG), proved its great efficiency in increasing the load carrying capacity for this type of structures. Earlier studies concluded that the application of the prescribed composite action had solved many problems facing the spread of DLG structures such as their prone to collapse in a progressive manner besides their suitability to be used only as roof covering structures. In addition, the application of {{the composite}} action introduced an economical solution due to considerable savings in steel material used in building the top layer of the DLG structures. However, openings in the deck are needed for architectural purposes such as passing <b>service</b> <b>ducts,</b> day-lighting panels or passing shear walls or continuous structural elements. Adding such openings in the deck affects the efficiency of the composite deck in carrying the assigned loads especially if the openings are being added after the construction is completed. The current research introduced experimental tests along with numerical investigation using ABAQUS software for composite deck space trusses with common cases of support patterns and different deck opening locations. The study shows the obvious effect of the existence of openings and their locations on the load carrying capacity and ductility of DLG space structures...|$|R
40|$|Tall {{towers and}} {{multi-storey}} buildings have fascinated mankind {{from the beginning}} of civilization, their construction being initially for defense and subsequently for ecclesiastical purposes. These tall buildings because of its height, is affected by lateral forces due to wind or earthquake actions tends to snap the building in shear and push it over in bending. In general, the rigidity (i. e. Resistance to lateral deflection) and stability (i. e. Resistance to overturning moments) requirement become more important. Shear walls (Structural walls) contribute significant lateral stiffness, strength, and overall ductility and energy dissipation capacity. In many structural walls a regular pattern of openings has to be provided due to various functional requirements such as to accommodate doors, windows and <b>service</b> <b>ducts.</b> Such type of openings reduces the stiffness of the shear wall to some extent depending on the shape and size of the opening. In the present parametric study, efforts are made to investigate and critically assess the effects of various size of openings in shear walls on the responses and behaviors of multi-storey buildings.

Panels were multiples of this - that is 12 inches or 1 foot, 3 foot, 6 foot and 9 foot. The planning grid was 12x12 inches, and a structural grid of 36x36 inches. The preferred floor to ceiling heights were 8 ft and 10 ft. The structure was steel frame with a 6 ft bay. It was hung with external 10 ft by 3 ft pre-fabricated concrete panels.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a sequence of}} experiments on a long-span asymmetric composite cellular beam. This type of beam has become very popular, combining the composite action between the steel and concrete with the increased section depth, compared with more commonly used solid-web I sections. Openings in the steel web also reduce the self-weight and can accommodate the passage of <b>service</b> <b>ducts.</b> Eurocode 4 recommends {{a high degree of}} shear connection for asymmetric composite beams despite the practical difficulties in achieving this. Recent research suggests that the required degree of shear connection could be reduced, particularly for beams that are unpropped during construction. However, little test data exists to verify the behaviour of unpropped composite cellular beams. Therefore two series of testswere conducted on a 15. 26 mlong asymmetric composite cellular beamwith regular circular openings and an elongated opening at themid-span. The degree of shear connection was 36 %, less than half of that recommended in Eurocode 4, and the beam was unpropped during construction. The beam was subjected to uniformly distributed loading and shear load during the tests. The end-slip, mid-span vertical deflection, shear connector capacity and strain distribution were examined. The beam failed at an applied uniform load of 17. 2 kN/m 2 (3. 4 × design working load 5. 0 kN/m 2). The member withstood an applied shear load that was 45 % higher than predicted, and exhibited a Vierendeel mechanism at the elongated opening.

40|$|Provision {{of utility}} and <b>service</b> <b>ducts</b> are {{important}} part of modern building construction. To facilitate fast and uninterrupted progress the layout of these ducts are planned in advance. Their positions are decided considering the head room provisions in buildings, aesthetic look etc. without jeopardizing the strength,stability and serviceability of the structures. To fulfil these aspects many times ducts have to pass through main load bearing elements like beams. Web openings in a beam adversely affect its strength and stiffness resulting in excessive deflections which may lead to unpleasant appearance {{and the collapse of}} the structure. Therefore, such beams are required to strengthen to restore their strength. The newly developed technique of jacketing the deficit beam with layers of Fiber Reinforced Polymer has proven to be very efficient in restoring and increasing the strength of the beams. Since 1980 extensive research has been carried out on beams with rectangular and circular openings under the most commonly encountered loading case of shear and flexure. The behavior of beams with openings under torsion and its combination with shear and flexure has not been explored much. Hence the aim of the present work is to explore the behavior of rectangular RCC beams with small circular and rectangular openings under torsion. The torsional capacity of beams with openings are extracted experimentally. The study is extended by retrofitting the beams with four layers of bidirectional woven GFRP fabric applied following three different orientations scheme 90 / 90 / 90 / 90, 45 / 45 / 45 / 45 and 90 / 45 / 90 / 45.

The effect of providing different concrete top covers and effect of different concrete strengths have been investigated. With headed shear studs (two studs per sample, Configuration 3) 23 %- 29 % and 20 %- 53 % of increase in shear carrying capacity were achieved by increasing the concrete top cover from 20 mm to 30 mm and the concrete cube strength from grade 20 to grade 45 respectively. Composite slabs with CFSTs were 131 % (only steel tube, Configuration 1) - 385 % (steel tube with welded two steel strips, Configuration 2) higher than composite slabs with headed shear studs (two studs per sample). Then results of composite slabs with headed shear studs were compared with Eurocode- 4 and it was at least 22 % conservative.

40|$|The Ultra Shallow Floor Beam is a {{new type}} of {{composite}} floor beam fabricated by welding two highly asymmetric cellular tees together along the web and incorporating a concrete slab between the top and bottom flanges. The unique features of this system are circular and elongated web openings that allow tie-bars, building <b>services</b> and <b>ducts</b> passing through the structural depth of the beam. For the composite beam in bending, the longitudinal shear force is transferred by a unique shear mechanism which results from the special configuration of the beam, and shear connectors, if they are present. The work reported in this paper includes a total of 16 full-scale push-out tests aimed at investigating the longitudinal shear behaviour of these beams and the effects of additional shear connectors. A theoretical analysis was also performed to investigate the failure mechanism of the system...|$|R
