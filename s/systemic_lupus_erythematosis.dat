40|$|Introduction: Neuropsychiatric <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> {{erythematosus}} {{is often}} clinically challenging to diagnose, treat and monitor. Although brain {{magnetic resonance imaging}} is frequently performed before lumbar puncture in neuropsychiatric <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus, {{it is not clear}} from the literature whether specific brain magnetic resonance imaging findings are associated with distinct clinical features of neuropsychiatric <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on published studies of neuropsychiatric <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus including brain magnetic resonance imaging and the 1999 American College of Rheumatology-defined clinical neuropsychiatric <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus syndromes to determine their relationship. Pooled prevalence and risk ratio for distinct neuropsychiatric <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus associations were determined with 95 % confidence intervals. Results: Of 821 studies screened, 21 fulfilled inclusion criteria. A total of 818 participants were evaluated (91 % female) with 1064 neuropsychiatric <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus episodes assessed. Neuropsychiatric <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus features included headache (24 %), seizures (19 %), cerebrovascular disease (18 %), cognitive dysfunction (15 %) and acute confusional state (14 %). Normal magnetic resonance imaging was significant for anxiety disorder (risk ratio: 9. 00; 95 % confidence interval: 2. 40, 33. 79), autonomic disorder (risk ratio: 7. 00; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 51, 96. 06) and plexopathy (risk ratio: 5. 00; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 81, 31. 00). Highest risk ratio of neuropsychiatric <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus syndrome with abnormal magnetic resonance imaging was observed for cerebrovascular disease (risk ratio: 0. 15; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 10, 0. 24) and demyelination (risk ratio: 0. 11; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 02, 0. 72). Conclusion: Normal magnetic resonance imaging in neuropsychiatric <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus was the most significant correlate from our meta-analysis for psychological symptoms including anxiety and peripheral nerve features of autonomic disorder and plexopathy. The main abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging correlates included cerebrovascular disease and demyelination.

50|$|When a {{cause for}} MUPS is found, the symptom(s) are no longer {{medically}} unexplained. Some cases of ulcers and dyspepsia were considered MUPS until bacterial infections {{were found to be}} their cause. Similarly, in illnesses where long diagnostic delays are common (e.g., certain types of autoimmune disease and other rare illnesses), the patients' symptoms are classifiable as MUPS right up until the point where a formal diagnosis is made (which, in some instances, can take upwards of five years). Even when a person has received a confirmed medical disease diagnosis, they may nonetheless be considered to have MUPS, if they present with symptoms that are either not fully explained by their disease diagnosis, or are considered by the physician to be more severe than would be predicted by their disease. For example, severe fatigue in patients with <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosis</b> (SLE) has been interpreted as MUPS because the fatigue cannot be clearly linked to any of the known biological markers for SLE.|$|E
5000|$|Specialized pro-resolving {{mediators}} (SPM, also termed specialized proresolving mediators) are a {{large and}} growing class of cell signaling molecules formed in cells by the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) by one {{or a combination of}} lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase, and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase enzymes. Pre-clinical studies, primarily in animal models and human tissues, implicate SPM in orchestrating the resolution of inflammation. These studies suggest that synthetic SPM that are resistant to being metabolically inactivated hold promise of being clinically useful pharmacological tools for preventing and resolving a wide range of pathological inflammatory responses along with the tissue destruction and morbidity that these responses cause. Based on animal model studies, the inflammation-based diseases which may be treated by such metabolically resistant SPM analogs include not only pathological and tissue damaging responses to invading pathogens but also a wide array of pathological conditions in which inflammation is a contributing factor such as allergic inflammatory diseases (e.g. asthma, rhinitis), autoimmune diseases ( [...] e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosis),</b> psoriasis, atherosclerosis disease leading to heart attacks and strokes, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and certain dementia syndromes (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Huntingdon's disease).

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> {{erythematosus}} is an age- and gender-associated autoimmune disorder. Previous studies {{suggested that}} defects in the hypothalamic/pituitary axis contributed to <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus disease progression which could also involve growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor- 1 and somatostatin function. This {{study was designed}} to compare basal serum growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor- 1 and somatostatin levels in female <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus patients to a group of normal female subjects. Methods Basal serum growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor- 1 and somatostatin levels were measured by standard radioimmunoassay. Results Serum growth hormone levels failed to correlate with age (r 2 = 3. 03) in the entire group of normal subjects (i. e. 20 – 80 years). In contrast, serum insulin-like growth factor- 1 levels were inversely correlated with age (adjusted r 2 = 0. 092). Of note, serum growth hormone was positively correlated with age (adjusted r 2 = 0. 269) in the 20 – 46 year range which overlapped with the age range of patients in the <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus group. In that regard, serum growth hormone levels were not significantly higher compared to either the entire group of normal subjects (20 – 80 yrs) or to normal subjects age-matched to the <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus patients. Serum insulin-like growth factor- 1 levels were significantly elevated (p 55 yrs) <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus patients. Conclusions These results indicated that <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus was not characterized by a modulation of the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor- 1 paracrine axis when serum samples from <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus patients were compared to age- matched normal female subjects. These results in <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus differ from those previously reported in other musculoskeletal disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and hypermobility syndrome where significantly higher serum growth hormone levels were found.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The goal of {{the present}} study was to {{estimate}} the risk ratio of herpes zoster among <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus patients after disease onset compared with a cohort of patients without <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus over a three-year period. METHODS: A nationwide population-based cohort study using the National Health Insurance Research Database identified 10, 337 new cases of <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus as the study cohort. In addition, 62, 022 patients without <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus, who were matched for age, gender, and date of <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus diagnosis, were used as the comparison cohort. These cohorts were followed-up for three years. A Cox proportional hazard regression was performed to estimate the risk ratio of herpes zoster, with adjustments for age, gender, level of insurance, urbanization level, geographic region, comorbid medical conditions, average daily dosage of corticosteroids, and the use of immune-modulation agents. RESULTS: Compared to patients without <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus, the crude risk ratio and adjusted risk ratio of herpes zoster among <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus patients were 7. 37 (95 % confidence interval 6. 75 - 8. 04) and 2. 45 (95 % confidence interval 1. 77 - 3. 40), respectively. Stratified by gender, the adjusted risk ratio of herpes zoster was 2. 10 (95 % confidence interval 1. 45 - 2. 99) in women and 7. 51 (95 % confidence interval 2. 89 - 19. 52) in men.

RESULTS: We included 57 childhood-onset <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus patients (mean age 17. 33 +/- 4. 50), 64 first-degree relatives (mean age 39. 95 +/- 5. 66), and 57 healthy (mean age 19. 30 +/- 4. 97) controls. Serum interferon alpha levels were significantly increased in childhood-onset <b>systemic</b> <b>lupus</b> erythematosus patients compared to their first-degree relatives and healthy controls. Interferon alpha levels were significantly increased in patients with positive dsDNA antibodies, patients with cutaneous vasculitis, patients with new malar rash and patients who were not receiving medication.
