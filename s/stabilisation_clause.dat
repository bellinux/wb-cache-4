50|$|One {{addition}} to many contracts between governments and investors is a <b>Stabilisation</b> <b>Clause,</b> which insulates investors from {{the effect of}} changed governmental regulations. Such clauses severely restrict the government’s ability to change any regulations {{that would have a}} negative economic impact on the investment. While advantageous for businesses, these stabilization clauses would severely hinder the ability of governments to address possible social and/or environmental concerns that become apparent after the beginning of the project.|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is the {{threshold}} beyond which compensation is payable for breach of a <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clause.</b> The discussion {{is based on the}} tax stability clauses contained in the mining development agreements unilaterally cancelled by the Government of the Republic of Zambia in early 2008. The outstanding characteristic feature of the tax stability clauses was government’s undertaking that it shall not, for the stability periods ranging between 10 to 20 years, introduce new fiscal measures resulting in a “material adverse effect” on the distributable profits of the mining companies or the dividends received by the shareholders of the companies. Government further undertook to ‘fully’ and ‘fairly’ compensate mining companies should such measures be introduced during the stability periods. The question investigated by the thesis is whether the fiscal measures introduced by government in early 2008, as amended in 2009, have resulted in a “material adverse effect” on the distributable profits of mining companies or the dividends received by the shareholders of the companies and, therefore, entitle mining companies to compensation from government. The main findings of the thesis, among others, are that: The threshold beyond which the obligation to pay compensation is triggered varies considerably depending on the specific contractual formulation of the <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clause</b> involved. However, it is significantly lower than the threshold beyond which host States must pay compensation in regulatory taking cases. Although there are several international arbitral awards in which payment of compensation has been ordered for breach of a freezing <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clause,</b> there is no known similar award in cases involving breach of an economic equilibrium <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clause.</b> Even in cases in which compensation has been ordered for breach of a <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clause,</b> {{there is no evidence of}} how much the presence of a <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clause</b> contributes to the total quantum of the compensation awarded. The tribunals either take a "contractual perspective" or an "expropriation perspective" to arrive at their respective decisions on the quantum of compensation. International arbitral tribunals take into account any ‘excessive’ or ‘windfall profits’ made by investors in deciding the quantum of compensation payable to the investor for breach of a <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clause.</b> The tax stability clauses contained in the mining development agreements cancelled by the Zambian government are typical economic equilibrium stabilisation clauses. Based on these findings, among others, the thesis has concluded that there are equal chances that the Zambian government may or may not be ordered to pay compensation to the aggrieved mining companies. Notwithstanding this conclusion, however, the thesis has noted that government’s unilateral cancellation of the mining development agreements has potential to negate the country’s investment image. Against this background, the recommendation of the thesis is that government and the aggrieved mining companies must engage in discussions with a view to reaching at an amicable solution to their standoff. The rationale behind the recommendation is that an amicable solution presents a perfect opportunity for both parties to come up with a decision that is mutually beneficial to their interests. Also it is less costly than international arbitration. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010. Centre for Human Rightsunrestricte...|$|E
40|$|Investment law is {{a rapidly}} moving and {{increasingly}} debated area of international law. Shifts in international economic relations, the broad nature of investment standards, {{the role played by}} arbitral tribunals and the guarantees granted by law to foreign investors are the object of many comments and disagreements. In particular, it is often feared that contractual stability commitments taking the form of stabilisation clauses are excessive and detrimental to states in terms of sovereignty. This thesis does not focus on the sovereignty debate but proposes a contextual analysis of those stabilisation clauses. Because stabilisation clauses implement FDI protection policies, it suggests that the sustainability of a <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clause</b> essentially depends on whether the FDI protection policy remains compatible with host states' future public policies and development needs. The sustainability of stabilisation clauses is thus considered at three different levels: in terms of (a) political and economic ideology, (b) policymaking and Cc) in terms of contractual commitments. The thesis finds that the current FDI framework suffers from significant ideological tensions because it defends liberal values and imposes liberal standards which tend to ignore national interests. At the same time, it suggests that the policies are not legally unsustainable: they provide broad standards of treatment, do not breach the debated 'right to development' and do not prevent host states from setting up 'valid' policies and regulatory measures as long as a due process of law is observed. Investment contracts, in turn, are often criticised for their negative impacts on states' regulatory powers, but they provide little reliable guarantees of stability to foreign investors and justify a need to rely on contract stabilisation commitments, especially since the role and interpretation of 'legitimate expectations' under the Fair and Equitable standard of treatment is changing. Current contract stabilisation methods, however, create unreasonable expectations, make FDI policies legally unbalanced and must therefore be reviewed to allow for more policy space and to create more 'legitimate' predictability expectations.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the rationale and on-going purpose of <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clauses</b> {{and the ways}} in which the clauses undermine the pursuit of sustainable development in developing countries. 	 Two presumptions prevail in the literature on <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clauses.</b> The first is that developing countries compete for foreign investment on the basis of political risks. The second is that there are higher levels of political risks in developing countries. This thesis argues that neither presumption is true as such. The available evidence points to a more intense competition among foreign investors backed by their home governments for access to the extractive resources in developing countries. The political risks that <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clauses</b> are aimed at also exist, at least in equal measure, in developed countries. Nevertheless, <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clauses</b> are routinely recommended to developing countries as an ‘essential’ feature of an attractive investment climate. This recommendation is, however, not supported by any reliable evidence pointing to a link between <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clauses</b> and foreign investment inflow. The literature on the potential adverse impacts of <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clauses</b> has evolved in a compartmentalised way, focusing on their impact on the ability of host governments to enact environmental and/or human rights laws. This approach and focus are misplaced because in practice, <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clauses</b> rarely limit the ability of host governments to enact human rights and environmental laws. Rather, they limit their ability to alter their fiscal and economic laws and policies in other to integrate such laws and policies with their social and environmental objectives. The main implication of this limitation is that such governments are unable to mobilise the maximum of available funds to finance their sustainable development measures including those specifically directed at eradicating poverty, improving human rights standards and protecting the environment...|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{political}} risks, particularly of indirect expropriation in long-term energy investment contracts, focusing on <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clauses</b> and examining what driving force(s) influence host states to agree to insert such clauses in their host governmental contracts. The secondary {{aim of this}} work is to examine the political structure of Azerbaijan and Turkey and the guarantees available to foreign investors under their laws within those nations from a comparative perspective. The work dedicates particular attention to how effective internal factors in Azerbaijan and Turkey are in facilitating contractual stability in their respective energy investment projects. This study applies both comparative and empirical research methods, fieldwork and library based research. It seeks to provide a theoretical and comparative understanding of political regimes, foreign investment laws and constitutional guarantees and investment policies in Azerbaijan and Turkey. The work has provided that the driving forces behind why Azerbaijan and Turkey consented to insert <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clauses</b> in the host government agreements of Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Project (BTC) can be attributed to each of these being in possession of: a weak bargaining position, weak formal and informal institutions, insufficient laws on foreign direct investment, absence of specific petroleum legislations and a keenness to promote investment and economic activities in their regional markets. It is imperative to lenders and insurers that the host state where the investment will be made is a stable environment. In order to be satisfied that this is the case and to future-proof themselves against risk, they require the insertion of <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clauses</b> in host government agreements. Credit-rating agencies assessments exercise influence over the terms to be agreed and, indeed over the investor’s decision whether to participate in a project. Further research into <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clauses</b> might invite the analysis of specific petroleum producing countries from different regions to better understand how internal and external factors are effective in providing stability. The transferability of the research findings could be further strengthened by surveying and interviewing more participants from petroleum companies, non-governmental organisations, law firms, financial institutions, political risk insurance providers, government bureaucrats and international academics...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, Zambia has seen an {{increase}} in the flow of foreign direct investment; a large quantity of which went into the copper mining industry. The price of copper increased radically, which prompted the Zambian government to reconsider the preferential tax regime that foreign mining companies enjoyed to ensure that Zambia benefited from this change in circumstances. The tax regime was originally implemented to encourage the inflow of foreign capital, and to revive an industry that had been crippled by previously low copper prices. The concession agreements between the Government of Zambia and the mining companies contained <b>Stabilisation</b> <b>clauses</b> which constitute a promise {{on the part of the}} host government not to amend its laws in a way that adversely affects the economic rights contained within that particular concession agreement. The article examines <b>Stabilisation</b> <b>clauses</b> in concession agreements and their legal effect on a host state’s power to amend its laws unilaterally. This issue is discussed in light of the Kuwait v Aminoil case which seems to suggest that “Stabilisation clauses ” do not outrightly prohibit states from modifying their laws when economic circumstances change. Finally the article looks at a legal framework that ensures that neither the rights of the investor on one hand or the state on the other take precedence over the other. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{petroleum}} industry is beset with risks that can threaten the commercial viability of extractive companies. These risks also pose {{a danger to}} the economies of countries and the jobs {{of the men and women}} on the ground. Some of these risks are unavoidable and come part and parcel with extracting hydrocarbons. However, fiscal risk is something that can be managed and thereby minimized ? for the good of both the state hosting the resource and the extractive company. A number of tools exist to manage this risk; this study looks at the fiscal <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clause</b> as it is a particularly popular option for investors. The study takes a qualitative approach through an investigation into literary works and explores how and why the fiscal stabilization clause has become a popular option for fiscal risk management. These clauses have been heavily criticized by various stakeholders and yet they remain as relevant today as when they were first shaped in the 20 th century. The study also looks at the controversy surrounding the validity of such clauses by examining various legal sources ? particularly doctrinal writings and international arbitration rulings. The investigation reveals a shift in the stabilisation clause?s scope, and more importantly its objective, over the years. Drafters as well as legal opinion seems to be at odds with the restrictive nature of yesteryear clauses, which may unjustly tie the hands of a host state ? and as such a more balanced approach is sought. These considerations lead to the main thrust of the study which is to determine what practical drafting steps can be taken to ensure the efficacy of these clauses. The focus leans on the most pertinent substantive components that such a clause should contain to ensure the risks and benefits of resource development are shared fairly. The procedure and objective of the renegotiation mechanism contained the clause is particularly important as it is this key ingredient that makes or breaks the fiscal stability of a project. The study builds on extensive writings on the subject and attempts to build a body of best practice in this regard. Mini Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{political}} risks, particularly {{the risk of}} expropriation, and examines specific contract clauses to evaluate {{the extent to which}} they play a role in mitigating the political risks in transnational energy projects. International energy investors face a number of political risks during the life span of energy projects. The management of these risks through contract clauses, analysed primarily from a legal and an empirical perspective, is the focus of this thesis. The research was based on a review of the existing literature and a questionnaire-based survey circulated to the main players in the petroleum sector: International Oil Companies, National Oil Companies, Lawyers, Arbitrators, Academics and Research Institutions. Chapter II deals with political risks in international energy investments. First, political risk is defined and categorised and then the susceptibility of transnational energy projects to political risks is examined. Chapter III begins by examining the concept of expropriation, followed by the legal requirements for lawful expropriation. Then it explains why indirect expropriation is a long-term and difficult issue for the energy industry. The chapter also addresses the question of how to distinguish between legitimate non-compensable regulation and indirect expropriation. The chapter concludes by looking briefly at contractual clauses used by international energy investors to manage political risk. Part Two takes a closer look at specific contractual clauses in light of political risk management and analyses the results of the empirical survey. Chapter IV examines the validity and effectiveness of traditional <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clauses.</b> Chapter V considers renegotiation clauses and their effectiveness to mitigate political risk as an alternative to <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clauses.</b> Chapter VI deals with equilibrium clauses as a modern practice. Chapter VII examines choice of law and alternative dispute resolution clauses in connection with the management of political risks. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Seats of {{corporate}} convenience (SCCs) include tax havens, offshore finance centres and other locations frequently used by transnational corporations to channel their investments around the world. They form {{some of the}} important structural elements of the global economy. This thesis examines the role of SCCs in the evolution and growth of investor-state arbitration (ISA). By analysing 463 ISA cases {{through the lens of}} SCCs, it highlights how bilateral investment treaties (BITs) came {{to be used in the}} context of investments that were not bilateral, being routed via one or more SCCs. The Research Question in this thesis was: If the provision of Investor-State Arbitration (ISA) in Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) was intended to promote flows of investments between the signatories to such treaties, how did it come to apply to indirect investments channelled through one or more seats {{of corporate}} convenience (SCCs) ? There are two aspects to this question, namely: (a) What crucial changes took place in the global economy after the 1950 s to enable ISA to be used in the context of indirect investments? (b) What was the input of key actors such as states (particularly, the US and the developing countries), transnational corporations (TNCs), international organisations (IOs), and professionals (mainly, lawyers) in this process? ISA was first proposed in the context of a treaty and an investor-state agreement. The idea was then promoted in the form of a multilateral convention by Shell and a few individuals led by Herman Abs, a banker, and a British attorney general, Lord Shawcross. It did not culminate into a treaty despite the support of the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and other international organisations. Germany and Switzerland then used the draft to enter into BITs, not all of which embraced investor-state arbitration. Around the 1950 s and the 1960 s, foreign investment in a host state tended to be made by a multinational with a clearly defined home state. The usual mode was the setting up of a subsidiary or a branch office. Foreign direct investment (FDI) was associated with an investor’s control and a 10 - 25 % ownership over the investment vehicle. FDI was distinguishable from portfolio investments and debts. It tended to be in the sectors of extraction, production, or manufacturing. The developing countries tended to borrow money for their development objectives. States’ right to regulate investments in their territories was generally accepted albeit that the compensation payable tended to be disputed. Indeed, the OECD countries themselves used this right when necessary. BITs surged in numbers in the 1990 s. The oft-cited justification for burgeoning numbers of BITs was that they would help the developing countries to attract FDI, a source of non-debt financing. However, in a globalised and highly financialised economy, the concept of FDI itself transformed to drop its association with control or a minimum ownership. In the context of ISA, it also ceased to be distinguished from loans, portfolio investments, and indeed, from a need to bring in new capital to a host state. The investors’ character was no longer that of a multinational with a clearly defined home state. The major investors were TNCs who can claim allegiance with a home state, if they need to, but whose businesses were increasingly mobile and financialised. BITs clearly contained the expectation that their signatory states would promote and protect investments from one state into the other, for their mutual benefit. Investments, however, tend to be made via SCCs thus rendering the bilateral focus on their promotion inapposite. Each investment can potentially have several investors and home states, even if they may be under the control of one ultimate investor. Expensive jurisdiction battles waged between the investors and states are indicative of the difficulty of applying BITs to the conditions they were not designed for. The mismatch between the design and function of BITs was not aleatory, but was brought about by landmark ISA awards, and it was facilitated by the actions of key actors (both state and non-state), and by the radical changes in the global economy. FDI statistics are, therefore, difficult to correlate to home or host states, and their BITs. The first twenty years of ISA appear to have been based on express agreements for such arbitrations between investors and home states. This would change to the consent to ISA being derived from BITs and investment laws, without the need for an express agreement between investors and states. Application of ISA to the radically transformed actors and situations has come about with the input of states (particularly, the US and the developing countries), TNCs, international organisations (IOs), and professionals (lawyers). There was no urgent demand in the 1980 s- 90 s to protect investors against expropriation (the incidence of which had peaked in the mid- 1970 s, and declined). There was no reasonable justification for states to have privatised and outsourced their disputes in BITs, particularly commercial disputes. Yet, developing countries signed BITs, perhaps reluctantly due to their debt-vulnerability; the BITs did not clearly indicate how ISA would work, if indeed, the developing countries understood it at the time. The BITs that appear to have been against the developing countries’ interests were probably signed for the potential (not a promise) of increased investments. The US, an SCC, legitimised the use of other SCCs and offshore entities. It promoted and encouraged indirect investments. The US legal framework endorses the use, by the US investors, of BITs negotiated by other states. The US used both its aid programme and its influence in the IMF and the World Bank to promote various measures of deregulation, privatisation, and liberalisation of the developing countries. Various IOs promoted BITs and other liberalisation measures, without a focus on their effect on the developing countries’ ability to service, much less reduce, their overall debt. Their emphasis was on the improvement of the investment climate; the World Bank set up a specialist advisory agency for foreign investment. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) actively encouraged conferences and workshops to bring countries together to draft BITs. IOs’ thus played an important part in encouraging the developing countries to enter into BITs as a tool to attract FDI. No IO appears to have drawn to the attention of the developing countries to the possibility of BITs, without further agreement, leading to potential ISA with any investor who could fulfil their expansive eligibility criteria. The US also created and nurtured the conditions that allowed oligopolistic TNCs to emerge, expand and thrive. This involves allowing TNCs a substantial say in the US policy-making and implementation. TNCs made a big contribution to the US drafting of its model BIT. Some of the corporations had the early movers’ advantage because they had also contributed to the early drafts at the time of the involvement of Abs and Shawcross; that involvement in international norm-making was spearheaded by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). The ICC also led the making of the operative norms that make international arbitration a powerful, effective, and largely self-regulating tool. Various lawyers, accountancy and consultancy firms helped in the convergence of practices of TNCs whether it was in relation to <b>stabilisation</b> <b>clauses,</b> tax-arrangements via SCCs, transfer pricing, or the use of offshore special purpose entities. Arbitration lawyers were mainly responsible for expanding the scope of ISA to the point that an express consent to arbitration was no longer the cornerstone of this institution that was founded on party autonomy. States’ authority to regulate the investments in their territories was transferred to private arbitration tribunals in a continuum; the original idea for such a transfer was promoted by the close association of the banker Abs, the British lawyers Shawcross and Lauterpacht, and the Anglo-Dutch TNC, Shell; this was followed by a wider, looser coordination involving the ICC, the United Nations, International Bar Association, the OECD, and so on. The World Bank set up the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) in 1964, but it was slow off the mark. Another period of close association of a few arbitration lawyers gave it the boost it needed by (a) dispensing with express consent to arbitration, and (b) deriving a consent to arbitration from states’ BITs or investment legislations. A small pool of arbitrators ensured that the early ICSID cases promoted this interpretation. The scope of ISA expanded by treating BITs as, a) open offers of arbitration for all and sundry investments, and b) the last hoops through which the investment had to pass cursorily, even if it did so in a restructuring carried out after its initial entry in the host state. The extensive use of SCCs meant that the ISA-eligible investors were an expanding and moveable class in respect of any investment. With the feedback loops provided by the long-term BITs and persuasive awards, the path-dependent ISA got increasingly away from its original justification, while undermining the political bargains underpinning any bilateral commitment to promote investments from a home state to a host state. This analysis demonstrates the need to re-think the whole concept and the framework of investment protection. The framework needs to be aligned with (a) the realities of the 21 st century investments routinely channelled through SCCs, and (b) the balance between states’ and private actors’ powers and interests. Arbitration awards have interpreted BITs to include within the scope of ISA, not just FDI, but also, portfolio investments and loans. This expansion coupled with the effective operative norms for the enforcement of ISA awards, effectively make BITs work as a regime for the enforcement of sovereign debt. BITs also provide an additional tool to enforce investors’ commercial contractual rights. BITs’ role in promoting developmental objectives (e. g. by reducing debt) have been all but abandoned along with any need for investors to negotiate express investor-state arbitration agreements with their host states. BITs were primarily drafted in the days of regulated economies, i. e. pre- 1990. It is uncertain, however, whether, and to what extent, they remain relevant within a deregulated, neoliberal and laissez faire environment. The failure to ask this question indicates how significant an advantage the ISA option is to the interests of TNCs, the main beneficiaries of ISA. In carrying out the necessary research, I have conducted library research (primary and secondary sources) and devoted a large part of my research to the content analysis of Bilateral Investment Treaties and 463 Investor-State Arbitration Awards...|$|R
