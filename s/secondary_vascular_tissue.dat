In {{the case of}} the lignophytes (i. e., progymnosperms and seed plants), the ability to form abundant <b>secondary</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> (<b>secondary</b> xylem and phloem) can, however, provide useful characters to compare isolated roots to stems from the same deposit to better understand the whole-plant structure and function of fossil plants. Methodology. We studied five permineralized lignophyte roots with well-preserved secondary xylem, and in two cases some secondary phloem, from the Early Carboniferous Lydiennes Formation of the Montagne Noire, France, using classical thin sections. Pivotal results. Analysis of the <b>secondary</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> of the roots allows us to distinguish three wood morphotypes that suggest affinities with at least three different types of stems previously reported in the Montagne Noire.

Conclusions. This study illustrates how the affinities of isolated permineralized lignophyte roots can be narrowed down by comparing their wood anatomy with that of stems from the same deposit.

Secondary growth {{involves an}} increase in the diameter of shoots and roots through formation of <b>secondary</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>tissue.</b> A hallmark of secondary growth initiation in shoots of dicotyledonous plants is the initiation of meristematic activity between primary vascular bundles, i. e. in the interfascicular regions.

Surprisingly, despite its major implications for plant growth and the accumulation of biomass, the molecular regulation of secondary growth is only poorly understood. Here, we combine histological, molecular and genetic approaches to characterize interfascicular cambium initiation in the Arabidopsis thaliana inflorescence shoot. Using genome-wide transcriptional profiling, we show that stress-related and touch-inducible genes are up-regulated in stem regions where secondary growth takes place. Furthermore, we show that the products of COI 1, MYC 2, JAZ 7 and the touch-inducible gene JAZ 10, which are components of the JA signalling pathway, are cambium regulators. The positive effect of JA application on cambium activity confirmed a stimulatory role of JA in secondary growth, and suggests that JA signalling triggers cell divisions in this particular context...|$|E

The appearance of separate vascular segments at some levels is associated with departure of paired leaf traces. Between levels of trace departure, the three-ribbed protostele is reconstituted with primary xylem ribs following a helical course through the stem and supplying a regular Fibonacci phyllotaxis. Attached petiole bases are broadly of the Kalymma-type but exhibit a distinctly three-ribbed medial petiole bundle. The new specimen is assigned to Bostonia perplexa requiring an expanded concept of the taxon. A restricted cladistic analysis of stelar architecture and nodal anatomy within the Calamopityaceae produces two phylogenetic hypotheses.

The redefinition of Bostonia proposed here, a protostelic calamopityacean with medullosan-like vascular segments, reinforces long-standing views of a calamopityacean origin of Medullosales.

The rate of cambial cell divisions for the assembly of new xylem and phloem tissue primordia and the rate of differentiation of the primordia into mature tissues determine the amount of biomass produced and, in the case of woody species, the wood quality. These complex physiological processes proceed at a rate which depends on several factors, acting at various levels: growth regulators, resource availability and environmental factors. Several hormonal signals and, more recently, further regulatory molecules, {{have been shown to be}} involved in the induction and maintenance of cambium and the formation of <b>secondary</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues.</b> The control of xylem cell patterning is of particular interest, because it determines the diameter of xylem vessels, which is central to the efficiency of water and nutrient transport from roots to leaves through the stem and may strongly influence the growth in height of the tree. Increasing scientific evidence have proved the role of other hormones in cambial cell activities and the study of the hormonal signals and their crosstalking in cambial cells may foster our understanding of the dynamics of xylogenesis and of the mechanism of vessel size control along the stem. In this article, the role of the hormonal signals involved in the control of cambium and xylem development in trees and their crosstalking are reviewed...|$|R
30|$|Members of the Class III homeodomain-Leu zipper family play an {{important}} role in determining plant morphological architecture. In Arabidopsis, there are five Class III HD-Zip genes: REV, PHB, PHV, CNA, and ATHB 8. Phenotypic analysis of loss-of-function mutants of these genes showed that they play distinct overlapping and antagonistic roles in development. PHB, PHV, and REV play overlapping and crucial roles during the establishment of apical bilateral symmetry and leaf abaxial/adaxial polarity (Prigge et al. 2005); rev phv double mutants displayed a trumpet-shaped leaf. REV plays {{an important}} role in the formation of the floral meristem. rev mutants display defective floral organs and produce sterile flowers. CNA and ATHB 8 exhibit antagonistic functions toward REV during the formation of the lateral shoot meristem and the floral meristem, which can restore the partial phenotype of rev mutants (Prigge et al. 2005). In maize, RLD 1 encodes an HD-ZipIII protein whose adaxial expression is defined by miRNA 166 -directed transcript cleavage on the abaxial side, which is an important determinant of adaxial cell fate during maize leaf development (Juarez et al. 2004). In Populus trichocarpa, eight HD-Zip III genes have been identified (Ko et al. 2006; Côté et al. 2010). PRE, a homolog of the Arabidopsis REV gene, is related to the initiation of the cambium and the pattern of <b>secondary</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> (Robischon et al. 2011). Another member, PCN, may negatively regulate <b>secondary</b> <b>vascular</b> cell differentiation (Kim et al. 2005; Du et al. 2011). In addition, PtrHB 7, an ortholog of AtHB 8 in Arabidopsis, plays an essential role in the regulation of balanced differentiation between secondary xylem and phloem tissues during the process of secondary growth in Populus. These previous studies provide evidence that HD-Zip III members have evolved distinct functions and exert different pleiotropic effects on growth and development in different plants.|$|R
40|$|The plant {{cytoskeleton}} {{has been}} implicated {{in a variety of}} morphogenetic events in higher plants. Most of this work, however, has concentrated on epidermal cells or primary tissues. We have investigated the cortical microtubular (CMT) and microfilament (MF) components of the cytoskeleton in a <b>secondary</b> <b>tissue</b>  –  active <b>vascular</b> cambium of Aesculus hippocastanum L. (horse-chestnut)  –  and followed the changes in these components during the early stages of differentiation of fusiform cambial derivatives to axial elements of the <b>secondary</b> <b>vascular</b> system. A correlative approach was used employing indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of α-tubulin on 6 μm sections, and transmission electron microscopy of 60 nm sections. The study has demonstrated a rearrangement of the CMT cytoskeleton, from random to helical, as fusiform vascular cambial cells begin to differentiate as <b>secondary</b> phloem <b>vascular</b> <b>tissue.</b> A similar CMT rearrangement is seen as fusiform cambial cells begin to differentiate as secondary xylem fibres. This rearrangement is interpreted as evidence of determination of cambial derivatives towards vascular development. Axially-oriented MF bundles are present in fusiform cambial cells and their axial orientation is retained in the vascular derivatives at early stages of their development even though the CMTs have become rearranged...|$|R
40|$|The {{anatomy of}} {{young and old}} stems of Aristolochia macrophylla has been {{investigated}} for {{a better understanding of}} how secondary growth processes cause changes in the stem anatomy of a lianescent plant. In A. macrophylla, following an increase in volume of <b>secondary</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues,</b> the cortical tissues are deformed and the outer sclerenchymatous cylinder ruptures. Morphometric measurements prove that the inner zone of the cortical parenchymatous tissue is compressed prior to the rupture of the outer sclerenchymatous cylinder. After the rupture has occurred, the radial width of the inner primary cortex slightly increases again. This could be caused by strain relaxation, suggesting that the inner primary cortex mechanically behaves similarly to cellular technical foam rubbers. Two different experiments were undertaken to test the outer cortical cylinders mechanically. The outer cortical cylinders comprise the outer sclerenchymatous cortical tissue and a collenchymatous sheath underneath the epidermis and the epidermis. In a first experiment, transverse compression loads were applied to the outside of the cortical cylinders causing ovalization of the cylinder until failure. This experiment allowed the Young's Modulus of the outer cortical cylinders to be determined. In a second set of experiments, radial hydraulic pressure was applied to the inside of the cortical cylinders, mimicking the mechanical effects of internal growth processes. The increase of the internal pressure finally led to rupture of the cortical cylinders. The circumferential stresses acting on the inner surface of the cortical cylinders were calculated. These data allow quantitative estimates of the radial and circumferential pressures effected by <b>vascular</b> <b>secondary</b> growth processes during ontogeny in A. macrophylla stems. The experimental results further indicate that the outer sclerenchymatous cylinder is the main contributor to mechanical stability of young A. macrophylla stems...|$|R

Using techniques of light and scanning microscopy, the morphoanatomy and some microcharacters of the winged stem of Pterospartum. tridentatum are described and {{compared with those of}} other close taxa, also inserted in the Genistinae and with whom R tridentatum is mistaken: Chamaespartium tridentatum (L.) Gibbs, C. sagittale (L.) Gibbs and G. florida L. P. tridentatum winged stem presents a peculiar anatomy, with characteristics of a dicot stem and leaf. The central vein is organized as a <b>secondary</b> stem and <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> are surrounded by a ring of mechanical elements. Some epidermal microcharacters, such as the predominant type of stomata and their way of insertion, are unique and are not found in the other Genistinae studied. These characters were not described in P. tridentatum and support its delimitation as a distinct and natural taxon...|$|R
