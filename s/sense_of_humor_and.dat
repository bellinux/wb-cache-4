Ort has an excellent memory for rock trivia, which served him well in running the store. Perhaps more importantly, his off-the-wall <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> warmly iconoclastic personality (and his thrift-sale wardrobe) were regularly on display at parties, gigs and musical venues around town.|$|E
5|$|After a {{visit from}} his sick mother, Arletta (Jo Van Fleet), Luke becomes more optimistic about his situation. He {{continually}} confronts the Captain and the guards, and his <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> independence prove to be both contagious and inspiring to the other prisoners. Luke's struggle for supremacy peaks when he leads a work crew in a seemingly impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than one day. The other prisoners start to idolize him after he makes and wins a spur-of-the moment bet that he can eat fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour.|$|E

5|$|After {{moderate}} {{sales of}} their debut album Cheshire Cat (1995), released on independent record label Cargo Music, Blink-182 enjoyed {{a small amount}} of success. Throughout 1994 and 1995, the trio vigorously toured nonstop and grew in popularity, mostly in Australia, where audiences embraced the band's irreverent <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> stage shows. When the trio grew frustrated when fans lamented the inability to purchase Cheshire Cat at their respective local record stores, they began to turn toward other record labels to achieve wider distribution than Cargo. By the end of 1995, problems had become apparent between the trio and the label, who regarded the band as a joke not to be taken seriously.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Perry portrays Chandler Bing, an {{executive}} in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration for a large, multinational corporation. Chandler hates this job, although it pays well. He attempts to quit during season one, but is lured {{back with a}} new office and a pay raise. He eventually quits this job in season nine due to a transfer to Tulsa. He becomes a junior copywriter at an advertising agency later that season. Chandler has a peculiar family history being {{the son of an}} erotic novelist mother and a gay, cross-dressing Las Vegas star father.

Before his relationship with Monica, Chandler dated Janice Hosenstein in season one and subsequently broke up with her many times. Matthew Perry has expressed his similarities to the character, such as his need to break an awkward silence with a joke and difficulties with women when first joining the show.|$|E
5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E

500|$|With {{just four}} chords and one manic tempo, New York's Ramones blasted open the clogged arteries of mid-'70s rock, reanimating the music.

5000|$|Sande's first poems were {{published}} in 1929 in a volume titled Svarte næter (Black Nights).

25|$|In Western European terms, Spybuck's style {{might be}} called naïve art, but his works differs from most naïve artists' due to the {{influence}} of ethnographic patronage that guided his choice to include certain details and an infusion of a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> personality. His scenes can provide subtle hints of attitudes and personalities of individual people and often include whimsical details on the periphery that contrast with the central activities.|$|E
25|$|United States Special Envoy for the Korean Peace Talks, Charles Kartman, who was {{involved}} in the 2000 Madeleine Albright summit with Kim, characterised Kim as a reasonable man in negotiations, to the point, but with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> personally attentive to the people he was hosting. However, psychological evaluations conclude that Kim Jong-il's antisocial features, such as his fearlessness in the face of sanctions and punishment, served to make negotiations extraordinarily difficult.|$|E
25|$|Miike has {{garnered}} international notoriety for depicting shocking {{scenes of}} extreme violence and sexual perversions.

25|$|MDK2 {{received}} generally positive reviews {{across all}} systems, with critics praising the graphics, variety of gameplay styles, level design, boss fights, the game's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> <b>and</b> its {{fidelity to the}} original MDK. The most commonly criticized aspects of the game were the difficulty level, which was felt to be too high, and the platforming sections, which many critics found frustrating and too exacting.

25|$|He {{received}} his first national exposure for his daily roundup of the O.J. Simpson trial. After that, {{he continued to}} host his regular show on WLS (AM).

In 2004, amid an impasse in contract negotiations with the station, Meier did not renew his contract with WLS. Roe then became the sole host of the show, which also featured Jim Johnson and Christina Filiaggi. Many praise Roe Conn for having a good <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> for being skilled at articulating his thoughts.

25|$|Meredith Starr met Meher Baba in Toka, India on 30 June 1928. In 1931 Starr {{established}} a retreat center at East Challacombe, North Devon (a {{couple of miles}} from Combe Martin), where he invited Meher Baba to come and meet westerners. It was at the Devon retreat that many of Meher Baba's lasting followers from Europe and the United States first met Baba. Meredith was famously lacking in a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> had a particular sense of how spiritual conduct should be, thus enforcing strong codes of serious contemplative conduct that made even Meher Baba uncomfortable. Yet he is considered to have {{played a central role}} in introducing Meher Baba to the western world.|$|E
25|$|Controversy was {{prompted}} in 1987 {{with the arrival}} of Cindy Parker (Ellen Wheeler), who would later fall in love with Stuart. The character was revealed to have AIDS. Through visits by now-Dr. Angie Hubbard, the show educated the public on how the disease was spread and how to prevent it. Cindy had contracted HIV from her husband, Fred, played by Mark Morrison who contracted it from sharing needles for drug use. Cindy is attacked by a vigilante hate group led by her niece, Skye Chandler. The tragedy of the attack shows the extremes of violence that occur every day to victims of the disease. Cindy marries Stuart and he adopts her son, Scott. She dies early in 1989 in one of the show's most watched episodes. ABC wanted changes at All My Children. The show was getting about 6.5 million viewers per episode, but there sentiment that the program had lost its unique <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> was simply copying other soaps with action/adventure storylines. Efforts were made to bring the show back to the glory days of the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Pope Paul VI faced {{criticism}} {{throughout his}} papacy from both traditionalists and liberals for steering a middle course during Vatican II {{and in the}} course of the implementation of its reforms thereafter. His passion for peace during the Vietnam War was not understood by all. The urgent task of overcoming World poverty and start real development resulted partly in benign neglect of papal teachings by the influential and the rich. On basic Church teachings, this pope was unwavering. On the tenth anniversary of Humanae Vitae, he strongly reconfirmed his teachings. In his style and methodology, he was a disciple of Pius XII, whom he deeply revered. He suffered under the attacks of his predecessor for his alleged silences, knowing from personal association with the late pope the real concerns and compassion of Pius XII. Pope Paul is not credited to have had the encyclopaedic culture of Pius XII, nor his phenomenal memory, his amazing gift for languages, his brilliant style in writing, nor did he have the Charisma and outpouring love, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>and</b> human warmth of John XXIII. He took on himself the unfinished reform work of these two popes, bringing them diligently with great humility and common sense and without much fanfare to conclusion. In doing so, Paul VI saw himself following in the footsteps of the Apostle Paul, torn to several directions as Saint Paul, who always said, I am attracted to two sides at once, because the Cross always divides.|$|E
