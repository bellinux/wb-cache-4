40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{integration}} problems associated with tin dioxide thin film to meet the requirement of silicon IC processing. Since aluminum is being used as interconnection metal lines in various IC devices, the post annealing of tin dioxide thin film cannot be performed at high temperatures. At higher annealing temperature, the aluminum diffuses into the silicon and forms a metal alloy, which reduces {{the performance of the}} device. To overcome this problem, we propose an annealing process for the tin dioxide thin film at 450 degrees C in oxygen ambience for shorter time (15 min) and then quenching at room temperature. The performance, such as sensitivity and response time of the <b>quenched</b> <b>device,</b> is better than that of the device cooled at 50 degrees C/h. Sensor measurements were performed at 150 - 300 degrees C at 400 - 1000 ppm CO gas concentration, and stability of the devices was measured up to 720 h. The device was stable during long operation hours. Hydrogen gas was used to investigate the selectivity of the device. The response indicated that the <b>quenched</b> <b>device</b> was selective towards CO gas. The response of the <b>quenched</b> <b>device</b> was quite different towards CO and hydrogen gas.

40|$|International audienceFast {{evacuation}} of avalanche ions in Micromegas makes these detectors capable of withstanding very high rates with {{no loss of}} gain. But this intrinsic high-rate capability is often compromised by sporadic sparking which introduces dead time and is potentially harmful for the readout. Resistive electrode designs, by limiting spark current and keeping voltage drop locally, provide an effective remedy. They are thus quite popular, but there is actually more to them than simply spark attenuation. We propose that the spark probability is also drastically reduced because of charge-up of the resistive electrode surface. The underlying mechanism is a progressive reduction of field (in the region where spark-initiating avalanches develop) by the charges successively incoming onto the surface. We predict that the time constant with which the surface potential is relaxed {{is crucial to the}} success of this quenching mechanism. Small prototypes with a time constant varying over 5 orders of magnitude were built to verify this model. During tests in a high intensity hadron beam, <b>spark</b> <b>quenching</b> was observed for time constants larger than roughly 1 - 10 ns, corresponding to the avalanche timescale in Micromegas. These findings shed light on the basic mechanism of <b>spark</b> <b>quenching</b> in resistive detectors.

40|$|Equipe MicromegasInternational audienceMicromegas, as a {{proportional}} {{and compact}} gaseous detector, {{can be used}} as an active medium in a sampling calorimeter. Moreover, its readout plane can be finely segmented to perform Particle Flow reconstruction of jets at a future linear collider or high luminosity LHC experiment. For this application, sparks that would result from the potentially very large ionisation released in the gas during a shower can be avoided by means of resistive eletrodes. By slowing down the charge evacuation to ground through an RC-network, they allow a field reduction when the avalanche grows too large. While this mechanism efficiently <b>quenches</b> <b>sparks,</b> it might compromise the Micromegas intrinsic proportionality and the overall calorimeter response linearity. A study was conducted to determine the resistive configuration that best suppresses sparks and preserves proportionality. Several configurations were implemented on small prototypes, with a resistivity varying over five orders of magnitude. Charging of the resistive electrodes depends on the detector current, therefore the gain dependence on the rate and the dependence on the charge density (or dE/dx) were examined separately. Then, the <b>spark</b> <b>quenching</b> efficiency was assessed in a high intensity hadron beam used to generate showers that propagate through the prototypes.

In this master thesis in situ heat treatment and quenching experiments have been combined with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) inside a field emission scanning electron microscope in order to simulate a second weld cycle simulation. In conjunction with this a <b>quenching</b> <b>device</b> has been designed with respect to an existing hot stage. Inside the SEM, it was found difficult to recreate the characteristic microstructure of API X 70 steel from a traditional second cycle thermal weld simulation.

As a result of the gas quenching substantial amounts of oxide contamination, covered the sample surface following the experiments. This contamination layer produced artifacts, such as unreasonable amounts of austenite in the EBSD phase maps. Despite the quenching, islands of austenite (FCC) observed at elevated temperatures transformed into a low strain BCC structure. Some austenite islands showed a memory- effect during phase transformation, while others adapted the orientation of the surround- ing structure. No retained austenite was observed in the API X 70 steel after the in situ gas quenching, probably due to insufficient cooling rates. </p...|$|R

RF-thermal plasmas could respond to both criteria as it is a continuous process achieving high production volume while ensuring a good synthesis control from the gaseous phase. The absence of electrodes for igniting the plasma and the controlled process atmosphere of RF-plasmas are beneficial for producing high purity materials. Typically a supersaturated gaseous phase containing the precursor is condensed rapidly after nucleation took place. The nanoparticles grow then subsequently by coagulation and coalescence.

The sulfide melt – silicate melt partitioning of metals can be expressed by an exchange equation of the form: MO + 0. 5 S 2 = MS + 0. 5 O 2.

In the first case, the AC current in the {{condenser}} [...] {{is much smaller}} than the DC supply current , and the arc is never extinguished during an output cycle. The Duddell arc {{is an example of the}} first case, but the first case is not practical for RF transmitters. In the second case, the condenser AC discharge current is large enough to extinguish the arc but not large enough to restart the arc in the opposite direction. This second case is the Poulsen arc. In the third case, the arc extinguishes but may reignite when the condenser current reverses. The third case is a <b>quenched</b> <b>spark</b> gap and produces damped oscillations.|$|R
