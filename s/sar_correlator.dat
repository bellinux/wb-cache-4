40|$|An {{automated}} post-processing {{system has}} been developed for rectification and geocoding of SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery. The system uses as input a raw uncorrected image from the operational <b>SAR</b> <b>correlator,</b> and produces as a standard output a rectified and geocoded product. The accurate geolocation of SAR image pixels is provided by a spatial transformation model which maps the slant range-azimuth SAR image pixels into their location on a prespecified map grid. This model predicts the geodetic location of each pixel by utilizing: the sensor platform position; a geoid model; {{the parameters of the}} data collection system and the processing parameters used in the <b>SAR</b> <b>correlator.</b> Based on their geodetic locations, the pixels are mapped by using the desired cartographic projection equations. This rectification and geocoding technique has been tested with Seasat and SIR-B images. The test results demonstrate absolute location uncertainty of less than 50 m and relative distortion (scale factor and skew) of less than 0. 1 percent relative to local variations from the assumed geoid...|$|E
40|$|A {{new digital}} {{processing}} algorithm {{based on the}} fast polynomial transform is developed for producing images from Synthetic Aperture Radar data. This algorithm enables the computation of the two dimensional cyclic correlation of the raw echo data with the impulse response of a point target, thereby reducing distortions inherent in one dimensional transforms. This SAR processing technique was evaluated on a general-purpose computer and an actual Seasat SAR image was produced. However, regular production runs will require a dedicated facility. It is expected that such a new SAR processing algorithm could {{provide the basis for}} a real-time <b>SAR</b> <b>correlator</b> implementation in the Deep Space Network. Previously announced in STAR as N 82 - 1129...|$|E
40|$|Applications of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{technology}} to the observation of coastal zones phenomena are detailed. The conditions observed include gravity wave detection, surf zone location, surface currents, and long-period 'surf beats'. Algorithms have been developed and successfully tested that determine significant wave and current parameters from the sea surface backscatter of microwave energy. Doppler information from the <b>SAR</b> optical <b>correlator</b> allows a rough estimation of near shore surface flow velocities that {{has been found in}} agreement with both theory and in situ observations as well. Seasat SAR data of the Scotland and North Carolina coasts are considered, as well as the results of bathymetric updating of coastal area charts...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} for producing radiometrically calibrated SAR image products is described. The output imagery is corrected {{to represent a}} measurement of the ground reflectivity or radar cross section. The sources of calibration errors are discussed and the appropriate forms of the radar equation as applied to SAR-image data are reviewed. A key result is the radar equation dependence on the azimuth reference function used in processing. A radiometric correction algorithm for use in an operational <b>SAR</b> <b>correlator</b> is presented. This algorithm has the characteristic that it is fully reversible. Additionally, it can be applied equally to detected or complex SAR images, and it allows for the subtraction of the estimated noise floor in the image but does not require this procedure...|$|E
40|$|An {{automated}} post-processing {{system has}} been developed that interfaces with the raw image output of the operational digital <b>SAR</b> <b>correlator.</b> This system is designed for optimal efficiency by using advanced signal processing hardware and an algorithm that requires no operator interaction, such as the determination of ground control points. The standard output is a geocoded image product (i. e. resampled to a specified map projection). The system is capable of producing multiframe mosaics for large-scale mapping by combining images in both the along-track direction and adjacent cross-track swaths from ascending and descending passes over the same target area. The output products have absolute location uncertainty of less than 50 m and relative distortion (scale factor and skew) of less than 0. 1 per cent relative to local variations from the assumed geoid...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} results of a {{collaborative}} project on parallel processing of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, carried out between the NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and Intel Scalable Systems Division (SSD). Through this collaborative e ort, we have successfully parallelized the most compute-intensive <b>SAR</b> <b>correlator</b> phase of the Spaceborne Shuttle Imaging Radar-C/X-Band SAR (SIR-C/X-SAR) code, for the Intel Paragon. We describe the data decomposition, the scalable high-performance I/O model, and the node-level optimizations which enable us to obtain e cient processing throughput. In particular, we point out an interesting double level of parallelization arising in the data decomposition which increases substantially our ability to support volume " SAR. Results are presented from this code running in parallel on the Intel Paragon. A representative set of SAR data, of size 800 Megabytes, which was collected by the SIR-C/X-SAR instrument aboard NASA's Space Shuttle in 15 seconds, is processed in 55 seconds on the Concurrent Supercomputing Consortium's Paragon XP/S 35 +. This compares well with atimeof 12 minutes for the current SIR-C/X-SAR processing system at JPL. For the rst time, a commercial system ca...|$|E
40|$|MAPJTC was {{designed}} to rectify and transform the standard image output of the digital Synthetic Aperture Radar (<b>SAR)</b> <b>correlator</b> into a geocoded map registered image without operator interaction or manual tiepointing. This is accomplished by modeling the distortions and predicting the pixel displacements based on platform and radar parameters. The map projection implemented in MAPJTC is the Universal Transverse Mercator. Since the re-sampling operation is independent of the transformation data generation, other cartographic projections can be implemented with few software modifications. MAPJTC makes a precise determination of the geodetic location of an arbitrary pixel within the image frame based on the simultaneous solution {{of a set of}} earth model equations, SAR Doppler equations, and SAR range equations that identify the slant range from the sensor to the target at a specific image pixel. Based on a table of geodetic coordinates of the image pixels, the image is then mapped onto the desired cartographic projection by applying the appropriate transformation equations. Typically, mapping involves a two-dimensional re-sampling and is very computationally intensive. MAPJTC reduces the procedure to two one-dimensional passes, which saves computer time. Geocoding transforms the rectified image into a grid defined by a specific map projection. (The image is rotated and rectified to match the map projection.) Again, the two dimensional re-sampling process can be separated into two one-dimensional re-sampling processes. Optionally, MAPJTC can correct terrain-induced distortions in SAR imagery when a digital elevation map is available. MAPJTC was developed on a DEC VAX 11 / 785 under VMS 4. 5. The program is written in FORTRAN (84 %), APAL (2 %), and MAXL (14 %). It requires 6 Mb of memory and a Floating Point Systems AP- 5210 Array Processor equipped with 1 Mb of memory. MAPJTC can run interactively or as a batch job. MAPJTC was developed in 1987...|$|E
