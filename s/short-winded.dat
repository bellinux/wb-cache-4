2500|$|On March 89, 1862, at the Battle of Hampton Roads, the Confederate {{flotilla}} {{tried to}} break a blockade maintained by two wooden Union frigates, the USS Cumberland and the USS Congress. The Union ships were escorted by some gunboats and backed by shore batteries. Buchanan wrote later: [...] "The general order under which the gunboat squadron went into action required that, {{in the absence of}} all signals, each commanding officer was to exercise his own judgment and discretion in doing all the damage he could to the enemy and to sink before surrendering." [...] To support the CSS Virginia in this action, Capt. John Randolph Tucker, commanding the rest of the James River Squadron, ran past the shore batteries to join the battle, with the CSS Teaser [...] "puffing with all the energy of a <b>short-winded</b> tug." [...] They arrived just as the CSS Virginia had managed to sink the USS Cumberland.|$|E

6000|$|On {{descending}} {{from the}} hansom at the [...] "Currency Lass," [...] Hadden was struck {{with the appearance}} of the cabman, a gross, salt-looking man, red-faced, blue-eyed, short-handed and <b>short-winded,</b> perhaps nearing forty.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{so fond of}} dancing," [...] pleaded Mrs. Peagrim. Recovering some of her breath, {{she gazed}} at her {{companion}} {{with a sort of}} <b>short-winded</b> archness. [...] "You are always so sympathetic, Major Selby." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} would do, for he's too old for long rides, and too <b>short-winded.</b> Now, Stephen, I'm {{not going to run}} down this hill. We must take it easy, for it's far too steep." ...|$|E
60|$|Not {{without a}} sense of injury in the remembrance, the Tinker gloomily closed his eyes. Mr. Traveller, deeming the Tinker a <b>short-winded</b> one, from whom no further breath of {{information}} was to be derived, betook himself to the gate.|$|E
60|$|We next {{consulted}} the butcher, who {{agreed that the}} prize-ring method was absurd, especially when recommended to a <b>short-winded,</b> elderly family man, and who recommended, instead, plenty of out-door exercise for the dog, under my uncle's strict supervision and control.|$|E
6000|$|With a whoop and a yell, and {{a scream}} and a shout, [...] At once the whole murderous body turned out; [...] And swift as the hawk pounces {{down on the}} pigeon, [...] Pursued the poor <b>short-winded</b> men of religion.|$|E
60|$|Q. Why, {{are there}} {{many kinds of}} faith?--A. Yes. There is a faith that will stand with a heart as hard as a rock; a <b>short-winded</b> faith, which dureth for a while, and in time of temptation such fall away (Luke 8:13).|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} be {{infinitely}} happy {{at the prospect of}} meeting an honorable countryman in this Sir Brown," [...] observed the <b>short-winded</b> podest√†, who usually put himself out of breath both in ascending and descending the steep street, [...] "for he really seems determined to anchor in our bay, Signor Smees." ...|$|E
60|$|So, too, an {{exceptionally}} stout and <b>short-winded</b> old gentleman, who {{looks as if}} he had been living too well and taking too little exercise for the last forty-five years, is not the heavy father, as you might imagine if you judged from mere external evidence, but a wild, reckless boy.|$|E
60|$|Saying so, he ran up-stairs, {{followed}} by Mrs. Tugby; while Mr. Tugby panted and grumbled after them at leisure: being rendered more than commonly <b>short-winded</b> {{by the weight}} of the till, in which there had been an inconvenient quantity of copper. Trotty, with the child beside him, floated up the staircase like mere air.|$|E
60|$|If he be of a stout and <b>short-winded</b> build, you {{can easily}} avoid his advances; but, when he is of the {{youthful}} and long-legged type, a meeting is inevitable. The interview is, however, extremely brief, most of the conversation being on his part, your remarks being mostly of an exclamatory and mono-syllabic order, {{and as soon as}} you can tear yourself away you do so.|$|E
6000|$|I left Salem House {{upon the}} morrow afternoon. I little thought then that I left it, never to return. We {{travelled}} very slowly all night, {{and did not}} get into Yarmouth before nine or ten o'clock in the morning. I looked out for Mr. Barkis, {{but he was not}} there; and instead of him a fat, <b>short-winded,</b> merry-looking, little old man in black, with rusty little bunches of ribbons at the knees of his breeches, black stockings, and a broad-brimmed hat, came puffing up to the coach window, and said: ...|$|E
60|$|But good Sir, why so <b>short-winded?</b> {{why could}} not {{you make the}} same work with the other scriptures, as you did with these? I must leave them upon you unanswered; and {{standing}} by my argument conclude, That if laws and ordinances of old have been broken, and the breach of them born with, when yet the observation of outward things was more strictly commanded than now, if the profit and edification of the church come in competition; how much more, may not we have communion, church communion, when no law of God is transgressed thereby. And note, That all this while I plead not, as you, for persons unprepared, but godly, and such as walk with God.|$|E
60|$|They {{had talked}} out nearly every {{particular}} of their return before they slept that night; they yarned away three hours {{over the first}} generous meal that {{any one of them}} had eaten for many weeks. Louis Napoleon stayed in the hut as a matter of course, and reposed with snores and choking upon Marjorie's sledge and within a yard of her. It struck her as she lay awake and listened that the housemaids in Sussex Square would have thought things a little congested for a lady's bedroom, and then she reflected that after all it wasn't much worse than a crowded carriage in an all-night train from Switzerland. She tried to count how many people there had been in that compartment, and failed. How stuffy that had been--the smell of cheese and all! And with that, after a dream that she was whaling and had harpooned a particularly <b>short-winded</b> whale she fell very peacefully into oblivion.|$|E
6000|$|... 3. The {{doctrine}} of perseverance is also cross to the flesh; {{which is not}} only to begin, but for to hold out, not only to bid fair, and to say, Would I had heaven, but so to know Christ, to put on Christ, and walk with Christ as to come to heaven. Indeed, it is no great matter to begin to look for heaven, to begin to seek the Lord, to begin to shun sin. O but it is a very great matter to continue with God's approbation! 'My servant Caleb,' saith God, is a man of 'another spirit, he hath followed me,' followed me always, he hath continually followed me, 'fully, he shall possess the land' (Num 14:24). Almost all the many thousands of the children of Israel in their generation, fell short of perseverance when they walked from Egypt towards the land of Canaan. Indeed they went to the work at first pretty willingly, but they were very <b>short-winded,</b> they were quickly out of breath, and in their hearts they turned back again into Egypt.|$|E

60|$|It was an {{excellent}} season for a run, for at that silent hour the streets were deserted, the air was cool, and the flying figure before him distinctly visible at a great distance, as it sped away, with a long gaunt shadow following at its heels. But the <b>short-winded</b> locksmith had no chance against a man of Sim's youth and spare figure, though the day had been when he could have run him down in no time. The space between them rapidly increased, and as the rays of the rising sun streamed upon Simon {{in the act of}} turning a distant corner, Gabriel Varden was fain to give up, and sit down on a doorstep to fetch his breath. Simon meanwhile, without once stopping, fled at the same degree of swiftness to The Boot, where, as he well knew, some of his company were lying, and at which respectable hostelry--for he had already acquired the distinction of being in great peril of the law--a friendly watch had been expecting him all night, and was even now on the look-out for his coming.|$|E
6000|$|... "Delighted {{to see you}} again, Mr. Stone," [...] {{she said}} in her rich, husky voice. She panted a little as she spoke, like a <b>short-winded</b> lap-dog. It was Mrs. Budge who, having read in the [...] "Daily Mirror" [...] that the Government needed peach stones--what they needed them for she never knew--had made the {{collection}} of peach stones her peculiar [...] "bit" [...] of war work. She had thirty-six peach trees in her walled garden, as well as four hot-houses in which trees could be forced, so {{that she was able to}} eat peaches practically the whole year round. In 1916 she ate 4200 peaches, and sent the stones to the Government. In 1917 the military authorities called up three of her gardeners, and what with this and the fact that it was a bad year for wall fruit, she only managed to eat 2900 peaches during that crucial period of the national destinies. In 1918 she did rather better, for between January 1st and the date of the Armistice she ate 3300 peaches. Since the Armistice she had relaxed her efforts; now she did not eat more than two or three peaches a day. Her constitution, she complained, had suffered; but it had suffered for a good cause.|$|E
60|$|It is {{said that}} the terrible Cornish giant, or ogre, Tregeagle, was trudging homewards one day, {{carrying}} a huge sack of sand on his back, which--being a giant of neat and cleanly habits--he designed should serve him for sprinkling his parlour floor. As he was passing {{along the top of}} the hills which now overlook Loo Pool, he heard a sound of scampering footsteps behind him; and, turning round, saw that he was hotly pursued by no less a person than the devil himself. Big as he was, Tregeagle lost heart and ignominiously took to his heels: but the devil ran nimbly, ran steadily, ran without losing breath--ran, in short, like the devil. Tregeagle was fat, <b>short-winded,</b> had a load on his back, and lost ground at every step. At last, just as he reached the seaward extremity of the hills, he determined in despair to lighten himself of his burden, and thus to seize the only chance of escaping his enemy by superior fleetness of foot. Accordingly, he opened his huge sack in a great hurry, shook out all his sand over the precipice, between the sea and the river which then ran into it, and so formed in a moment the Bar of Loo Pool.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR BAXTER, - By {{the date}} you may perhaps {{understand}} the purport of my letter without any words wasted about the matter. I cannot walk with you to-morrow, {{and you must}} not expect me. I came yesterday afternoon to Bridge of Allan, and have been very happy ever since, as every place is sanctified by the eighth sense, Memory. I walked up here this morning (three miles, TU-DIEU! a good stretch for me), and passed one of my favourite places in the world, and one that I very much affect in spirit when the body is tied down and brought immovably to anchor on a sickbed. It is a meadow and bank on a corner on the river, and is connected in my mind inseparably with Virgil's ECLOGUES. HIC CORULIS MISTOS INTER CONSEDIMUS ULMOS, or something very like that, the passage begins (only I know my <b>short-winded</b> Latinity must have come to grief over even this much of quotation); and here, to a wish, is just such a cavern as Menalcas might shelter himself withal from the bright noon, and, with his lips curled backward, pipe himself blue in the face, while MESSIEURS LES ARCADIENS would roll out those cloying hexameters that sing themselves in one's mouth to such a curious lifting chant.|$|E
6000|$|We read before {{of forty}} days' {{patience}}, {{and after that}} of seven days' patience; and that after the waters began to return from off the earth, and here again of seven days more. Whence not, That the best of God's people, in the times of trials, find their patience too <b>short-winded</b> to hold out the whole length of a trial, unless the time be, as it were, cut in pieces. The prophet when he was to lay siege against Jerusalem, he must rest the one side, by turning him upon the other (Eze 4:2-6). It was with holy Job exceeding hard, when {{he might not have}} time to swallow his spittle, when he might not a little sit down and rest him. And if you observe him, he doth not desire an absolute deliverance as yet, but only time to take wind and breathe awhile; and then, if God will, to engage in the combat again:[36] [...] "How long [saith he] wilt thou not depart from me." [...] Depart: what quite? O! No, saith he, I beg not that absolutely, but only so long as till a man might [...] "swallow down his spittle" [...] (Job 7:19). This the church in Ezra's time took as an exceeding favour. [...] "And now [say they] for a little space, grace hath been shewed from the Lord our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage" [...] (Ezra 9:8).|$|E
60|$|The {{ship was}} now {{repeatedly}} hailed, but made no reply, and, passing by the fort, stood {{on up the}} Hudson. A gun was {{brought to bear on}} her, and, with some difficulty, loaded and fired by Hans Van Pelt, the garrison not being expert in artillery. The shot seemed absolutely to pass through the ship, and to skip along the water on the other side, but no notice was taken of it! What was strange, she had all her sails set, and sailed right against wind and tide, which were both down the river. Upon this Hans Van Pelt, who was likewise harbour-master, ordered his boat, and set off to board her; but after rowing two or three hours, he returned without success. Sometimes he would get within one or two hundred yards of her, and then, in a twinkling, she would be half a mile off. Some said it was because his oarsmen, who were rather pursy and <b>short-winded,</b> stopped every now and then to take breath, and spit on their hands; but this, it is probable, was a mere scandal. He got near enough, however, to see the crew; who were all dressed in the Dutch style, the officers in doublets and high hats and feathers: not a word was spoken by any one on board; they stood as motionless as so many statues, and the ship seemed as if left to her own government. Thus she kept on away up the river, lessening and lessening in the evening sunshine, until she faded from sight, like a little white cloud melting away in the summer sky.|$|E

5000|$|Even Stendhal's autobiographical works, such as The Life of Henry Brulard or Memoirs of an Egotist, are [...] "far more closely, essentially, and concretely {{connected}} with the politics, sociology, and economics of the period than are, for example, the corresponding works of Rousseau or Goethe; one feels that the great events of contemporary history affected Stendhal much more directly than they did the other two; Rousseau did not live to see them, and Goethe had managed to keep aloof from them." [...] Auerbach goes on to say: [...] We may ask ourselves how it came about that modern consciousness of reality began to find literary form {{for the first time}} precisely in Henri Beyle of Grenoble. Beyle-Stendhal was a man of keen intelligence, quick and alive, mentally independent and courageous, but not quite a great figure. His ideas are often forceful and inspired, but they are erratic, arbitrarily advanced, and, despite all their show of boldness, lacking in inward certainty and continuity. There is something unsettled about his whole nature: his fluctuation between realistic candor in general and silly mystification in particulars, between cold self-control, rapturous abandonment to sensual pleasures, and insecure and sometimes sentimental vaingloriousness, is not always easy to put up with; his literary style is very impressive and unmistakably original, but it is <b>short-winded,</b> not uniformly successful, and only seldom wholly takes possession of and fixes the subject. But, such as he was, he offered himself to the moment; circumstances seized him, tossed him about, and laid upon him a unique and unexpected destiny; they formed him so that he was compelled {{to come to terms with}} reality in a way which no one had done before him.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} quoted comments on judicial reform is the late New Jersey Chief Justice Arthur T. Vanderbilt‚Äôs remark, ‚ÄúJudicial reform is not for the <b>short-winded.</b> ‚Äù Vanderbilt‚Äôs remark illustrates a key point about judicial selection reform. Reforms do not occur simply because someone or some group in a state decides that change in the system of selection is desirable; rather, it is necessary for key interest groups in the judicial politics of a state to reach a sufficient political consensus that change can occur. A variety of factors may lead to such a consensus on the need for reform. In Oklahoma, for example, judicial reform came about {{as a result of a}} major scandal in the state‚Äôs judiciary. But in some states, consensus for change among key stakeholders is difficult. Key interest groups can have competing objectives, making judicial reform impossible. At other times, political conditions‚Äî the political environment of a state‚Äîlessen the chances of reform...|$|E

The green tea besides as a drinking, it has many virtues to be a medicine for some diseases (antioxidant). The pneumonia is an acute infection process, {{which is in the}} lungs (alveoli). There is some pneumonia symptoms, such as fever, <b>short-winded,</b> fast respiration and artery contraction, green phlegm-similiar to a rubber, and rotsen description that crowded in the lungs.

It is showed that the total of bacterial colony reduces because of the decoction of green tea (Camelia sinensis) that contains of antimicrobial substance, for example polifenol. The purpose of this research is to know the effectiveness of decoction of green tea (Camelia sinensis) toward the total of the bacterial colony Klebsiella pnemoniae through the in vitro way and to know the concentration of the green tea decoction (Camelia sinensis) that is most effective toward the total of the bacterial colony Klebsiella pneumoniae through the in vitro way.

40|$|Children like {{adults can}} benefit from {{physical}} activity. The recommendations for children are 60 minutes of activity at a moderate or high intensity daily. The physical activity can improve both the physical and mental health. Children with physical disability are disadvantaged {{when it comes to}} physical activity because of their disability. This can lead to poorer physical and mental health. The aim {{of this study was to}} chart how physical active children with physical disability are, investigate their health and to find if the children wanted to be more active. The design of the study was cross-sectional and included a questionnaire about physical activity and health. The participants were children with a physical disability at an age of 10 - 18 years. The results show that most of the participants are active at least once a week where they get sweaty or <b>short-winded.</b> The most important support for the participants to be active were adults close to the child. The biggest barrier were their own disabilities. There was no correlation between physical activity and health in this study. Several of the participants wanted to be more active. The activities that was most popular were daily activity, training in group and gym. In conclusion, children with physical disability are active but not as much as the recommendations says. Because adults close to the child, are the most important support for the children to be active, resources like information and education should be directed to the adults. With more knowledge about physical activity, adults close to the child can support the child to be more active...|$|E
