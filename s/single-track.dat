2500|$|As {{is typical}} of rail transit in the United States, MARTA's rail lines have two {{parallel}} tracks. Any train failure or track work results in shared use of the other track by trains going opposite directions, a situation known as <b>single-tracking.</b> There are no plans {{at this time to}} expand the number of tracks. MARTA is currently nearing the end of a complete replacement of tracks on all rail lines. [...] Over the past few years, this replacement work has caused the agency to implement <b>single-tracking</b> on the weekends, which in turn has caused weekend patrons to experience less-frequent service.|$|R
5|$|Work from Wimbledon to South Merton was {{completed}} quickly, so that services could begin {{running as a}} <b>single-track</b> operation on 7 July 1929. The remainder of the line opened on 5 January 1930, more than forty-five {{years after the first}} Wimbledon to Sutton link was proposed.|$|E
5|$|A pair of <b>single-track</b> tunnels at King's Cross {{connecting}} the GNR to the Met opened on 1 October 1863 when the GNR began running services, the GWR returning {{the same day}} with through suburban trains from such places as Windsor. By early autumn 1864 the Met had sufficient carriages and locomotives to run its own trains and increase the frequency to six trains an hour.|$|E
5|$|Bondi Junction had {{originally}} been intended only as an intermediate turnback station before the extension to Kingsford was abandoned. As part of the Rail Clearways Program, the $77 million Bondi Junction Turnback project saw a new rail crossover was built between the <b>single-track</b> tunnels, enabling 20 trains an hour, up from 14, to use the station. The work was completed {{in time for the}} introduction of a new timetable on 28 May 2006.|$|E

50|$|The Geelong to Ballarat line {{connected}} with the Geelong railway at North Geelong station, and when the 'direct line' from Ballarat to Melbourne was opened, it branched off at Warrenheip station. <b>Single-tracking</b> of the Geelong to Ballarat line commenced in 1892, but the majority remained double-tracked until 1934, when the 53-kilometre section from Bannockburn to Warrenheip was singled. In 1913 the Gheringhap-Maroona line was opened, junctioning with the line at Gheringhap.|$|R
5|$|On January 7, 2007, a Green Line train {{carrying}} approximately 120 people derailed {{near the}} Mount Vernon Square station in downtown Washington. Trains were <b>single-tracking</b> at the time, and the derailment {{of the fifth}} car occurred where the train was switching from the south to northbound track. The crash injured at least 18 people and prompted the rescue of 60 people from a tunnel. At least one person had a serious but non-life-threatening injury.|$|R
5|$|In April 1868, the Metropolitan & St John's Wood Railway (M) {{opened a}} <b>single-track</b> railway in tunnel to Swiss Cottage from new {{platforms}} at Baker Street (called Baker Street East). There were intermediate stations at St John's Wood Road and Marlborough Road, both with crossing loops, {{and the line}} was worked by the Met with a train every 20 minutes. A junction was built with the Inner Circle at Baker Street, {{but there were no}} through trains after 1869.|$|E
5|$|Several effects {{influence}} the steering angle, the angle {{at which the}} front assembly is rotated about the steering axis, necessary to maintain a steady-state turn. Some of these are unique to <b>single-track</b> vehicles, while others are also experienced by automobiles. Some of these may be mentioned elsewhere in this article, and they are repeated here, though not necessarily in order of importance, {{so that they may}} be found in one place.|$|E
5|$|The railway was rebuilt as a non-electrified, largely <b>single-track</b> line. Several {{surviving}} Waverley Route structures, including viaducts and tunnels, {{were rehabilitated}} and reused for the reopened railway. Passenger services run half-hourly on weekdays until 20:00, and hourly until 23:54 and on Sundays. The timetable also allows charter train promoters to run special excursion services, {{and for the}} weeks following the line opening scheduled steam trains were run.|$|E
50|$|Since {{ridership}} {{determines the}} scale of a rapid transit system, statistical modeling allows planners to size the rail system {{for the needs of}} the area. When the predicted ridership falls between the service requirements of a light rail and heavy rail or metro system, an MCS project is indicated. An MCS may also result when a rapid transit service fails to achieve the requisite ridership due to network inadequacies (e.g. <b>single-tracking)</b> or changing demographics.|$|R
50|$|Spring Ridge Trail {{runs from}} the Portola Valley trailhead to Skyline Boulevard through the open, grassy part of the preserve. It, {{like most of the}} lower trails, is a fire road, open to cyclists as well as hikers and equestrians. Two trails further to the south (Hamms Gulch and the Lost Trail-Razorback Ridge-Eagle Trail combination), are <b>single-tracks</b> not open to cyclists. These trails run through forested country: oak, fir, buckeye, bay laurel, madrone and one or two redwoods.|$|R
25|$|Since {{the tracks}} {{are on the}} outer part of the bridge, passing trains caused the {{structure}} to tilt and sway. The wobble worsened as train cars became longer and heavier. Eventually over years, when one train moved over the bridge one side would be three feet lower than the other side, severely damaging the structure. In 1956 {{at a cost of}} $30 million, a repair program was begun. Trains still crossed the bridge, but many times one of the tracks had to be closed with both routes <b>single-tracking,</b> further restricting the number and size of the trains crossing.|$|R
5|$|The seventh line in Preston was the North Unionâ€™s own Victoria Quay Branch to Victoria Quay on the River Ribble (later {{extended}} to Preston Docks in 1882 and which now {{connects to the}} heritage Ribble Steam Railway). The <b>single-track</b> goods line opened in October 1846 from a south-facing junction immediately south of Preston Station, through a tight curve into a tunnel with a gradient of 1 in 29, emerging north of Fishergate Hill near the riverside.|$|E
5|$|After {{the branch}} north of Fort Totten opened, the Green Line Commuter Shortcut {{began as a}} six-month {{experiment}} on January 27, 1997, allowing passengers {{to get on a}} train on the Green Line segment during rush hours and travel as far as Farragut North on the Red Line without having to switch trains at Fort Totten; a transfer was needed during off-peak hours. This was accomplished by utilizing a <b>single-track</b> spur (B & E connection) between the Green and Red Lines near (and bypassing) Fort Totten station. This shortcut was so well-received that it was continued until September 17, 1999, when the mid-city portion of the Green Line was completed.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} early 1847, but {{relationships}} between the LB and SER broke down quickly. The SER were unhappy about the proposed line from Rye to Hastings via , which they viewed as too expensive compared to the alternative route via Whatlington. The LB objected to this route as it was longer, and consequently the SER dropped their proposals in November 1847. The land over Romney Marsh was unstable, and test trains were seen to tip over in heavy winds. The line was originally proposed to be <b>single-track,</b> though this was changed to double-track in June 1850.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, RTA {{undertook}} a complete {{renovation of the}} Green and Blue Lines, with new track, ballast, poles and overhead wiring. Existing stations were demolished and new stations constructed. The project necessitated closing the Green Line east of Shaker Square {{for most of the}} summer of 1980 and the Blue Line east of Shaker Square for most of the summer of 1981, with substitute bus shuttles and <b>single-tracking</b> along the remainder of the line from East 55th Street to Shaker Square. To run on the renovated lines, a fleet of new LRVs were purchased from an Italian firm, Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie, to replace the aging PCC cars. The new lines were dedicated on October 30, 1981.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSolar {{tracking}} {{allows the}} increment {{of the electric}} production of photovoltaic modules; single-tracker systems can increase the collected solar radiation by 30 % more than traditional fixed devices. Usually, mechanical movement systems are energy intensive and require periodic maintenance, with correspondent higher investment costs compared to traditional fixed plants. In this paper, particular <b>single-tracking</b> PV modules with reduced width and weight moved by low power actuators, are considered. Two different control strategies concerning the rotation angle of modules around a horizontal tilted axis, have been investigated. With reference to typical climatic data of south Italy, {{the problem of the}} modules self-shading has been analysed by evaluating the optimal layout of the whole system in order to optimize energy production...|$|R
50|$|In July 2009, {{two teenage}} boys {{were struck by}} a light rail train near Lutherville station. The boys were likely unaware of <b>single-tracking,</b> which caused a train {{to come from the}} {{opposite}} direction than they would have expected. Two operators were fired and six other employees disciplined in December 2009, but it remained unclear whether the deaths could have been prevented by the operators following proper procedures. MTA instituted new regulations pertaining to trespassing on light rail tracks {{as a result of the}} deaths. These include strictly enforcing the existing trespassing laws, alerting police immediately if someone is spotted on or near the light rail tracks, and enforcing speed regulations on trains until the trespasser is removed.|$|R
5|$|The District {{also had}} {{parliamentary}} permission to extend westward from Brompton and, on 12 April 1869, it opened a <b>single-track</b> line to West Brompton on the WLR. There were no intermediate stations {{and at first}} this service operated as a shuttle. By summer 1869 separate tracks had been laid between South Kensington and Brompton and from Kensington (High Street) to a junction with the line to West Brompton. During the night of 5 July 1870 the District secretly built the disputed Cromwell curve connecting Brompton and Kensington (High Street).|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of Toronto in the east, in the 19th century, {{led to the}} development of housing stock along the Kingston Road and Danforth Road corridors in Scarborough. This led to the creation of a transit line. In 1893, the Toronto and Scarboro' Electric Railway, Light and Power Company built a <b>single-track</b> radial line along Kingston Road to Blantyre. Over the next 13 years this was extended to West Hill. In 1904, the line became the Scarboro Division of the Toronto and York Radial Railway. Service continued along this line until 1936 when it was replaced by bus service.|$|E
5|$|The {{only time}} the Red Line shared tracks with another line was from January 27, 1997 to September 17, 1999, when the Green Line Commuter Shortcut used Red Line tracks from Brooklandâ€“CUA to Farragut North. A short {{time after the}} Green Line branch north of Fort Totten opened in the early 1990s, the Green Line Commuter Shortcut began as a six-month experiment. Passengers could board the Green Line between Greenbelt and West Hyattsville and travel as far as Farragut North without having to transfer; the trains {{bypassed}} Fort Totten via a <b>single-track</b> spur between the West Hyattsville and Brooklandâ€“CUA stations. Due to its success, the shortcut continued until the mid-city portion of the Green Line was completed in 1999.|$|E

Expanded service was provided when the Mets played home games or when there were sporting events in Flushing Meadowsâ€“Corona Park. Paradoxically, Flushing local trains had better on-time performance during the construction than before it started.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the train rescheduling problem due to disturbances. The train rescheduling problem {{discussed in this}} paper is taken from a real train network of DAOP II Bandung in Jawa, Indonesia. The train network consists of block sections including unidirectional double-tracks and bidirectional <b>single-tracks.</b> There are some connections among trains because they use same rolling stocks. A mixed integer linear programming model is formulated to represent the problem. Main decision variables of the model are new departure and arrival times due to the disturbance. The objective function to be minimized is the total weighted delay. The model is examined using a hypothetical instance for four disturbance cases. Numerical experiments show that the model can represent the problem under stud...|$|R
5|$|As the Brookwood {{site had}} been {{intentionally}} chosen for its distance from London, {{at the time}} of its opening the only practical way to reach the cemetery was by railway. William Cubitt decided that the terrain of the initial cemetery site was best suited to a railway branch from the LSWR at the west of the cemetery, and work began on the earthworks and rails for the new branch in early September 1854. The <b>single-track</b> branch was completed in time for the opening two months later. The junction with the LSWR, known as Necropolis Junction, was west-facing, meaning that trains to and from London were obliged to reverse in and out of the branch to the two stations in the cemetery. The poor quality gravel soil, which had been the initial reason for the site's cheapness and its selection as the site for the cemetery, was poorly suited as a railway trackbed. The rails, and in particular the sleepers, deteriorated rapidly and needed constantly to be replaced.|$|E
5|$|Bicycles and {{motorcycles}} {{are both}} <b>single-track</b> vehicles and so their motions have many fundamental attributes in common and are {{fundamentally different from}} {{and more difficult to}} study than other wheeled vehicles such as dicycles, tricycles, and quadracycles. As with unicycles, bikes lack lateral stability when stationary, and under most circumstances can only remain upright when moving forward. Experimentation and mathematical analysis have shown that a bike stays upright when it is steered to keep its center of mass over its wheels. This steering is usually supplied by a rider, or in certain circumstances, by the bike itself. Several factors, including geometry, mass distribution, and gyroscopic effect all contribute in varying degrees to this self-stability, but long-standing hypotheses and claims that any single effect, such as gyroscopic or trail, is solely responsible for the stabilizing force have been discredited.|$|E
5|$|Milnrow Metrolink {{station is}} on the Oldham and Rochdale Line with tram {{services}} operating every 12 minutes. It was previously a railway station on the Oldham Loop Line which connected Manchester, Oldham and Rochdale. The station was constructed in 1862 by navvies drafted by contractors under the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. On 12 August 1863, the line was opened to commercial traffic and 2 November 1863, to passenger trains. Milnrow station was originally staffed, and the line through it was dual-track; however this section was reduced to <b>single-track</b> in 1980. Milnrow railway station closed on 3 October 2009 to be converted for use with an expanded Metrolink network. The station reopened on 28 February 2013 as Milnrow Metrolink station; also opening {{at this time in}} the Milnrow area was Kingsway Metrolink station and Newhey Metrolink station.|$|E
