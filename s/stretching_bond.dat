40|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to reduce the cost}} of breakwaters, several {{elements}} have been developed. Examples are Accropodes, Tetrapods and concrete cubes. Previous tests were performed with armour layers consisting of a double layer of cubes. This study is based on a single layer of cubes. The great benefit of a single layer of cubes is that it reduces the total cost of concrete. Another benefit is that because of the shape, cubes are easy to prefabricate. Three important aspects considering the stability of a single armour layer of a breakwater consisting of concrete cubes are addressed: The influence of the wave steepness on the stqbility, the influence of the slope on the stability of the single armour layer, and the influence of the packing density on the stability of the single armour layer. This study is based on a literature study and the results from a test program including a small-scale physical model tests. All conclusions in this thesis have been based on model tests, in which the cubes were placed by hand and placed in a <b>stretching</b> <b>bond</b> (half-steensverband).

There are two types of the C–C bonds that are parallel and oblique to the applied loading direction as shown in Fig.  1. Twenty C–C bonds are randomly selected for each type, and their lengths are averaged. The standard deviation of the C–C bonds length for 20 samples is calculated as 0.0002, showing a uniform variation.

The pressure dependent {{variation of the}} Ag and B 2 g bending modes from the O-Ce-O unit is suppressed when the proton conductor is hydrated, affecting directly the proton transfer by locally changing the electron density of the oxygen ions. Compressive strain causes a hardening of the Ce-O <b>stretching</b> <b>bond.</b> The activation barrier for proton conductivity is raised, in line with recent findings using high pressure and high temperature impedance spectroscopy. The increasing Raman frequency of the B 1 g and B 3 g modes thus implies that the phonons become hardened and increase the vibration energy in the a-c crystal plane upon compressive strain, whereas phonons are relaxed in the b-axis, and thus reveal softening of the Ag and B 2 g modes. Lattice toughening in the a-c crystal plane raises therefore a higher activation barrier for proton transfer and thus anisotropic conductivity.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{coupling}} between librational {{motions and}} rotational isomeric jumps in polymers is investigated. Librations originate from bond <b>stretching,</b> <b>bond</b> angle distortion, and small-amplitude {{fluctuations in the}} bond dihedral angles. Molecular dynamics trajectories for a polymer chain of 100 bonds in vacuo are used for assessing the contribution of librations to the dynamic behavior of chains. Each trajectory is resolved into two sets of components, low and high frequency, representing bond rotameric transitions and librations, respectively. Librational motions are observed to be strongly correlated with the rotational jumps of bonds between isomeric states. In fact, the passage from an isomeric state to another is accompanied by an enhancement in librational motions. Examination of the contribution of librations to the local relaxation behavior of polymers indicates that librations affect the mechanism of motion via two opposing effects. On the one hand, they provide an additional degree of freedom which causes a faster relaxation of the conformational correlation functions associated with the bond dihedral angles. On the other hand, the orientational correlation functions associated with the spatial reorientation of backbone bonds exhibit a slower time decay due to the compensating effect of librational motions. In fact, librational motions are not random but highly directed such that they collectively preserve local chain direction and help in accommodating the local reorientations induced by isomeric jumps, which would otherwise result in larger displacements of chain segments. Finally, it is shown that replacing the librations of a trajectory with random, uncorrelated fluctuations leads to an overestimation of the relaxation rate of configurational correlations...|$|E

Computational molecular simulation {{is one of the}} useful and important tools to study the protein interactions.

Plastic deformation, on the other hand, breaks inter-atomic bonds, and therefore involves the rearrangement of atoms in a solid material.|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} the deviation from size consistency of the multireference second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MRMP 2) method is presented. The size-consistency error is shown {{to depend on the}} number of monomers in a supermolecule calculation, size of basis set, number of correlated valence electrons, and size of active space. HF, F 2, and N 2 are used as test cases, with <b>stretched</b> <b>bonds,</b> to include simple, well-defined multireference character. This is essential in ensuring that MRMP 2 is being tested as a multireference method. It is concluded that the MRMP 2 and other multireference perturbation theory methods can exhibit significant size-consistency errors, and that the size of the error depends on {{the manner in which the}} perturbation theory is implemented...|$|R
