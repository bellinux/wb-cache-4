25|$|Unlike {{its modern}} counterpart, the office {{adjutant}} general during the 19th century {{was not necessarily}} viewed as a command position. While there are examples of adjutant generals assuming command in the field, {{as was the case}} during the Pecan Point Campaign, in general the role of the adjutant general was to act as the <b>military</b> <b>advisor</b> to the governor, conduct inspections and make reports to the commander-in-chief, (the governor) and to the War Department. The governor served as the commander-in-chief and the units were under the day-to-day command of the <b>senior</b> <b>military</b> commander. In the early territorial period, the <b>senior</b> <b>military</b> commander was a brigadier general appointed by the president. After the territorial militia had been divided into multiple brigades, and a division was formed, the senior commanders were major generals.
