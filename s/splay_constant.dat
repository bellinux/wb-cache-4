40|$|The nematic twist-bend (TB) phase, {{exhibited}} by certain achiral thermotropic liquid crystalline (LC) dimers, features a nanometer-scale, heliconical {{rotation of the}} average molecular long axis (director) with equally probable left- and right-handed domains. On meso to macroscopic scales, the TB phase may {{be considered as a}} stack of equivalent slabs or "pseudo-layers", each one helical pitch in thickness. The long wavelength fluctuation modes should then be analogous to those of a smectic-A phase, and in particular the hydrodynamic mode combining "layer" compression and bending ought to be characterized by an effective layer compression elastic constant B_eff and average director <b>splay</b> <b>constant</b> K_ 1 ^eff. The magnitude of K_ 1 ^eff is expected to be similar to the <b>splay</b> <b>constant</b> of an ordinary nematic LC, but due to the absence of a true mass density wave, B_eff could differ substantially from the typical value of ∼ 10 ^ 6 Pa in a conventional smectic-A. Here we report the results of a dynamic light scattering study, which confirms the "pseudo-layer" structure of the TB phase with B_eff in the range ∼ 10 ^ 3 - 10 ^ 4 Pa. We show additionally that the temperature dependence of B_eff at the TB to nematic transition is accurately described by a coarse-grained free energy density, which is based on a Landau-deGennes expansion in terms of a heli-polar order parameter that characterizes the TB state and is linearly coupled to bend distortion of the director.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{continuum}} theory for the statistical mechanics of thermally activated point defects in the nematic and hexagonal phases of polymer liquid crystals. In the nematic phase, there are elementary splay defects (chain ends and hairpins), {{and in the}} hexagonal phase, there are both splay defects and twist defects. In the nematic phase, splay defects are free {{in the limit of}} large separation; i. e., their binding energy is finite. By contrast, in the hexagonal phase, both types of defects are bound in +- pairs. We derive expressions for two correlation functions, the structure factor and the director fluctuation spectrum, in the presence of defects, and we use these correlation functions to define macroscopic Frank constants and elastic moduli. In the nematic phase, the presence of ionized splay defects causes the macroscopic <b>splay</b> <b>constant</b> K̂_ 1 to be finite. It is large and strongly temperature-dependent in the low-temperature regime, but smaller and temperature-independent in the higher-temperature Debye-Hückel regime. By contrast, in the hexagonal phase, the macroscopic splay and twist constants K̂_ 1 and K̂_ 2 are infinite, just as in harmonic theory. These effects should be observable in x-ray and light-scattering experiments on polymer liquid crystals...|$|E

If liquid crystals such as MBBA, having k 11 k 33, {{the sign of the}} thickness anomaly is reversed. If the average angle of surface attachment is not homeotropic or parallel, then {{in the absence of an}} applied field the tilt angle beyond the distorted surface region also depends on k 11 /k 33.

The dependence of the threshold values of the electric field and the spatial wavenumber of the distortion on the orienting magnetic field is described.

40|$|The splay {{and bend}} elastic {{constants}} of the bent-core oxadiazole material [C 5 -Ph-ODBP-Ph-OC 12] {{have been investigated}} {{as a function of}} temperature across the nematic phase. The bend constant K 33 is found to take values of ∼ 3. 0 pN and to be almost temperature independent, whereas, the <b>splay</b> <b>constant</b> K 11 increases monotonically from ∼ 3. 5 pN close to the isotropic phase transition to values of ∼ 9 pN deep in the nematic phase. No pretransitional divergence is observed in either K 11 or K 33 at temperatures approaching the underlying phase. This behavior of the elastic constants is distinct from that observed in rodlike liquid crystal systems but appears to share characteristics with the few other bent-core nematic systems studied to date. We discuss the interdependence of the elastic constants, the birefringence, and the order parameter to allow a comparison of the observed behavior with theory. We show that calculations of the elastic constants via molecular-field theory and atomistic modeling are in excellent qualitative as well as good quantitative (within 2 pN) agreement with the measurements across the temperature range, offering {{a deeper understanding of the}} elasticity in bent-core nematic materials than has been, hitherto, available...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} set of measurements of optical, dielectric, diamagnetic, elastic and viscous {{properties in the}} nematic (N) phase formed by a liquid crystalline dimer. The studied dimer, 1, 7 -bis- 4 -(4 -cyanobiphenyl) heptane (CB 7 CB), is composed of two rigid rod-like cyanobiphenyl segments connected by a flexible aliphatic link with seven methyl groups. CB 7 CB and other nematic dimers are of interest due to their tendency to adopt bent configurations and to form two states possessing a modulated nematic director structure, namely, the twist bend nematic, NTB, and the oblique helicoidal cholesteric, ChOH, which occurs when the achiral dimer is doped with a chiral additive and exposed to an external electric or magnetic field. We characterize the material parameters as functions of temperature in the entire temperature range of the N phase, including the pre-transitional regions near the N-NTB and N-to-isotropic (I) transitions. The <b>splay</b> <b>constant</b> K 11 is determined by two direct and independent techniques, namely, detection of the Frederiks transition and measurement of director fluctuation amplitudes by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The bend K 33 and twist K 22 constants are measured by DLS. K 33 being {{the smallest of the}} three constants, shows a strong non-monotonous temperature dependence with a negative slope in both N-I and N-NTB pretransitional regions. The measured ratio K 11 /K 22 is larger than 2 in the entire nematic temperature range. The orientational viscosities associated with splay, twist and bend fluctuations in the N phase are comparable to those of nematics formed by rod-like molecules. All three show strong temperature dependence, increasing sharply near the N-NTB transition...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a magnetic field on the shape and director field of nematic droplets in dispersions of sterically stabilized and charge-stabilized colloidal gibbsite platelets with a negative diamagnetic anisotropy. Depending on the magnetic field strength and tactoid size, we observe with polarized light microscopy several interesting structures, with different shapes and director fields both with and without defects. In particular, our findings provide the first experimental evidence for the existence of the split-core defect structure predicted ten years ago by Mkaddem and Gartland [Phys. Rev. E 62, 6694 (2000) ]. The split-core structure is a metastable director-field configuration that can be stabilized by a sufficiently strong externally applied magnetic field but only if the diamagnetic anisotropy of the particles is negative. To account for our observations, we present a calculation of the stability regions of different shapes and director-field structures as a function of tactoid size, anchoring conditions, surface tension, elastic constants, and magnetic field strength. By fitting the experimental data to the theoretically predicted structures, we are able to extract values for the <b>splay</b> elastic <b>constant,</b> interfacial tension, and anchoring strength. Remarkably, we find {{significant differences between the two}} systems studied: for sterically stabilized gibbsite in bromotoluene the anchoring strength is one order of magnitude larger than that of aqueous gibbsite, with the latter exhibiting weak and the former strong anchoring of the director field to the interface. The <b>splay</b> elastic <b>constants</b> that we obtain are in agreement with earlier experiments, simulations, and theory, while the interfacial tension and anchoring strength are considerably larger than what was found in earlier experiments...|$|R

It exhibits the positive dielectric and the negative elastic anisotropy. The optical and the thermal measurements show that all the transitions are first order. The rotational viscosity is comparatively higher than calamitic liquid crystals and exhibits weak pre-transitional divergence. The temperature dependent static dielectric measurements indicate antiparallel correlation of both the longitudinal and the transverse components of dipole moments in both the smectic phases. The parallel component of the dielectric constant exhibits a single Debye type relaxation in all the phases.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that the transition}} into the twist–bend nematic phase (NTB) is driven by an elastic instability related to {{the reduction of the}} bend elastic constant. Here we use a molecular–statistical theory to show that sufficiently strong polar interactions between bent–shaped molecules may lead to experimentally observed reduction of the bend elastic constant in the nematic phase even if electrostatic dipole-dipole interactions are not taken into account. We propose a simple model of bent–core particles and derive explicit analytical expressions which enable one to understand how polar molecular shape affects the elastic constants, and, in particular, the important role of the bend angle. Numerical graphs showing temperature variations of all elastic constants are also presented including the variation of the bend and <b>splay</b> elastic <b>constants</b> before and after the renormalization determined by local polar order of molecular steric dipoles and the corresponding polar correction to the one–particle distribution function...|$|R

The mixtures showed improved performance in birefringence and viscosity properties {{in comparison with}} the widely used commercial mixture E 7. As far as display performance is concerned, mixture D was found to be the most valuable. A comprehensive study of the usefulness of the biphenyl and terphenyl derivatives as dopants in mixtures has also been conducted with a view to improving their physical parameters to give faster electro-optical response times in liquid crystal display devices.

40|$|We studied, {{by means}} of {{polarized}} light microscopy, the shape and director field of nematic tactoids {{as a function of}} their size in dispersions of colloidal gibbsite platelets in polar and apolar solvents. Because of the homeotropic anchoring of the platelets to the interface, we found large tactoids to be spherical with a radial director field, whereas small tactoids turn out to have an oblate shape and a homogeneous director field, in accordance with theoretical predictions. The transition from a radial to a homogeneous director field seems to proceed via two different routes depending in our case on the solvent. In one route, the what presumably is a hedgehog point defect {{in the center of the}} tactoid transforms into a ring defect with a radius that presumably goes to infinity with decreasing drop size. In the other route, the hedgehog defect is displaced from the center to the edge of the tactoid, where it becomes virtual again going to infinity with decreasing drop size. Furthermore, quantitative analysis of the tactoid properties provides us with useful information on the ratio of the <b>splay</b> elastic <b>constant</b> and the anchoring strength and the ratio of the anchoring strength and the surface tension...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} snap-off of nematic liquid {{crystalline}} droplets originating from the Rayleigh–Taylor instability at the isotropic–nematic interface in suspensions of charged gibbsite {{in water and}} sterically stabilized gibbsite in bromotoluene. We found that droplet snap-off strongly depends on the director field structure inside the thinning neck, which {{is determined by the}} ratio of the <b>splay</b> elastic <b>constant</b> and the anchoring strength of the nematic phase to the droplet interface relative to the thickness of the thinning neck. If anchoring is weak, which is the case for aqueous gibbsite, this ratio is comparable to the thickness of the breaking thread. As a result, the thinning neck and pending drop have a uniform director field and droplet snap-off is determined by the viscous properties of the liquid crystal as well as by thermal fluctuations of the interface. On the other hand, in sterically stabilized gibbsite where anchoring is strong, this ratio is significantly smaller than the neck thickness. In this case, the neck has an escaped radial director field and the neck thinning is retarded close to snap-off due to a topological energy barrier involved in the separation of the droplet from the threa...|$|R

For {{efficient}} and high-performance liquid crystal (LC) devices, the physical {{properties of the}} LC materials can be suitably altered by incorporating nanomaterials like carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene and quantum dots. In the present work, the effect of incorporation of octadecylamine-functionalised single-walled carbon nanotubes (ODA-SWCNT) in a LC exhibiting nematic and smectic phases on its physical properties is investigated. The electro-optic threshold voltage in the nematic phase of ODA-SWCNT nanocomposite of LC is enhanced as {{compared to that of}} pure LC. The dielectric anisotropy as a function of reduced temperature decreases with an increase in the concentration of ODA-SWCNT. The ratio of bend to <b>splay</b> elastic <b>constants</b> of ODA-SWCNT nanocomposite of LC is enhanced considerably as compared to that of pure LC at low temperature. The electro-optic response rise time decreased and decay time increased at higher concentrations of ODA-SWCNT. The temperature range of smectic phase is increased with an increase in the concentration of ODA-SWCNT. At the lower concentration of ODA-SWCNTs (0. 05 wt%), the anchoring of the nanotubes at the LC–electrode interface is favoured. At higher concentration of the ODA-SWCNTs, in addition to the anchoring at the interface, the nanotubes that are dispersed in the LC medium increases the orientational ordering...|$|R
40|$|In culture {{migrating}} {{and interacting}} amoeboid cells can form nematic liquid crystal phases. A polar nematic liquid crystal is formed if the interaction has a polar symmetry. One type of {{white blood cells}} (granulocytes) form clusters where the cells are oriented towards the center. The core of such an orientational defect (disclination) is either a granulocyte forced {{to be in an}} isotropic state or another cell type like a monocyte. An apolar nematic liquid crystal is formed if the interaction has an apolar symmetry. Different cell types like human melanocytes (=pigment cells of the skin), human fibroblasts (=connective tissue cells), human osteoblasts (=bone cells), human adipocytes (= fat cells) etc., form an apolar nematic liquid crystal. The orientational elastic energy is derived and the orientational defects (disclination) of nematic liquid crystals are investigated. The existence of half-numbered disclinations show that the nematic phase has an apolar symmetry. The density- and order parameter dependence of the orientational elastic constants and their absolute values are estimated. From the defect structure, one finds that the <b>splay</b> elastic <b>constant</b> is smaller than the bend elastic constant (melanocytes).

40|$|The uniform {{director}} field {{obtained for}} the nematic ground state of the hard-rod model of liquid crystals in two dimensions reflects the high symmetry of the constituents of the liquid; It is {{a manifestation of the}} constituents' local tendency to avoid splaying and bending with respect to one another. In contrast, bent-core (or banana shaped) liquid-crystal-forming-molecules locally favor a state of zero <b>splay</b> and <b>constant</b> bend. However, such a structure cannot be realized in the plane and the resulting liquid-crystalline phase is frustrated and must exhibit some compromise of these two mutually contradicting local intrinsic tendencies. The generation of geometric frustration from the intrinsic geometry of the constituents of a material is not only natural and ubiquitous but also leads to a striking variety of morphologies of ground states and exotic response properties. In this work we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for two scalar functions, $s$ and $b$ to describe the splay and bend of a director field in the plane. We generalize these compatibility conditions for geometries with non-vanishing constant Gaussian curvature, and provide a reconstruction formula for the director field depending only on the splay and bend fields and their derivatives. Last, we discuss optimal compromises for simple incompatible cases where the locally preferred values of the splay and bend cannot be globally achieved...|$|R

Moreover, the decay towards these uniaxial states is radically different in the two cases: it is asymptotically exponential in the former, whereas it happens abruptly at a finite depth in the latter. There is precisely one surface biaxial distribution that induces bistability between these decay modes: {{it depends on the}} elastic constants in the Landau-de Gennes free energy functional.

In this paper the effect of weak-anchoring conditions on the critical r value and on the other parameters of interest is theoretically investigated. Analytical expressions between these parameters are given. It is shown that the periodic transition is not allowed in the range 0. 5 <r< 2. Outside this range either the periodic or aperiodic transition appears, according to the surface treatment, the sample thickness, and the direction of the magnetic field.

40|$|We use the Landau-de Gennes {{theory of}} a nematic liquid crystal to {{investigate}} anew {{aspects of the}} properties of the interface between the isotropic and nematic liquid crystal phases of the same fluid. The equations of the static interface have been solved, both numerically and using asymptotic analysis, with an emphasis on the effect of inclusion of the order parameter biaxiality on the physical properties. We have compared the results of the exact solutions to the commonly used de Gennes ansatz, which assumes positive and uniform unixiality through the interface. Although the de Gennes ansatz in general gives good results, when bend and <b>splay</b> elastic <b>constants</b> dominate over the twist constants, it can lead to errors of up to 10 % in the surface energy. The asymptotic analysis also shows that, by contrast with the de Gennes ansatz, the order parameter wings in the isotropic phase exhibit negative order parameter, with principal axis perpendicular to the surface. For moving interfaces, using an approximation which at this stage does not yet include hydrodynamic coupling, we have compared our results with the analogue of the de Gennes ansatz used by the present authors in an earlier paper. We find that including biaxiality leads to larger effects in the dynamic than in the static properties, and that whereas this is essentially a perturbation to the energy, the velocity of the moving interface can be significantly slowed down. The slowing down effects are strongly correlated with surface biaxiality, but both effects seem to be diminished when the isotropic phase is advancing...|$|R
40|$|The splay, twist, {{and bend}} elastic {{constants}} of an oxadiazole based bent-core liquid crystal have been measured as functions of temperature throughout the nematic phase. The <b>splay</b> elastic <b>constant</b> (K 11) behaves similarly to other bent-core systems, though it exhibits rather high values, varying between 8 - 14 pN. Further, anomalously low, temperature-independent values {{of both the}} twist and bend constants (K 22 and K 33) are found. The combination of such low values of both constants (~ 0. 15 pN and ~ 1. 2 pN) and temperature independence has not been observed in any type of nematic material previously. This unusual behaviour has been further investigated using two independent theoretical approaches; a molecular theory based on atomistic simulations of the real molecular structure and an analytical molecular-field theory. Computational calculations show good agreement with the experimental results for both the twist and bend constants. The statistical theory introduces a term related to chiral fluctuations that affects the twist constant, while the inclusion of polarity is known to explain low values of the bend constant. The additional terms enable one to understand {{the origin of the}} low values of both elastic constants and to describe their weak temperature dependence. It also offers an explanation for the spontaneous chiral segregation observed in some nematic bent-core systems.

The observed relaxation rates, R_ 2 ^CP(omega), exhibit a square root dependence on the inverse pulse frequency, omega, i. e., R_ 2 ^CP(omega) proportional to omega^(- 1 / 2), over more than one order of magnitude in omega in the kHz regime. This is precisely the dispersion law expected for nematic director fluctuations. Analysis of the experimental dispersion profile is performed using a slow-motional model for director fluctuations, in which five independent Leslie viscosities and three Frank elastic constants are considered. Using additional information from a step-rotation rheo-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment, the analysis provides absolute values for the splay, bend, and twist elastic constant of the studied LCP.

40|$|A {{generalized}} de Gennes {{model for}} the nematic to smectic-A transition with an N complex component order parameter, Ψ, is studied in the 1 /N expansion. This model {{is similar to the}} Landau-Ginzburg {{model for the}} superconducting transition with deviations, δn, of the director from its uniform equilibrium value, n 0, playing the role of the vector potential. It is, however, not gauge invariant, and properties of Ψ change under gauge transformations : ψ = Ψ eiqoL, A = δ n + ∇L. Phase fluctuations in ψ are a maximum in the physical (LC) gauge with δn 〉 n 0 and a minimum in the gauge (SC) with ∇. A = 0. A continuum of gauges parameterized by an angle θ with θ = 0 (θ = π/ 2) corresponding to the LC (SC) gauge is introduced. Isotropic and anisotropic critical behaviour is found as in the ε-expansion. Thermal critical exponents ν and α are independent of gauge. Magnetic exponents γ and η depend continuously on 0 for 0 < θ < π/ 2. The susceptibility χ LC in the LC gauge is related to that, χSC, in the SC gauge via χLC = χsc(exp g) where g is negative and more than logarithmically singular in reduced temperature, t, and wave number q near criticality because the <b>splay</b> elastic <b>constant</b> K 0 1 behaves as a dangerous irrelevant variable. Precursors of the smectic phase Landau-Peierls instability in three dimensions appear in g in the nematic phase. It is argued that this unusual behaviour of χ LC may be responsible for mosaicity seen in X-ray experiments...|$|R
40|$|The light {{scattering}} technique {{was used to}} investigate the viscoelastic parapeters characterizing director distortions in miscible mixtures of pentacyanobiphenyl (5 CB) with a side-chain liquid crystal polymer (LCP) having different spacer lengths (n= 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). To separate the elastic constants from the corresponding viscosities, two approaches were attempted: (a) an AC electric field was applied to homeotropically-aligned nematic monodomains of the mixtures, and the field-dependent scattering intensities and director distortion relaxation rates were measured to obtain the twist viscosity γ 1 and elastic constant K 22; (b) an electric field was applied to a homogeneously aligned monodomain and the votage-dependent capacitance and the threshold voltage were measured to obtain the dielectric <b>constants</b> and the <b>splay</b> elastic <b>constant.</b> The remaining <b>splay</b> viscosity, bend viscosity and bend elastic constant were subsequently determined by fitting the angular-dependent relaxation rates in three scattering geometries which correspond principally to splay, twist, and bend modes of the director distortions ofr nematic miwtures. The additin of liquid crystal polymers cause significant decreases of the relaxation rates for all three distortion modes of 5 CB which are due to small decreases in the elastic constants and large increases in the viscosity coefficients. The molecular weight dependence of the viscosities for n= 3 is weak. The largest increase in viscosities is found for the LCP with shortest spacer length n= 2. The dependence of viscosity on spacer length disappears when n≥ 5. The anisotropy in the three viscosity incrementsof the nematic mixtures also becomes smaller when n≥ 5. Our results indicate that, for side-chain LCPs in a nematic solvent, the backbone configurational anisotropy is enhanced by a strong coupling between the mesogenic group in the side-chain and the chain backbone...|$|R
