5000|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>casing</b> pipe protects one or many {{of various}} types of {{utilities}} such as water mains, gas pipes, electrical power cables, fiber optic cables, etc. The utility lines that are run through the <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> pipe are most commonly mounted and spaced within the <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> pipe by using [...] "casing spacers" [...] that are made of various materials, including stainless steel or carbon steel and the more economical plastic versions. The ends of a <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> pipe [...] "run" [...] are normally sealed with [...] "casing end seals", which can be of the [...] "pull-on" [...] or [...] "wrap-around" [...] rubber varieties. <b>Steel</b> <b>casing</b> pipe is also used {{in the construction of}} deep foundations.|$|R

50|$|HMX is {{also used}} {{in the process of}} {{perforating}} the <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> in oil and gas wells. The HMX is built into a shaped charge that is detonated within the wellbore to punch a hole through the <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> and surrounding cement out into the hydrocarbon bearing formations. The pathway that is created allows formation fluids to flow into the wellbore and onward to the surface.|$|R
40|$|The Crosswell {{electromagnetic}} (EM) induction technique ideally {{measures the}} resistivity distribution between boreholes which may often be cased with carbon steel. Quantification {{of the effect}} of such <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> on the induced field is the most significant limitation of the technique. Recent data acquired at a site in Richmond, California quantify the effect of <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> on induction measurements and demonstrate this effect to be separable. This unique site contains adjacent steel and plastic wells in which frequency soundings demonstrate low spectrum (1. 0 - 50 Hz) measurements an effective means of isolating the casing response from, the formation response. It is also shown that the <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> effect on the induction coil is highly localized, and limited to less than 0. 30 meters above and below the coil...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>casing</b> pipe {{is used in}} {{different}} types of horizontal underground boring, where the pipe is jacked into an augered hole in segments and then connected together by welding or by threaded and coupled ends, or other proprietary pipe connectors such as the interference-fit Permalok® interlocking push-on joint. The <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> pipe can also be set up and welded into a [...] "ribbon" [...] and then directionally pulled through a previously drilled hole under highways, railroads, lakes and rivers.|$|R
40|$|The seismic {{design of}} bridges {{may require a}} large-diameter deep pile {{foundation}} such as a cast-in-steel-shell (CISS) pile where a reinforced concrete (RC) member is cast in a <b>steel</b> <b>casing.</b> In practice, the <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> is not considered in the structural design and the pile {{is assumed to be}} an RC member. It is partially attributed to the difficulties in evaluation of composite action of a CISS pile. However, by considering benefits provided by composite action of the infilled concrete and the <b>steel</b> <b>casing,</b> both the cost and size of CISS pile can be reduced. In this study, the structural behavior of the RC pier and the CISS pile connection is simulated by using an advanced 3 D finite element (FE) method, where the interface between the steel and concrete is also modeled. Firstly, the FE model is verified. Then, the parametric study is conducted. The analysis results suggest that the embedment length and the friction coefficient between the <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> and the infilled concrete affect the structural behavior of the RC pier. Finally, the minimum embedment length with reference to the AASHTO design guideline is suggested considering the composite action of the CISS pile...|$|R

40|$|Electrical {{resistance}} tomography (ERT) {{using multiple}} electrodes installed in boreholes {{has been shown}} to be useful for both site characterization and process monitoring. In some cases, however, installing multiple downhole electrodes is too costly (e. g., deep targets) or risky (e. g., contaminated sites). For these cases we have examined the possibility of using the <b>steel</b> <b>casings</b> of existing boreholes as electrodes. Several possibilities can be considered. The first case we investigated uses an array of <b>steel</b> <b>casings</b> as electrodes. This results in very few data and thus requires additional constraints to limit the domain of possible inverse solutions. Simulations indicate that the spatial resolution and sensitivity are understandably low but it is possible to coarsely map the lateral extent of subsurface processes such as steam floods. The second case uses an array of traditional point borehole electrodes combined with long-conductor electrodes (<b>steel</b> <b>casings).</b> Although this arrangement provides more data, in many cases it results in poor reconstructions of test targets. Results indicate that this method may hold promise for low resolution imaging where <b>steel</b> <b>casings</b> can be used as electrodes but the merits depend strongly on details of each application. Field tests using these configurations are currently being conducted...|$|R

50|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>casing</b> pipe {{is often}} {{specified}} as ASTM A-252 {{which is a}} structural grade material that does not require hydrostatic testing and the inspection requirements are not stringent and it usually costs less than other grades such as A-53, A-139 or API 5L. Used natural gas line pipe is also used as casing on many projects because it is often reclaimed in very good condition and can offer a significant cost savings when compared to new steel pipe. Used pipe {{is most likely to}} not have any testing data associated with it and is generally used when the only required specification is a given diameter and wall thickness of <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> pipe.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Geostatistics {{is a very}} {{important}} tool of surface analysis in GIS application. Firstly, spatial dependency that represents the similar extent of neighboring points is used to analyze spatial data values and their locations. Spatial variability is calculated to assess spatial data in terms of distance and direction. Then, calculating results is used to create new surface images of spatial data values with kriging interpolating. As an example application, four sample data sets of oil wells, such as injection pressure, times of injection, injection temperature, and total injection, are analyzed. Predictive model of <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> failure is constructed with four surface images that represent influence factors. Finally, the predictive distribution of <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> failure is worked out, and some advice is proposed...|$|R
50|$|One {{advantage}} of these boilers was the rapidity with which they could be constructed. A factor in this was their pre-fabricated <b>steel</b> <b>casings</b> that were bolted together in sections. Although their potential for high pressure was not made use of, they did gain a reputation for reliability and long service between overhaul.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of industrially used centrifuges {{is limited by}} the tensile strength of stainless <b>steel</b> used as <b>casing</b> aterial in state-of-the-art centrifuges. A retaining ring made from carbonfiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) creates a hybrid casing, suitable for higher rotating speed. A slightly modified casing of the centrifuge is braced by a CFRP ring in a patented joining process. Due to the resulting residual stress the strain of the <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> is reduced and allows a further increase of rotating speed...|$|R

30|$|The granite {{sample was}} {{hydraulically}} fractured under unconfined conditions through a <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> to a target interval. The <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> depth was approximately 100  mm, while the openhole interval length extended an additional 50  mm {{down into the}} specimen. The openhole interval was originally intended to have a length of 100  mm starting from the cased depth to an overall bottom-hole depth of 200  mm, but a tough inclusion or layer existed within the granite sample, which prevented drilling further. Hydraulic fracture orientation predictions could not be made prior to stimulation because the sample was unstressed. Although the overall fracturing direction was not estimated prior to testing, {{it was predicted that}} the hydraulic fracture would produce a larger and more extensive network in the upper half of the sample because of the possible hard inclusion or layer encountered during the openhole interval drilling procedure.|$|R
5|$|The launch was {{the first}} to use a newly {{developed}} high-performance motor for the solid rocket boosters, which gave approximately 7% greater thrust, and the second-last to use the original standard-mass <b>steel</b> <b>casings</b> for the boosters.

50|$|The Splitterring (German {{compound}} combining Splitter (splinter or fragment) and Ring (ring)) was a fragmentation sleeve for the M24 and M43 stick grenades, {{developed by}} the Heer in 1942.

40|$|In a {{hydrocarbon}} well, cement {{fills the}} annular gap between two <b>steel</b> <b>casings</b> or between a <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> and rock formation, forming a sheath that isolates fluids in different zones of the well. For a well {{as long as}} several kilometers, the cement sheath covers a large area and inevitably contains small cracks. The cement sheath fails when a small crack grows and tunnels through {{the length of the}} well. We calculate the energy release rate at a steady-state tunneling front {{as a function of the}} width of the tunnel. So long as the maximum energy release rate is below the fracture energy of the cement, tunnels of any width will not form. This failsafe condition requires no measurement of small cracks, but depends on material properties and loading conditions. We further show that the crit-ical load for tunneling reduces significantly if the cement/casing and cement/formation interfaces slide. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4031649...|$|R
