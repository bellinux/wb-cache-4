5000|$|The Hunmin Jeong-eum {{credits the}} 古篆字 [...] "Gu Seal Script" [...] {{as being the}} source King Sejong or his ministers used to create hangul. This has {{traditionally}} been interpreted as the Old Seal Script, and has confused philologists because hangul bears no functional similarity to the Chinese seal scripts. However, 古 gǔ {{had more than one}} meaning: besides meaning old, it could be used to refer to the Mongols (蒙古 Měng-gǔ). Records from Sejong's day played with this ambiguity, joking that [...] "no one is more gu than the Meng-gu". That is, Gu Seal Script may have been a veiled reference to the Mongol Seal Script, or Phagspa alphabet. (Seal script is a style of writing, used for name seals <b>and</b> <b>official</b> <b>stamps.</b> Phagspa had a seal script variant modeled after the appearance of the Chinese seal script of its day. In this guise it was called the 蒙古篆字 Mongol Seal Script, with only the initial character distinguishing it from the 古篆字 credited by the Hunmin Jeong-eum as the source of hangul.) There were many Phagspa manuscripts in the Korean palace library, and several of Sejong's ministers knew the script well.|$|R
50|$|A {{notarial}} act (or notarial instrument or notarial writing) is any written narration {{of facts}} (recitals) {{drawn up by}} a notary public or civil-law notary authenticated by his <b>signature</b> <b>and</b> <b>official</b> seal <b>and</b> detailing a procedure which has been transacted by or before him in his official capacity. A notarial act is the only lawful means of proving those facts {{of which it is}} the recognized record, whereas on other matters it is usually inadmissible, because, being beyond the powers entrusted to the notary by law, it is non-official. In most common-law countries, multiple-page acts are bound together using a sewn or knotted ribbon (referred to as silk), the ends of which are secured by a wafer impressed with the notary's seal. This is called annexing or annexure.|$|R

2500|$|In Germany, paintball is {{restricted}} to players over 18 years of age. Paintball markers are classified as weapons {{that do not require}} a license or permit; they are legal to buy and use, but restricted to adults. Markers are limited to a kinetic energy of 7.5 J. Tampering with the marker to increase muzzle velocity above 214 fps can lead to confiscation/destruction of the marker and a fine.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess consumer preference and willingness to pay for sheep meat quality and safety attributes in Addis Ababa city. Two hundred (200) households were selected using multi-stage sampling procedure. Rapid market appraisal and key-informant discussions were held to select five most relevant sheep meat quality and safety attributes i. e. hygiene, freshness, <b>official</b> <b>stamp,</b> fat content, <b>and</b> price. These were derived using an orthogonal fractional factorial design to create profile scenarios. A cross-tabulation analysis was also employed between socio-demographic features and consumption frequency. The results of cross tabulation analysis indicated that sociodemographic variables such as age, education level, occupation, and household income have a significant effect on consumer preference. However, demographic variables such as gender, religion, ethnicity, and marital status do not. The data from conjoint experiment were estimated using rank-ordered logit model in which the ranking of product profile were determined by the five quality and safety attributes. Relative importance and willingness to pay for were estimated from the coefficient of rank-ordered logit result. All parameters from rank-ordered logit model were significantly different from zero with the expected signs, suggesting that the quality and safety attributes selected significantly influence consumer choice behavior at 1 % significance level. The result of the analysis indicates that hygiene is highly valued by all consumers regardless of income strata, as indicated by part-worth utility, relative importance, and willingness to pay and the least preferred attribute is fat content. Hygiene contributes up to 37. 41 % of overall utility, followed by freshness (18. 48 %), price (16. 02 %), <b>official</b> <b>stamp</b> (14. 29 %), and fat content (13. 80 %). From these results, the most preferred combination of sheep meat quality and safety attributes was clean, fresh, price of 42 ETB, <b>official</b> <b>stamp</b> present, <b>and</b> low fat content. Result from this study indicates that respondents from high income households were more concerned about hygiene and fat content than medium and low income households. Conversely, respondents from the low income households were more concerned about price, freshness <b>and</b> <b>official</b> <b>stamp</b> than their medium and higher income counterparts. It was also found that consumers have a particular preference for hygiene as the most dominant attribute influencing purchasing decision. A large percent of consumers were willing to pay a premium for hygiene; where individual consumers were willing to pay a premium of 23. 35 ETB for sheep meat of better and improved cleanliness. Freshness was ranked second with a WTP premium of 11. 53 ETB for freshness attribute in sheep meat. On average, consumers WTP for <b>official</b> <b>stamp,</b> <b>and</b> fat content were 8. 92 ETB and 8. 61 ETB respectively. Thus, from the WTP result, hygiene, freshness, <b>official</b> <b>stamp,</b> <b>and</b> fat content were ranked from most to least valued attributes, thus preferred in terms of how their levels influencing consumer preference. The derived WTPs across income strata were also similar with those obtained using the whole sample. This finding would have a positive implication for forming product differentiation strategies within the animal source food policy in general and the sheep meat industry in particular. Specifically, it could be a source of information for producers in the sheep meat industry about consumer preference and willingness to pay for the selected quality and safety attributes...|$|R
5000|$|Gregory Simon and Peter Alagona had a {{different}} argument, saying in a 2009 article {{that there should be}} a move beyond Leave No Trace. They argued that this ethic [...] "disguises much about human relationships with non-human nature" [...] because it makes it seem that parks and wilderness areas are [...] "pristine nature" [...] which in their view, [...] "erases their human histories, and prevents people from understanding how these landscapeshave developed over time through complex human-environment interactions". In the place of this ethic, they say {{that there should be a}} new environmental ethic [...] "that transforms the critical scholarship of social science into a critical practice of wilderness recreation, addresses the global economic system...and reinvents wilderness recreation as a more collaborative, participatory, productive, democratic, and radical form of political action". In the article they also write about how certain corporations in the outdoor recreation industry and magazines like National Geographic support Leave No Trace (LNT), but that in stores for outdoor recreation products like REI, [...] "the LNT logo becomes both a corporate brand <b>and</b> an <b>official</b> <b>stamp</b> of approval".|$|R
