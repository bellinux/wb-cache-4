5|$|In 1969 the <b>special-purpose</b> Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod, {{based on}} the de Havilland Comet airliner, was {{introduced}} into RAF service and Coastal Command duties were passed on to general squadrons. The Nimrod was a replacement for the Shackleton and it began to do so on 2 October 1969. However, less than eight weeks later, Coastal Command was disbanded and ceased to exist on 27 November 1969, when it was subsumed into RAF Strike Command.|$|E
5|$|Some {{more modern}} steels include tool steels, which are alloyed with {{large amounts of}} {{tungsten}} and cobalt or other elements to maximize solution hardening. This also allows the use of precipitation hardening and improves the alloy's temperature resistance. Tool steel is generally used in axes, drills, and other devices that need a sharp, long-lasting cutting edge. Other <b>special-purpose</b> alloys include weathering steels such as Cor-ten, which weather by acquiring a stable, rusted surface, and so can be used un-painted. Maraging steel is alloyed with nickel and other elements, but unlike most steel contains little carbon (0.01%). This creates a very strong but still malleable steel.|$|E
5|$|Special state service flags {{are used}} by state-employed civil <b>special-purpose</b> ships while on duty. These flags all follow the same basic design; a white flag with a {{horizontal}} stripe whose width is 1/5 of the flag's width. In the middle, each flag is emblazoned with the national coat of arms superimposed on a golden or yellow anchor whose height is 3/5 of the flag's width. The middle stripe is broken {{in the middle and}} does not touch the anchor or the arms. The type of special service performed by the ship is indicated by the color of the middle stripe.|$|E
5|$|The other <b>special-purpose</b> card, the MTR Airport Staff Octopus, is {{available}} for the staff of Hong Kong International Airport and AsiaWorld-Expo, a convention centre close to the airport, for commuting at a reduced fare between the airport and MTR stations via the Airport Express. Staff who apply for the card may use it for a discount of up to 64 percent for Airport Express single journey fares. The MTR Airport Staff Octopus {{is available}} upon application via the company for which that a staff member works.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{electrical}} flaws, the Metroliners proved mechanically sound. Amtrak ordered over 600 non-powered Amfleet cars, {{based on}} the Metroliner design and also manufactured by Budd, in the mid-1970s. Beginning in 1987, Amtrak converted 23 former Metroliners for use as cab control cars on corridor trains. Fourteen more cars were used with minimal modifications - six as cab cars and 8 as trailer coaches. Most former Metroliners were scrapped between 2003 and 2011. However, some cab cars remain in use on Keystone Service and Shuttle trains. Three former Metroliners have also been converted to technology testing or track measurement cars, and one more is used by Amtrak as a <b>special-purpose</b> business car. One original Metroliner is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|The {{geologic}} map of Georgia (a state within the United States) is a <b>special-purpose</b> map made to show geological features. Rock units or geologic strata are shown by colors or symbols to indicate {{where they are}} exposed at the surface. Structural features such as faults and shear zones are also shown. Since the first national geological map, in 1809, {{there have been numerous}} maps which included the geology of Georgia. The first Georgia specific {{geologic map}} was created in 1825. The most recent state-produced geologic map of Georgia, by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources is 1:500,000 scale, and was created in 1976 by the department's Georgia Geological Survey. It was generated from a base map produced by the United States Geological Survey. The state geologist and Director of the Geological Survey of Georgia was Sam M. Pickering, Jr. Since 1976, several geological maps of Georgia, featuring the state's five distinct geologic regions, have been produced by the federal government.|$|E
5|$|The <b>special-purpose</b> card, Airport Express Tourist Octopus, was {{introduced}} by Octopus Cards Limited to target tourists in Hong Kong. Two versions of this card are offered, a HK$220 card with a free single ride on the Airport Express, the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) train line that runs between the Hong Kong International Airport and the urban areas of Hong Kong, and a HK$300 card with two free single rides included. The airport journeys are valid for 180 days from the date of purchase. Both versions allow three days of unlimited rides on the MTR and include a HK$50 refundable deposit. Usable value on these cards may be added if necessary. These tourist Octopus cards may be used only by tourists staying in Hong Kong for 14 or fewer days; users {{may be required to}} produce a passport showing their arrival date in Hong Kong. Airport Express Tourist Octopus is available for purchase at all MTR stations.|$|E
5|$|Anton is a <b>special-purpose</b> {{supercomputer}} {{built for}} molecular dynamics simulations. In October 2011, Anton and Folding@home {{were the two}} most powerful molecular dynamics systems. Anton is unique {{in its ability to}} produce single ultra-long computationally costly molecular trajectories, such as one in 2010 which reached the millisecond range. These long trajectories may be especially helpful for some types of biochemical problems. However, Anton does not use Markov state models for analysis. In 2011, the Pande lab constructed a MSM from two 100-µs Anton simulations and found alternative folding pathways that were not visible through Anton's traditional analysis. They concluded that there was little difference between MSMs constructed from a limited number of long trajectories or one assembled from many shorter trajectories. In June 2011 Folding@home began added sampling of an Anton simulation in an effort to better determine how its methods compare to Anton's. However, unlike Folding@home's shorter trajectories, which are more amenable to distributed computing and other parallelizing methods, longer trajectories do not require adaptive sampling to sufficiently sample the protein's phase space. Due to this, it is possible that a combination of Anton's and Folding@home's simulation methods would provide a more thorough sampling of this space.|$|E
5|$|The Image Computer never sold well. Inadequate sales {{threatened}} {{to put the}} company out of business as financial losses grew. Jobs invested more and more money in exchange for an increased stake in the company, reducing the proportion of management and employee ownership until eventually, his total investment of $50million gave him control of the entire company. In 1989, Lasseter's growing animation department, originally composed of just four people (Lasseter, Bill Reeves, Eben Ostby, and Sam Leffler), {{was turned into a}} division that produced computer-animated commercials for outside companies. In April 1990, Pixar sold its hardware division, including all proprietary hardware technology and imaging software, to Vicom Systems, and transferred 18 of Pixar's approximately 100 employees. That same year, Pixar moved from San Rafael to Richmond, California to Burbank, California. Pixar released some of its software tools on the open market for Macintosh and Windows systems. RenderMan was one of the leading 3D packages of the early 1990s, and Typestry was a <b>special-purpose</b> 3D text renderer that competed with RayDream addDepth.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{planning}} for BART {{began with the}} setting up in 1957 of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, a county-based <b>special-purpose</b> district body that governs the BART system. The district initially began with five members, {{all of which were}} projected to receive BART lines: Alameda County, Contra Costa County, the City and County of San Francisco, San Mateo County, and Marin County. Though invited to participate, Santa Clara County supervisors elected not to join BART in 1957, preferring instead to concentrate on building expressways. In 1962 San Mateo County supervisors voted to leave BART, saying their voters would be paying taxes to carry mainly Santa Clara County residents. The district-wide tax base was weakened by San Mateo's departure, forcing Marin County to withdraw a month later. Despite the fact that Marin had originally voted in favor of BART participation at the 88% level, its marginal tax base could not adequately absorb its share of BART's projected cost. Another important factor in Marin's withdrawal was an engineering controversy over the feasibility of running trains on the lower deck of the Golden Gate Bridge, an extension forecast as late as three decades after the rest of the BART system. The withdrawals of Marin and San Mateo resulted in a downsizing of the original system plans, which would have had lines as far south as Palo Alto and northward past San Rafael. Voters in the three remaining participating counties approved the truncated system, with termini in Fremont, Richmond, Concord, and Daly City, in 1962.|$|E

25|$|A {{general-purpose}} amplifier {{with typical}} low-impedance output is used. Its output {{is connected to}} the primary of an external step-up transformer. <b>Special-purpose</b> transformers can tailor the system design to the project's target power levels. Multiple amplifiers can be combined together via transformers to yield higher voltage and higher current capacity lines. For instance, three 70-volt amplifiers have been used to make a 210-volt line by connecting them to a <b>special-purpose</b> external output transformer that has three primaries and a single secondary.|$|E

25|$|A <b>special-purpose</b> {{factoring}} algorithm's {{running time}} {{depends on the}} properties of the number to be factored or on one of its unknown factors: size, special form, etc. Exactly what the running time depends on varies between algorithms.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-four {{years after}} the birth of Spetsnaz, the first counter-terrorist unit was {{established}} by the Chairman of the KGB gen. Yuri Andropov. From the late 1970s through the 1980s, a number of <b>special-purpose</b> units were created in the KGB and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD).|$|E
25|$|Wholesale {{transactions}} (bids and offers) {{in electricity}} are typically cleared and settled {{by the market}} operator or a <b>special-purpose</b> independent entity charged exclusively with that function. Market operators do not clear trades but often require knowledge of the trade {{in order to maintain}} generation and load balance.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} a {{specialist}} networking lab that was equipped with more than 20 enterprise level network switches and routers, including wireless and VoIP devices. There was a dedicated security and software forensics laboratory. There were also many <b>special-purpose</b> facilities for embedded system development and robotics.|$|E
25|$|Many {{oscilloscopes}} {{have different}} plug-in modules for different purposes, e.g.,high-sensitivity amplifiers of relatively narrow bandwidth, differential amplifiers, amplifiers with {{four or more}} channels, sampling plugins for repetitive signals of very high frequency, and <b>special-purpose</b> plugins, including audio/ultrasonic spectrum analyzers, and stable-offset-voltage direct-coupled channels with relatively high gain.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there were}} {{numerous}} attempts to introduce NAPLPS services in North America, none of these was successful and eventually shut down. A number of <b>special-purpose</b> systems lived on for some time, similar to Prestel's lingering death, but the widespread rollout of internet access in the 1990s ended these efforts.|$|E
25|$|Switzerland {{banned the}} sale of all light bulbs of the Energy Efficiency Class F and G, which affects a few types of {{incandescent}} light bulbs. Most normal light bulbs are of Energy Efficiency Class E, and the Swiss regulation has exceptions for various kinds of <b>special-purpose</b> and decorative bulbs.|$|E
25|$|Oscilloscopes {{are used}} in the sciences, medicine, engineering, {{automotive}} and the telecommunications industry. General-purpose instruments are used for maintenance of electronic equipment and laboratory work. <b>Special-purpose</b> oscilloscopes may be used for such purposes as analyzing an automotive ignition system or to display the waveform of the heartbeat as an electrocardiogram.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} types of {{specialist}} police departments with varying jurisdictions. Most of these serve <b>special-purpose</b> districts and are known as special district police. In some states, they serve {{as little more than}} security police, but in states such as California, special district forces are composed of fully sworn peace officers with statewide authority.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} subclass of <b>special-purpose</b> factoring algorithms is the Category 1 or First Category algorithms, whose {{running time}} {{depends on the}} size of smallest prime factor. Given an integer of unknown form, these methods are usually applied before general-purpose methods to remove small factors. For example, trial division is a Category 1 algorithm.|$|E
25|$|Speech mode {{hypothesis}} {{is the idea}} that the perception of speech requires the use of specialized mental processing. The speech mode {{hypothesis is}} a branch off of Fodor's modularity theory (see modularity of mind). It utilizes a vertical processing mechanism where limited stimuli are processed by <b>special-purpose</b> areas of the brain that are stimuli specific.|$|E
25|$|The {{administrative}} {{divisions of}} Illinois are counties, townships, precincts, cities, towns, villages, and <b>special-purpose</b> districts. The basic subdivision of Illinois are the 102 counties. 85 Of the 102 counties are in turn divided into townships and precincts. Municipal governments are the cities, villages, and incorporated towns. Some localities possess home rule, which {{allows them to}} govern themselves to a certain extent.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>special-purpose</b> {{optical fiber}} is {{constructed}} with a non-cylindrical core and/or cladding layer, usually with an elliptical or rectangular cross-section. These include polarization-maintaining fiber and fiber designed to suppress {{whispering gallery mode}} propagation. Polarization-maintaining fiber is a unique type of fiber that is commonly used in fiber optic sensors due to its ability to maintain the polarization of the light inserted into it.|$|E
25|$|Taxation in the United States is {{a complex}} system which may involve payment to at least four {{different}} levels of government and many methods of taxation. Taxes are levied by the federal government, by the state governments, and often by local governments, which may include counties, municipalities, township, school districts, and other <b>special-purpose</b> districts, which include fire, utility, and transit districts.|$|E
25|$|The Center for Computational Relativity and Gravitation {{was founded}} in 2007. The CCRG {{comprises}} faculty and postdoctoral research associates working {{in the areas of}} general relativity, gravitational waves, and galactic dynamics.
