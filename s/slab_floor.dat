5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s the central vault {{ceiling of the}} main {{sanctuary}} cracked, {{and had to be}} repaired. At that time the pulpit was also rebuilt, so that the rabbi and cantor had separate pulpits. Underneath the sanctuary ran an underground stream which would regularly overflow, leading to flooding problems. The flooding was fixed in the 1950s with the installation of check valves, and a concrete <b>slab</b> <b>floor</b> was installed. Though the intent was to provide usable space in the basement, it was rarely used.|$|E
5|$|There {{are small}} {{enclosed}} chambers {{to either side}} of the centre chapel. The chapel of St Padarn is on the left, with an imitation pointed vault and slate <b>slab</b> <b>floor.</b> In the entrance to the chapel there is a window on the left side depicting scenes from the manuscript Life of Padarn. The single-light window with various figures, scenes and motifs is by Elizabeth Edmundson, and dates from 1988. It includes Teilo, Padarn and Dewi (David) at the top, a healing by St Samson, Maelgwn, Arthur and Caradog, two kings of Ireland on horseback and a figure with the Virgin and Child. The figures are mostly modelled on figures from the Book of St Chad. In the chapel itself, which has a low slate altar stone and seat, is a porcelain relief sculpture by Gillian Still showing a story from the Life, the ordeal by boiling water. The chapel is lit only by two small windows (one with red glass, the other green) into the central chapel. Neither the altar stone in the larger room nor that in the chapel of St Padarn have been consecrated so neither are strictly speaking altars, and neither can be used for a Eucharistic service.|$|E

Using the equivalent flexural rigidity for the double layered <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> consisting of two different elastic moduli, analytical solutions expressed in Fourier series by thin plate theory and by elementary beam theory can be easily applied to the composite <b>floor</b> <b>slabs.</b> As a result of this analytical investigation, elastic deflection and stress resultants of the composite <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> are discussed in this paper.

500|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century there was a {{conscious}} attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords. Enclosures began to displace the runrig system and free pasture. New farm buildings, often based on designs in patterns books, replaced the fermtoun, and regional diversity was replaced with a standardisation of building forms. Smaller farms retained the linear outline of the longhouse, with dwelling house, barn and byre in a row, but in larger farms a three- or four-sided layout became common, separating the dwelling house from barns and servants quarters. Hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland were forcibly moved from the farms and small holdings their families had occupied for hundreds of years. Many small settlements were dismantled. Of those that remained many were now crofters: poor families living on [...] "crofts"—very small rented farms with indefinite tenure used to raise various crops and animals, with kelping, fishing, spinning of linen and military service as important sources of revenue. Many lived in blackhouses with double thickness walls about [...] high, made of local stone and packed with rubble and earth and thatched with reeds. They were unfaced inside and were usually warmed by a peat fire on a <b>slab</b> <b>floor,</b> the smoke from which gave them their name. Others were forced either to the new purpose-built villages built by the landowners such as John Cockburn at Ormiston and Archibald Grant's Monymusk, to the new industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh, northern England, or to Canada or the United States.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide {{recommendations}} to designers, and to propose a simple method for designers to model the structural behaviour of hollowcore concrete <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> in fire. The proposed finite-element model incorporates a grillage system using beam elements to capture the thermal expansion of the precast units in both directions, with the topping concrete over several precast units modelled by shell elements. The research reported herein compares the proposed model with various fire test results of hollowcore concrete slabs. The simulation outcomes show good agreement with the experimental results. Several hollowcore concrete <b>slab</b> <b>flooring</b> systems tested previously at the University of Canterbury for seismic purposes were simulated using this modelling scheme. Various supporting schemes have been considered, and the results show that different arrangements of axial and rotational restraint at the supports can significantly influence the fire performance of the concrete <b>slab</b> <b>floors.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} of building structures made of reinforced concrete is their considerable weight. One of the trends {{to decrease the}} weight of concrete structures, including <b>floor</b> <b>slabs,</b> is the arrangement of voids in the cross-sectional building structures.
