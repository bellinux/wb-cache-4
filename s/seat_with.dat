5|$|He {{served as}} Minister until the 10 May 1941 {{election}} when the Mair Government {{was defeated in}} a landslide defeat, losing 20 seats. Despite this, Treatt retained his <b>seat</b> <b>with</b> a significant margin increase of 67.68%. With the very poor results of the federal United Australia Party under Billy Hughes at the 1943 Federal election, the UAP disintegrated. A large number of former UAP members, including Treatt, then formed the Democratic Party in New South Wales, led by Alexander Mair, while others moved into the Commonwealth Party and the Liberal Democratic Party. The Democratic Party then merged with the Commonwealth Party in January 1944. Mair resigned in 1944 {{to be replaced by}} Reginald Weaver, who then led the hopelessly divided conservative forces to defeat at the 27 May 1944 election, losing another three seats. Treatt retained his <b>seat</b> <b>with</b> 50.50%.|$|E

5|$|After {{a review}} of {{parliamentary}} representation in Greater Manchester, the Boundary Commission recommended Astley {{should be part of}} the Leigh constituency at the United Kingdom general election, 2010. At the 2010 General Election Andy Burnham retained the Leigh <b>seat</b> <b>with</b> 24,295 votes and a majority of 15,011, representing 51.3% of the vote.

Jo Platt, representing Labour, was elected in 2017 with 26,347 votes which was 56.2% of the total votes cast.|$|E
5|$|At the May 1925 election, Bruxner {{retained}} his <b>seat</b> <b>with</b> {{an increased}} margin of 41%, while the Nationalist/Progressive Government lost office to Jack Lang and the Labor Party. After the election, the Progressive party renamed themselves the Country Party, reflecting the electoral {{base of the}} party. Bruxner resigned the leadership {{at the end of}} 1925, citing the difficulty in balancing the needs of his family with the commitments of his political career, and was succeeded by Ernest Buttenshaw.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 he {{was adopted}} as the Conservative {{parliamentary}} candidate for Aberdeenshire West. This was a Liberal held seat although the sitting member was retiring {{at the next}} election.

5|$|Rice {{sought a}} second term in the {{legislature}} in the 2008 statewide elections, facing Republican Dave Kerber. Holding office in a <b>seat</b> <b>with</b> voter registration numbers favoring Republicans, the race {{was expected to be}} strongly contested. As of early October, Rice had spent nearly $120,000 on his re-election campaign, the second-highest level of spending among all Colorado House of Representatives candidates. Rice's re-election bid was endorsed by the Denver Post, and he ultimately won with 54 percent of the popular vote.|$|E
5|$|The rest of Bruxner's {{parliamentary}} {{career was}} {{to be on the}} opposition benches, due largely to the disintegration of the larger opposition party, the UAP, after the 1943 Federal election. A large number of former UAP members then formed the Democratic Party in New South Wales, led by Mair, who continued as Opposition Leader. Mair resigned as Democratic Party Leader on 10 February 1944, to be replaced by former Assembly Speaker Reginald Weaver. At the 1944 election, Bruxner's stable leadership ensured that the Country Party retained all ten of its seats in the Legislative Assembly. Bruxner retained his <b>seat</b> <b>with</b> 67.73%.|$|E

5|$|The third Leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party, Treatt {{became the}} first to contest an {{election}}. At the election on 3 May 1947, Treatt's Liberals and Michael Bruxner's Country Party failed to defeat the Labor Government, now under new Premier James McGirr, despite an overall swing of 4.5% and a gain of seven seats. Treatt retained his <b>seat</b> <b>with</b> an increased 69.75%.|$|E
5|$|Auckland's {{population}} growth, {{as evidenced}} in the 2001 census, {{led to the}} formation for the 2002 general election of a new electorate called Helensville, which covered the north-western corner of the Auckland urban area. Key beat long-serving National MP Brian Neeson (whose own Waitakere seat had moved on paper to being a Labour seat through the boundary changes) for the National Party Helensville selection. At the 2002 election Key won the <b>seat</b> <b>with</b> a majority of 1,705, ahead of Labour's Gary Russell, with Neeson, now standing as an independent, coming third. Key won re-election with ease at the 2005 election garnering 63% of votes cast in Helensville, and increased his majority again in 2008, gaining 73% of the electorate vote.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in March 2013, the {{majority}} of the airline's fleet will be retrofitted with new Business and Economy Class seats. The seats are nearly identical to the new Regional Business Class and new Long-haul Economy Class products offered by parent company Cathay Pacific. Seats in both classes will be fitted with StudioKA (a rebranded version of the StudioCX inflight entertainment system on board Cathay Pacific aircraft), which features a 12.1-inch (Business Class) or 9-inch (Economy Class) touchscreen display, Audio/Video on Demand (AVOD), support for iOS devices, and a USB port for connectivity to other devices. In-seat power outlets will be available to all passengers. The new Business Class will feature a 21-inch wide recliner <b>seat</b> <b>with</b> 45 inches (narrowbody aircraft) or 47 inches (widebody aircraft) of pitch, while the new Economy Class will be 18.1 inches wide with 30 inches (narrowbody aircraft) or 32 inches (widebody aircraft) of pitch.

5|$|Cahill had won {{popular support}} as a {{vigorous}} and impressive minister who had resolved problems with New South Wales' electricity supply {{and in his}} first 10 months as premier had reinvigorated the party. He brought order to the government's chaotic public works program. In addition, he attacked the increasingly unpopular federal Coalition government of Robert Menzies. All this, combined with Bruxner and Treatt constantly clashing over policy and candidate issues, contributed to the Liberal-Country Coalition again being defeated at the 14 February 1953 election. This amounted to a total loss of ten seats, three being Country Party seats, and a swing against them of 7.2%. Bruxner retained his <b>seat</b> <b>with</b> 60.15%.|$|E
5|$|Christchurch is {{represented}} by a single parliamentary constituency in the House of Commons. The seat was created in 1983 from parts of the Christchurch and Lymington, North Dorset and New Forest constituencies. It had been held by Robert Adley (Conservative) since its creation {{until his death in}} 1993. At the by-election Diana Maddock (Liberal Democrat) was elected in one of the largest ever swings (35.4%) against the sitting party. The seat was retaken by Conservative candidate Christopher Chope in 1997 and retained in 2001 and 2005. In the 2010 general election, Chope retained his <b>seat</b> <b>with</b> a considerable majority of 15,410 and 56.4% of the vote, making Christchurch one of the safest Conservative constituencies in the country. The Liberal Democrats won 25.3% of the vote, Labour 9.8% and the Independence Party 8.5%. Christchurch is part of the South West England constituency for elections to the European Parliament.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite the}} efforts of Mair and Bruxner, the {{controversy}} surrounding Stevens' departure and a resurgent Labor Party, now led by the moderate William McKell, ensured that the popularity of the government never recovered. At the campaign for the 10 May 1941 election, the government performed poorly, finding it difficult to distinguish themselves from the past and proposing policies but only promising action after the war. McKell's Labor Party did the opposite, leaving war matters to the federal government and promising current reforms. At the election, the Labor Party polled more than half the vote while Bruxner's Country Party lost nine seats and Mair's UAP lost twenty seats. Bruxner retained his <b>seat</b> <b>with</b> 56%. Bruxner would never again hold ministerial office and the conservative political forces would not take government again until Robert Askin and Charles Cutler won the 1965 election.|$|E

A large number of former UAP members then formed the Democratic Party in New South Wales, led by Mair, who became Opposition Leader, while others moved into the Commonwealth Party and the Liberal Democratic Party. The Democratic Party then merged with the Commonwealth Party in January 1944. With the {{conservative}} vote split in half, Mair had little chance, and resigned as Democratic Party Leader on 10 February 1944, {{to be replaced by}} Weaver, who then became Party Leader and Leader of the Opposition. Weaver then led the party to the 1944 election where it won 19% of the vote and 12 of the 90 seats in the Legislative Assembly. Weaver himself retained his <b>seat</b> <b>with</b> 56.90%.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, {{a formal}} opinion by the Attorney General {{concluded}} that resignation from Congress does not free a member {{to be appointed}} to civil office because the Clause speaks to the term for which a member was elected, and that term still exists, even if a member resigns. Therefore, as in the Paterson matter nine decades earlier, Iowa Governor Samuel J. Kirkwood, who had resigned a Senate <b>seat</b> <b>with</b> a term that did not expire until March 1883, was ineligible for appointment {{to the position of}} United States Tariff Commissioner. In 1896, the Comptroller of the Treasury determined, after the fact, that former Senator Matthew Ransom's appointment as Minister to Mexico was invalid, as that office's salary had been increased during Ransom's term; the belated discovery precluded Ransom from drawing a salary.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Clement Attlee, the Labour Prime Minister, {{called a}} general election. Dunglass {{was invited to}} stand once again as Unionist {{candidate}} for Lanark. Having been disgusted at personal attacks during the 1945 campaign by Tom Steele, his Labour opponent, Dunglass did not scruple to remind the voters of Lanark that Steele had warmly thanked the Communist Party and its members for helping him take the seat from the Unionists. By 1950, with the Cold War at its height, Steele's association with the communists was a crucial electoral liability. Dunglass regained the <b>seat</b> <b>with</b> {{one of the smallest}} majorities in any British constituency: 19,890 to Labour's 19,205. Labour narrowly won the general election, with a majority of 5.|$|E
