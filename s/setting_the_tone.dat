25|$|In October 2002, {{the team}} elected to extend Chaney's {{contract}} for another year. Rather than rebuilding, the Knicks opted to add veterans to the roster including Antonio McDyess {{who had been}} dealing with knee problems in the preceding years. Furthermore, the Knicks were criticized by many analysts as multiple players on the roster were overpaid {{in light of their}} poor performances, causing salary cap problems that would persist until Donnie Walsh took over as team president. McDyess injured his knee during the team's third preseason game and was subjected to further operations in April 2003 after a CT scan revealed the injured knee necessitated he undergo bone-graft surgery. The Knicks managed only seven wins in their first twenty games, <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> {{for the rest of the}} season, which they completed with a 37–45 record; it was their second consecutive season without a playoff appearance.|$|E

500|$|The Japanese {{air base}} {{that would serve}} as the {{launching}} point was called Mizutani at Chitose locally, and Sapporo Air Base by the Americans. Today it is the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force Camp Higashi-Chitose. It was built at {{the southern part of}} Japan's northern island Hokkaidō, near the city of Sapporo, as the base for long-range flights to attack the U.S.—one-way suicide trips made by four-engine bombers—a function that it never served. The three B-29s landed safely, and LeMay stepped from his aircraft to be greeted by approximately 30 Japanese soldiers and the base commander, who saluted for some time before realizing that LeMay had no intention of returning the salute. With that treatment <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> for U.S.–Japan relations in the area, the airmen made certain to wear side arms as they walked around downtown Sapporo on the evenings of September 16 and 17.

She played a 45-minute set, wearing a seashell bra and thong. According to David Lipke of Women's Wear Daily, Gaga lip-synced the song.|$|E
500|$|After being criticised for omitting any {{coverage}} of a Madison Square Garden benefit in April 1983, The New York Times increased its {{coverage of}} AIDS, <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> for an increase across print media. One of the most high-profile early pieces introducing AIDS to the heterosexual community was the cover article of the August 8, 1983, edition of Newsweek, showing Campbell and his lover Bobby Hilliard and headlined [...] "EPIDEMIC: The Mysterious and Deadly Disease Called AIDS May Be the Public Health Threat of the Century. How Did it Start? Can it Be Stopped?"

500|$|Author and {{illustrator}} Ernest Thompson Seton {{published his}} first book, the bestselling Wild Animals I Have Known, in 1898. The first entry {{in a new}} genre of realistic wild-animal stories, Seton's {{collection of short stories}} quickly {{became one of the most}} popular books of its day. Although he had considered himself [...] "a naturalist of the usual type, trying merely to accumulate specimens and facts" [...] during his early career, he later began to write factual material [...] "in the form of romantic stories—fiction in the form of presentation, but solid in fact in their basis and their message." [...] The first story in the collection, [...] "Lobo, The King of Currumpaw" [...] was based upon Seton's experience hunting wolves in the Southwest. It became a classic, <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> for his future works that would similarly depict animals—especially predators who were often demonized in literature—as compassionate, individualistic beings. Seton was reportedly denounced by readers for having killed Lobo, only to write about the experience; however, as biographer Brian Morris stated, the readers' sympathies [...] "are directed, as Seton meant them to be, toward the wild animal, rather than against the teller of the tale".|$|E
