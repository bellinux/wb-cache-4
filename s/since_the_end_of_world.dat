5|$|Lithium {{production}} has greatly increased <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>World</b> War II. The metal {{is separated from}} other elements in igneous minerals. The metal is produced through electrolysis from a mixture of fused 55% lithium chloride and 45% potassium chloride at about 450°C.|$|E
5|$|Centralized {{artillery}} {{command and}} control. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>World</b> War I, German divisions had had their artillery spread out amongst their component regiments, {{which made it}} difficult to bring the maximum weight of fire to bear on any one point. Model reorganized his artillery into special battalions under the direct control of the divisional and corps commanders.|$|E
5|$|Singapore was colonized by the British in the 19th century, {{during which}} society was ruled {{according}} to English law.

5|$|The {{government}} {{in exile in}} London, unrecognized <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>World</b> War II, ridiculed by the communists, to many Poles was of great symbolic importance.

5|$|A third {{method is}} for {{authorities}} simply to talk down {{the value of}} their currency by hinting at future action to discourage speculators from betting on a future rise, though sometimes this has little discernible effect. Finally, a central bank can effect a devaluation by lowering its base rate of interest; however this sometimes has limited effect, and, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>World</b> War II, most central banks have set their base rate according to the needs of their domestic economy.|$|E
5|$|On May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court {{handed down}} its ruling in Brown v.

Although agitation for an end to racial segregation in schools (and society at large) had been building in the United States <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>World</b> War II, Brown sparked the modern American civil rights movement.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the terms}} of the Treaty of Versailles, which had been in place <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>World</b> War I, stated that Germany was not allowed to {{maintain}} an air force. After the 1926 signing of the Kellogg–Briand Pact, police aircraft were permitted. Göring was appointed Air Traffic Minister in May 1933. Germany began to accumulate aircraft in violation of the Treaty, and in 1935 the existence of the Luftwaffe was formally acknowledged, with Göring as Reich Aviation Minister.|$|E
5|$|Palestine {{had been}} a British Mandate <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>World</b> War I. Under {{the terms of the}} mandate, Great Britain was {{responsible}} for the government and security of the country. It had long been a stated British aim to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine and between 1922 and 1939 over 250,000 Jewish immigrants had arrived in the country. However, Arab resistance and World War II prompted the British to curtail immigration. The time also saw the rise of the Jewish Resistance Movement, which eventually came into conflict with the British authorities.|$|E
5|$|The Korean Peninsula {{had been}} divided between {{occupation}} {{forces of the}} United States and the Soviet Union <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>World</b> War II along the 38th Parallel. Each government sought to prop up a government on its side of the occupation border, and as the Cold War began, tensions rose between the two Koreas. These culminated in open warfare with the North's invasion of the South on June 25. During this time, the United Nations backed South Korea and considered it the only lawful government.|$|E

5|$|The goal of American {{armed forces}} was to {{reinforce}} {{the remnants of the}} South Korean Army (ROK) in fighting back the North Korean invasion (but only in the southeastern part of South Korea, around the major seaport of Pusan) to prevent the complete collapse of the South Korean Army and of the South Korean Government. However, the American armed forces in the Orient had been decreasing steadily <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>World</b> War II, by mid-1950, there were no American troops in South Korea, and the American force in Japan had dwindled drastically.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, much of the {{attention}} was placed on the weather forecast and the prospects of rain. In their 12 tour matches leading up to the Tests, Australia had been almost completely untroubled by the opposition except in the two matches against Yorkshire and Hampshire on rain-affected pitches. In these two matches they came close to defeat after heavy batting collapses before recovering to victory. It was thus thought that the toss could be of great importance, especially if the team batting first had accumulated a substantial total by the time rain came. The match was the first Ashes Test to be played on English soil <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>World</b> War II.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} run, the Navy {{decided to move}} the Chance Vought factory from Stratford, Connecticut to a much larger facility in Dallas, Texas which had been vacant <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>World</b> War II; this badly disrupted {{the production}} of the Pirate. The airframes were built in Stratford and trucked to Dallas where government-furnished equipment, such as the engines and afterburners, were installed. The completed aircraft were then taxied around the new plant's airfield, but the runway was deemed too short to handle jets. The aircraft had to be disassembled and trucked to an abandoned airfield at Ardmore, Oklahoma with a runway long enough for acceptance testing.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{invasion}} of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) by its northern neighbor, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the subsequent outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950, the United Nations decided to enter the conflict on behalf of South Korea. The United States—a member of the UN—subsequently committed ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of fighting back the North Korean invasion and to prevent South Korea from collapsing. However, U.S. forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>World</b> War II, five years earlier, and at the time the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division, headquartered in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invasion}} of the South Korea by North Korea on June 25, 1950, the UN voted to use force to defend South Korea. The United States, a member of the UN, simultaneously committed ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of pushing back the North Korean invasion and preventing South Korea from collapsing. But US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>World</b> War II, five years earlier, and at the time the closest force was the 24th Infantry Division, headquartered in Japan. The division was understrength, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Nevertheless, the 24th was ordered to South Korea.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe said Japan {{wanted to}} shed the passiveness it has {{maintained}} <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>World</b> War II and take {{more responsibility for}} regional security. Abe said Japan wanted to {{play a key role}} and offered neighboring countries Japan's support. In recent years, they have been engaged in international peacekeeping operations including the UN peacekeeping. Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society. New military guidelines, announced in December 2010, will direct the JSDF away from its Cold War focus on the former Soviet Union to a focus on China, especially regarding the territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council {{voted to}} send {{assistance}} to the collapsing country and U.S. President Harry S. Truman ordered ground troops to the country. U.S. forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>World</b> War II, five years earlier, and Shadrick's division was the closest to the warzone. Under the command of Major General William F. Dean, the division was understrength {{and most of its}} equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. In spite of these deficiencies the division was ordered into South Korea, tasked with taking the initial shock of the North Korean advances until the rest of the Eighth United States Army could arrive and establish a defense.|$|E
5|$|Modern western vegetarianism {{was founded}} in the United Kingdom in 1847 with the world's first Vegetarian Society. It has {{increased}} markedly <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>World</b> War II, when there were around 100,000 vegetarians in the country. By 2003 there were between 3 and 4 million vegetarians in the UK, {{one of the highest}} percentages in the Western world, while around 7 million people claim to eat no red meat. By 2015, 11 of 22 restaurant chains studied by the Vegan Society had at least one vegan main course on their menu, though only 6 of these explicitly labelled them as vegan dishes. Top-end vegetarian restaurants remain relatively few, though they are increasing rapidly: there were some 20 in Britain in 2007, rising to 30 in 2010.|$|E
