Jackson followed with three punches to Silva's head on the ground, two of which occurred after referee Yves Lavigne attempted to halt the contest. Wanderlei remained on the canvas for <b>several</b> <b>moments,</b> but appeared to be OK {{as he left the}} cage under his own power.|$|E
5|$|While at the station, Max overhears his new partner, Valerie Winterson, {{talking on}} the phone about Mona. Suddenly, the station is {{attacked}} by the Cleaners, who are looking for Mona. Mona breaks out of her cell, and after fighting off the Cleaners, Max and Mona begin hunting down the people responsible for the attack. Their search leads them to a construction site, where he and Mona defend themselves against the Cleaners. After their foes leave, Winterson arrives and holds Mona at gunpoint. Mona claims that Winterson is there to kill her, while Winterson claims that she is simply trying to arrest a fleeing fugitive. After <b>several</b> <b>moments</b> of consideration, Max fatally shoots Winterson, allowing Mona to escape. Before she dies, Winterson shoots Max, hospitalizing him.|$|E

The building consists of <b>several</b> pre-Northridge <b>moment</b> resisting frames and gravity frames. The structure’s seismic performance level was determined based on story drift criteria. Linear Dynamic Procedure (LDP) with seven Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) time history records suitable for this site was used. The results demonstrate that this building is seismically deficient. The building is successfully retrofitted with diagonally positioned fluid viscous dampers on <b>several</b> <b>moment</b> frames. The study included numerical simulation with SAP 2000 where acceptable dampers were selected based on their force and stroke to match commercially available dampers...|$|R
5|$|Green-head ant {{males are}} {{produced}} irregularly {{throughout the year}} and are low-flying ants. Recorded nuptial flights begin between September to November at temperatures of 20–25°C (68–77°F), when a number of males begin to emerge from their nest. Sometimes, however, the males may return to their nest after briefly appearing outside. The green-head ant is a gamergate species, which means that males can successfully mate with the workers. These workers remain outside their nest with their head and thorax appressed and gaster elevated into the air. Observation has shown the workers first attacking the males when the two first encounter each other, followed by the male mounting the worker by grasping it in the cervical region with its mandibles, successfully attaching itself. Both ants usually rest when they mate, but sometimes the workers may groom themselves or move about <b>several</b> <b>moments</b> after, thereby disengaging with the male. On a few occasions, workers have been seen to move as soon as copulation begins and drag the male, eventually dislodging it. Copulation usually occurs at 8 to 9 in the morning, with pairs lasting for 30 seconds to almost one minute. Most pairs mate once, but others may copulate with each other twice. In some cases, males will successfully mate with two workers, and some pairs may return to their nest while mating.|$|E

Meanwhile, Essex had finished pursuing the small 8-gun New Zealander and captured her without difficulty. Captain Porter then assisted in chasing down Seringapatam.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevator}} rises for a {{few seconds}} before coming to its first stop. The doors open to reveal a long, dimly lit hotel corridor, with overgrown plants and doors to guest rooms, with morning newspapers and room-service trays outside, along its length. There is a single window {{at the opposite end of}} the corridor. A violent thunderstorm is raging and lightning flashes outside the window. The five missing passengers from 1939 appear for <b>several</b> <b>moments,</b> turning to face the elevator and beckoning the guests to join them. Then they disappear in a burst of electricity. The corridor fades away, but the window remains until it appears to be floating in a dark field of stars. The window morphs into the window from the Season 5 opening sequence, and breaks.|$|E

25|$|He was {{recognized}} as an inspiring speaker. In August 1924, he {{was transferred to the}} Saint Bonaventure convent in Detroit, where he worked until 1945. During this time, he mostly served as the simple porter (or receptionist and doorkeeper). Each Wednesday afternoon, he conducted well-attended services for the sick, and through these services, he became known for his great compassion and the amazing results of his consultations with visitors. People considered him instrumental in cures and other blessings. He loved to kneel before the Eucharist in the quiet of the night; Father Benedict Groeschel once recalled visiting the convent on a warm night and being unable to sleep. Around 3:00am, Groeschel took a walk and arrived at the chapel where he put on two lights and saw Casey kneeling on the top step of the altar. Groeschel observed him for <b>several</b> <b>moments</b> and noted that Casey didn't move – Groeschel simply flicked the lights off to leave Casey to his prayer.|$|E

Powell, however, listed Mr. T wrestling as his least favorite moment of the pay-per-view.

500|$|Campbell had {{to sleep}} wearing his make-up. Because of several scenes that {{required}} to be shot in both {{the day and the}} night, it was considered easiest to have Campbell sleep all night wearing his make-up, since removing it was too complicated. When Campbell eventually had the effect removed, he was alarmed to notice that his face had actually [...] "changed shape" [...] because of how long the make-up had been applied, though it returned to normal after an extended amount of time. This serves as one of <b>several</b> <b>moments</b> where the film-makers had to be creative to make the film considering the low budget. Other examples include blacking out the windows to make scenes darker and shooting all night long to make the filming schedule. Raimi had to get increasingly inventive during production, often coming up with [...] "bizarre" [...] ideas while shooting scenes.
