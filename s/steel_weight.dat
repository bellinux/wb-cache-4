50|$|These are {{the robust}} 'big rigs', {{generally}} used with steel cylinders. Most popular with cold-water sidemount divers in the USA and Europe. Most {{often seen in}} Florida cave systems.

5000|$|The hull is a {{longitudinally}} {{framed structure}} {{and has been}} designed to minimize <b>steel</b> <b>weight.</b> The construction involved initial production of partially outfitted steel modules which were made into sub-assemblies and then integrated into the ship.

In contrast to many modern mine warfare vessels, which often have hulls made of non-magnetic glass-reinforced plastic or similar material, the Kingston class have conventional steel hulls.

50|$|In {{the last}} few years, M4A1 {{carbines}} have been refit or received straight from factory with barrels with a thicker profile under the handguard. This is {{for a variety of}} reasons such as heat dissipation during full-auto, and accuracy as a byproduct of barrel weight. These heavier barrel weapons are also fitted with a heavier buffer known as the H2. Out of three sliding weights inside the buffer, the H2 possesses two tungsten weights and one <b>steel</b> <b>weight,</b> versus the standard H buffer, which uses one tungsten weight and two steel weights. These weapons, known by Colt as the Model 921HB (for Heavy Barrel), have also been designated M4A1, and as far as the government is concerned the M4A1 represents both the 921 and 921HB.|$|E

5000|$|Short and stubby icebreakers are {{generally}} built using transverse framing {{in which the}} shell plating is stiffened with frames placed about 400 to 1000 mm apart as opposed to longitudinal framing used in longer ships. Near the waterline, the frames running in vertical direction distribute the local ice loads on the shell plating to longitudinal girders called stringers, which in turn are supported by web frames and bulkheads that carry the global hull loads. While the shell plating, which is {{in direct contact with}} the ice, can be up to 50 mm thick in older polar icebreakers, the use of high strength steel with yield strength up to [...] in modern icebreakers results in the same structural strength with smaller material thicknesses and lower <b>steel</b> <b>weight.</b> Regardless of the strength, the steel used in the hull structures of an icebreaker must be capable of resisting brittle fracture in low ambient temperatures and high loading conditions, both of which are typical for operations in ice-filled waters.|$|E
50|$|Although double-hulled tankers {{reduce the}} {{likelihood}} of ships grazing rocks and creating holes in the hull, a double hull does not protect against major, high-energy collisions or groundings which cause the majority of oil pollution, despite this being the reason that the double hull was mandated by United States legislation. Double-hulled tankers, if poorly designed, constructed, maintained and operated can be as problematic, if not more problematic than their single-hulled counterparts. Double-hulled tankers have a more complex design and structure than their single-hulled counterparts, which means that they require more maintenance and care in operating, which if not subject to responsible monitoring and policing, may cause problems. Double hulls often result in the weight of the hull increasing by at least 20%, and because the <b>steel</b> <b>weight</b> of doubled-hulled tanks should not be greater than that of single-hulled ships, the individual hull walls are typically thinner and theoretically less resistant to wear. Double hulls by no means eliminate the possibility of the hulls breaking apart. Due to the air space between the hulls, there is also a potential problem with volatile gases seeping out through worn areas of the internal hull, increasing the risk of an explosion.|$|E
