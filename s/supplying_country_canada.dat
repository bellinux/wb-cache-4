50|$|Ground-source {{heat pumps}} always produce fewer {{greenhouse}} gases than air conditioners, oil furnaces, and electric heating, but natural gas furnaces may be competitive {{depending on the}} greenhouse gas intensity of the local electricity <b>supply.</b> In <b>countries</b> like <b>Canada</b> and Russia with low emitting electricity infrastructure, a residential heat pump may save 5 tons of carbon dioxide per year relative to an oil furnace, or {{about as much as}} taking an average passenger car off the road. But in cities like Beijing or Pittsburgh that are highly reliant on coal for electricity production, a heat pump may result in 1 or 2 tons more carbon dioxide emissions than a natural gas furnace. For areas not served by utility natural gas infrastructure, however, no better alternative exists.|$|R

To assure a stable supply of qualified foreign seafarers, this study aims to research and select a foreign seafarer <b>supply</b> <b>country</b> for Korean Flag vessels. Factors influencing the selection were identified, and these factors were assessed by Delphi, fuzzy, and fuzzy TOPSIS methods in order to make a selection from several countries. Via empirical analysis by the fuzzy method, the results show that the factor of “total crew costs” is the most significant, followed by “quality of seafarers’ education and training” and “supply ability for well-trained seafarers. ” “government support from supply countries” is the least weighted factor for decision makers. The alternative countries assessment by fuzzy TOPSIS method suggests that the Philippines should be chosen as the dedicated foreign seafarer <b>supply</b> <b>country</b> for Korean Flag vessels, given the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of these alternative foreign seafarer <b>supply</b> <b>countries.</b> Finally, some implications for continuous improvement of the seafarer <b>supply</b> <b>countries</b> are provided...|$|R
