40|$|This {{paper is}} the {{documentation}} for a numerical code for quantum transport called KNIT. The KNIT library implements a generalization {{of the well}} known recursive Green function technique for a large class of multi-terminal mesoscopic systems with arbitrary geometries, topology and dimension. The systems are described by tight-biding Hamiltonians (with arbitrary internal degree of freedom like <b>spin,</b> electron/hole <b>grading,</b> orbitals [...] .) and the calculation done within the non equilibrium Green function formalism (equivalent to the Landauer-Buttiker Scattering approach). KNIT can (and has) been applied to many different physical systems including quantum Hall effect, topological insulators, graphene ribbons, hybrid superconducting systems and ferromagnetic multilayers. KNIT main functionality is written in C++ and wrapped into Python, providing a simple and flexible interface for the user. Usual "input files" of numerical codes are replaced by small python scripts where the user builds the system and then computes whatever observable (conductance, noise, local density of states [...] .) is needed. KNIT code can be obtained freely at the following url: [URL] 69 pages. Download KNIT at: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|For {{integrable}} inhomogeneous supersymmetric <b>spin</b> chains (generalized <b>graded</b> magnets) constructed employing Y(gl(N|M)) -invariant R-matrices in finite-dimensional representations we {{introduce the}} master T-operator {{which is a}} sort of generating function for the family of commuting quantum transfer matrices. Any eigenvalue of the master T-operator is the tau-function of the classical mKP hierarchy. It is a polynomial in the spectral parameter which is identified with the 0 -th time of the hierarchy. This implies a remarkable relation between the quantum supersymmetric spin chains and classical many-body integrable systems of particles of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider type. As an outcome, we obtain a system of algebraic equations for the spectrum of the spin chain Hamiltonians. Comment: 44 pages, v 2 : minor correction...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{the demand}} of {{efficient}} quantum devices to engineer the energy transport, we analyze some inhomogeneous quantum spin systems, including the XXZ chains, with magnetization baths at the ends. Aimed at finding general properties, we study {{the effects of}} suitable transformations on the boundary-driven Lindblad master equation associated to the dynamics of the systems. For asymmetric models with target polarization at the edges or twisted XY boundary gradients, we show properties of the steady state which establish features of the energy current, irrespective of the system size and of the regime of transport. We show the ubiquitous occurrence of energy rectification and, more interestingly, of an unusual phenomenon: in the absence of external magnetic field, there is an one-way street for the energy current, i. e., the direction of the energy current does not change as we invert the magnetization baths at the boundaries. Given the extensiveness of the procedures, which essentially involve properties of the Lindblad master equation, our results certainly follow for other interactions and other boundary conditions. Moreover, our results indicate <b>graded</b> <b>spin</b> chains as genuine quantum rectifiers. Comment: 5 page...|$|R
40|$|A {{bioassay}} technique using isolated guinea-pig ileum {{was employed}} to compare the smooth muscle contractor activity of various dusts from mills in which the prevalence of byssinosis was known. The activity of dust from a mill <b>spinning</b> a coarse <b>grade</b> of cotton was several times greater than that in dust from a mill processing a fine grade of cotton. There was a similar order in the difference of the prevalence of byssinosis in these mills. However, the activities of fine cotton, flax, and jute dusts were very similar to each other, in spite of marked differences in the prevalence of byssinosis in these mills. For cotton dust, smooth muscle contractor activity was associated with all particle sizes, although {{the lowest level of}} activity was found in the largest sized fraction (less than 2 mm). Activity in the cotton dust extracts was not correlated with nitrogen, carbohydrate, or potassium content. However, about one-fifth of the activity of a cotton dust extract was associated with an insoluble particulate fraction. The possible chemical nature of the water-soluble contractor agent is discussed. It is concluded that, until the role of this agent in the pathogenesis of byssinosis has been established, the bioassay technique cannot be employed as a means of assessing the byssinogenic potential of cotton dust...|$|R
40|$|This is the {{published}} version. Preprint version and supporting data available at [URL] 2015 AIP Publishing LLC. The wave solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz equation (spin waves) {{are characterized by}} some of the most complex and peculiar dispersion relations among all waves. For example, the spin-wave ("magnonic") dispersion can range from the parabolic law (typical for a quantum-mechanical electron) at short wavelengths to the nonanalytical linear type (typical for light and acoustic phonons) at long wavelengths. Moreover, the long-wavelength magnonic dispersion has a gap and is inherently anisotropic, being naturally negative for a range of relative orientations between the effective field and the spin-wave wave vector. Nonuniformities in the effective field and magnetization configurations enable the guiding and steering of spin waves in a deliberate manner and therefore represent landscapes of graded refractive index (graded magnonic index). By analogy to the fields of graded-index photonics and transformation optics, the studies of <b>spin</b> waves in <b>graded</b> magnonic landscapes can be united under the umbrella of the graded-index magnonics theme and are reviewed here with focus on the challenges and opportunities ahead of this exciting research direction.

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the study of {{vibration}} and stability analyses of functionally <b>graded</b> <b>spinning</b> shaft system under thermal environment using three nodded beam element based on TBT. Temperature field {{is assumed to be}} a uniform distribution over the shaft surface and varied in radial direction only. Material properties are assumed to be temperature dependent and graded in radial direction according to power law gradation. In the present analysis, the mixture of Aluminum Oxide and Stainless Steel is considered as FG material where metal contain is decreasing towards the outer diameter of shaft. The FG shafts are modeled as a Timoshenko beam by mounting discrete isotropic rigid disks on it and supported by flexible bearings that are modeled with viscous dampers and springs. Based on FOSD beam theory with transverse shear deformation, rotary inertia, gyroscopic effect, strain and kinetic energy of shafts are derived by adopting three-dimensional constitutive relations of material. The derivation of governing equation of motion is obtained using Hamilton’s principle and solutions are obtained by three-node FE with four DOF per node. In this work the effects of both internal damping have also been incorporated in the finite element model. A complete code has been developed using MATLAB program and validated with the existing results available in literatures. The analysis of numerical results reveals that temperature field and power law gradient index have a significance role on the materials properties of FG shaft. Various results have also been obtained such as Campbell diagram, stability speed limit, damping ratio and time responses for FG shaft due unbalance masses and also compared with conventional steel shaft. It has been found that the responses of the FG spinning shaft are significantly influenced by radial thickness, power law gradient index and internal damping and temperature dependent material properties...|$|R
