The saturation current density Jo,pad due to <b>soldering</b> <b>pads</b> {{is found to}} be in the range of 26. 7 103 to 85. 4 103 fA/cm 2 for different conditions of the rear silicon surface. The recombination under <b>soldering</b> <b>pads</b> leads to a voltage drop of ΔVoc = 6. 7 mV for Al-BSF solar cells with 6. 2 % of the rear side being covered with <b>soldering</b> <b>pads</b> compared to a cell with full-area Al-BSF. Within a microstructural analysis of the interface between the silicon surface and the <b>soldering</b> <b>pads</b> it is found that Al-alloying from the Al share in the <b>soldering</b> <b>pad</b> paste only occurs insularly. Furthermore, Al-BSF cells with and without residual rear side emitter and varying area fraction of <b>soldering</b> <b>pads,</b> using a <b>soldering</b> <b>pad</b> paste with and without an Al-share, are investigated.

They first enter a pre-heat zone, where {{the temperature of}} the board and all the components is gradually, uniformly raised. The boards then enter a zone where the temperature is high enough to melt the solder particles in the solder paste, bonding the component leads to the pads on the circuit board. The surface tension of the molten solder helps keep the components in place, and if the <b>solder</b> <b>pad</b> geometries are correctly designed, surface tension automatically aligns the components on their pads.|$|E
5000|$|PCB pins are {{soldered}} {{directly to}} {{a printed circuit board}} and not to a wire. Traditionally through hole plated (THP) board style pins were used (print) but increasingly gull wing surface mount (SMD) connections are used, although the latter frequently exhibit <b>solder</b> <b>pad</b> contact problems when exposed to mechanical stress. These connectors are frequently mounted at a right angle to the PCB, allowing a cable to be plugged into the edge of the PCB assembly. While angled connectors traditionally occupied significant room on the PCB, flat SMD connector variants are produced by various manufacturers. Electrical/mechanical anchor points (often soldered) for the connector shell and locking screws are also provided, but significantly differ in their position between US and EU connector variants, so that the correct type must be used unless the PCB was designed to accept them both. The PCB connectors are available in variants with either inch or metric pitch of the soldered contacts. Tolerances are typically large enough to allow the mounting of the smaller connectors regardless of the pitch variant used, but this does not hold true for the larger connectors.|$|E

Next, in a move to reduce radio frequency interference when a joystick plugs into the motherboard's game I/O socket, filtering capacitors were added. While this made no difference to the average user, it had the negative effect of lowering the available bandwidth to the socket, which is often used by specialized devices for such purposes as measuring temperature, controlling a robotic device, or even simplistic networking for data transfer to another computer. In such cases the specialized devices were rendered useless on the Platinum IIe unless the user removed the capacitors from the board.|$|E

Mechanical fatigue tests have been conducted to confirm the theoretical analysis. The test results consistently demonstrated that the TDR reflection coefficient gradually decreased as the <b>solder</b> <b>pad</b> separated from the circuit board, whereas it increased during solder joint cracking. Traditional test methods based on electrical resistance monitoring cannot distinguish between failure mechanisms and do not detect degradation until an open circuit has been created.

40|$|AbstractThe {{majority}} of screen printed solar cells has silver pads {{at the rear}} side to enable soldering for the module manufacturing. The pads increase the recombination at the silicon/metal interface due {{to the absence of}} a back surface field (BSF) at the <b>solder</b> <b>pads.</b> This reduces the efficiency of full-area Al-BSF solar cells. For passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC), a large area fraction of the rear side is covered with the passivation layer. When using specially designed Ag pastes for the rear side of PERC cells, the passivation of this layer is maintained, and the rear recombination is reduced. A comparison of solar cells with and without <b>solder</b> <b>pads</b> confirms that there is no loss in solar cell performance, both cell types achieve an efficiency of 19. 6 %. We investigate the influence of <b>solder</b> <b>pads</b> to PERC solar cells by calculating the effective rear surface recombination. The calculations confirm that there is a loss in open circuit voltage of less than 2 mV due to the <b>solder</b> <b>pads.</b> A 54 -cell PERC PV module is manufactured. The cell-to-module loss reveals that the module process is still to be optimized.

Since the solder mask is applied on the whole PCB surface, consisting of epoxy base material {{as well as of}} copper, intimate contact to copper surfaces is given. With regard to the adhesion on solder masks in the PCB composite, this study focusses on photoimageable solder masks based on epoxy acrylate dual cure systems [1].|$|E

The first and second doping types are partially arranged {{adjacent to each other}} for forming a pn-junction. The contact structures are arranged at a metallization side of the semiconductor substrate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The solar cell comprises a semiconductor substrate (1) having a front side and a rear side, first (3 a) and second metallic contact structures, and first and second electroconductive connection structures, where the semiconductor substrate has a first doped region of a first doping type and a second doped region of a second doping type that is opposite to the first doping type. The first and second doping types are partially arranged adjacent to each other for forming a pn-junction. The contact structures are arranged at a metallization side of the semiconductor substrate and the metallization side is the front- and rear side of the solar cell. The first and second contact structures are electroconductively connected with the first and second doped regions respectively. The electroconductive connection structures are arranged at the metallization side of the solar cell. The contact structures are partially covered by an electrically non-conducting insulating layer, which is partially covered by the connection structures. The first and second connection structures are electroconductively connected with the first and second contact structures respectively. The insulating layer and the first and second connection structures are integral component of the solar cell, and exceed in their dimensions parallel to the metallization side not over the dimensions of the solar cell. The contact structures are completely covered with the insulating layer up to hole-like recesses and the connection structures directly adjoin to the assigned contact structures in the hole-like recesses for forming an electrically conducting connection. The connection structures have a cross-sectional surfaces counter-rotatingly increasing and decreasing parallel to the metallization side, so that the cross-sectional surface of the first connection structure outcoming from the first edge region of the solar cell linearly decreases to a second edge region of the solar cell that is opposite to the first edge region and the cross-sectional surface of the second connection structure outcoming from the first edge region linearly increases to the second edge region. The first edge region and the second edge region are formed for bringing a cell binder. One of the contact structures has a <b>solder</b> <b>pad</b> and is covered with the insulating layer such that the insulating layer has a recess {{in the area of the}} <b>solder</b> <b>pad,</b> so that the assigned connection structure directly adjoins to the <b>solder</b> <b>pad</b> to form the electrically conducting connection. The solar cell corresponds to a metal wrap through-solar cell in the basic construction of the structure. The substrate has a through-plating (7), which electroconductively connects the metallization side with the opposing side of the solar cell using a metallic through-connection. The first contact structure on the metallization side adjoins to the metallic through-connection for forming the electrically conducting connection. The first contact structure is covered with the insulating layer, so that the insulating layer has a recess in the area, at which the through-connection adjoins to the contact structure. The first contact structure and the through-connection are produced in a process step. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for manufacturing a solar cell. USE - Solar cell useful in a solar cell module (claimed).

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} {{have revealed that}} Pb-free solder joints may be fragile, prone to premature interfacial failure particularly under shock loading, as initially formed or tend to become so under moderate thermal aging. Depending on the <b>solder</b> <b>pad</b> surface finish, different mechanisms are clearly involved, {{but none of the}} commonly used surface finishes appear to be consistently immune to embrittlement processes. This is of obvious concern for products facing relatively high operating temperatures for protracted times and/or mechanical shock or strong vibrations in service. While fragility problems and the associated embrittlement mechanisms have long been known for both electroless and electrolytically deposited Ni/Au coatings, soldering to copper has been viewed as 'safer ' as far as robustness is concerned. However, recent observations suggest the existence of two or more embrittlement mechanisms in Pb-free solder joints on Cu pad structures, each leading to brittle interfacial fracture at the pad surfaces. With risks of embrittlement associated with all the commonly used solderable surface finishes, the electronics industry is currently confronting very difficult problems. The variability in their manifestation does, however, lend hope that some of these problems may be avoidable or controllable...|$|E

Understanding the fundamental mechanical performance of the DuPont 951 substrate material, including the effect of surface metallization in STS environments, is required to determine MC 4352 survivability.

After thermal aging for 250 hours, with a few exceptions, the predominant failure mode by the ball shear tests appeared to be the fracture at the interface between the Pd/Ag metallization and the PZT substrate.

The variety of surface mount device (SMD) terminations, <b>solder</b> <b>pad</b> shape and surface properties, soldering processes, and properties of solder pastes currently leads to ill-understood and ad hoc methods of specifying component terminations, joint geometry, and soldering parameters and to the consequent risk of reduced process yields for SMD-to-printed-circuit-board connections.
