40|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} technology {{provides a}} clear {{image of the}} future of quantitative microscopy “By the help of Microscopes, there is nothing so small as to escape our inquiry; hence there is a new visible World discovered to the understanding. ” Thus wrote Robert Hooke in his pioneering work Micrographia [1] published by the Royal Society in 1664. In this revolutionary book, Hooke described with excitement his discoveries using a <b>simple</b> <b>light</b> <b>microscope,</b> coining the word ‘cell ’ to define the microscopic structures he saw in cork and plant samples. In this issue of Journal of Biology [2], Claude Lechene and colleague...|$|E
40|$|Conjugates of {{antibody}} {{with the}} enzyme marker, peroxidase, are {{relatively easy to}} prepare and can be shown to have a sensitivity in the indirect test for antinuclear antibodies which is entirely comparable to that obtained with fluorescein labelled material. Clear cut results were obtained in tests for autoantibodies on tissue sections and for bound IgG in biopsies using an antihuman immunoglobulin conjugate. Antibodies to Treponema pallidum were also readily demonstrable. Only a <b>simple</b> <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> is required, slides can be read without fatigue and the morphology of the tissue section can be easily assessed. It is concluded that the peroxidase technique offers a useful alternative to immunofluorescence...|$|E
40|$|The sensitivities of Giemsa, immunofluorescence, and {{immunoperoxidase}} staining for {{the detection}} of Chlamydia psittaci inclusions in conjunctival scrapings and in irradiated McCoy cell monolayers were compared. Conjunctival specimens were obtained from a cat colony in which a trachoma-like disease, feline chlamydial keratoconjunctivitis, was endemic. The two immunochemical techniques were found to be of equal sensitivity and 50 % to 100 % more sensitive than Giemsa stain. Permanent preparations of immunoperoxidase stained material can be made and can be read using a <b>simple</b> <b>light</b> <b>microscope.</b> These features make the technique more useful than immunofluorescence staining, which gives temporary preparations that must be examined with a specialised fluorescence microscope...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of malarial pigment (haemozoin) due to Plasmodium infection {{is a common}} histopathological effect in mouse liver. Previous research showed that by using a polarized <b>light</b> <b>microscope,</b> researchers were better able to detect haemozoin in mouse liver histology section. Thus, {{the aim of this}} research was to compare the haemozoin area observed by a conventional vs. <b>simple</b> polarized <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> by using image processing analysis. A total of 40 images produced from both conventional <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> and <b>simple</b> polarized <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> were collected. All images were analyzed using ImageJ 1. 47 software to measure the haemozoin areas. Our results showed that non birefringent haemozoin and birefringent haemozoin area was significantly different. This was because when using conventional <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> the brown area that contained images of non birefringent haemozoin images also contained Kupffer cells which appeared as the same brown color as haemozoin. In contrast, haemozoin gave bright effect and can be easily differentiated with Kupffer cells in the birefringent haemozoin images. This study concluded that haemozoin detection in mouse liver histology using a <b>simple</b> polarized <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> was more accurate compared to that of conventional <b>light</b> <b>microscope...</b>|$|R
50|$|Critical {{illumination}} or Nelsonian illumination is {{a method}} of specimen illumination used for transmitted and reflected light (trans- and epi-illuminated) optical microscopy. Critical illumination focuses {{an image of a}} light source on to the specimen for bright illumination. Critical illumination generally has problems with evenness of illumination as an image of the illumination source (for example a halogen lamp filament) is visible in the resulting image. Köhler illumination has largely replaced critical illumination in modern scientific light microscopy although it requires additional optics which less expensive and <b>simpler</b> <b>light</b> <b>microscopes</b> may not have.|$|R
50|$|With no {{modification}} to the microscope, i.e. with a <b>simple</b> wide field <b>light</b> <b>microscope,</b> {{the quality}} of optical sectioning is governed by the same physics as the depth of field effect in photography. For a high numerical aperture lens, equivalent to a wide aperture, the depth of field is small (shallow focus) and gives good optical sectioning. High magnification objective lenses typically have higher numerical apertures (and so better optical sectioning) than low magnification objectives. Oil immersion objectives typically have even larger numerical apertures so improved optical sectioning.|$|R
40|$|THE AIMS OF THE PRESENT STUDY WERE TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF ADRIAMYCIN VS IDARUBICIN IN EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS IN RESPECT TO CARDIOTOXICITY AND TO SEE THE EFFECT IN SERUM LIPIDS AFTER ACCUMULATIVE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ABOVE ANTRACYCLINES. EIGHTY WISTAR RATS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS OF 40 RATS EACH. GROUP A RECEIVED ADRIAMYCIN (1 MG/KG) /WEEK AND GROUP B RECEIVED (0, 5 MG/KG) /WEEK. THE RATS WERE SACRIFICED FROM THE 3 RD TO THE 12 TH WEEK. AUTOPSY WAS PERFORMED AND THE HEART WAS EXAMINED HISTOPATHOLOGICALLY UNDER THE <b>SIMPLE</b> <b>LIGHT</b> <b>MICROSCOPE.</b> BLOOD SAMPLES WERE EXAMINED TO DETERMINE LIPID SERUM VALUES. CARDIOTOXICITY WAS GREATER IN GROUP A COMPARED TO GROUP B. THERE WAS AN INCREASE OF THE CHOLESTEROL AND TRIGLYCERIDE VALUES AFTER THE CONTINUOUS ADMINISTRATION OF ADRIAMYCIN WHICH WAS SIGNIFICANT. ...|$|E
40|$|The immunoperoxide (IP) {{technique}} can be {{used for}} the detection of immune deposits in various tissue pathologies. This article focusses on the standardization of the reagents anti IgG, anti IgA and anti C 3 C which are used to target these immune deposits. Lymph node tissue was used as substrate for standardization of anti IgG and anti IgM. For anti IgA, intestine was used while for anti C 3 C kidney tissue rapidly proliferating glomerulo nephritis - RPGN was utilized. Sensitivity of the technique was found to be high. Also the results on paraffin section were excellent and could be interpreted using <b>simple</b> <b>light</b> <b>microscope.</b> It is concluded that once standardization is achieved, IP {{can be used}} as an essential modality in the detection of immune deposits {{in a wide variety of}} immunologically mediated dermatologic disorders...|$|E
40|$|Examination of the urinary {{sediment}} is {{a simple}} and indispensable tool in the diagnostic approach to patients with asymptomatic haematuria. Various glomerular and nonglomerular diseases can cause haematuria. A well-trained expert can distinguish between these two forms of haematuria by examining the urinary sediment under a <b>simple</b> <b>light</b> <b>microscope.</b> In glomerular haematuria, dysmorphic erythrocytes and erythrocyte casts are found, whereas in nonglomerular haematuria the erythrocytes are monomorphic and erythrocyte casts are absent. However, few people have sufficient expertise in {{the examination of the}} urinary sediment, and consequently this investigation is performed far too seldom. A few years ago, a simple method of fixation of the urinary sediment became available. Fixed specimens can be stored at room temperature for at least two weeks, which enables the sending of a fixed specimen to an expert examiner by regular mail. In this way, the urinary sediment can more frequently be used as the initial investigation in the diagnostic route of patients with asymptomatic haematuria...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} if the ordinary <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> is a useful tool in the detection and identification of crystals in synovial fluid 63 fluids (13 with monosodium urate (MSU), 14 with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD), one with both types of crystal, and 35 without crystals) were examined blindly by two observers, first with an ordinary <b>light</b> <b>microscope,</b> then with a polarising <b>light</b> <b>microscope.</b> Tentative identification of the crystals by their shape was attempted. The sensitivity of the ordinary <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> {{for the detection of}} crystals was 96. 2 % and 100 %, with specificity of 100 % and 97. 1 % for observers 1 and 2, both with respect to the polarising <b>light</b> <b>microscope.</b> The concordance between observers for the ordinary <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> was chi = 0. 90 (0. 897, 0. 902) and for the polarising <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> chi = 0. 96 (0. 958, 0. 961). The specificity for identification of MSU and CPPD crystals by their shape with respect to the polarising <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> was 92. 3 % and 85. 7 % for observers 1 and 2. When a polarising <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> is not available examination of synovial fluid by an ordinary <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> may allow a provisional diagnosis; definitive identification of the crystals requires a polarising <b>light</b> <b>microscope...</b>|$|R
40|$|Malaria pigment is an {{intracellular}} {{inclusion body}} {{that appears in}} blood and tissue specimens on microscopic examination and can help in establishing the diagnosis of malaria. In <b>simple</b> <b>light</b> microscopy, {{it can be difficult}} to discern from cellular background and artifacts. It has long been known that if polarized light microscopy is used, malaria pigment can be much easier to distinguish. However, this technique is rarely used because of the need for a relatively costly polarization microscope. We describe a simple and economical technique to convert any standard <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> suitable for examination of malaria films into a polarization microscope...|$|R

40|$|Conjunctival {{impression}} cytology is an easier, {{cheaper and}} faster non-invasive technique {{used as an}} alternative of biopsy to get epithelial cells from ocular surface. With the help of <b>simple</b> <b>light</b> <b>microscope,</b> special filter paper and Periodic Acid Shief (PAS) or hematoxylin staining, epithelial cell information and goblet cell density can be determined easily. Moreover, ocular inflammatory markers, cytokinins, chemokinins, ocular mucin, HLA-DR, CE 23 and different gene expression can be investigated by applying different procedures such as immunoblotting reactions, polymerase chain reactions, immunocytochemistry or flow cytometry (Baudouin et al, 1997). In the previous issue of Nepalese Journal of Ophthalmology, Kumar et al described a study on impression cytology in computer users (Kumar et al, 2013). Authors concluded that the computer use {{of more than one}} year duration makes abnormal conjunctival cytology. In that study with sample size of 15 computer users, all the subjects who use computer 4 - 6 hours a day, had 3 rd or 4 th stage of cytology. In addition to giving important information about the eyes of computer users, this report has raised a number of questions to be answered scientifically. However, a study with such a small sample size may not be strong enough to generalize it...|$|E
