5|$|The 42nd Division {{entered the}} line in the quiet Lunéville sector in February 1918. On 26 February, MacArthur and Captain Thomas T. Handy {{accompanied}} a French trench raid in which MacArthur assisted in the capture of a number of German prisoners. The commander of the French VII Corps, Major General Georges de Bazelaire, decorated MacArthur with the Croix de guerre. Menoher recommended MacArthur for a Silver Star, which he later received. The Silver Star Medal was not instituted until 8 August 1932, but small Silver Citation Stars were authorized to be worn on the campaign ribbons of those cited in orders for gallantry, similar to the British mention in despatches. When the Silver Star Medal was instituted, it was retroactively awarded to those who had been awarded Silver Citation Stars. On 9 March, the 42nd Division launched three raids of its own on German trenches in the Salient du Feys. MacArthur accompanied a company of the 168th Infantry. This time, his leadership was rewarded with the Distinguished Service Cross. A few days later, MacArthur, who was strict about his men carrying their gas masks but often neglected to bring his own, was gassed. He recovered in time to show <b>Secretary</b> <b>Baker</b> around the area on 19 March.|$|E

50|$|The Conscription Act of 1917 {{was passed}} in June. Conscripts were court-martialed by the Army if they refused to wear uniforms, bear arms, perform basic duties, or submit to {{military}} authority. Convicted objectors were often given long sentences of 20 years in Fort Leavenworth. In 1918 <b>Secretary</b> <b>Baker</b> created the Board of Inquiry to question the conscientious objectors' sincerity.

50|$|However, unlike earlier American peace efforts, no new aid {{commitments}} would be used. This was both because President Bush and <b>Secretary</b> <b>Baker</b> felt the coalition victory and increased US prestige would itself induce a new Arab-Israeli dialogue, and because their diplomatic initiative focused on process and procedure {{rather than on}} agreements and concessions. From Washington's perspective, economic inducements would not be necessary, but these did enter the process because Israel injected them in May.

50|$|<b>Secretary</b> <b>Baker</b> made {{frequent}} shuttle {{trips to}} the region between March and October 1991 {{in an attempt to}} find a procedural formula acceptable to all sides. He did not have an easy time finding the right formula to convene the conference, particularly on the issue of Palestinian representation. In light of Shamir's pro-settlement policy, Palestinians and many Arab governments viewed the request for Israeli loan guarantees as a test of America's credibility as mediator. In addition to Arab opposition, the Bush administration had its own problems with the request, because there was residual ill-will following Israel's refusal to verify whether the previous (October 1990) $400 million loan guarantee was used for settlement expansion; the administration did not see populating settlements as a humanitarian issue.|$|E
5000|$|Although [...] "check-book diplomacy" [...] {{had been}} used in the past to move the peace process, as at the Camp David Accords, President Bush and <b>Secretary</b> <b>Baker</b> felt the {{coalition}} victory and increased U.S. prestige would itself induce a new Arab-Israeli dialogue, but also because their diplomatic initiative focused on process and procedure rather than on specific agreements and concessions. From Washington's perspective, economic inducements would not be necessary, but in May, these entered the process with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's request for $11 billion in U.S. loan guarantees, to help absorb immigrants on humanitarian grounds. This request however, added a new dimension to U.S. diplomacy and sparked a political showdown between Shamir's Likud government and the Bush administration.|$|E
5000|$|However, on debarkation at the {{designated}} port of St. Nazaire, {{a dispute with}} French authorities broke out, after the AEF placed the Maisons Tolérée off limits.

Pershing passed the proposal to Raymond Fosdick, who on giving it to <b>Secretary</b> <b>Baker</b> responded: [...] "For God's sake, Raymond, don't show this to the president or he'll stop the war." [...] The French later proposed a deal that targeted the Black American troops, {{most of whom were}} assigned to unloading freight in segregated stevedore battalions, again flatly turned down by US authorities.

50|$|In January 1918, {{the first}} {{elements}} of the AEF, part of the 1st Infantry Division, prepared to deploy into the line at Ansauville. MG Sibert was relieved by General John J. Pershing before the Division's deployment to the front. Pershing was dissatisfied with the Division's progress and elevated Brigadier General Robert Lee Bullard, a true line officer, to replace Sibert. Sibert returned to the United States in January 1918 where he became the commanding General of the Army Corps of Engineers Southeastern Department located at Charleston, South Carolina. Sibert {{was not alone in}} his relief, as <b>Secretary</b> <b>Baker</b> had approved Pershing's relief of a number of individuals. Pershing showed some measure of respect for Sibert, who was pushing 58 years old (a contributing factor to his relief), recognizing that the position Sibert was in, was not entirely of his own making.

50|$|The Congress {{reversed}} {{these changes}} {{in support of the}} bureaus and in the National Defense Act of 1916 reduced the size and functions of the general staff to few members before America entered World War I on April 6, 1917. President Woodrow Wilson supported Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, who opposed efforts to control the bureaus and war industry until competition for limited supplies almost paralyzed industry and transportation, especially in the North. Yielding to pressure from Congress and industry, <b>Secretary</b> <b>Baker</b> placed Benedict Crowell in charge of munitions and made Major General George W. Goethals acting quartermaster general and General Peyton C. March chief of staff. Assisted by industrial advisers, they reorganized the supply system of the army and practically wiped out the bureaus as quasi-independent agencies. General March reorganized the general staff along similar lines and gave it direct authority over departmental operations. After the war, the Congress again granted the bureaus their former independence.|$|E

5000|$|After {{his company}} was sent to France in 1918, he saw action in the Vosges Mountains, Argonne Sector, and the Metz front. [...] "Neither can I individualize {{respecting}} the magnificent valor of {{the men of the}} company led by Captain Jones in this engagement, which <b>Secretary</b> <b>Baker</b> himself praised. When the awful bombardment died away, just as the gray streaks of early dawn pierced the night's blackness, which was made grayer by a thick heavy fog, the Captain ordered a charge 'over the top' with fixed bayonets; through the treacherous fog and into no-man-knew-what or seemed to care. The first wave, or detachment, went over with a cheer---a triumphant cheer---and the second wave followed their comrades with a dash. It may, perhaps, be best to let these boys and officers tell with their own lips of the terrific, murderous shell, shrapnel, gas, and machine-gun fire which baptized them, only to make them the more hardened and intrepid warriors; of how they contended every inch; fought with marvelous valor, never for an instant faltering. Trench after trench of the enemy was entered and conquered; dugout after dugout was successfully grenaded and made safe for the boys to follow; wires were cut and communicating trenches explored; machine-gun nests were raided and silenced, and still the boys fought their way on. Of course, as a natural sequence to such a daring raid, there were casualties, but the black soldiers, heroes as they were, never flinched at death, and the wounded were too proud of their achievements even to murmur because of the pain they endured. Captain Jones and his men took over a mile of land and trenches which for four years had been held by the Germans. The newspapers have given due and proper credit to the Americans for this daring raid, but the world has not been informed that it was the colored soldiers of America, under Captain J. Wormley Jones, a former Washington, D. C.,. policeman, who made the charge that was as daring, and more successful, than the Tennyson-embalmed charge of 'The Light Brigade.' [...] " ...|$|E
