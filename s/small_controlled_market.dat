40|$|The {{article is}} aimed at generalizing the {{theoretical}} provisions on <b>controlling</b> of <b>marketing</b> in enterprise: to clarify the place of <b>controlling</b> of <b>marketing</b> within the management system, constituents, goals, tasks, and functions. The <b>controlling</b> of <b>marketing</b> was considered in terms of concepts such as management of enterprise, management of marketing, operative management of <b>marketing,</b> <b>controlling,</b> strategic and operational <b>controlling</b> of <b>marketing,</b> and operative management of marketing costs. The constituents and tools of <b>controlling</b> of <b>marketing</b> at the strategic and the operational levels have been defined. The definition of operative <b>controlling</b> of <b>marketing</b> has been revised, which emphasizes managerial decision-making about marketing costs, taking account of current situation and optimality of such costs as to purposes of enterprise. A systematic approach to studying this issue provides a holistic view of <b>controlling</b> of <b>marketing</b> within the enterprise management system. A study on the theoretical aspects of <b>controlling</b> of <b>marketing</b> as a modern management concept {{will make it possible}} to approach the issue of decision-making on marketing activity in a holistic manner...|$|R

40|$|This article {{reports a}} {{comparative}} study of six in-house and eight independent industrial R&D organisations. These organisations are analysed in terms of three types of <b>control</b> strategy - <b>market</b> <b>control,</b> hierarchical control and professional control. The paper suggests that the professional control strategy, emergent after World War Two, is now being increasingly challenged by <b>market</b> <b>control</b> strategies. R&D organisations under or adopting <b>market</b> <b>control</b> are shown to enjoy marked productivity advantages. The distinctive managerial practices of <b>market</b> <b>controlled</b> R&D are analysed.

40|$|Instead of {{emphasize}} the "primacy of planning" in management process <b>marketing</b> <b>control</b> {{should be viewed}} as an activity that counterbalances marketing planning and strategy, and not as a "post hoc" adjunct to the planning function. Rather, it is a separate marketing function, which by continuously checking on the validity of plans, provides time and flexibility to an organization. Therefore, in this view, <b>marketing</b> planning and <b>control</b> are counterbalances processes which are performed simultaneously. The essence of feedback control is a measurement of the actual and desired states after action has been taken, and a subsequent correction of activities. In feedforward control the activities are corrected by predicting whether current activities would lead to desired states. The single most important reason why feedforward control is different from feedback control is that its use of information is prognostic. While feedback control tries to solve problems that have occurred, feedforward control tries to discover problems waiting to occur. It is also important to distinguish between financial non-financial and multiple control. Financial <b>control</b> of <b>marketing</b> activities involves <b>control</b> of sales revenue, profitability and return on marketing investment (ROMI). Non-financial <b>control</b> of <b>marketing</b> activities consists of <b>control</b> <b>market</b> share, customer satisfaction, customer loyalty, brand equity and customer equity. Key components of multiple <b>control</b> <b>marketing</b> activities are <b>control</b> of efficiency, effectiveness and marketing audit. Marketing performance measures have moved in three consistent directions over the years: from financial to non-financial output measures, from output to input measures and from undimensional to multidimensional measures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Previous {{work has}} shown {{that it could be}} prof-itable on some <b>control</b> <b>markets</b> to use Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) as control power resources. This concept, where battery driven {{vehicles}} such as PHEVs provide ancil-lary service to the grid is commonly referred to as Vehicle to Grid (V 2 G). The idea is to sell the capacity and energy of the parked PHEVs on the <b>control</b> <b>market.</b> Due to the fact that cars on average are parked 92 % of the day, the avail-ability of this capacity could be very high, even though it will be highly dependent on commuting patterns in peak hours. Further, as each PHEV has a very small capacity from a grid perspective, it is necessary to implement an aggregating con-trol system, managing a large number of vehicles. This paper presents a Monte Carlo simulation model where technical is-sues such as the reliability in communication for a large fleet of PHEVs is included. The communication in the simula-tion model is based on data from Automated Meter Reading (AMR) systems, which share important charachteristics with V 2 G communications. Moreover, the simulation is based on available data on the distributions of commuting departure times and travel distances, as well as average driving power consumption, PHEV battery capacities and the market con-straints of the secondary <b>control</b> <b>market</b> in Germany...|$|R
