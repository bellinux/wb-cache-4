2500|$|Methylisothiazolinone {{and other}} isothiazolinone-derived {{biocides}} {{are used for}} controlling microbial growth in water-containing solutions. [...] Two {{of the most widely}} used isothiazolinone biocides are 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (chloromethylisothiazolinone or CMIT) and 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (methylisothiazolinone or MIT), which are the active ingredients in a 3:1 mixture (CMIT:MIT) sold commercially as Kathon. Kathon is supplied to manufacturers as a concentrated <b>stock</b> <b>solution</b> containing from 10-15% of CMIT/MIT. For applications the recommended use level is from 6 ppm to 75 ppm active isothiazolones. Biocidal applications range from industrial water storage tanks to cooling units, in processes as varied as mining, paper manufacturing, metalworking fluids and energy production.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{testing a}} sample, the Spectronic 20 is {{calibrated}} using a blank solution, {{which is the}} pure solvent that {{is used in the}} experimental sample. [...] It is typically water or an organic solvent. [...] In this calibration, the transmittance is set at 100% using the calibration knob of the instrument (the amplifier control knob in the figure at right). The instrument can also optionally be calibrated with a <b>stock</b> <b>solution</b> of a sample at a concentration known to have an absorbance of 2 or else vendor supplied standards, using the light absorption knob in the diagram shown at right. After calibration, the user places a 1/2 inch test tube or cuvette containing the sample solution to be measured into the sample compartment. Calibration is repeated each time the wavelength is changed. It or a standard reference sample is generally used to periodically check for drift. To measure wavelengths above 650 nm, the bottom of the instrument is opened, and a red filter and a red-sensitive photocell is installed.|$|E
50|$|Webster's reagent <b>stock</b> <b>solution</b> {{is made by}} saturating {{absolute}} {{ethyl alcohol}} with pellets of sodium hydroxide. The <b>stock</b> <b>solution</b> is then diluted with a 9:1 ratio of absolute ethyl alcohol.|$|E

30|$|All the {{chemicals}} used were of AR grade. <b>Stock</b> <b>solutions</b> (1, 000  mg L− 1) of Cr(VI), Ni(II) and Cu(II) ions were prepared by dissolving potassium dichromate (K 2 Cr 2 O 7), nickel nitrate hexahydrate and copper sulphate (CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O), respectively, in deionised water.

50|$|The pH of the 10x <b>stock</b> <b>solution</b> of PBS is ~6.8, {{but when}} diluted {{with water to}} 1x PBS it should change to 7.4.

50|$|Metal-replacement toning {{with gold}} alone {{results in a}} blue-black tone. It is often {{combined}} with a sepia toner to produce a more attractive orange-red tone. The archival Gold Protective Solution (GP-1) formula uses a 1% gold chloride <b>stock</b> <b>solution</b> with sodium or potassium thiocyanate. It is sometimes used to split tone photographs previously toned in selenium for artistic purposes.|$|E
50|$|In chemistry, a <b>stock</b> <b>solution</b> is a {{large volume}} of a common reagent, such as {{hydrochloric}} acid or sodium hydroxide, at a standardized concentration. This term is commonly used in analytical chemistry for procedures such as titrations, where {{it is important that}} exact concentrations of solutions are used. Stock solutions do not necessarily come in concentrations of simple numbers; for example a solution could be 0.10082 M HCl.|$|E
30|$|Standard <b>stock</b> <b>{{solutions}}</b> of GLM (1  mg/mL) {{were prepared}}. Standard solutions of GLM (0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 0.9, 1.2, 1.4, and 2  μg/mL) were prepared by diluting the standard <b>stock</b> <b>solutions</b> with mobile phase.

The LOD and LOQ for GLM were found to be 0.38 and 1.17  μg/mL, respectively.|$|R
40|$|For {{quantitative}} susceptibility tests, <b>stock</b> <b>solutions</b> of nitrofurantoin {{are often}} prepared in dimethylformamide. Since 1. 0 or 2. 0 ml of the solvent will inhibit microbial growth, currently recommended procedures for antimicrobic dilution tests should be modified by adding only 0. 1 or 0. 2 ml of <b>stock</b> drug <b>solutions</b> to the agar or broth medium...|$|R
3000|$|... [16]. A gamma counter (Wallac 1480 Wizard® 3 ", Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland) {{was used}} to measure the {{activity}} in <b>stock</b> <b>solutions</b> and syringes before and after injection.|$|R
50|$|Flow-through. A {{flow-through}} test exposes the organism to the toxicant with a {{flow into the}} test chambers and then out of the test chambers. The once-through flow can either be intermittent or continuous. A <b>stock</b> <b>solution</b> of the correct concentrations of contaminant must be previously prepared. Metering pumps or diluters will control the flow and {{the volume of the}} test solution, and the proper proportions of water and contaminant will be mixed.|$|E
50|$|Starch always {{leaves the}} printed cloth {{somewhat}} harsh in feeling (unless modified carboxymethylated starches are used), but very dark colours can be obtained. Gum Senegal, gum arabic or modified guar gum thickening yield clearer and more even tints than does starch, suitable for lighter colours but less suited for very dark colours. (The gums apparently prevent the colours from combining fully with the fibers.) A printing <b>stock</b> <b>solution</b> {{is mostly a}} combination of modified starch and gum stock solutions.|$|E
50|$|Manley's recipe {{has become}} a {{standard}} {{and even if the}} requirement is for a stronger solution, this is often specified as '3x Manley strength' or '4x Manley strength'. His original recipe was one ounce of thymol crystals dissolved in five fluid ounces of surgical spirit to make the <b>stock</b> <b>solution.</b> Then half a fluid ounce of this mixture was added to 1 Cwt (112 lbs) of sugar, which he dissolved in 7 imperial gallons (8.75 US Gal.) of water for direct use as winter feed.|$|E
