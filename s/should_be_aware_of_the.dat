5|$|Routine {{screening}} of asymptomatic {{people is not}} indicated, since the disease is highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer. A cervical screening test, such as a Pap smear, is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially {{in the early stages}} of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. Cervical stenosis, the narrowing of the cervical opening, is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus (pyometra or hematometra).|$|E

Most archaeological dates are approximate.|$|E

25|$|The American Eskimo is a {{hardy breed}} {{with an average}} life span of 12–15 years. This breed tends to become {{overweight}} easily, so proper diet and exercise is needed to maintain an overall well being. Health testing should be performed by all responsible breeders and anyone purchasing a puppy <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genetic problems which {{have been found in}} some individuals of the breed, such as PRA (Progressive Retinal Atrophy), luxating patella, and hip dysplasia). None of these problems are common and the breed is generally very healthy. In addition to the rarer problems mentioned, the breed can have a tendency towards allergies and most commonly, tear-staining. This breed also is known in some cases to have dental issues.|$|E

2500|$|A {{short report}} {{indicated}} the Spitfire was 20mph (32km/h) faster from 0 to 5,000ft (0 to 1,525 m) and 15,000ft to 20,000ft (4,573 to 6,100 m). At all other heights, the Spitfire had a 60mph (97km/h) speed {{advantage over the}} Fw 190A. The Spitfire had a considerably faster rate of climb at all altitudes. In the dive the Fw 190A gained slightly in the initial stages. The Spitfire could outturn the Fw 190, though in a right-hand turn this was less pronounced. The Fw 190 was far faster in the roll. It was suggested that if a Spitfire XIV was in the defensive, it should use its fast maximum climb and turning circle to escape. In the offensive the Spitfire could [...] "mix it", but <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fw 190As fast roll rate and dive. If the Fw 190 was allowed to do this, the Spitfire probably would not close the range until the Fw 190 pilot had {{to pull out of}} the dive.|$|E
2500|$|Conglomeration of syncretic beliefs: A {{wide variety}} of {{academic}} sources define Alevism as a syncretic religion, combining diverse religious beliefs, which developed from Islam, Buddhist-influenced Turkic shamanism, and some elements of Christianity. According to Turkish university research conducted in 2005 by a researcher named Soner Cagaptay, 44% of respondents who called themselves [...] "Alevis" [...] self-identify as Muslim and 56% do not. Nevertheless, one <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fact that the university survey which was conducted at a specific location may not reflect the accurate results all the time, and there exists a high probability that the group who had been surveyed might belong to the non-Muslim Ishikists. Moreover, one should always {{bear in mind that}} some members of the non-muslim communities like Kurdish Yâresân (Ahl-i Haqq) and Ishik-Alevis define/identify themselves under the title of Alawism as well. Henceforth, it is always possible either to enlarge or to shrink the borders of the Alevism with respect to which of these definitions are going to be used.|$|E
