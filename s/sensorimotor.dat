5|$|Some psychologists {{believe that}} 'while object {{permanence}} alone may not predict communicative achievement, object permanence {{along with several}} other <b>sensorimotor</b> milestones, plays a critical role in, and interacts with, the communicative development of children with severe disabilities'. This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery of object permanence {{is one of the}} milestones that ties into a child's ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with language acquisition, object permanence is also related to the achievement of self-recognition. This same study also focused specifically on the effects that Down syndrome has on object permanence. They found that the reason why the children that participated were so successful in acquiring object permanence, was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, another factor that could impact children with Down syndrome could also be the willingness of the child to cooperate.|$|E

25|$|Piaget (1953) {{described}} {{three kinds}} of intellectual structures: behavioural (or <b>sensorimotor)</b> schemata, symbolic schemata, and operational schemata.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{psychotherapy}} approaches {{have been designed}} with the treatment of trauma in mind—EMDR, progressive counting (PC), somatic experiencing, biofeedback, Internal Family Systems Therapy, and <b>sensorimotor</b> psychotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Alcoholic {{polyneuropathy}} is {{very similar}} to other axonal degenerative polyneuropathies and therefore can be difficult to diagnose. When alcoholics have <b>sensorimotor</b> polyneuropathy as well as a nutritional deficiency, a diagnosis of alcoholic polyneuropathy is often reached.|$|E
25|$|The first BCI {{session with}} 100% {{accuracy}} (based on 80 right-hand and 80 left-hand movement imaginations) {{was recorded in}} 1998 by Christoph Guger. The BCI system used 27 electrodes overlaying the <b>sensorimotor</b> cortex, weighted the electrodes with Common Spatial Patterns, calculated the running variance and used a linear discriminant analysis.|$|E
25|$|Murine {{models are}} widely used to test {{hypotheses}} linking genetic components of various diseases with <b>sensorimotor</b> gating. While some of the hypotheses stand to the test, others are not, as some mice models show unchanged or increased PPI contrary to the expectations, as in the tests of COMT-deficient mice.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} <b>sensorimotor</b> problems astronauts will face during a {{stay on the}} Moon and Mars are likely to occur when walking around in their space suits. The suits are big and bulky and change the body's center of gravity. This along with the uneven terrain and limited field of view makes locomotion challenging.|$|E
25|$|Hemifacial <b>sensorimotor</b> {{seizures}} {{are often}} entirely localised {{in the lower}} lip or spread to the ipsilateral hand. Motor manifestations are sudden, continuous or bursts of clonic contractions, usually lasting from {{a few seconds to}} a minute. Ipsilateral tonic deviation of the mouth is also common. Hemifacial sensory symptoms consist of unilateral numbness mainly {{in the corner of the}} mouth.|$|E
25|$|Motor imagery {{involves}} {{the imagination of}} the movement of various body parts resulting in <b>sensorimotor</b> cortex activation, which modulates <b>sensorimotor</b> oscillations in the EEG. This can be detected by the BCI to infer a user's intent. Motor imagery typically requires a number of sessions of training before acceptable control of the BCI is acquired. These training sessions may take a number of hours over several days before users can consistently employ the technique with acceptable levels of precision. Regardless of the duration of the training session, users are unable to master the control scheme. This results in very slow pace of the gameplay. Advance machine learning methods were recently developed to compute a subject-specific model for detecting the performance of motor imagery. The top performing algorithm from BCI Competition IV dataset 2 for motor imagery is the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern, developed by Ang et al. from A*STAR, Singapore).|$|E
25|$|At {{the core}} of HTM are {{learning}} algorithms that can store, learn, infer and recall high-order sequences. Unlike most other machine learning methods, HTM learns time-based patterns in unlabeled data on a continuous basis. HTM is robust to noise and high capacity, meaning that it can learn multiple patterns simultaneously. When applied to computers, HTM is well suited for prediction, anomaly detection, classification and ultimately <b>sensorimotor</b> applications.|$|E
25|$|Music {{therapy has}} {{multiple}} benefits which {{contribute to the}} maintenance of health and the drive toward rehabilitation for children. Advanced technology that can monitor cortical activity offers a look at how music engages and produces changes in the brain during the perception and production of musical stimuli. Music therapy, when used with other rehabilitation methods, has increased the success rate of <b>sensorimotor,</b> cognitive, and communicative rehabilitation.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} has focused on the idea that when people access a word's meaning, <b>sensorimotor</b> information that is used to perceive and act on the concrete object the word suggests is automatically activated. In the theory of grounded cognition, the meaning of a particular word is grounded in the <b>sensorimotor</b> systems. For example, when one thinks of a pear, knowledge of grasping, chewing, sights, sounds, and tastes used to encode episodic experiences of a pear are recalled through <b>sensorimotor</b> simulation. A grounded simulation approach refers to context-specific re-activations that integrate the important features of episodic experience into a current depiction. Such {{research has}} challenged previously utilized amodal views. The brain encodes multiple inputs such as words and pictures to integrate and create a larger conceptual idea by using amodal views (also known as amodal perceptions. Instead of being representations in modality-specific systems, semantic memory representations had previously been viewed as redescriptions of modality-specific states. Some accounts of category-specific semantic deficits that are amodal remain even though researchers are beginning to find support for theories in which knowledge is tied to modality-specific brain regions. This research defines a clear link between episodic experiences and semantic memory. The concept that semantic representations are grounded across modality-specific brain regions can be supported by the fact that episodic and semantic memory appear to function in different yet mutually dependent ways. The distinction between semantic and episodic memory has {{become a part of the}} broader scientific discourse. For example, it has been speculated that semantic memory captures the stable aspects of our personality while episodes of illness may have a more episodic nature.|$|E
25|$|Deficits of prepulse {{inhibition}} {{manifest in}} the inability to filter out the unnecessary information; they {{have been linked to}} abnormalities of <b>sensorimotor</b> gating. Such deficits are noted in patients suffering from illnesses like schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, and in people under the influence of drugs, surgical manipulations, or mutations. Human studies of PPI have been summarised in reviews by Braff et al. (2001) and Swerdlow et al. (2008).|$|E
25|$|A severe {{problem of}} phonetic or <b>sensorimotor</b> models of speech {{processing}} (like DIVA or ACT) {{is that the}} development of the phonemic map during speech acquisition is not modeled. A possible solution of this problem could be a direct coupling of action repository and mental lexicon without explicitly introducing a phonemic map at the beginning of speech acquisition (even at the beginning of imitation training; see Kröger et al. 2011 PALADYN Journal of Behavioral Robotics).|$|E
25|$|Measuring consumers' {{conscious}} and subconscious through studying their biological <b>sensorimotor,</b> {{cognitive and affective}} response to marketing stimuli, called neuromarketing, is of increasing interest to marketers {{in order to gain}} insight into how they consume. Dawkins (1989) explained that when we die we leave behind genes and memes; genes being the unit of genetic information, and memes the units of cultural information. Neuromarketing aims to examine the memory of these memes in order to manipulate them.|$|E
25|$|Experiments have {{revealed}} that nonsynaptic changes take place during conditional learning.Woody et al. demonstrated that eyeblink conditioning (EBC), a form of classical conditioning for studying neural structures and mechanisms underlying learning and memory, in a cat is associated with increased excitability and input in the neurons in <b>sensorimotor</b> cortical areas and in the facial nucleus. It was observed that increasing excitability from classical conditioning continued after the response stopped. This suggests that increased excitability may function as a mechanism for memory storage.|$|E
25|$|PPI deficits {{represent}} a well-described finding in schizophrenia, {{with the first}} report dating back to 1978. The abnormalities are also noted in unaffected relatives of the patients. In one study, patients failed to show increased PPI to attended prepulses. Dopamine, which {{plays a major role}} in schizophrenia, had been shown to regulate <b>sensorimotor</b> gating in rodent models. These findings fit to the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. In theory, PPI disruption in schizophrenia may be related to the processes of sensory flooding and cognitive fragmentation.|$|E
25|$|This group, {{part of the}} Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies, Italian National Research Council (ISTC-CNR) in Rome {{and founded}} in 2006 is {{currently}} led by Gianluca Baldassarre. It has two objectives: (a) understanding the brain mechanisms underlying learning and expression of <b>sensorimotor</b> behaviour, and related motivations and higher-level cognition grounded on it, {{on the basis of}} embodied computational models; (b) transferring the acquired knowledge to building innovative controllers for autonomous humanoid robots capable of learning in an open-ended fashion on the basis of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{manufacturing}} tools {{for the use}} of extracting for western lowland gorillas, gorillas are able to adapt tools to a particular use by selecting branches, removing projections such as leaves and bark and adapting their length to the depth of the holes. It appears that they also anticipate the use of the tool since they begin with biggest sticks available and progressively modify it until it is the perfect fit for inserting into a hole that contains food. This demonstrates the gorillas' acquisition of high level <b>sensorimotor</b> intelligence similar to that of young human children.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{empirical}} evidence indicates the significant impact {{of physical activity}} on brain function; for example, greater amounts of physical activity are associated with enhanced cognitive function in older adults. The effects of physical activity can be distributed throughout the whole brain, such as higher gray matter density and white matter integrity after exercise training, and/or on specific brain areas, such as greater activation in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Neuroplasticity is also the underlying mechanism of skill acquisition. For example, after long-term training, pianists showed greater gray matter density in <b>sensorimotor</b> cortex and white matter integrity in the internal capsule compared to non-musicians.|$|E
25|$|Semantic {{memory is}} also {{discussed}} {{in reference to}} modality. Different components represent information from different <b>sensorimotor</b> channels. Modality specific impairments are divided into separate subsystems {{on the basis of}} input modality. Examples of different input modalities include visual, auditory and tactile input. Modality specific impairments are also divided into subsystems based on the type of information. Visual vs. verbal and perceptual vs. functional information are examples of information types. Modality specificity can account for category specific impairments in semantic memory disorders. Damage to visual semantics primarily impairs knowledge of living things, and damage to functional semantics primarily impairs knowledge of nonliving things.|$|E
25|$|Body psychotherapy, part of {{the field}} of somatic psychology, focuses on the link between the mind and the body and tries to access deeper levels of the psyche through greater {{awareness}} of the physical body and emotions. There are various body-oriented approaches, such as Reichian (Wilhelm Reich) character-analytic vegetotherapy and orgonomy; neo-Reichian bioenergetic analysis; somatic experiencing; integrative body psychotherapy; Ron Kurtz's Hakomi psychotherapy; <b>sensorimotor</b> psychotherapy; Biosynthesis psychotherapy; and Biodynamic psychotherapy. These approaches are {{not to be confused with}} body work or body-therapies that seek to improve primarily physical health through direct work (touch and manipulation) on the body, rather than through directly psychological methods.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} has suggested {{a link between}} a child's abilities to gain information about {{the world around them}} and having the ability to override emotions in order to behave appropriately. One study required children to perform a task from a series of psychological tests, with their performance used as a measure of executive function. The tests included assessments of: executive functions (self-regulation, monitoring, attention, flexibility in thinking), language, <b>sensorimotor,</b> visuospatial, and learning, in addition to social perception. The findings suggested that the development of Theory of Mind in younger children is linked to executive control abilities with development impaired in individuals who exhibit signs of executive dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|One-third of {{patients}} have their tumors discovered {{because they have}} an associated autoimmune disorder. As mentioned earlier, {{the most common of}} those conditions is myasthenia gravis (MG); 10–15% {{of patients}} with MG have a thymoma and, conversely, 30–45% of patients with thymomas have MG. Additional associated autoimmune conditions include thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity, pure red cell aplasia and Good syndrome (thymoma with combined immunodeficiency and hypogammaglobulinemia). Other reported disease associations are with acute pericarditis, agranulocytosis, alopecia areata, ulcerative colitis, Cushing's disease, hemolytic anemia, limbic encephalopathy, myocarditis, nephrotic syndrome, panhypopituitarism, pernicious anemia, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, <b>sensorimotor</b> radiculopathy, stiff person syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and thyroiditis.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{adequate}} folate may produce {{a form of}} dementia considered to be reversible with administration of the vitamin. Indeed, there is a degree of improvement in memory associated with folate treatment. In a 3-year longitudinal study {{of men and women}} aged 50–70 years with elevated homocysteine plasma concentration, researchers found that a daily oral folic acid supplementation of 800μg resulted in an increase in folate levels and a decrease in homocysteine levels within blood plasma. In addition to these results, improvements of memory, and information-processing speed, as well as slight improvements of <b>sensorimotor</b> speed were observed, which suggests there is a link between homocysteine and cognitive performance.|$|E
25|$|Research done {{in animals}} {{has shown that}} {{subjects}} recovering in an enriched environment 15 days after having a stroke had significantly improved neurobehavioral function. In addition these same subjects showed greater capability of learning and larger infarct post-intervention {{than those who were}} not in an enriched environment. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment had a considerable beneficial effect on the learning and <b>sensorimotor</b> functions on animals post-stroke. A 2013 study also found that environmental enrichment socially benefits patients recovering from stroke. Researchers in that study concluded that stroke patients in enriched environments in assisted-care facilities {{are much more likely to}} be engaging with other patients during normal social hours instead of being alone or sleeping.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sensorimotor</b> {{deficits and}} neurochemical changes were {{observed}} in rats that were exposed to low doses of 56Fe-ions. Doses that are below 1 Gy reduce performance, as tested by the wire suspension test. Behavioral changes were observed as early as 3 days after radiation exposure and lasted up to 8 months. Biochemical studies showed that the K+-evoked release of dopamine was significantly reduced in the irradiated group, together with an alteration of the nerve signaling pathways. A negative result was reported by Pecaut et al., in which no behavioral effects were seen in female C57/BL6 mice in a 2- to 8-week period following their exposure to 0, 0.1, 0.5 or 2 Gy accelerated 56Fe-ions (1 GeV/u56Fe) as measured by open-field, rotorod, or acoustic startle habituation.|$|E
25|$|Sensory and <b>sensorimotor</b> {{disturbances}} when {{arriving in}} low Earth orbit are well documented, the most known of these being space motion sickness (SMS). Individual differences, spacecraft size, and body movements cause SMS symptoms. Typically lasting {{the first three}} or four days of weightlessness, symptoms range from headaches and fatigue to nausea and vomiting. The consequences vary from simple discomfort to possible incapacitation, creating potential problems during extra-vehicular activity, re-entry, and emergency egress from the spacecraft. The body receives a variety of conflicting signals from the visual, somato-sensory, and vestibular organs in weightlessness. These conflicting inputs are thought to be the primary cause of SMS, but the precise mechanisms of the conflict are not well understood. Medications currently used to alleviate the symptoms produce undesirable side effects.|$|E
25|$|A {{feature that}} distinguishes humans from most animals {{is that we}} are not born with an {{extensive}} repertoire of behavioral programs that would enable us to survive on our own ("physiological prematurity"). To compensate for this, we have an unmatched ability to learn, i.e., to consciously acquire such programs by imitation or exploration. Once consciously acquired and sufficiently exercised, these programs can become automated to the extent that their execution happens beyond the realms of our awareness. Take, as an example, the incredible fine motor skills exerted in playing a Beethoven piano sonata or the <b>sensorimotor</b> coordination required to ride a motorcycle along a curvy mountain road. Such complex behaviors are possible only because a sufficient number of the subprograms involved can be executed with minimal or even suspended conscious control. In fact, the conscious system may actually interfere somewhat with these automated programs.|$|E
25|$|Action {{myoclonus}} {{is characterized}} by muscular jerking triggered or intensified by voluntary movement or even the intention to move. It may be made worse by attempts at precise, coordinated movements. Action myoclonus is the most disabling form of myoclonus and can affect the arms, legs, face, and even the voice. It {{is often associated with}} tonic-clonic seizures and diffuse neuronal disease such as post-hypoxic encephalopathy, uremia, and the various forms of PME, although, in the case of focal cerebral damage, the disease may be restricted to one limb. This type of myoclonus often is caused by brain damage that results from a lack of oxygen and blood flow to the brain when breathing or heartbeat is temporarily stopped. Over-excitement of the <b>sensorimotor</b> cortex (cortical reflex myoclonus) or reticular formation (reticular reflex myoclonus) is also a cause of action myoclonus. Serotonin and GABA neurotransmitters are thought to cause this lack of inhibition, which is a possible explanation as to why improvements are made with the administration of serotonin precursors. Systems involved include the cerebellodentatorubral, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, optic, auditory, posterior columns and gracile and cuneate nuclei, spinocerebellar tracts, motor neurons of cranial nerves and anterior horns, and muscle fibers.|$|E
25|$|Similarly to the ventral stream's {{auditory}} processing, information {{enters the}} ear {{and then into}} the superior temporal gyrus and then finally the superior temporal sulcus. From there the information moves {{to the beginning of the}} dorsal pathway, which is located at the boundary of the temporal and parietal lobes near the Sylvian fissure. The first step of the dorsal pathway begins in the <b>sensorimotor</b> interface, located in the left Sylvian parietal temporal (Spt) (within the Sylvian fissure at the parietal-temporal boundary). The spt is important for perceiving and reproducing sounds. This is evident because its ability to acquire new vocabulary, be disrupted by lesions and auditory feedback on speech production, articulatory decline in late-onset deafness and the non-phonological residue of Wernicke's aphasia; deficient self-monitoring. It is also important for the basic neuronal mechanisms for phonological short-term memory. Without the Spt, language acquisition is impaired. The information then moves onto the articulatory network, which is divided into two separate parts. The articulatory network 1, which processes motor syllable programs, is located in the left posterior inferior temporal gyrus and Brodmann's area 44 (pIFG-BA44). The articulatory network 2 is for motor phoneme programs and is located in the left M1-vBA6.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to its direct role in motor control, the cerebellum is necessary for several types of motor learning, most notably learning to adjust to changes in <b>sensorimotor</b> relationships. Several theoretical models {{have been developed to}} explain <b>sensorimotor</b> calibration in terms of synaptic plasticity within the cerebellum. These models derive from those formulated by David Marr and James Albus, based on the observation that each cerebellar Purkinje cell receives two dramatically different types of input: one comprises thousands of weak inputs from the parallel fibers of the granule cells; the other is an extremely strong input from a single climbing fiber. The basic concept of the Marr–Albus theory is that the climbing fiber serves as a [...] "teaching signal", which induces a long-lasting change in the strength of parallel fiber inputs. Observations of long-term depression in parallel fiber inputs have provided support for theories of this type, but their validity remains controversial.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 80s, several {{researchers}} advocated {{a completely new}} approach to artificial intelligence, based on robotics. They believed that, to show real intelligence, a machine {{needs to have a}} body — it needs to perceive, move, survive and deal with the world. They argued that these <b>sensorimotor</b> skills are essential to higher level skills like commonsense reasoning and that abstract reasoning was actually the least interesting or important human skill (see Moravec's paradox). They advocated building intelligence [...] "from the bottom up." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{literature}} concerning artificial intelligence, Searle's essay has been {{second only to}} Turing's in the volume of debate it has generated. [...] Searle himself was vague about what extra ingredients {{it would take to}} make a machine conscious: all he proposed was that what was needed was [...] "causal powers" [...] of the sort that the brain has and that computers lack. But other thinkers sympathetic to his basic argument have suggested that the necessary (though perhaps still not sufficient) extra conditions may include the ability to pass not just the verbal version of the Turing test, but the robotic version, which requires grounding the robot's words in the robot's <b>sensorimotor</b> capacity to categorize and interact with the things in the world that its words are about, Turing-indistinguishably from a real person. Turing-scale robotics is an empirical branch of research on embodied cognition and situated cognition.|$|E
500|$|The {{more complex}} {{procedure}} {{is known as}} a neurological examination, and is usually carried out by a neurologist in a hospital setting. [...] A formal neurological examination runs through a precisely delineated series of tests, beginning with tests for basic <b>sensorimotor</b> reflexes, and culminating with tests for sophisticated use of language. [...] The outcome may be summarized using the Glasgow Coma Scale, which yields a number in the range 3—15, with a score of 3 to 8 indicating coma, and 15 indicating full consciousness. [...] The Glasgow Coma Scale has three subscales, measuring the best motor response (ranging from [...] "no motor response" [...] to [...] "obeys commands"), the best eye response (ranging from [...] "no eye opening" [...] to [...] "eyes opening spontaneously") and the best verbal response (ranging from [...] "no verbal response" [...] to [...] "fully oriented"). [...] There is also a simpler pediatric version of the scale, for children too young {{to be able to use}} language.|$|E
