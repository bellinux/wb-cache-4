5|$|<b>Strong</b> <b>winds</b> {{in southwestern}} Haiti from the {{hurricane}} {{damaged or destroyed}} hundreds of trees. The path of Flora over the area was best determined by the trajectory of fallen trees across the peninsula. The <b>strong</b> <b>winds</b> left entire villages roofless, with many buildings entirely destroyed. The combination of rough waves and <b>strong</b> <b>winds</b> destroyed three entire communities. Many {{of those who died}} in southwestern Haiti suffered from intense burns from <b>strong</b> <b>winds.</b> In most areas, crops were entirely destroyed. The coffee crop was harvested prior to the arrival of the hurricane, though heavy rainfall and severe flooding ruined the crop for later years. Additionally, <b>strong</b> <b>winds</b> downed shading trees for the coffee crop on the southern peninsula. One official estimated it would require three years for the coffee crop to be replanted and regrown.|$|E
5|$|As a {{developing}} tropical cyclone over the Leeward Islands, Anna produced <b>strong</b> <b>winds</b> over Grenada, though damage {{was limited to}} some crops, trees, and telephone poles. Other islands experienced gusty winds, but no damage. Passing just north of Venezuela, the hurricane produced <b>strong</b> <b>winds</b> over the country, peaking as high as 70mph (115km/h). <b>Strong</b> <b>winds</b> caused widespread damage in northern Honduras. Throughout the country, at least 36homes were destroyed and 228were damaged. Severe damage in the Gracias a Dios Department left hundreds of people homeless. Additionally, high winds toppled approximately 5,000coconut trees. Overall, Anna caused a fatality and $300,000in damage (1961USD), primarily in Central America.|$|E

40|$|To prevent train {{derailment}} due to <b>strong</b> <b>wind,</b> JR East issues operating restriction orders {{in the event}} of a <b>strong</b> <b>wind.</b> The current operating restriction orders contain some inconsistent points. For example, operating restriction orders are issued after a <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> has been observed, and they remain in force across the board for 30 minutes after <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> is not observed any more. To solve this problem, we are currently engaged in developing a <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> warning system. Using only the time series of the wind velocity data observed on the anemometer installed along the railway tracks, this system predicts the wind velocity about 30 minutes ahead according to the time series analysis technique and issues operating restriction orders. So far we have confirmed the reliability of this system through monitored running and verification of the algorithm using the wind velocity data of meteorological offices. ● Keyword：Train operating restriction order, wind damage, time series analysis *Safety Research Laboratory, Research and Development Center of JR East Group observed by a three-cup anemometers installed along the track. The following shows the operation control decision rule for <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> that is currently in force by JR East: (a) Issue an operating restriction order upon detection of <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> whose velocity exceeds a regulated value (e. g. a wind velocity of 30 meters per second in the general service section...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> on dynamic characteristic of traffic flow, an improved car-following model based on the full velocity difference model is developed in this paper. Wind force is introduced as the influence factor of car-following behavior. Among three components of wind force, lift force and side force are taken into account. The linear stability analysis is carried out and the stability condition of the newly developed model is derived. Numerical analysis is made to explore the effect of <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> on spatial-time evolution of a small perturbation. The {{results show that the}} <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> can significantly affect the stability of traffic flow. Driving safety in <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> is also studied by comparing the lateral force under different wind speeds with the side friction of vehicles. Finally, the fuel consumption of vehicle in <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> condition is explored and the results show that the fuel consumption decreased with the increase of wind speed...|$|R

5|$|Beginning on December29 and {{continuing}} for three days, the storm system {{associated with the}} tornado outbreak caused <b>strong</b> <b>winds</b> across the Texas Panhandle and eastern New Mexico. The winds were further enhanced by isolated showers, and gusts peaked at 79mph (127km/h) in Tatum, New Mexico. Approximately 7mi (11km) west of Levelland, Texas, the winds downed four power poles, sparking a fire that burned nearly 2,000acres (800hectares) of grassland before it was finally contained; the fire caused US$20,000in damage. In Allen, Oklahoma, <b>strong</b> <b>winds</b> associated with one supercell caused an estimated US$20,000 in damage after damaging the carport, chimney, and roof of a house. Hail and <b>strong</b> <b>winds</b> were also reported elsewhere in eastern Oklahoma and southeastern Kansas. Widespread and damaging wind gusts and hail later crossed into northwestern Arkansas, causing US$175,000in damage. Several buildings and homes were destroyed by the strong winds; similar impacts were seen in Missouri and Illinois.|$|E
40|$|For {{analysis}} of wind disaster, {{it is important}} to examine not only wind speed but a lot of geography space information, for example building structure and land use. Use of GIS is very effective to examine structural damage due to <b>strong</b> <b>wind,</b> because GIS can manage and visualize a lot of geography space information about <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> damage. The purpose of this research is to clarify usefulness of GIS to arrange a lot of information and to predict wind damage. In this paper, we examined structural damage in the Hojo, Tsukuba City due to the tornado which occurred on May 6, 2012, as an example. As a result, it was confirmed that use of GIS is effective to analyze damage because of <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> quantitatively.

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} an {{estimation}} of the seasonal distribution of <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> and storm weather situations in an ECHAM 3 /T 42 climate model simulation in relation to observed conditions. Observational data of the German Eight and the southern Baltic Sea are taken to compare observations and climate model simulation.

A new objective classification routine for detecting single <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> and storm weather situations (Bft 7 and more) in coarse resolution models is used to validate the large-scale parameters of those events in the climate simulation. The objective classification routine is able to detect <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> and storm weather situations of two flow regimes in the German Eight in winter.

40|$|A {{substantial}} part of South Africa is subject {{to more than one}} <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> source. The effect of that on extreme winds is that higher quantiles are usually estimated with a mixed <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> climate estimation method, compared to the traditional Gumbel approach based on a single population. The differences in the estimated quantiles between the two methods depend on the values of the Gumbel distribution parameters for the different <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> mechanisms involved. Cluster analysis of the distribution parameters provides a characterization of the effect of the relative differences in their values, and therefore the dominance of the different <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> mechanisms. For gusts, cold fronts tend to dominate over the coastal and high-lying areas, while other mechanisms, especially thunderstorms, are dominant over the lower-lying areas in the interior. For the hourly mean wind speeds cold fronts are dominant in the south-west, south and east of the country. On the West Coast the ridging of the Atlantic Ocean high-pressure system dominate in the south, while the presence of a deep trough or coastal low pressure system is the main <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> mechanism in the north. In the central interior cold fronts tend to share their influence almost equally with other synoptic-scale mechanisms...|$|R
