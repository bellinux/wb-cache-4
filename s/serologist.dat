With this end in view, the author circulated to the <b>serologists</b> of institutes concerned a detailed questionnaire on the assay methods used for the determination of the neutralization potency of the various types of antivenins prepared under their direction.

40|$|<b>Serologists</b> {{are making}} {{increasing}} {{use of the term}} "reproducibility" when referring to the reliability or repeatability of serological tests. The practical use of the concept, however, has been limited by the absence of an appropriate numerical scale on which differing reproducibilities can be quantified and objectively compared. This limitation can be overcome by adopting the proposed quantitative measure of reproducibility. The recommended measure is a natural extension of the common practice of considering a serological test to be acceptably reporducible so long as replicate titers remain within a twofold range. The measure can be readily used in the field of serology, and examples are given of how this can be done...|$|R

Among the most difficult cases for law enforcement and medicolegal investigators to investigate are those in which victims have been deliberately burned to cover up a crime, or those in which cremation has resulted from an accident or suicide.

The major objective in these investigations are twofold: The first task is to identify the body using every means available, including the aid of such experts as forensic pathologists, forensic anthropologists, dentists, toxicologists, and <b>serologists</b> as well as fire investigators, who can contribute to the investigation by providing information about the course of the fire. peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|Arnault Tzanck's name is {{attached}} to an apparatus he invented that was widely used for transfusing blood in France between the wars, {{as well as a}} simple test he devised using the microscopic analysis of scrapings from skin cancer lesions, different ganglia, and some forms of dermatitis especially pemphigus. The Tzanck smear is still widely used as a test for herpes, among other diseases. He also experimented with different methods of preserving blood and blood substitutes. Tzanck's most lasting contribution was in the organization of blood transfusion in France that eventually resulted {{in the creation of the}} Centre National de Transfusion Sanguine (National Blood Transfusion Center), which was established in 1949 with Tzanck as its first director. In the process, Tzanck educated a whole generation of <b>serologists</b> and immunologists, including Jean Dausset, Marcel Bessis, and Jean Pierre Soulier.|$|R
40|$|There were taxonomists {{before there}} were biochemists and <b>serologists,</b> cyto-logists and geneticists, and modern taxonomic {{practice}} as applied to both macro- and micro-organisms shows abundant evidence of the naturalist’s traditional approach. Both {{before and after the}} application of diverse special techniques to taxonomy, however, systematists have frequently felt it neces-sary to employ criteria which would allow them to summate characteristics which could be defined only by workers in other disciplines. Among such criteria the relationship of the parasite to the host takes pride of place for pathogenic micro-organisms and it is to aspects of this relationship that I wish to draw attention. The host-parasite relationship could be discussed compre-hensively only on a symposium scale, for in addition to the species concept, the genetics and physiology of both host and parasite are among the many major questions involved and I must, therefore, confine myself to illustrating by examples chosen mainly from the fungi two aspects of the problem: the taxonomic use of what may be termed the spatial relation of the parasite t...|$|R

40|$|First {{published}} in 1992, The Discourse of Race in Modern China rapidly became a classic, showing {{for the first}} time on the basis of detailed evidence how and why racial categorisation became so widespread in China. After the country’s devastating defeat against Japan in 1895, leading reformers like Yan Fu, Liang Qichao and Kang Youwei turned away from the Confucian classics to seek enlightenment abroad, hoping to find the keys to wealth and power on the distant shores of Europe. Instead, they discovered the notion of ‘race’, and used new evolutionary theories from Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer to present a universe red in tooth and claw in which ‘yellows’ competed with ‘whites’ in a deadly struggle for survival. After the fall of the empire in 1911, prominent politicians and writers in republican China continued to measure, classify and rank people from around the world according to their supposed biological features, all in the name of science. Racial thinking remains popular in the People’s Republic of China, as <b>serologists,</b> geneticists and anthropometrists continue to interpret human variation in terms of ‘race’.
