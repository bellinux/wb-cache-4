6000|$|... § XXIV. Fig. XXXIV. is the masonry of the <b>side</b> <b>arch</b> of, {{as far as}} I know or am able to judge, {{the most}} perfect Gothic sepulchral {{monument}} in the world, the foursquare canopy of the (nameless?)[49] tomb standing over the small cemetery gate of the Church of St. Anastasia at Verona. I shall have frequent occasion to recur to this monument, and, I believe, shall be able sufficiently to justify the terms in which I speak of it: meanwhile, I desire only that the reader should observe the severity and simplicity of the arch lines, the exquisitely delicate suggestion of the ogee curve in the apex, and chiefly {{the use of the}} cusp in giving inward weight to the great pieces of stone on the flanks of the arch, and preventing their thrust outwards from being severely thrown on the lowermost stones. The effect of this arrangement is, that the whole massy canopy is sustained safely by four slender pillars (as will be seen hereafter in the careful plate I hope to give of it), these pillars being rather steadied than materially assisted against the thrust, by iron bars, about an inch thick, connecting them at the heads of the abaci; a feature of peculiar importance in this monument, inasmuch as we know it {{to be part of the}} original construction, by a beautiful little Gothic wreathed pattern, like one of the hems of garments of Fra Angelico, running along the iron bar itself. So carefully, and so far, is the system of decoration carried out in this pure and lovely monument, my most beloved throughout all the length and breadth of Italy;--chief, as I think, among all the sepulchral marbles of a land of mourning.|$|E

50|$|Following {{a three-year}} {{planning}} phase on 7 July 1840 the city appointed Karl Emanuel Müller {{as the lead}} engineer on the Nydegg Bridge project. Starting in August 1840, crews worked throughout the winter of 1840/41 to build coffer dams and prepare the foundations for the bridge pillars. Despite severe floods and other delays by May 1841 the pillars were in place and above water level. The cornerstone ceremony took place in early June of the same year. In the fall of 1841 construction began on the eastern <b>side</b> <b>arch</b> and by the following fall both the western and eastern side arches were finished. With the side arches finished, {{in the winter of}} 1842 workers began building the scaffolding for the larger central arch. By the summer of 1843, the central arch was completed and on 14-15 September 1843 the placing of the keystone was celebrated with cannon fire, speeches and a feast. With major construction completed, the scaffolding was dismantled and work began on the decoration and roadway on the bridge. On 23 November 1844 the bridge was dedicated with a celebration attended by the entire city. The entire project cost about 1,650,000 Franks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} make the actual state of the bridge into the ideal state of maximum, we make {{real-time}} monitoring in the key parts of the bridge, and adjust to the design of the data to ensure the safety and reliability of arch bridge in the course of construction. Combined with the construction monitoring of the Sihe Bridge, this paper introduces the main bridge construction process on the large span tied arch bridge. Based on the construction monitoring of Sihe Bridge, this paper introduces the main contents and methods of monitoring point location, monitoring control of construction process, and discussed the construction monitoring technology of long-span X-style tied arch bridge. 1 Engineering Survey The main bridge of Sihe Bridge consists double-basket handle tied arch and V type rigid frame bridge pier. The bridge adopts symmetrical layout of 30 m+ 120 m+ 30 m. The main arch rib is seated on the vertical plane, and the rise-to-span ratio is 1 / 3. 85. The <b>side</b> <b>arch</b> rib is located in the inclined plane which intersects the vertical plane at 8 °, and the rise-to-span ratio is 1 / 3. 81. The V type rigid frame of the bridge pier contains the main and the auxiliary rigid frame, which connected by beam on lateral aspect. The main and the auxiliary arch rib connected by lateral braces are connected to the beams of the V type rigid frame at the position of arch springing. Traffic lane girder with a span of 4. 2 m adopts precast reinforced concrete π type beam, whose way of connection is simple-supported after consolidation. The beam is of variable cross-section prestressed concrete structure, the length range from 55 m as the longest to 47. 9 m as the shortest Suspender. The overall layout of the bridge is show...|$|E

5000|$|The churchyard walls, railings, gate piers {{and gates}} to the {{south-east}} {{of the church}} were designated as Grade II* listed buildings on 15 August 1974. The wrought iron churchyard gates date from 1759, and the rusticated stone piers with <b>side</b> <b>arches</b> are from the 1830s.|$|R
50|$|The central arch {{is made of}} 28 thin, curved {{limestone}} slabs {{which are}} joined with iron dovetails. This allows the arch to adjust to shifts in its supports and prevents the bridge from collapsing even when {{a segment of the}} arch breaks. The bridge has two small <b>side</b> <b>arches</b> on either <b>side</b> of the main <b>arch.</b> These <b>side</b> <b>arches</b> serve two important functions: first, they reduce the total weight of the bridge by about 15.3% or approximately 700 tons, which is vital because of the low rise-to-span ratio and the large forces on the abutments it creates. Second, when the bridge is submerged during a flood, they allow water to pass through, thereby reducing the forces on the structure of the bridge.|$|R
40|$|Sexpartite vaults {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} interesting chapters in European Gothic architecture. Originally, the use of the square cross-ribbed vault was limited to relatively small spaces, but when the need arose to cover spaces of considerable size, a new vault with very peculiar characteristics appeared. This new vault was a cross-ribbed vault that was reinforced in the centre by a rib that was parallel to the transverse ribs which effectively divided the vault in half. This configuration breaks the <b>side</b> <b>arch</b> into two fragments, creating a pair of windows on each side. The volumetrics of these vaults is extremely complex and the difficulties involved in their construction perhaps explain why they were abandoned in favour of the simple cross ribbed vault, now with rectangular sections. The existence of the sexpartite vault barely lasted more than fifty years, from the end of the XII century and the beginning of the XIII. Towards the end of the 19 th century Viollet-le-Duc gave a succinct explanation of this type of vault. A. Choisy also, later, devotes some pages to the French sexpartite vault; since then, the subject has only been broached in a few references in later studies on Gothic architecture. However, despite its short period of existence, the sexpartite vault spread throughout Europe and was used to build important vaulting. Viollet-le-Duc's sexpartite vault could be considered to be the prototype of them all, while it is true that the studies that we have conducted so far lead us to affirm that there is a wide variety of vaults, with different volumetric spaces and different construction strategies. Therefore, we believe that this chapter of international Gothic deserves further study applying the knowledge and resources that are available today. This paper has been written to explore the most significant European sexpartite vaults. New measurement technology has led to a revolution in research into the history of construction, allowing studies to be conducted that were hitherto impossible. Thorough data collection using total station and photogrammetry has enabled us to identify the stereotomy of the voussoirs, tas-de-charges and keystones, as well as the bonding of the surfaces of the severies. A comparison of the construction techniques employed in the different vaults studied reveals common construction features and aspects that are specific to each country. Thus we are able to establish the relationship between sexpartite vaults in different European countries and their influence on each other...|$|E
