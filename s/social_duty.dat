25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Republic, {{religious}} and political offices became more closely intertwined; the office of pontifex maximus became a de facto consular prerogative. Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political, military and priestly powers; at first temporarily, then for his lifetime. He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome's major priesthoods, including that of pontifex maximus; as he invented none, he could claim them as traditional honours. His reforms were represented as adaptive, restorative and regulatory, rather than innovative; most notably his elevation (and membership) of the ancient Arvales, his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality. Augustus obtained the pax deorum, maintained {{it for the rest of}} his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation. This remained a primary {{religious and}} <b>social</b> <b>duty</b> of emperors.|$|E
25|$|Between the {{introduction}} of universal conscription in 1902 until the start of World War II, the army was usually maintained at a consistent strength of 100 000 men, with two-thirds of the force being conscripts for two years. From 1942 onwards, the Swedish government embarked upon a massive and ambitious militarization program in which conscription was strictly enforced and compulsory service was extended for three years. This combined with propaganda about conscription {{being a part of}} <b>social</b> <b>duty</b> and defending the Swedish principle of Folkhemmet, led to an army a size of about 700 000 active duty soldiers in late 1945. Since the late winter of 1945 the size of the army was slowly decreased as entire reserve battalions and brigades were gradually demobilized, and by late 1947 the size of the army was around 170 000 soldiers and was planned to stabilize at such a quantity of personnel.|$|E

500|$|Although female conservatives such as Hannah More excoriated Wollstonecraft personally, they {{actually}} shared {{many of the}} same values. As the scholar Anne Mellor has shown, both More and Wollstonecraft wanted a society founded on [...] "Christian virtues of rational benevolence, honesty, personal virtue, the fulfillment of <b>social</b> <b>duty,</b> thrift, sobriety, and hard work". During the early 1790s, many writers within British society were engaged in an intense debate regarding the position of women in society. For example, the respected poet and essayist Anna Laetitia Barbauld and Wollstonecraft sparred back and forth; Barbauld published several poems responding to Wollstonecraft's work and Wollstonecraft commented on them in footnotes to the Rights of Woman. The work also provoked outright hostility. The bluestocking Elizabeth Carter was unimpressed with the work. Thomas Taylor, the Neoplatonist translator who had been a landlord to the Wollstonecraft family in the late 1770s, swiftly wrote a satire called A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes: if women have rights, why not animals too? ...|$|E
500|$|The {{historian}} Vincent Smith, {{the author}} of a biography of Tulsidas' contemporary Akbar, called Tulsidas the greatest man of his age in India and greater than even Akbar himself. The Indologist and linguist Sir George Grierson called Tulsidas [...] "the greatest leader of the people after the Buddha" [...] and [...] "the greatest of Indian authors of modern times"; and the epic Ramcharitmanas [...] "worthy of the greatest poet of any age." [...] The work Ramcharitmanas has been called [...] "the Bible of North India" [...] by both nineteenth century Indologists including Ralph Griffith, who translated the four Vedas and Valmiki's Ramayana into English, and modern writers. Mahatma Gandhi held Tulsidas in high esteem and regarded the Ramcharitmanas as the [...] "greatest book in all devotional literature". The Hindi poet Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala' called Tulsidas [...] "the most fragrant branch of flowers in the garden of the world's poetry, blossoming in the creeper of Hindi". Nirala considered Tulsidas to be a greater poet than Rabindranath Tagore, and in the same league as Kalidasa, Vyasa, Valmiki, Homer, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and William Shakespeare. Hindi litterateur Hazari Prasad Dwivedi wrote that Tulsidas established a [...] "sovereign rule on the kingdom of Dharma in northern India", which was comparable to the impact of Buddha. Edmour J. Babineau, author of the book Love and God and <b>Social</b> <b>Duty</b> in Ramacaritmanasa, says that if Tulsidas was born in Europe or the Americas, he would be considered a greater personality than William Shakespeare. In the words of the archaeologist F. R. Allchin, who translated Vinaypatrika and Kavitavali into English, [...] "for people of a large part of North India Tulsidas claims reverence comparable to that accorded to Luther as translator of the Bible into the native German". Allchin also mentions that the work Ramcharitmanas has been compared to not only the Ramayana of Valmiki, but the Vedas themselves, the Bhagavad Gita, the Kuran and the Bible. Ernest Wood in his work An Englishman Defends Mother India considered the Ramcharitmanas to be [...] "superior to the best books of the Latin and Greek languages." [...] Tulsidas is also referred to as Bhaktaśiromaṇi, meaning the highest jewel among devotees.|$|E

[...] This, he remembered, was a good time, and they talked about {{it for a long time}} together, but now, his good friend had left him and was in the Sand Hills.” ...|$|E

60|$|This was the Class I {{saw at the}} Ragged School.
