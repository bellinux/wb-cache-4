50|$|Weed {{resistance}} to herbicides {{has become a}} major concern in crop production worldwide. Resistance to herbicides is often attributed to lack of rotational programmes of herbicides and to continuous applications of herbicides with the same <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Thus, a true understanding <b>of</b> the <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> herbicides is essential for strategic planning of herbicide-based weed control.|$|R

25|$|Disadvantages of {{injections}} include potential pain or discomfort for {{the patient}} and the requirement of trained staff using aseptic techniques for administration. However, in some cases, patients are taught to self-inject, such as SC injection of insulin in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. As the drug is delivered to the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> extremely rapidly with IV injection, there is a risk of overdose if the dose has been calculated incorrectly, and there is an increased risk of side effects if the drug is administered too rapidly.|$|E
25|$|Toxicodynamics, termed {{pharmacodynamics}} in pharmacology, {{describes the}} dynamic interactions of a toxicant with a biological target and its biological effects. A biological target, {{also known as}} the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> can be binding proteins, ion channels, DNA, or a variety of other receptors. When a toxicant enters an organism, it can interact with these receptors and produce structural or functional alterations. The mechanism of action of the toxicant, as determined by a toxicant’s chemical properties, will determine what receptors are targeted and the overall toxic effect at the cellular level and organismal level.|$|E
25|$|The mode {{of action}} is not exactly known at present, but {{experimental}} evidence indicates praziquantel increases the permeability of the membranes of schistosome cells towards calcium ions. The drug thereby induces contraction of the parasites, resulting in paralysis in the contracted state. The dying parasites are dislodged from their <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> in the host organism and may enter systemic circulation or may be destroyed by host immune reaction (phagocytosis). Additional mechanisms including focal disintegrations and disturbances of oviposition (laying of eggs) are seen in other types of sensitive parasites.|$|E

25|$|Drug {{interactions}} are a complex topic. Some drug interactions can be simplistically classified as either synergistic or inhibitory interactions. In addition, drug interactions can occur {{directly at the}} <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> through common pathways or indirectly through metabolism of the drug in the liver or through elimination in the kidney. Pancuronium and thiopental have different sites of action, one {{in the brain and}} one at the neuromuscular junction. Since the half-life of thiopental is 11.5 hours, the metabolism of the drugs is not an issue when dealing with the short time frame in lethal injections. The only other plausible interpretation would be a direct one, or one in which the two compounds interact with each other. Supporters of the death penalty argue that this theory does not hold true. They state that even if the 100mg of pancuronium directly prevented 500mg of thiopental from working,sufficient thiopental to induce coma would be present for 50 hours. In addition, if this interaction did occur, then the pancuronium would be incapable of causing paralysis.|$|E
25|$|The SSRIs are {{the first}} rationally {{designed}} class of psychotropic medications. The strategy behind rational drug design {{is to develop a}} new drug that is capable of affecting a specific biological target, or in this case a special neural <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> (uptake pumps, receptors), while trying to avoid effects on other site of actions. The goal in such development is to produce pharmacological agents that are more efficacious, safer and better tolerated than older medications. An initial success was achieved when medicinal chemists set out in search of the ideal SSRI with the chemical synthesis of zimelidine (figure 1) from the antihistamine drug brompheniramine, which exhibited selective inhibition of 5-HT re-uptake with minimal inhibition of norepinephrine (NE) re-uptake. Most importantly, zimelidine did not come with the adverse effect profile as the TCAs and therefore it became the template for the second generation SSRIs. Zimelidine was the first SSRI to be marketed, but several cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome were {{associated with the use of}} the drug which led to withdrawal from the market in 1983. Subsequently, several non-tricyclic SSRIs were discovered and marketed. Fluoxetine, which was FDA approved in 1987 and is usually thought to be the first SSRI to be marketed, paved the way for the next generation of SSRIs and was thought to be some kind of prototype. Introduction of fluoxetine to the market is hailed as a miracle drug for the treatment of depression because it had fewer adverse effects, simpler dosing strategies and greater margin of safety when overdoses were consumed and thus it had better adherence, compared to the older antidepressants (TCAs and MAOIs). Since then the number of drugs in the SSRI class has become bigger and they are now six (fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline and fluvoxamine), as demonstrated in table 1.|$|E
500|$|NEDD9 binds {{directly}} to the Aurora-A mitotic kinase at the centrosome, and promotes its activity, allowing cells to enter mitosis. [...] Degradation of NEDD9 {{at the end of}} mitosis contributes to timely Aurora-A degradation. [...] Cell overexpressing NEDD9 exhibit deficient cytokinesis resulting in accumulation of multipolar mitotic spindles and abnormal numbers of centrosomes. On the other hand, cells with depleted NEDD9 have prematurely separated centrosomes and are deficient in microtubule organizing activity at mitosis leading to abundance of monopolar or asymmetric spindles, preventing cells from entering mitosis. NEDD9 also regulates Aurora-A activation at the basal body of cilia as cells resorb cilia during early G1. [...] Cilia are small organelles that protrude from the surface of adherent cells that are the obligate <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> for proteins such as Hedgehog, and the polycystins: by influencing ciliary stability, NEDD9 is positioned to affect these signaling systems. Interaction of NEDD9 with Aurora A kinase may also play a role in tumor invasion. NEDD9 binds to and regulates acetylation of cortactin (CTTN) in an Aurora A kinase (AURKA)/HDAC6–dependent manner. The knockdown of NEDD9 or AURKA results in an increase in the amount of acetylated CTTN and a decrease in the binding of CTTN to F-actin. Overexpression of the deacetylation mimicking (9KR) mutant of CTTN is sufficient to restore actin dynamics at the leading edge and migration proficiency of the tumor cells. Inhibition of AURKA and HDAC6 activity by alisertib and tubastatin A in xenograft models of breast cancer leads to a {{decrease in the number of}} pulmonary metastases.|$|E
40|$|Single-chemical and mixture {{concentration-response}} curves generated using a frog embryo {{model were}} examined for value in assessing whether chemicals exert toxic effects {{at the same}} or at different molecular <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Toxicity tests were conducted {{on a series of}} osteolathyrogens, i. e. chemicals that inhibit cross-linking of developing connective tissue fibers. Induction of osteolathyrism, which manifests as lesions in the notochord of exposed tadpoles, has several possible molecular <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> including agent-cofactor reactivity during the enzyme-mediated cross-linking process. UV-VIS spectrophotometry of osteolathyrogen-cofactor reactivity (i. e. in vitro analysis) was coupled with the 96 -h frog embryo mixture toxicity assay (i. e. in vivo toxicity) to compare molecular <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> for several osteolathyrogens with the combined osteolathyritic effects of the agents. Single-chemical concentration-response curves were used to calculate theoretical curves for the dose-addition model of combined effect. Slope and EC 50 values for both theoretical and experimental mixture curves were then generated to statistically examine the hypothesis that agents with shared <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> have dose-response curve (DRC) slopes that are similar when given alone and in combination, and slope and EC 50 values that, when administered together, are consistent with those calculated for dose-addition. For combinations of cofactor-binding agents (semicarbazide, thiosemicarbazide, aminoacetonitrile), slope values were generally similar with additivity quotients near 1. 0 (1. 0 = dose-additive) and combined osteolathyritic effects that were consistent with dose-addition. None of these were true for combinations that included agents that did not show rapid cofactor binding (beta-aminopropionitrile, methyleneaminoacetonitrile). The results suggest that DRC analysis could be a useful tool for delineating common or different molecular <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> toxic <b>action</b> and that the approaches used warrant further study for evaluating the mechanistic basis for combined effects of toxicants...|$|R
40|$|The {{causes of}} nausea, {{vomiting}} and retching {{and how these}} are brought about are ex-plained, and the present views on the mechanism of vomiting are discussed. The <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> sensory stimuli causing vomiting are linked in a figure with the probable <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> anti-emetic drugs. Three main groups of anti-emetic drugs are discussed, general sedatives and tranquillizers, hyoscine and atropine, and certain antihistamines. The results of some clinical trials are considered and suggestions made for the best combination of drugs. Undesirable side effects, particularly those of the phenothiazines, are stressed so that suitable precautions can be taken in their use. The term "sickness " is used as in motion sickness, radiation sickness and in other forms to describe {{a condition in which}} there may be nausea, retch-ing and vomiting, separately or together.

2500|$|Plexus {{anesthesia}} [...] is {{injection of}} LA {{in the vicinity}} of a nerve plexus, often inside a tissue compartment that limits the diffusion of the drug away from the intended <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> The anesthetic effect extends to the innervation areas of several or all nerves stemming from the plexus.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features of chemical synapses is that they are the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> for the majority of psychoactive drugs. [...] Synapses are affected by drugs such as curare, strychnine, cocaine, morphine, alcohol, LSD, and countless others. These drugs have different effects on synaptic function, and often are restricted to synapses that use a specific neurotransmitter. For example, curare is a poison that stops acetylcholine from depolarizing the postsynaptic membrane, causing paralysis. Strychnine blocks the inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter glycine, which causes the body to pick up and react to weaker and previously ignored stimuli, resulting in uncontrollable muscle spasms. Morphine acts on synapses that use endorphin neurotransmitters, and alcohol increases the inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter GABA. LSD interferes with synapses that use the neurotransmitter serotonin. Cocaine blocks reuptake of dopamine and therefore increases its effects.|$|E

40|$|We have {{examined}} the in vivo <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> for topoisomerases II in the 87 A 7 heat shock locus {{as a function of}} gene activity. When the hsp 70 genes are induced, there is a dramatic redistribution of topoisomerase II in the locus which parallels many of the observed alterations in chromatin structure. In addition to changes in the topoisomerase II distribution within the locus, we find topoisomerase II localized around the putative domain boundaries scs and scs'. During recovery, when the chromatin fiber of the locus recondenses, the major <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> for topoisomerase II appear to be located within the two hsp 70 genes and in the intergenic spacer separating the two genes...|$|R
2500|$|Pharmacokinetics: In pre-clinical trials, it is {{possible}} to radiolabel a new drug and inject it into animals. [...] Such scans are referred to as biodistribution studies. [...] The uptake of the drug, the tissues in which it concentrates, and its eventual elimination, can be monitored far more quickly and cost effectively than the older technique of killing and dissecting the animals to discover the same information. [...] Much more commonly, however, drug occupancy at a purported <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> can be inferred indirectly by competition studies between unlabeled drug and radiolabeled compounds known apriori to bind with specificity to the site. [...] A single radioligand can be used this way to test many potential drug candidates for the same target. [...] A related technique involves scanning with radioligands that compete with an endogenous (naturally occurring) substance at a given receptor to demonstrate that a drug causes the release of the natural substance.|$|E
2500|$|Peptide hormones have {{important}} influences upon the hypothalamus, {{and to do}} so they must pass through the blood–brain barrier. The hypothalamus is bounded in part by specialized brain regions that lack an effective blood–brain barrier; the capillary endothelium at these sites is fenestrated to allow free passage of even large proteins and other molecules. [...] Some of these sites are the sites of neurosecretion - the neurohypophysis and the median eminence. However, others are sites at which the brain samples the composition of the blood. Two of these sites, the SFO (subfornical organ) and the OVLT (organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis) are so-called circumventricular organs, where neurons are in intimate contact with both blood and CSF. These structures are densely vascularized, and contain osmoreceptive and sodium-receptive neurons that control drinking, vasopressin release, sodium excretion, and sodium appetite. They also contain neurons with receptors for angiotensin, atrial natriuretic factor, endothelin and relaxin, each of which important in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance. Neurons in the OVLT and SFO project to the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus, and also to preoptic hypothalamic areas. The circumventricular organs may also be the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> of interleukins to elicit both fever and ACTH secretion, via effects on paraventricular neurons.|$|E
