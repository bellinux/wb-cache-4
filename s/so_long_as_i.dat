500|$|Deveau {{returned}} to report these findings to Morehouse, {{who decided to}} bring the derelict into Gibraltar, [...] away. Under maritime law, a salvor could expect a substantial share of the combined value of rescued vessel and cargo, the exact award depending {{on the degree of}} danger inherent in the salvaging. Morehouse divided Dei Gratias crew of eight between the two vessels, sending Deveau and two experienced seamen to Mary Celeste, while he and four others remained on Dei Gratia. The weather was relatively calm for most of the way to Gibraltar, but with each ship seriously undermanned, progress was slow. Dei Gratia reached Gibraltar on December 12, 1872, and Mary Celeste, which had encountered fog, arrived on the following morning. She was immediately impounded by the vice admiralty court, preparatory to salvage hearings. Deveau wrote to his wife that the ordeal of bringing the ship in was such that [...] "I can hardly tell what I am made of, but I do not care <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> got in safe. I shall be well paid for the Mary Celeste." ...|$|E

[...] "What took place between my father and Miss Crawley can go for nothing with me. He has told me that his allowance to me is to be withdrawn. Let him tell me that he has reconsidered the matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|When, {{a little}} later, R.C. came panting down stream I {{was sitting on}} the bank, all wet, with one knee skinned and I was holding his broken leader in my hands.

Under such {{circumstances}} it was always best to maintain silence and <b>I</b> did <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could. After his paroxysm had spent itself and he had become somewhat near a rational being once more he asked me: ...|$|R
500|$|While {{agency is}} the first of two {{dimensions}} of Dyer's story, the second is allegiance. [...] Dyer became a known in the public eye on the day when Anne Hutchinson was excommunicated, and Dyer took her hand while they walked out of the meeting house together. [...] Dyer had a strong affiliation and allegiance to this older woman who shared the secret of her unfortunate birth. [...] Likewise, two decades later she framed her acts as a means to stand by her friends and share in their fate. [...] In the first of two letters of Dyer's that have been preserved, she wrote to the General Court, [...] "if my Life were freely granted by you, it would not avail me, nor could I expect it of you, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> should daily hear or see the Sufferings of these People, my dear Brethren and Seed, with whom my Life is bound up, as I have done these two years". [...] Traditional bonds for females were to spouses and children, yet in the Quaker community there were strong spiritual bonds that transcended gender boundaries. [...] Thus the Puritan public found it very unusual that Dyer walked to the gallows hand-in-hand between two male friends, and she was asked if she was not ashamed of doing so. [...] This spiritual closeness of the Quakers was very threatening to the Puritan mindset where allegiance was controlled by the male church members. [...] The Quakers allowed their personal bonds to transgress not only gender lines, but also the boundaries of age and class.|$|E

60|$|But I had {{not lost}} my head, my friends. Everything {{was done with}} a purpose. Our fugitives always made for the coast. I was {{determined}} to go inland, and the more so <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had told Beaumont the opposite. I would fly to the north, and they would seek me in the south. Perhaps you will ask me how I could tell which was which on such a night. I answer that it was by the wind. I had observed in the prison that {{it came from the}} north, and <b>so,</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> kept my face to it, I was going in the right direction.|$|R
2500|$|Meanwhile, the {{relations}} between Roman and Duke Leszek I of Poland deteriorated for both religious and personal reasons. Leszek I was a devout Roman Catholic and it was probably at his suggestion that Pope Innocent III sent his envoys to Roman in 1204, urging him to accept Roman Catholicism and promising to place him {{under the protection of}} St Peter’s sword. Roman’s answer, as recorded in the Radziwill chronicle, was characteristic enough: pointing to his own sword he asked the envoys, “Is the Pope’s sword similar to mine? <b>So</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> carry mine, I need no other.” ...|$|E
2500|$|After giving birth, while resting {{near the}} trunk of a palm tree Jesus spoke to Mary from the cradle instructing her to shake the tree and obtain its fruits. After showing Jesus as a newborn to her family Jesus again spoke [...] "Lo, I am God's servant; God has given me the Book, and made me a Prophet. Blessed he has made me, {{wherever}} I may be; and He has enjoined me to pray, and to give alms, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> live and likewise to cherish my mother" [...] in order to dispel rumours of conception. This birth narrative draws strong parallels to the apocryphal tradition of Jesus' birth within the Infancy Gospel of Thomas and Arabic Infancy Gospel.|$|E
2500|$|Diogenes {{arrived in}} Athens with a slave named Manes who {{abandoned}} him shortly thereafter. With characteristic humor, Diogenes dismissed his ill fortune by saying, [...] "If Manes can live without Diogenes, why not Diogenes without Manes?" [...] Diogenes would mock such a relation of extreme dependency. He found {{the figure of}} a master who could do nothing for himself contemptibly helpless. He was attracted by the ascetic teaching of Antisthenes, a student of Socrates. When Diogenes asked Antisthenes to mentor him, Antisthenes ignored him and reportedly [...] "eventually beat him off with his staff". Diogenes responds, [...] "Strike, for you will find no wood hard enough to keep me away from you, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> think you've something to say." [...] Diogenes became Antisthenes' pupil, despite the brutality with which he was initially received. [...] Whether the two ever really met is still uncertain, but he surpassed his master in both reputation and the austerity of his life. He considered his avoidance of earthly pleasures a contrast to and commentary on contemporary Athenian behaviors. This attitude was grounded in a disdain for what he regarded as the folly, pretense, vanity, self-deception, and artificiality of human conduct.|$|E

2500|$|An Essay {{begins with}} a series of letters in which Makin {{establishes}} her audience with her original appeal to “all Ingenious and Virtuous Ladies, more especially to her Highness the Lady Mary, eldest Daughter to his Royal Highness the Duke of York" [...] (Makin 1673). In the introductory epistle, Makin admits that to challenge customs, to imply that women are reasonable creatures who will benefit from learning, is a bold attempt and she expects to meet opposition {{while at the same time}} claiming that the patronage of the Royal Highness will be a form of protection. Here, in Makin's exordium, through the use of kairos, she appeals to her audience's interest and sympathy. While her audience is both male and female, her emotional appeal, the pathos of her treatise, is directed at women, for she writes: “I expect to meet with many scoffs and taunts from inconsiderate and illiterate men, that prize their own lusts and pleasure more than your profit and content” (Makin 1673). She goes on to state: “I shall be the less concerned at these, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am in your favor; and this discourse may be a weapon in your hands to defend yourselves, whilst you endeavor to polish your souls, that you may glorify God" [...] (Makin 1673). She further emphasises [...] "ladies" [...] as her target audience: “I hope I shall not need to beg the patience of ladies to peruse this pamphlet: I have bespoken and do expect your patronage, because it is your cause I plead against an ill custom, prejudicial to you, which men will not willingly suffer to be broken” (Makin 1673).|$|E
