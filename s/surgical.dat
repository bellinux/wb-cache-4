5|$|Betances {{introduced}} new <b>surgical</b> and aseptic {{procedures to}} Puerto Rico. With {{the assistance of}} Venezuelan anesthesiologist Pedro Arroyo, Betances performed the first ever <b>surgical</b> procedure under chloroform in Puerto Rico, in November 1862.|$|E
5|$|For both NSCLC and SCLC, the {{two general}} types of staging {{evaluations}} are clinical staging and <b>surgical</b> staging. Clinical staging is performed prior to definitive surgery. It {{is based on}} the results of imaging studies (such as CT scans and PET scans) and biopsy results. <b>Surgical</b> staging is evaluated either during or after the operation and {{is based on the}} combined results of <b>surgical</b> and clinical findings, including <b>surgical</b> sampling of thoracic lymph nodes.|$|E
5|$|The doctors {{decided that}} Huskisson {{was likely to}} survive but his injured leg was likely to need amputation. With no {{medicines}} or <b>surgical</b> tools, {{they waited for the}} arrival of the <b>surgical</b> equipment and medical specialists Stephenson had gone to summon from Manchester.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{a patient}} was {{reported}} with recurrent upper extremity aneurysms that required <b>surgical</b> repairs.|$|E
5|$|In January 2003, Canadian Brent Moffat set the World Record {{for most}} body {{piercing}}s in one session (700 piercings with 18g <b>surgical</b> needles in 1 session of 7 hours, using play piercing where {{the skin is}} pierced and sometimes jewellery is inserted, which is worn temporarily). In December of the same year, Moffat had 900 piercings in 4½ hours. On 4 March 2006, the record was overturned by Kam Ma, who had 1,015 temporary metal rings inserted in 7 hours and 55 minutes. The record for most body piercings with <b>surgical</b> needles was set on 29 May 2008, when Robert Jesus Rubio allowed 900 18-gauge, -long <b>surgical</b> needles to be inserted into his body.|$|E
5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with <b>surgical</b> treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. <b>Surgical</b> management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and <b>surgical</b> replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E

5|$|Permanent seed {{implantation}} {{is often}} a less invasive treatment option compared to the <b>surgical</b> removal of the prostate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Surgical</b> {{exploration}} may {{be necessary}} to obtain a suitable biopsy and to accurately stage a patient with cholangiocarcinoma. Laparoscopy can be used for staging purposes and may avoid the need for a more invasive <b>surgical</b> procedure, such as laparotomy, in some patients. Surgery is also the only curative option for cholangiocarcinoma, although it is limited to patients with early-stage disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} {{a broad array of}} {{outpatient}} <b>surgical</b> centers, emergency clinics, home health care services, assisted-living facilities and skilled nursing facilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} for ectropion {{varies depending on}} {{the severity of the}} condition. The only {{treatment for}} entropion is <b>surgical,</b> and may be delayed until the dog reaches adulthood as whilst a puppy the facial structures of the animal are still growing and changing. Dogs who have <b>surgical</b> correction for defects such as entropion or ectropion may not be exhibited in the show ring.|$|E
25|$|Throughout history, {{the most}} {{important}} has been the division into <b>surgical</b> and internal medicine specialties. The <b>surgical</b> specialties are the specialties in which {{an important part of}} diagnosis and treatment is achieved through major <b>surgical</b> techniques. The internal medicine specialties are the specialties in which the main diagnosis and treatment is never major surgery. In some countries Anesthesiology is classified as a <b>surgical</b> discipline, since it is vital in the <b>surgical</b> process, though anesthesiologists never perform major surgery themselves.|$|E
25|$|<b>Surgical</b> {{pathology}} is {{the most}} significant and time-consuming area of practice for most anatomical pathologists. <b>Surgical</b> pathology involves the gross and microscopic examination of <b>surgical</b> specimens, as well as biopsies submitted by non-surgeons such as general internists, medical subspecialists, dermatologists, and interventional radiologists. <b>Surgical</b> pathology increasingly requires technologies and skills traditionally associated with clinical pathology such as molecular diagnostics.|$|E
25|$|In healthcare, {{triclosan}} {{is used in}} <b>surgical</b> scrubs {{and hand}} washes. Use in <b>surgical</b> units is effective with a minimum contact time of approximately two minutes. More recently, showering with 2% triclosan has become a recommended regimen in <b>surgical</b> units for the decolonization of patients whose skin carries methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Triclosan is also used in the coatings for some <b>surgical</b> sutures.|$|E

25|$|The Da Vinci <b>Surgical</b> {{system is}} a <b>surgical</b> {{operating}} system approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2002. In April 2004, a robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy was first performed successfully in a Korean patient with localized prostate cancer by the urology team at the Robotic Surgery Center of Dong-A University Hospital in Singapore. Currently, more than 20 Da Vinci Robots are presently in Korea {{for the application of}} various <b>surgical</b> procedures. The system provides dexterous <b>surgical</b> precision with 10-15X magnified 3D images and improves the rate of successful delicate <b>surgical</b> movements when compared with skilled human hands.|$|E
25|$|From 1981 to 1992, {{first as}} a <b>surgical</b> {{assistant}} (SA) {{and then as a}} jointly responsible <b>surgical</b> assistance, he conducted many internships – such as convalescence ward, specialist clinics, operating room (OR)-to students and apprentices at the <b>Surgical</b> Clinic Institute III of the University of Milan, directed by Prof. Walter Montorsi.|$|E
25|$|Choice of <b>surgical</b> {{method and}} {{anesthetic}} technique aims {{to reduce the}} risk of complications, shorten the time needed for recovery and minimise the <b>surgical</b> stress response.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{prevalence}} of elective onychectomy in North America, no standard practices exist regarding the <b>surgical</b> techniques or <b>surgical</b> tools used, the administration of post-operative analgesics or other follow-up care, or the optimal age or other attributes of cats undergoing the procedure. There are three <b>surgical</b> methods: scalpel blade, guillotine trimmers, and laser.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, it was {{estimated}} that on average New Zealand’s <b>surgical</b> costs are around 15 to 20% the cost of the same <b>surgical</b> procedure in the USA.|$|E
25|$|A {{specialized}} growing {{subset of}} interventional MRI is intraoperative MRI, in which doctors use an MRI in surgery. Some specialized MRI systems allow imaging concurrent with the <b>surgical</b> procedure. More typical, however, {{is that the}} <b>surgical</b> procedure is temporarily interrupted so that MRI can verify {{the success of the}} procedure or guide subsequent <b>surgical</b> work.|$|E
25|$|The {{technical}} goal of saline-implant {{technology was}} a physically less invasive <b>surgical</b> technique for emplacing an empty breast implant device through a smaller <b>surgical</b> incision. In <b>surgical</b> praxis, after having emplaced the empty breast implants to the implant pockets, the plastic surgeon then filled each device with saline solution, and, because the required insertion-incisions are short and small, the resultant incision-scars will be smaller and {{shorter than the}} <b>surgical</b> scars usual to the long incisions required for inserting pre-filled, silicone-gel implants.|$|E
25|$|Trigonocephaly {{seems to}} be the most {{compliant}} form of craniosynostosis for surgery. Because of standardization of current <b>surgical</b> approaches there is no <b>surgical</b> mortality and complications are few to none.|$|E
25|$|By {{equipment}} used: Laser surgery involves {{use of a}} laser {{for cutting}} tissue instead of a scalpel or similar <b>surgical</b> instruments. Microsurgery {{involves the use of}} an operating microscope for the surgeon to see small structures. Robotic surgery makes use of a <b>surgical</b> robot, such as the Da Vinci or the Zeus <b>surgical</b> systems, to control the instrumentation {{under the direction of the}} surgeon.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} a tumor is {{determined}} by imaging, by <b>surgical</b> exploration, or by a pathologist after examination of the tissue from a biopsy or a <b>surgical</b> specimen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Surgical</b> {{management}} of acute pulmonary embolism (pulmonary thrombectomy) is uncommon and {{has largely been}} abandoned because of poor long-term outcomes. However, recently, it {{has gone through a}} resurgence with the revision of the <b>surgical</b> technique and is thought to benefit certain people. Chronic pulmonary embolism leading to pulmonary hypertension (known as chronic thromboembolic hypertension) is treated with a <b>surgical</b> procedure known as a pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.|$|E
25|$|Perforated {{peptic ulcer}} is a <b>surgical</b> {{emergency}} and requires <b>surgical</b> repair of the perforation. Most bleeding ulcers require endoscopy urgently {{to stop bleeding}} with cautery, injection, or clipping.|$|E
25|$|RF Electrosurgery is {{commonly}} used in virtually all <b>surgical</b> disciplines including dermatological, gynecological, cardiac, plastic, ocular, spine, ENT, maxillofacial, orthopedic, urological, neuro- and general <b>surgical</b> procedures as well as certain dental procedures.|$|E
25|$|WHO {{has also}} worked on global {{initiatives}} in surgery, including emergency and essential <b>surgical</b> care, trauma care, and safe surgery. The WHO <b>Surgical</b> Safety Checklist is in current use worldwide {{in the effort}} to improve patient safety.|$|E
25|$|DeBakey {{initially}} {{resisted the}} <b>surgical</b> option, but as his health deteriorated and DeBakey became unresponsive, the <b>surgical</b> team opted {{to proceed with}} <b>surgical</b> intervention. In a controversial decision, Houston Methodist Hospital Ethics Committee approved the operation; on February 9–10, he became the oldest patient ever to undergo the surgery {{for which he was}} responsible. The operation lasted seven hours. After a complicated post-operative course that required eight months in the hospital at a cost of over one million dollars, DeBakey was released in September 2006 and returned to good health. Although DeBakey had previously refused surgery, he later stated that he was grateful that his <b>surgical</b> team performed the operation.|$|E
25|$|Aesthetic {{surgery is}} an {{essential}} component of plastic surgery and includes facial and body aesthetic surgery. Plastic surgeons use cosmetic <b>surgical</b> principles in all reconstructive <b>surgical</b> procedures as well as isolated operations to improve overall appearance.|$|E
25|$|The {{rates of}} a <b>surgical</b> wound opening after surgery has {{remained}} constant. When a wound opens after surgery, the hospital stay becomes longer {{and the medical}} care becomes more intensive if a <b>surgical</b> wound opens after surgery.|$|E
25|$|<b>Surgical</b> & Special Care Services {{encompasses}} outpatient surgery, inpatient surgery, a <b>surgical</b> care unit, {{a progressive}} care unit and intensive care. The department has 18 operating rooms, over 100 surgeons, and performs 14,000 operations a year.|$|E
25|$|<b>Surgical</b> {{treatment}} for an ingrown nail {{is carried out}} by a podiatrist, a foot and ankle specialist. This is typically an in-office procedure requiring local anesthesia and special <b>surgical</b> instruments. The <b>surgical</b> approach is {{the removal of the}} offending part of the nail plate known as a wedge resection. If the ingrown toenail recurs despite this treatment, destruction of the sides of the nail with chemicals or excision is done; this is known as a matrixcestomy. Antibiotics may be used after the procedure but are not recommended, as they may delay healing. <b>Surgical</b> {{treatment for}} ingrown nails is more effective at preventing the nail from regrowing inwards compared to non-surgical treatments.|$|E
25|$|If {{bleeding}} {{has already}} occurred, <b>surgical</b> intervention may be necessary. However, whether to pursue <b>surgical</b> intervention is an often difficult decision {{in a stable}} patient with minimal evidence of blood clot on ultrasound.|$|E
