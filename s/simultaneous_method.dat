5000|$|In 1898 he {{published}} {{a book about the}} Poisson distribution, titled The Law of Small Numbers. In this book he first noted that events with low frequency in a large population follow a Poisson distribution even when the probabilities of the events varied. It was that book that made the Prussian horse-kicking data famous. The data gave the number of soldiers killed by being kicked by a horse each year in each of 14 cavalry corps over a 20-year period. Bortkiewicz showed that those numbers followed a Poisson distribution. The book also examined data on child-suicides. Some have suggested that the Poisson distribution should have been named the [...] "Bortkiewicz distribution."In political economy, Bortkiewicz is important for his analysis of Karl Marx's reproduction schema in the last two volumes of Capital. Bortkiewicz identified a transformation problem in Marx's work. Making use of Dmitriev's analysis of Ricardo, Bortkiewicz proved that the data used by Marx was sufficient to calculate the general profit rate and relative prices. Though Marx's transformation procedure was not correct—because it did not calculate prices and profit rate simultaneously, but sequentially—Bortkiewicz has shown {{that it is possible to}} get the correct results using the Marxian framework, i.e. using the marxian variables constant capital and variable capital it is possible to obtain the profit rate and the relative prices in a three-sector model. This [...] "correction of the Marxian system" [...] has been the great contribution of Bortkiewicz to classical and Marxian economics but it was completely unnoticed until Paul Sweezy's 1942 book [...] "Theory of Capitalist Development". Piero Sraffa (1960) has provided the complete generalization of the <b>simultaneous</b> <b>method</b> for classical and Marxian analysis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{confound}} {{that the}} critics of the Illinois study criticized was the following: the Illinois study compared the traditional <b>simultaneous</b> <b>method</b> of lineup presentation with the sequential double-blind method recommended by academics like Gary Wells. The traditional method is not conducted double-blind (meaning that the person presenting the lineup does not know which person or photo is the suspect). The critics claim that the results cannot be compared because one method was not double-blind while the other was double-blind. This criticism {{ignores the fact that}} the mandate of the Illinois legislature was to compare the traditional method with the academic method. More significantly, as an experiment {{to determine whether or not}} sequential double-blind administration would be superior to the simultaneous methods used by most police departments, the Illinois study provides an abundance of useful data which, at this point, seems to show that neither of the methods used in that experiment is superior to the other. What it does not provide is a clear reason why, because the effect of [...] "double-blind" [...] was not tested for the simultaneous lineups.The Innocence Project Lineup studies mentioned here previously were never funded, largely because the expected grant funds were withdrawn in connection with economic difficulties. A separate grant was submitted to the Department of Justice in March 2009 by the independent Urban Institute to study simultaneous/sequential lineups in actual police departments in Connecticut and Washington, D.C. That study had been solicited by DOJ, but was unexpectedly cancelled in August 2009 due to [...] "a low likelihood of success." [...] It is unclear at this time what the DOJ was thinking when they canceled the grant. The Urban Institute is seeking other funding.|$|E

TMZ was entrapped in calcium alginate beads prepared with sodium alginate by the ionotropic gelation method using calcium chloride as a crosslinking agent. The drug was incorporated either into preformed calcium alginate gel beads (sequential method) or incorporated simultaneously during the gelation stage (<b>simultaneous</b> <b>method).</b> The beads were evaluated for particle size and surface morphology using optical microscopy and SEM, respectively.
