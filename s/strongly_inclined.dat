5|$|Four pilosity {{patterns}} (patterns of hair-like setae) {{are known}} to occur within Tatuidris collections. Pilosity pattern A consists of a mix of both long flexuous and short appressed setae. This {{is the most common}} pilosity pattern and the one that most resembles the type specimens from El Salvador and the gyne from Otongachi, Ecuador. Pilosity pattern B is characterized by very short, fully appressed, and regular spaced setae arrayed homogeneously and equidistantly on the head, mesosoma, petiole, postpetiole and gaster. Pilosity pattern C is characterized by dense lanose-looking setae. Pilosity pattern D consists of short and uniform decumbent (<b>strongly</b> <b>inclined</b> but not fully appressed) setae scattered throughout the body.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, Robert Harrington led {{a search}} to {{determine}} the real cause of the apparent irregularities. He calculated that any PlanetX would be at roughly three times the distance of Neptune from the Sun; its orbit would be highly eccentric, and <b>strongly</b> <b>inclined</b> to the ecliptic—the planet's orbit would be at roughly a 32-degree angle from the orbital plane of the other known planets. This hypothesis was met with a mixed reception. Noted PlanetX sceptic Brian G. Marsden of the Minor Planet Center pointed out that these discrepancies were a hundredth the size of those noticed by Le Verrier, and could easily be due to observational error.|$|E

The torso was relatively flat in side view, however, despite the belly being broad, it was not extremely vertically compressed as with ankylosaurs but taller than wide.

5|$|Uranus is {{the seventh}} {{planet of the}} Solar System; it has 27 known moons, {{all of which are}} named after {{characters}} from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. Uranus's moons are divided into three groups: thirteen inner moons, five major moons, and nine irregular moons. The inner moons are small dark bodies that share common properties and origins with Uranus's rings. The five major moons are massive enough to have reached hydrostatic equilibrium, and four of them show signs of internally driven processes such as canyon formation and volcanism on their surfaces. The largest of these five, Titania, is 1,578km in diameter and the eighth-largest moon in the Solar System, and about one-twentieth the mass of the Moon. The orbits of the regular moons are nearly coplanar with Uranus's equator, which is tilted 97.77° to its orbit. Uranus's irregular moons have elliptical and <b>strongly</b> <b>inclined</b> (mostly retrograde) orbits at large distances from the planet.|$|E

40|$|Passion {{is defined}} as a strong {{inclination}} toward an activity that people love and in which they invest time and energy (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 85 [2003] 756 - 767). Whereas various studies investigated the motives that people allege for engaging in sharing emotions, no data exist about motives for sharing passion. As passions have a strong emotional component and as emotions are virtually always socially shared (e. g. Rime, B., Finkenauer, C., Luminet, O., Zech, E., & Philippot, P. (1998). Social Sharing of Emotion: New Evidence and New Questions. In W. Stroebe and M. Hewstone (Eds.), European Review of Social Psychology (Vol. 9., pp. 145 - 189). Chichester: Wiley), we hypothesized that passionate people would <b>strongly</b> <b>incline</b> in sharing their passion with people around them. A first study examined the link between passion and emotion and showed that the more the activity was invested by passion, the more emotions are intense and positive. In a second study, we considered the relations between passion and social sharing and concluded that the social sharing of passion does not result solely from the emotional component of the shared passion. A third study explored alleged motives for sharing passion and revealed that the more the target is amateur, the larger the sharing is. Motives alleged by respondents for sharing their passion varied broadly as a function of target type. Exchange, learning, pleasure and affiliation motivate social sharing with other amateurs; promotion, information and proselytism are the most salient motives for sharing with the non connoisseur; ego-defence, activity justification, interest in other's opinion and proselytism dominate when addressing critic persons.

25|$|In contrast, Jupiter-sized {{bodies that}} orbit {{too close to}} the {{habitable}} zone but not in it (as in 47 Ursae Majoris), or have a highly elliptical orbit that crosses the habitable zone (like 16 Cygni B) make it very difficult for an independent Earth-like planet to exist in the system. See the discussion of a stable habitable zone above. However, during the process of migrating into a habitable zone, a Jupiter-size planet may capture a terrestrial planet as a moon. Even if such a planet is initially loosely bound and following a <b>strongly</b> <b>inclined</b> orbit, gravitational interactions with the star can stabilize the new moon into a close, circular orbit that is coplanar with the planet's orbit around the star.|$|E

Life is still regulated from the Mosque. Out of seventy-two squabbling sects, the Deobandi Sunni Sect (orthodox Hanafi school of Islamic Jurisprudence) is predominant on the whole, with Tablighi jamaat as their preacher. This religious organization is of inert conviction, a non-political wing of the Deobandi school of thought, and a counterweight to the ulema. Hardly a household has missed consuming some amount of time with this Jamat. They stress the value of rituals and outward imitation of the prophet.

6000|$|The Papacy was a {{necessary}} part of Dante's system, as a supplement to the Empire, which we <b>strongly</b> <b>incline</b> to believe was always foremost in his mind. In a passage already quoted, he says that [...] "the soil where Rome sits is worthy beyond what men preach and admit," [...] that is, as the birthplace of the Empire. Both in the Convito and the De Monarchia he affirms that the course of Roman history was providentially guided from the first. Rome was founded in the same year that brought into the world David, ancestor of the Redeemer after the flesh. St. Augustine said that [...] "God showed in the most opulent and illustrious Empire of the Romans how much the civil virtues might avail even without true religion, that it might be understood how, this added, men became citizens of another city whose king is truth, whose law charity, and whose measure eternity." [...] Dante goes further than this. He makes the Romans as well as the Jews a chosen people, the one as founders of civil society, the other as depositaries of the true faith.[213] One side of Dante's mind was so practical and positive, and his pride in the Romans so intense,[214] that he sometimes seems to regard their mission as the higher of the two. Without peace which only good government could give, mankind could not arrive at the highest virtue, whether of the active or contemplative life. [...] "And since what is true of the part is true of the whole, and it happens in the particular man that by sitting quietly he is perfected in prudence and wisdom, {{it is clear that the}} human race in the quiet or tranquillity of peace is most freely and easily disposed for its proper work which is almost divine, as it is written, 'Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels'[215] Whence it is manifest that universal peace is the best of those things which are ordained for our beatitude.
