40|$|We {{show how}} to {{construct}} <b>semi-invariants</b> and integrals {{of the full}} symmetric sl(n) Toda lattice for all n. Using the Toda equations for the Lax eigenvector matrix we prove the existence of <b>semi-invariants</b> which are homogeneous coordinates in the corresponding projective spaces. Then we use these <b>semi-invariants</b> to construct the integrals. The existence of additional integrals which constitute {{a full set of}} independent non-involutive integrals was known but the chopping and Kostant procedures have crucial computational complexities already for low-rank Lax matrices and are practically not applicable for higher ranks. Our new approach solves this problem and results in simple explicit formulae for the full set of independent <b>semi-invariants</b> and integrals expressed in terms of the Lax matrix and its eigenvectors, and of eigenvalue matrices for the full symmetric sl(n) Toda lattice.

40|$|In 1773 Laplace {{obtained}} {{two fundamental}} <b>semi-invariants,</b> called Laplace invariants, for scalar linear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) in two independent variables. He utilized {{this in his}} integration theory for such equations. Recently, Tsaousi and Sophocleous studied <b>semi-invariants</b> for systems of two linear hyperbolic PDEs in two independent variables. Separately, by splitting a complex scalar ordinary differential equation (ODE) into its real and imaginary parts PDEs for two functions of two variables were obtained and their symmetry structure studied. In this work we revisit <b>semi-invariants</b> under equivalence transformations of the dependent variables for systems of two linear hyperbolic PDEs in two independent variables when such systems correspond to scalar complex linear hyperbolic equations in two independent variables, using the above-mentioned splitting procedure. The <b>semi-invariants</b> under linear changes of the dependent variables deduced for this class of hyperbolic linear systems correspond to the complex <b>semi-invariants</b> of the complex scalar linear (1 + 1) hyperbolic equation. We show that the adjoint factorization corresponds precisely to the complex splitting.

While most T cell subsets have TCRs that recognize peptide or lipid-based antigens in association with MHC or CD1, MAIT cells are unique in that they recognize small molecules created {{through the process of}} vitamin B2 (riboflavin) and B9 (folic acid) biosynthesis. The vitamin B2 related molecules that activate MAIT cells are chemically unstable, and undergo spontaneous degradation in water, although they have now been successfully chemically synthesised and isolated. Riboflavin and folic acid are both crucial components of the metabolic pathways in bacteria. When MR1 is associates with these small molecules and becomes expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, MAIT cell TCRs then bind to MR1, leading to MAIT cell activation, clonal expansion, memory, and an array of antimicrobial responses.|$|E
