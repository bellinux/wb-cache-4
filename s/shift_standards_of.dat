40|$|We {{present a}} {{bijective}} {{proof of the}} hook-length formula for <b>shifted</b> <b>standard</b> tableaux <b>of</b> a fixed shape based on a modified jeu de taquin and {{the ideas of the}} bijective proof of the hook-length formula for ordinary standard tableaux by Novelli, Pak and Stoyanovskii. In their proof Novelli, Pak and Stoyanovskii define a bijection between arbitrary fillings of the Ferrers diagram with the integers $ 1, 2, [...] .,n$ and pairs <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> tableaux and hook tabloids. In our shifted version of their algorithm the map from the set of arbitrary fillings of the shifted Ferrers diagram onto the set <b>of</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>standard</b> tableaux is analog to the construction of Novelli, Pak and Stoyanovskii, however, unlike to their algorithm, we are forced to use the 'rowwise' total order of the cells in the shifted Ferrers diagram rather than the 'columnwise' total order as the underlying order in the algorithm. Unfortunately the construction of the shifted hook tabloid is more complicated in the shifted case. As a side-result we obtain a simple random algorithm for generating <b>shifted</b> <b>standard</b> tableaux <b>of</b> a given shape, which produces every such tableau equally likely.

The social-role interpretation of such findings is challenged from the shifting-standards perspective, which suggests that the application <b>of</b> within-sex judgmental <b>standards</b> to men and women in roles may have masked underlying gender stereotypes (Biernat, 2003). To clarify this issue, 256 participants judged an average man or woman portrayed as an employee, homemaker, or without role information on agentic and communal traits.

40|$|A Thesis Submitted In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements For the Degree of Master of Science - Psychology Cognitive and Affective ScienceCollege student-athletes are {{susceptible}} to a unique stereotype threat known as the "dumb jock" stereotype, according to which student-athletes are supposedly less engaged in academics and less competent academically. Previous {{research has shown that}} people do harbor the "dumb jock" stereotype, which negatively affects student-athletes' perceived academic self-regard and academic performance. In the present research, I test whether a <b>shifting</b> in <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> academic competence may be the mechanism underlying the negative effect of stereotype threat on student-athletes' perceived academic self-regard and academic performance. A <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> academic competence is defined as the criterion people set on an academic task {{in order for them to}} call themselves academically competent. Stereotype threat was manipulated and participants'standards of academic competency, perceived academic self-regard, and academic performance were measured. It was predicted that student-athletes who take a math test that they perceive as being diagnostic of typical academic performance would perform worse academically and have lower perceived academic self-regard than student-athletes who perceive the test as non-diagnostic of typical academic performance and non-athlete students who perceive the test as diagnostic of academic performance. Also, it was predicted that student-athletes who perceive the test as diagnostic of typical academic performance would <b>shift</b> their <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> academic competence downwards (i. e., require less evidence of competence for themselves) to reduce the likelihood of confirming the "dumb jock" stereotype, which would lead to poorer academic performance and to lower perceived academic self-regard. However, contrary to the predictions, the participants in the test diagnostic/student-athlete condition had significantly higher math test accuracy scores than the test diagnostic/non-athlete student condition. These results suggest that the "dumb jock" stereotype threat may be less threatening than previous research has suggested. Possible explanations for the enhanced performance and perceived academic self-regard are discussed. One potential explanation is stereotype reactance - the motivated tendency to behave in a manner inconsistent with an imposed stereotype about the group to which the person belongs. This interpretation is described in detail and new avenues of research on the "dumb jock" stereotype threat are discussed...|$|R
