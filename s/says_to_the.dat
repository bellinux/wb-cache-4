5|$|Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) overhears Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) confessing to {{the camera}} that he is {{having an affair with}} Angela's (Angela Kinsey) husband Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman). Oscar makes Kevin promise not to reveal anything. During the day, Angela {{constantly}} makes unconscious double entendres and foreshadowing, sorely tempting Kevin to let out what he knows. Afraid that Kevin cannot keep his secret, Oscar tries to frame Kevin so that Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) will have him fired, but confesses to Toby that he lied. Later, Robert visits the office, and Oscar acts unnaturally nervous around him. Before Angela's suspicions can be aroused, Kevin interrupts to cheer Robert on about his upcoming election. Oscar <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camera that he is proud of how Kevin kept the secret, but Kevin then reveals that he momentarily forgot all about the secret, and begins to laugh uncontrollably.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} his father took all the family money and fled to Argentina with his mistress. Left {{to pick up the}} pieces, Andy sells off family heirlooms, and is upset that he has to sell the family boat for lack of any other means for his mother to support herself. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) convinces him that before he sells the boat, they should take it out for one last sunset cruise, and they drive to Stamford, Connecticut, where the boat is docked. Andy starts to hoist the main sail, but is stopped by a broker who is to sail it to the Caribbean for the buyer. With Erin's encouragement, Andy decides to take the boat to the Caribbean himself. He then finds his drunken brother Walter (Josh Groban) passed out in the liquor closet. Walter comes to and tells Andy he wanted to get the first relapse out of the way before {{checking}} into rehab. Andy invites him on the trip, saying they both need family time together and leaves, thanking Erin for her encouragement. Erin <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camera that she would have loved to go with him if he asked. Back in the office that evening, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) asks Erin to join him for drinks, and she accepts.|$|E
25|$|The film {{suggests}} Scotland {{had been}} under English occupation for some time, at least during Wallace’s childhood, and {{in the run-up to}} the Battle of Falkirk Wallace <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> younger Bruce, “e'll have what none of us have ever had before, a country of our own.” In fact Scotland had been invaded by England only the year before Wallace's rebellion; prior to the death of King Alexander III it had been a fully separate kingdom.|$|E

25|$|In his defence at trial, Socrates must refute {{two sets}} of accusations: (i) asebeia (impiety) against the pantheon of Athens, by {{introducing}} new gods; and (ii) corruption of Athenian youth, by teaching them to doubt the status quo. Socrates <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> court that these old accusations arise from years of gossip and prejudice against him; hence, are matters difficult to address. He then embarrasses the accusing Orators, by reformulating their diffuse accusations against him into proper, legal form, that: “Socrates is committing an injustice, in that he inquires into things below the earth and in the sky; and makes the weaker argument the stronger; and teaches others to follow his example” (19b-c).|$|E
25|$|The {{novel was}} adapted by MGM in 1964 {{as the film}} Murder Most Foul. However, in an unusual move, the {{character}} of Poirot was replaced with Christie's other most famous detective Miss Marple (portrayed by Margaret Rutherford), who comes onto the case when she is a juror {{in the trial of}} the lodger who is accused of the murder. As she is the only juror to believe the lodger is innocent and will not join with the others to vote guilty the jury foreman <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> judge that they cannot make up their minds. The judge rules for a mistrial and arranges for a retrial for a week's time, giving Miss Marple seven days to solve the case.|$|E
25|$|Éomer and his riders make {{a stop at}} Eaworth while {{returning}} to Edoras. The Third Marshall <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> player the same thing he earlier said to Aragorn: that his riders have killed the Uruks and burned their bodies, with none left alive. The player and his/her two companions set out to investigate {{the site of the}} battle nonetheless. Lacking Aragorn's superior tracking skills, they miss the signs of the Hobbits having escaped and nearly succumb to despair. However, a chance encounter with an Ent from Fangorn reveals that not only are the Hobbits alive, but that Gandalf himself has already seen for their safety. Their hopes renewed, the player, Horn and Corudan the Elf decide to travel with Eomer's eored for a time.|$|E

500|$|Earlier in the episode, Homer and June Bellamy {{attend an}} in-store {{appearance}} {{as part of}} the promotion for the new character Poochie. They are asked a question of internal consistency, like the show's fans do all the time; Homer <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fan who asks the question, [...] "Why would a man whose shirt says 'Genius at Work' spend all his time watching a children's cartoon show?"

500|$|The Iron Giant {{primarily}} {{deals with}} the concept of existentialism, as well as the nature of humanity. This is exemplified when Hogarth <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Giant [...] "You are who you choose to be". McCanlies commented that [...] "At a certain point, there are deciding moments when we pick who we want to be. And that plays out {{for the rest of your}} life." [...] McCanlies added that films can provide viewers with a sense of right and wrong, and expressed a wish that The Iron Giant would [...] "make us feel like we're all part of humanity [...] is something we need to feel." [...] When some critics compared the film to [...] (1982), Bird responded by saying [...] "E.T. doesn't go kicking ass. He doesn't make the Army pay. Certainly you risk having your hip credentials taken away if you want to evoke anything sad or genuinely heartfelt." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to come to a}} decision, Lois and Peter decide to visit the local {{family-planning}} center, and ultimately decide to abort the embryo. However, as Peter exits the center he encounters an anti-abortion rally, where he is shown an anti-abortion video by one of the protesters. The video causes him to reconsider about aborting the unborn baby. Returning home, Lois continues to advocate her right to choose, while Peter now attempts to argue the unborn child's right to life and whether Lois has the responsibility of carrying it to term. At their wits' end, the two decide to discuss the matter, once and for all. The next day, Lois talks with the family about [...] "the wonderful new member of the Griffin family", but then, after a few seconds of silence, Peter turns to the camera and <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience [...] "We had the abortion", promptly ending the episode.|$|E
500|$|Michael begins {{leaving the}} office early, refusing to explain {{himself to his}} {{employees}} and lying to Jan of his whereabouts. In reality, Michael has been combating heavy debt by working as a telemarketer until 1 a.m. At the office the next day, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) arrives to find Michael unprepared for a presentation due to his moonlighting, and orders Michael to quit his night job or be fired from Dunder Mifflin. At the same time, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) flaunts {{the fact that she}} is now dating Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) in an attempt to make Ryan jealous. They get into a fight later where Kelly <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> documentary crew, [...] "Darryl Philbin is the most complicated man I have ever met. I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking? What kind of game is that?" [...] After quitting his telemarketing job, Michael desperately attempts to come up with money.|$|E

500|$|The Dream Lord {{describes}} the Doctor sarcastically as [...] "The Oncoming Storm", a name coined by his archenemies the Daleks, and first {{mentioned in the}} Seventh Doctor novel Love and War and subsequently on-screen in [...] "The Parting of the Ways", where it was attributed to the Daleks. He also <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Doctor, [...] "You're probably a vegetarian!" [...] in a butcher's shop and calls him [...] "veggie", referring to The Two Doctors, in which the Sixth Doctor announced that he and Peri would eat a vegetarian diet from then on. The Dream Lord also teases the Doctor's relationship with Elizabeth I. This began in [...] "The Shakespeare Code" [...] where Elizabeth I wished to behead the Doctor and continued in The End of Time, which alluded to the possibility the two were married. The marriage between the two was seen 3 years later in [...] "The Day of the Doctor".|$|E
500|$|At the lighthouse, Mr. Briscoe {{decides to}} brave the storm in a landing craft, but is {{immediately}} swamped {{with water and}} carried by the tide towards the mainland. After Castro avails himself of {{the services of a}} prostitute, he rampages around the property searching for Picasso. The storm crashes through the inn. A guest is killed by a billiards table that falls on top of him and is dragged off into the sea. Mr. Glowery is also dragged off into the sea by the storm. Castro and his assistant round up the guests and interrogate them about the location of the $1.5 million Picasso stole. In another part of the inn a fire starts. Finally, Mr. Briscoe shows up and kills Castro's assistant before knocking Castro unconscious. While Hawthorne learns his wife is leaving him for the prostitute, the inn becomes completely engulfed in flames. Picasso, Hawthorne, and Briscoe motor a lobster boat over to the lighthouse, and dump Castro's dead assistant into the sea along with Castro himself, weighed down with two cinder blocks chained to his ankles. When they land on the island, Briscoe runs into the lighthouse and blows himself up. Amongst the rubble of the lighthouse, Picasso notices the inscription [...] "MORTE D'AUTHOR" [...] painted on one of the surrounding rocks and <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> innkeeper [...] "He's been thinking about this for some time, George." ...|$|E
500|$|Homer takes Bart's sons to a {{cryonics}} {{facility where}} Grampa has been frozen alive {{to prevent a}} disease from killing him. Although a cure has now been discovered, he is kept frozen by Homer because it is cheaper than paying for a nursing home and because Grampa has constantly been rude to him. Homer <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boys that they should give their father another chance, since he knows Bart loves them. At that point, Bart arrives and apologizes to his sons, admitting how much he treasures them. Touched, the two boys forgive him for not having included them [...] in his life much, while an inspired Homer decides to unfreeze Grampa and forgive him as well. Meanwhile, Lisa goes into the Ultranet to find Zia and discovers a door leading into Zia's private world. Entering it, Lisa is overjoyed to find that Zia has hung a poster of her next {{to a series of}} posters depicting historical women who have made a difference in the world. When Zia arrives, Lisa thanks her for looking up to her and the two reconcile at last, and secretly hides her life as a party poser. With the conflicts resolved, Bart and Lisa gather their children in preparation for a new Christmas family photo. Marge arrives with Maggie, who has given birth to a baby girl. The Simpsons gather into a group just as the family pets (who have evolved greatly over the past thirty years) take the new photo.|$|E

500|$|The final segment, [...] "It's the Grand Pumpkin, Milhouse" [...] is {{a parody}} of It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (and was {{supposed}} to be named [...] "It's The Great Pumpkin, Milhouse," [...] but due to legal reasons, was renamed) and contains several references to the Peanuts series. In the segment, Milhouse wears the same clothes and plays the same role as Linus van Pelt. Lisa is modelled after Sally Brown and Bart looks like Charlie Brown; he even says [...] "good grief", echoing Charlie Brown's catchphrase. The main theme to Peanuts [...] "Linus and Lucy" [...] is played several times. A redesigned version of Santa's Little Helper can be seen sleeping on top of his dog house and Homer is seen sleeping on top of his house {{in a manner similar to}} Snoopy. When Marge first speaks, she uses a muted trombone. This is {{a parody of}} the [...] "wah wah wah" [...] voice that is used for adults in the various Peanuts specials. At the end of the segment, she <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience that they can send complaints to an address which she only says in more muted trombone noises. Milhouse' prayer to the Grand Pumpkin is similar to the Nicene Creed. The dance scene during the Halloween party is a parody of the dance scene in A Charlie Brown Christmas right down to Kang and Kodos in a nonspeaking cameo as the twins 3 and 4.|$|E
500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{comes into}} the office, wearing shabby clothing, and walks {{straight}} into manager Nellie Bertram's (Catherine Tate) office and pleads for a job. She eventually caves and makes him janitor for the day. Later, Andy says in a talking head interview that he has actually convinced former CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) to buy Dunder Mifflin from Sabre and then make him the regional manager yet again; Andy is wearing the shabby clothing and making himself smell of alcohol {{in order to make}} everyone believe that he is doing poorly. [...] Andy becomes very dependent on David arriving at the office until Andy calls him to say that he cannot make it until the next Friday. Andy then announces the plan and upon hearing this everyone assumes that Andy's conversations with David are hallucinations because none of them have seen Andy talking with David. However, David surprisingly shows up to the office and assures everyone that he is indeed buying Dunder Mifflin from Sabre with the $20 million that he got from selling a toy-vacuum invention to the United States Military. He also reveals that Jo Bennett is planning on liquidating the rest of Sabre. Upon hearing this news, Sabre CEO Robert California (James Spader) approaches David in an oddly excitable tone, introducing himself as [...] "Bob Kazamakis" [...] and takes him to the conference room to negotiate. Meanwhile, when Andy is reinstated as manager, Nellie begs him by reciting Shakespeare's quality of mercy quote from The Merchant of Venice. Out of pity, Andy gives Nellie a new job as special projects manager. Robert later tells the office that he will be leaving {{for the next three years}} and going to [...] "help" [...] undereducated Eastern European high school gymnasts with matching funds of one million dollars, which he convinces David to donate, disgusting the rest of the office. He then exits the office once and for all by giving Andy a kiss, possibly as a symbol of his power being regained, puts his arm around Andy and <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> office, [...] "It's been a great year." ...|$|E
