The major source of innovation and renewal in <b>business</b> <b>services</b> is regarded to be knowledge/competencies/intangible assets. We identify four competencies in <b>business</b> <b>services</b> firms that potentially can drive innovation; customer competence, organizational competence, market and network competence and ICT competence. In order to align these competencies to <b>business</b> <b>services,</b> we develop a <b>business</b> <b>service</b> typology by arguing that degree of standardization and degree of client interaction in the service delivery process are the major categories for distinguishing <b>business</b> <b>services.</b> Based {{on a combination of}} these categories, four generic types of <b>business</b> <b>services</b> are identified: expert <b>business</b> <b>services,</b> client <b>business</b> <b>service,</b> special <b>business</b> <b>services,</b> and standard <b>business</b> <b>services.</b> Informed by the service innovation research and case examples from <b>business</b> <b>service</b> firms, we link the four <b>business</b> <b>service</b> types to innovation drivers (competencies types) and suggest a busines...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{first and}} second {{articles}} in the trilogy introduced shared <b>services</b> as a <b>business</b> model and the various models through which a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> can and must evolve to create value. The purpose of this third and final article in the trilogy of articles is to identify the key success factors required to successfully manage a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> unit. Methodology: A comprehensive literature {{study was conducted in}} order to identify the key success factors required to successfully manage a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> unit. This was followed up with an empirical study to determine if organisations that have implemented shared <b>services</b> as a <b>business</b> model are using any of these identified factors to successfully manage their respective shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> units. Findings: In the article, a framework is generated to help organisations understand the key success factors required to successfully manage a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> unit. This work has further potential in that the key factors required can also be used not only in the normal brick and mortar organisations, but also in virtual organisations. Implications: This article presents a comprehensive approach to understand the key success factors required to manage a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> unit. These findings are important as they can be applied to a conventional organisation as well as a virtual organisation. Value: This article provides an understanding of the key success factors required to manage a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> model. When these key success factors are used as a basis for the management of a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> unit, it will continuously create value for the organisation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Now that an {{organisation}} {{understands the}} concept of shared services (Article 1), it needs to implement shared <b>services</b> as a <b>business</b> model. The purpose of this second article in the trilogy is to describe the phases during the implementation process, {{as well as the}} various models through which a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> unit will evolve to continuously add value to the organisation. Methodology: A comprehensive literature study was conducted in order to: - Determine the steps in implementing a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> model, - Determine the various models associated with a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> unit, - Determine how the continuous evolution of shared services results in moving from one shared services model to the next shared services model. Findings: In this article, a framework is generated to help organisations understand the various phases and steps it needs to go through to successfully implement a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> unit. This work has further potential: when applied correctly, organisations will provide a business environment where effectiveness and efficiency is a given. Implications: This article presents the context for organisations to implement a shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> model and to continuously evolve from one shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> model to the other to create value for the organisation. The findings are important for organisations that {{are in the process of}} implementing or have implemented shared services, as they can easily stagnate and fall into the trap of centralisation. Value: This article provides an understanding of what is required for the successful implementation of shared services. This value is further enhanced through continuous evolution from a basic shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> model to the virtual shared <b>services</b> <b>business</b> model and beyond. </p...|$|R

Finally, the law identifies the rights of the worker to days off and the responsibility of the office to return the worker within three months of arrival in Lebanon in case the workers refuse to work, escaped from their working place or in case of pregnancy; the law gives more specifics on the duties of the office with regards to the working states of the workers in Lebanon. Other measurements taken by the government of Lebanon includes adding more regulations to the process of bringing foreign workers into the country. The measurements apply on workers from the state of Madagascar, where no office is allowed to bring workers from Madagascar without the approval of the consulate of Madagascar in Lebanon.
