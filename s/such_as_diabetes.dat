5|$|Genetic {{modification}} of animals to study disease. Transgenic animals have specific genes inserted, modified or removed, to mimic specific {{conditions such as}} single gene disorders, such as Huntington's disease. Other models mimic complex, multifactorial diseases with genetic components, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>diabetes,</b> or even transgenic mice that carry the same mutations that occur during the development of cancer. These models allow investigations on {{how and why the}} disease develops, as well as providing ways to develop and test new treatments. The vast majority of these transgenic models of human disease are lines of mice, the mammalian species in which genetic modification is most efficient. Smaller numbers of other animals are also used, including rats, pigs, sheep, fish, birds, and amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{disease is}} more common in babies and young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it {{is more common}} in children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>diabetes</b> and asthma.|$|E

5|$|Specific {{genes that}} have been linked with MS include {{differences}} in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system—a group of genes on chromosome 6 {{that serves as the}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC). That changes in the HLA region are related to susceptibility has been known since the 1980s, and additionally this same region has been implicated in the development of other autoimmune diseases <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>diabetes</b> type I and systemic lupus erythematosus. The most consistent finding is the association between multiple sclerosis and alleles of the MHC defined as DR15 and DQ6. Other loci have shown a protective effect, such as HLA-C554 and HLA-DRB1*11. Overall, {{it has been estimated that}} HLA changes account for between 20 and 60% of the genetic predisposition. Modern genetic methods (genome-wide association studies) have discovered at least twelve other genes outside the HLA locus that modestly increase the probability of MS.|$|E
