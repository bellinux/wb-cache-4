A <b>safety</b> <b>report</b> has been worked out of three selected installations with high hazardous impact. It was based on detailed notes of two briefing seminars held at a big Ukrainian chemical industry complex. The <b>safety</b> <b>report</b> is only available in Russian. Measures were recommended to increase safety of installations. The Skeleton <b>Safety</b> <b>Report</b> represents an abridged and anonymous version of the <b>safety</b> <b>report</b> with additional instructions on methods. The Skeleton <b>Safety</b> <b>Report</b> contains recommendations on safety management systems, general description of location and installations, technical design and processing of selected installations, hazard identification and risk assessment, measures to prevent and mitigate hazardous incidents. Short-, medium- and long-term measures are named to eliminate deficits. A catalogue of demands has been compiled on safety equipment and measures for the selected installations. (orig.)

A qualitative study identifying influences on incident and <b>safety</b> risk <b>reporting</b> in NHS Trusts???, poster presented at Health Services Research UK, Nottingham, UK, 13 - 14 July, 2016. Patient <b>safety</b> <b>reporting</b> was introduced nationally as a patient safety improvement tool {{more than a decade}} ago (DOH, 2002), but there has been little evidence of impact in the interim (eg Shojiana, 2008). ?? Studies of patient <b>safety</b> <b>reporting</b> commonly investigate an aspect of risk or incident reporting shown to be critical in other sectors in order to comment on relative performance in healthcare. Such studies have identified barriers to patient <b>safety</b> <b>reporting</b> including: lack of shared vision for reporting, a lack of management support, poor feedback, system design, user-friendliness, and level of information required. Identifying improvements required for <b>safety</b> <b>reporting</b> in healthcare based on its deficits compared to other sector successes has been criticised (eg comparing culture in healthcare with culture in aviation; Macrae, 2015). The aim of this study was to identify where improvements can be made to the process of patient <b>safety</b> and risk <b>reporting,</b> based on NHS staff descriptions of identification and reporting and their experience of where the challenges lie...|$|R
