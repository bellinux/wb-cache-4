5|$|The {{meaning of}} the word law in Article 9(1) has a direct bearing on the scope of the Article. If law is read broadly (for example, as {{incorporating}} customary international law principles), the scope of the fundamental liberties would be wider.

5|$|The {{roots of}} the {{collapse}} of the monarchy can be traced as far back as 1850, upon the death of Pedro II's youngest male child. From that point onward, the Emperor ceased to believe in the monarchy as a viable form of government for Brazil's future, as his remaining heir was a daughter. Although constitutionally permitted, a female ruler was considered unacceptable by both Pedro II and the ruling circles.

Though no bill was put before it, the committee heard from the ANA delegates, discussed the matter, and favored the use of the silver dollar, which as a large coin had the most room for an artistic design.

The War of the Ragamuffins took far longer to put down than had previous rebellions, but through careful negotiation and military victories, Caxias finally managed to pacify the province. The end of the armed conflict was declared on 1 March 1845. He was made a permanent field marshal on 25 March, and raised to the rank of count on 2 April. Caxias ran for a Senate seat, and being among the three candidates with the most votes, he was selected by the Emperor in late 1845 as the senator representing Rio Grande do Sul.

5|$|In {{his first}} year in office, Clarke {{established}} good order in the colony. Unlike Osborn, who treated Colenso's presence at the trials in 1888 as an affront, Clarke took up Colenso's cause and recommended to the Colonial Office in London that Dinuzulu and his uncles be allowed to return from exile, having been sufficiently punished for his supposed offences. Clarke, persuaded by Colenso, argued that Dinuzulu would not cause further trouble <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> policy of fomenting intertribal strife were discontinued and Dinuzulu be appointed induna.

Their departure was set for February 1895 but was delayed after Ministers in London recommended that Zululand first be annexed to Natal.|$|E
5|$|Panpsychism is {{the view}} that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of {{experience}} or point of view.

McAdoo was a major contender, but he was Wilson's son-in-law, and refused to consider a nomination <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> president wanted it. Many at the convention voted for McAdoo anyway, and a deadlock ensued with Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer. On the 44thballot, the Democrats nominated Governor Cox for president, with his running mate Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. As Cox was, when not in politics, a newspaper owner and editor, this placed two Ohio editors against {{each other for the}} presidency, and some complained there was no real political choice.

5|$|Before {{the bonus}} round begins, the winning {{contestant}} chooses {{one of three}} categories {{for his or her}} puzzle (prior to season 35, the puzzle and category were predetermined).

He or she is then shown a puzzle in the chosen category, and every instance of R, S, T, L, N, and E is revealed.

5|$|Matching, also {{referred}} to as “cost sharing”, is a requirement for the recipient to provide contributions or donations (usually non-federal) of a specified amount or percentage to supplement federal assistance received. In other words, when the recipient participates in a federal program (e.g. it receives federal assistance) and an operating budget is prepared, the federal government may require the recipient to provide contributions to cover a portion of that program’s operations. The matching requirement is based on the assertion that total program expenses are 100% and that, although the federal government provides assistance for most of those expenses, the recipient must still cover a portion of them. Such proportion is solely decided by the federal government, but usually the recipient decides how that contribution is provided and to which expenses, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> contribution is verifiable, generally does not originate from another federal program, and is considered in the operating budget. The expenses must be necessary and reasonable, allowed under cost principles (see B section above), and not used for another federal program. Matching may be in the form of contributing the recipient’s own funds or money to suffrage program allowable costs (e.g., paying program utility bills, paying part of program personnel payroll, etc.) or, in some cases, in the form of in-kind contributions, which are donations of non-monetary objects such as services, materials, property, etc.|$|E
