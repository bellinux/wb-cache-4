40|$|This article {{presents}} some new experimental data for study the shielding effect of electromagnetic wave. The frequencies of electromagnetic wave are mainly focused on emission of daily electrical equipments, which are normally called “low frequency electromagnetic waves”. In this work, a water pump with maximum magnetic field intensity of ca. 2300 mG was applied as emission {{source of the}} electromagnetic wave. Experimental measurements used various shielding materials with the major constituent iron (Fe) {{in the form of}} <b>plate</b> for studying <b>shielding</b> effect of electromagnetic wave. The studied parameters were different thicknesses and gaps of the plate. The results show that pure iron plate has the best effect for shielding the magnetic field and its transmission ratio of magnetic field is proportional to distance between the emission source and the <b>shielding</b> <b>plate.</b> Moreover, the <b>shielding</b> <b>plate</b> close to the emission source received better protection...|$|R

50|$|The Sigerson <b>Shield</b> <b>Plate</b> {{competition}} {{was introduced in}} 1976/77 for the teams beaten in the quarter-finals of the Sigerson Cup, in essence to provide competition for the losing teams over the three-day Sigerson weekend. Trinity College Dublin (Dublin University) were the inaugural winners at Fahy Field, Galway. As {{a consequence of the}} Sigerson Cup function at the Dublin University Boat Club, Islandbridge, in February 1990 which descended into an 'orgy of destruction', the CAO decided to scrap the three-day finals weekend format to avoid any recurrence of such chaotic behaviour. In 1990/91 the multi-game weekend format was replaced with all the games being played at separate venues. In 1991/92, the quarter-finals were run off separately from the semi-finals and final, the latter being played over a two-day Sigerson weekend; the same format was used in 1992/93. From 1993/94 the final stages of both the Sigerson and Trench Cups were staged over the same weekend. In 1992/93 the Sigerson Shield was contested between the losing semi-finalists, University College Galway and the University of Ulster at Jordanstown.|$|E

Judging by the research results, the influence of shield thickness is insignificant if the thickness is less than the length of a sound wave. A thick <b>shield</b> <b>plate</b> or a wide shield has two edges, and this increases noise reduction at the expense of double diffraction. Solution of flat monochromatic wave diffraction has been analyzed. The compact formula of sound insulation at uniform field in front of the shield has been obtained...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study a {{three-dimensional}} model has been developed to study shielding gas in a laser welding process using computational fluid dynamics. Laser heating of titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V was done by imposing a volumetric laser heat source. The model was implemented in the open source software OpenFOAM and applied to {{the investigation of the}} shielding gas behaviour over the base metal. Three different cases regarding the outlet shape of the shielding pipe were studied. In some laser welding processes a <b>shielding</b> <b>plate</b> is used to help protecting the welded area. The plate injects the additional shielding gas screen during the welding process. This plate is also considered in the modelling as the fourth case. The influence of the shape of the pipe outlet is discussed. The simulation results confirmed that the <b>shielding</b> <b>plate</b> can protect the welded area by covering the welding path with shielding gas. However, the simulation showed that the shielding gas leaving the plate flows towards the keyhole. It can thus bring some fumes over the keyhole which is not desired since it can make it difficult to track the welding with optical method...|$|R
60|$|There was thus, {{as far as}} arrows went, {{no reason}} why Mycenaean <b>shields</b> should be <b>plated</b> with bronze. If the piece of wood in Grave V. was a shield, as seems probable, what has become of its bronze plates, if it had any? [Footnote: Schuchardt, p. 269] Gold ornaments, which could only belong to shields, [Footnote: Ibid., p. 237.] were found, but bronze <b>shield</b> <b>plates</b> never. The {{inference}} is certain. The Mycenaean shields of the prime were originally wooden or leather defences against stone-headed arrows. Homer's shields are bronze-plated shields to keep out bronze- headed or even, perhaps, iron-pointed arrows of primitive construction (IV. 123). Homer describes armour based on Mycenaean lines but developed and advanced as the means of attack improved.|$|R

The purpose of the process-level models developed in this report is to model dry oxidation, general corrosion, and localized corrosion of the drip <b>shield</b> <b>plate</b> material, which is made of Ti Grade 7. This document is prepared according to ''Technical Work Plan For: Regulatory Integration Modeling and Analysis of the Waste Form and Waste Package'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 171583]). The models developed in this report are used by the waste package degradation analyses for TSPA-LA and serve as a basis to determine the performance of the drip shield. The drip shield may suffer from other forms of failure such as the hydrogen induced cracking (HIC) or stress corrosion cracking (SCC), or both. Stress corrosion cracking of the drip shield material is discussed in ''Stress Corrosion Cracking of the Drip Shield, the Waste Package Outer Barrier, and the Stainless Steel Structural Material'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 169985]).

40|$|The Irradiation Test Vehicle (ITV) was {{installed}} in the Department of Energy’s Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) during May 1999. The ITV is capable of providing neutron spectral tailoring and individual temperature control for up to 15 experiment capsules simultaneously.

The bores of these in-pile tubes are kept dry and test trains with integral instrumentation are inserted and removed through a transfer <b>shield</b> <b>plate</b> above the reactor vessel head. The test vehicle is designed to irradiate specimens as large as 2. 2 cm in diameter, at temperatures of 250 - 800 C, achieving neutron damage rates as high as 10 displacements per atom per year in Vanadium. The experiment specimen temperature control is fully automated using a Distributed Control System (DCS) to control up to 15 separate blended gas channels for the ITV.

30|$|A {{unit of the}} {{electrostatic}} fluxmeter type is used at the observatory. The PG {{is transformed}} into electric current by a rotary electrostatic generator, in which the basis of operation involves the electrostatic induction phenomenon. The electrostatic induction current of the measured field induces an electric charge on the measuring plate. The modulator and <b>shielding</b> <b>plate</b> periodically <b>shields</b> the measuring <b>plate</b> in the electric field, and as a result, the value of induced charge periodically changes. Inflowing and outflowing charge from the plate creates current in a load circuit. The amplitude of this current {{is proportional to the}} strength of the measured electric field, modulation plate rotation frequency, and measuring plate square. The phase is determined by the electric field direction and by the surface of the measuring plate.|$|R

40|$|The AP 600 passive {{containment}} vessel {{is surrounded by}} a concrete cylindrical shell covered with a truncated conical roof. This roof supports the passive containment cooling system (PCS) annular tank, <b>shield</b> <b>plate</b> and other nonstructural attachments. When the shield building is subjected to different loading combinations as defined in the Standard Review Plan (SRP), some of the sections in the shield building could experience forces in excess of their design values. This report summarized the three-dimensional finite element analysis that was conducted to review the adequacy of the proposed Westinghouse shield building design. The ANSYS finite element software was utilized to analyze the Shield Building Roof (SBR) under dead, snow, wind, thermal and seismic loadings. A three-dimensional model that included a portion of the shield building cylindrical shell, the conical roof and its attachments, the eccentricities at the cone-cylinder connection and at the compression ring and the PCS tank was developed. Mesh sensitivity studies were conducted to select appropriate element size in the cylinder, cone, near air intakes and {{in the vicinity of the}} eccentricities. Also, a study was carried out to correctly idealize the water-structure interaction in the PCS tank. Response spectrum analysis was used to calculate the internal forces at different sections in the SBR under Safe Shutdown Earthquake (SSE). Forty-nine structural modes and twenty sloshing modes were used. Two horizontal components of the SSE together with a vertical component were used. Modal stress resultants were combined taking into account the effects of closely spaced modes. The three earthquake directions were combined by the Square Root of the Sum Squares method. Two load combinations were studied. The load combination that included dead, snow, fluid, thermal and seismic loads was selected to be the most critical. Interaction diagrams for critical sections were developed and used to check the design adequacy. The results demonstrated that provided area of steal on each face of several sections of the AP 600 SBR was inadequate. This was also noticed when comparing the total provided area of steel per section, i. e., the area of steel on both faces. The discrepancy between Westinghouse results and these reported herein could have resulted from the different finite element mesh sizes and the assumption used in Westinghouse design...|$|E
40|$|The Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) will {{be placed}} in an orbit that will subject it to {{constant}} solar radiation during its planned 10 -year mission. A sunshield {{will be necessary to}} passively cool the telescope, protecting it from the Sun s energy and assuring proper operating temperatures for the telescope s instruments. This sunshield will be composed of metalized polymer multilayer insulation with an outer polymer membrane (12 to 25 mm in thickness) that will be metalized on the back to assure maximum reflectance of sunlight. The sunshield must maintain mechanical integrity and optical properties for the full 10 years. This durability requirement is most challenging for the outermost, constantly solar-facing polymer membrane of the sunshield. One of the potential threats to the membrane material s durability is from vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation in wavelengths below 200 nm. Such radiation can be absorbed in the bulk of these thin polymer membrane materials and degrade the polymer s optical and mechanical properties. So that a suitable membrane material can be selected that demonstrates durability to solar VUV radiation, ground-based testing of candidate materials must be conducted to simulate the total 10 - year VUV exposure expected during the Next Generation Space Telescope mission. The Steady State Vacuum Ultraviolet exposure facility was designed and fabricated at the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field to provide unattended 24 -hr exposure of candidate materials to VUV radiation of 3 to 5 times the Sun s intensity in the wavelength range of 115 to 200 nm. The facility s chamber, which maintains a pressure of approximately 5 10 (exp - 6) torr, is divided into three individual exposure cells, each with a separate VUV source and sample-positioning mechanism. The three test cells are separated by a water-cooled copper <b>shield</b> <b>plate</b> assembly to minimize thermal effects from adjacent test cells. Part of the interior sample positioning mechanism of one test cell is shown in the illustration. Of primary concern in VUV exposure is the maintenance of constant measured radiation intensity so that the sample s total exposure can be determined in equivalent Sun hours. This is {{complicated by the fact that}} a VUV lamp s intensity degrades over time, necessitating a decrease in the distance between the test samples and the lamp. The facility overcomes this challenge by periodically measuring the lamp s intensity with a cesium-iodide phototube and adjusting the sample distance as required to maintain constant exposure intensity. Sample positioning and periodic phototube location under the lamp are both achieved by a single lead-screw assembly. The lamps can be isolated from the main vacuum chamber for cleaning or replacement so that samples are not exposed to the atmosphere during a test...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} a thermal spray route for making superhydrophobic surfaces with mechanically robust and easy-repairable performances. Cone-like geometry with multi-scale topographical structures was firstly achieved by plasma spray deposition of titania using {{stainless steel mesh}} as <b>shielding</b> <b>plate,</b> then polytetrafluoroethylene/nano-copper composites were deposited by suspension flame spray onto the patterned titania coating. The coatings exhibit superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 153 and a sliding angle of 2. Unlike the surfaces with normal structure, the coatings with multiple length-scale structure retain the superhydrophobicity even after severe mechanical abrasion. The superhydrophobicity can be further easily restored after it is damaged by abrasion. The thermal spray construction of superhydrophobic surfaces proposed in this research offers the advantages of precisely tailoring the surface textures and surface chemistry cost-efficiently over as large an area as desired, showing bright prospects for versatile applications.
