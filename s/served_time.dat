40|$|Interviews were {{conducted}} with 11 Canadian federally sentenced women to explore the process of returning to society after incarceration. Three interrelated categories of experience emerged: <b>serving</b> <b>time</b> in prison; meeting basic needs; and <b>serving</b> <b>time</b> in the community. Respondents made long-term use of resources that were available when <b>serving</b> <b>time</b> inside but also indicated lasting pains of incarceration. Upon release, meeting basic needs relating to health, income, housing, and relationships was exceptionally difficult for many women. <b>Serving</b> <b>time</b> in the community, despite some benefit, was mostly characterized {{by a lack of}} support and excessive surveillance and demands. Overall, respondents demonstrated resourcefulness after prison, but the problems they experienced posed major barriers largely beyond their control. Using a feminist lens, emphasis is placed on the need to address the inequitable social and material conditions that contribute to many women’s criminalization and that are often intensified by the pains of release...|$|R
