25|$|The soy {{carbohydrates}} in tempeh {{become more}} digestible {{as a result}} of the fermentation process. In particular, the oligosaccharides associated with gas and indigestion are greatly reduced by the Rhizopus culture. In traditional tempeh-making shops, the <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> often contains beneficial bacteria that produce vitamins such as B12 (though it is uncertain whether this B12 is always present and bioavailable). In western countries, it is more common to use a pure culture containing only Rhizopus oligosporus, which makes very little B12 and could be missing Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which have been shown to produce significant levels of B12 analogs in tempeh when present. Whether these analogs are true, bioavailable B12, has not been thoroughly studied yet.|$|E

25|$|After {{the grapes}} destined for Vin Santo are {{harvested}} in September or October, they {{are laid out}} on straw mats, often under rafters or staircases. They are kept in warm, well ventilated rooms that allow the moisture in the grape to evaporate. This process of desiccation allows the sugars in the grape to be more concentrated. The longer the grapes are allowed to dry and desiccate, the higher the resulting residual sugar levels {{will be in the}} wine. Depending on the style of wine desired, the grapes may be crushed and the fermentation process started after a few weeks or not till late March.

40|$|Probiotics, {{especially}} Lactobacillus acidophilus, strains {{have increasingly}} {{been incorporated into}} food products as dietary adjuncts due to their purported health benefits. Dairy products, especially yogurt, are frequently used as probiotic delivery systems. To realize therapeutic effects, {{it is important to}} consume a high amount of probiotics. However, maintaining a sufficient amount of viable probiotics in yogurt throughout the shelf life has been a challenge as <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> have shown to possess some deleterious effects on probiotic survival. The main objective of this thesis project was {{to determine the extent of}} antagonistic effects imposed by yogurt <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) and their metabolic products on the survival of five different L. acidophilus strains designated as ATCC 700396, LA- 5, NCFM, PIM 703 and SBT 2062. These probiotic strains were incorporated as adjuncts in yogurts, which were made with and without <b>starter</b> <b>cultures.</b> To simulate pH reduction in regular yogurt, yogurt without <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> was manufactured by adding an acidulant (glucono-delta-lactone). The pH of both yogurts was approximately 4. 6 throughout the 28 -day storage period at 4 °C. Viable cell counts of the probiotic strains were enumerated weekly on a selective medium (MRS-maltose agar). While cell count of L. acidophilus PIM 703 and SBT 2062 remained steady (6 x 107 CFU/g) in yogurt with <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> during storage period, the survival of ATCC 700396 and NCFM was reduced significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) by 3 log and 4. 6 log, respectively. In contrast, in yogurt without <b>starter</b> <b>cultures,</b> all L. acidophilus strains survived well with a maximum of 1 -log reduction. Our results indicated that while the presence of <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> (especially L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) had a negative effect on the survival of some probiotic strains, low pH was not an important factor impairing their viable cell counts. In addition to survival studies, gene expression of selected stress genes (dnaK and groEL) was determined using semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. This preliminary study demonstrated the important of dnaK in L. acidophilus NCFM to maintain its viability under various stress in yogurt during refrigerated storage period. These studies underscore the selection criteria of probiotic strains in fermented food should include their abilities to coexist with the <b>starter</b> <b>cultures.</b> Our future work is to provide a better understanding of strain differences in survival of probiotics in yogurt...|$|R
40|$|Ting is a cooked {{fermented}} sorghum {{food that}} is popular amongst southern Africans for its sour taste and unique flavour. However, major challenges {{are associated with}} large-scale production and marketing of this spontaneously fermented food due to inconsistent microbiological and sensory quality. The use of <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> may circumvent these limitations. Prior to engaging <b>starter</b> <b>cultures,</b> detailed knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics during fermentation is important. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate microbial diversity and dynamics during sorghum fermentations, and to clarify the role of <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> regarding the microbiological safety and consumer acceptance of sensory characteristics of fermented ting. A culture-independent approach, based on the use of PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), revealed that Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus curvatus, Weissella cibaria and some Enterobacteriaceae were predominant at the end of spontaneous sorghum fermentations. Culture-dependent methods indicated that Lb. fermentum, Lb. plantarum, Lb. rhamnosus, E. faecalis, E. mundtii, W. cibaria and L. lactis were predominant at the end of fermentation. These results not only indicated the predominant bacteria during sorghum fermentation, but also indicated that a combined approach is required to reveal microbial diversity and dynamics during spontaneous sorghum fermentations. Based on the above results, L. lactis, Lb. fermentum, Lb. plantarum and Lb. rhamnosus were evaluated as <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> for production of ting. All the <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> were able to ferment sorghum, but the lowest pH and highest lactic acid was produced in naturally fermented sorghum inoculated with L. lactis. This fermentation showed an increase in the number of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts, whilst pathogen counts decreased.

The results indicated that the use of L. lactis in <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> may result in ting with consistent and acceptable attributes. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.
