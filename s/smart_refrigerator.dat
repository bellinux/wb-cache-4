50|$|Internet {{refrigerator}} (also {{known as}} a <b>smart</b> <b>refrigerator)</b> is a refrigerator which has been programmed to sense what kinds of products are being stored inside it and keep a track of the stock through barcode or RFID scanning. This kind of refrigerator is often equipped to determine itself whenever a food item needs to be replenished.|$|E
50|$|After the {{incident}} with the exploding Hooli phones, Jack Barker intends to replace all 9 million affected devices instead of releasing a firmware update. This puts Pied Piper in risk of breaching contract with FGI, as {{the cell phone}} network where the data is stored will be eliminated. Richard decides to use 'Anton', Pied Piper's server, to store the data, even if this will exceed its capacity and probably destroy it. Barker heads to China and tries to force the Hooli plant workers to increase production, but he is taken hostage until their demands are met. Gavin Belson, in Tibet, learns about this through Erlich and heads to China, rescues Barker and leaves him in Jackson Hole before being reinstated as Hooli's CEO. Meanwhile, after the broadband service at the incubator is cut {{due to lack of}} payment, Richard plans to connect Anton to Stanford Tech's mainframe, using Big Head's position there to do so. When they arrive, they discover that {{the back of the truck}} wasn't closed and Anton's parts have been scattered all over the road. When they head to FGI to face Melcher, the team finds that Anton had backed itself up to Jian-Yang's <b>smart</b> <b>refrigerator,</b> as Gilfoyle used some of the Pied Piper code when he was trying to hack it, which in turn connected itself to a network of other refrigerators like it, distributing the data and proving the decentralized internet is a working concept. Melcher attacks Richard, as he finally found out he had sex with his fiancée. Gavin Belson offers a very generous acquisition deal to Richard, who turns it down and decides to be funded by Bream-Hall. Gavin threatens to devour Pied Piper, but Richard answers back, promising to render the entire mainframe business, and Hooli itself, obsolete.|$|E

30|$|With the {{development}} of internet of things (IoT), smart home appliances have been released. For instance, all home appliances for living, such as <b>smart</b> TVs, <b>smart</b> <b>refrigerators,</b> <b>smart</b> washers, and smart cooling and heating devices, have come to get connected to internet and make people’s lives convenient. These days, the smart home service capable of integrating and managing the devices has globally developed. The smart home service is like a personal household based on automation. It has the system of controlling {{the internal and external}} factors of a house, such as lighting, temperature, doors, and windows. The smart home service is able to set lighting, temperature, music, and TV programs differently depending on whether a person is at home and a user’s experience and preference [1 – 3].|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{interesting}} about RFID sensor tag technology which can obtain {{information on the}} external environment to smart card is increasing worldwide. In case of sensor tag, most of sensor tag has been developed as resistive type sensor tags. Resistive type humidity sensor requires temperature revision as the influence of temperature and there are special environment to detect low humidity of 15 % or less. To solve this problem, circuit was composed that capacitive sensor is interlocked to resistive type sensor tag. The composed circuit is a capacitive humidity sensor which is connected to resistive sensor tags. Using the CVC circuit, capacitive humidity sensor change is output voltage. The output voltage connects with resistive sensor tag. Implemented system's sensor value storage or real time monitoring experiment result was able to determine the usefulness. Also, developed humidity sensor tag {{is applied to the}} <b>smart</b> <b>refrigerator...</b>|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate what effect was made on the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, intention to use and self efficacy about use of <b>smart</b> <b>refrigerator</b> when visual information related to the food and function is provided in advance in the interface. A data was collected from a between-subjects experiment (N = 26) with an independent variable (priming visual information vs. non-priming). According to the experiment results, users who were primed about the visual cues perceived higher usefulness (PU), ease of use (PEoU), intention to use (IU), and self-efficacy (SE) toward the fridge compared to the users in a non-primed group. The study proposes theoretical and practical implications for designing food-related smart home appliances’ interface and visual affordances...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} testbed for {{exploring}} novel <b>smart</b> <b>refrigerator</b> interactions, and identify three key adoption-limiting interaction shortcomings of state-of-the-art smart fridges: lack of 1) user experience focus, 2) low-intrusion object recognition and 2) automatic item position detection. Our testbed system addresses these limitations {{by a combination}} of sensors, software filters, architectural components and a RESTful API to track interaction events in real-time, and retrieve current state and historical data to learn patterns and recommend user actions. We evaluate the accuracy and overhead of our system in a realistic interaction flow. The accuracy was measured to 83 - 88 % and the overhead compared to a representative state-of-the-art barcode scanner improved by 27 %. We also showcase two applications built on top of our testbed, one for finding expired items and ingredients of dishes; and one to monitor your health. The pattern that these applications {{have in common is that}} they cast the interaction as an item-recommendation problem triggered when the user takes something out. Our testbed could help reveal further user-experience centric interaction patterns and new classes of applications for smart fridges that inherently, by relying on our testbed primitives, mitigate the issues with existing approaches...|$|E
30|$|Since {{the end of}} 2000, {{smartphones}} have explosively {{spread and}} have made people’s lives plentiful. With the start of smartphones, new smart devices, including tablet PCs, <b>smart</b> TVs, <b>smart</b> <b>refrigerators,</b> and <b>smart</b> air conditioners, have emerged, expanding their areas from individuals to business and home. These days, smart home service has drawn {{a lot of attention}} as a human-centric service. It is the environment where home appliances and other smart devices are connected to internet in order for user service and experience. The current smart home service is simply based on wireless home network to execute the function of connected home. The service has no smart home security so that it is possible for users to suffer a financial loss caused by information leakage or home appliance hacking. Therefore, to apply smart home service to surroundings, it is necessary to take into account security of smart devices. In this paper, we propose an enhanced security framework for smart devices in a smart home environment. The security framework provides the integrity system using the self-signing and access control techniques for preventing the security threats such as data modification, leakage and code fabrication.|$|R
50|$|Georgia Institute of Technology has {{developed}} a smart house. This house would help to address issues older adults face when living alone, such as physical and mental decline as well as awareness for family members. The house includes technology such as pendants which understand commands {{in the form of}} hand gestures. It could open and lock doors, close blinds, turn on lights, and more. There is also an in-home monitoring system that can inform family members about an older relative’s daily activities, health status, and potential problems. This would allow older adults to remain in their own home while still maintaining their independence without their families having to worry about their well being. This is not the only smart house that has popped up.The University of Florida has created one as well. It has <b>smart</b> <b>refrigerators</b> and pantries which can detect food consumption and expired products. Their smart laundry machines can coordinate with the smart closet to notify the resident when it is time to do laundry as well as aid in sorting the laundry. Every room is specially designed with these and many more smart features to aid their living situation.|$|R

Especially, the integration of mobile networking technology and intelligent mobile devices has made it possible to develop the advanced mobile distance learning system that supports portable smart devices such as smartphones and tablets for the future IT environment. We present a synchronous mobile learning system that enables both instructor and student to participate in distance learning with their tablets. When an instructor gives a lecture using a tablet with front-face camera by bringing up slides and making annotations on them, students in the distance can watch the instructor and those slides with annotation on their own tablets in real time. A student can also ask a question or have a discussion together using the text chat feature of the system during a learning session. We also show the user evaluation of the system.

40|$|Abstract. RFID tags are tiny, inexpensive, inductively powered {{computers}} {{that are going}} to replace bar codes on many products, but which have many other uses as well. For example, they will allow smart washing machines to check for incompatible clothes (e. g., white shirts and red socks) and <b>smart</b> <b>refrigerators</b> to check for milk that is too old to be consumed. Subdermal tags with medical information are already being implanted in animals and people. However, a world in which practically everything is tagged and can be read at a modest distance by anyone who wants to buy an RFID reader introduces serious security and privacy issues. For example, women walking down the street may be effectively broadcasting the sizes of their RFID-tagged bras and medical data without realizing it. To protect people in this environment, we propose developing a compact, portable, electronic device called an RFID Guardian, which people can carry with them. In the future, it could be integrated into PDAs or cell phones. The RFID Guardian looks for, records, and displays all RFID tags and scans in the vicinity, manages RFID keys, authenticates nearby RFID readers, and blocks attempted accesses to the user’s RFID tags from unauthorized readers. In this way, people can find out what RFID activity is occuring around them and take corrective action if need be. ...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{ubiquitous}} computing has been rapidly emerged {{in our lives}} and extensive {{studies have been conducted}} in a variety of areas related to smart devices, such as tablets, smartphones, <b>smart</b> TVs, <b>smart</b> <b>refrigerators,</b> and <b>smart</b> media devices, as a measure for realizing the {{ubiquitous computing}}. In particular, smartphones have significantly evolved from the traditional feature phones. Increasingly higher-end smartphone models that can perform a range of functions are now available. Smart devices have become widely popular since they provide high efficiency and great convenience for not only private daily activities but also business endeavors. Rapid advancements have been achieved in smart device technologies to improve the end users’ convenience. Consequently, many people increasingly rely on smart devices to store their valuable and important data. With this increasing dependence, an important aspect that must be addressed is security issues. Leaking of private information or sensitive business data due to loss or theft of smart devices could result in exorbitant damage. To mitigate these security threats, basic embedded locking features are provided in smart devices. However, these locking features are vulnerable. In this paper, an original security-locking scheme using a rhythm-based locking system (RLS) is proposed to overcome the existing security problems of smart devices. RLS is a user-authenticated system that addresses vulnerability issues in the existing locking features and provides secure confidentiality in addition to convenience...|$|R

40|$|The term Big Data {{has become}} {{pervasive}} {{in recent years}} as smart phones, televisions, washing machines, <b>refrigerators,</b> <b>smart</b> meters, diverse sensors, eyeglasses and even clothes connect to the Internet. However, their generated data is worthless without information retrieval through data analytics. As Big Data is too big for a single person to investigate, appropriate technologies are being used. Unfortunately, there is not one solution but a large variety of different tools, each of them with other functionalities, properties and characteristics. Especially small and midsized companies have a hard time to keep track as this requires time, skills, money, and specific knowledge which result in high entrance barriers for Big Data utilization. This papers aims to reduce these barriers by explaining and structuring different classes of technologies and basic criteria for proper technology selection. It proposes a framework that guides especially small and mid-sized companies through a suitable selection process that can serve as a basis for further advances...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{us would}} agree that Information Technology has been {{evolving}} at an amazing pace, giving us more innovations in the past one decade {{than it did in}} an entire century before. No aspect of human life today has been left untouched by this revolution. Personal computers, fax machines, pagers, and cell phones in the hands of millions of people worldwide have led to the evolution of a completely “Connected or Wired Society ” realizing the metaphor Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam. With the advent of wireless internet, <b>smart</b> homes, <b>refrigerators</b> that talk to the internet, pace makers that contact the emergency services in case of a stroke, one can’t but opt for the hyperbole to describe these seemingly magical innovations that have left precious little to our imagination. In a subtler vein however, almost as an ode to Charles Darwin, this journey has not always been a story of evolution. It is replete with instances where the De Novo of yesterdays have failed to find even a fleeting mention in the daily diaries of today. This has increasingly saddled us with generations of hardware and software systems that are completely incompatible with each other. It is almost paradoxical that larger the capital investment required for these systems faster is the obliteration rate. This problem assumes added dimensions for organizations that are preparing for their first serious round of computerization or planning to integrate their hitherto isolated systems.

40|$|Sensors {{are present}} in various forms {{all around the world}} such as mobile phones, {{surveillance}} cameras, <b>smart</b> televisions, intelligent <b>refrigerators</b> and blood pressure monitors. Usually, most of the sensors are a part of some other system with similar sensors that compose a network. One of such networks is composed of millions of sensors connect to the Internet which is called Internet of things (IoT). With the advances in wireless communication technologies, multimedia sensors and their networks are expected to be major components in IoT. Many studies have already been done on wireless multimedia sensor networks in diverse domains like fire detection, city surveillance, early warning systems, etc. All those applications position sensor nodes and collect their data for a long time period with real-time data flow, which is considered as big data. Big data may be structured or unstructured and needs to be stored for further processing and analyzing. Analyzing multimedia big data is a challenging task requiring a high-level modeling to efficiently extract valuable information/knowledge from data. In this study, we propose a big database model based on graph database model for handling data generated by wireless multimedia sensor networks. We introduce a simulator to generate synthetic data and store and query big data using graph model as a big database. For this purpose, we evaluate the well-known graph-based NoSQL databases, Neo 4 j and OrientDB, and a relational database, MySQL. We have run a number of query experiments on our implemented simulator to show that which database system(s) for surveillance in wireless multimedia sensor networks is efficient and scalable...|$|R
