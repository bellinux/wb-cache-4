5000|$|Certain {{physical}} conditions {{may make it}} impossible for a woman to conceive. This is called [...] "involuntary infecundity." [...] If the woman has a condition making it possible, but unlikely to conceive, this is termed [...] "subfecundity." [...] Venereal diseases (especially gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia) are common causes. Nutrition is a factor as well: women with less than 20% body fat may be subfecund, a factor of concern for athletes and people susceptible to anorexia. Demographer Ruth Frisch has argued that [...] "It takes 50,000 calories to make a baby". There is also <b>subfecundity</b> in the weeks following childbirth, and this can be prolonged {{for a year or more}} through breastfeeding. A furious political debate raged in the 1980s over the ethics of baby food companies marketing infant formula in developing countries. A large industry has developed to deal with <b>subfecundity</b> in women and men. An equally large industry has emerged to provide contraceptive devices designed to prevent conception. Their effectiveness in use varies. On average, 85% of married couples using no contraception will have a pregnancy in one year. The rate drops to the 20% range when using withdrawal, vaginal sponges, or spermicides. (This assumes the partners never forget to use the contraceptive.) The rate drops to only 2 or 3% when using the pill or an IUD, and drops to near 0% for implants and 0% for tubal ligation (sterilization) of the woman, or a vasectomy for the man.|$|E

In 1978, {{a national survey}} of 1,049 married {{women between the ages of}} 68 and 78 were interviewed between the months of March and July in order to investigate low fertility during the 1920s and 1930s and the women of childbearing age during those decades. In addition to the general purpose, the study was designed to gather information to test specific hypotheses concerning demographic and socioeconomic differentials in fertility, the prevalence of contraceptive practice and the methods employed, the extent to which <b>subfecundity</b> and sterility may have contributed to low fertility, and the timing patterns and childbearing pace of the time. The interview collected information on each respondent's family planning, contraception usage, pregnancy history, fecundity, infertility, fertility, and maternal and infant health. Besides demographic characteristics and background information about the respondents, information was also gathered on their household composition, their husband(s), marriages, and areas of residency.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} long working hours and shift work on time to pregnancy. METHODS: Cross sectional samples with retrospective data collection from two 700 bed hospitals at secondary to tertiary care level in Hatyai district, Songkhla Province, Thailand. The study was conducted from March 1995 to November 1995 among 1496 pregnant women attending the antenatal clinics. <b>Subfecundity</b> was defined as time to pregnancy longer than 7. 8, 9. 5, or 12 months (time to pregnancy was calculated from the date at which the couples started having sexual relations without any contraception until last menstrual date). RESULTS: The descriptive analyses were restricted to 1201 planned pregnancies and the analytical part to 907 working women. Separate analyses on primigravid women were also done. Logistic regressions adjusted for age, education, body mass index, menstrual regularity, obstetric and medical history, coital frequency, and potential exposure to reproductive toxic agents, showed an odds ratio (OR) associated with female exposure to long working hours of 2. 3 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 0 to 5. 1) in primigravid and 1. 6 (1. 0 to 2. 7) in all pregnant women. Male exposure to long working hours and shiftwork showed no association with <b>subfecundity.</b> The OR of <b>subfecundity</b> was highest when both partners worked > 70 hours a week irrespective of the cut off point used (OR 4. 1 (95 % CI 1. 3 to 13. 4) in primigravid women; OR 2. 0 (95 % CI 1. 1 to 3. 8) in all pregnant women).

40|$|A {{random sample}} {{of women in the}} midwestern United States was studied in order to provide a fuller picture {{of the ways in which}} US women responded to <b>subfecundity.</b> Using a {{biomedical}} definition of infertility, we examined women who did not conceive within 12 months of unprotected intercourse whether they were trying to get pregnant or not. Of the 196 ever-subfecund women in our sample, 123 experienced <b>subfecundity</b> while trying to get pregnant; we called these “subfecund with intent. ” Another 73 women experienced <b>subfecundity</b> while not actively trying to get pregnant; we called these “subfecund without intent. ” Of the 196 subfecund women, 39 % reported having sought treatment. Treatment-seekers had clearer intentions to get pregnant, were more likely to seek infertility information on their own, and were more likely to self-define as having fertility problems. Those with more income, more education and lower internal locus of control were more likely to seek medical help. Among the subfecund with intent who pursued medical help, about a fourth had received treatment. The few women who had sought spiritual counseling or non-conventional help often combined these actions with medical help-seeking. This study supported the conclusion that common-sense understandings among subfecund women play an important role in help-seeking behavior. From a practical point of view, there is a large unmet need for infertility services and infertility counseling in the United States...|$|E

METHODS: Data {{were drawn from}} a population-based cross-sectional study, the European Study of Infertility and <b>Subfecundity.</b> Interviews were conducted with 6630 women aged 25 to 44 years.

40|$|Although {{it is well}} {{accepted}} that egg quality decreases with advanced maternal age, {{we do not know}} how it is affected at the earliest ages during the pubertal transition—likely because this young population is not typically reproducing. However, in the setting of fertility preservation, more childhood cancer patients are surviving their diagnosis due to medical advances, forcing patients and their families to consider their future fertility at a very young age. Ex vivo in vitro maturation, in which cumulus oocyte complexes harvested from ovarian tissue are cultured to obtain mature gametes, is gaining traction as a fertility preservation method that is coupled to ovarian tissue cryopreservation. This method is particularly suitable for prepubertal and young adolescent girls, although live births have not yet been reported in gametes derived from females during the pubertal transition. Importantly, the period immediately following menarche in primate species (non-human primate and human) is characterized by relative <b>subfecundity</b> or sterility, and data from agricultural species and humans suggest that this may in part be due to increased chromosomal abnormalities in the egg.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{elucidate}} possible {{effects on}} fecundability from chemical, biological, and physical agents in laboratories, a retrospective study {{based on a}} questionnaire was conducted among female personnel who worked in Swedish biomedical research laboratories. Female personnel in non-laboratory departments were used as a reference group. The maximum number of women included in the analyses was 560.  This corresponded to 2519  menstrual cycles. These women had given birth at least once during the period 1990 - 4.  METHODS—Time to pregnancy was used to estimate the fecundability—that is, probability of conception of a clinically detectable pregnancy per cycle. The fecundability ratio (FR) between exposed and unexposed cycles was calculated with a discrete time analogue of the Cox's proportional-hazards model. The FR estimates below unity indicate <b>subfecundity.</b>  RESULTS—Work with organic solvents in general in laboratory work, gave a decreased adjusted fecundability ratio (FR) of 0. 79  (95 % confidence interval (95  % CI) 0. 68  to 0. 93).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent studies {{indicate}} that not only women’s but also men’s obesity has adverse effects on fecun-dity and since fecundity is a couple concept, we examined fecundity in relation to overweight and obesity of the couple. We also examined the association between weight changes and fecundity over time. METHODS: Between 1996 and 2002, 64 167 pregnant women enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort were interviewed during and 18 months after pregnancy. Information on body mass index (BMI) and waiting time to pregnancy (TTP) was available for 47 835 couples. RESULTS: Among {{men and women with}} a BMI of 18. 5 kg/m 2 or more, we found a dose-response relationship between increasing BMI group and <b>subfecundity</b> (a TTP of more than 12 months) : Odds ratio (OR) 5 1. 32 (95 % CI: 1. 26 – 1. 37) for women and OR 5 1. 19 (95 % CI: 1. 14 – 1. 24) for men. Among 2374 women with an initial BMI of 18. 5 kg/m 2 or more, who participated more than once in the Danish National Birth Cohort, each kilogram increment in weight between the two pregnancies was associated with a 2. 84 (95 % CI: 1. 33 – 4. 35) days longer TTP.

40|$|Fertility is {{a couple}} concept that has been {{measured}} {{since the beginning of}} demography, and male fecundity (his biological capacity to reproduce) is a component of the fertility rate. Unfortunately, {{we have no way of}} measuring the male component directly, although several indirect markers can be used. Population registers can be used to monitor the proportion of childless couples, couples who receive donor semen, trends in dizygotic twinning, and infertility diagnoses. Studies using time-to-pregnancy (TTP) may identify couple <b>subfecundity,</b> and TTP data will correlate with sperm quality and quantity as well as sexual activity and a number of other conditions. Having exposure data available for couples with a fecund female partner would make TTP studies of interest in identifying exposures that may affect male fecundity. Biological indicators such as sperm quality and quantity isolate the male component of fertility, and semen data therefore remain an important source of information for research. Unfortunately, often over half of those invited to provide a sperm sample will refuse, and the study is then subject to a selection that may introduce bias.

Pregnancy history (number of births, age at each birth) was restricted to births before the first scleroderma-related hospitalization for cases and the corresponding age for their matched controls.

Nulliparity was associated with an increased risk of scleroderma (odds ratio = 1. 37, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 22, 1. 55). Risk decreased with increasing number of births. Similar results were found when analyses were limited to births up to 2 years or up to 5 years before hospitalization.

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about {{reproductive}} health in severely obese women. In this study, we present associations between different levels of severe obesity and {{a wide range of}} health outcomes in the mother and child. Methods: From the Danish National Birth Cohort, we obtained self-reported information about prepregnant body mass index (BMI) for 2451 severely obese women and 2450 randomly selected women from the remaining cohort who served as a comparison group. Information about maternal and infant outcomes was also self-reported or came from registers. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between different levels of severe obesity and reproductive outcomes. Principal Findings: <b>Subfecundity</b> was more frequent in severely obese women, and during pregnancy, they had an excess risk of urinary tract infections, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders which increased with severity of obesity. They tended to have a higher risk of both pre- and post-term birth, and risk of cesarean and instrumental deliveries increased across obesity categories. After birth, severely obese women more often failed to initiate or sustain breastfeeding. Risk of weight retention 1. 5 years after birth was similar to that of other women, but after adjustment for gestational weight gain, the risk was increased, especially in women in the lowest obesity category.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Several {{conditions}} apparent at birth, e. g., neural tube defects (NTDs) and cardiac anomalies, {{are associated}} with polymorphisms in folate-related genes, such as the 677 C [...] > T polymorphism of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. Similar associations have been established for several constitutional chronic diseases in adulthood, such as schizophrenia, cardiovascular diseases, dementia, and even neoplasias in different organ systems. This spectrum of developmental anomalies and constitutional diseases {{may be linked to}} high-risk conceptions related to preovulatory overripeness ovopathy (PrOO). Some developmental anomalies, such as NTDs, are to a large extent prevented by supplementation of folic acid before conception, but supplementation does not seem to prevent cardiovascular disease or cognitive decline. These diverging results can be elucidated by introduction of the PrOO concept, as MTHFR polymorphisms and inherent low folate levels induce both non-optimal maturation of the oocyte and unsuccessful DNA methylation and demethylation, i. e. epigenetic mutations. The PrOO concept is testable and predicts in a random population the following: (1) female carriers of specific genetic MTHFR variants exhibit more ovulatory disturbances and inherent <b>subfecundity</b> traits, (2) descendents from a carrier mother, when compared with those from a wild-type mother, are more frequently conceived in PrOO high-risk conditions and, thus, (3) disadvantaged in life expectancy. If so, some MTHFR polymorphisms represent a novel, genetically determined, PrOO high-risk conception category comparable to those which are environmentally and behaviorly influenced. These high-risk conditions may cause developmental anomalies and defective epigenetic reprogramming in progeny. The interaction between genetic and environmental factors is a plausible mechanism of multifactorial inheritance...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about time trends in {{fecundity}} because few population-based data are available. In a survey among female twins born from 1953 to 1976, their time to pregnancy {{did not differ from}} singletons and can be considered to represent the fecundity of the general population. METHODS: Information was collected by interview about waiting time to first pregnancy (TTP) and any periods of <b>subfecundity</b> among both male and female twins born between 1931 and 1952. Trends were analysed by considering the year of birth of the index per-son (birth cohort effect) or year at which the first attempt started (period effect). RESULTS: Eighty-five percent of male and 81. 3 % of female eligible twins participated. A total of 1598 male twins and 1653 female twins reported a TTP value and 1671 men and 1715 women had a value for their first attempt to conceive including unsuccessful attempts. No overall trends in either male or female TTP were observed with increasing year of birth or of starting time, after adjustment for confounders, but for attempts fecundity increased among female twins by year of birth or of starting the attempt. A decreasing risk of severe infertility with increasing year of birth or year for start of the attempt was observed among male twins, but this observation was based on only 81 men and was not seen among female twins. CONCLUSION: No decreasing trend in fecundity was observed among Danish twins born between 1931 and 1952 who had completed their reproduction. Female twins had a slight increase in fecundity, and men a decrease in severe infertility. In addition, TTP was apparently well reported and recalled for up to 5...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{association}} between a woman’s own birthweight and her fecundity has been suggested, but no empirical data {{have been published}} on the {{association between}} maternal birthweight and waiting time to pregnancy (TTP). METHODS: In the Danish National Birth Cohort (1996 – 2002), which is an ongoing study of 92 274 women and their pregnancies, information about TTP and prepregnancy BMI was collected during pregnancy. At the 7 -year follow-up of the children, 21 786 mothers reported their own birthweight and whether they were born at term or preterm. The association between maternal birthweight and TTP is presented as adjusted odds ratios with 95 % con-fidence intervals. RESULTS: Low maternal birthweight (2500 g for term and 1500 g for preterm birth) was {{associated with an increased}} risk of TTP of> 1 year [term: 1. 2 (1. 0 – 1. 5); preterm: 1. 8 (1. 1 – 3. 1) ].

The effects of BMI on their gonadotrophin levels (day 2 LH, FSH), gonadotrophin dose required for ovarian stimulation, endometrial thickness and oocyte/embryo quality were looked at, after correcting for age and poor ovarian reserve. Materials and Methods : Retrospective study of medical records of 308 women undergoing non donor IVF cycles in a University affiliated teaching hospital. They were classified into three groups: normal weight (BMI 25 30 kg/m 2). All women underwent controlled ovarian hyper stimulation using long agonist protocol. Results : There were 88 (28. 6 &#x 0025;) in the normal weight group, 147 (47. 7 &#x 0025;) in the overweight and 73 (23. 7 &#x 0025;) in the obese group. All three groups were comparable with respect to age, duration of infertility, female and male causes of infertility. The three groups were similar with respect to day 2 LH/FSH levels, endometrial thickness and gonadotrophin requirements, oocyte quality, fertilization, cleavage rates, number of good quality embryos and clinical pregnancy rates. Conclusion :Increase in body mass index in women {{does not appear to have}} an adverse effect on IVF outcome. However, preconceptual counselling for obese women is a must as weight reduction helps in reducing pregnancy-related complications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A high {{body mass}} index (BMI) has been {{associated}} with reduced semen quality and male <b>subfecundity,</b> but no studies following obese men losing weight have yet been published. We examined semen quality and reproductive hormones among morbidly obese men and studied if weight loss improved the reproductive indicators. Methods In this pilot cohort study, 43 men with BMI > 33 kg/m 2 were followed through a 14 week residential weight loss program. The participants provided semen samples and had blood samples drawn, filled in questionnaires, and had clinical examinations before and after the intervention. Conventional semen characteristics as well as sperm DNA integrity, analysed by the sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA) were obtained. Serum levels of testosterone, estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B (Inh-B) were measured. Results Participants were from 20 to 59 years of age (median = 32) with BMI ranging from 33 to 61 kg/m 2. At baseline, after adjustment for potential confounders, BMI was inversely associated with sperm concentration (p = 0. 02), total sperm count (p = 0. 02), sperm morphology (p = 0. 04), and motile sperm (p = 0. 005) as well as testosterone (p = 0. 04) and Inh-B (p = 0. 04) and positively associated to estradiol (p Conclusion This study found obesity to be associated with poor semen quality and altered reproductive hormonal profile. Weight loss may potentially lead to improvement in semen quality. Whether the improvement {{is a result of the}} reduction in body weight per se or improved lifestyles remains unknown. </p...|$|E
40|$|FERTILITY AND MORTALITY, {{the central}} {{processes}} studied by demographers, are clearly biological in nature. Thus, {{it is only}} natural that the interplay between biology and demography has intrigued such renowned population researchers as Alfred Lotka (1934), Louis Henry (1961), and Mindel Sheps (1964). Despite this long-standing interest in biological principles, the actual incorporation of biological variables in population research has started only recently. The advent of new technology that makes collection of relevant biomarkers from human subjects more feasible is causing a surge in biodemographic studies (Wachter and Bulatao 2003; Rodgers and Kohler 2003), and the added value of a multidisciplinary approach that combines biological and social science methods is reflected in an increased range of research questions analyzed in more comprehensive theoretical frameworks. In the case of fertility, the analysis of individual biological parameters can help explain seemingly puzzling or incongruent data from different populations or from couples within the same population. One {{of the best examples}} of the synergy of biodemographic research is the study of the post-partum return to fecundity. In 1961, Louis Henry published a seminal paper on the natural variation in human fertility and the proximate causes of that variation (Henry 1961). He found that the period of postpartum <b>subfecundity</b> was highly variable among natural fertility populations, but that the current social explanations based on postpartum sexual taboos in traditional societies could not account for that variability. Henry suggested that variation in the resumption of ovulation after childbirth might be the most important source of variation in interbirth intervals. He reckoned that the practice of lactation might be related, by some unknown mechanism, to the resumption of post...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{possible}} influence {{of exposure to}} toluene on human fertility. METHODS: In a cross sectional study, a sample of 150 male and 90 female printing industry workers were interviewed retrospectively on reproductive experience with {{a modified version of}} the European study of infertility and <b>subfecundity</b> questionnaire. Exposure categories comprised job descriptions and information on exposure measurements obtained by industrial hygienists. The fecundability ratio (FR) was estimated on the basis of time to pregnancy (TTP) or periods of unprotected intercourse not leading to pregnancy (PUNP) by means of survival analysis with proportional hazard models. Confounders such as age, ethnicity, smoking, parity, pelvic inflammatory diseases, and frequency of sexual intercourse were controlled for in the analyses. RESULTS: 256 Periods of TTP or PUNP were reported by men and 174 by women. After exclusion of induced abortions, birth control failures, and periods without employment for female workers we were able to analyse 169 periods in men and 100 periods in women. Male workers who had been exposed to different concentrations of toluene and their partners did not show a reduction in fecundity. In women (39 periods occurred during exposure) fecundity was reduced (FR 0. 47, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 29 to 0. 77). Neither, restriction to only the first period nor exclusion of PUNPs changed the results (FR 0. 48, 95 % CI 0. 24 to 0. 97). CONCLUSION: After considering possible biases, low daily exposure to toluene in women seems to be associated with reduced fecundity. This result is in accordance with other findings for organic solvents and supports both the hypotheses that (a) organic solvents could affect hormonal regulation, and that (b) organic solvents increase early fetal losses which in turn contributes to longer times of unprotected intercourse...|$|E
