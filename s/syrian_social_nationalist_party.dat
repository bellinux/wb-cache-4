5|$|Modern Syria {{was first}} {{established}} in 1920 as the Arab Kingdom of Syria under King Faisal. This state was {{planned to be}} a new Arab kingdom, and not just Syrian, and the state espoused Arab nationalism and pan-Islamic policies. However the British, who had helped establish the state after World War I, made a secret agreement with France and established the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon. The area thereby functioned as one of France's colonies, and the newly established state was viewed unfavorably by most Syrians, with many of them regarding it as a vessel of European imperialism. At this stage, some movements tried to establish a Syrian identity, most notably the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party,</b> or became advocates of communism and Islamism. The majority of Syrians continued to see themselves as Arabs rather than Syrians.|$|E
5|$|Born on 9 January 1910 in Damascus to {{a middle}} class Greek Orthodox Christian family, his father, Joseph, working as a grain merchant. Aflaq was first educated in the westernized schools of the French Mandate of Syria. In 1929, he left Syria to study {{philosophy}} abroad at the Sorbonne in Paris. During his stay Aflaq {{was influenced by the}} works of Henri Bergson, and met his longtime collaborator Salah al-Din al-Bitar, a fellow Syrian nationalist. Aflaq founded an Arab Student Union at the Sorbonne, and discovered the writings of Karl Marx. He returned to Syria in 1932, and became active in communist politics, but left the movement when the government of Léon Blum, supported by the French Communist Party (FCP), continued France's old politics towards its colonies. Aflaq, and others, had believed that the FCP followed pro-independence policies towards the French colonies. It had not helped that the Syrian–Lebanese Communist Party (SLCP) supported the FCP's decision. From then on Aflaq saw the communist movement as a tool of the Soviet Union. He was impressed by the organisation and ideology of Antun Saadeh's <b>Syrian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E

50|$|He {{spent his}} early years growing up in Jaffa, Palestine and Acre, Palestine before {{attending}} American University in Beirut, where he graduated with a B.A. in Philosophy. He then traveled to study at the University of Chicago, where he completed an M.A. in Philosophy in 1949. Politically active from a young age, Sharabi then returned to serve {{as editor of the}} <b>Syrian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party’s</b> monthly magazine al-Jil al-Jadid (The New Generation). Forced to flee to Jordan after the parties disbanding in 1949, Sharabi returned to the United States where he completed a Ph.D. in the history of culture, again at the University at Chicago. That same year, he began to teach at Georgetown University, where he gained full professorship in eleven years.|$|R

50|$|He {{joined the}} Liberal Alliance {{and was one}} of the founders, in 1933, of the <b>Social</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> of Rio Grande do Norte (PSN). Café Filho was elected federal deputy (1935-1937) and stood out for the defense of {{constitutional}} liberties. Threatened with arrest, sought asylum in Argentina, returning to Brazil in 1938. He founded, along with Ademar de Barros, the Progressive Republican Party (PRP), for which he was elected federal deputy again (1946-1950). Elected vice president by a coalition of parties that merged under the symbol Progressive Social Party (PSP), he assumed the presidency with the suicide of Getúlio Vargas, August 24, 1954.|$|R
25|$|Prime {{suspects}} {{include the}} pro-Syrian {{faction of the}} Lebanese <b>Syrian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> (SSNP), {{in collaboration with the}} Ba'ath Party. In June 2005, former secretary general of the Lebanese Communist Party George Hawi claimed in an interview with Al Jazeera, that Rifaat al-Assad, brother of Hafez al Assad and uncle of Syria's current President Bashar al-Assad, had been behind the killing of Jumblatt.|$|E

Gabbard {{said in a}} release that the trip was {{approved}} by the House Ethics Committee and sponsored by Arab American Community Center for Economic and Social Services (AACCESS-Ohio). The chairman of AACCESS, Bassem Khawam, accompanied Gabbard on the trip, as did Elie Khawam. Both men are officials in the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> (SSNP), which has fought on the side of Assad regime, but Bassem Khawam has denied that AACCESS is connected to the SSNP.|$|E
25|$|On 9 May 1968 he was reelected Deputy for {{the seventh}} time. In 1970, he was once again {{appointed}} Minister of the Interior, a reward for his last-minute switch of allegiance {{in the presidential election}} that year, which resulted in Suleiman Franjieh's victory by one vote over Elias Sarkis. His support of Franjieh, whose presidency 1970-1976 is regarded as egregiously corrupt, from a sometime supporter of the Chebab reforms, was crucial. As Interior Minister, he legalized the Communist Party (LCP) and the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> (SSNP). In 1972, Kamal Jumblatt was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize by the Soviet Union. The same year, he was reelected Deputy for the eighth time. The following year, he was unanimously elected Secretary General of the Arab Front, a movement supportive of the Palestinian revolution.|$|E
50|$|Six smaller {{political}} parties {{are permitted to}} exist and, along with the Ba'ath Party, make up the National Progressive Front (NPF), a grouping of parties that represents the sole framework of legal political party participation for citizens. While created ostensibly to {{give the appearance of}} a multi-party system, the NPF is dominated by the Ba'ath Party and does not change the essentially one-party character of the political system. Non-Ba'ath Party members of the NPF exist as {{political parties}} largely in name only and conform strictly to Ba'ath Party and government policies. There were reports in 2000 that the government was considering legislation to expand the NPF to include new parties and several parties previously banned; these changes have not taken place. However, one such party- the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Nationalist</b> Party- was legalised in 2005.|$|R
5000|$|There were discussions {{within the}} Ba'ath Party if Qanso {{was to give}} up his {{candidacy}} in the Baalbek-Hermel electoral district to Fayez Shukr, the leader of the Ba'ath Party. Qanso announced his candidacy for a seat in the Baalbek-Hermel electoral district in April 2009. In the 2009 parliamentary election, the Ba'ath Party won two seats as part of the March 8 Alliance; Qanso and Qassem Hashem. Qanso was elected to parliament in the Baalbek-Hermel district. The United States Government led by Barack Obama announced an extension of its travel ban and asset freeze against those seeking “to undermine Lebanon’s legitimate and democratically elected government.” Qanso was amongst those effected by the extension of sanctions. The Ba'ath Party which supports Najib Mikati, the current Prime Minister of Lebanon, claimed, through Qanso, that it [...] "should have been represented in the Mikati government, just like the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Nationalist</b> Party”.|$|R
5000|$|The SSNP [...] "Zawbaa" [...] (Vortex, Tempest) is a glyph {{combining}} the Muslim crescent and the Christian cross, derived from Mesopotamian art, and it symbolizes the blood shed by the martyrs {{which makes the}} wheel of history whirl forward, dissipating the surrounding darkness (representing sectarianism and Ottoman occupation and the colonial oppression which followed). Within the party, Saadeh gained a cult of personality and advocated a totalitarian system of government, {{at the same time}} glorifying the pre-Christian past of the Syrian people. Saadeh was named the party leader for life. However, according to Haytham, Saadeh stated that European fascism didn't influence him. Haytham claims that Saadeh's <b>Syrian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Nationalist</b> ideology aimed at opposite ends; in contrast to National Socialism, Social Nationalism bases itself on a dynamic social entity (which is composed of many elements, from religion to language, culture, history, need, and mainly human interaction) defining its national identity and not the imposition of one ideal identity (e.g. blond hair, blue eyes) on the many factions.|$|R
25|$|Examples of {{this were}} the Lebanese Communist Party (LCP) and the more radical and {{independent}} Communist Action Organization (COA). Another notable example was the pan-Syrian <b>Syrian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> (SSNP), which promoted the concept of Greater Syria, in contrast to Pan-Arab or Lebanese nationalism. The SSNP was generally aligned with the Syrian government, although it did not ideologically approve of the Ba'athist government (however, this has changed recently, under Bashar Al-Assad, the SSNP having been allowed to exert political activity in Syria as well). The multi-confessional SSNP was led by Inaam Raad, a Catholic and Abdallah Saadeh, a Greek Orthodox. It was active in North Lebanon (Koura and Akkar), West Beirut (around Hamra Street), in Mount Lebanon (High Metn, Baabda, Aley and Chouf), in South Lebanon (Zahrani, Nabatieh, Marjayoun and Hasbaya) and the Beqqa Valley (Baalbeck, Hermel and Rashaya).|$|E
25|$|Alawites {{initially}} opposed {{a united}} Syrian state (since they thought {{their status as}} a religious minority would endanger them), and Hafez's father shared this belief. As the French left Syria, many Syrians mistrusted Alawites because of their alignment with France. Hafez left his Alawite village, beginning his education at age nine in Sunni-dominated Latakia. He {{was the first in}} his family to attend high school, but in Latakia Assad faced Sunni anti-Alawite bias. He was an excellent student, winning several prizes at about age 14. Assad lived in a poor, predominantly Alawite part of Latakia; to fit in, he approached political parties that welcomed Alawites. These parties (which also espoused secularism) were the Syrian Communist Party, the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> (SSNP) and the Arab Ba'ath Party; Assad joined the latter in 1946, and some of his friends belonged to the SSNP. The Ba'ath (Renaissance) Party espoused a pan-Arabist, socialist ideology.|$|E
25|$|The 2006–2008 Lebanese protests were {{a series}} of {{political}} protests and sit-ins that began on December 1, 2006, led by groups in Lebanon that opposed the US and Saudi-backed government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora and ended on May 21, 2008 following the Doha Agreement. The opposition group {{was made up of}} Hezbollah, Amal, and the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM); a number of smaller parties were also involved, including the Marada party, the Lebanese Communist Party and the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party.</b> The majority {{of the members of the}} government were part of the anti-Syrian March 14 Alliance, a coalition of political parties and independents in Lebanon. The two groups were also divided along religious lines, with most Sunnis and Druze supporting the government, and most Shi'a supporting the opposition group. The Christian community was split between the two factions, with Michel Aoun, the leader of the FPM, claiming to have more than 70% support among the Christians, according to the results of the 2005 parliamentary elections.|$|E
50|$|The 1968 coup {{which saw}} Juan Velasco Alvarado brought to power also saw UNO {{disappear}} from the political scene. De la Piedra meanwhile broke away, and formed his <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Social</b> Democrat <b>Party</b> the same year.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nationalist</b> <b>Social</b> Democrat <b>Party</b> (in Spanish: Partido Social Demócrata Nacionalista) was a {{political}} party in Peru founded in 1968 by a dissident fraction of general Manuel A. Odría's Unión Nacional Odriísta. PSDN was led by Julio de la Piedra.|$|R
50|$|Darréu {{periodically}} holds {{different political}} and cultural activities. Some of their most known activities are the Asturies nun escaez ("Asturias does not forget") commemorative concerts of the Asturian October 1934 Revolution, which from 2006 are integrated in the Día de la Mocedá Revolucionario ("Day of Revolutionary Youth").

25|$|During the June 1982 Israeli {{invasion}} of Lebanon the PSP/PLA remained neutral, with Walid Jumblatt refusing to allow PLO units to operate within Druze territory and the PSP militia forces did not {{fought against the}} Israel Defense Forces (IDF), even though they supported their arch-enemies the Maronite Kataeb Party and its military arm, the Lebanese Forces (LF) militia. However, when President Amine Gemayel refused to grant the Druze community the expected political representation, Walid Jumblatt formed in response on July 1983 a Palestinian- and Syrian-backed military coalition, the Lebanese National Salvation Front (LNSF), that rallied several Lebanese Muslim and Christian parties and militias opposed to the U.S.-sponsored May 17 Agreement with Israel. Led by Jumblatt's PSP/PLA, the alliance gathered its rivals of the Druze Yazbaki clan, the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> (SSNP), the Al-Mourabitoun and the Lebanese Communist Party (LCP)/Popular Guards, which fought the LF, the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and the U.S. Marines contingent of the Multinational Force (MNF) in the Chouf and Aley Districts and at West Beirut between September 1983 and February 1984.|$|E
25|$|Despite the cease-fire, the {{shelling}} {{of the camps}} continued. In Beirut, the ongoing blockade of the camps led to dramatic food and medicine shortages inside the camps, resulting in horrible conditions for the residents. In February 1987, the fighting spread throughout West Beirut, with Hezbollah and the PSP/PLA supporting the Palestinians. The LCP/Popular Guard and the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> (SSNP) aligned with the PSP/PLA in attacking Amal positions. Amal was overpowered as the PSP/PLA quickly seized large portions of West Beirut, and the situation {{could no longer be}} tolerated by Damascus. Under the command of Syria's military intelligence chief in Lebanon, General Ghazi Kenaan, the Syrian Army began moving into West Beirut in 21 February 1987 and attacked the Hezbollah's headquarters in the Fathallah barracks, leading to a short period of fighting between Syrian units and Hezbollah guerrillas. In 7 April 1987 Amal finally lifted the siege and handed over its positions around the camps to the Syrian Army. Later, in the summer of 1988, Abu Musa returned to the camps, and another 127 people were killed in the fighting. After this episode, the War of the Camps was considered to be concluded by July 1988.|$|E
25|$|The small Druze sect, {{strategically}} and dangerously {{seated on}} the Chouf in central Lebanon, had no natural allies, and so were compelled to put much effort into building alliances. Under {{the leadership of the}} Jumblatt family, first Kamal Jumblatt (the LNM leader) and then his son Walid, the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) (Arabic: الحزب التقدمي الاشتراكي, al-hizb al-taqadummi al-ishtiraki) served as an effective Druze militia, building excellent ties to the Soviet Union mainly, and with Syria upon the withdrawal of Israel to the south of the country. However, many Druze in Lebanon at the time were members of the non-religious party, the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party.</b> Under Kamal Jumblatt's leadership, the PSP was a major element in the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) which supported Lebanon's Arab identity and sympathized with the Palestinians. It built a powerful private army, which proved {{to be one of the}} strongest in the Lebanese Civil War of 1975 to 1990. It conquered much of Mount Lebanon and the Chouf District. Its main adversaries were the Maronite Christian Phalangist militia, and later the Lebanese Forces militia (which absorbed the Phalangists). The PSP suffered a major setback in 1977, when Kamal Jumblatt was assassinated. His son Walid succeeded him as leader of the party.|$|E
40|$|Different survey-based {{and case}} study {{research}} has shown that, since the 1980 s, minority <b>nationalist</b> <b>parties</b> have become increasingly supportive of European integration. However, this account of minority <b>nationalist</b> <b>party</b> attitudes towards Europe is problematic in several respects. This book makes a major contribution to the academic literature by undertaking a comparative study of the attitudes of minority <b>nationalist</b> <b>parties</b> towards European integration. The volume provides: a systematic analysis {{of the ways in}} which minority <b>nationalist</b> <b>party</b> attitudes towards European integration have evolved from 1979 to 2005; original empirical data on hitherto under-researched minority <b>nationalist</b> <b>parties</b> in Wales, Galicia and Corsica; and, major new insights into the European attitudes of minority <b>nationalist</b> <b>parties.</b> This book challenges the general assumption in the academic literature that the minority <b>nationalist</b> <b>party</b> family will always be pro-European and demonstrates how it needs to be revised in light of the evidence provided by this study.

2500|$|Long-standing enemies {{since the}} 1860s, the Druze {{have always been}} {{at odds with the}} Maronites, and acts of barbarism on both sides have bedevilled their ability to co-exist for centuries past. [...] On 16 March 1977, the PSP leader Kamal Jumblatt was ambushed and killed in his car near Baakline in the Chouf by {{unidentified}} gunmen (allegedly, members of the pro-Syrian faction of the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> or SSNP, acting in collusion with the Syrian military commander of the Mount Lebanon region, Colonel Ibrahim Houeijy); believing that the perpetrators were members of the Phalangist Kataeb Regulatory Forces (KRF) or Tigers Militias, PLA militiamen extracted swift retribution on the local Maronite population living in the intermixed towns and villages around Baakline. Despite the hasty dispatch on March 17 of 4,000 Syrian Army troops from the Arab Deterrent Force (ADF) to keep the peace in the Chouf, it is estimated that 250 Maronite villagers were killed in reprisal actions at the towns of Moukhtara and Barouk, and at the villages of Mazra'et El Chouf and Ma'aser El Chouf.|$|E
2500|$|Maher Abd Al-Hafiz Hajjar, {{formerly}} {{from the}} People's Will Party, a 43-year-old MP from Aleppo. This party {{is led by}} veteran opposition leader Qadri Jamil who supported the initial protests in 2011 but then described calls for {{the overthrow of the}} government as [...] "unrealistic and useless". Jamil {{was a member of the}} committee that drafted the new Constitution of Syria in 2011. However, People's Will won just two of 250 MPs in the 2012 parliamentary election with their allies from the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> won a further four. Jamil was nominated Deputy Prime Minister by President Assad in June 2012 but was removed in October 2013. The small number of MPs from the party indicates that most of his nominations must have come from either independents or MPs from the ruling National Progressive Front. A statement from the People's Will Party on 27 April distanced the party from Hajjar, claiming that Hajjar was no longer a member of either the People's Will Party, or the Popular Front for Liberation and Change. Instead the statement claimed that Hajjar represented only himself.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 June 23 Syrian demonstrators {{were killed}} and over a hundred injured by Israeli troops after {{attempting}} to enter the Israeli-held part of the Golan Heights. [...] "Anyone who tries {{to cross the border}} will be killed," [...] Israeli soldiers warned through megaphones as people waving Palestinian flags streamed towards the frontier. When protesters tried to cut the razor wire several meters short of the frontier fence, Israeli troops opened fire. Several people were seen being carried away on stretchers. In the aftermath, thousands began a sit-in near the frontier, resulting in Syrian security forces creating a security buffer zone to prevent more demonstrators from approaching the border. Lebanese President Michel Sleiman accused Israel of genocide over the incident, UN High Commissioner on Human Rights Navanethem Pillay condemned the Israel Defense Forces' use of force against unarmed, civilian protesters, and the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> called for an international response to the incident, calling it a [...] "massacre". An Israeli military spokeswoman called the violence [...] "an attempt to divert international attention from the bloodbath going on in Syria." [...] Michael Weiss, a spokesperson for Just Journalism, claimed that he had received leaked Syrian state documents showing that the Syrian government organized the Nakba Day protests to draw attention away from the uprising in Syria proper. US State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the U.S. believes President Bashar Assad's government was actively supporting the Palestinian protests near the Israeli border.|$|E

At that time, the Lebanese Christian Militia, {{also known as the}} Phalangists, were allied with Israel. The Israeli command authorized the entrance of a force of approximately 150 Phalangist fighters' into the Sabra and the Shatila refugee camp. Chatila had previously been one of the PLO's three main training camps for foreign militants and the main training camp for European militants; the Israelis maintained that 2,000 to 3,000 terrorists remained in the camps, but were unwilling to risk the lives of more of their soldiers after the Lebanese army repeatedly refused to [...] "clear them out." [...] Between 460 and 3,500 civilians, mostly Palestinians and Lebanese Shiites were massacred by the Phalangists, who themselves suffered only two casualties. The Lebanese army's chief prosecutor investigated the killings and counted 460 dead, Israeli intelligence estimated 700–800 dead, and the Palestinian Red Crescent claimed 2,000 dead. 1,200 death certificates were issued to anyone who produced three witnessing claiming a family member disappeared {{during the time of the}} massacre. Nearly all of the victims were men. Israeli troops surrounded the camps with tanks and checkpoints, monitoring entrances and exits. Further, Israeli investigation by the Kahan Commission of Inquiry found that Ariel Sharon bore [...] "personal responsibility" [...] for failing to prevent the massacre, and for failing to act once he learned of the massacre. The Commission recommended that he be removed as Defense Minister and that he never hold a position in any future Israeli government.
