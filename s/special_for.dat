5|$|The {{complications}} {{of a stroke}} suffered by Clark in December 2004 had a major effect on {{his role in the}} special. After having Regis Philbin serve as a guest host for 2005, Clark returned to the <b>special</b> <b>for</b> the 2006 edition: due to speech impediments resulting from his stroke, Clark ceded hosting duties to Ryan Seacrest, but still made limited appearances.
