The bank has already established its network in different area of the country with assistance of BRAC. BRAC Bank is trying to develop economic condition of the country. So the bank provides loan facility 3 to 30 lacs taka to that small and medium enterprise that has no easy access to banks/financial institutes. The bank already established 41 Zones and 624 <b>SME</b> <b>offices</b> all over the country. There is 2104 Officers providing service to clients. Till 2014, the bank Disbursed 471618 loans which amount is Tk 291871 million. The success of SME will largely depends on the selection of a business and man behind the business. BRAC Bank provides this facility to those whose business operation is minimum one year and environment friendly business. It provides no loan facility to tobacco business. The business should be legally registered and must have valid trade license. The entrepreneur should be physically able, preferably between the ages 21 to 50. She/he must have the necessary technical skills to run the business and acceptable social standing in the community i. e. people should speak highly of him/her.

The guarantor should know the entrepreneur reasonable well and should preferable live in the same community. SME loan can be repaid in two ways, 1) in equal monthly loan installment with monthly interest payment. 2) By one single payment at maturity, with interest repayable a quarter ends residual on maturity. Customer relation officers search new potential customer by providing door-to-door service. They talk with clients and monitor their manners, activities of their business and provide the loan to the potential customers. SME, BRAC Bank may provide 100 % of net required working capital but not exceeding 75 % of the aggregate value of the inventory and account receivable. Normally, organizations meet their working capital from over draft loan but BRAC Bank designed the loan to meet working capital but as term loan which is repaid in installment. The customer relation officers also monitor the borrowers’ activities after the loan disbursement. Monitoring also facilitates the buildup of an information base for future reference. Asset Operation Department acts as the last line defense of the bank. This division is responsible for the complete disbursement, recovery and closing procedures. The procedures start from the sanction of the SME loan. The respective select potential enterprise, collect confidential information about the enterprise, open clients account is the respective bank where BRAC Bank has its own account, filled up CIB form and send it to the Asset Operation Department. Then the Asset Operation Department starts its activities. The Asset Operation Department sends the CIB form to the Bangladesh Bank to know the CIB status of the applicant. If the report found clean then it send back to the unit office for send proposal for the loan. Then the unit office sanction loan and send it again in Asset Operation Department for disbursement. The Asset Operation Department then prepare a loan file and checks all necessary documents, prepare a list and disburse it. Then the Asset Operation Department starts enter all information regarding the loan in the banking software “Millennium Banking System (MBS) ” which includes initial ID generation, loan account opening, risk fund collection, activation of the loan. Post disbursement manual activities includes repayment schedule send to unit office, documents stamp cancellation, send the loan file to archive.

Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are important to almost all economies in the world, especially to the developing countries as they face major employment and income distribution challenges. There are about 60 lakh SMEs and microenterprises in Bangladesh, according to Asian Development Bank. In recent times, SMEs have come into the forefront of development agenda due to the recognition of their contribution in fostering growth, sustaining global economic recovery, generating employment and reducing poverty. Both micro-finance institutions and banks {{are beginning to realize}} the potential of SME market and are designing new financial products for it. Some banks and other financial institutions had been providing loans to such enterprises for long, though not in the classification of SME Financing. Now, almost all banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) in the country are providing loans to the sector, under different governmental schemes as well as through their own product portfolios. BRAC, the largest private development organization of the world, believes that micro finance is an important tool in breaking the cycle of poverty. BRAC realized that there is a vast group of small and medium entrepreneurs in the country, who have no access to institutional credit. Upon realization BRAC introduced a full-fledged commercial bank- BRAC Bank, in July 2001. BRAC Bank‟s effort is noted in this regard for its complete focus on the credit needs of the small and medium enterprises. Since the initiation of SME operations by BRAC Bank, it has become the Bank‟s largest and most profitable venture.

40|$|Abstract. To date, {{broadcasting}} traffic data {{represents a}} low percent-age {{of the total}} traffic in the Internet {{when compared to other}} kinds of information. This may be caused by difficulties with multicast transmis-sions (i. e filtering by ISPs), low bandwidth rates in the last mile access, quality of service (QoS) and the use of Network Address Translation (NAT) boxes in <b>SME's</b> and home <b>offices</b> (SOHOs). Research efforts in Next Generation Networks (NGN) are under way to create networks with true triple-play capabilities to overcome these problems. Several standardisation bodies like ITU-T and ETSI have working groups aimed at developing a general NGN architecture able to transport any type of traffic with an associated QoS. There are several results available (for example, ETSI TISPAN has published its Release 1) but there is still on-going work on different subjects, such as broadcasting transport in NGNs, where ETSI TISPAN has approved the study of IPTV in NGN as a high priority issue. This article focuses on the problems and solutions of a flexible, easily upgradeable broadcast enabled RGW (Residential Gateway) designed to work in an NGN scenario where multicast traffic, NAT boxes and QoS must be taken into consideration. ...|$|R

40|$|The Ministry of Economic affairs has {{appointed}} eight innovation programs {{to create a}} network of large companies, SME’s and knowledge institutions within a specific sector, in which interaction and innovation is stimulated. One of these innovation programs is ‘Life Sciences & Health’ (LSH). The aim of this innovation program {{is to improve the}} innovation and investment climate of the Dutch life sciences and health sector. One of the objectives of the program is to reduce the time of valorization of fundamental knowledge into socio-economic benefits. By removing the hurdles of the life sciences and health sector, LSH tries to stimulate the innovativeness and profits of the organizations and to improve the healthcare of patients by providing services to the stakeholders in this sector. Stakeholders in the sector have to collaborate and interact with LSH when they make use of the services of LSH. When the goals, perceptions and services of LSH are not in line with the characteristics of the stakeholders, a difference in congruence will come in existence, which leads to dysfunctional relationships between them. The aim of this research is to contribute {{to the success of the}} innovation program by decreasing the differences in characteristics like goals, perceptions and services between stakeholders and LSH. The research question of this research is therefore: ‘How can the organization ‘Life Sciences & Health’, functioning as a knowledge intensive business service in a principal agent relationship with its stakeholders decrease the asymmetry problems between them in order to improve its services towards the stakeholders and to diminish the differences in congruence between them and strengthen the commitment of the stakeholders towards the innovation program?’. In this research, not all involved stakeholders of the life sciences and health sector are included, but three stakeholder groups are identified as most important stakeholders for LSH. Those stakeholders are small and medium sized enterprises (<b>SME’s),</b> technology transfer <b>offices</b> (TTO’s) and regional initiatives (RI’s). To be able to detect the differences in characteristics between LSH and those stakeholders, a theoretical framework combining the principal-agent theory and the theory of KIBS is used. This theoretical frameworks compares both the organizational and service characteristics of the stakeholders with those of LSH. The differences in characteristics are classified in asymmetry problems. A distinction is made in differences in characteristics between LSH and the stakeholders and in differences in characteristics between the different groups of stakeholders. The asymmetries between LSH and the stakeholder groups are goal asymmetry, perception asymmetry and service compatibility. Asymmetries between the different stakeholders are goal asymmetry, barrier asymmetry, stimuli asymmetry, awareness asymmetry, service asymmetry and vision asymmetry. Via literature study, observable indicators of all characteristics are collected. Via interviews, each of the stakeholders had to indicate to what extent they thought that each observable indicator was important on a 5 -points scale. Both the mean score and the coefficient of variation is determined for each indicator separately and for each stakeholder group individually. LSH was asked the same. The first part of the analysis was to identify which indicators were most important for each of the characteristics. This is done for all stakeholders individually, and additionally for the indicators of LSH. By comparing the scores of LSH with the scores of the stakeholders, and by comparing the scores of the different stakeholders, the degree of the asymmetry problems could be determined. The second step of the theoretical framework is to decrease those asymmetry problems, in order to align the services of LSH to the needs and wishes of the stakeholders, and to align the goals of the stakeholders with those of LSH in order to improve the level of commitment of the stakeholders towards the innovation program. There are several ways in which the asymmetry problems between LSH and the stakeholders could be decreased. The actions that should be taken by LSH can be divided into three groups. First, LSH has to be aware of the needs and wishes of each stakeholder group. In that way, the services of LSH can support the stakeholders in improving their activities. Without knowledge about the characteristics of the stakeholders, it is possible that the services of LSH are not in line with the needs of the stakeholders, what could lead to a lack of use of the services by the stakeholders. Suggestions to maintain the awareness of the needs of stakeholders is by communicating with them and by giving them the opportunity to tell their needs to LSH. The second step that should be taken is to act upon the needs of the stakeholders by means of adjusting the services of LSH to the needs of the stakeholders. This can be achieved by providing useful information needed by the stakeholders, but also by functioning as lobby between stakeholders and third parties. An example is to function as mediator between SME’s and the government by searching for solutions for subsidy problems. Finally, LSH should increase the awareness of stakeholders about the innovation program and the possibility for stakeholders to make use of the innovation program. Without stakeholders knowing about the innovation program, they cannot make use of it, and LSH is than not able to improve the innovation processes of these stakeholders. Additionally, the innovation and investment climate of the Dutch life sciences and health sector cannot be improved. Awareness of stakeholders of the innovation program can best be achieved by personal contact with stakeholders. Furthermore, the website of LSH should be more user-focused. By taking these three steps, the asymmetry problems between LSH and the stakeholders can be decreased. When the goals and perceptions of both LSH and the stakeholders are in line with each other, the level of trust and commitment towards each other will increase. Furthermore, the services of LSH will better be aligned with the needs of stakeholders...|$|R
