50|$|Critics {{feel that}} there are some downsides as these {{technologies}} are more prone to failure and have a much steeper learning curve for the user than a <b>standard</b> <b>overhead</b> projector.|$|R
50|$|An <b>overhead</b> <b>join</b> is a {{conventional}} method for an aircraft to approach and safely land at an airfield. It helps a pilot to integrate with any air traffic pattern near an airfield, join any circuit, and land.|$|R
50|$|Alternatives to the <b>overhead</b> <b>join</b> are to {{directly}} join the circuit by entering at a suitable corner, or a straight-in approach. If available, ATC will {{negotiate with the}} pilot {{which is the most}} appropriate method according to the current traffic situation.|$|R
50|$|Spey casting is {{a casting}} {{technique}} used in fly fishing. Spey casting {{can be accomplished}} with either a normal length fly rod, or a rod {{referred to as a}} double-handed fly rod, often called a Spey rod. Spey rods can also be used for <b>standard</b> <b>overhead</b> casting.|$|R
50|$|Aircraft may {{arrive at}} the landing site from any direction, so a safe means of {{integrating}} into existing traffic and aligning with the runway is required. The <b>overhead</b> <b>join</b> is the <b>standard</b> method used in the UK, South Africa and other Commonwealth countries at smaller airports by general aviation aircraft flying under the visual flight rules (VFR), and especially at airfields with no regular radio service.|$|R
50|$|In 1965 {{the scheme}} was {{extended}} to the brand-new Tinsley Marshalling Yard in Sheffield. The locomotive facilities at the Sheffield {{end of the line}} were moved from Darnall to the new Tinsley depot. The overhead line equipment on this section was designed to be easily convertible to 25kV AC electrification, which by now had been accepted as the <b>standard</b> <b>overhead</b> electrification system for BR.|$|R
40|$|One {{solution}} {{to the lack of}} native multicast is CastGate. It makes use of tunneling to transmit data to end hosts. We describe a {{solution to}} improve this technology with the aid of PIM-SM. Further we evaluate the different CastGate based solutions, and compare them to native multicast. Some of the metrics (stress, resource usage, stretch) can be evaluated whilst other metrics (control <b>overhead,</b> <b>join</b> latency) can be determined only through measurement in a real testbed...|$|R
40|$|Projection of one {{drawing on}} another with {{projected}} image adjusted to have same scale as other drawing permits quick comparisons of such features as relative sizes of parts and clearance or interferences in assemblies. Technique uses <b>standard</b> <b>overhead</b> projector and transparency of one drawing to project an enlarged image, {{the scale of}} which matches scale of second drawings. Image may be traced directly onto copy of second drawing...|$|R
50|$|A compact {{overhead}} {{transmission line}} requires a smaller right of way than a <b>standard</b> <b>overhead</b> powerline. Conductors must not {{get too close to}} each other. This can be achieved either by short span lengths and insulating crossbars, or by separating the conductors in the span with insulators. The first type is easier to build as it does not require insulators in the span, which may be difficult to install and to maintain.|$|R
50|$|The coaster’s {{track is}} {{essentially}} a large U shape that is loaded at the base and uses a series of LIMs to accelerate the train up {{each side of the}} track. One side of the track is twisted track (commonly called an inline twist) that ends in a straight section angled at about 45 degrees, the other side is a perfectly vertical straight track. The train seats 28 riders in a <b>standard</b> <b>overhead</b> suspended design.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — One of {{the many}} {{solutions}} to the present lack of native multicast is offered by CastGate. Like other Alternative Group Communication Services, CastGate makes use of UDP tunneling to relay multicast data. We determine the performance of CastGate {{and its impact on}} the network, using several metrics All the different CastGate solutions are taken into account, and the results are then compared to native multicast. Some of the metrics (stress, resource usage, stretch) can be evaluated, whilst other metrics (control <b>overhead,</b> <b>join</b> latency) can only be determined through measurements in a testbed...|$|R
40|$|The FAA {{restraint}} system experiments consisted of 24 standard and modified seats, 2 standard galleys and 2 <b>standard</b> <b>overhead</b> compartments. Under the controlled impact demonstration (CID) program, the experimental {{objective was to}} demonstrate the effectiveness of individual {{restraint system}} designs when exposed to a survivable air-to-ground impact condition. What researchers were looking for was the performance exhibited by standard and modified designs, performance differences resulting from their installed cabin location, and interrelating performance demonstrated by test article and attaching floor and/or fuselage structure. The other restraint system experiment consisted of 2 <b>standard</b> <b>overhead</b> stowage compartments and 2 galley modules. Again, researchers were concerned with the retention of stowed equipment and carry-on articles. The overhead compartments were loaded with test weights up to their maximum capacity, {{and each of the}} galleys was filled with test articles: aft with normal galley equipment, forward with hazardous material test packages. A breakdown of instrumentation and distribution is given beginning with 11 instrumented type anthropomorphic dummies and 185 sensors which provided for acceleration and load measurements at the various experiment and associated structure locations. The onboard cameras provided additional coverage of these experiments, including the areas of cabin which were not instrumented. Test results showing the window-side leg forces versus pulse duration are given...|$|R
5000|$|Another notable {{attribute}} {{worth mentioning}} {{is that the}} appreneur {{does not require the}} <b>standard</b> <b>overhead</b> and infrastructure that a traditional business requires. Embracing the leverage points of outsourcing, and distribution handled by the mobile device service providers, and appreneur can get an app on the market with little more than an idea and a marginal development fee. [...] An increasing number of teenagers, and even pre-teens are launching successful careers as appreneurs. With the ease of farming out work that the internet increasingly provides, this career path is open to anyone, which is again a sharp contrast to the traditional entrepreneur model.|$|R

5000|$|Cnet explains, [...] "Clue offers full {{animations}} of {{the characters}} walking from room to room. While this is interesting for a while, you'll probably {{want to play with}} the <b>standard</b> <b>overhead</b> view of the board. Along with the animations is a really good soundtrack that includes sounds of the storm outside the mansion and a forbidding butler who calls out each suggestion as it is played". It adds, [...] "The [...] "autonotes" [...] feature that takes notes as to what cards you've seen doesn't record what suggestions have already been made, so making educated guesses as to which cards people don't have by their suggestions becomes a pen and paper experience".|$|R
50|$|Fester {{must travel}} through the city sewers to reach areas that are {{otherwise}} inaccessible due to aboveground obstacles. He may enter certain buildings, which transform the game from its <b>standard</b> <b>overhead</b> view into a 3D mode of play akin to a dungeon crawl. Five of these buildings each house an enormous Alien Boss character, which upon defeat will supply Fester with a puzzle piece, {{a picture of the}} alien's UFO, and refill all of his items. After defeating a boss, Fester will leave the building and be unable to backtrack through it to previously visited areas. Once all five bosses are defeated, Fester must board the UFO and defeat one last boss in order to stave off the invasion.|$|R
50|$|A {{compromise}} between undergrounding and using overhead lines is installing air cables. Aerial cables are insulated cables spun between poles {{and used for}} power transmission or telecommunication services. An advantage of aerial cables is that their insulation removes the danger of electric shock (unless the cables are damaged). Another advantage is that they forgo the costs - particularly high in rocky areas - of burying. The disadvantages of aerial cables are {{that they have the}} same aesthetic issues as <b>standard</b> <b>overhead</b> lines and that they can be affected by storms. However if the insulation is not destroyed during pylon failure or when hit by a tree, there is no interruption of service. Electrical hazards are minimised and re-hanging the cables may be possible without power interruption.|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{methods of}} accounting-including full-absorption accounting, labor and cost <b>standards,</b> <b>overhead</b> allocations, and {{variance}} analysis-can {{stand in the}} way of attempts by managers and others to improve their company's overall performance and the ability to compete globally. Many companies have recognized the need to shift the role of accounting toward higher-value, more strategic tasks, such as financial and operational analysis, tactical decision support, and even process improvement and reengineering. But the accounting tools at their disposal often prove inadequate. In fact, there is a core conflict between the need to provide accurate and consistent financial reports for external consumption-reports that comply in all respects with GAAP, Sarbanes-Oxley, SEC requirements, and the like-and the need for value-relevant and informative reports for internal management purposes. 2004 Morgan Stanley. ...|$|R
40|$|Computer vision {{approaches}} for retail applications can provide value {{far beyond the}} common domain of loss prevention. Gaining insight into the movement and behaviors of shoppers is of high interest for marketing, merchandizing, store operations and data mining. Of particular interest {{is the process of}} purchase decision making. What catches a customers attention? What products go unnoticed? What does a customer look at before making a final decision? Towards this goal we presents a system that detects and tracks both the location and gaze of shoppers in retail environments. While networks of <b>standard</b> <b>overhead</b> store cameras are used for tracking the location of customers, small inshelf cameras are used for estimating customer gaze. The presented system operates robustly in real-time and can be deployed in a variety of retail applications. 1...|$|R

40|$|From the {{perspective}} of facility maintenance, a larger cross sectional area of contact wire is more favorable to lengthen the replacement cycle of contact wires that become worn by contact pantographs. However, weight of a contact wire increases with a larger cross sectional area. We thus reviewed the balance between the cross sectional area and the tension of the contact wire for the heavy compound catenary system shown in Fig. 1, the <b>standard</b> <b>overhead</b> contact line system for the Tohoku and Joetsu Shinkansen, while keeping the total tension as it was. And we modified that heavy compound catenary system in the section between Sendai and Kitakami to the system shown in Table 1. The contact wire’s weight was reduced and tension increased when modifying the existing system to the improved system (and respectively in Table 1). Changing the allocation of tension to each line of the system {{made it possible to}} modify withou...|$|R

30|$|After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, we {{performed}} a prospective study on all pediatric type I open fracture patients presenting to our institution between 2004 and 2008. The protocol described herein was initiated at our institution in 2004 for the non-operative management of these injuries. If a pediatric orthopedic fracture patient in the emergency department is found to have an open wound, the wound is evaluated by the resident physician or physician assistant on call. The wound is then measured and inspected in the patient’s emergency department room with <b>standard</b> <b>overhead</b> lighting to determine {{if it is a}} superficial abrasion or a full thickness breach of the skin. If the wound is full thickness, then it is evaluated as to whether it communicates with the fracture site or if it is remote and an independent injury. All full thickness wounds of ≤ 1  cm in size that are suspicious for communication with the fracture site are classified as type I open fractures in accordance with the Gustilo and Anderson [9] classification and the patients are started on the protocol (see Fig. 1).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the assumptions and equations behind a new spreadsheet-based cooling load design tool for underfloor air distribution (UFAD) systems {{developed by the}} Center for the Built Environment at University of California, Berkeley. After briefly reviewing previous UFAD design tools, we describe in detail how the design tool: a) transforms the zone design cooling load calculated for a <b>standard</b> <b>overhead</b> (OH) mixing system into the design cooling load for a stratified UFAD system, accounting for differences in design day cooling load profiles for OH and UFAD systems; b) splits the total UFAD cooling load into three fractions, supply plenum (SPF), zone, or room, (ZF), and return plenum (RPF); c) manages the thermal comfort in a vertically stratified environment; d) predicts the air temperature profiles and the setpoint temperature at the thermostat; e) models the air diffusers; f) predicts the design airflow rate; and g) models commonly used plenum configurations.

30|$|Cluster {{maintenance}} is done periodically by all clustering methods. The {{three types of}} events that trigger topology change in VANET {{can be defined as}} follows: a node joins the network, a node leaves the cluster, and two cluster heads come into direct communication range. If the new node, that joins the network, has non-clustered neighbors, then those nodes will form a new cluster according to the rules used by each clustering method. The overhead of cluster formation was explained earlier. However, if the new node has a neighbor that is a cluster-head, then it will try to join the cluster by sending a join message to the cluster-head, and this cluster <b>joining</b> <b>overhead</b> is same for all three methods (TB, PB and WB). When two neighboring clusters merge, the cluster-head with less number of members will lose its role and join the other cluster and become a cluster member. The losing node sends one message in one period to inform its members about its decision. If the losing node has cluster members, then the members are subject to cluster reorganization. The cluster members either join any nearby clusters or form a new cluster if they could not find a cluster to <b>join.</b> <b>Overhead</b> for <b>joining</b> any nearby clusters is the same for all three methods, and the overhead for cluster formation (cluster setup) is already presented before. The upper bound on the number of messages for cluster merging is equal to the average number of members per cluster, which is kTB, kWB and kPB for TB, WB and PB techniques respectively.|$|R
40|$|Standard, {{text-book}} based {{learning for}} earth, ocean, and atmospheric sciences {{has been limited}} by the unavailability of quantitative teaching materials. While a descriptive presentation, in a lecture format, of discrete satellite images is often adequate for high school classrooms, this is seldom the case at the undergraduate level. In order to address these concerns, a series of numerical exercises for the Macintosh was developed for use with satellite-derived Sea Surface Temperature, pigment and sea ice concentration data. Using {{a modified version of}} NIH Image, to analyze actual satellite data, students are able to better understand ocean processes, such as circulation, upwelling, primary production, and ocean/atmosphere coupling. Graphical plots, image math, and numerical comparisons are utilized to substantiate temporal and spatial trends in sea surface temperature and ocean color. Particularly for institutions that do not offer a program in remote sensing, the subject matter is presented as modular units, each of which can be readily incorporated into existing curricula. These materials have been produced in both CD-ROM and WWW format, making them useful for classroom or lab setting.
