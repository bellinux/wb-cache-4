Besides web pages, the web offers {{access to}} an immense va-riety of {{digitized}} source material, inventories and catalogues hosted by libraries and archives relevant for {{humanities and social sciences}} (HSS) studies.

The DAICA will support HSS studies by autonomously identifying appropriate resources and presenting topical investigation results.
