50|$|Dato Beach:Featuring white <b>sand,</b> <b>hermit</b> crabs, {{turquoise}} water, palm trees, spectacular vistas, and {{a staircase}} {{built into a}} volcanic rock outcropping, this beach has been less-frequented by locals in recent years due to superstitions stemming from the sinking of a ship {{and the death of}} all passengers aboard just offshore.|$|E
2500|$|The Sablon lies {{near the}} Mont des Arts neighbourhood, and lay not far outside the first city walls of Brussels. It was {{originally}} an unused open space, with areas of wetlands, grassland and <b>sand,</b> where a <b>hermit</b> made his home. The words sablon and zavel both mean a fine-grained sand, halfway between silt and sand. The Saint John Hospital ( [...] , [...] ) used {{the area as}} a cemetery in the thirteenth century, having run out of space in their own cemetery.|$|R
50|$|The {{marine life}} found here {{consists}} of anemones, urchins, sea cucumbers, and eels, which all {{live on the}} reefs along with turtles, conch and many varieties of marine fishes. The marine aquafauna is rich in conch, which has pearly-pink shells. Its meat is a favourite food supplement item and their shells are a collectors item. Other species of fish which are recorded close to the shore line in shallow waters are: sergeant majors, the blue chromis, brown chromis, surgeon fish; blue tangs and trumpet fish. On the shore are ghost crabs, which always live {{on the beach in}} small burrowed tunnels made in <b>sand,</b> and the <b>hermit</b> crabs, which live in land but lay eggs in water and which also eat garbage and sewerage. They spend some months in the sea during and after the hatching season.|$|R
