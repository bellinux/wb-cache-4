Built on a 1980s-inspired beat, the song's instrumentation includes old school synthesizers, 1980s-sounding drum kits wailing electric guitars, and horns. Music critics, including Jamie Peck of MTV noted that [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] {{was inspired by}} the prime work of Prince, particularly because of its lyrical content, the instruments used, and Knowles' style of singing on it. Lyrically, the song finds Knowles detailing her experiences as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> In the first verse, she employs guttural vocals to address many life lessons to [...] "20-somethings", [...] "30-somethings", [...] "40-somethings", and [...] "50-somethings". Knowles warns them against some consequences, affirming [...] "time really moves fast" [...] and that growing up fast will leave them wanting more.

500|$|Her father {{suffered}} from multiple sclerosis {{which had a}} profound emotional effect on her as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> She was determined {{to stay out of}} trouble and be a good student, which was what her father wanted for her. By sixth grade, Michelle joined a gifted class at Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy). She attended Whitney Young High School, Chicago's first magnet high school, established as a selective enrollment school, where she was a classmate of Jesse Jackson's daughter Santita. The round-trip commute from the Robinsons' South Side home to the Near West Side, where the school was located, took three hours. She recalled being fearful of how others would perceive her, but disregarded any negativity around her and used it [...] "to fuel me, to keep me going." [...] She recalled experiencing gender discrimination growing up, saying, for example, that rather than asking her for her opinion on a given subject, people commonly tended to ask what her older brother thought.

500|$|Described {{as one of}} [...] "R's most {{important}} artists" [...] during the 1990s, her second studio album, One in a Million, {{became one of the}} most influential R albums of the decade. Music critic Simon Reynolds cited [...] "Are You That Somebody?" [...] as [...] "the most radical pop single" [...] of 1998. Kelefah Sanneh of The New York Times wrote that rather than being the song's focal point, Aaliyah [...] "knew how to disappear into the music, how to match her voice to the bass line", and consequently [...] "helped change the way popular music sounds; the twitchy, beat-driven songs of Destiny's Child owe a clear debt to 'Are You That Somebody'." [...] Sanneh asserted that by the time of her death in 2001, Aaliyah [...] "had recorded some of the most innovative and influential pop songs of the last five years." [...] Music publication Popdust called Aaliyah an unlikely queen of the underground due mainly to her influence on the underground alternative music scene, which consists of heavy sampling and references to her music by underground artists. Popdust also mentioned that the forward-thinking music Aaliyah did with Timbaland and the experimental music being made by many underground alternative artists are somewhat cut from the same cloth. While compiling a list of artists that take cues from Aaliyah, MTV Hive mentioned that it's easy to spot her influence on underground movements like dubstep, strains of indie pop, and lo-fi R movements. With sales of 8.1 million albums in the United States and an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide, Aaliyah earned the nicknames [...] "Princess of R" [...] and [...] "Queen of Urban Pop", as she [...] "proved she was a muse in her own right". Ernest Hardy of Rolling Stone dubbed her as the [...] "undisputed queen of the midtempo come-on". Aaliyah has been referred to as a pop icon and a R icon for her impact and contributions to those respective genres. Japanese pop singer Hikaru Utada has said several times that [...] "It was when I heard Aaliyah's Age Ain't Nothing but a Number that I got hooked on R", after which Utada released her debut album First Love with heavy R influences. Another Japanese pop singer Crystal Kay has expressed how she admired Aaliyah when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> and how she would practice dancing while watching her music videos.|$|E

[...] She was probably familiar with the Wabanaki because they sold beaver, otter and bear skins to English traders like her father, in exchange for cloth and other imported goods. But despite the casual trade between the Wabanaki and English traders, there still existed mutual animosity and distrust between the two parties.|$|E

Mitchell also formed a duo with another Albury-based friend, Katherine Green, which was [...] "More along the lines of what I do on my own now, only a lot folkier.
