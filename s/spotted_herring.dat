50|$|Herklotsichthys punctatus, the spotback herring or <b>spotted</b> <b>herring,</b> is {{a species}} of herring from the family Clupeidae from the western Indian Ocean, the Red Sea and more {{recently}} the Levantine Sea in the eastern Mediterranean Sea by Lessepsian migration via the Suez Canal.|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of the gold <b>spot</b> <b>herring,</b> Herklotsichthys quadrimaculatus, is reported for Hawaii from the islands of Oahu, Molokai, and Lanai. This species was first collected in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, in 1975, and appears to have largely replaced the Marquesan sardine, Sardin ella marquesensis, introduced to Hawaii in the 1950 s. Notes on {{the separation of the}} gold <b>spot</b> <b>herring</b> from other Hawaiian clupeids are provided in addition to a comparison of the Hawaiian specimens with specimens of gold <b>spot</b> <b>herring</b> from Red Sea and tropical Pacific localities...|$|R

Biology of this protandrous hermaphrodite {{is presumed to}} be similar to that of Tenualosa ilisha, but the fewer gill rakers suggest an intake of larger species of zooplankton as food.|$|R

The high concentrations of blueback herring and alewife below the dam in the spring make it a popular fishing <b>spot</b> for <b>herring</b> gulls, great black-backed gulls, great blue herons, night herons and cormorants.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} {{birds of prey}} are broad-winged hawks and American kestrels, {{followed}} by red-tailed hawks, great horned owls, and barred owls. Water birds include the loon, great blue heron, common merganser, <b>spotted</b> sandpiper, and <b>herring</b> gull.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} rate of impingement of anadromous fish species, to relate how various physical and water quality parameters influence catch rates of individual intake systems, and to monitor the annual downstream migration of juvenile shad through the area of the seasonal pollution barrier. Frequency and abundance of catch was greatest at brackish water stations and least in upriver free-flowing zones. This indicates that the most important factor influencing catch is water intake location along the river system. A total of 97, 383 fish (38 species) were collected in 719 samples from 10 stations in the freshwater tidal zone. This represented 28. 8 % of total fish taken and 84. 8 % of the anadromous fish. Three brackish water stations produced 240, 409 fish (45 species in 370 samples. These collections comprised 71. 16 % of the total catch and 15. 17 % of the anadromous fish taken. Besides facility location, fish catch rates are influenced by dissolved oxygen levels, time of year, flooding conditions, light conditions, and tidal stage. During this study, the five most abundant species collected were menhaden, white perch, <b>spot,</b> blueback <b>herring,</b> and bay anchovy. Alewife and American shad ranked eighth and twelfth, respectively...|$|R
