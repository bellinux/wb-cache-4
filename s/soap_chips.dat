5000|$|Men {{and women}} were separated, with any {{children}} accompanying the women, into separate buildings, where they were stripped of all clothing and valuables. Clothing and valuables were steamed, while items like shoes, hats or belts, which might be damaged by steam were exposed to cyanogen gas. Attendants examined the nude persons for lice. If lice were found, men's hair was clipped close to the head and the clippings were burned. Women's hair was doused {{in a mixture of}} vinegar and kerosene, wrapped in a towel, and left on the hair for at least 30 minutes. If re-inspection indicated all nits had not been removed, the process was repeated. Once attendants declared the lice test had been [...] "passed", the naked people were gathered in a bathing area and sprayed with a liquid soap made of <b>soap</b> <b>chips</b> and kerosene oil. After collecting their sanitized clothing and dressing, incomers were evaluated by a foreman, vaccinated and given a certificate that they had completed the procedure. From the disinfecting area, migrants then entered the Immigration and Naturalization Service building for processing.|$|E
