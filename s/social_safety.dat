25|$|A {{comprehensive}} meta-analysis involving 86 studies {{indicated that}} involuntary job loss {{is linked to}} increased psychological distress.

25|$|Since the Great Depression, the Rhode Island Democratic Party has {{dominated}} local politics. Rhode Island has comprehensive {{health insurance for}} low-income children and a large <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> net. Many urban areas still have {{a high rate of}} children in poverty.

25|$|Progressive {{taxation}} reduces absolute {{income inequality}} when the higher rates on higher-income individuals are paid and not evaded, and transfer payments and <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> nets result in progressive government spending.

25|$|The economists Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty {{recommend}} {{much higher}} top marginal tax {{rates on the}} wealthy, up to 50 percent, or 70 percent or even 90 percent. Ralph Nader, Jeffrey Sachs, the United Front Against Austerity, among others, call for a financial transactions tax (also known as the Robin Hood tax) to bolster the <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> net and the public sector.|$|E
25|$|Public policy {{responses}} addressing {{causes and}} effects of income inequality in the US include: progressive tax incidence adjustments, strengthening <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> net provisions such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children, welfare, the food stamp program, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, organizing community interest groups, increasing and reforming higher education subsidies, increasing infrastructure spending, and placing limits on and taxing rent-seeking.|$|E
25|$|What {{caused the}} sizable deficit {{increases}} during {{and shortly after}} the Great Recession? The CBO reported that the deficit expansion was mainly due to the economic downturn rather than policy choices. Revenue fell while <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> net spending increased for programs such as unemployment compensation and food stamps, as more families qualified for benefits. From 2008 to 2009, the large deficit increase was also driven by spending on stimulus and bailout programs.|$|E

Democrat and Republican politicians also provided a series of recommendations for increasing median wages in December 2014. These included raising the minimum wage, infrastructure stimulus, and tax reform.|$|E
25|$|However, much {{empirical}} {{research in the}} field of happiness economics, such as that by Benjamin Radcliff, professor of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame, supports the contention that (at least in democratic countries) life satisfaction is strongly and positively related to the social democratic model of a generous <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> net, pro-worker labor market regulations, and strong labor unions. Similarly, there is evidence that public policies that reduce poverty and support a strong middle class, such as a higher minimum wage, strongly affects average levels of well-being.|$|E
25|$|By 2004, Peru had a {{far-reaching}} <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> net {{that included}} food programs serving 35 {{percent of the}} population, and work programs offering temporary employment to unskilled workers. The Cooperative Fund for Social Development funded projects to construct and improve schools, health clinics, rural roads, water and sanitation systems, and electric grids. Toledo placed food and infrastructure programs under the Ministry for Women and Social Development and urged that municipalities implement decentralization. Social safety-net spending in Peru remained well below the Latin American average under Toledo even as it covered {{a larger percentage of}} the population, which means that outlays were insufficient to lift many people up out of poverty.|$|E

25|$|In {{domestic}} politics the government tackled {{the world economic}} crisis by introducing currency controls, and through a comprehensive economic crisis package agreed with Venstre {{in the early months}} of 1933. At the same time a series of social reforms were carried out, which laid the earliest foundations that today's welfare state would be built upon. These reforms created a rudimentary <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> net, and did much to lessen the appeal of totalitarian and anti-democratic political movements during the crisis years. The government also enacted a new criminal code in 1930, which abolished capital punishment and de-criminalised homosexuality, and which, although amended many times, remains in force today.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{plentiful}} resources, {{the country}} lacks sustainable pragmatic policies to combat poverty. Hania Sholkamy, an {{economist for the}} Social Research Center at the American University in Cairo, disclosed that although the government had subsidized 270 million loaves of bread/day at 19 Piasters/piece, 29 {{percent of the children}} in Egypt remained malnourished. Although these policies were adopted in an attempt to reduce economic burdens on the poor, they benefited the rich more which caused more problems to the poor and increased the burdens of the government. In fact, 83 percent of food subsidy, 76 percent of electricity subsidy, 87 percent of petroleum subsidy and 76 percent of the <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> net subsidy went to the non-poor instead of the poor.|$|E
25|$|Equal {{economic}} opportunity, a base <b>social</b> <b>safety</b> net {{provided by}} the welfare state, and strong labor unions have historically been {{at the heart of}} Democratic economic policy. The welfare state supports a progressive tax system, higher minimum wages, social security, universal health care, public education, and public housing. They also support infrastructure development and government sponsored employment programs in an effort to achieve economic development and job creation, while stimulating private sector job creation. Additionally however, since the 1990s the party has at times supported centrist economic reforms, which cut the size of government and reduced market regulations. The party has continuously rejected laissez-faire economics as well as market socialism, instead favoring Keynesian economics within a capitalist market-based system.|$|E
