40|$|The moon offers {{particular}} {{advantages for}} interferometry, including a vacuum environment, a large stable base {{on which to}} assemble multi-kilometer baselines, and a cold nighttime temperature to allow for passive cooling of optics for high IR sensitivity. A baseline design for a Lunar Optical Interferometer (LOI) which exploits these features is presented. The instrument operates in the visible to mid-IL region, and is designed for both astrometry and synthesis imaging. The design uses a Y-shaped array of 12 <b>siderostats,</b> with maximum arm lengths of about 1 km. The inner <b>siderostats</b> are monitored in three dimensions from a central laser metrology structure to allow for high precision astrometry. The outer <b>siderostats,</b> used primarily for synthesis imaging, exploit the availability of bright reference stars {{in order to determine}} the instrument geometry. The path delay function is partitioned into coarse and fine components, the former accomplished with switched banks of range mirrors monitored with an absolute laser metrology system, and the latter with a short cat's eye delay line. The back end of the instrument is modular, allowing for beam combiners for astrometry, visible and IR synthesis imaging, and direct planet detection. With 1 m apertures, the instrument will have a point-source imaging sensitivity of about 29 mag; with the laser metrology system, astrometry at the microarcsecond level will be possible...|$|R
40|$|Installed at {{the heart}} of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), VINCI {{combines}} coherently the infrared light coming from two telescopes. The first fringes were obtained in March 2001 with the VLTI test <b>siderostats,</b> and in October of the same year with the 8 meters Unit Telescopes (UTs). After more than one year of operation, it is now possible to evaluate its behavior and performances with a relatively long timescale. During this period, the technical downtime has been kept to a very low level. The most important parameters of the instrument (interferometric efficiency, mechanical stability, [...] .) have been followed regularly, leading to a good understading of its performances and characteristics. In addition to a large number of laboratory measurements, more than 3000 on-sky observations have been recorded, giving a precise knowledge of the behavior of the system under various conditions. We report in this paper the main characteristics of the VINCI instrument hardware and software. The differences between observations with the <b>siderostats</b> and the UTs are also briefly discussed...|$|R

The reflected light from the <b>siderostat</b> is directed through a telescope which narrows the beam down to {{the diameter of the}} pipes, which is 12 cm. The light then hits the mirror of the NAT, which compensates for atmospheric effects and directs the light into the feed system.|$|E

40|$|In March 2001, the {{commissioning}} {{instrument of}} the VLTI, VINCI, succeeded in obtaining its first fringes by linking two 40 cm aperture <b>siderostats</b> on a 16 m baseline. During {{the first year of}} operation, thousands of interferometric observations on different baselines were carried out, with the technical goal of characterizing this complex system. We report in this paper these first measurements and estimate the main parameters of the atmospheric and internal turbulence along the complete light path. We first illustrate the degradation of the visibility accuracy caused by the differential piston and evaluate the contribution of the internal optical path fluctuations with respect to the atmospheric ones. The stability of the VLTI complex is demonstrated, which enabled us to record easily fringes with Unit Telescopes (UTs) on baselines as long as 102. 5 m (November 2001). In the last part, infrared measurements of the atmospheric differential piston are reported. They were obtained with the <b>siderostats</b> on two different baselines ranging from 16 m to 66 m.

The Data Flow System is the VLT {{end-to-end}} software system for handling astronomical observations from the initial observation proposal phase through the acquisition, processing {{and control of the}} astronomical data. The Data Flow System was first installed for VLTI first fringes utilising the <b>siderostats</b> together with the VINCI instrument and is constantly being upgraded in phase with the VLTI commissioning. When completed the VLT Interferometer will make it possible to coherently combine up to three beams coming from the four VLT 8. 2 m telescopes as well as from a set of initially three 1. 8 m Auxiliary Telescopes, using a Delay Line tunnel and four interferometry instruments. Observations of objects with some scientific interest are already being carried out in the framework of the VLTI commissioning using <b>siderostats</b> and the VLT Unit Telescopes, making it possible to test tools under realistic conditions. These tools comprise observation preparation, pipeline processing and further analysis systems. Work is in progress for the commissioning of other VLTI science instruments such as MIDI and AMBER. These are planned for the second half of 2002 and first half of 2003 respectively. The DFS will be especially useful for service observing. This is expected to be an important mode of observation for the VLTI, which is required to cope with numerous observation constraints and the need for observations spread over extended periods of time...|$|R

The goal of the mission {{is the study of}} Hot Jupiters ("pegasids"), brown dwarfs and the interior of protoplanetary disks. The design was developed by Centre National d'Études Spatiales and was studied for a launch as early as 2010-2012.

40|$|The Micro-Arcsecond Metrology (MAM) testbed is a {{ground-based}} system of optical and electronic equipment for testing components, systems, and engineering concepts for the Space Interferometer Mission (SIM) and similar future missions, in which optical interferometers will be operated in outer space. In addition, the MAM testbed {{is of interest}} {{in its own right}} as a highly precise metrological system. The designs of the SIM interferometer and the MAM testbed reflect a requirement to measure both the position of the starlight central fringe and the change in the internal optical path of the interferometer with sufficient spatial resolution to generate astrometric data with angular resolution at the microarcsecond level. The internal path is to be measured by use of a small metrological laser beam of 1, 319 -nm wavelength, whereas the position of the starlight fringe is to be estimated by use of a charge-coupled-device (CCD) image detector sampling a large concentric annular beam. For the SIM to succeed, the optical path length determined from the interferometer fringes must be tracked by the metrological subsystem to within tens of picometers, through all operational motions of an interferometer delay line and <b>siderostats.</b> The purpose of the experiments performed on the MAM testbed is to demonstrate this agreement in a large-scale simulation that includes {{a substantial portion of the}} system in the planned configuration for operation in outer space. A major challenge in this endeavor is to align the metrological beam with the starlight beam in order to maintain consistency between the metrological and starlight subsystems at the system level. The MAM testbed includes an optical interferometer with a white light source, all major optical components of a stellar interferometer, and heterodyne metrological sensors. The aforementioned subsystems are installed in a large vacuum chamber in order to suppress atmospheric and thermal disturbances. The MAM is divided into two distinct subsystems: the test article (TA), which is the interferometer proper, and the inverse interferometer pseudo-star (IIPS), which synthesizes the light coming from a distant target star by providing spatially coherent wavefronts out of two mirrors, separated by the MAM baseline, that feed directly into two <b>siderostats</b> that are parts of the TA. The two feed mirrors of the IIPS are articulated (in translation and tilt) in order to simulate stars located at different orientations in space, while still illuminating the TA <b>siderostats.</b> The spectrum of the simulated starlight of the IIPS corresponds to that of a blackbody at a temperature of about 3, 100 K...|$|R

The enhanced array will also employ adaptive optics techniques. This layout and increased sparse aperture will permit significant improvements to the science capability, from a tenfold increase in measuring ever-fainter wide-angle astrometry targets, to improved positional determination for numerous binary and flare stars. When the 1.8m telescope addition are complete, NPOI also will undertake additional studies of dust and proto-planetary disks, and planetary systems and their formation.|$|E

It {{is located in}} the Paul Wild Observatory, 20 km west of Narrabri town in New South Wales, Australia. The interferometer has several siderostats, which collect and reflect starlight into the optical laboratory for interferometry via two vacuum pipes. Although mirrors at the siderostats are 20 cm in diameter, the effective aperture size is 14 cm as they are operated at angles of about 45°. By selecting the different siderostats at different distances the baseline of the interferometer can be varied from 5m and 640m. Since not all the <b>siderostat</b> stations are equipped with mirrors at present, the maximum usable baseline of the interferometer is 160m.

Simulation models for both FSUs are developed with Matlab. Instrumental parameters, i. e. phase, transmission, visibility, are tabulated for ease of maintenance and to speed execution time. For the use of <b>siderostats,</b> due to fast turbulence, the need for intensity calibration arises.

Reynolds and colleagues, including Matt Haffner, a senior scientist in UW-M's astronomy department, later developed WHAM. WHAM formally began life at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) in November 1996, using the flat mirrors of a two axis, all-sky <b>siderostat</b> passing light horizontally through a 0.6 m diameter, 8.6 m focal length objective lens into a 2.5 m x 2.5 m x 6 m trailer that contained the spectrometer, that used a low noise, high efficiency CCD camera as a multichannel detector behind a pair of 15 cm diameter Fabry-Perot etalons/spectrometers. The system was automated, so that the entire WHAM facility, including opening and closing {{at the beginning and}} end of the observing night, was operated from a campus office at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.
