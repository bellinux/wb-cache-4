40|$|Mg-Li based alloys {{are widely}} applied in various {{engineering}} applications. The strength of these alloys is modified and enhanced by different <b>strengthening</b> mechanisms. The <b>strengthening</b> mechanisms of these alloys and their composites have been extensively studied {{during the past}} decades. Important mechanisms applied to <b>strengthening</b> the alloys include precipitation <b>strengthening,</b> solution <b>strengthening,</b> grain and subgrain <b>strengthening,</b> and dislocation density <b>strengthening.</b> Precipitation and solution <b>strengthening</b> mechanisms are strongly dependent on composition of the alloys and thermal treatment processes, whereas grain and subgrain and dislocation density <b>strengthening</b> mechanisms majorly depend on thermomechanical processing. In this paper, recent studies on conventional processes for the <b>strengthening</b> of Mg-Li based alloys are summarized as they are critical during the alloys design and processing.

This raise {{the importance of}} the maintenance, rehabilitation, and <b>strengthening</b> of reinforced concrete members. Several techniques have been used to <b>strengthen</b> these structures around the world. External post-tensioning is one of the widely used <b>strengthening</b> techniques in many countries due to its advantages over other <b>strengthening</b> methods. Although flexural <b>strengthening</b> of existing structural members is a very well established method, shear <b>strengthening</b> of structural members, especially with existing shear cracks has attained very little attention from researchers.

40|$|This study {{compares the}} changes in pathway and center of gravity (COG) on the calcaneus of non-{{involved}} and involved sides according to eccentric and concentric <b>strengthening</b> in patients with unilateral Achilles tendinopathy. The goal was to define the biomechanical changes according to eccentric <b>strengthening</b> {{for the development of}} clinical guidelines. Eighteen patients with Achilles tendinopathy were recruited at the K Rehabilitation Hospital in Seoul. The subjects were instructed to perform 5 sessions of concentric <b>strengthening.</b> The calcaneal pathway was measured using a three-dimensional (3 D) motion analyzer, and COG was measured by a force plate. Subsequently, eccentric <b>strengthening</b> was implemented, and identical variables were measured. Concentric and eccentric <b>strengthening</b> was carried out on both the involved and non-involved sides. There {{was no significant difference in}} the calcaneal pathway in patients with Achilles tendinopathy during concentric and eccentric <b>strengthening.</b> However, during eccentric <b>strengthening,</b> the calcaneal pathway significantly increased on the involved side compared to the non-involved side for all variables excluding the z-axis. COG significantly decreased on the involved side when compared to the non-involved side in patients with Achilles tendinopathy during eccentric and concentric <b>strengthening.</b> During concentric <b>strengthening,</b> all variables of the COG significantly increased on the involved side compared to the non-involved side. Compared with eccentric <b>strengthening,</b> concentric <b>strengthening</b> decreased the stability of ankle joints and increased the movement distance of the calcaneus in patients with Achilles tendinopathy. Furthermore, eccentric <b>strengthening</b> was verified to be an effective exercise method for prevention of Achilles tendinopathy through the reduction of forward and backward path length of foot pressure.
