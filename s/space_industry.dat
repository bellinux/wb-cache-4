Akiyama gave a daily TV broadcast from orbit and also performed scientific experiments for Russian and Japanese companies.

500|$|In 1968, {{after the}} Rockets won a coin toss against the Baltimore Bullets to {{determine}} who would have the first overall pick in the 1968 NBA draft, they selected Elvin Hayes from the University of Houston. Hayes improved the Rockets' record to 37 wins and 45 losses, enough for the franchise's first ever playoff appearance in 1969, but the Rockets lost in the semi-finals of the Western Division to the Atlanta Hawks, four games to two. Despite the additions of Calvin Murphy and Rudy Tomjanovich and the management of Hall of Fame coach Alex Hannum, the Rockets tallied a 67–97 record in the following two seasons and {{did not make the}} playoffs in either season. Because of the low performance and attendance, Breitbard looked to sell the team, and in 1971, Texas Sports Investments bought the franchise for $5.6million, and moved the team to Houston.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to understand why the pace of technical change has been slower in the defense and <b>space</b> <b>industries</b> than in semiconductors. To answer this question, we adopt an inductive method that exploits historical facts and patent statistics to provide empirical data. Basing our rationale on the appropriation and structural inertia arguments, we show that the constraints imposed by reliability in the defense and <b>space</b> <b>industries</b> impedes the appropriation of supra profits from innovation and thus slows the pace of technical change. The main managerial implication of this result is that technical inertia contributes to competitive success when the reliability constraint reaches high levels.

2500|$|The {{flight and}} ground-testing {{software}} also required research. In 1983 the Buran developers {{estimated that the}} software development would require several thousand programmers if done with their existing methodology (in assembly language), and they appealed to Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics for assistance. It was decided {{to develop a new}} high-level [...] "problem-oriented" [...] programming language. Researchers at Keldysh developed two languages: [...] PROL2 (used for real-time programming of onboard systems) and DIPOL (used for the ground-based test systems), as well as the development and debugging environment SAPO PROLOGUE. There was also an operating system known as Prolog Manager. Work on these languages continued beyond the end of the Buran project, with PROL2 being extended into SIPROL, and eventually all three languages developed into DRAKON which is still in use in the Russian <b>space</b> <b>industry.</b> A declassified May 1990 CIA report citing open-source intelligence material states that the software for the Buran spacecraft was written in [...] "the French-developed programming language known as Prolog", possibly due to confusion with the name PROLOGUE.|$|E

The range of these first missiles was only [...] By 1959 Soviet {{scientists and engineers}} developed new technology, and as a result, the [...] "Southern" [...] design office (KBYu – as abbreviated in Russian) started a new machine-building project making ballistic missiles. [...] Under the leadership of Yangel, KBYu produced such powerful rocket engines that the range of these ballistic missiles was practically without limits. During the 1960s, these powerful rocket engines were used as launch vehicles for the first Soviet space ships. During Makarov’s directorship, Yuzhmash designed and manufactured four generations of missile complexes of different types. These included space launch vehicles Kosmos, Tsyklon-2, Tsyklon-3 and Zenit. Under the leadership of Yangel’s successor, V. Utkin, the KBYu created a unique space-rocket system called Energia-Buran. Yuzhmash engineers manufactured 400 technical devices that were launched in artificial satellites (Sputniks). For {{the first time in}} the world <b>space</b> <b>industry,</b> the Dnipropetrovsk missile plant organised the serial production of space Sputniks. By the 1980s, this plant manufactured 67 different types of space ships, 12 space research complexes and 4 defense space rocket systems.|$|E
2500|$|Nations {{that want}} to become a full member of ESA do so in 3 stages. First a Cooperation Agreement is signed between the country and ESA. In this stage, the country has very limited {{financial}} responsibilities. If a country wants to co-operate more fully with ESA, it signs a European Cooperating State (ECS) Agreement. The ECS Agreement makes companies based in the country eligible for participation in ESA procurements. The country can also participate in all ESA programmes, except for the Basic Technology Research Programme. While the financial contribution of the country concerned increases, it is still much lower than that of a full member state. The agreement is normally followed by a Plan For European Cooperating State (or PECS Charter). This is a 5-year programme of basic research and development activities aimed at improving the nation's <b>space</b> <b>industry</b> capacity. At the end of the 5-year period, the country can either begin negotiations to become a full member state or an associated state or sign a new PECS Charter.
