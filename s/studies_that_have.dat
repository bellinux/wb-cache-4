5|$|EFS regulates T-cell {{function}} and maturation, preventing expansion of autoreactive clones and pathological immune responses. Two <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> reported that EFS expression in medullar thymus epithelial cells {{is important for}} negative selection of T-cells during their development, which implies an important role of EFS in maintaining immune homeostasis and autoimmunity prevention. In these studies, mice with defective EFS progressed normally during embryogenesis but then developed massive inflammatory lesions in multiple tissues that bore a striking histological resemblance to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease. Mechanistically, EFS expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is crucial for their functional maturation and growth factor-mediated expansion. mTECs are important for proper T-cell maturation and negative selection of autoreactive clones, required for development of immunological self-tolerance.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} modern <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> {{supported}} the original autopsy finding. In a 2008 study, researchers analysed samples of Napoleon's hair from throughout his life, {{as well as}} samples from his family and other contemporaries. All samples had high levels of arsenic, approximately 100 {{times higher than the}} current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy, and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives. Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning, and confirmed evidence of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer as the cause of death.|$|E

This study presents the method with the limits of the existing <b>study</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> uniformly been customizing the method in system architecture.

25|$|Human {{bisexuality}} has mainly {{been studied}} alongside homosexuality. Van Wyk and Geist {{argue that this}} is a problem for sexuality research because the few <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> observed bisexuals separately have found that bisexuals are often different from both heterosexuals and homosexuals. Furthermore, bisexuality does not always represent a halfway point between the dichotomy. Research indicates that bisexuality is influenced by biological, cognitive and cultural variables in interaction, and this leads to different types of bisexuality.|$|E

25|$|Ultra-rapid visual {{categorization}} {{is a model}} proposing {{an automatic}} feedforward mechanism that forms high-level object representations in parallel without focused attention.

Evidence for a feedforward mechanism {{can be found in}} <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> shown that many neurons are already highly selective {{at the beginning of a}} visual response, thus suggesting that feedback mechanisms are not required for response selectivity to increase. Furthermore, recent fMRI and ERP studies have shown that masked visual stimuli that participants do not consciously perceive can significantly modulate activity in the motor system, thus suggesting somewhat sophisticated visual processing.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{majority}} of studies on bilingual sentence processing are focused on L2 processing, {{there are still a}} few <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> investigated cross-language activation during their native language (L1) reading. For example, van Assche et al. replicated the cognate effect in L1 with Dutch-English bilinguals, and found that a non-dominant language may affect native-language sentence reading, both at earliest and at later reading stages. Titone et al. observed this cross-language activation in English-French bilinguals at early reading stages only when the L2 was acquired early in life. They also concluded that the semantic constraint provided by a sentence can attenuate cross-language activation at later reading stages.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{the premise}} that {{education}} is a fundamental factor in the regional integration process, educational courses at the primary or junior high level, provided that they do not entail technical studies, will be recognized by member states as being on the same level for all member nations.
