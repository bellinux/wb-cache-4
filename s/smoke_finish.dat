In private they joke, chain <b>smoke,</b> and <b>finish</b> each other's thoughts, while maintaining the public front of Zondi as [...] "kaffir" [...] or [...] "boy." [...] In The Artful Egg Kramer calculates the number of times each has saved the life of the other to be 15.|$|R

Billy is bitterly disappointed not to have won, especially since without a winning purse Red can't afford to race again. To Billy's delight, in a show of great sportsmanship, the winner insists officials give the trophy to Billy for his bravery.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1920s saloon bodies were first offered; {{previously}} all cars had been tourers. The bodies had, since {{the move to}} Bishopsgate Green, been made in Coventry by the company itself, {{but it was not}} until 1922 that they were mass-produced, using a wooden track along which they were pushed by hand. The company was justifiably proud of the modern factory at Canley, boasting in its advertisements [...] "It is a beautifully lighted and well-aired factory standing on the edge of a breezy common away from the city din and <b>smoke,</b> that the <b>finishing</b> touches and test are given to the All British 'Standard' Light cars which issue there to almost every quarter in the world".|$|R
500|$|At 10:10 Lieutenant Commander Gerard Broadmead Roope, fired five torpedoes {{from one}} {{mounting}} {{at a range}} of , but all missed because Captain Hellmuth Heye had kept Hippers bow pointed at Glowworm throughout the battle to minimize his risk from torpedoes. The destroyer fell back through her smoke screen to buy time to get her second torpedo mount working, but Heye followed Glowworm through the <b>smoke</b> to <b>finish</b> her off before she could fire {{the rest of her}} torpedoes. The two ships were very close when Hipper emerged from the smoke and Roope ordered a hard turn to starboard to reduce the range and possibly ram the cruiser. Hipper was slow to answer her helm and Glowworm struck the cruiser just [...] the anchor. The collision broke off Glowworms bow {{and the rest of the}} ship scraped along Hippers side, gouging open several holes in the latter's hull and destroying her forward starboard torpedo mounting. One German sailor was knocked overboard by the collision. Hipper took on some [...] of water before the leaks could be isolated, but was not seriously damaged. Glowworm was on fire when she drifted clear and her boilers exploded at 10:24, taking 109 of her crew with her.|$|R
50|$|Nicotine {{dependence}} is {{a complex}} construct and therefore {{it is challenging to}} measure. When it comes to assessing nicotine dependence, how one chooses to define it and/or the purpose of the assessment will guide which assessment to use. Some people distinguish between nicotine dependence and addiction, but, for the most part, nicotine dependence instruments ask about ideas that are thought of to be dependence and addiction. Thus the two terms are now often used interchangeably. For instance, someone could use a narrow definition of nicotine dependence that focused on physical dependence characterized as neuroadaptations—changes in the brain—produced by repeated smoking. This would lead them to use one type of assessment. On the other hand, someone could want to include other components such as the influence of cues in the environment that are now linked to smoking and lead to urges to <b>smoke</b> (e.g., <b>finishing</b> a meal, seeing someone smoke) or the degree to which smokers feel they have lost control over their smoking. These constructs are typically thought to be related to addiction but they are included in some dependency assessments. Below are three of the major types of nicotine dependence assessments: physical dependence assessments, clinical assessments, and multidimensional assessments. Each type varies in how nicotine dependence is defined and assessed.|$|R

60|$|While thus engaged, an old sailor on a chest {{just under}} me was puffing out volumes of tobacco <b>smoke.</b> My supper <b>finished,</b> he brushed {{the stem of}} his sooty pipe against {{the sleeve of his}} frock, and politely waved it toward me. The {{attention}} was sailor-like; as for the nicety of the thing, no man who has lived in forecastles is at all fastidious; and so, after a few vigorous whiffs to induce repose, I turned over and tried my best to forget myself. But in vain. My crib, instead of extending fore and aft, as it should have done, was placed athwart ships, that is, at right angles to the keel, and the vessel, going before the wind, rolled to such a degree, that-every time my heels went up and my head went down, I thought I was on the point of turning a somerset. Beside this, there were still more annoying causes of inquietude; and {{every once in a while}} a splash of water came down the open scuttle, and flung the spray in my face.|$|R
2500|$|The Chase-Opening race at Chicagoland Speedway {{started with}} {{qualifying}} being rained-out and Kyle Busch starting on Pole {{for being the}} fastest in first practice, and Chase Seed #1 Brad Keselowski wound up starting 25th for the 267 lap event. Busch led 46 laps early on, but the race saw comers and goers as it saw only a few cautions for the first 3/4 of the event. Jeff Gordon, Jamie McMurray, Keselowski, and Kevin Harvick (who led a race-high 79 laps) took turns at the front {{over the course of}} 100 laps of green. Keselowski and Harvick both suffered loose wheels and had to start at the tail-end of the lead lap. Chase driver Aric Almirola was leading on series of green flag pit stops with 30 to go when his engine blew and was forced to retire. Rookie Kyle Larson wound up taking the lead in the late going with a superior machine, battling Harvick, Gordon, and Keselowski in the late going with Keselowski making a three-wide move in between Larson and Harvick, taking the lead for good. With less than 10 laps to go, the final caution came out after Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. and Danica Patrick got together in Turn 4. On the final restart, Keselowski got away easy, Harvick fell to 5th, and Keselowski the #1 seed scored his 5th win of the season and second at Chicagoland. Gordon beat Larson for 2nd, and Joey Logano blew up out of Turn 4, but streaked across the finish line up in <b>smoke</b> to <b>finish</b> 4th. “I don’t really know what happened," [...] Keselowski said. [...] "I just know we got to the lead. I saw Kyle and Kevin racing each other really hard, they were aggressively side drafting and I was waiting for an opportunity to strike and it came. The car stuck and everything came together." ...|$|R
