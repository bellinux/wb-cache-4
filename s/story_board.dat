5|$|In 2012, Booker and tech {{executives}} Sarah Ross and Nathan Richardson formed Waywire, {{a company}} focused on video sharing technology. Early investors included Oprah Winfrey, Eric Schmidt, Jeff Weiner, and Troy Carter. After Booker's relationship to Waywire was discussed in a front-page New York Times <b>story,</b> <b>board</b> member Andrew Zucker {{stepped down from}} his position. Shortly thereafter, Waywire CEO Nathan Richardson departed the business as the company shifted its focus from content creation to content curation. In August 2013, Booker told NBC News he intended to resign from the Waywire board and put his holdings in a trust if elected to the Senate; by September, he had resigned his place {{on the board and}} donated his share of the company to charity. Waywire was sold to another video curation business the following month.|$|E
25|$|Bill Krohn {{has noted}} that Bass's 48 <b>story</b> <b>board</b> panels for the scene {{introduced}} all the key aspects of the final shower murder scene – most notably, {{the fact that the}} attacker appears as a silhouette, close-ups of a slashing knife, the shower curtain torn down, a shot of the shower head from below, Marion's desperate outstretched arm, and the famous shot of the transition from the drain hole of the bathtub to Marion Crane's dead eye. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of Bass's iris titles for Vertigo. Krohn also concludes that Bass did not literally direct the shower scene, proving Hitchcock's presence on the set throughout the shooting of that scene.|$|E

As the singer cannot understand this relationship, and faces the disapproval of her mother because of it, Farmer decides to commit suicide by throwing herself {{from the top of}} a cliff. The <b>story</b> <b>board</b> was even presented in the media, but Farmer's recording company RCA did not agree with to the project, especially since this video would have cost 70,000 euro to make. There was no video for [...] "My Mum Is Wrong".|$|E

He hired Hollywood special effects experts Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma, who had both previously worked on such films as Independence Day, Godzilla and Sky Captain, to help create the visual effects for the film. Roshan also hired Hong Kong action director Tony Ching after admiring his work in Hero. Before production began, Hrithik Roshan went to China to train with Ching for the cable work that {{would be needed to}} make his character [...] "fly". A <b>story</b> <b>board</b> of the film was prepared and sent to Ching to help him develop the action sequences.|$|E
500|$|Prior to filming, {{director}} Guillem Morales {{worked hard}} on a <b>story</b> <b>board.</b> For Shearsmith, the small space added {{to the need to}} meticulously plan the production process; he explained that every shot was worked out in advance. The set, which was situated in Twickenham Studios for the filming, was shaken manually by an assistant director to create the effect of motion; something which surprised Hesmondhalgh. The production crew filmed the episode by removing walls from the [...] "carriage" [...] one at a time, and shooting from the various angles, meaning that they had to effectively dismantle and reassemble the set five times. Benton noted that the tight space created a challenge for the camera crews, but, for the actors, it was [...] "great".|$|E

Prior to [...] "The Only Exception" [...] video, Chesbro had been approached to direct music videos for Brand New Eyes two previous singles, but decided against it due to creative opinions. In December 2009, he was asked to direct the music video for [...] "The Only Exception". Although the <b>story</b> <b>board</b> process took a while, the video was filmed in four days. The music video premiered on February 17, 2010, on Paramore's website. Williams confirmed that as part of a Valentine's Day theme, the band selected cards that were sent to them by fans and featured them in the video. In an interview with MTV, Chesbro commented on filming the scene involving Williams lying on Valentine's Day's styled-cards during the music video, saying, ...|$|E

500|$|The {{script for}} [...] "All Souls" [...] {{was written by}} John Shiban and Frank Spotnitz, and {{directed}} by Allen Coulter. The original genesis for the episode was an idea developed by Dan Angel and Billy Brown, two <b>story</b> <b>board</b> editors for the series that had left after Christmas of 1997. In this incarnation, the plot was radically different; according to Shiban, the story was [...] "about Mulder and Scully and angels, but it never quite worked {{the way it was}} originally conceived." [...] Shiban and Spotnitz decided to over-haul the script and feature elements of the earlier [...] "Christmas Carol" [...] and [...] "Emily" [...] story arc. The episode, according to Andy Meisler, thus became the unofficial third part in the story. Shiban and Spotnitz wanted to include the [...] "very universal" [...] idea of Scully exploring feelings for her deceased daughter. In addition, by making Scully the believer and Mulder the skeptic, the writers added [...] "the Mulder-Scully criss-cross" [...] that was a major theme for the fifth season.|$|E

40|$|Current {{object-oriented}} modeling methods {{focus on}} the specification of the static structure of software objects and their interaction at runtime. A major deficiency of these methods {{is that they do}} not provide sufficient means to specify the behaviour of object structures. In this paper we propose a novel high-level, graphical method called Story Driven modeling (SDM). SDM employs so called <b>story</b> <b>boards</b> to analyse the dynamics of object structures as sequences of graphical snap shots for sample scenarios. A major benefit of this approach is that <b>story</b> <b>boards</b> allow to develop and illustrate design and ideas of a systems object structure and central mechanisms in a simple visual notation. On the other hand, <b>story</b> <b>boards</b> have well-defined syntax and semantics that gives way to semi-automatic derivation of subsequent specifications like e. g. the static class hierarchy and dynamic operations on object structures. For the latter, SDM employs a high-level, graphical formalism called story diagrams, which is based on the theory of programmed graph rewriting systems. In this paper we illustrate SDM with a sample case study which is the development of the bus route information system of Paderborn...|$|R
