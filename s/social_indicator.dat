Lewis 3 This review synthesizes {{some of the main}} themes of <b>social</b> sustainability <b>indicators</b> for forest management, and addresses conceptual categories, issues, and limitations {{associated with the use of}} <b>social</b> <b>indicators.</b> Socio-cultural values and conditions associated with quality of life, public access to non-market benefits and resources, governance, and community stability are discussed. The paper illustrates how a selection of <b>social</b> <b>indicators</b> has been prescribed and used within various sustainable forest management (sfm) systems of criteria and indicators (c&i) at different scales from the international to the local in British Co-lumbia. <b>Social</b> <b>indicators</b> are, in general, weakly developed relative to ecological and economic indicators. Standard c&i systems often omit crucial <b>social</b> <b>indicators,</b> or include them without specific definitions or measurable benchmarks. Recommendations are made for future research that examines the fundamental nature of <b>social</b> <b>indicators</b> and their underlying cause-and-effect relationships, and supports improved methods and tools for integrating <b>social</b> <b>indicators</b> into forest management and decision making.

In this response paper, we join in the discussion by highlighting five issues—progress, paradigms, puzzles, promise, and potential research directions of <b>social</b> <b>indicators</b> research. In terms of progress, while we have accomplished many tasks proposed by Solomon et al. (The quality of life, Sage, London 1980), some of them are yet to be achieved. Regarding research paradigms surrounding <b>social</b> <b>indicators,</b> researchers have primarily used positivistic or post-positivistic orientation to conduct and interpret <b>social</b> <b>indicators</b> research, with relatively fewer studies using interpretive, constructionist or critical theory perspective. There are also several puzzles deserving consideration. These include (a) the use of “other types of evidence”, particularly qualitative data; (b) evaluation of social programs; (c) feasibility of assessing “social progress”; (d) choice of social indicators; (e) interpretation of findings; (f) methodological debates; and (g) explanations for social change.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a synopsis on <b>social</b> <b>indicators</b> as relevant to cumulative effects assessment {{and land use}} planning. Although much {{has been done to}} better understand the social dimensions of environmental assessment, empirical work has been lacking on <b>social</b> <b>indicators</b> that could be used either as measurable inputs or outputs for cumulative effects assessment and land use planning in different kinds of communities and regions. Cumulative effects models currently in practice often fail to address deeper issues of community and regional well-being. Against this gap, social scientists are being asked to make reliable generalizations about functional, measurable relationships between certain <b>social</b> <b>indicators</b> and land use change or scenarios. To address this challenge, the Alberta Research Council held a two-day workshop in 2005 with social scientists. The workshop resulted in a list of prioritized <b>social</b> <b>indicators</b> that could be included in cumulative effects modeling/assessments and land use planning. The top five <b>social</b> <b>indicators</b> included population growth rate, education attainment, self-assessed quality of life, equity, i. e., distribution of benefits, and locus of control. Although consensus on <b>social</b> <b>indicators</b> and <b>social</b> thresholds for cumulative effects models was not reached, the insight gained from the workshop will help inform future cumulative effects assessment and land use planning...|$|R

50|$|Opponents of this {{practice}} {{argue that it}} forces teachers to limit curriculum to a set range of knowledge or skills {{in order to increase}} student performance on the mandated test. This produces an unhealthy focus on excessive repetition of simple, isolated skills ("drill and kill") and limits the teacher's ability to focus on a holistic understanding of the subject matter. With high stakes testing impeding over every decision a teacher makes, they are often forced to teach to the tests rather than to their students. Teaching to the test entails instruction devoid of passion and meaning as students are taught information from a stripped-down curriculum. This would be an incidence of Campbell's law, the general principle that a <b>social</b> <b>indicator</b> distorts the process it is intended to monitor. Furthermore, opponents argue, teachers who engage in it are typically below-average teachers. Some research suggests that teaching to the test is ineffective and often does not achieve its primary goal of raising student scores.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} inequalities as pointed out by Amartya Sen: {{educational}} inequality and health inequality. These are the indicators of a woman's status of welfare. In India irrespective of the caste, creed, religion and social status, the overall status of a woman is lower than men and therefore a male child is preferred over a female child. A male child is considered a blessing and his birth is celebrated {{as opposed to a}} female child where her birth is not celebrated and is considered more of a burden. Therefore, education and health care of the female child in India is an important <b>social</b> <b>indicator</b> to measure equality between men and women. According to the 2001 Indian census, overall male-female ratio was 927 females per 1000 males. However, the 2011 Indian census shows that there are 914 females per 1000 males.During the last decade the number of female children to male children in the youngest age group fell from 945 per 1000 males to 927 females per 1000 males.|$|E

5000|$|Campbell's law is an adage {{developed}} by Donald T. Campbell, {{a psychologist and}} social scientist who often wrote about research methodology. The law states [...] "The more any quantitative <b>social</b> <b>indicator</b> is used for social decision-making, the more subject {{it will be to}} corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor." [...] (p. 85) On a similar note, Campbell also wrote:achievement tests may well be valuable indicators of general school achievement under conditions of normal teaching aimed at general competence. But when test scores become the goal of the teaching process, they both lose their value as indicators of educational status and distort the educational process in undesirable ways. (Similar biases of course surround the use of objective tests in courses or as entrance examinations.)Campbell's law can be seen {{as an example of the}} cobra effect. The social science principle of Campbell's law is sometimes used to point out the negative consequences of high-stakes testing in U.S. classrooms. This may take the form of teaching to the test or outright cheating. An example is [...] "The High-Stakes Education Rule" [...] as described in the Learning-Disadvantage Gap.|$|E

It quickly become {{a marker of}} social advancement and openness to more modern and liberal values.From independence, the country gradually became Arabized even if the administration, justice and education had long been bilingual, while the knowledge of European languages has been enhanced by exposure of Tunisia to the continent through television. Visas were introduced by the French minister Charles Pasqua in 1986 for population movements between Tunisia and France. In October 1999, commercial establishments are forced to give twice the space for Arabic characters as Latin characters. At the same time, the administration of Tunisia is forced to communicate only in Arabic but only the departments of Defense and Justice and the legislature are actually fully Arabized. Like many other documents produced by the administration, the Official Journal of the Republic of Tunisia, which enacts laws and decrees, is written in Arabic but is translated in French, although this version has no legal value {{and can not be}} considered official. In this context, the use of French seemed to be on the decline despite the increased number of graduates of the educational system, which leads to the fact that much of French remains an important <b>social</b> <b>indicator.</b> Since it is widely practiced in the business, the medical world and cultural world, we can even consider that it has gentrified.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a short {{summary of the}} most common statistical fallacies found in public debates employing <b>social</b> <b>indicator</b> data as the evidentiary premises of arguments about politics and public affairs. The purpose is to offer students a convenient framework for evaluating, and developing their own, arguments relying on <b>social</b> <b>indicator</b> data. 1. Statistical Fallacies in <b>Social</b> <b>Indicator</b> Arguments Most data-based public affairs writing involves informal logic and argumentation. Since Aristotle, the generally accepted method of evaluating informal arguments has been to analyze them for common forms of fallacious reasoning. “Statistical ” fallacies occur when an argument’s conclusions are not supported by the numerical evidence provided as premises. Several of the statistical fallacies commonly found in analyses of <b>social</b> <b>indicator</b> data analysis are forms of the “threats to internal and external validity ” identified in the work of Donald T. Campbell and Julian Stanley (1966) on quasi-experimental design. Several of Campbell’s threats, such as sample mortality, testing, and Hawthorne effects, are not common in <b>social</b> <b>indicator</b> arguments (in part because such data do not involve repeated measurements of the same sample) and other statistical fallacies are peculiar to the interpretation of <b>social</b> <b>indicator</b> measurements. Statistical fallacies fall roughly into two categories: those related primarily to the measurement and the collection and construction of the <b>social</b> <b>indicator</b> being used and those related to causation. One statistical fallacy, perhaps the most common in public debate using social policy indicators, can involve data misinterpretation related to both measurement and causation: Cherry Picking.
