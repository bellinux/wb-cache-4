40|$|Background. We present our {{experience}} with transnasal endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy. Patients and methods. We treated 95 patients with lacrimal duct insufficiency from June 2000 to February 2003.  The most frequent cause of nasolacrimal duct obstruction was chronic inflammation. We inserted a light probe through the inferior canalliculus to transilluminate {{the area of}} the lacrimal sac. We anaemized the region over the lacrimal sac and the attachment of the middle nasal concha and corrected nasal septum deviation were indicated. We coagulated and removed the mucosa over the transilluminated area, the bony wall and the medial portion of the lacrimal sac. After haemostasis, we placed <b>silicone</b> <b>tubes</b> through both canalliculi and fixed its ends with metallic clips. We finally introduced a Merocel tampon in the middle nasal meatus for two days. The <b>silicone</b> <b>tubes</b> remained in place for 3 to 4 months. Results. We observed no serious complications. The <b>silicone</b> <b>tubes</b> remained in place for 3 to 4 months. Follow up period ranged from 8 to 40 months. We noticed recurrence of symptoms in seven patients. Conclusions. Transnasal endoscopic DCR is a contribution to the development of endoscopic surgery technique. Its success rate is comparable to or even better than external DCR, according to other and our own study. Transnasal endoscopic DCR is a simple and successful procedure and well tolerated by the patients. </p...|$|R

50|$|In urinary {{catheterization}} a latex, polyurethane, or <b>silicone</b> <b>tube</b> {{known as}} a urinary catheter is inserted into a patient's bladder via the urethra.

5000|$|There are {{a variety}} of methods for {{grafting}} vegetable crops. Cleft grafting occurs when a V-shape is cut into the rootstock and a complementing wedge-shaped scion is inserted. The graft is then held with a small clip until healing occurs. [...] Approach grafting involves notching opposing sides of the stems of the rootstock and scion, and then using a clip to hold the stems together while they fuse. Once the graft has healed, the original scion is then cut off of the desired rootstock and the unused rootstock is detached from the scion. [...] Micrografting is a new technique that has been recently integrated into micropropagation production for hybrid tomato. This method uses micropropagated scion shoots that grafted onto 3 week-old rootstock seedlings. The most common commercial technique for grafting tomato is tube grafting. Tube grafting takes place when the scion and rootstock are severed as seedlings and reattached with a small, <b>silicone</b> <b>tube</b> or clip. [...] This technique has been highly effective as it can be carried out when plants are very small, thereby eliminating the need for large healing chambers while increasing the output. Tube grafting has been adopted as the primary method for vegetable grafting on the farm as it can be easily carried out with small healing chambers with typical success rates ranging from 85 to 90 percent 14.|$|E

Results: The success rates of <b>silicone</b> <b>tube</b> intubation were 88. 4 % and 87. 4 % in eyes with preoperative syringing results of to-tally-passed and partially-passed syringing tests, respectively, revealing {{no statistically significant differences}} (p = 0. 838, chi-square test). However, in eyes with the preoperative syringing results of partially-passed syringing tests, the success rates were 66. 7 % in patients with canalicular stenosis, 83. 3 % in patients with nasolacrimal duct stenosis, and 94. 5 % in those with diffuse stenosis (p = 0. 018, chi-square test). Conclusions: No significant differences were found in the success rates of <b>silicone</b> <b>tube</b> intubation according to preoperative sy-ringing test results. However, when considered together with DCG findings, the lowest success rate was found in eyes with the partially-passed syringing test and simultaneously showed canalicular stenosis on DCG. The syringing test results considere...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{our study}} was to assess, {{by means of an}} {{experimental}} model, whether different geometries in retrograde bypass and stent-graft deployment may affect upstream and downstream blood pressure in hybrid treatment. METHODS: An in vitro model of the arterial circulation has been prepared, which consists of a peristaltic pump, silicon tubes with geometrical and mechanical properties close to realistic arteries, a terminal reservoir kept at constant pressure, and a sequence of pressure transducers. The system allows us to study the pressure wave propagation in physiological conditions and simulate the patient's conditions as a result of debranching in 2 different configurations. RESULTS: In configuration 1, the mean pressure value (Kpa) was 4. 72 in <b>silicone</b> <b>tube</b> before stent graft and debranching, 4. 59 in visceral and renal bypass, and 4. 38 in <b>silicone</b> <b>tube</b> after stent graft and debranching. In configuration 2, the mean pressure value (Kpa) was 5. 22 in <b>silicone</b> <b>tube</b> before stent graft and debranching, 4. 48 in visceral and renal bypass, and 4. 99 in <b>silicone</b> <b>tube</b> after stent graft and debranching. CONCLUSION: The experimental data suggest that the debranching geometry and the material of the grafts and stent grafts change significantly the physiological arterial pressure possibly leading to an augmented pressure upstream of the stent grafts, owing to retrograde pressure waves toward the heart, and a decreased pressure downstream visceral and renal arteries...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the feasibility of a slow-release inoculation approach as a bioaugmentation strategy for the degradation of lindane (γ-hexachlorocyclohexane [γ-HCH]). Slow-release inoculation of Sphingomonas sp. γ 1 - 7 was established in both liquid and soil slurry microcosms using open-ended <b>silicone</b> <b>tubes</b> in which the bacteria are encapsulated in a protective nutrient-rich matrix. The capacity of the encapsulated cells to degrade lindane under aerobic conditions was evaluated in comparison with inoculation of free-living cells. Encapsulation of cells in tubes caused the removal of lindane by adsorption to the <b>silicone</b> <b>tubes</b> but also ensured prolonged biodegradation activity. Lindane degradation persisted 2. 2 and 1. 4 times longer for liquid and soil slurry microcosms, respectively, than that for inoculation with free cells. While inoculation of free-living cells led to a loss in lindane-degrading activity in limited time intervals, encapsulation in tubes allowed for a more stable actively degrading community. The loss in degrading activity {{was linked to the}} loss of the linA gene, encoding γ-HCH dehydrochlorinase (LinA), which is involved in the initial steps of the lindane degradation pathway. This work shows that a slow-release inoculation approach using a catabolic strain encapsulated in open-ended tubes is a promising bioaugmentation tool for contaminated sites, as it can enhance pollutant removal and can prolong the degrading activity in comparison with traditional inoculation strategies...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTTo {{evaluate}} {{the importance of}} collagen and hydroxyapatite in the regeneration of fractures experimentally induced in the fibulas of rats. Method: 15 rats were used. These were subjected to surgery to remove a fragment from the fibula. This site then received a graft consisting of a <b>silicone</b> <b>tubes</b> filled with hydroxyapatite and collagen. Results: Little bone neoformation occurred inside the tubes filled with the biomaterials. There was more neoformation in the tubes with collagen. Conclusion: The biomaterials used demonstrated biocompatibility and osteoconductive capacity that was capable of stimulating osteogenesis, even in bones with secondary mechanical and morphological functions such as the fibula of rats...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Application of {{combining}} herbal medicine and biomedical material science to nerve regeneration {{is a new}} approach. In this study, we describe a novel use of purified genipin, which can be extracted from Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, fixing the gelatin to be an extracellular matrix for peripheral nerve regeneration. A 10 -mm gap of rat sciatic nerve was created between the proximal and distal nerve stumps, which were sutured into <b>silicone</b> rubber <b>tubes</b> filled with either the genipin-fixed gelatin or collagen gel. <b>Silicone</b> rubber <b>tubes</b> filled with saline were used as controls. Six weeks after implantation, regeneration across the nerve gaps occurred in 80 and 90 % of the animals fro...|$|R
