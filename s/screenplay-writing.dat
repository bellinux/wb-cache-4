5000|$|Sify wrote [...] "The {{story is}} as old as the hills, and {{it is hard to believe}} that it is based on a real life {{experience}} of Vijay?s friend during his struggling dates. There is no logic and reason in Vijay?s story, as it is screeching, sentimental, soap style, over the top melodrama suited more for the Tamil stage of the 50?s". Behindwoods wrote [...] "Gnabagangal has the kind of story that poses the risk of sounding way over-the-top melodramatic or just plain clichéd, if the treatment lacked sensibility." [...] Rediff wrote [...] "The screenplay is one huge yawn-fest potted with inadvertent comical situations, mostly provided by Pa Vijay himself. The man, together with director Jeevan, needs a couple of hundred acting and <b>screenplay-writing</b> classes. Meantime, maybe Pa Vijay should stick to lyrics." ...|$|E

While working {{at what he}} called [...] "real jobs" [...] (computer support, construction), Killen {{found it hard to}} give up <b>screenplay-writing.</b> In a last-ditch effort, he returned to L.A., dressed up as a courier and dropped copies of a script at every agency he could find. Six months later, one of those agents called. [...] "That script probably wasn't deserving of getting produced," [...] he told the trade publication Variety in a 2011 [...] "10 TV Scribes to Watch" [...] feature, [...] "but it got me a teeny, tiny toe in the door." [...] Killen told the Austin American-Statesman in 2010 that [...] "I quit, but I never really quit. I took a lot of horrible, crazy jobs, but I always ended up writing about them or writing things that came out of them." [...] Killen is married to an ER doctor; the couple have three children.|$|E
