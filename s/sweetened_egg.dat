50|$|After World War II, in {{the absence}} of butter, the surface of the cake was often coated with Kogel mogel (<b>sweetened</b> <b>egg</b> yolk paste), and other types of {{decoration}} may involve dots made from (more) buttercream or cocktail cherries.|$|E
5000|$|In Bolivia, Chocolates Condor is the {{traditional}} manufacturer of [...] "Beso de Negro" [...] (Negro Kiss). The confection {{is similar to the}} German Schokoküsse in its use of a <b>sweetened</b> <b>egg</b> white foam filling rather than a marshmallow-based filling. There have been attempts to introduce variations in flavor, but the [...] "classic" [...] version remains the most popular.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} types of meringue: the <b>sweetened,</b> beaten <b>egg</b> whites that form the [...] "islands" [...] of Floating Island (also known in French as île flottante); the partly cooked {{toppings}} of lemon meringue pie and other meringue-topped desserts; and the classic dry featherweight meringue. Different preparation techniques produce these results.|$|R

50|$|The main {{ingredient}} of this dish is steamed and mashed plantain, {{which is a}} staple in Kerala, India. The relatively dry puree becomes the dough, which is rolled and flattened into patties. These patties are stuffed with <b>sweetened</b> beaten <b>egg,</b> scrapped flesh of coconut, nuts, raisins and cardamom, a spice which is rolled {{into the shape of}} a spindle with oiled palm. The stuffed dough is then deep fried in coconut oil, and is either consumed as a snack or topped with sago-based white sauce {{so that it can be}} served as a dessert.|$|R
50|$|Chatti pathiri is a layered pastry {{made in the}} North Malabar and Malabar region, of Kerala, India. It is made in both {{sweet and}} savoury {{variation}}s. The dish {{is similar to the}} Italian lasagna, but instead of pasta, pastry sheets / pancakes made with flour, egg, oil and water are used. The filling depends on the variation desired. The sweet ones are made with <b>sweetened</b> beaten <b>eggs,</b> nuts and raisins, seasoned with cardamom. The savoury ones are made with traditional meat filling used in making samosas or savoury puffs. The flour is kneaded into soft dough and rolled into thin pancakes. These pancakes are soaked in milk to soften them and arranged in layers. The fillings are added between these layers. Once layered, it goes in for baking at 180 degrees for approximately 20 minutes.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{was intended to}} study the development of color during heat treatment in a model real system consisted of sucrose, <b>sweetened</b> condensed milk, <b>egg</b> and margarine. Research applied was factorialcompletely randomized design with steaming time consist of 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours and temperatures consist of 100 oC, and 110 oC as treatment with 3 replication. The changes of color was investigated by using Munsell color system consist of value/lightness, hue angle, and chroma. Browning index was measured by using the absorbance of ethanol extracts at 420 nm in 40. 0 mm silica. Amino acid content was observed by using HPLC. Research showed that there were negative correlation between steaming time and temperature with lightness, hue angle, chroma, and amino acid. While for TCD, and browning index indicated positive correlation...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{examine the}} {{validity}} of a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (SFFQ) to identify dietary patterns in an adult Mexican population. Materials and methods. A 140 -item SFFQ and two 24 -hour dietary recalls (24 DRs) were administered. Foods were categorized into 29 food groups used to derive dietary patterns via factor analy­sis. Pearson and intraclass correlations coefficients between dietary pattern scores identified from the SFFQ and 24 DRs were assessed. Results. Pattern 1 was high in snacks, fast food, soft drinks, processed meats and refined grains; pattern 2 was high in fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and dairy products; and pattern 3 was high in legumes, <b>eggs,</b> <b>sweetened</b> foods and sugars. Pearson correlation oefficients between the SFFQ and the 24 DRs for these patterns were 0. 66 (P< 0. 001), 0. 41 (P< 0. 001) and 0. 29 (P= 0. 193) respectively. Conclusions. Our data indicate reasonable validity of the SFFQ, using fac­tor analysis, to derive major dietary patterns in comparison with two 24 DR...|$|R
