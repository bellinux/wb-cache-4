5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. In the opening shot of the episode, the bus that the children travel in to the field trip had to vibrate up and down {{to give the impression}} that it did not have bumpers and that it was falling apart. <b>Scott</b> <b>said</b> it was difficult to animate the scene because of the vibrating and the backgrounds panning. Milhouse's tutor in the episode is based on the American actor Tony Randall.|$|E
5|$|As of August 1, 2012, Fox was {{pursuing}} a sequel with Scott, Rapace, and Fassbender involved, and {{was talking to}} new writers in case Lindelof did not return. The film would be scheduled for a release no earlier than 2014. In December 2012, Lindelof {{had decided not to}} work on a sequel, citing other commitments. In June 2013, Jack Paglen was in negotiations to write the sequel. In October 2013, Scott confirmed that the script was complete, but in March 2014, Michael Green was hired to rewrite Paglen's script. In August 2015, it was announced that production for the film would begin in January 2016 with Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace reprising their roles, and Scott directing. While at the Toronto International Film Festival to promote his film The Martian, Scott stated that production on the film will begin in February 2016. In September 2015, <b>Scott</b> <b>said</b> that the title of the sequel will be Alien: Paradise Lost, an allusion to John Milton's epic poem which may also suggest a deeper connection with the Alien franchise. In an interview with Empire, <b>Scott</b> <b>said</b> that the title change did not affect the film's story and the film will have a connection to the character of Ellen Ripley.|$|E

After presenting preliminary testimony, Commonwealth's Attorney Charles Bibb asked for additional time to assemble more witnesses. Beauchamp assented to the request. A second delay pushed the hearings back to mid-December.|$|E

5|$|With 174yards, Da'Rel Scott set the Maryland {{record for}} rushing {{yards in a}} bowl game, despite playing just {{one and a half}} {{quarters}} due to his curfew suspension. The previous record was 165yards, set by Lu Gambino in Maryland's first bowl game, the 1948 Gator Bowl. Scott also broke the 1,000 yards-per-season barrier, making him one of just seven players in school history to do so. <b>Scott</b> <b>said</b> earlier in the year that reaching the 1,000-yard benchmark was a personal goal he set for the 2008 season. Between Scott and Davin Meggett, Maryland also came the closest it ever has to having both a 1,000- and 500-yard rusher in the same season. Meggett fell just 43yards shy of the 500-yard mark.|$|E

25|$|According to Deckard, {{a normal}} replicant {{can usually be}} {{discovered}} using the Voight-Kampff test, after being given 20–30 questions. Rachael answers over 100 questions before Deckard determines she is a replicant. The theatrical cut's voice-over ending said that as an experimental replicant, Rachael didn't have the four-year life but the Director's Cut did not address this. <b>Scott</b> <b>said</b> that {{he had wanted to}} cast a young actress in the role to emphasise Rachael's naivety and unworldliness.|$|E

25|$|PETA is {{critical}} of television personalities they call self-professed wildlife warriors, arguing that while a conservationist message is getting across, some of the actions are harmful to animals, such as invading animals' homes, netting them, subjecting them to stressful environments, and wrestling with them—often involving young animals the group says should be with their mothers. In 2006 when Steve Irwin died, PETA's vice-president Dan Mathews said Irwin had {{made a career out}} of antagonizing frightened wild animals. Australian Member of Parliament Bruce <b>Scott</b> <b>said</b> PETA should apologize to Irwin's family and the rest of Australia.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{attended}} Marywood Seminary, a local Catholic girls' school. She {{transferred to}} Scranton's Central High School, where she performed in several plays.

She then worked at the Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia. That autumn, she attended Marywood College, but quit after six months. Mary Matzo wanted her daughter to become a journalist, but when <b>Scott</b> <b>said</b> she would become either a stage actress or a nun, her mother relented.|$|E
25|$|Crystal Seitz, {{president}} of the Greater Reading Convention & Visitors Bureau, said a typical convention center with {{a steady stream of}} shows generates about $150 million for a local economy, including money spent for lodging and meals. Jon C. Scott, {{president of}} the Berks Economic Partnership, said he has met several times with Audubon officials and is excited about the prospects for the center. “It opens up the type of exhibits that would never have been available before,” <b>Scott</b> <b>said.</b> “It leads to other intriguing possibilities.” Some of the shows scheduled for the facility included: Philadelphia Gift Show which includes Birdwatch America-Philadelphia, Great Train Expo, Bead Fest Philadelphia, Greater Philadelphia Pet Expo, Great American Guitar Show, Sports Card & Memorabilia Show, Home & Garden Show, and The Greater Reading Sport, Travel & Outdoors Show.|$|E

25|$|During 2006, {{the press}} {{reported}} on an industrial relations dispute at Newington in which then Headmaster David Scott planned to force staff to re-apply for {{their jobs in}} a restructure that would also reduce their holidays. <b>Scott</b> <b>said</b> that 'The action was taken after {{a comprehensive review of}} the school and {{had nothing to do with}} the federal government's Work Choices reforms' The Sydney Morning Herald reported that David Scott believed that the union was being mischievous 'at best', or using an 'outright and deliberate lie' in suggesting the restructure was linked to workplace legislation. Following a meeting between the Independent Education Union and Newington College, Scott agreed to not declare senior staff positions vacant and the school continued to negotiate collective arrangements covering salary and working conditions for staff.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{addition}} of Colorado and Utah in 2011, only the Ivy League had maintained its membership for a longer time than the Pac-10 among Division I conferences. Commissioner Larry <b>Scott</b> <b>said</b> on February 9, 2010, that the window for expansion was open {{for the next year}} as the conference began negotiations for a new television deal. Speaking on a conference call to introduce former Big 12 commissioner Kevin Weiberg as his new deputy, Scott talked about possibly adding new teams to the conference and launching a new television network. Scott, {{the former head of the}} Women's Tennis Association, took over the conference in July 2009. In his first eight months on the job, he saw growing interest from the membership over the possibility of adding teams for the first time since Arizona and Arizona State joined the conference in 1978.|$|E
500|$|Later in 2008 Farrell was {{brother-in-law}} to Edward Norton's {{character in}} Pride and Glory, a police drama directed by American Gavin O'Connor. Roger Ebert disliked {{the film and}} A.

500|$|On March 17, 2012, <b>Scott</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} film leaves many {{questions}} unanswered and that these could be answered in a sequel. He said, [...] "If we're lucky, there'll be a second part. It does leave you with some nice open questions." [...] Asked whether a sequel would be a direct prequel to Alien, Lindelof said: [...] "If we're fortunate enough to do a sequel... it will tangentialize even further away from the original Alien." [...] In June 2012, Lindelof said that while plot elements were deliberately left unresolved {{so that they could}} be answered in a sequel, he and Scott had thoroughly discussed what should be resolved so that Prometheus could stand alone, as a sequel was not guaranteed. <b>Scott</b> <b>said</b> that a sequel would follow Shaw to her next destination, [...] "because if it is paradise, paradise cannot be what you think it is. Paradise has a connotation of being extremely sinister and ominous." [...] Lindelof cast doubt on his participation, and said, [...] "if [...] wants me to be involved in something, that would be hard to say no to. At the same time, I do feel like [...] might benefit from a fresh voice or a fresh take or a fresh thought." [...] <b>Scott</b> <b>said</b> that an additional film would be required {{to bridge the gap between}} the Prometheus sequel and Alien. Scott later stated it would take an additional two sequels to bridge the gap to Alien.|$|E
500|$|Exterior {{shots of}} the alien world were shot in Iceland, where filming {{occurred}} for two weeks. It commenced on July 11, 2011, {{at the base of}} Hekla, an active volcano in southern Iceland. Speaking about working at the volcano, <b>Scott</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "If one is afraid of nature in this profession then {{it would be best to}} find a different job". Filming also took place at Dettifoss, one of the most powerful waterfalls in Europe. The Iceland shoot involved 160 Icelandic crew members and over 200 imported crew. <b>Scott</b> <b>said</b> that the filming in Iceland comprised approximately fifteen minutes of footage for the film, and that the area represented the beginning of time. Morocco had been chosen as a location for these scenes, but the 2010 Arab Spring protests forced the change of venue. Alternatives including the Mojave Desert had been considered, but Scott explained that Iceland was ultimately chosen because [...] "here it is so rough and 'Jurassic-like' and that proved decisive".|$|E
500|$|In July 2011, <b>Scott</b> <b>said</b> {{that he was}} filming Prometheus {{with both}} adult-oriented R and more {{accessible}} PG-13 film ratings in mind, allowing the more adult content to be cut if necessary without harming the overall presentation. <b>Scott</b> <b>said</b> he had a responsibility to 20th Century Fox {{to be able to}} present a PG-13 cut of the film if the studio demanded, allowing it to be viewed by a wider potential audience. When asked about the rating, <b>Scott</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "the question is, do you go for the PG-13, or do you go for what it should be, which is R? Financially it makes quite a difference... essentially it's kinda R... it's not just about blood, it's about ideas that are very stressful." [...] Scott also said that, regardless of rating, he would present the most aggressive cut of the film he could, while Rothman said that Scott would not be forced to compromise the film's quality to avoid an R-rating. On May 7, 2012, Fox confirmed that the film had received an R-rating and would be released without any cuts being made. According to Scott, the scene of Shaw surgically removing her alien offspring was the significant cause of the restrictive rating, and it was suggested that removing the scene entirely would {{be the only way to}} gain a lower one. A fight scene between Shaw and the Engineer was shortened because Scott decided that Shaw directly wounding the Engineer diminished his role. Scott concluded work on the film in March 2012.|$|E

500|$|... "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" [...] is a comical Halloween episode {{which was}} filmed in Auckland, New Zealand. [...] After {{shooting}} for two days, director T.J. Scott went to producer Robert Tapert and asked permission {{to alter the}} episode's artistic style to stylised rock video horror. [...] <b>Scott</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I got the crew together and said, 'Okay guys, here we go. This {{is going to be}} a lot more vampy and fun,' and cranked up the ghetto blaster with rock music and away we went." [...] Because of the subject, Scott was able to increase the episode's level of sexual content. [...] <b>Scott</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "we did two takes that were on the edge of tasteful vampire sexuality, and we did a third take where Lucy really let loose. Of course, we all died laughing and said, 'Okay, that one is never going to make it to the screen'; we definitely pushed it too far!" [...] Ultimately, Scott felt that [...] "if you pull it too far out of context and try to take it seriously, it's a bit too rock video at times." ...|$|E
500|$|The Globe and Mail critic Jay <b>Scott</b> <b>said</b> Moonraker {{was second}} only to Goldfinger. [...] "In {{the first few minutes}} – before the credits – it offers more thrills than most escapist movies provide in two hours." [...] During the title sequence, [...] "the {{excitement}} has gone {{all the way up to}} giddy and never comes down." [...] Scott admired the film's theme song and cited with approval the film's location work. He also singled out Ken Adam's sets, dubbing them [...] "high-tech Piranesi." ...|$|E
500|$|While Martian {{gravity is}} less than 40% of Earth's, {{director}} Scott chose not to depict the gravitational difference, finding the effort less worthwhile to put on screen than zero gravity. <b>Scott</b> <b>said</b> the heavy spacesuits would weigh the main character enough {{to make up for}} not showing the partial gravity. The climate of Mars is also cold enough that it would make Watney's initial plan to disable the rover's heater immediately impractical. The average temperature is it is cold enough on Mars for carbon dioxide snow to fall at the poles in winter.|$|E
