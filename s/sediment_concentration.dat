25|$|There is {{a diverse}} range and {{combination}} of methodologies employed {{to understand the}} hydrological dynamics in salt marshes {{and their ability to}} trap and accrete sediment. Sediment traps are often used to measure rates of marsh surface accretion when short term deployments (e.g. less than one month) are required. These circular traps consist of pre-weighed filters that are anchored to the marsh surface, then dried in a laboratory and re-weighed to determine the total deposited sediment. For longer term studies (e.g. more than one year) researchers may prefer to measure sediment accretion with marker horizon plots. Marker horizons consist of a mineral such as feldspar that is buried at a known depth within wetland substrates to record the increase in overlying substrate over long time periods. In order to gauge the amount of sediment suspended in the water column, manual or automated samples of tidal water can be poured through pre-weighed filters in a laboratory then dried to determine the amount of sediment per volume of water. Another method for estimating suspended sediment concentrations is by measuring the turbidity of the water using optical backscatter probes, which can be calibrated against water samples containing a known suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>concentration</b> to establish a regression relationship between the two. Marsh surface elevations may be measured with a stadia rod and transit, electronic theodolite, Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System, laser level or electronic distance meter (total station). Hydrological dynamics include water depth, measured automatically with a pressure transducer, or with a marked wooden stake, and water velocity, often using electromagnetic current meters.|$|E

DanielsThis {{dissertation}} increases {{our understanding}} of the drivers that shape and maintain grassland streams and their watersheds by examining the influence of grazing management practices on suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations,</b> bare ground production, and changes to channel geomorphology. Chapter 2 demonstrates that cattle grazing produces significantly higher baseflow suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations</b> relative to bison grazing. Suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations</b> within bison-grazed streams are similar to ungrazed streams, indicating that the substitution of cattle for bison has resulted in degradation of baseflow water quality in grassland streams. Burning frequency, discharge, and seasonality are also significant drivers of suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations,</b> but are generally less influential than grazing treatments. Chapter 3 indicates that high density cattle grazing treatments produce more bare ground within the riparian zones of grassland stream networks, particularly underneath tree canopy cover. The increased bare ground coverage within riparian areas is correlated with increased suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations</b> during baseflow conditions, while watershed-scale bare ground production is correlated with increased suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations</b> during storm flow events. Chapter 4 demonstrates channel geometry and sedimentology are significantly influenced by grazing treatments. This dissertation is the first study to comparatively evaluate the relative influence between cattle and bison grazing on stream geomorphology within any environment. Insight gained from this project can be used by public and private land use managers to improve the environmental integrity of native grassland ecosystems...|$|R

50|$|When the {{concentration}} of suspended sediment {{at the mouth of}} a river is so large that the density of river water is greater than the density of sea water a particular kind of turbidity current can form called a hyperpycnal plume. The average concentration of suspended sediment for most river water that enters the ocean is much lower than the <b>sediment</b> <b>concentration</b> needed for entry as a hyperpycnal plume. Although some rivers can often have continuously high sediment load that can create a continuous hyperpycnal plume, such as the Haile River (China), which has an average suspended concentration of 40.5 kg/m³. The <b>sediment</b> <b>concentration</b> needed to produce a hyperpycnal plume in marine water is 35 to 45 kg/m³, depending on the water properties within the coastal zone. Most rivers produce hyperpycnal flows only during exceptional events, such as storms, floods, glacier outbursts, dam breaks, and lahar flows. In fresh water environments, such as lakes, the suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>concentration</b> needed to produce a hyperpycnal plume is quite low (1 kg/m³).|$|E

The reflectance percentage can be correlated to attenuation, Secchi disk depth or total suspended solids although the exact relationship will vary regionally and depends on the optical properties of the water. For example, in Florida Bay, 10% reflectance corresponds to a <b>sediment</b> <b>concentration</b> of 30 milligram/litre and a Secchi depth of 0.5 metre. These relationships are approximately linear so that 5% reflectance would correspond to a <b>sediment</b> <b>concentration</b> of approximately 15 milligram/litre and a Secchi depth of 1 metre. In the Mississippi River plume regions these same reflectance values would represent sediment concentrations that are about ten times or more higher.|$|E

Accumulation of Cu in leaf tissue followed a linear relationship at lower <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations,</b> with an exclusion or saturation mechanism at higher <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Lead showed little mobility to leaf tissue. Zn showed restricted accumulation in leaf tissue, which correlated with <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Decreases in <b>sediment</b> pH were found to increase Zn accumulation to root tissue.

40|$|Sediment {{stirring}} {{and sediment}} transport at a shoal {{in the western}} Dutch Wadden Sea was studied, to gain more insight {{on the behavior of}} shoals, especially on the channel-shoal sediment exchange. The research was divided into three parts: the erosion of sediment on the shoal, sediment fluxes on the shoal and the exchange of sediment with the adjacent channel. To determine the most important mechanisms behind erosion, current- and wave-induced bed shear stresses were calculated. Current-induced bed shear stress was calculated from flow velocities that were measured at several locations on the shoal and for wave-induced bed shear stress the near bed orbital velocity from a SWAN model was used. These bed shear stresses were then compared to suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations,</b> to study their relation. No relation was found, however, between bed shear stress and suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations,</b> but in other studies, this relation was also not found, and still erosion was observed. The shoal studied in this research has also shown to erode on the long-term. This will mainly be due to waves, but can also be attributed to currents. Most erosion will occur, when wind is from the east, because then waves will be largest and sediment supply from the channel will be smallest. Sediment fluxes on the shoal were obtained by multiplying measured suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations</b> with measured flow velocities. Both long-term and instantaneous fluxes were determined. The mechanisms behind residual flow and the distribution of suspended sediment over the tide was studied, because these appeared to cause the transport of suspended sediment. Residual flow on the shoal is relatively large and is strongly influence by the wind. The instantaneous suspended sediment fluxes are modified by the larger <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations</b> during flood, which is due to either the flood dominance of the tide on the shoal, or the suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the channel being higher during flood. For the exchange of sediment with the adjacent channel, a transect along the only open edge of the shoal was sailed over one tidal cycle. Along this transect suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations</b> and flow velocities were measured, from which sediment fluxes and the net deposition on the shoal could be determined. The shoal imported sediment over that one tidal cycle, due to the amplification of the flood period by westerly winds and the increased suspended matter concentrations due to increased erosion of the ebb tidal delta and the North Holland coast. The suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations</b> on the shoal have shown to relate to the suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the channel very well...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAccurately {{measuring}} sediment flux {{in large}} rivers remains a challenge {{due to the}} spatial and temporal cross-sectional variability of suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations</b> in conjunction with sampling procedures that fail to accurately quantify these differences. This study presents a field campaign methodology {{that can be used}} to improve the measurement of suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the Amazon River or similarly large rivers. The turbidity signal and Rouse model are together used in this study to define the spatial distribution of suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations</b> in a river cross-section, taking into account the different size fractions of the sediment. With this methodology, suspended sediment fluxes corresponding to each sediment class are defined with less uncertainty than with manual samples. This paper presents an application of this methodology during a field campaign at different gauging stations along a 3, 000 -km stretch of the Solimões/Amazon River during low water and flood periods. Vertical concentration profiles and Rouse model applications for distinctive sediment sizes are explored to determine concentration gradients throughout a cross-section of the river. The results show that coupling both turbidity technology and the Rouse model may improve our understanding of the spatial distribution of different sediments fractions sizes in the Solimões/Amazon River. These data are very useful in defining a pertinent monitoring strategy for suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the challenging context of large rivers...|$|R

50|$|The ECOTOX, ERED (sediment) and Toxicity Residue Databases {{are used}} by many {{regulatory}} agencies such as state environmental quality agencies and the EPA to determine regulatory environmental toxicant concentration levels. Under the Clean Water Act the EPA has used the ECOTOX database among other information to set wastewater toxicant concentration standards for industry as well as water quality standards for all contaminants in surface waters. Under the CWA, individual states must regulate water quality criteria at or below the concentrations set forth by the EPA. Sediment toxicant concentrations, however, are generally not regulated in the same way. The determination of sediment quality criteria and sediment toxicity testing is highly complex and is often regulated by states or some state run environmental agency. Sediment toxicity evaluations of contaminated sediments are very site specific and toxicant effect levels are often much more variable than those of surface waters.

Over the course of 10 years, US$2 million was spent to construct 34 sediment detention dams, 110 reservoirs, and 21 spreader dikes in order to manage the sediment issue. The purpose of the sediment control system was {{to reduce the amount of}} suspended sediment in the Bighorn River. The high <b>sediment</b> <b>concentration</b> in the Bighorn River was largely attributed to the drainage from the Fifteenmile Creek erosion. The control system was intended to reduce the sediment amount by 25%. However, 20 years after installation the control system was analyzed and uncovered that the detention dams had been improperly maintained, resulting in sediment detention failure. In addition to poor maintenance, the functional lives of the detention dams were shortened because of the location and climate. As a result, people who live downstream of the Bighorn River have to cope with the effects of the sediment. The high amounts of sediment released from the failed detention dams and control system have increased the cost to filter municipal water due to suspended sediment in the Bighorn River. The high sediment deposits have also damaged fisheries and reduced the amount of water that can be stored in a downstream reservoir.|$|E
