2500|$|Rimmer first {{appeared}} in Red Dwarfs first episode [...] "The End" [...] (1988), where he is characterised as second technician on board the mining ship Red Dwarf, ranking above Dave Lister (Craig Charles), the lowest ranked crew member on board the ship with whom he shares quarters, and below {{all four of the}} <b>service</b> <b>robots.</b> As a technician, Rimmer does maintenance work on chicken soup vending machines that not even the robots are assigned to. Rimmer is shown having difficulty revising for his [...] "engineer's exam" [...] which he hopes to pass and become an officer after having failed before prior to the episode, and reveals that he wasn't academy educated unlike others who had become officers. After Lister is awakened from stasis, where he was put as punishment for bringing an unquarantined cat on board, the ship's computer Holly (Norman Lovett) tells Lister that the ship's crew died in a radiation leak from a drive plate Rimmer had improperly repaired and Lister was kept in stasis until the radiation levels returned to normal three million years later. Rimmer is depicted as having been brought back to life as a hologram, having the same drives, feelings and emotions as the living Rimmer, but being unable to touch anything. The only other survivor on board Red Dwarf is a creature called [...] "Cat" [...] (Danny John-Jules), a descendant of Lister's pregnant cat who was safely sealed in the hold along with her unborn kittens during the radioactive crisis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Design and {{implementation}} of an autonomous <b>service</b> <b>robot</b> system based on ubiquitous sensor networks(USN) is proposed. Autonomous acquisition of the position information of a <b>service</b> <b>robot</b> is obtained through the integration of a given global map, USN motes and distance sensors without using cameras. Navigation of the <b>service</b> <b>robot</b> in a building {{is based on the}} given building map and the acquired position information. The functions that are relevant to robot movement such as path control, obstacle detection and avoidance are managed by a server notebook PC on the robot platform. According to a given building map, a proper set of locations for USN motes are determined. When a <b>service</b> <b>robot</b> passes by a mote, a set of an LED and a photo-transistor on the <b>service</b> <b>robot</b> and motes detects each other. When a mote detects a specified signal, then it reports to its server immediately. When a <b>service</b> <b>robot</b> detects a mote and then it receives a report from a mote in a short interval of time such as 100 msec, then a server makes decision that the <b>service</b> <b>robot</b> is in front of a mote which reported just before. Since the locations of motes are known, the location of a <b>service</b> <b>robot</b> is determined by the detection sensors and USN motes. Between the USN motes, position data of a <b>service</b> <b>robot</b> is obtained by the distance sensors and encoders that are mounted on the robot platform. Autonomous errand services from any location to given places by user’s commands in a large building are possible through experiments by a Pioneer 2 and ZigbeX system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The <b>service</b> <b>robot</b> domain {{has gained}} {{increasing}} attention for its significant impact on human society. By its nature, the <b>service</b> <b>robot</b> domain is component-based and distributed and comprising components are usually developed by third parties as black-box. In general, very limited information is available even in execution logs. This {{makes it difficult for}} the system integrator to understand and verify the functional behaviors of the system. The existing work on deriving functional behaviors focuses on sequential systems and assumes certain level of information available, which is not suitable for the <b>service</b> <b>robot</b> domain. In this work, we present an interaction-based approach for systematically identifying functional behaviors of a <b>service</b> <b>robot</b> system. This approach allows not only identifying functional behaviors, but also their dependencies as invariants which are useful for verifying system behaviors. We demonstrate the approach using a cognitive game robot and the results show the potential of the approach.

40|$|AbstractThe {{recruitment}} of new workforce {{for the field}} of care taking is difficult in highly industrialized countries and the gap between demand and availability of care takers will further increase with the expected increase in aged populations in the future. In particular, <b>service</b> <b>robot</b> systems are able to enhance the capabilities of assisted environments significantly as they add critical capabilities and thus allow environments to actively support care givers and care takers with the full bandwidth of necessary processes, tasks and <b>services.</b> <b>Service</b> <b>robot</b> systems add to assisted environments besides the aspect of hard physical assistance capabilities with flexibility, increased intelligence and situational awareness and provide new ways of intuitive man-machine-interaction. However, the integration of <b>service</b> <b>robot</b> systems into real world assisted environments has been difficult due to the usually separate development of environment and stand-alone robot systems. In this paper, the authors present a conceptual approach for a robotic care environment in which care environment (including room layouts, furniture and distributed sensors), <b>service</b> <b>robot</b> systems and care processes are fully synchronized and co-adapted...|$|R
