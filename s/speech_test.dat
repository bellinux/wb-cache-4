40|$|Purpose: Sometimes, children’s {{speech is}} judged as typical on picture-naming tests {{and not on}} other <b>speech</b> <b>tests,</b> even other picture-naming tests. This study {{attempts}} to explain this observation by examining the impact of increasing the numbers of polysyllabic words in a picture-naming test on the outcomes of percentages of consonants and vowels correct and phonological processes. Method: The participants were 283 randomly sampled, typically-developing children, aged 3 – 7 -years. These Australian English speakers named pictures, yielding ∼ 166 selected words, varied for syllable number, stress and shape, which repeatedly sampled all consonants and vowels of Australian English. Result: Most mismatches occurred in di- and polysyllabic words, with few in monosyllabic words: the usual words in picture-naming <b>speech</b> <b>tests.</b> Significant age effects existed for percentages of consonants and vowels correct and for 12 of the 16 phonological processes investigated. Many age effects were present at 7 years; later than often reported. Conclusion: These findings imply that additional di- and polysyllabic words add value to routine <b>speech</b> <b>testing.</b> Further, children, especially school children, who “pass” <b>speech</b> <b>tests</b> dominated by monosyllabic words may benefit from further examination of their productions of di- and polysyllabic words before finalizing clinical judgements about their speech status.

[...] Although Went For It had suggested that the Bar could have banned only solicitations to seriously injured citizens, the Court noted that the commercial <b>speech</b> <b>test</b> did not mandate that a state use the least restrictive means to implement its objective. Furthermore, the blackout period was brief, and there remained other ways for injured Floridians to learn about available legal services during that time. Lawyers may still advertise on television, on billboards, and in the yellow pages during the blackout period. [...] "These ample alternative channels for receipt of information about the availability of legal representation during the 30-day period following accidents may explain why, despite the ample evidence, testimony, and commentary submitted by those favoring (as well as opposing) unrestricted direct-mail solicitation, respondents have not pointed to - and we have not independently found - a single example of an individual case in which immediate solicitation helped to avoid, or failure to solicit within 30 days brought about," [...] a lack of access to legal services on the part of lesser educated or less sophisticated citizens. For all these reasons, the Court ruled that the First Amendment allowed Florida to impose this blackout period on direct-mail solicitation of accident victims by lawyers.|$|E
40|$|Adaptive {{procedures}} {{are a common}} method of investigating sensory abilities in research settings; however, their use in clinical settings is more limited. Little {{research has been done}} investigating the implementation of adaptive procedures into Audiological <b>speech</b> <b>tests,</b> and to date, no studies have compared and evaluated adaptive <b>speech</b> <b>tests</b> with current clinical speech audiometry. This study investigated the advantages of using both closed-set and openset adaptive <b>speech</b> <b>tests</b> in the clinical Audiology setting, with respect to administration time, accuracy, efficiency and reliability. Preliminary testing of the two major adaptive procedures (staircase and maximum-likelihood procedures) was conducted using a selection of different parameters chosen {{on the basis of the}} results of previous research (Kaernbach, 1991; García- Pérez, 1998) to determine the optimal procedures and parameters for use in clinical <b>speech</b> <b>tests.</b> Focus was given to the staircase procedures, with comparisons made between tests using variations in step size – constant step sizes and larger step sizes at the beginning – and different termination criteria. It was found that both adaptive closed-set staircase tests (with both step size variations) performed similarly, whereas the adaptive open-set staircase test with larger step sizes at the beginning showed advantages over the equivalent constant step size test in terms of administration time, accuracy and efficiency. The maximum-likelihood QUEST procedure showed advantages over the staircase procedures in terms of administration time; however, the reliability of both this <b>test</b> and conventional <b>speech</b> audiometry was poor, indicating that these tests are not the most suitable tests for a clinical setting. Subsequent clinical testing of the optimal adaptive <b>speech</b> <b>tests</b> using participants with varying degrees of hearing loss found that administration time was similar between conventional speech audiometry and the adaptive closed-set staircase tests when the optimal termination criteria identified in the Preliminary Testing Phase were employed. The adaptive open-set staircase test with larger step sizes at the beginning showed the best accuracy of any of the tests when using the pure-tone average as a reference, while the efficiency of all the adaptive staircase tests was similar. Overall, the results highlight some of the potential advantages of adaptive <b>speech</b> <b>testing</b> in the clinical Audiology setting; however, further studies are required to determine the specific parameters that achieve the best results...|$|R

40|$|According to the Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) {{guidelines}} by the American Academy of Audiology (AAA; 2010), “specific {{treatment options}} (e. g. personal FM systems) {{may be more}} appropriately recommended for individuals who present deficits on monaural low-redundancy (MLR) (e. g. speech recognition in noise, filtered or compressed speech) and/or dichotic <b>speech</b> <b>tests.</b> ” The assumption appears to be that MLR <b>speech</b> <b>tests</b> {{may be used to}} adequately evaluate the necessity for an FM system.

40|$|Objective: One {{type of test}} {{commonly}} used to examine auditory processing disorders (APD) is the low-pass filtered <b>speech</b> <b>test</b> (LPFST), {{of which there are}} various versions. In LPFSTs, a monaural, low-redundancy speech sample is distorted by using filtering to modify its frequency content. Due to the richness of the neural pathways in the auditory system and the redundancy of acoustic information in spoken language, a normal listener is able to recognize speech even when parts of the signal are missing, whereas this ability is often impaired in listeners with APD. One limitation of the various versions of the LPFST is that they are carried out using a constant level of low-pass filtering (e. g. a fixed 1 kHz corner frequency) which makes them prone to ceiling and floor effects. The {{purpose of this study was}} to counter these effects by modifying the LPFST using a computer-based adaptive procedure, and to evaluate the performance of normal-hearing participants of varying ages on the test. Methods: In this preliminary study, 33 adults and 30 children (aged 8 to 11 years) with no known history of listening difficulties were tested. The University of Canterbury Adaptive <b>Speech</b> <b>Test</b> (UCAST) platform was used to administer a four-alternative forced-choice adaptive test that altered a low-pass filter (LPF) to track the corner frequency at which participants correctly identified a certain percentage of the word stimuli. Results: Findings on the University of Canterbury Adaptive <b>Speech</b> <b>Test</b> – Filtered Words (UCAST-FW) indicated a significant maturational effect.

40|$|Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) is an auditory-specific perceptual {{deficit in}} the {{processing}} of auditory stimuli that occurs in spite of normal peripheral hearing thresholds and normal intellectual capacity American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA, 2005). The diagnostic process of APD typically involves a test battery consisting of sub-tests designed to examine the integrity of various auditory processes of the central auditory nervous system (CANS). One category of these sub-tests is the low-pass filtered <b>speech</b> <b>test</b> (FST), whereby a speech signal is distorted by using filtering to modify its frequency content. One limitation of the various versions of the FST currently available {{is that they are}} administered using a constant level of low-pass filtering (e. g. a fixed 1 kHz corner frequency) which makes them prone to ceiling and floor effects (Farrer & Keith, 1981). As a consequence, the efficacy and accuracy of these tests is significantly compromised (Martin & Clark, 1977). The {{purpose of the present study}} was to counter these effects by utilising the University of Canterbury Adaptive Filtered <b>Speech</b> <b>Test</b> (UCAST) which uses a computer-based adaptive procedure intended to improve the efficiency and sensitivity of the test over its constant-level counterparts. A comprehensive APD test battery was carried out on 18 children aged 7 - 13 suspected of APD and on an aged-matched control group of 10 children. Fifteen of the APD suspected children were diagnosed with APD based on their performance on a traditional APD test battery, comprising the Compressed and Reverberated Words Test (CRWT), the Double Digits test (DDT), the Frequency Pattern test (FPT) and the Random Gap Detection test (RGDT). In addition, the UCAST was administered to examine whether the low-pass filter limit at which children score 62. 5 % of words correct i) differed significantly between children who either passed or failed the APD test battery; ii) correlated with their score on the traditional APD battery (TAPDB); and iii) correlated with their score on a commercially available low-pass filtered <b>speech</b> <b>test,</b> the Filtered Words Subtest of SCAN-C (Keith, 2000 b). Results demonstrated a significant difference between the UCAST low-pass filter limit at which APD and control children scored 62. 5 % words correct (two-way repeated measures ANOVA, p 0. 05).

Young healthy male volunteers (n= 8) underwent procedure imitating exactly all postural changes present in the psychosocial stress model based on public speech used in this laboratory (namely changes from sitting to standing and repeated sitting). Postural changes were associated with increases in heart rate, blood pressure, plasma concentrations of noradrenaline and aldosterone and elevation in plasma renin activity. In contrast to cardiovascular parameters, adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol and adrenaline, the main characteristics of hormonal response during mental stress, were not significantly influenced.

40|$|In various {{applications}} of forensic phonetics {{the question arises}} as to how far aural-perceptual speaker recognition performance is reliable.
