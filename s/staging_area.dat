40|$|ABSTRACT. The Greenland {{white-fronted goose}} (Anser albifrons flavirostris) migrates about 3000 km from {{wintering}} grounds in Ireland and Britain to breeding grounds in West Greenland (64 ˚ – 72 ˚N). The migration route includes long flights {{over the ocean}} and over the Greenland ice cap. To obtain optimal reproduction output, {{it is important for}} the geese to build up their condition at specific spring <b>staging</b> <b>areas</b> before they disperse to the breeding grounds. Two such <b>staging</b> <b>areas</b> had been described earlier. The purpose of this study was to find the most important spring <b>staging</b> <b>areas</b> in order to protect the geese from disturbance by mineral exploration, tourism, etc. The number of breeding birds concentrated on the spring <b>staging</b> <b>areas</b> is only about 6000 of a total population of 30 000. This population is small compared to other world goose populations. Fifty areas were selected from geodetic maps (1 : 250000) and matched with snow coverage and a vegetation index (NDVI) from NOAA satellite images (in 1985 and 1988) that covered the early spring period. A total of 35 potential spring <b>staging</b> <b>areas</b> between 63 ˚ and 70 ˚N were the...|$|R

5|$|A bitumen-surfaced second runway {{was built}} at No. 1 Airstrip by No. 6 Mobile Works Squadron RAAF, {{after which the}} {{original}} runway was only used for emergencies and taxiing. The minefield around No. 3 Airstrip was lifted and the airstrip was completed, with revetments and hardstands for 70 medium bombers. A new wharf, known as Liles' wharf after the American engineer who supervised its construction, was built in September and October 1942. This was capable of handling Liberty ships. Henceforth ships could sail direct to Milne Bay from the United States, reducing the pressure on Australian ports and saving two or three days' sailing time plus the time taken to unload and then reload the cargo on smaller ships. PT boats were based at Milne Bay from December 1942, and a transhipment and <b>staging</b> <b>area,</b> overhaul facilities for PT boats, a destroyer base and Station Hospital were also constructed. Milne Bay {{was used as a}} <b>staging</b> <b>area</b> for mounting the landing at Lae in September 1943, and the New Britain Campaign in December. The base at Milne Bay remained operational {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Finland {{was divided}} into two {{operational}} zones. Northern Finland was the <b>staging</b> <b>area</b> for Army Norway. Its goal was to execute a two-pronged pincer movement on the strategic port of Murmansk, named Operation Silver Fox. Southern Finland was still under {{the responsibility of the}} Finnish Army. The goal of the Finnish forces was, at first, to recapture Finnish Karelia at Lake Ladoga as well as the Karelian Isthmus, which included Finland's second largest city Vyborg.|$|E

40|$|Finnish Environment Institute {{organized}} two ornithological {{expeditions to}} the White Sea, between 21 st September and 10 th October 1999, and between 21 st September and 10 th October 2004. The main aim of these expeditions was {{to map the}} most important <b>staging</b> <b>areas</b> for the migrating arctic birds at the White Sea. Several internationally important <b>staging</b> <b>areas</b> were found at the White Sea. Transect line counts at sea showed that the densities of birds outside these areas were smaller. During the expeditions a lot of data collected about the migration, daily rhythm, directions and routes of the migration, intensity, timing and the age and sex of the birds. Clear differences between species were noticed in the dynamics, directions of routes and intensity. Some of the species migrate on a wide front and others follow the coastal lines. The expedition {{was carried out by}} vessel. Compared to aerial surveys, which are also used for mapping of <b>staging</b> <b>areas,</b> vessel is cheaper. Vessel surveys allow more time for observing for instance birds which are sensitive or few in numbers. On the other hand a vessel is slow and shallow areas, which are important <b>staging</b> <b>areas</b> for waterfowl, are inaccessible. Aerial surveys make it possible to cover large areas and to find the most important <b>staging</b> <b>areas</b> for arctic waterfowl...|$|R

5|$|In August 1943, Goodenough Island {{was chosen}} as the site for a number of {{hospitals}} to treat casualties incurred as Allied forces advanced through the Pacific.

A <b>staging</b> <b>area</b> for 60,000troops was also established on the island.

5|$|By {{the time}} of World War I, the easy-to-reach gold was {{exhausted}} and Fairbanks' population plunged as miners moved to promising finds at Ruby and Iditarod. Construction of the Alaska Railroad caused a surge of economic activity and allowed heavy equipment to be brought in for further exploitation of Fairbanks' gold deposits. Enormous gold dredges were built north of Fairbanks, and the city grew throughout the 1930s {{as the price of}} gold rose during the Great Depression. A further boom came during the 1940s and 1950s as the city became a <b>staging</b> <b>area</b> for construction of military depots during World War II and {{the first decade of the}} Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Construction on {{the second}} {{platform}}, an island platform connected via a pedestrian overpass, began in January 2014 with the closure of Mukilteo Lane near the station.

The $11 million project, designed by AECOM and HNTB in 2012, was originally scheduled to be completed in 2015. Delays in construction, including state approval of the new elevators, pushed back the completion date to April 2016. As part of the STart program, a percentage of construction funds went towards installing art made by Whidbey Island resident Linda Beaumont at the station.|$|E

On 22 May, Lima Company uncovered a North Vietnamese <b>staging</b> <b>area</b> near Alpha 3 and destroyed it in an action that involved elements of three other Marine battalions. Then on 26 May the battalion was moved east to Dai Do as part of Operation Napoleon-Saline, in response to PAVN pressure on the supply lines to the 3rd Marine Division headquarters at Dong Ha.

5|$|In {{order to}} be able to move troops to the front in New Guinea more rapidly, to acclimatise them during the process, and to allow more {{realistic}} training of large formations in jungle and mountainous but malaria-free terrain, Blamey decided to establish a training and <b>staging</b> <b>area</b> on the Atherton Tableland in November 1942. Eventually, accommodation was provided there for 70,000 troops. As divisions returned from tours of duty in New Guinea in 1943 and 1944, they were sent to Atherton for anti-malaria treatment. The men then went on leave, after which they returned to Atherton where training was conducted before staging and departing again.|$|E
5|$|The Americans, {{assigned}} {{to land at}} Utah and Omaha, were {{to cut off the}} Cotentin Peninsula and capture the port facilities at Cherbourg. The British at Sword and Gold, and the Canadians at Juno, were to capture Caen and form a front line from Caumont-l'Éventé to the south-east of Caen to protect the American flank, while establishing airfields near Caen. Possession of Caen and its surroundings would provide a suitable <b>staging</b> <b>area</b> for a push south to capture the town of Falaise. A secure lodgement would be established and an attempt made to hold all territory north of the Avranches-Falaise line during the first three weeks. The Allied armies would then swing left to advance towards the River Seine. Montgomery envisaged a ninety-day battle, ending when all the forces reached the Seine.|$|E

Elements of the 3rd Battalion (Airborne), 319th Artillery also followed later in the day. Upon arrival at Phước Vinh, the U.S. Army task force waited for five days, but it soon became apparent that the Viet Cong had withdrawn from the area and had no intention of holding territory.
