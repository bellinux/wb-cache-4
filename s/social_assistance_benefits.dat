50|$|Canada and the United States have {{operated}} under {{the premise that}} <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>benefits</b> should not exceed {{the amount of money}} that can be earned through labor in order to give citizens an incentive to search for and maintain employment. This has led to widespread poverty amongst disabled citizens. In the 1950s, disability pensions were established and included various forms of direct economic assistance; however, these amounts were set at exceedingly low monetary levels. Since the 1970s, both governments have viewed unemployed disabled citizens as excess labor due to continuous high rates of unemployment and have made minimal attempts to increase employment, which keeps disabled people at poverty- level incomes due to the ‘incentive’ principle. Poverty is the most debilitating circumstance handicapped people face, resulting in the inability to afford proper medical, technological and other assistance necessary to participate in society.|$|E

40|$|Convergence {{of social}} {{protection}} objectives and policies in Member States is an explicit {{objective of the}} EU. Earlier {{research has shown that}} there has indeed been a tendency of convergence of social protection levels over the last decades. However, comparative studies frequently use indicators which may not be representative as measures of the welfare state. In this article we have done several convergence tests with the most recent data, using a variety of indicators of social protection: social expenditures, both at the macro and at the programme level, replacement rates of unemployment and <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>benefits</b> and poverty indicators. Together, these indicators provide a broader picture of the evolution of social protection. Our results are less clear cut than earlier findings. We still find convergence of social expenditure in EU countries over a longer period. However, this trend seems to have stagnated in recent years. The evidence is mixed for the other indicators. Replacement rates of unemployment benefits converged to a higher level, but <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>benefits</b> did not. Poverty rates and poverty gaps have converged since the mid- 1980 s, but the levels of both indicators have developed in the opposite direction. Copyright (c) 2010 The Author(s).

The eligibility requirements and benefit levels are described in great detail. Using Labor Force Survey data, we compare the characteristics of unemployed people receiving unemployment benefits with those receiving social assistance and those not receiving any benefits and we find significant differences in their characteristics. Finally, we provide an analysis of the work disincentive effects of the unemployment and <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>benefits</b> by comparing these benefits to market wages and by analyzing the effect of being in the system on the duration of unemployment of two cohorts of unemployed in 1994 and 1995. We find that <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>benefits</b> are fairly generous for low income families with more children, individuals with these characteristics have a higher probability of receiving social assistance and they tend to stay unemployed longer than those people with relatively fewer dependants. We conclude that the social assistance scheme seems to be having some disincentive effects for at least one group in the population.

40|$|The UK {{governments in}} recent history have built a strong paternalistic {{argument}} describing paid work as an essential route to improve lone parents’ mental and physical well-being. This thesis therefore sets out to explore the question of How does the transition from <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>benefits</b> into paid work affect the overall subjective well-being of lone mothers and their quality of life? On the impacts of the transitions {{to work on the}} well-being of lone parents, some less-researched areas are found when adopting an analytical framework of the Personal Well-being Index (PWI), and they are: quality of relationships, future security, community-connectedness, safety, and leisure. This thesis adopted a qualitative method to fill the gap. In-depth interviews were conducted with some 20 lone mothers with at least one child aged six or under and who had recently returned from <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>benefits</b> to paid work. Overall, the evidence shows that lone mothers may not be ‘better off’ in work either financially, emotionally, socially or physically. What is clear however, is that they are ‘better-off’ being free from the stigma associated with claiming <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>benefits.</b> This raises two policy implications. One, the social stigma is being generated and effectively delivered by political tactics to get people off benefits, and it damages the well-being of lone mothers not only during the period of being on benefits, but also for long after their transition. Two, while low out-of-work benefits and sanction regimes are considered as the right measures to encourage claimants to accept a ‘reasonable’ job because it would ultimately benefit their own well-being, it is clear that taking ‘any work’ is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Moving to any type of work in fact carries a great risk that threatens the well-being of the lone mothers, as it can equally be stigmatising, isolating, insecure, and unsafe, and not a route to becoming independent. However, rather it provides good and legitimate reasons for: reducing quality time with children, being unavailable to family and friends, and having leisure time that is informal, irregular, and fragmented, and also for not prioritising their own physical health. ...|$|E

In order to identify the determinants of claiming <b>social</b> <b>assistance,</b> we estimate a model of take-up behaviour which considers potential endogeneity of the benefit level. The estimations reveal that the degree of needs, measured as the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>benefit</b> level a household is eligible for, and the expected duration of eligibility are the key determinants of the take-up decision, while costs of claiming seem to play a minor role.

The model estimates and accompanying counterfactual simulations highlight the importance of two factors – the decline in the unemployment rate over the period, and other changes in the socioeconomic environment including two reforms to the income maintenance system in the 1990 s. The results also reveal a substantial heterogeneity in SA annual transition rate...|$|R
