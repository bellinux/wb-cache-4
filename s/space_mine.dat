50|$|Varying {{degrees of}} {{criticism}} exist regarding international space law. Some critics accept the Outer Space Treaty, but reject the Moon Agreement. Therefore, {{it is important}} to note that even the Moon Agreement with its common heritage of mankind clause, allows <b>space</b> <b>mining,</b> extraction, private property rights and exclusive ownership rights over natural outer space resources, if removed from their natural place. The Outer Space Treaty and the Moon Agreement allow private property rights for outer space natural resources once removed from the surface, subsurface or subsoil of the moon and other celestial bodies in outer space. Thus, international space law is capable of managing newly emerging <b>space</b> <b>mining</b> activities, private <b>space</b> transportation, commercial spaceports and commercial <b>space</b> stations/habitats/settlements. <b>Space</b> <b>mining</b> involving the extraction and removal of natural resources from their natural location is without question allowable under the Outer Space Treaty and the Moon Agreement. Once removed, those natural resources can be reduced to possession, sold, traded and explored or used for scientific purposes. International space law allows <b>space</b> <b>mining,</b> specifically the extraction of natural resources. It is generally understood within the space law authorities that extracting space resources is allowable, even by private companies for profit. However, international space law prohibits property rights over territories and outer space land.|$|R
40|$|NATO’s present {{capability}} {{to deal with}} a terrorist threat to our ports is slow, dangerous, and inefficient. Ports are a challenging area within which to conduct MCM operations due to several factors: shipping movements, very shallow water, turbidity, confined <b>space,</b> <b>mine</b> burial due to muddy/silty conditions, and high clutter density. The shortfall in NATO’s ability to deal with this problem has been recognised by NATO Strategic Commanders who gave the highest priority to MCM for Force Protection and Counter-Terrorism. Recent progress in underwater robotics has been aimed at developing small, rapidly deployable Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) to achieve a large spatial sampling for both acoustic and non-acoustic measurements. The vehicles that are now commercially available, have great potential to work in conjunction with existing MCM assets and have several advantages: significantly faster search rate, reduced danger to divers, rapid deployability, and ability to carry out surveys in confined areas. The NATO Undersea Research Centre studies the performance of AUVs equipped with COTS sensors and working in conjunction with conventional assets (Mine Hunters and divers) to carry out MCM operations in ports and port approaches. To measure the effectiveness of this new technology in comparison to current practice, several experiments have been conducted in the ports of La Spezia (Italy), Strenraer (Scotland), Rotterdam (Netherlands) and Olpenitz (Germany). The paper summarizes the results and discusses the lessons learnt from the trials...|$|E

(The logic of this precaution is debatable. Having come two million light years, an invasion force could simply have gone around and approached the planet by the same path as Liberator.
