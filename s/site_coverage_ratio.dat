40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to present a model that permits to {{assessment}} the quantitative green space and its costs in the urban. This approach is founded on the modelling of the functions and the corresponding spaces into an orthogonal parcel having a planar form. The elaboration of such as tool is a response to the sustainable urban development that recommends the optimization of land use. The summation of all spaces that compose the parcel defines the surface called plot surface. The green space into the parcel is a correlation of shape and disposition of the plots, and of the number of plots in the Master Plan. The urban composition is characterized by a mathematical system composed by two equations represented respectively by the urban density and the <b>site</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio.</b> This system is indeterminate because there is one unknown: the building footprint; and one correlation: the plot surface. To solving this problem, it is demanded to use loop procedure, and finite difference method that consists to introduce a random value of urban density, then to compare the obtained density with the introduced value. At last, the study finishes by the presentation of graphs illustrating the ratio and the costs of green areas in function with the urban density, and by the showing of the software...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThemain of {{this work}} is to present a study that permits to obtain a {{quantitative}} assessment of the urban density under seismic condition on sloped land. The research of relation between the bearing capacity of soil and the urban density {{is based on the}} modeling of the physical weight of an urban composition and the limit capacity of soil. The referential urban shape is assimilated to a planar parcel situated in one big number of square plots. The vertical component of earthquake acceleration is considered as additional force to the static weight of the buildings, and the horizontal component is taken as additional force that increases the lateral force of slope. This approach permits the analysis of the global slope stability of an urbanized land. The elaboration of this study is a response to the disaster risk reduction that sustainable urban development recommends. The urban composition is characterized by a mathematical system composed by two equations represented respectively by the urban density and the <b>site</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio.</b> This system is indeterminate because there is one unknown: the building footprint; and one correlation: the plot surface. To solving this problem, it is demanded to use loop procedure, and finite difference method that consists in introducing a random value of density, and then to comparing the obtained density with the introduced value. The study beginswith the evaluation of the weight of the floors, and thenfollows with thedistribution of the weight of all buildings, that composes one orthogonal parcel, on the global surface of parcel. This repartition gives an equivalent uniform charge. Therefore, by this simplification, it is possible to resolve the problem by static method. At last, the study finishes by the presentation of graphs showing the relation between the soil bearing and the urban density...|$|E

40|$|Urban Weather Generator (UWG) is {{the urban}} design {{simulation}} tool that provides climate-specific advice for cityscape geometry {{and land use}} to assist the development of energy-efficient cities that are also thermally comfortable. The software enables urban designers to parametrically test built densities for masterplanning and urban planners to advocate zoning regulations such as building height and land use as well as policies for traffic intensity with energy and thermal implications of these interventions. UWG is the first tool publicly available that incorporates microclimatic considerations in urban design and energy simulations. The project succeeds the work of Bueno et al. (2014) to develop a useful and accessible urban design tool to model urban heat island effect (UHI) from measurements at an operational weather station based on neighborhood-scale energy balances. The sensitivity analyses for Boston, MA, USA, and Punggol, Singapore identify as key parameters the building morphologies such as <b>site</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> and fac̦ade-to-site ratio; building surface albedo and emissivity; and sensible anthropogenic heat in the urban canyon. The consistency of results for these cities reduced required user inputs to the model by 46 % without decreasing the simulation accuracy. The developed software is available as a stand-alone tool {{as well as a}} new plug-in for the Rhinoceros-based urban modeling interface (umi) to integrate the microclimate analysis in the formal design process. The graphical user interface is written in programming language C# in the Microsoft. NET platform and is available free of charge at [URL] The newly proposed workflow for energy- and thermal comfort-driven urban design and planning is demonstrated through a case study of the new 130 thousand square meter development on the MIT East Campus in Cambridge, MA, USA. An IPCC-based climate change prediction is considered along with UHI to evaluate the proposed massing models at each design phase to ensure thermally comfortable urban development along the way. by Aiko Nakano.

Electronic transport behaviours of rGO samples with coverages of 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50  % are obtained together with the properties of intrinsic graphene sheet for comparison. It is exposed that depending on the <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio,</b> rGO structures show different and peculiar electronic transport characteristics such as (i) rGO with 6.25 and 12.5  % coverages show NDR behaviour, (ii) the transmission of the GO sample with 6.25  % <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> diminishes after the NDR voltage range, (iii) the I–V characteristic of the rGO with 25  % coverage is highly linear making it to be suitable for use as interconnects and (iv) while rGO with 50  % coverage shows non-conducting behaviour near zero applied voltage as estimated by previous studies [21], it starts to be conducting beyond a threshold voltage. These different transport characteristics of rGO samples are shown to be originated from the variation of their transmission eigenstates and the localization degree of these eigenstates by the applied voltage. It is concluded that the voltage-dependent transport properties of rGO structures have diverse behaviours depending on the <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> hence their peculiar I–V characteristics can be engineered to achieve specific functions in nanoscale circuits easily since the <b>coverage</b> <b>ratios</b> of rGO structures can be precisely controlled using reduction by laser light.|$|R

DESIGN [...] Pilot study of women eligible for screening but not for personal invitation. The results of this study were compared with the results of routinely screened younger women (aged 50 - 64) from the same general practice. SETTING [...] One group general practice in south Manchester. PATIENTS [...] The 631 women aged 65 - 79 on the practice list. A total of 42 (7 %) were excluded by the general practitioner, and 22 (4 %) invitation letters were returned by the post office. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Response rates to invitation for screening assessed by three indices: crude population <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio,</b> crude invited population <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio,</b> and corrected invited population <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio.</b> RESULTS [...] 344 Patients aged 65 - 79 (61 % of those invited, excluding those who could not be traced) were screened compared with 77 % of women aged 50 - 64. The three response indices were higher for younger women than older: crude population <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> = 66. 5 %, crude invited population <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> = 69. 3 %, corrected invited population <b>coverage</b> <b>ratio</b> = 76. 8 % for women aged 50 - 64, compared with 54. 5 %, 58. 4 %, and 60. 7 % respectively for women aged 65 - 79.
