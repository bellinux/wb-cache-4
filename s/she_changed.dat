She took judo lessons once {{a week at a}} local school, but found partners reluctant to train with her, as she was often slow to release her grip. She took a job at Bratby and Hinchliffe, an engineering company in Gorton, but was dismissed for absenteeism after six months.|$|E
5|$|After {{several more}} French {{attempts}} at conciliation had failed, in September 1664 Marguerite Louise left her apartment in Palazzo Pitti, refusing to return. As a result, Cosimo moved her into Villa di Lappeggi. {{where she was}} watched by forty soldiers, and where six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had to follow her everywhere because it was feared she would abscond. The following year, <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> tack, and was reconciled with the Grand Ducal family. That particular reconciliation collapsed, however, after the birth in 1667 of Anna Maria Luisa.|$|E

30|$|Hannah: I {{feel like}} {{there were so many}} critics of her, {{especially}} early on. During the beginning of her campaign, people were saying ‘Oh, my goodness… she’s showing her shoulders! Her dress is so fitted!’ But <b>she</b> never <b>changed.</b> <b>She</b> didn’t <b>change</b> the way that she was dressed… <b>she</b> didn’t <b>change</b> her accessories… <b>she</b> didn’t <b>change</b> any of it. And, as a female, I think you have to appreciate that.|$|R
5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} {{an early version}} of it that was not released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead turned it into a pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she wanted it to be just like Shear's version, with a bit more of an acoustic sound. However, <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> her mind, saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E

5|$|Clara {{explored}} eastern religions for a {{few years}} and then eventually became a Christian Scientist, although there is some question as to her seriousness and commitment to it. She authored a book on the subject: Awake to a Perfect Day, published by Citadel Press, NYC, 1956 After originally objecting to the release of her father's Letters from the Earth in 1939, <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> her stance shortly before her death in 1962 and allowed them to be published. She also published biographies of both her father (My Father, Mark Twain in 1931) and of her first husband (My Husband: Gabrilowitsch in 1938).|$|E
5|$|Edward left Britain for Austria, {{where he}} stayed at Schloss Enzesfeld, {{the home of}} Baron Eugen and Baroness Kitty de Rothschild. Edward had to remain apart from Wallis until there was no danger of compromising the {{granting}} of a decree absolute in her divorce proceedings. Upon her divorce being made final in May 1937, <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> her name by deed poll to Wallis Warfield, resuming her maiden name. The couple were reunited at the Château de Candé, Monts, France, on 4 May 1937.|$|E
5|$|Fay {{enrolled}} at the University of Chicago as a physics major, but <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> her major to chemistry after taking a course in that subject from Julius Stieglitz.

Fay completed a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in chemistry in 1904 and 1905, respectively.

5|$|My {{interpretation}} {{is that she}} isn’t {{trying to keep the}} secret. That she doesn’t care. <b>She</b> <b>changed</b> her last name to avoid getting kidnapped, but really, if anyone figured it out and asked her, she’d just probably be like “Yeah, shut up!” or whatever. I feel like everyone at ISIS is so self-involved and so concerned with furthering their own agenda that it would never occur to them to think that anyone else has anything else going on.|$|E

During the Khmer Rouge years, five children and fourteen grandchildren disappeared; Sihanouk believed they {{were killed by the}} Khmer Rouge.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the death}} of Kirchner caused a power vacuum, as Cristina Kirchner had ruled so far as a figurehead, while Néstor Kirchner still managed the {{government}}. <b>She</b> <b>changed</b> {{the style of the}} government making it more authoritarian, and more critical of the U.S.. She broke with allies of her husband, such as the union leader Hugo Moyano, and increased the political clout of the youth wing La Cámpora instead. She also relied on her public image more than her husband had. The popularity of the Kirchners had been in a decline at the time of Néstor's death, but after being widowed, Cristina Kirchner's popularity increased greatly. As a result, she won the reelection in the 2011 general elections by a landslide.|$|E

A number of Kirchnerite officials refused to resign their offices to allow Macri to appoint his own people. Even the handover ceremony became controversial, as Kirchner refused to attend it. It was {{the first time since the}} end of military rule in 1983 that the outgoing president did not hand over power to the incoming one.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Sarah-Jane and K9 {{returning}} to Doctor Who was {{an idea of}} Russell T Davies from pitching the show in 2003. Such a use would show what would happen after a companion left the Doctor, without dwelling {{too much on the}} classic series. It was Davies' full intention for Sarah Jane to be used for this, and while Sladen originally declined a request, thinking her role would not be important, <b>she</b> <b>changed</b> her mind when she realised she would be {{the focal point of the}} adventure. After production of the episode was finished, Sladen was approached about a full spin-off series, The Sarah Jane Adventures, which was formally announced on 14 September 2006.|$|E
