He had the hunter's patience, and was capable of {{creeping}} on his knees in the mud for hours in the attempt to kill a duck. He could imitate almost all the birds and animals he knew. His whistle would call the mother grouse to him. He could stop the whooping of cranes in their <b>steady</b> <b>flight,</b> and his honking deceived the wary geese.

"I don't {{know what}} I may have said then," [...] replied Miriam, whose <b>steady</b> <b>flight</b> was not arrested by this ineffectual bolt; [...] "I {{was no doubt}} already {{wonderful}} for talking of things I know nothing about.

Of course I'm a contortionist and of course there's a hateful side, but don't you see how that very fact puts a price on every compensation, on the help of those who are ready to insist on the other side, the grand one, and especially on the sympathy of the person who's ready to insist most and to keep before us the great thing, the element that makes up for everything?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{had become}} of Ostrog?" [...] asked Graham, and even as he spoke he saw that all eyes were turned from him towards {{the crest of the}} Council House building. He looked also in this {{direction}} of universal attention. For a moment he saw nothing but the jagged corner of a wall, hard and clear against the sky. Then in the shadow he perceived the interior of a room and recognised with a start the green and white decorations of his former prison. And coming quickly across this opened room and up to the very verge of the cliff of the ruins came a little white clad figure followed by two other smaller seeming figures in black and yellow. He heard the man beside him exclaim [...] "Ostrog," [...] and turned to ask a question. But he never did, because of the startled exclamation of another of those who were with him and a lank finger suddenly pointing. He looked, and behold the aeropile that had been rising from the flying stage when last he had looked in that direction, was driving towards them. The swift <b>steady</b> <b>flight</b> was still novel enough to hold his attention.|$|E

40|$|Two {{identification}} methods, {{the equation}} error method and the output error method, {{are used to}} estimate stability and control parameter values from flight data for a low-wing, single-engine, general aviation airplane. The estimated parameters from both methods are in very good agreement primarily because of sufficient accuracy of measured data. The estimated static parameters also agree with the results from <b>steady</b> <b>flights.</b> The effect of power different input forms are demonstrated. Examination of all results available gives the best values of estimated parameters and specifies their accuracies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a new method of characterizing the external noise radiation {{of a helicopter}} suitable {{for use in the}} generation of ground noise contours for community land use planning and assessing the acoustic observability of helicopter flight plans. This work is an extension of the semi-empirical Rotorcraft Noise Model / Quasi-Static Acoustic Mapping (RNM/Q-SAM) methodology of characterizing helicopter externally radiated noise using acoustic radiation hemispheres. Current methods of interpolation of data on RNM acoustic radiation spheres are found to lead to high levels of inaccuracy when using sparse microphone arrays. A new method of interpolation based on the theory of radial basis functions is developed in this thesis and shown to lead to significantly improved accuracy. This thesis also extends the RNM/Q-SAM methodology to turning flight conditions. New test procedures are developed for <b>steady</b> turning <b>flight</b> conditions and then used in the acoustic flight testing of the Bell 206 B helicopter. The extended RNM/Q-SAM method is applied to the resulting data set in order to generate the first acoustic radiation hemispheres for a helicopter in <b>steady</b> turning <b>flight</b> across a range of flight path angles. The results indicate that the extended Quasi-Static Acoustic Mapping technique is valid for <b>steady</b> turning <b>flight</b> Blade-Vortex Interaction noise. Furthermore, <b>steady</b> turning <b>flight</b> alone is shown not to lead to large increases in externally radiated noise compared to similar straight-line flight conditions. This indicates that high BVI noise levels reported during turns in prior research were most likely caused by transient maneuvers and not turning flight alone...|$|R
60|$|A long, long {{distance}} from the town, {{in the midst of}} dreadful wilds scarcely known to man, there dwelt the Griffin whose image had been put up over the church-door. In some way or other, the old-time sculptor had seen him, and afterward, to the best of his memory, had copied his figure in stone. The Griffin had never known this, until, hundreds of years afterward, he heard from a bird, from a wild animal, or in some manner which it is not now easy to find out, that there was a likeness of him on the old church in the distant town. Now, this Griffin had no idea how he looked. He had never seen a mirror, and the streams where he lived were so turbulent and violent that a quiet piece of water, which would reflect the image of any thing looking into it, could not be found. Being, as far as could be ascertained, the very last of his race, he had never seen another griffin. Therefore it was, that, when he heard of this stone image of himself, he became very anxious to know what he looked like, and at last he determined to go to the old church, and see for himself what manner of being he was. So he started off from the dreadful wilds, and flew on and on until he came to the countries inhabited by men, where his appearance in the air created great consternation; but he alighted nowhere, keeping up a <b>steady</b> <b>flight</b> until he reached the suburbs of the town which had his image on its church. Here, late in the afternoon, he alighted in a green meadow by the side of a brook, and stretched himself on the grass to rest. His great wings were tired, for he had not made such a long flight in a century, or more.|$|E
50|$|<b>Steady</b> <b>flight,</b> unaccelerated flight, or {{equilibrium}} {{flight is}} a special case in flight dynamics where the aircraft's linear and angular velocity are constant in a body-fixed reference frame. Basic aircraft maneuvers such as level flight, climbs and descents, and coordinated turns can be modeled as <b>steady</b> <b>flight</b> maneuvers. Typical aircraft flight consists {{of a series of}} <b>steady</b> <b>flight</b> maneuvers connected by brief, accelerated transitions. Because of this, primary applications of <b>steady</b> <b>flight</b> models include aircraft design, assessment of aircraft performance, flight planning, and using <b>steady</b> <b>flight</b> states as the equilibrium conditions around which flight dynamics equations are expanded.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] {{is called}} the {{specific}} range (= range per unit weight of fuel; S.I. units: m/kg).

50|$|The most general {{maneuver}} {{described by}} the <b>steady</b> <b>flight</b> equations above is a steady climbing or descending coordinated turn. The trajectory the aircraft flies during this maneuver is a helix with zE as its axis and a circular projection on the xE-yE plane.

The analysis at a single set of flight conditions is then applied {{to a range of}} different flight conditions.|$|E

5|$|Lag {{errors are}} caused {{by the fact that}} any changes in the static or dynamic {{pressure}} outside the aircraft require a finite amount of time to make their way down the tubing and affect the gauges.
