40|$|Abstract. Based on {{a certain}} big site {{preparation}} project, the method to determine the dry density of filler for <b>soil-aggregate</b> <b>mixture</b> has been studied, and the characteristics of particle breakage after vibration is discussed. The {{results show that the}} surface vibration compaction method to determine the maximum dry density with mixture is suitable to <b>soil-aggregate</b> <b>mixture.</b> Considering the compaction factor of 0. 94, the dry density control standard deducing from the maximum dry density is close to the projected field compaction test results. The particle breakage of <b>soil-aggregate</b> <b>mixture</b> during vibration is close to 20 %, which shows that the particle breakage is significant. This study may have certain significance to similar projects...|$|E
50|$|The AASHTO Soil Classification System was {{developed}} by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, and is used as a guide for the classification of soils and <b>soil-aggregate</b> <b>mixtures</b> for highway construction purposes. The classification system was first developed by Hogentogler and Terzaghi in 1929, but has been revised several times since.|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} study the performance characteristics of low cost roadway surfaces of soil-aggregate-sodium chloride mixtures. Many roads have been successfully stabilized with sodium chloride. However, little information is available on either {{the properties of the}} road materials or the effects of sodium chloride on the materials. The performance of some of the sodium chloride stabilized roads in Franklin County, Iowa, and the performance of some near-by nonchemically treated roads has been studied. The study of sodium chloride stabilized roads was restricted to the roads in which the binder soil used in construction came from the same source. The effects of sodium chloride on some of the engineering properties of the soil and <b>soil-aggregate</b> <b>mixtures</b> used were studied in the laboratory...|$|R
