25|$|In {{defense of}} {{the theory that the}} organic {{composition}} of capital does rise in the long term (lowering the average rate of profit), Mandel claimed that there does not exist any branch of industry where wages are a growing proportion of total production costs, as a <b>secular</b> <b>trend.</b> The real trend is the other way: toward semi-automation and full automation which lowers total labor costs in the total capital outlay. Critics of that idea point to low-wage countries like China, where the long run trend is for average real wages to rise. For example, the Chinese Communist Party aims to double Chinese workers' wages by 2020.|$|E
25|$|However, around 1670 a {{combination}} of politico-military upheavals (wars with France and England) and adverse economic developments (a break in the upward <b>secular</b> <b>trend</b> of price levels) brought the Dutch economic boom to an abrupt end. This caused a retrenchment of the Dutch economy in the period up to 1713, in which the industrial sector was partly dismantled and growth in trade leveled off. The economy struck out in new directions, including whaling, colonial plantations in Suriname, and new types of trade with Asia. However, these riskier ventures often failed to bring commensurate gains. The VOC embarked on a period of profitless growth. The financial strength proved more durable, enabling the Netherlands {{to play the role}} of a major power in the European conflicts around the turn of the 18th century by hiring mercenary armies and subsidizing its allies.|$|E
25|$|This {{favorable}} economic constellation came to {{a rather}} abrupt end around 1670 {{as a consequence of}} two mutually reinforcing economic trends. The first was the rather abrupt closure of major European markets, especially France, for political reasons, as indicated in the previous section. This {{put an end to the}} heretofore secular increase in trade volumes for the Dutch economy. The effect of this stall probably would not have been as serious, but at approximately the same time the <b>secular</b> <b>trend</b> of the price level had reversed from inflation to deflation. The whole of the 16th century, and the first half of the 17th century, had seen a rising price level. This now suddenly {{came to a}}n end, to be replaced by deflationary tendencies that would last into the 1740s. Because of the tendency of nominal wages to be sticky downward, the already high level of real wages in the maritime provinces continued to rise, even though the business cycle went downward. This of course reinforced the trade depression in the short run, but in the longer run it caused a structural realignment of the Dutch economy.|$|E

40|$|A {{critical}} {{question in the}} global warming debate concerns {{the causes of the}} observed trends of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) atmospheric circulation over recent decades. <b>Secular</b> <b>trends</b> have been identified in the frequency of occurrence of circulation regimes, namely the positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the hemispheric wave- 3 pattern which is associated with blocking. Previous studies into the causes of these <b>secular</b> <b>trends</b> have either been purely model based, have not included observational forcing data or have mixed external forcing with indices of internal climate variability impeding a systematic and unbiased attribution of the causes of the <b>secular</b> <b>trends.</b> Most model studies also focused mainly on the austral summer season. However, the changes to the storm tracks have occurred in all seasons and particularly in the austral winter and early spring when midlatitude blocking is most active and stratospheric ozone should not play a role. Here we systematically attribute the <b>secular</b> <b>trends</b> over the recent decades using a non-stationary clustering method applied to both reanalysis and observational forcing data from all seasons. While most previous studies emphasized the importance of stratospheric ozone depletion in causing austral summer SH circulation trends, we show observational evidence that anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations have been the major driver of these <b>secular</b> <b>trends</b> in the SAM and blocking when all seasons are considered. Our results suggest that the recovery of the ozone hole might delay the signal of global warming less strongly than previously thought and that effects from all seasons are likely crucial in understanding the causes of the <b>secular</b> <b>trends...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} provide {{accurate}} methods for stature estimations, ancestry differences and secular changes in stature and limb proportions need to be noted. Stature and limb proportion changes in human population groups are influenced by various genetic and environmental factors. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate ancestry differences and secular changes in stature and limb proportions of South African population groups and to assess how these variables differ between individuals from southern and northern hemispheres. The sample comprised of osteometric and anthropometric data from modern black and white South Africans (17 and 68 years), North American and white European (Dutch and Swiss) populations. The sample was divided into birth cohorts of 5 years or 10 years to observe <b>secular</b> <b>trends.</b> Ancestry differences and <b>secular</b> <b>trends</b> in stature and limb proportions between South African population groups were compared. Also, differences and <b>secular</b> <b>trends</b> in stature and limb proportions were compared between white North American and European groups to determine whether differences exist between the southern and northern hemisphere groups. Additionally, the differences in stature between black and white South African and North American groups were compared. It was found that white South Africans were significantly taller than their black South African counterparts. Significant positive <b>secular</b> <b>trends</b> in stature were observed in black South African males while non-significant increases were observed in white South African males and white and black South African females. The <b>secular</b> <b>trends</b> in European samples are significantly greater than those observed in white South African males. Black South African groups had greater limb and distal limb lengths than white South African groups. Proximal limb ratios increased while the distal limb ratios decreased which suggests that regression formulae to estimate stature need to be regularly updated. The upper limb ratio and arm ratios were significantly higher in white South African groups compared to white North American groups. Secular changes are constantly taking place due to a combination of various factors such as climate, nutrition. Overall, secular changes in limb proportions indicate a trend where South African groups are becoming more similar to each other. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016.
