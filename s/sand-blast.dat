2500|$|Also called {{joint and}} crack repair, this method's {{purpose is to}} {{minimize}} infiltration of surface water and incompressible material into the joint system. Joint sealants are also used to reduce dowel bar corrosion in Concrete Pavement Restoration (CPR) [...] techniques. Successful resealing consists of old sealant removal, shaping and cleaning the reservoir, installing the backer rod and installing the sealant. Sawing, manual removal, plowing and cutting are methods used to remove the old sealant. Saws are used to shape the reservoir. When cleaning the reservoir, no dust, dirt or traces of old sealant should remain. Thus, it is recommended to water wash, <b>sand-blast</b> and then air blow to remove any sand, dirt or dust. The backer rod installation requires a double-wheeled, steel roller to insert the rod to the desired depth. After inserting the backer rod, the sealant is placed into the joint. There are various materials to choose for this method including hot pour bituminous liquid, silicone and preformed compression seals.|$|E

In addition, the admixture of HF ãHNO 3 and CH 3 COOH was used to etch the metal-intermingled layers on the surface of the waster silicon chips so that high purity silicon chips were reclaimed. We can identify that the two methods of <b>sand-blasting</b> and acid etching would be available in reclaiming high purity silicon materials from waste electronic grade silicon chips. <b>Sand-blasting</b> is suitable to reclaim silicon chips with large size, and acid-etching is suitable to reclaim silicon chips with small size or silicon grains.

40|$|Wind turbine {{performance}} can be significantly reduced when the surface {{integrity of the}} turbine blades is compromised. Many frontier high-energy regions that are sought for wind farm development including Nordic, warm-humid, and desert-like environments often provide conditions detrimental {{to the surface of}} the turbine blade. In Nordic climates ice can form on the blades and the turbine structure itself through a variety of mechanisms. Initial ice adhesion may slightly modify the original aerodynamic profile of the blade; continued ice accretion can drastically affect the structural loading of the entire rotor leading to potentially dangerous situations. In warmer climates, a humid wind is desirable for its increased density; however, it can come at a price when the region supports large populations of insects. Insect collisions with the blades can foul blade surfaces leading to a marked increase in skin drag, reducing power production by as much as 50 %. Finally, in more arid regions where there is no threat from ice or insects, high winds can carry soil particles eroded from the ground (abrasive particles). Particulate-laden winds effectively <b>sand-blast</b> the blade surfaces, and disrupt the original skin profile of the blade, again reducing its aerodynamic efficiency. While these problems are challenging, some mitigative measures presently exist and are discussed in the paper. Though, many of the current solutions to ice or insect fouling actually siphon power from the turbine itself to operate, or require that the turbine be stopped, in either case, profitability is diminished. Our survey of this topic in the course of our research suggests that a desirable solution may be a single surface engineered coating that reduces the incidence of ice adhesion, insect fouling, and protects the blade surface from erosive deterioration. Research directions that may lead to such a development are discussed herein. Wind energy Surface engineering Turbine icing Insect fouling Blade surface erosion Materials science...|$|E

As such, it has become an important design consideration in many situations. The materials investigated in the present studies are stainless steels, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, alumina ceramics, with and without silicate glassy phase, and zirconia. These are some of the potential materials for use in the high temperature erosive-corrosive environments;The erosion or erosion-corrosion experiments were performed in a high temperature <b>sand-blast</b> type of test rig. The variables studied included the temperature, material composition, heat treatment condition, impingement velocity and angle, erodent concentration, etc. The morphological features of the eroded or eroded-corroded surfaces, substrate deformation, and oxide characteristics were studied by optical and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis. The scratch test, single ball impact, and indentation tests were used to understand the behavior of oxide film in particle impacts;Based on these investigations, the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the mechanical or combined mechanical and chemical actions in erosion was developed. The analysis focused on the interactions among factors such as the temperature-dependent properties of materials, microstructure including the role of multiple phases in ceramics, high temperature erosion characteristics, cracking fracture of ceramics, oxidation rate, and the composition, structure, and properties of oxide scales. The enhanced corrosion rate from erosion damage, the effect of corrosion on material mass loss, and enhanced erosion rate at high temperatures were interpreted in terms of the above factors;This dissertation is composed of five major parts which present various aspects of high temperature erosion and erosion-corrosion based on the investigations on the three kinds of materials for high temperature applications;PARTS I and II are the investigations of high temperature erosion-corrosion behavior of ferritic, austenitic, martensitic and precipitation hardening stainless steels.

40|$|Ventifacts are phenoclasts {{fashioned}} by corrasion (abrasion by wind-carried particules). They are climate-sensitive sedimentary features testifying {{long periods}} without any vegetation in non-marine environments. Therefore, {{they can be}} used, with more confidence than aeolian dunes, to characterize desert conditions, under hot or cold palaeoclimate. However, long experience in studying Permian,Triassic and Quaternary ventifacts from various countries in Europe and Africa, shows that many clasts presented in the literature as ventifacts, are not, and conversely, that typical ventifacts often go unnoticed. That is why {{we set out to}} review critically the diagnostic properties used to distinguish them. Because, in the current nature, most of ventifacts are found in desert pavements (regs), thin gravel beds on outcrops are frequently supposed correspond to such deflation lags, and thus to be the best place to found ventifacts. The reality is often disappointing because such beds may be formed in more dynamic environments: on fluvial bars or on sea shore. Undisturbed paleoregs are very rare, and ventifacts are usually found scattered, at varied reworked states. As ventifacts are typical of hyper-arid climates, the sedimentary units were they formed are devoid of palaeosols. Nevertheless, in some cases, climate change could lead to incor-poration of ventifacts in soil profiles of semi-arid type. Surface features are not useful to recognize ventifacts, except a polarity resulting from the contrast between a smooth upper face and an irregular basal face. Ventifacts are often reputed to exhibit a polished aspect. On modern specimens, this is due to a varnish (coating) of variable chemical composition; on ancient ventifacts (and even other pebbles) enbedded in a clayey matrix, a true mechanical polish can occur, probably related to differential compaction. Mesoscale features, usually neglected, are very significant. While in water, gravels wear out almost exclusively by mutual friction, in air, sandblasting is able to reach the most depressed zones of their surface. Therefore, even if the outline of a ventifact shows reentrants, it is uniformly smooth, and whether pre-existent cavities appear, their wall is also smoothed. Shallow scour pits, initiated by removal of soft grains, formed on the same way; they may mutually interfere to produce a polygonal pattern. On the other hand, especially on ventifact edges, may appear large percussion scars, produced by the largest clasts rolled by <b>sand-blast.</b> At macroscale, general shape hardly allows distinguishing a ventifact from any other clast, especially if it is a first-cycle sedimentary element. What is characteristic is the occurrence of specific ridges limiting facets; some are sinuous, fading towards the base, others tend to follow the general outline. The number of ridges depends partly on the initial shape of the clast, but the classic dreikanter is the least typical shape, since it may have another origin...|$|E
