5|$|The sea {{appears in}} human culture in {{contradictory}} ways, as both powerful but <b>serene</b> <b>and</b> as beautiful but dangerous. It has {{its place in}} mythology and religion, literature, art, poetry, film, theater, and music. The Ancients personified it, believing it {{to be under the}} control of a being who needed to be appeased. It has been populated by fantastic creatures: the Leviathan of the Bible, Scylla in Greek mythology, Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the kraken of late Norse mythology. The sea is especially common in Christian imagery, where several of Jesus's disciples were said to have been fishermen on the Sea of Galilee.|$|E

25|$|From 3 February, the Allies were shelled by Japanese {{artillery}} and air attacks on Singapore intensified {{over the next}} five days. The {{artillery and}} air bombardment strengthened, severely disrupting communications between Allied units and their commanders and affecting preparations for the defence of the island. From aerial reconnaissance, scouts, infiltrators and high ground across the straits, such as at Istana Bukit <b>Serene</b> <b>and</b> the Sultan of Johor's palace, the Japanese commander—General Tomoyuki Yamashita—and his staff gained excellent knowledge of the Allied positions. Yamashita and his officers stationed themselves at Istana Bukit <b>Serene</b> <b>and</b> the Johor state secretariat building—the Sultan Ibrahim Building—to plan for the invasion of Singapore. Although advised by his top military personnel that Istana Bukit Serene was an easy target, Yamashita was confident that the British Army would not attack the palace because it belonged to the Sultan of Johor. Yamashita's prediction was correct; despite being observed by Australian artillery, permission to engage the palace was denied by their commanding general, Bennett.|$|E

25|$|Chandogya Upanishad, {{in chapter}} 1.2, {{describes}} {{the battle between}} Devas and Asuras on various sensory powers. This battle {{between good and evil}} fails to produce a victor and simply manifests itself in the perceived universe, as good or evil sights witnessed by beings, as good or evil words shared between people, as good or evil smells of nature, as good or evil feelings experienced, as good or evil thoughts within each person. Finally, the Deva-Asura battle targets the soul, where Asuras fail and Devas succeed, because soul-force is <b>serene</b> <b>and</b> inherently good, asserts Chandogya Upanishad.|$|E

25|$|Set in two spaces, one {{of which}} {{represents}} the personal life of Marilyn Monroe (1926-1962) and the other which depicts moments of American political and civic life, the story interweaves the myth and decline of the movie star up to her mysterious death, with accounts of significant past events: the Korean war, the McCarthy era investigations, the prosecution of Wilhelm Reich, and the lectures of Timothy Leary {{on the use of}} psychedelic drugs. Marilyn is seen as an involuntary victim of the mass culture of her time, a figure only superficially <b>serene</b> <b>and</b> optimistic, a heroine in spite of herself, whose contradictory personality is represented in twelve scenes, equally distributed in the two acts.|$|E
25|$|The Mando, a {{contemporary}} form of dance music, evolved in Salcette {{in the first}} half of the nineteenth century out of wedding music, specifically the Ovi. The songs in this style are <b>serene</b> <b>and</b> sedate, generally a monologue in the Bramhin Konkani dialects of the South Goan villages of Loutolim, Raia, Curtorim, and Benaulim. They are traditionally sung during the Shim (bridal departure) ceremony. Early composers of the Mando were Ligorio de Costa of Courtarim (1851–1919) and Carlos Trindade Dias. Deknni is a semi-classical dance form. One woman starts the dance and is later accompanied by other dancers. The Mussoll (pestle dance), believed to be first performed by the Kshatriyas of Chandor, commemorates the victory of King Harihara II (son of King Bukka I of the Vijaynagar Empire) over the Chola Empire at Chandrapur fortification in the fourteenth century. Other dances are the Portuguese Corridinho and Marcha. Dulpod is dance music with a quick rhythm and themes from everyday Goan life. Fell is a music genre performed by men and women during the Goa Carnival. Other dances performed at the Goan Carnival are Fulwali, Nistekaram, Vauradi, and Kunbi. The Ghumot is a musical instrument played, especially during weddings, and is used while performing a Mando. The instrument has the form of an earthen pot that is open at both sides. One end is covered with the skin of some wild animal, and the other is left open.|$|E

500|$|Complaining {{that the}} {{structure}} has a more fortress-like exterior than its predecessor, Kamin viewed the architectural attempt as a fumbled work. [...] However, he considered the interior to be <b>serene</b> <b>and</b> contemplative {{in a manner that}} complements the contemporary art and compact and organized {{in a manner that is}} an improvement on the more traditional mazelike museums. [...] Comparing the building to the Sullivan Center and the Art Institute of Chicago Building, Kamin describes the museum as an homage to two of Chicago's architectural influences: Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Louis Sullivan. [...] Other critics also note the presence of Mies van der Rohe's spirit in the architecture.|$|E

500|$|Discussing Captain Dumitriu's suicide attempt, John Simon writes: [...] "It is {{visually}} stunning {{and emotionally}} shattering, {{but it may}} be a bit too theatrical. Still, with such writing, directing, and acting—most prominently from Kristin Scott-Thomas and Claudiu Bleonţ as the Dumitrius, but also from the rest—what is a small faux pas? This film resonates in the memory, insistently and inspiredly." [...] Simon also discusses the cinematography, arguing that Călin Ghibu's use of lighting manages to convey the [...] "almost unearthly beauty at sunset", which helps viewers understand why Scott Thompson's character uses Mount Fuji as her preferred metaphor for the place. Of this aspect, James notes: [...] "Like its heroine, the film's <b>serene</b> <b>and</b> beautiful appearance masks a powerful conscience." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's [...] "junction point" [...] {{concept was}} created by Louden. There are {{approximately}} 40 variations in the game TV show, triggered by [...] "quantum ripples", which unlock deleted scenes and give players additional insight on the story, and junction points. The player plays {{part of the game}} as Paul <b>Serene</b> <b>and</b> makes decisions as him at these points. Inspired by Die Hard, the writers hoped that this approach would allow them to create a complex villain with depth. According to Louden, the story characters are not [...] "black and white", and depending on the player's perspective, players will feel sympathy for the villain and feel torn when making the choices. Junction points were a tool used by Remedy to add replayability to the game, unlocking alternate content and changing the state of the world, and the gameplay segments remain identical regardless of players' choices.|$|E
