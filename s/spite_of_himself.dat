He has mentioned that he used his opportunities at school well by taking part in karate, horseback riding and swimming and noted that such early exposure to activities gave him confidence as a youngster. Vikram lurked in {{the fringes of the}} school's theatre club for a long period and often took part in backstage work before being handed the lead role in a school adaptation of Molière's The Doctor in <b>Spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>Himself</b> after the original lead had contracted chicken pox. Despite expressing his interest to join films after school, his father forced him to go through education with Vikram subsequently graduating in English literature from Loyola College, Chennai and working halfway through an MBA programme. Through the prolific dramatics club, Vikram appeared in stage productions including college adaptations of The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial and Peter Shaffer's Black Comedy, receiving best actor awards for his performances. After winning a Best Actor Award at a function held at IIT Madras, Vikram was hit by a truck during a while on his motorbike on the way home and suffered a serious leg injury. He remained hospital-ridden for three years during college and subsequently went through twenty three surgeries to prevent his leg from being amputated. Vikram then returned to finish the final year of his degree after his accident and secured permission to finish his dissertation at home, as he was only able to walk on crutches for a short period.|$|E

The critic David Benedictus wrote of Richardson's performance, [...] "...he is choleric and gouty certainly, the script demands that he shall be, but his most engaging quality, his love for his son in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself,</b> shines through every line." [...] In 1967 he again played Shylock; this was the last time he acted in a Shakespeare play on stage. His performance won critical praise, {{but the rest of the}} cast were less well received.|$|E

500|$|The premiere, {{originally}} planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th {{because of the}} illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as [...] "a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes..." [...] The audience's appreciation was not reflected {{in the majority of}} the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that [...] "this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself,</b> or at least pretending to be". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a [...] "claque" [...] of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.|$|E
500|$|Ron {{particularly}} despises {{talking to}} members of the public, which is why he deliberately designed his office to be uninviting to visitors, in part by mounting a double-barreled, sawed-off shotgun on a swivel atop his desk aimed at the guest chair, so it will be pointed at anyone who wants to speak to him, a claymore mine (front-pointed toward enemy), and a Czech hedgehog. Despite his lack of interest in the job, Ron occasionally demonstrates he is a good manager who recognizes the abilities of his co-workers. He claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him, and that his best friend was a co-worker he knew for three years without ever learning his name. However, Ron cares more about his colleagues than he lets on and often helps them in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself.</b> Despite sharing a nearly opposite view on the role of government, Ron gets along well with Knope, and the two share a strong mutual respect. Although Leslie had considered a job offer in the neighboring town of Eagleton, she stays based on advice from Ron that, no matter how many job offers she gets, Pawnee will always be her hometown. Ron also developed a grudging, avuncular affection for April's husband, Andy Dwyer, and decided to give him the [...] "Ron Swanson Scholarship" [...] ($940) so Andy can attend one college course: Women's Studies, after Andy and April couldn't afford to pay it. In the voiceover while Ron drops Andy off for his first day of class, he recalls his own first day of college when his father dropped him off at the steel mill. His father thought he shouldn't bother with college, but Ron hitched a ride to the school and went anyway.|$|E
500|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{rebellion}} have {{been the source of}} much discussion and theories among modern scholars. Moving away from the personal relationship between al-Hajjaj and Ibn al-Ash'ath, Alfred von Kremer suggested that the rebellion was linked with the efforts of the non-Arab converts to Islam (the mawālī) to secure equal rights with the Arab Muslims. Julius Wellhausen rejected this view as the main source of the revolt, seeing it instead as a reaction of the Iraqis in general and the ashrāf in particular against the Syrian regime of the Umayyads as represented by the overbearing (and notably low-born) al-Hajjaj. Other scholars have seen in it a manifestation of the tribal factionalism between the northern Arab and southern Arab ("Yamani") tribal groups prevalent at the time. Thus a poem by a certain A'sha Hamdan in celebration of the rebellion shows not only a religious but also a tribal motivation of the rebel troops: al-Hajjaj is denounced as an apostate and a [...] "friend of the devil", while Ibn al-Ash'ath is portrayed as the champion of the Yamani Qahtani and Hamdani tribes against the northern Arab Ma'addis and Thaqafis. On the other hand, as G. R. Hawting points out, this is insufficient evidence to ascribe purely tribal motivations to the revolt: if Ibn al-Ash'ath's movement was indeed led largely by Yamanis, this simply reflects {{the fact that they were}} the dominant element in Kufa, and while al-Hajjaj himself was a northerner, his main commander was a southerner. Wellhausen's analysis, furthermore, ignored the evident religious dimension of the revolt, especially the participation of the fanatical zealots known as qurrāʾ ("Quran readers"). While the [...] "religious polemic used by both sides [...] is stereotyped, unspecific and to be found in other contexts", according to C. G. Hawting, there do appear to have been specific religious grievances, notably the accusation that the Umayyads were neglecting the ritual prayer. It seems [...] that the revolt began as a simple mutiny against an overbearing governor who made impossible demands of the troops, but, at least by the time the army reached Fars, a religious element had emerged, represented by the qurrāʾ. Given the close [...] "interaction of religion and politics in early Muslim society", as G. R. Hawting points out, the religious element quickly became dominant, as seen by the difference between the oath of allegiance (bayʿa) sworn at the beginning of the revolt and that exchanged between the army and Ibn al-Ash'ath at Istakhr in Fars. While in the first Ibn al-Ash'ath declared as his intention to [...] "depose al-Hajjaj, the enemy of God", in the latter, he exhorted his men to [...] " [...] the Book of God and the Sunna of His Prophet, to depose the imāms of error, to fight against those who regard [...] as licit". Although Ibn al-Ash'ath remained as the head of the uprising, Veccia Vaglieri writes that after this point [...] "one has the impression that [...] the control of the revolt slipped from his hands", or that, as Wellhausen comments, [...] "he was urged on in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself,</b> and even if he would, could not have banished the spirits which he had called up. It was as if an avalanche came rushing down sweeping every thing before it".|$|E

40|$|Special {{relativity}} calculates, {{by means}} of the Lorentz gamma factor, the proper time of all inertial systems from the observer proper time, which is taken as a time standard. So, any temporal inference relies in first instance on the observer own time. The question is thus: what fixes the observer proper time? This will be the crucial point debated here. This implies analyzing at the very first why the observer can be taken as a motionless reference in <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> being <b>himself</b> inertial. Is this just an approximation, and if so, up to what extent can it be applied? The framework of special relativity is compared to an amended form in which the fact <b>of</b> taking <b>himself</b> as a reference does not allow the observer to overlook its own kinetics. So, the issue stands on which of two formulations of the Lorentz gamma factor is the most accurate one: its standard expression or an amended one which takes into account the fact that the observer is himself inertial, while the former disregards it. When the observer speed is ignored, the two formulations become identical. Hence, the standard relativistic expression of gamma can be seen as an approximation applicable when the observer motion is null or low, such as it is the instance on Earth.

During an {{interview}} for a study on self-directed learning, the duck carver revealed that he considered himself a non-reader and not a good learner.

Reflecting on his learning experience, he realized that he had, in fact, learned well and consequently viewed himself more as a learner than before. Through interaction with people, print resources, and his own experience in raising ducks, significant learning resulted. Given the motivation, he had been able to devise strategies to find out what he needed to know. In taking the initiative and responsibility to achieve his goals, the duck carver demonstrated how he could direct his own learning. What is key for learners is to know how to learn and to take personal initiative in directing one’s learning...|$|R
