40|$|Recently {{there has}} been an {{emergence}} of large, indefinite length data (video) streams as used in many computer vision problems. There is now a requirement to transmit these streams between remote locations where post-processing may occur and the re-sults of this may be released to further remote locations for additional post-processing. Using two main networking theories, Chord and the Publish/Subscribe paradigm, ChoPS (Chord based Publish/Subscribe) was conceived. ChoPS uses a distributed hash table, notably Chord, which is demonstrated to have an average of O(log 2 (n)) time in order to disseminate data to n hosts over a unicast network such as the Internet. ChoPS also implements the Publish/Subscribe paradigm, which is inherent in the anony-mous video stream <b>subscription</b> <b>application.</b> Along with results demonstrating the efficiency of Chord when used for such data distribution, a full system layout and specification is provided for an implementation of ChoPS...|$|E

The proposed application is built upon a multiple compatible mobile phone menu-based <b>subscription</b> management <b>application</b> that is also customizable. Since SMS has the potential to fill significant connectivity and service gaps, this application can provide support for them to become more ubiquitous. Event-based approach towards context-aware personalized notification service is adopted, i. e. user will receive relevant immediate SMS to his/her mobile phone based on his/her subscription for preferred notifications. A trigger enables event management system to send out (semi-) automated personalized notification. Notification services that understand the context within which their users operate, i. e. identity, activity and time are derived based on a set of predetermined rules. This will benefit the stakeholders in terms of getting up-to-date notifications via the delivery system which implements SysMan TellMe V 8. 04 as the delivery protocol and SMS server...|$|R

We have developed the ConArch toolset to support the automated verification of architecture-level behavioral constraints. A key feature of ConArch is programmable mapping for architecture to the implementation. Here, developers implement queries to identify the points in the target program that correspond to architectural interactions. ConArch generates runtime observers that monitor the flow of execution between these points and verifies whether this flow conforms to the behavioral constraints. We illustrate how the programmable mappings can be exploited for verifying behavioral constraints of a smart grid application that is implemented with two simulation frameworks...|$|R

40|$|Current {{digital media}} {{distribution}} platforms continue their march towards streaming service-based infrastructures, delivering content to users {{when and where}} they want it: laptops, set top boxes, home entertainment systems, and the new ubiquity: mobile devices. This model was first demonstrated by utilizing the multicast backbone technology in the early 1990 s and took {{the better part of}} a decade to make inroads in changing the way individuals consume broadcast, mainstream, and syndicated video media. It took the advent of streaming technology, high-speed internet adoption, and a willingness from content owners to license their treasured content with upstart streaming media platform companies. Digital music distribution showed consumers, content owners, and distribution channels what can happen when one player effectively creates a new, disruptive technology platform, i. e. Apple’s iTunes Music Store. Now content owners are afraid of a single distributor dictating the methods, prices, and channels by which their content reaches consumers. Today, streaming technology is making a play against the incumbent iTunes transactional model of Buy, Download, and Own digital distribution by providing varies models to consumers: integrated advertising-based, subscription-based, and traditional cable “packages” with integrated on-demand streaming, all of which retain no permanence or ownership for the end user. Content owners are treading carefully, trying to avoid the single, dominant point of distribution that Apple achieved in music distribution. The results of this are less optimal from both a market standpoint and especially the experience for consumers. Media companies frequently change the terms of their licenses, or drastically increasing their licensing costs, causing radical fluctuations in the long-term viability of the nascent distribution platforms. Consumers interact with this environment through complicated, multiparty <b>subscriptions,</b> multiple <b>applications</b> or web interfaces, umpteen logins, various bills, and a nebulous understanding and ability to sit down and watch premium content when and where they want it.

There is a need for event stream processing technology to analyze this vast amount of sequential data to enable online operational decision making. Existing techniques such as traditional online analytical processing (OLAP) systems are not designed for real-time pattern-based operations, while state-of-the-art Complex Event Processing (CEP) systems designed for sequence detection do not support OLAP operations. We propose a novel E-Cube model which combines CEP and OLAP techniques for efficient multi-dimensional event pattern analysis at different abstraction levels. Our analysis of the interrelationships in both concept abstraction and pattern refinement among queries facilitates the composition of these queries into an integrated E-Cube hierarchy. Based on this E-Cube hierarchy, strategies of drill-down (refinement from abstract to more specific patterns) and of roll-up (generalization from specific to more abstract patterns) are developed for the efficient workload evaluation. Our proposed execution strategies reuse intermediate results along both the concept and the pattern refinement relationships between queries. Based on this foundation, we design a cost-driven adaptive optimizer called Chase, that exploits the above reuse strategies for optimal E-Cube hierarchy execution. Our experimental studies comparing alternate strategies on a real world financial data stream under different workload conditions demonstrate the superiority of the Chase method. In particular, our Chase execution in many cases performs ten fold faster than the state-of-the art strategy for real stock market query workloads.
