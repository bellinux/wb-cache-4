The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the {{evidence}} presented by the <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> bypass tube failure, determining the failure mechanism, determining the root cause of the failure and to recommend appropriate corrective actions. The power plant is a coal fired power plant with its normal operation temperature of 540 °C. This study consists of failure mode inventory collection of the <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> bypass tube failure, collection of background information about the process, component function and operating conditions. Detailed investigation carried out by visual examination, nondestructive testing (NDT), metallurgical testing which consists of microstructure examination, chemical testing and mechanical testing. Optical Microscopy (OM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) combined with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), Glow Discharge Spectrometer (GDS) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Diffraction (XRD) experiments were used throughout the investigation on the sample obtained. From the evidence with considering the contribution factors such as temperature, pressure and environment, a fault analysis was made and it can be concluded that the cause of failure to the <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> bypass is due to multi causes which consists of creep failure and hydrogen damage. The root cause of high temperature creep and hydrogen damage which occurred at the <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> bypass tube is due to material properties that are inadequate for the actual operating conditions of a <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> bypass tube which is not according to the specification. The material must be actually ASTM SA- 335 -P 22 (2. 25 Cr-lMo) with 490 MPa minimum tensile strength and 320 MPa minimum yield strength.

50|$|Over 45 {{percent of}} the fuel used by US {{manufacturers}} is burnt to make steam.

50|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>traps</b> {{work best}} when sized {{specifically}} for the application they are used on. Generally, {{it is better to}} oversize, as they will still discharge condensate when present and close or obstruct for live steam. However an oversized steam trap may wear quickly, waste energy (use steam), and if drastically oversized can cause process issues.|$|E
40|$|The <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> is {{considerably}} overlooked and unappreciated within the steam and condensate distribution system. Its {{role is to}} remove condensate and non-condensables from the primary steam loop. However, the conventional methods used today are the devices developed a century ago. An original {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the universal replacement of conventional <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> technology with control valves. The condensate flowrate is determined by using a standardized <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> performance test. During experimentation, the mass flowrate is acquired through the utilization of a weigh tank technique. Results indicated that the application of a control valve is feasible and provides remarkable advantages over the traditional approach. Improvements to enhance efficiency and effectiveness are evident through the performance attributes of the control valve, which includes auxiliary prediction and diagnostic capabilities.

50|$|The {{simplest}} form {{of steam}} trap is a disc or short solid pipe nipple {{with a small}} hole drilled through it installed at the lowest point of the equipment. Since steam condensate will collect at the lowest point and live steam is about 1200 times greater in volume than this hot liquid, condensate is effectively removed and steam is blocked. However, {{the vast majority of}} <b>steam</b> <b>traps</b> in current operation are of the mechanical or thermostatically operated design.|$|E
5000|$|Mechanical traps. They have a float {{that rises}} and falls in {{relation}} to condensate level and this usually has a mechanical linkage attached that opens and closes the valve. Mechanical traps operate in direct relationship to condensate levels present {{in the body of}} the steam trap. Mechanical <b>steam</b> <b>traps</b> have a typical service of life of 3-4 years. Inverted bucket and float traps are examples of mechanical traps. Float traps are classified into [...] "free ball float traps" [...] and [...] "lever ball float traps".|$|E

30|$|Steam {{bypassing}} from injection {{to production}} well is another factor impacts the thermal efficiency of steam injection. The producer {{is designed to}} remove condensed steam and movable bitumen through gravity drainage. If the condensation rate of fluids is in balance with the fluid movement created by gravity, then, the steam bypassing is prevented (Yuan and Nugent 2013). During bitumen production, a liquid pool is formed around the production well. This liquid pool, being denser than steam, is not easily displaced by the steam phase and prevents live steam from flowing directly into the producer. This phenomenon is known as <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> {{and the maintenance of}} this liquid pool is called <b>steam</b> <b>trap</b> control (Gates and Leskiw 2010).|$|R

40|$|Refining 155, 000 {{barrels of}} crude oil daily, a Louisiana plant markets oil {{products}} to gas stations in at least 26 states, including Washington, D. C. The plant uses 8, 538 <b>steam</b> <b>traps</b> with 1, 200 -, 600 -, 250 -, 75 -, 40 - and 15 -psi nominal pressures. Standardized with inverted bucket <b>steam</b> <b>traps,</b> the Louisiana refinery?s maintenance and energy coordinator was content with the results. The Spirax Sarco Inc (SSI) team demonstrated SSI?s Energy Service Group (ESG) capabilities and successes to the refinery manager, operations manager and production manager. From 2004 through 2006, the team presented a series of ESG seminars at the refinery site. The numerous models demonstrated quantitative savings with 3 - to 12 -mo paybacks. For a complete SSI turnkey program, for example, the SSI team presented an ROI with {{less than six months}} payback. The ESG survey found that only 3, 952 (46. 3 %) of the <b>steam</b> <b>traps</b> were operating correctly. The remaining <b>steam</b> <b>traps</b> experienced a variety of failures, including: 613 (7. 2 %) that failed open; 2, 763 (32. 4 %) were cold; 1, 012 (11. 9 %) that failed closed; 6 (0. 0 %) exhibited rapid cycling; and 192 (2. 2 %) were disconnected. The team also found performance and temperature issues with the HP sulfur reactors in the SRU units, largely due to the application of inverted bucket <b>steam</b> <b>traps.</b> Plus, as a result of excessive steam leaks, the sulfur reactors were creating a safety hazard. When these results were presented, management agreed that the sulfur reactors needed process improvement. The SSI team recommended replacing the inverted bucket <b>steam</b> <b>traps</b> with 1 - 1 / 2 -in. strainers and 1 - 1 / 2 -in. flanged float & thermostatic <b>steam</b> <b>traps.</b> They also suggested that the existing trap discharge piping should be removed and re-piped with globe-style bypass valves and gate-style isolation valves to reduce flow velocity. Once the SSI team began negotiations, it only took one survey for the Louisiana refinery to realize all the energy savings opportunities. In fact, the ESG survey uncovered more than $ 1. 3 million in steam losses through failed <b>steam</b> <b>traps</b> and another $ 1 million in steam leak opportunities and production, process, safety and environmental improvements. Impressed with the survey results, the refinery approved the estimated $ 110, 000 turnkey project, which offered a 5. 3 -month payback. Further negotiations netted the team annual steam trap surveys for the next three years, as well as an approved 2008 energy budget of $ 600, 000. Additionally, the Louisiana refinery has indicated that upon successful completion of the ESG program, SSI?s annual energy budget will increase to $ 1, 000, 000. ...|$|E

40|$|Energy will {{continue}} to be an ever increasingly important factor in {{the cost of doing business}} in the decade of the 80 ' s. In many petrochemical industries, energy is the second most costly item in producing a product. About 36 % of our nation's total energy consumption is used by industry in producing the goods which are consumed around the world. Steam is the most commonly used energy source for the petrochemical industry. Most of this steam is used for heating and evaporating the many petrochemical liquids. This steam is then condensed and is removed from the system at the same rate as it is being formed or the loss of heat transfer will result. From a cost standpoint only condensate should be allowed through the trap. But at many plants half of the <b>steam</b> <b>traps</b> are passing excess steam. This is caused by neglect of aged <b>steam</b> <b>traps</b> which have worn out and misapplication of <b>steam</b> <b>traps</b> by oversizing or using the 'wrong' type trap.
