The tumor is predominantly occurs in the ventricular system of the brain. The tumor is benign and exhibits a good response to surgical resection and radiation therapy. The typical central neurocytoma occurs in the supratentorial ventricular system in young adults. Extraventricular neurocytomas are rare in the spinal cord. In the present study, two cases of craniocer-vical neurocytomas and the clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging observations, pathological features and two‑year follow‑up results are reported. The first case presents a 26 year old male with an intramedullary mass extending from the medualla oblongata to the T 4 <b>segement</b> of the spine.

40|$|Power-gating is a {{technique}} investigated widely for reducing leakage energy in the functional units of microprocessors at the architectural level. Effective power-gating involves deactivating idle functional units for sustained periods incurring little or no performance degradation. Accurate prediction of long idle periods is essential, which, in turn, depends on the application program characteristics. In this thesis, we propose a compiler-based leakage reduction technique for embedded architectures by exploiting the well-known attributes of embedded applications, namely, small code size and intensive loops. From the control flow graph (CFG) representation of the source program, we construct a forest of loop hierarchy trees (LHTs), which capture the nesting loop properties of the program. As an LHT satisfies the partial ordering on the loop nesting, we exploit this property to identify maximal subgraphs (of functional unit idleness) in the original program. For each subgraph so found, a sleep instruction is introduced at the entry point of the corresponding code <b>segement,</b> thus optimizing the number of sleep instructions. The sleep instruction has one operand, a bit-vector comprised of ON/OFF controlbits for all functional units in the data path.

An additional objective was to detect GVH reactions that may be elicited by the three haplotypes of the Rfp-Y system. The three recombinants (ZfRl, B^, and 5 ^- 10) that have been shown serologically to possess the B-F 24 haplotype were tested against each other {{to determine if they}} were able to elicit a GVH reponse. The results indicate that these three recombinants possess the similar histocompatibility segment B-F 24. Three other recombinants (B^, B^, and B& 11) that were shown serologically to possess the B-F 21 histocompatibility region also gave compatible responses when they were tested against each other. The most recently identified recombinant, 5 ^ 12 was shown to contain the histocompatibility segment B-F 8. The five recombinant haplotypes (B^, B^, B^, and B^) resulting from a recombination involving and B^ have been determined serologically to contain the histocompatibility <b>segement</b> B-F 2. When these recombinants were tested against each other a single incompatible reaction was detected. The incompatible reaction occured when B^ containing cells were injected into embryos possessing the Z?R 2 genotype. This incompatible reaction was weak, indicating that perhaps this mild reaction was due to some differences in non- 5 histocompatibility antigens. Results of GVH splenomegaly reactions involving the Rfp-Y system demonstrated that in the scope of the testing performed, Rfp-Y does not influence GVH splenomegaly reactions. There were three weak incompatible responses after donor birds had been stimulated with foriegn Rfp-Y antigens. This mild GVH response is suggestive of possible Rfp-Y influence; however, a more plausable interpretation would be some non-B, non-F incompatibility. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E
40|$|Bone {{remodeling}} is {{very important}} for repair of microfractures and fatigue damage and prevention of excessive aging and its consequences. Bone remodeling lasts for about 6 - 9 months. During this period osteoclasts resorb damaged bone and osteoblasts synthesize new bone. The lifespan of mature osteoclasts is about 15 days and for osteoblasts 3 months. Therefore, the time required for the remodeling of a given <b>segement</b> of bone is much longer than the lifespan of its cells which perform remodeling. A supply of new osteoblasts and osteoclasts are therefore needed for succesful remodeling by the basic multicellular unit. The major event that triggers osteogenesis is the transition of mesenchymal stem cells into bone differentiating osteoblast cells. Osteoblast commitment and differentation are controlled by complex activities. Many factors are involved in the regulation of osteoblastogenesis. Bone morphogenetic proteins and the Wnt glycoproteins play crucial roles in signaling osteoblast commitment and differentiation, and are the only known factors capable of initiating osteoblastogenesis from uncommitted progenitors. They can initiate commitment of mesenchymal cells to osteoblastic lineage. The initial cell division is asymmetric, giving rise to another stem cell and a committed osteoprogenitor. After commitment to the osteoblastic lineage, a osteoprogenitor cell gives rise to the transit-amplifying compartment. At this stage osteoprogenitor cells proliferate intensively. After this stage, the cells are more differentiated and give rise to preosteoblasts which express both STRO 1, alkaline phosphatase, pyrophosphate, and type 1 collagen. Preosteoblasts are committed to the osteoblast lineage with extensive replicative capacity, but have no self-renewal capacity. Preosteoblasts form the intermediate stage of osteoblastogenesis. The mature osteoblasts express osteopontin, alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin. This stage is responsible for the laying down of bone. Mature osteoblasts have limited replicative potential. About 65 % of mature osteoblasts and a proportion of cells in the transient amplifying compartment terminate in apoptosis. Apoptosis is a critical determinant of osteoblast number in the basic multicellular unit. The terminal stage of the bone lineage is the post-mitotic osteocyte which is embedded within the advancing osteoid. A minor component of mature osteoblasts differentiate into lining cells of the bone. Lining cells line the quiscent bone with no remodeling activity. Bone morphogenetic proteins, Wnt glycoproteins, Hedgehog proteins, PPARgama ligands, and transcription factors such as Runx 2 and Osterix play important roles in these critical steps of osteoblastogenesis and bone remodelling.

In particular, a set of natural numbers A can wtt-compute a DNR function iff there is a nontrivial recursive lower bound on the Kolmogorov complexity of the initial segments of A. Furthermore, A can Turing compute a DNR function iff there is a nontrivial A-recursive lower bound on the Kolmogorov complexity of the initial <b>segements</b> of A. A is PA-complete, that is, A can compute a { 0, 1 }-valued DNR function, iff A can compute a function F such that F (n) is a string of length n and maximal C-complexity among the strings of length n. A ≥T K iff A can compute a function F such that F (n) is a string of length n and maximal H-complexity among the strings of length n. Further characterizations for these classes are given.

In the 1930 :ies Svenssons "answer" to his question is more radical in the aspect the he, and other Cristian liberals are prepared to use the state in order to foster their ideals and impede developement. However, after the Second World War Svensson gets more defensive and adopt a strategy of protecting the <b>segements</b> of society, in particular the countryside, were he believes his ideal of "naive" freedom is still alive...|$|R
40|$|Several {{classes of}} DNR {{functions}} are characterized {{in terms of}} Kolmogorov complexity. In particular, a set of natural numbers A can wtt-compute a DNR function iff there is a nontrivial recursive lower bound on the Kolmogorov complexity of the initial segments of A. Furthermore, A can Turing compute a DNR function iff there is a nontrivial A-recursive lower bound on the Kolmogorov complexity of the initial <b>segements</b> of A. A is PA-complete, that is, A can compute a { 0, 1 }-valued DNR function, iff A can compute a function F such that F(n) is a string of length n and maximal C-complexity among the strings of length n. A ≥T K iff A can compute a function F such that F(n) is a string of length n and maximal H-complexity among the strings of length n. Further characterizations for these classes are given. The existence of a DNR function in a Turing degree {{is equivalent to the}} failure of the Recursion Theorem for this degree; thus the provided results characterize those Turing degrees in terms of Kolmogorov complexity which do no longer permit the usage of the Recursion Theorem. ...|$|R
40|$|Recently, our {{laboratory}} {{demonstrated that}} Paneth cell defensins, innate antimicrobial peptides {{that contribute to}} mucosal host defense, are able to regulate {{the composition of the}} intestinal bacterial microbiome. Using complementary mouse models of defensin deficiency (MMP 7 −/−) and surplus (HD 5 +/+), we noted defensin-dependent reciprocal shifts in the dominant bacterial species of the small intestine, without changes in total bacterial numbers. In addition, mice that expressed HD 5 showed a significant loss of <b>segemented</b> filamentous bacteria (SF B), resulting in reduced numbers of Th 17 cells in the lamina propria. This data showed a novel role for PC defensins in intestinal homeostasis, by regulation of the small intestinal microbiome. The microbiome plays an essential role in mediating host physiology, metabolism and immune response. The ability of PC defensins to regulate the composition of the biome suggests a much broader importance of these innate immune effectors than previously considered. In this addendum, the role of PC defensins in the regulation of the intestinal microbiome is reviewed, and discussed in the context of recent evidence that highlights the important role of PC s and defensins in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} two main domestic pig dispersal routes in East Asia: one is from the Mekong region, through the upstream region of the Yangtze River (URYZ) to the middle and upstream regions of the Yellow River, the other is from the middle and downstream regions of the Yangtze River to the downstream region of the Yellow River, and then to northeast China. The URYZ {{was regarded as a}} passageway of the former dispersal route; however, this assumption remains to be further investigated. We therefore analyzed the hypervariable <b>segements</b> of mitochondrial DNA from 513 individual pigs mainly from Sichuan and the Tibet highlands and 1, 394 publicly available sequences from domestic pigs and wild boars across Asia. From the phylogenetic tree, most of the samples fell into a mixed group that was difficult to distinguish by breed or geography. The total network analysis showed that the URYZ pigs possessed a dominant position in haplogroup A and domestic pigs shared the same core haplotype with the local wild boars, suggesting that pigs in group A were most likely derived from the URYZ pool. In addition, a region-wise network analysis determined that URYZ contains 42 haplotypes of which 22 are unique indicating the high diversity in this region. In conclusion, our findings confirmed that pigs from th...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Yinyanghuo (Herba Epimdii) is a {{traditional}} Chinese herb containing prenylated flavonoids as its active constituents. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the significance of the intestinal hydrolysis of prenylated flavonoids by lactase phlorizin hydrolase (LPH), an enzyme at the brush border membrane of intestinal cells. Methods: A four-site perfused rat intestinal model was used. The concentration of the flavonoids of interest and their metabolites in different intestinal <b>segements</b> were analyzed by HPLC, and the apparent permeabilities were calculated. A lactase phlorizin hydrolase inhibitor (gluconolactone) was employed to investigate the mechanism of the intestinal absorption, and the metabolites of the four flavonoids were identified using LC/MS/MS. Results: Diglycosides (icariin) or triglycosides (epimedin A, epimedin B, and epimedin C) were hydrolyzed rapidly in duodenum and jejunum producing one or two metabolites, while a monoglycoside (baohuoside I) was absorbed directly. When co-perfused with glucono-lactone, both the hydrolysis of diglycosides and triglycosides were significantly inhibited, with inhibition rates for icariin (62 %, 50 %, 40 %, 46 %), epimedin A, (55 %, 26 %, 21 %, 14 %); epimedin B (42 %, 40 %, 74 %, 22 %), and epimedin C (42 %, 40 %, 52 %, 35 %) in duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon, respectively. Also the metabolites of icariin, epimedin A, epimedin B, and epimedin C were identified as baohuoside I (one of two), sagittatoside A, sagittatoside B, and 2 "-O-rhamnosylicariside II, respectively. Conclusions: The results showed that lactase phlorizin hydrolase was a major determinant of the intestinal absorption of prenylated flavonoids present in Yinyanghuo...|$|R
40|$|Enteric viruses are a {{major cause}} of {{diarrhea}} in children, especially those under five years old. Identifying the viral agents is critical to the development of effective preventive measures. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and genetic diversity of common enteric viruses in children under five years old in Burkina Faso. Stool samples from children with (n = 263) and without (n = 50) diarrhea disorders were collected in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso from November 2011 to September 2012. Rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus, adenovirus and Aichivirus A were detected using real-time or end-point (RT-) PCR. Rotavirus strains were G and P genotyped by multiplex RT-PCR and other viral strains were characterized by sequencing of viral subgenomic <b>segements.</b> At least one viral agent was detected in 85. 6 % and 72 % of the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, respectively. Rotavirus (63. 5 %), adenovirus (31. 2 %) and genogroup II norovirus (18. 2 %) were the most prevalent viruses in symptomatic patients, but only rotavirus and genogroup II norovirus were significantly associated with diarrhea (OR: 7. 9, 95 %CI: 3. 7 - 17; OR: 3. 5, 95 %CI: 1 - 11. 7, respectively). Sapovirus (10. 3 %), astrovirus (4. 9 %), genogroup I norovirus (2. 7 %) and Aichivirus A (0. 8 %) were less prevalent. The predominant genotype of rotavirus was G 9 P[8] (36. 5 %), and the predominant norovirus strain was GII. 4 variant 2012 (71. 4 %). Among sapovirus, the genogroup II (87. 5 %) predominated. Astrovirus type 1 (41. 7 %) was the most frequent astrovirus identified. Aichivirus A belonged to the three genotypes (A, B and C). Enteric adenoviruses type 40 and 41 were identified in 10. 2 % and 5. 1 % respectively. Several cases of co-infections were detected. The results highlight the high prevalence and the high diversity of enteric viruses in Burkinabe children...|$|R
