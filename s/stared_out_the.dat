According to his sister, when G.B. was six weeks old, his sight was damaged when he <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window at bright snow for several hours. While he was mostly blind his entire life, he could {{identify}} some people from their size and could tell time using a watch with large numbers.

5000|$|Just {{after this}} time Gilberto's father, upset by João's bizarre singing style and refusal to take [...] "normal" [...] work, {{committed}} {{him to a}} mental hospital. In a psychological interview there, Gilberto <b>stared</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and remarked, “Look at the wind depilating the trees”. The psychologist replied, “But trees have no hair, João”, to which Gilberto responded, “And {{there are people who}} have no poetry”. He was released after a week. The next year (1956) he returned to Rio and struck up old acquaintances, most significantly Antônio Carlos Jobim, who was by then working as a composer, producer and arranger with Odeon Records. Jobim was impressed with Gilberto's new style of guitar playing, and set about finding a suitable song to pitch the style to Odeon management.|$|E
