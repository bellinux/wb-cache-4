Later, Doggett awakens in the tunnels. In the dark corner of the cavern, the woman kneels beside the dead soul eater.

25|$|For {{more than}} a decade since the Bringing Them Home report was {{submitted}} to Liberal Prime Minister John Howard, he and his coalition colleagues consistently rejected calls for a formal government apology, though some coalition government members stated that they were personally <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> outcomes of the policy.

25|$|Other computer-generated {{imagery in}} the film {{includes}} the ant coming out of Dae-su's arm (according to the making-of on the DVD the whole arm was CGI) and the ants crawling over him afterwards. The octopus being eaten alive was not computer-generated; four were used during the making of this scene. Actor Choi Min-sik, a Buddhist, said a prayer for each one. The eating of squirming octopuses (called san-nakji (산낙지) in Korean) as a delicacy exists in East Asia, although it is usually killed and cut, not eaten whole and alive. Usually, it is the nerve activity in the octopus' tentacles makes the pieces still squirming posthumously on the plate when served. When asked in DVD commentary if he felt sorry for Choi, director Park Chan-wook stated he felt more <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> octopus.|$|E

If people look at it in full speed you will see that it was an instinctive reaction.|$|E
