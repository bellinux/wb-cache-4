The five large <b>submarine</b> <b>valleys</b> traversing the shelf do not continuously grade seaward, but contain elongated, closed basins.

Radiocarbon dates on the silty-clay to clayey-silt sediments from cores of the northeastern Laptev Sea indicate average sedimentation intensity of 2 to 15 mg/cm 2 /yr. The presence of manganese nodules and crusts in surface samples from less than 55 m depths and a general decrease in total foraminiferal abundances with depth in the cores suggest that the present deposition rate is less than when sea level was lower. The main components of the shelf deposits are near- shore sediments which were spread over the shelf as Holocene sea level fluctuated and marine currents distributed modern fine sediment. Rare silty-sand layers and the coarser nuclei of the manganese crusts and nodules indicate ice rafting.

The valley remains similar to 70 m deep and 7 km wide at 800 km from the Tanzania coast. Morphological comparison with worldwide submarine channels show that the Tanzania channel {{is one of the largest}} known <b>submarine</b> <b>valleys.</b> This discovery brings new light on development of <b>submarine</b> <b>valleys</b> that drain sediments originated from the East African Rift System (EARS) highlands (i. e. the Tanzania channel and its neighbor Zambezi channel located similar to 1000 km southward). Both of the systems have a morphology markedly different to the classical sinuous, V-shaped channels located at similar latitudes (e. g. the Zaire or Amazon channels). Their submarine drainage system consists of a downslope converging tributary canyons joining a central trunk channel in the continental rise. The presence of such giant deep-sea drainage systems is probably linked to a strong structural control on the sediment pathway, associated to a massive sediment transfer towards the Indian Ocean in relation with the tectonic activity of the East African Rift System (i. e. the uplift periods trough mid-Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene times) and its interplay with the East African equatorial climate changes...|$|R
40|$|Recent multibeam {{bathymetry}} and {{acoustic imagery}} data provide {{a new understanding}} of the morphology of {{the western part of the}} Gulf of Cadiz.

Channels occur on the continental shelf but are presently disconnected from the deeper network of channels and valleys. Slumps are localized in steep slope areas. They are caused by oversteepening and overloading, sometimes probably associated with earthquake activity. Slumps transform sharply into turbidity currents, depositing turbidites on the floor of deep valleys.

The echofacies/backscatter facies show an alongslopesediment distribution forming successive strips. The {{upper part of}} the uppermost slope corresponds tothe alternation of several submerged coral terraces and escarpments that could be related to LateQuaternary sea-level variations. The terraces could either be related to periods of stagnating sea-level orslow-down in sea-level change and therefore increased erosion by waves, or periods of accelerated sealevelrise since the Last Glacial Maximum. Terraces could therefore be related to coral construction anddrowing. The medium part corresponds to the marginal escarpment, a steep cemented area. The lowerpart of the uppermost slope shows a discontinuous Holocene sediment wedge with varying thicknessbetween 0 and 35 m. It is separated from the upper part by a zone of well-cemented seafloor associatedwith the marginal escarpment. Passing cold fronts result in sediment export caused by density cascading. The associated sediment fall-out and convective sedimentation can generate density currents that formthis wedge and eventually flow through linear structures on the upper slope. The survey reveals thepresence of recently active channels that extend over the entire uppermost slope and interrupt thewedge.

5000|$|The extreme {{complexity}} of most turbidite systems and beds has promoted {{the development of}} quantitative models of turbidity current behaviour inferred solely from their deposits. Small-scale laboratory experiments therefore offer {{one of the best}} means of studying their dynamics. Mathematical models can also provide significant insights into current dynamics. In the long term numerical techniques are most likely the best hope of understanding and predicting three-dimensional turbidity current processes and deposits. In most cases there are more variables than governing equations and the models rely upon simplifying assumptions in order to achieve a result. The accuracy of the individual models thus depends upon the validity and choice of the assumptions made. Experimental results provide a means of constraining some of these variables as well as providing a test for such models. [...] Physical data from field observations, or more practical from experiments, are still required in order to test the simplifying assumptions necessary in mathematical models. Most of what is known about large natural turbidity currents (i.e. those significant in terms of sediment transfer to the deep sea) is inferred from indirect sources, such as submarine cable breaks and heights of deposits above <b>submarine</b> <b>valley</b> floors.

40|$|Thesis, (M. S.) Geological SciencesThe {{continental}} slope due west of Ensenada. Baja California, Mexico, is transected by an east-west trending <b>submarine</b> <b>valley</b> {{characterized by a}} flat floor and steep-walled, constricted mouth. Calcareous olive-green silts, containing abundant sand-size glauconitic grains, were deposited during Late Pleistocene time from turbid suspensions flowing across the valley floor. Geomorphic lineaments and sub-bottom acoustic relection profiles suggest that the <b>submarine</b> <b>valley</b> is a wedge-shaped graben that has undergone recurrent faulting along its northern boundary. Based on a microfossil assemblage, including foraminifers and calcareous nannoplankton, a calcareous ooze {{from the top of}} the {{continental slope}} is correlated with the Miocene Globorotalia ???fohsi??? Zone (s. l.) of Caribbean stratigraphy. Discrete layers of red radiolarian chert fragments occur in the ooze and are lithologically similar to chert from the Franciscan Group (s. l.) of California. Sedimentary aprons and fans at the base of the continental slope are characterized by Late Pleistocene gray silts and clays, including turbidity current deposits, that are overlain by postglacial, tan calcareous silts and clays. Climatic changes indicated by Globigerina pachyderma coiling ratios in these sediments agree well with established glacial, sea level, and lake level fluctuations during Main Wisconsin and post-glacial time in middle latitudes of North America. Olive-green clayey silts were deposited at sill depth along the northern end of Long Basin during post-glacial time at a rate approximately one-fourth that evidenced on the basin floor. Areal sedimentation in the study area during the Pleistocene Epoch was characterized by non-deposition and/or erosion on Patton Ridge, and fault-triggered sediment slumps and slides in the <b>submarine</b> <b>valley.</b> Sediment suspensions, associated with mass-movements, flowed across and down valley depositing glauconite-rich sand, silt, and clay along the valley floor and forming an alluvial fan at the valley mouth.

40|$|It is {{important}} for elucidation of the glacial history to know the effect of crustal movement on glacial landforms in Antarctica, because, for example, {{the reconstruction of the}} expanded former ice sheet depends considerably on the altitudes of glaciated mountains which might have been affected more or less by crustal movement. It is highly difficult, however, to estimate the effect and time of crustal movement in Antarctica because of the difficulty in obtaining adequate data. The situation in Eastern Queen Maud Land differs little. However, the author attempts to collect information on tectonic/structural landforms in order to contribute to future investigations. 1) In the inland Yamato Mountains region, recent radio-echo sounding data seem to support the view that the mountains are the block mountains bounded by faultlines on their east and west sides. The mountains may be composed of two tilted blocks separated by a large outlet glacier, both inclined to the north, viewed mainly from distribution of the summit levels of flat or gentle surfaces. The relationship between the surface altitudes of the reconstructed former ice sheet and the glaciated summit altitudes of the mountains suggests that the mountains have been uplifted by about 500 m since the ice sheet flooded the mountains. 2) In the Lutzow-Holm Bay region, large- and meso-scale topography comprising the embayment, the Riiser-Larsen Peninsula to Gunnerus Ridge rise, and <b>submarine</b> <b>valleys</b> would have been influenced greatly by a large fault system.

40|$|Sediment {{sampling}} and shallow seismic profiling {{in the western}} and northern Barents Sea show that the bedrock in regions with less than 300 m water depth is unconformably overlain by only a thin veneer (< 10 m) of sediments. Bedrock exposures are probably common in these areas. The sediments consist of a Holocene top unit, 0. 1 - 1. 5 m in thickness, grading into Late Weichselian glaciomarine sediments. Based on average sedimentation rates (14 C-dating) of the Holocene sediments, the transition between the two units is estimated to 10, 00 ~ 12, 000 B. P. The glaciomarine sediments are commonly 1 - 3 m in thickness and underlain by stiff pebbly mud, interpreted as till and/or glaciomarine sediments overrun by a glacier. In regions where the water depth is over 300 m the sediment thickness increases, exceeding 500 m near the shelf edge {{at the mouth of}} Bj 0 rnByrenna. In Bjbrn 0 yrenna itself the uppermost 15 - 20 m seem to consist of soft glaciomarine sediments underlain by a well-defined reflector, probably the surface of the stiff pebbly mud.

40|$|Sediment {{delivery}} to the abyssal {{regions of the}} oceans is an integral process in the source to sink cycle of material derived from the hinterland. How sediments are transported down-slope, {{and where they are}} deposited has implications for the mass balance of the upper lithosphere, hydrocarbon reserves, climate archives and sequence stratigraphic models. The Zambezi River, the largest in southern Africa, delivers vast amounts of material to the continental shelf, submarine Sofala/Zambesia Bank. The Sofala/Zambesia Bank acts as a staging area for this riverine input prior to its redistribution toward the abyssal plains of the Mozambique Channel. Much of this material is said to be directed into the <b>submarine</b> Zambezi <b>Valley</b> and Channel. Until this study, however, the sediment transfer routes between the Sofala/Zambesia Bank and abyssal plains of the Mozambique Channel have been quite poorly understood and remain unconstrained. The aim of this contribution is to better constrain sediment transport pathways to the abyssal plains using the latest, regional, high resolution multibeam bathymetry data available, taking into account the effects of bottom water circulation, antecedent basin morphology and sea level change. Results show that sediment transport and {{delivery to}} the abyssal plains is discreetly partitioned into southern, central and northern domains. This sediment partitioning is primarily controlled by changes in continental shelf and shelf break morphology under the influence of a dynamic anticyclonic inshore circulation system. However, changes in base level have an overarching control on sediment delivery to particular domains at various sea levels. A direct consequence of these controlling factors is limited sediment delivery to the <b>submarine</b> Zambezi <b>Valley</b> and Channel under present-day conditions, with increased activity envisaged during regression. Furthermore, the “on-off” switching of discrete domains along strike is a sequence stratigraphic concept generally not previously considered in the shelf-slope-abyssal continuum.

40|$|Fourty one bottom {{sediment}} samples for mechanical and faunal analyses {{were collected from}} {{the western part of}} the Chijiwa Bay which covers an about 60 sq. km area off Mogi, Nagasaki City. The {{bottom sediment}}s were divided into four sediment types and their areal distributions are shown in figure 5. A narrow belt of sandy silt classed as Type III is found in the western half of the shllow <b>submarine</b> <b>valley</b> and separates the near- and offshore sandy sediments classed as Type II or IIIa. Fourty two pelecypod molluscan species which are listed in Table 2 were discriminated from the unit sediment samples (200 cc wet volume sediment) and eight predominant species were selected as shown in Table 3. The dominant molluscan remains were found in the silty sand of Type IIIa which represents a transition between muddy and sandy sediments...|$|E
40|$|IX° Congrès International de Sédimentologie, Sedim-Nice- 1975. The Annot Sandstone Formation, a thick marine {{sequence}} of Uppermost Eocene te Lower Oligocene {{age in the}} Maritime Alps of France and Italy, presents remarkably well -exposed massive sandstone, pebbly sandstone and pebbly mudstone sequences associated with the more classic alternating sandstone turbidite-shale flysch facies associated with this formation. The purpose of this presentation is to review the salient characteristics of these coarse, shoe-string bodies interpreted as <b>submarine</b> <b>valley</b> deposits, and to examine details of channel (including submarine canyon) fill, <b>submarine</b> <b>valley</b> wall, intervalley slope and submarine fan lithofacies. The interrelation of these facies {{in space and time}} is observed, and an interpretation is made of the dominant processes responsible for the transport of sediment from basin margins ta deeper environments. A bathyal depth is indicated by ichnofossil assemblages and additional sedimentological evidence. Formulation of a submarine canyon sedimentation model, based in part on studies in modern canyons, is made using as example the channelized sandflow and related deposits at the Annot, Contes and Menton localities. In contrast, facies observed in the more distal localities to the north (Lac d 'Allos, Peïra-Cava and Sospel regions) display fewer and thinner massive units and a higher proportion of turbidites and shales; these sequences are interpreted in terrns of the now reasonably well-defined submarine fan sedimentation models. Exarnples of both inner and more distal outer fan facies are distinguished. Mapping of the canyon to fan transition provides greater precision to the Annot Basin paleogeographie interpretations. Furtherrnore, these channel deposits, unusual in the sense that *they-can be traced so clearly laterally along paleoslopes afford a rare opportunity te observe the downslope transforrnation of subaqueous flow mechanisms (i. e., slump, debris flow and diverse sand flow processes including grain/fluidized and turbidity currents). The massive sandstone units of Annot Sandstone examined here are designated as a type example of the submarine canyon-fan valley continuum...|$|E
40|$|The Neoproterozoic outcrop belt of the Death Valley region, California, {{preserves}} {{an oblique}} {{cross section of}} the Noonday Formation, a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic platform that hosts distinctive basal Ediacaran cap carbonate−affiliated sedimentary structures, stromatolite textures, and δ^(13) C_(carb) values. The Noonday platform encompasses two depositional sequences that reveal two cycles of relative sea-level change within strata conventionally considered to record a single, rapid, postglacial sea-level rise. In updip localities, facies of the first depositional sequence record the transition from a carbonate ramp to a stromatolite-bearing, “tubestone”-textured, reef-rimmed platform; downdip, localities seaward of the reefal escarpment variably preserve a thin and condensed onlapping foreslope wedge. Base-level fall exposed the reef crest to karstic dissolution and propagated <b>submarine</b> incised <b>valleys</b> into the seaward margin of the reef. Overlying strata record the backfilling of a <b>submarine</b> incised <b>valley</b> and reestablishment of a back-stepping, carbonate-dominated ramp prior to a second subaerial exposure event that defines the contact between the Noonday and Johnnie formations. We address the relative contributions of syndepositional tectonism and recovery from low-latitude deglaciation in dictating Noonday platform architecture and the intra−Noonday Formation sequence boundary. Noonday Formation deposition coincided with extension of the Laurentian margin during disaggregation of the Rodinian supercontinent. Within this framework, previous work has suggested that the intra−Noonday Formation sequence boundary records growth faulting that reinforced differential topography, uplifting reef-rimmed horsts—exposing the reef crest to karstic dissolution—and downdropping grabens. However, we trace the intra−Noonday Formation sequence boundary seaward of the reef crest and demonstrate that, for a time, wave base was situated downdip of the reef escarpment on putatively downdropped fault blocks. Thus, if the Noonday margin were undergoing extension, then the creation of the intra−Noonday Formation sequence boundary required a concomitant decrease in accommodation due, perhaps, to postglacial isostatic uplift attendant with low-latitude deglaciation. We speculate that Noonday Formation sequence architecture records (1) immediate deglacial flooding, (2) shoaling and exposure due to isostatic rebound induced by either a hiatus in meltwater flux or rapid ice-sheet collapse against a background of global deglaciation, and (3) resumed flooding following complete deglaciation. As rift-related tectonism could amplify or counter glacial isostasy, inferences of the amplitude of local postglacial sea-level change will require robust estimates of syndepositional extension across the Noonday margin...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{engineering}} geological {{study was}} undertaken {{to determine the}} geotechnical properties and mineralogy of Singapore marine clay at Changi in the Republic of Singapore. This soft soil is a quartenary deposit that lies within <b>submarine</b> <b>valleys</b> cut in an old alluvium formation. The marine clay comprises a soft upper marine clay layer overlying a stiffer lower marine clay layer. An intermediate stiff clay layer is sandwiched between these two marine clay layers; it {{is believed to be}} the dessicated crust of the lower marine clay layer. In the present study, morphological and mineralogical observations of Singapore clay were taken by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and photographic identification. The geotechnical investigation included physical, compression, permeability and field vane shear tests. The upper marine clay was found to be soft with undrained shear strength values ranging from 10 to 30 kPa, while the lower marine clay was found to have undrained shear strength values from 30 to 60 kPa. The sensitivity of the marine clay at Changi varied from 3 to 8 and is described as highly sensitive marine clay. The upper clay layer had a coefficient of consolidation of 0. 47 – 0. 6 m 2 /year due to the vertical flow (cv) and a coefficient of consolidation of 2 – 3 m 2 /year due to the horizontal flow (ch). The lower marine clay had a cv of 0. 8 – 1. 5 m 2 /year and a ch of 3 – 5 m 2 /year, while the intermediate stiff clay had a cv of 1 – 4. 5 m 2 /year and a ch of 5 – 10 m 2 /year. The primary clay mineral was kaolinite, followed by smectite and mica. With this high kaolinite content, the activity of the Singapore marine clay was found to be low at approximately 0. 5 – 1. 3 and classified as inactive to active clay. With reference to the intrinsic state line, natural Singapore clay (upper, intermediate and lower layers) has been classified as structured clay and is in a meta-stable state. The compression behaviour can be modelled by the Intrinsic State Line and the destructuring framework. The predicted and the measured compression curves were comparable for various depths. The successful modelling of compression curves will be useful for settlement calculations and for further research on the development of a constitutive model for Singapore marine clay...|$|R
