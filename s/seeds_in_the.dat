5|$|An English trader, Charles Ledger, and his Amerindian servant {{spent four}} years {{collecting}} cinchona <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Andes in Bolivia, highly prized for their quinine but whose export was prohibited. Ledger managed to get seeds out; in 1865, the Dutch government cultivated 20,000 trees of the Cinchona ledgeriana in Java (Indonesia). By {{the end of the}} nineteenth century, the Dutch had established a world monopoly over its supply.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{begins its}} breeding season {{later in the}} year than any other finch and later than any other native North American bird, besides occasionally the sedge wren. This {{may be related to the}} abundance of <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late summer months, as seeds represent the majority of their diet.|$|E
5|$|When {{there is}} more pollen applied to the stigma, more seeds are {{produced}} in the fruits and the fruits are larger with greater likelihood of maturation, an effect called xenia. Competitively grown specimens are therefore often hand-pollinated to maximize the number of <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fruit, which increases the fruit size; this pollination requires skilled technique. Seedlessness is known to occur in certain cultivars of C.pepo.|$|E

5|$|A precise {{description}} {{and interpretation of}} the work has remained elusive since its initial discovery in the 19th century. Scholars agree on some aspects and disagree on others. British Greek art scholar Martin Robertson notes that both women can be seen wearing the tubular peplos garment common to the Classical period. According to the descriptive text found in the Atlas database of the exhibited works of art at the Louvre, the women also are wearing a kekryphalos, a hairnet in the Greco-Roman hairstyle, and appear to hold a type of flower, perhaps poppy or pomegranate. One {{of the women in}} the stele carries what resembles a bag, presumed to be carrying <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Carolina wrens {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their time on or near the ground searching for food, or in tangles of vegetation and vines. They also probe bark crevices on lower tree levels, or pick up leaf-litter in order to search for prey. Their diet consists of invertebrates, such as beetles, true bugs, grasshoppers, katydids, spiders, ants, bees, and wasps. Small lizards and tree frogs also make up the carnivorous portion of their diet. Vegetable matter makes up a small percentage of their diets, such as fruit pulp and various <b>seeds.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> northern portion of their range, they frequent bird feeders.|$|E
5|$|The {{fieldfare}} (Turdus pilaris) is {{a member}} of the thrush family Turdidae. It breeds in woodland and scrub in northern Europe and Asia. It is strongly migratory, with many northern birds moving south during the winter. It is a very rare breeder in the British Isles, but winters in large numbers in the United Kingdom, Southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of molluscs, insects and earthworms in the summer, and berries, grain and <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter.|$|E
50|$|The Orlando Waves debuted on November 5, 2016 {{against the}} St. Petersburg Tide at the Kissimmee Civic Center winning with a 131-114 score.

5|$|The fruits {{produced}} by cacti after the flowers have been fertilized vary considerably; many are fleshy, although some are dry. All contain {{a large number}} of seeds. Fleshy, colorful and sweet-tasting fruits are associated with seed dispersal by birds. The seeds pass through their digestive systems and are deposited in their droppings. Fruit that falls to the ground may be eaten by other animals; giant tortoises are reported to distribute Opuntia <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gal√°pagos Islands. Ants appear to disperse the seeds of a few genera, such as Blossfeldia. Drier spiny fruits may cling to the fur of mammals or be moved around by the wind.|$|E
5|$|The swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) {{feeds on}} the fallen fruit of P.lanceolata and disperses the seed through its scat (dung). A field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found that 88% of <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scat were still viable {{although}} dormant. The red-necked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) feeds on drupes {{and is a}} likely seed dispersal agent. Animals can convey seed {{for one or two}} kilometres from where they have fed. Rodents such as the bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) and black rat (Rattus rattus) eat the drupes but chew the seed so that only fragments leave their digestive system. Foxes have been reported to eat the fruit, and kangaroos and large birds such as currawongs are thought to as well.|$|E
5|$|Beetles can be {{beneficial}} to human economics by controlling the populations of pests. The larvae and adults of some species of lady beetles (Coccinellidae) feed on aphids that are pests. Other lady beetles feed on scale insects, whitefly and mealybugs. If normal food sources are scarce, they may feed on small caterpillars, young plant bugs, or honeydew and nectar. Ground beetles (Carabidae) are common predators of many insect pests, including fly eggs, caterpillars, and wireworms. Ground beetles can help to control weeds by eating their <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soil, reducing the need for herbicides to protect crops. The effectiveness of some species in reducing certain plant populations {{has resulted in the}} deliberate introduction of beetles in order to control weeds. For example, the genus Zygogramma is native to North America but has been used to control Parthenium hysterophorus in India and Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Russia.|$|E

5|$|Conroy was the Flames second-leading scorer in 2002‚Äì03 with 59 {{points and}} again in 2003‚Äì04 when he scored 47 points despite missing 19 games with a knee injury. Shortly before the 2003-04 season began, Conroy gave up the {{captaincy}} after having {{decided it was time}} for Iginla to take over leadership of the team. He reached two milestones that season; he scored his 300th career point against the Vancouver Canucks on November 29, 2003 and played his 600th game against the Detroit Red Wings on March 16, 2004. The Flames qualified for the 2004 playoffs, their first trip to the post-season in eight seasons. Conroy was a key player for the team as they upset the top three <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western Conference, the Canucks, Red Wings and San Jose Sharks en route to a seventh game loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Stanley Cup Final. He finished second on the team in playoff scoring with 17 points. Following the season, Conroy was named to play with Team USA at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, but appeared in only two games for the team.|$|E
5|$|Farming in Egypt was {{dependent}} on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: Akhet (flooding), Peret (planting), and Shemu (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the growing season lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops. From March to May, farmers used sickles to harvest their crops, which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain. Winnowing removed the chaff from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.|$|E
5|$|These sparrows feed {{primarily}} on <b>seeds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter and insects {{in the spring}} and summer. The birds are often territorial, with males guarding their territory through song and displays. Flight is awkward for this species, which prefers to hop along the ground for locomotion. They are monogamous and breed during spring. Two to five eggs are laid in the bird's nest, which is cup-shaped and well hidden. Adult sparrows are preyed upon by house cats and small raptors, while young may be taken by a range of mammals and reptiles. They have been known to live for up to three years, two months. Although the species has been classified as least concern, or unthreatened with extinction, some subspecies are threatened by habitat destruction and one may be extinct.|$|E
