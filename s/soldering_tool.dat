This master thesis describes the method and steps that were done to complete a superconducting field winding and how it was tested. Ten MgB 2 double pancake coils were glued together with a thermally conductive epoxy on a thermal interface. The coils were joined electrically by a validated procedure that makes low resistance joints by using a custom made <b>soldering</b> <b>tool.</b> BSCCO high temperature superconductors were soldered {{at each end of the}} field winding to lead the current from the high temperature stage of the cryostat to the field winding. A mechanical support placed around the field winding was designed to withstand the magnetic forces acting on the field winding during testing. The field winding was placed in a cryostat and cooled down to 17. 7 K for testing. Seven out of ten coils were proved to be superconductive. Coil 1, 6, 10 and the BSCCO HTS were not superconductive as a voltage was measured when a current was flowing through the field winding. The quality of the joints was validated by measuring the voltage over each joint and calculating the resistance. The average resistance of the joints was 40 nOhms where the highest resistance was 110 nOhms. 15 mW of heat would be dissipated in the joints when testing with a current of 200 A.

40|$|This paper {{examined}} {{utilization of}} electricity in electrical and electronics workshop {{as perceived by}} undergraduate students in Nigeria. Electrical and electronics are practical and activity oriented subjects that require electricity to function effectively in the workshop and laboratories.

Despite the importance of electricity supply for the operation of these workshop equipment in Nigeria, it appears that electricity supply remain a mirage in our school workshop due epileptic power supply in Nigeria.

40|$|In high {{pressure}} die casting (HPDC) process of aluminium alloys cast alloy <b>soldering</b> severely damages <b>tool</b> surfaces. It hampers casting ejection, reduces the casting quality and decreases the overall production efficiency. Thin ceramic PVD (physical vapor deposition) coatings applied on tool surfaces successfully reduce these effects. However, their performance is still not recognised for surfaces with various topographies. In this investigation, soldering tendency of Al-Si-Cu alloy toward EN X 27 CrMoV 51 steel, plasma nitrided steel, CrN and TiAlN duplex PVD coatings is evaluated using ejection test. The coatings were prepared {{to a range of}} surface roughness and topographies. After the tests sample surfaces were analysed by different microscopy techniques and profilometry. It was found that the ejection performance is independent of the chemical composition of investigated materials. After the ejection, the cast alloy soldering layer was found on surfaces of all tested materials. This built-up layer formed by effects of mechanical soldering, without corrosion reactions. Coated samples displayed a pronounced dependence of ejection force on surface roughness and topography. By decreasing roughness, ejection force increased, which is a consequence of intensified adhesion effects.

40|$|During {{high-pressure}} die-casting (HPDC) {{of aluminium}} alloys, {{there is a}} tendency for the molten alloy to react with the tool steel die, core pins and inserts. This occurrence within the high pressure die casting (HPDC) industry is referred to as ‘soldering’. It is of concern to high-pressure die casters because of down-time due to the regular removal of the soldered layer and its detrimental affect on die life and casting quality. In this investigation, several physical vapour deposited (PVD) coatings, namely, TiN, CrN and TiCN, were evaluated for their ability to eliminate soldering during HPDC of aluminium alloys. Accelerated semi-industrial trials were carried out in a 250 -t Toshiba HPDC machine using a specially designed die made of P 20 tool steel with removable core pins. The results from these trials showed that PVD coatings can act as a physical barrier coating preventing any reaction between the molten aluminium alloy and the tool steel. Thus the problem of <b>soldering</b> on such <b>tools</b> as core pins can be eliminated in high HPDC of aluminium alloys. In the accelerated trials, it was found that soldering was replaced by a built-up layer of cast aluminium alloy, which was less detrimental to tool life and reduced machine down-time due to the reduced need for tool polishing. The experimental results were confirmed by conducting in-plant HPDC trials...|$|R
40|$|People {{never seem}} to have enough hands. There are many tools that aim to address this challenge, ranging from the {{ubiquitous}} benchtop vise to the "helping hands" commonly used for <b>soldering.</b> However, these <b>tools</b> do not measure up to their human counterparts. They cannot adjust the position or orientation of the workpiece to suit a particular task which can cause workers to maintain unhealthy postures that are detrimental to their long-term health. This thesis addresses this shortcoming with a robotic arm that utilizes a gripper to grasp and hold a workpiece during a soldering task. The robot uses a Microsoft Kinect sensor to continuously analyze the posture of the human worker and calculate a score based on the RULA (Rapid Upper Limb Assessment), an objective measure used in the ergonomics field to evaluate ergonomic working postures. The robot adjusts the workpiece in order to optimize the RULA score using an adaptive simulated annealing algorithm to balance the exploration and exploitation phases of the optimization process. Initial testing indicates that the robot can consistently find positions which improve the RULA ranking by 24. 6 % of the measured range. This project demonstrates that human robot collaboration can be improved by utilizing sensors to evaluate {{the needs of a}} human partner and adjust the robot behavior accordingly. by Moses Teddy Ort.
