25|$|Chomsky's {{political}} writings {{have largely}} {{been focused on the}} two concepts of ideology and power, or the media and state policy. One of Chomsky's best-known works, Manufacturing Consent, dissects the media's role in reinforcing and acquiescing to state policies, across the political spectrum, while marginalizing contrary perspectives. Chomsky claims that this 'free-market' version of censorship is more subtle and difficult to undermine than the equivalent propaganda system that was present in the Soviet Union. As he argues, the mainstream press is corporate owned and thus reflects corporate priorities and interests. Although acknowledging that many American journalists are dedicated and well-meaning, he argues that the choice of topics and issues featured in the mass media, the unquestioned premises on which that coverage rests, and the range of opinions that are expressed are all constrained to reinforce the state's ideology. He states that, although the mass media will criticize individual politicians and political parties, it will not undermine the wider state-corporate nexus of which it is a part. As evidence, he highlights that the U.S. mass media does not employ any socialist journalists or political commentators. He also points to examples of important news <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been ignored by U.S. mainstream media because reporting on them would reflect badly upon the U.S. state: For instance, it ignored the murder of Black Panther Fred Hampton with possible FBI involvement, the massacres perpetrated in Nicaragua by the U.S.-funded Contras, and the constant reporting on Israeli deaths while ignoring the far larger number of Palestinian deaths in the conflict between those two nations.|$|E

BBC News described the plot as an ongoing [...] "predatory paedophile storyline", noting that {{this was the first time}} this subject matter had been tackled by a UK soap opera. The storyline was conceived when EastEnders series consultant Simon Ashdown viewed a documentary about homelessness, featuring a mother and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go. Ashdown questioned what might happen if a paedophile were to befriend the mother in order to grow closer to the child, and related the scenario to Bianca's return to the soap. BBC Head of Drama John Yorke explained that the idea when presented [...] "drew a sharp intake of breath.

The big moments in EastEnders, those iconic pieces of television history, tend to be the things that are incredibly near the knuckle, and are actually quite difficult subjects to raise {{in the context of a}} family sitting room. [...] Soaps are meant to hold up a mirror to our lives, and sometimes that mirror will show ugly bits, difficult bits, taboo bits. But if a soap doesn't hold up that mirror, then actually, what is it? It will have no depth." ...|$|E

That year, Cameron {{stated that the}} sequels were being written as [...] "separate <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> an overall arc inclusive of the first film", with the second having a clear conclusion instead of a cliffhanger to the next film. Cameron expected to release Avatar 2 in 2015. In 2013, {{it was confirmed that}} there would be three sequels. Screenwriters were also announced: Josh Friedman for the first, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver for the second, and Shane Salerno for the third. Production was rescheduled for 2014 with the films to be released in December 2016, 2017, and 2018. Steven Gould was engaged to write four novels based on the films. Later that year, Cameron announced that the sequels would be filmed in New Zealand, with performance capture to take place in 2014. An agreement with the New Zealand government required at least one world premiere to be held in Wellington and at least NZ$500 million (approximately US$410 million at December 2013 exchange rates) to be spent on production activity in New Zealand, including live-action filming and visual effects. The New Zealand government announced it would raise its baseline tax rebate for filmmaking from 15% to 20%, with 25% available to international productions in some cases and 40% for New Zealand productions (as defined by section 18 of the New Zealand Film Commission Act 1978).|$|E

2500|$|Amlaíb's byname, cuarán, {{is usually}} {{translated}} as [...] "sandal" [...] or [...] "shoe". It {{derives from the}} Old Irish word cúar meaning bent or crooked.

The epithet probably refers to a distinctive style of footwear. Benjamin Hudson points to the description of a cuarán in a twelfth-century satire, where it is made of leather folded seven times and has a pointed toe. In Aislinge Meic Con Glinne and Scél Baili Binnbérlaig, the cuarán is waterproof. In the first story Mac Con Glinne cleans his by dipping them in his bath; in the second, a cuarán serves as a vessel to drink from.

2500|$|In modern {{anthropology}} {{studying the}} Muisca and {{the tales of}} the conquistadors, especially Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, whose writings are the only primary sources that survived, efforts {{have been made to}} revise the descriptions of the Muisca. The early Spanish chroniclers have written about cannibalism of various indigenous groups, <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> later been refuted by experts. Also the idea that the Muisca were a war-like people has been revised in the modern age, pointing to their successful trading, that even the Spanish scholars, such as first bishop of Bogotá Juan de los Barrios, have praised in their writings. Various other researchers have taken caution in taking the early ethnographic accountson the warfare status as unambiguously true. In early texts, the Muisca were described as having to pay tributes to the caciques, an idea explained to be misunderstood, by anthropologist Carl Henrik Langebaek. All the conquistadors and later writers such as Pedro de Aguado, Pedro Simón, Juan Rodríguez Freyle, Juan de Castellanos and Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita were men, introducing sexism into the history books. Many modern archaeologists and anthropologists of the Muisca are female and have revised the role of the women in Muisca society, with Sylvia Broadbent, Ana María Groot, Marianne Cardale de Schrimpff and many others as notable examples. Also the description of the Muisca Confederation as a stratified empire has been revised, most notably by Jorge Gamboa Mendoza. The [...] "stone fortress" [...] that has been described in Cajicá by Spanish chroniclers may have been built after the conquest. Misunderstandings about the Muisca originated from the difficulties in language; the Spanish used indigenous translators taken captive on their route and brought along from the coast, introducing errors in the understanding of the Chibcha of the Muisca, that in many cases {{is very different from the}} other Chibchan languages. The word for [...] "one" [...] in Muysccubun is ata, while in the closest related Chibchan languages of Colombia [...] "one" [...] translates as úbistia (Uwa), intok (Barí) and ti-tasu or nyé (Chimila).|$|E
2500|$|Bianca's {{most notable}} initial storyline upon her return was a {{paedophilia}} plot revolving around Bianca's partner Tony King (Chris Coghill), and her 15 year old step daughter, Whitney. According to the Daily Mail, the storyline {{has been dubbed}} as the [...] "most controversial story-line on the show ever". The idea for the storyline was conceptualised by writer Simon Ashdown and other scriptwriters, when they were brainstorming ideas for Bianca's return to EastEnders. They had seen a documentary about homelessness and had been struck by {{an image of a}} woman and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go, a scene that was used to similar effect in Bianca and her family's return episode. They considered the homeless family's predicament and were left pondering [...] "What might happen to them? They would be easy prey... What if a paedophile noticed the child, who might be, say, 12, and pretended to be the woman's saviour? She would be too grateful to notice that this was unusual behaviour, that he seemed to have few friends or family". They pitched the idea to John Yorke, controller of BBC drama production, who said that [...] "It drew a sharp intake of breath. Most EastEnders <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for." [...] However, paedophilia as a storyline had been pitched before, but the idea had been vetoed because they could not find the right storyline and characters to proceed and, as the topic was so controversial, producers had been unwilling to take the risk. Diederick Santer commented, [...] "We knew that something like 16% of under-16s have been sexually abused at some point, but if you can't find a story, it's an issue that sits there, dead, on the show." [...] It has been noted in the media that paedophilia is a subject rarely shown on pre-watershed terrestrial television, and although EastEnders had broached it in 2001 with Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) and her abusive uncle Harry (Michael Elphick), this was scripted to have happened in the past and focused on the effect it had on the victim as an adult.|$|E
