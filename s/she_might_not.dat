5|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Justin Spitzer, his 10th writing credit for the series. It was directed by series editor David Rogers, his 4th directing credit for the series. Beginning with this episode, Mindy Kaling was promoted to executive producer. Before this, it was speculated that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> return to the series as a writer. The episode features guest appearance from Stephen Collins, Dee Wallace and Josh Groban as Andy's father, mother and brother, respectively. Collins and Wallace were reported {{to appear on the}} series by Joyce Eng of TV Guide. Josh Groban was later reported to appear on the series the next day. Writer Mindy Kaling had sent Groban a message through Twitter asking if he would want to appear on the series. He responded yes with the filming week of the episode lining up with his Los Angeles concert for his Straight to You Tour.|$|E
5|$|Blaine {{gives in}} to Kurt's urgings and wishes and {{transfers}} to McKinley High {{so they can}} spend more time together during Kurt's senior year. Kurt and Rachel decide they want to apply to a top school for the dramatic arts in New York City, NYADA, but are intimidated when they meet some of their competition and decide their applications need to include more accomplishments: Rachel proposes that McKinley do West Side Story as the school musical so she can star in it, and Kurt runs for class president. Brittany volunteers to be his campaign manager, and he accepts, but when he objects to her suggestions for posters and paraphernalia as overemphasizing his sexuality, she decides {{to run for the}} office herself. Kurt tries out for the musical, but the directors aren't convinced that he's masculine enough to portray Tony, the romantic male lead, and cast Blaine instead, even though he's only a junior; Kurt is given the minor role of Officer Krupke. When Rachel believes that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be cast as Maria, the female lead, she panics and decides to run for class president as well, infuriating Kurt. She eventually withdraws and throws her support behind Kurt, and secretly decides to help him further by stuffing the ballot box in his favor. He nevertheless loses to Brittany, and Rachel is suspended from school for cheating. The same day that Kurt loses, his father wins a special congressional election against Sue.|$|E
25|$|Dame Helen Mirren {{dedicated}} her 2006 Best Actress BAFTA {{award for}} her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II {{in the film}} The Queen to Ian Richardson. In her acceptance speech she said that, without his support early in her career, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have been so successful, before breaking down and leaving the stage. Other tributes and reminiscences by Richardson's colleagues are offered in a memoir by Sharon Mail, We Could Possibly Comment: Ian Richardson Remembered (2009).|$|E

25|$|Her coach {{had advised}} her {{to hold back}} on her swim speed, {{otherwise}} <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be able to complete the race; together {{with the lack of}} power in her left arm, that meant her swim was much slower than usual at 61minutes. In contrast with her previous races at Kona, where Wellington had dominated on the bike, she started the marathon stage with five women still in front of her. Wellington's main concern, though, was Mirinda Carfrae, the 2010 champion who was only a little over three minutes behind her, and the only woman who had run faster than her on this course – a serious worry, given Wellington's injuries.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} sets of competencies for different specializations within I/O psychology and I/O psychologists are versatile behavioral scientists. For example, an I/O psychologist specializing in selection and recruiting should have expertise in finding the best talent for the organization and getting everyone on board while he or <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> need to know much about executive coaching. Some I/O psychologists specialize in specific areas of consulting whereas others tend to generalize their areas of expertise. There are basic skills and knowledge an individual needs {{in order to be}} an effective I/O psychologist, which include being an independent learner, interpersonal skills (e.g., listening skills), and general consultation skills (e.g., skills and knowledge in the problem area).|$|E
25|$|When a Caucasian {{surrogate}} mother {{gives birth to}} an African American baby, the couple for who {{she was supposed to}} carry a child for refuses to take the newborn. Rachel is {{caught in the middle of}} the madness as she tries to sort things out, but is afraid that the clinic may be sued, or shut down, by the couple. The clinic's psychologist, Lydia (Alfre Woodard), finds that her job may be in jeopardy because <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have done the proper background check on the {{surrogate mother}}. As the mother refuses to tell the truth about the baby's father and as the time gets closer for Child Services to step in and take the child, Marissa offers to adopt. However, the birth father is finally contacted and takes the baby home.|$|E
6000|$|There {{were more}} than two full hours yet to elapse before she could come, and in that interval, which seemed a long one, I must confess I was nervously anxious about my altered looks. I loved my darling so well that I was more {{concerned}} for their effect on her than on any one. I was not in this slight distress because I at all repined--I am quite certain I did not, that day--but, I thought, would she be wholly prepared? When she first saw me, <b>might</b> <b>she</b> <b>not</b> be a little shocked and disappointed? <b>Might</b> it <b>not</b> prove a little worse than <b>she</b> expected? <b>Might</b> <b>she</b> <b>not</b> look for her old Esther and <b>not</b> find her? <b>Might</b> <b>she</b> <b>not</b> have to grow used {{to me and to}} begin all over again? ...|$|R

25|$|Robertson {{reported}} to the War Cabinet (14 November) that Italy’s situation was like that of Russia in 1915 and that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> recover. In his paper “Future Military Policy” (19 November), Robertson {{was impressed by the}} French Army’s recovery under Petain but advised that lack of French reserves might make major French offensives in 1918 unlikely. He rejected a purely defensive posture in the west, as even defending would still result in heavy casualties, but was sceptical of Haig’s wish to renew the Ypres Offensive in Spring 1918, and argued that Britain should build up her strength on the Western Front and then decide on the scale of her 1918 offensives. He warned (correctly) that, with Russia dropping out of the war, the Germans would use the opportunity to attack in 1918 before the American Expeditionary Force were present in strength. Lloyd George replied (wrongly) that the Germans would not attack and would fail if they did.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} {{her part}} of the correspondence, Stone went to Illinois to visit a brother. Within days of her arrival, he died of cholera and Stone was left to settle his affairs and accompany his pregnant widow back east. Fearing <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> {{be able to return}} for three months, she wrote to Davis asking her to take charge of issuing the call. The call began appearing in September, with the convention date pushed back one week and Stone's name heading the list of eighty-nine signatories: thirty-three from Massachusetts, ten from Rhode Island, seventeen from New York, eighteen from Pennsylvania, one from Maryland, and nine from Ohio. While the call began circulating, Stone lay near death in a roadside inn. Having decided not to tarry in the disease-ridden Wabash Valley, she had begun a stage coach trek back across Indiana with her sister-in-law, and within days contracted typhoid fever that kept her bed-ridden for three weeks. She arrived back in Massachusetts in October, just two weeks before the convention.|$|E

60|$|Indeed, as {{she spoke}} she fell down insensible, and when she {{recovered}} {{she found herself in}} her own little bed at home; how she got there she could not tell, but she was dressed in the most beautiful lace and ribbons, and on her finger was a little ring, made of a single red hair, which fitted so tightly that, try as <b>she</b> <b>might,</b> <b>she</b> could <b>not</b> get it off.|$|R
500|$|Delays in the {{shooting}} schedule pushed filming into the autumn, which required the set decorators to spray-paint the autumn leaves green. The uncooperative weather then took a different turn, plunging from oppressive heat to down near , causing frigid conditions for the famous swimming scene in October. The crew wore warm coats, gloves, and boots. Swayze and Grey stripped down to light summer clothing, to repeatedly dive into the cold water. Despite her character's enjoyment, Grey later described the water as [...] "horrifically" [...] cold, and <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have gone into the lake, except that she was [...] "young and hungry".|$|E
500|$|Ferraro {{continued}} {{to engage the}} issue and criticize the Obama campaign via her position as a Fox News Channel contributor.

[...] Ferraro stated in mid- that Clinton had [...] "raised this whole woman candidate thing to a whole different level than when I ran". She thought Obama had behaved in a sexist manner and that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> vote for him.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Kaplan has {{commented on}} her harassing {{gameplay}} style, noting that: [...] characters like Tracer and Genji ... {{who are really}} unique in how Overwatch is played, and sometimes the absolute right thing for Tracer to be doing is to be off on her own, completely away from the objective or completely away from the team, harassing other players who are running back from the spawn. And <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> even be killing those players [...] She's a distracting, ambushing skirmisher. And that doesn't really fit in necessarily with objective time. [...] You can be the absolute MVP of the match when you're doing some of those things, and there's no way to really score it accurately.|$|E

500|$|When Darryl {{runs into}} Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), {{he tells her}} about the company's success and how Jim is missing out by staying in Scranton. Pam begins to worry that she is making Jim do {{something}} {{that he does not}} want to do. She confronts her husband and admits that she thinks <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be good enough for him. He asks the in-series documentary crew's help; the crew makes a DVD of the highlights that they have collected of Jim and Pam's relationship. The final scene that they use is from the second season Christmas episode [...] "Christmas Party" [...] in which Jim gives Pam a teapot as a gift, but takes back his accompanying note to her. After Pam watches the DVD, Jim presents her with the actual, unopened note. She reads it to herself, and, realizing that Jim does truly love her, the two happily embrace.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} development of Andrea produced uniform praise among critics. Jackson {{felt that it}} served as the episode's highlight, and further assessed that she emulated actress Linda Hamilton. [...] "After a season of whining, there {{had to have been}} at least a few fans pulling for the walkers in her early scenes, but she quickly became Linda Hamilton-badass, braining zombies with her foot," [...] he said. Likewise, Kine asserted that [...] "the badass she has tried so hard to convince us all she is finally came across." [...] Ryan thought that Andrea's struggle to survive was a strong way to build up the exodus of the group. She spoke of her scene with Michonne: [...] "She'd fought so hard to live that I wanted Andrea to fend off that final batch of walkers successfully. When it appeared <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> live, I was, quite rightly, {{on the edge of my}} seat. And the appearance of the caped figure—towing two armless walkers, no less—was as dramatic as could be." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Mindy Kaling, who also portrays Kelly Kapoor on the series, her 24th writing credit for the series. This marks her first writing credit as an executive producer. Before this, it was speculated that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> return to the series as a writer, before she confirmed {{that she would be}} writing the Christmas episode. She has also written the previous two Christmas episodes: [...] "Secret Santa" [...] and [...] "Classy Christmas". The episode was directed by cast member Ed Helms, making his directorial debut. The episode also marks the fourth appearance of Lindsey Broad who plays Cathy, Pam's replacement during her maternity leave. She appeared in a recurring role for the season and she initially appeared in [...] "Pam's Replacement". Due to Jenna Fischer's actual pregnancy, Pam did not appear in the episode. The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include shoots of several of the staff member's Christmas wishes being revealed, Dwight and Jim's pranks start turning on Cathy, and Meredith hitting on a newly single Robert.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year, Steiger {{portrayed the}} comic actor W. C. Fields in an Arthur Hiller biopic, W. C. Fields and Me, for Universal Pictures. The screenplay, {{which was based}} on a memoir by Carlotta Monti, who was Fields' mistress for the last 14 years of his life, was penned by Bob Merrill. Steiger read extensively about Fields in preparation for the role, and developed an encyclopaedic knowledge of his career and personal life. He concluded that he would base his characterization around his performance in The Bank Dick (1940) [...] One day, Fields' mistress Monti turned up on set, and watched the scene where he briefly thanks everybody. Nervous that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> approve, he broke down in tears after Monti met him after the scene and fondly said [...] "Woody, Woody, Woody, My Woody", a nickname used only by those very close to Fields. Despite the energy Steiger put into the picture, like the actor's previous recent films, it was poorly received by critics. Canby called it [...] "dreadful" [...] and described Steiger's portrayal of Fields as a [...] "wax dummy of a character". Lucia Bozzola of The New York Times later referred to Steiger's portrayal of Fields as [...] "superb", but noted that his Hollywood career had [...] "undeniably fallen from his 1950s and '60s heights".|$|E
500|$|When Goldsmith {{took over}} as editor, there was some concern at Ziff-Davis that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> {{be able to handle}} the job. [...] A consultant, Norman Lobsenz, was brought in to help her; Lobsenz's title was [...] "editorial director", but in fact Goldsmith made the story selections. [...] Lobsenz {{provided}} blurbs and editorials, read the stories Goldsmith bought, and met with Goldsmith every week or so. [...] Goldsmith was not a long-time sf reader, and knew little about the field; she simply looked for good quality fiction and bought what she liked. [...] In Mike Ashley's words, [...] "the result, between 1961 and 1964, was the two most exciting and original magazines in the field". [...] New writers whose first story appeared in Fantastic during this period included Phyllis Gotlieb, Larry Eisenberg, Ursula K. Le Guin, Thomas M. Disch, and Piers Anthony. [...] The November 1959 issue was dedicated to Fritz Leiber; it included [...] "Lean Times in Lankhmar", one of Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories. [...] Goldsmith published another half-dozen stories in the series over the next six years, along with other similar (and sometimes imitative) fiction such as early work by Michael Moorcock, and John Jakes' early stories of Brak the Barbarian. [...] This helped to invigorate the nascent sword and sorcery subgenre. [...] Goldsmith obtained an early story by Cordwainer Smith, [...] "The Fife of Bodidharma", which ran in the June 1959 issue, but shortly thereafter Pohl at Galaxy reached an agreement to get first refusal on all Smith's work.|$|E
