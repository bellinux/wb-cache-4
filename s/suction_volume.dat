A geometric analysis of <b>suction</b> and <b>volume</b> ratio slide valves {{is presented to}} determine the relations between <b>volume</b> ratio, <b>suction</b> closure <b>volume,</b> discharge opening volume and slide valves displacement. An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) thermodynamic model with SSE integrated with slide valves is developed to analyze the power output of SSE and the net power output of ORC system and variation law of slide valves displacement. Analysis of a typical ORC system under changing operating conditions shows that the power output of the expander and the net output power of the ORC system with slide valves are much better than those without slide valves. When the condensing temperature is 40 °C and the waste availability is 80 kW, the increase in output power and net output power are approximately 3. 4 kW and 5 kW, respectively.

In all, 32 patients (51 %) later developed seromas requiring needle aspiration. Minor wound infection rate was not significantly higher in patients who developed seromas {{than those who did not}} (5 vs 2).

40|$|This master thesis {{considers}} three subtasks {{related to}} transient operation of wet gas compressors. HYSYS Dynamics {{is used to}} establish a dynamic simulation model in the first subtask. The model is designed to predict transient behavior of the compressor test facility at NTNU during dry and wet gas trip scenarios. Its steady state performance has been validated against test data. The deviation of polytropic head and <b>suction</b> <b>volume</b> flow is less than 1 % for all test points but one. Dry and wet gas model performance during trip is validated in the second subtask. The deviation is evaluated in terms of rotational speed, polytropic head and <b>suction</b> <b>volume</b> flow. Minimal deviation is observed for rotational speed. The polytropic head prediction deviates up to 7. 21 % compared to values calculated from test data. The deviation {{is partly due to}} consistent offset between the predicted and calculated curves. Curve fitting is expected to significantly reduce the polytropic head deviation. The predicted <b>suction</b> <b>volume</b> flow deviates severely from the values based on test data. This is also evident during the first seconds of trip, which is unfortunate in terms of surge behavior prediction. The maximum deviation is 8. 68 %The last subtask considers deviation between dry and wet compressor behavior during a representative transient operating scenario. It was decided to investigate compressor response during speed ramp-up from 9 000 rpm to 11 000 rpm for dry and wet gas. The scenarios are also performed in the lab facility. The simulations suggest a slower increase in rotational speed for wet gas compared to dry gas. This is not confirmed by test results which indicate no difference between wet and dry gas.

40|$|International audienceSeahorses {{give birth}} to juveniles having a fully {{functional}} feeding apparatus, and juvenile feeding behaviour shows striking similarities to that of adults. However, a significant allometric growth of the snout is observed during which the snout shape changes from relatively short and broad in juveniles to relatively long and slender in adults. Since {{the shape of the}} buccal cavity is a critical determinant of suction performance, this snout allometry will inevitably affect the suction feeding ability. To test whether the snout is optimised for suction feeding throughout ontogeny, we simulated the expansion of different snout shapes varying from extremely long and slender to short and broad for juvenile and adult snout sizes using computational fluid dynamic models. Our results showed that the snout diameter {{at the start of the}} simulations is involved in a trade-off between the realisable <b>suction</b> <b>volume</b> and expansion time on the one hand (improving with larger initial diameters), and maximal flow velocity on the other hand (improving with smaller initial diameters). Moreover, suction performance (<b>suction</b> <b>volume</b> as well as maximal attainable flow velocity) increased with decreasing snout length. However, an increase in snout length decreases the time to reach the prey by cranial rotation, which may explain the prevalence of long snouts among syngnathid fishes despite the reduced suction performance. Thus the design of the seahorse snout revolves around a trade-off between the ability to generate high-volume suction versus minimisation of the time needed to reach the prey by cranial rotation...|$|E
40|$|Suction feeding is {{the most}} common {{vertebrate}} feeding mode. Fishes suction feed by rapidly expanding the buccal cavity, creating a subambient pressure inside the mouth that causes water (and, ideally, a prey item) to rush in. The predator’s ability to close the mouth around evasive prey determines feeding success. As a fish grows, the volume it engulfs should scale with length to the third power (volume ∝ length 3). This becomes a burden on larger fishes, as muscle force (which drives mouth closing) should scale with length squared (force ∝ muscle cross-sectional area ∝ length 2). Since <b>suction</b> <b>volume</b> increases faster with size than muscle force, a force deficit results as fish grow larger. Two ways to counteract this deficit are to increase muscle mass or increase skeletal leverage within the jaw. In this study, we examined musculoskeletal variation in anatomy and kinematics across an ontogenetic series in the suction-feeding great sculpin, Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus. Our results show that great sculpin mandibles change shape as they grow, increasing jaw-closing muscle leverage, which counters the force deficit (N = 6, p = 0. 0456). Kinematic results agree: a given amount of muscle strain produces less jaw displacement in larger fish (N = 6, p > 0. 00015). We did not find disproportionate changes in muscle mass with size (N = 7, p=. 514). Smaller fish, therefore, rely on high-velocity jaw closing whereas larger fish rely more on high forces to close the jaw. We hypothesize that a smaller fish needs high speed {{to reduce the risk of}} prey escape from a small <b>suction</b> <b>volume,</b> whereas a large fish needs high forces to move the disproportionately large volume of water...|$|E

40|$|During {{mechanical}} ventilation, {{patients are}} connected to the ventilator by an endotracheal tube. The tube needs to be cleaned from mucus by suction, which can cause negative effects such as lung collapse, hypoxemia and desaturation. These can be avoided by preoxygenation, change of ventilator settings, use of closed suction systems and recruitment manoeuvres. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the effects of endotracheal suction during different ventilator settings and by different suction methods. A method to reverse side effects was investigated. In anaesthetized pigs, the effect of <b>suction</b> during <b>volume</b> and pressure-controlled ventilation was investigated, and the effect of different suction systems and catheter sizes were compared. Suction efficacy was investigated in a bench study. The effect of recruitment manoeuvre added after suction, i. e. post-suction recruitment manoeuvre was evaluated. Endotracheal <b>suction</b> causes lung <b>volume</b> loss leading to impaired gas exchange, an effect that is more severe in pressure-controlled ventilation than in volume-controlled ventilation. When 14 French suction catheters were used more side effects were found compared to 12 French catheters, but no difference was found between open and closed suction system in pressure-controlled ventilation. Open suction system was more effective to remove mucus compared to closed system. Post-suction recruitment manoeuvre restored the side effects after the first recruitment when it was applied directly after suction. In conclusion, open endotracheal suction causes impairment in gas exchange and lung mechanics, and more so in pressure-controlled than in volume-controlled mode. These changes can be minimized if smaller suction catheters are used. A post-suction recruitment manoeuvre applied directly after suction restores lung function. It is obvious that the recruitment manoeuvre should be added directly after suction, because if the manoeuvre is delayed and the lung is collapsed and left collapsed, it will be more difficult to recruit the lung...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to derive the soil water retention from the soil structure without curve-fitting and only using the physical parameters found irrespective of an experimental retention curve. Two key points underlie the work: (i) the soil suction at drying coincides {{with that of the}} soil intra-aggregate matrix and contributive clay; and (ii) both the soil <b>suction</b> and <b>volume</b> shrinkage at drying depend on the same soil water content. In addition the two following results are used: (i) the available two-factor (capillarity and shrinkage) model of clay suction enables one to connect a clay suction and clay water content using the clay matrix structure; and (ii) the recent reference shrinkage curve model based on the concepts of intra-aggregate soil structure permits one to connect the soil water content at shrinkage with the water content of the contributive clay. With that the available two-factor model was essentially modified and, in particular, the effect of adsorbed water film was taken into account. The developed model includes the following input parameters: the solid density, relative volume of contributive-clay solids, relative volume of contributive clay in the oven-dried state, soil clay content, aggregate/intra-aggregate mass ratio, and specific volume of lacunar pores in the aggregates at maximum swelling.

The treatments consisted of 0, 7, and 28 Mg ha- 1 of agricultural gypsum rates distributed on the soil surface of the coffee rows, between which Brachiaria was grown and periodically cut, and compared with a treatment without Brachiaria between coffee rows and no gypsum application. To determine the aggregation state using the HEMC method, soil aggregates were placed in a Büchner funnel (500 mL) and wetted using a peristaltic pump with a volumetric syringe. The wetting was applied increasingly at two pre-set speeds: slow (2 mm h- 1) and fast (100 mm h- 1).

In this study, we examined muscle force and muscle strain variation across sizes in the suction- feeding great sculpin, Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus. Because muscles are subject to the limitations of the length-tension relationship, we saw maximum force (P 0) production at intermediate muscle lengths (L 0) and declining forces at longer/shorter muscle lengths. Our results show that great sculpin maintain a constant amount of muscle strain to achieve at least 50 % of their maximum force (P 0) throughout ontogeny. As the great sculpin grows, it uses a wider range of this available muscle strain in feeding, stretching its muscles away from L 0 and losing force in the process. Thus in addition to an increasing muscle force deficit, larger great sculpin experience declining jaw-closing forces due to the length-tension properties of jaw- closing muscles...|$|E
40|$|LectureLecture 4 : The {{gas flow}} {{entering}} {{from the inlet}} flange of a centrifugal compressor may induce radial forces on the rotor, by directly impinging onto shaft or by generating asymmetric pressure fluctuations in the gas volume surrounding the shaft. This aerodynamic excitation represents a potential source of radial vibrations for the rotor; it {{is characterized by a}} broad-band, low frequency spectrum and its effects are typically observed to increase when the operating point moves towards the top right part of the operating envelope, i. e. at high operating speed and high inlet flowrate. The severity of the vibrations caused by this airborne excitation depends on the thermodynamic parameters of the inlet gas (flowrate, velocity, density) and on the mechanical design of the compressor (geometry of the <b>suction</b> <b>volume,</b> stiffness of rotor and journal bearings). While the former are generally constrained by process requirements, the latter can be optimized in order to minimize the induced vibrations. Moreover, a very effective way to mitigate this phenomenon is the adoption of Inlet Guide Vanes at compressor suction that can protect the shaft from exciting forces; on the other hand the installation of IGVs increases the cost and the mechanical complexity of the design, and may also have a non-negligible impact on performances, causing a pressure loss. For this reason it is useful to define a screening criterion to decide whether to install IGVs, based on the predicted sensitivity of the rotor to inlet gas flow excitation. Such criterion was developed basing on physical considerations and then validated through application to a set of recorded references from compressors tested in full load. The outcome allowed to build a diagram based on compressor geometry and operating data, where a boundary line separates the safe area (no significant vibration expected) from the area where the application of IGVs is suggested...|$|E

The increase of the number of teeth of the inner gear is beneficial; both for the reduction of the flow ripple and for the increase of the displacement at equal overall pump size...|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that the power {{consumption}} of an unbaffled stirred vessel decreases significantly when the regular blades are replaced by fractal ones. In this paper, the physical explanation for this reduction is investigated using Direct Numerical Simulations at Re= 1600. The gaps around the fractal blade perimeter create jets that penetrate inside the recirculation zone in the wake and break up the trailing vortices into smaller ones. This affects the time-average recirculation pattern on the <b>suction</b> side. The <b>volume</b> of the separation region is 7 % smaller in the wake of the fractal blades. The lower torque of the fractal impeller is equivalent to a decreased transport of angular momentum; this difference stems from the reduced turbulent transport induced by the smaller trailing vortices. The major difference in the turbulent dissipation is seen in the vicinity of trailing vortices, due to fluctuations of velocity gradients at relatively low frequencies.

40|$|Granular soil {{is used as}} a {{backfilling}} {{material in}} trenches that are prepared for the installation, repair and replacement of service pipes. The soil is likely to be partially saturated and subjected to low stress levels (< 100 kPa), as it exists at shallow depths (about 5 m below the ground) A new double-wall triaxial cell has been designed for testing partially saturated granular specimens with height/diameter equalt o 375 mm/ 150 m m, at low stress levels. The cell is able to make separate measurements and control of the pore air and pore water pressures. It was designed to make specimens tress and strain measurements in ternally. A conventional triaxial cell was modified to carry out tests on saturated granular specimens of the same dimensions at low stress levels. Two gradings of Limestone, fine and coarse, with maximum particle sizes of 5 nun and 20 mm respectively ere used in the triaxial tests. The experimental results showed that the suction in the range 25 kPa to 75 kPa can {{have an effect on the}} volume, stiffness and shear strength of partially saturated granular soils at low stress levels. Ile results also showed that there is a linear relationship between q and (p-u.) for the unsaturated soils or (p-u,,) for the saturated soils. And Fredlund's equation cannot be used to predict the shear strength of partially saturated granular soils at low stress levels, if the value of O'is taken from tests carried out on saturated specimens. The results also showed that there was a relationship between q, (p-q.), <b>suction,</b> specific <b>volume</b> and water content, all at failure...|$|R
