40|$|Increasing {{security}} in transports without negatively affecting the logistical flow makes efficiency a critical factor. To achieve a viable end-to-end security solution in a supply chain, with complex network of dependencies, requires a holistic perspective. The pilot project {{was driven by}} Volvo Technology and it involved important stakeholders in the supply chain and port domain focusing on the Port of Gothenburg. The project results show increased security and efficiency through for example faster passages {{in and out of}} ports as well as electronic handling of documents. This leads to the possibility of focusing on value adding activities like transportation of goods, as intended, instead of waiting time in ports. The world’s <b>seaborne</b> container <b>traffic</b> carries approximately 80 % of the world trade but its current security level does not reflect its importance for society. Millions of containers flow through ports and only a fraction of them are ever scrutinized. Security threats towards critical societal infrastructures, e. g. international ports, have resulted in several security and supply chain initiatives. So far, these initiatives mainly focus on nodes like ports and terminals. Nevertheless, in order to secure the entire supply chain and attain end-to-end security, the security of goods while in-transit needs to be ensured as well, achieving secure links. At the same time, several ports suffer from congestion and are in urgent need of procedures and technologies to increase the through-put speed of goods...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{biosecurity}} {{is necessary}} to protect nations and their citizens {{from a variety of}} threats, including emerging infectious diseases, agricultural or environmental pests and pathogens, and illegal wildlife trade. The physical pathways by which these threats are transported internationally, predominantly shipping and air traffic, have undergone significant growth and changes in spatial distributions in recent decades. An understanding of the specific pathways and donor-traffic hotspots created by this integrated physical transport network is vital for the development of effective biosecurity strategies into the future. In this study, we analysed the physical transport network into Australia over the period 1999 - 2012. <b>Seaborne</b> and air <b>traffic</b> were weighted to calculate a "weighted cumulative impact" score for each source region worldwide, each year. High risk source regions, and those source regions that underwent substantial changes in risk over the study period, were determined. An overall risk ranking was calculated by integrating across all possible weighting combinations. The source regions having greatest overall physical connectedness with Australia were Singapore, which is a global transport hub, and the North Island of New Zealand, a close regional trading partner with Australia. Both those regions with large amounts of traffic across multiple vectors (e. g., Hong Kong), and those with high levels of traffic of only one type (e. g., Bali, Indonesia with respect to passenger flights), were represented among high risk source regions. These data provide a baseline model for the transport of individuals and commodities against which the effectiveness of biosecurity controls may be assessed, and are a valuable tool in the development of future biosecurity policy.

40|$|The twin-city {{model has}} found to {{increase}} economical activity and well-being. The similar economical, {{social and cultural}} background of Finland and Estonia {{as well as the}} EU integration give good preconditions to create a twin-city of Helsinki and Tallinn. The relatively long distance between Helsinki and Tallinn is challenging. Therefore, good transport infrastructure and functioning connections are required to form a twin-city of Helsinki and Tallinn. The connections between these cities can be considered also in broader perspective than only from the viewpoint of the twin-city concept. New markets areas have been emerged in Europe due to collapse of planned economy and integration of Europe. Also the transport routes to the markets are changing. The Hel-sinki-Tallinn sea route can be considered as a fast route to the new markets in the Cen-tral and Eastern Europe. The Helsinki-Tallinn sea route is also a potential route to the Western European markets. This study provides an analysis of transport and cargo flows between Finland and Esto-nia for regional and local planners. The main purpose of the study is to clarify the pre-sent situation of the seaborne cargo flows on the Helsinki-Tallinn route and how the cargo flows will develop in the future. The study focuses on the following thematic enti-ties: the Finnish and Estonian seaborne transport system and cargo flows, the structure and volume of the cargo flows on the Helsinki-Tallinn route, the hinterland cargo flows on the Helsinki-Tallinn route and the transport methods used on the Helsinki-Tallinn route. The study was carried out as a desk research, a statistical analysis and an inter-view study during the spring–autumn 2011. The study reveals that during the period 2002 – 2010 the volume of the <b>seaborne</b> cargo <b>traffic</b> between Finland and Estonia has increased significantly while the trend of the trade volume between Finland and Estonia has remained nearly constant. This indicates that the route via Estonia is increasingly used in the Finnish foreign trade. Because the ports of Helsinki and Tallinn are the main ports in the cargo traffic between Finland and Estonia, the role of the Helsinki-Tallinn route as a sea leg in the hinterland connections of Finland has increased. The growth of the cargo volume on the Helsinki-Tallinn route was estimated to continue on the annual level of 10 % during the next couple of years. In the long run the growth of the cargo volumes depends on the economical and indus-trial development of the former Eastern European countries. If the IMO’s sulphur regu-lations will come in force, the Helsinki-Tallinn route will become one of the main routes also to the Western European markets, besides of the route via Sweden. The study also shows that the fast and reliable connections year round on the Helsinki-Tallinn route have made it possible for service and logistics companies to reconsider their logistics strategies in a new way in the both side of the Gulf of Finland. Anyway, the ropax concept is seen as the only economical profitable solution on the Helsinki-Tallinn route because cargo and passenger traffic are supporting each other. The trucks (vehicle combinations) will remain the main mode of transport on the Helsinki-Tallinn route because general cargo is the main commodity on the route.

The volume of goods carried by rail declined significantly in the post-war period due to agricultural and industrial depression, coupled with the growth of road competition to which the line was vulnerable due to the short distances over which traffic was conveyed.

40|$|One of {{the great}} themes {{in the history of}} sea {{transportation}} is the survival of the victims of shipwrecks. Disaster at sea and the sufferings of the survivors has exerted a continuing fascination because of the catastrophic nature of the occurrence. In the great age of sail and steam the volume of <b>seaborne</b> <b>traffic</b> and the extent of settlement meant that shipwreck survivors had a reasonable chance of rescue, but those who were isolated by geography or communications could be forced to fend for themselves for long periods of time. If these groups reached land they would have to cope with the problems of subsistence, isolation, difficult group dynamics, and a possibly hostile terrain. Commonly they carried out actions such as salvaging cargo and equipment, establishing a social or command structure, adapting to the local environment, and developing rescue strategies. The setting up of a camp or base of operations is also a central theme in shipwreck survivor accounts. Given that there is a large body of information on shipwreck survivors there has been remarkably little consideration of the subject as a field of documentary or archaeological study. Martin Gibbs has provided the only substantive overview of the subject of shipwreck survivor camps in a recently published paper (2003), and considers that ‘shipwreck survivor camps are a neglected terrestrial component of maritime archaeology, usually being investigated purely as an adjunct to work on the associated wreck site ’ (Gibbs, 2003 : 128). In the same paper Gibbs puts forward a comparative framework for the study of shipwreck survivor camps as a class of archaeological site. This model highlights a number of elements or themes that are common to the development of shipwreck survivor camps and how these might be reflected in the archaeological record.

This update paper 1 provides an extensive overview of the economic importance and development of the Flemish maritime ports, the Li 8 ge port complex and the port of Brussels in the period 2001 - 2006, with an emphasis on 2006. The port of Brussels has been included in the analysis for the first time. Focusing on the three major variables of value added, employment and investment, the report also provides some information about the financial situation in each port except for Brussels. These observations are linked to a more general context, along with a few cargo statistics. Annual accounts data from the Central Balance Sheet Office were used for the calculation of direct effects, the study of financial ratios and the analysis of the social balance sheet. The indirect effects of the activities concerned were estimated in terms of value added and employment, on the basis of data from the National Accounts Institute. In terms of quantity of cargo handled, 2006 was an excellent year for the Flemish maritime ports as a whole, driven by the world trade expansion. Direct value added rose in all Flemish port, except for Antwerp. Direct employment also increased, mainly in the maritime branches as a result of <b>seaborne</b> <b>traffic</b> growth. Investment on the other hand, took a downward plunge after the exceptionally high amounts in 2005. This was mainly due to a number of shipping companies and - to a lesser extent - the completion of the Deurganckdok in Antwerp. The current changes in world trade patterns have a substantial impact on the activities in the Flemish ports. To cope with the accelerating internationalisation of port competition and the tremendous growth of containerised seaborne transport, the ports need to constantly adapt their infrastructures, through innovation and investment. As major logistic centres, they have to face the challenge of responding to increasing demand in terms of capacity, while adding as much value as possible to the goods passing through them. To face this challenge, they try to focus on particular branches or aspects for which they believe they hold all the winning cards. This has become absolutely vital in a climate of growing regional and international competition, accentuated by the booming Asian economies. All figures indicate that the situation is improving for the port of Li 8 ge. The growth of value added, investment and quantity of cargo handled exceeds last year's figures. Employment still decreases but to a lesser extent.
