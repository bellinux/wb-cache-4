In the vertical layout of <b>scaffold</b> <b>board,</b> this scheme alternately arranged to take the "two layers of bamboo fence one layer steel fence". In order to verify the feasibility of the prevention of the spread of fire about the new scaffold construction scheme, three groups of fire experiments were designed. By the analysis of experimental phenomena and data results, it is concluded that the steel fence boards used as isolation layers in the new scaffold construction scheme can effectively mitigate the risk of fire spreading upward or downward along the burning scaffold...|$|E
40|$|Timber <b>scaffold</b> <b>boards</b> {{have been}} widely {{utilised}} in the offshore construction industry. However, technical specifications and inspection procedure {{for the application of}} <b>scaffold</b> <b>boards</b> from a wood material were inadequate. In the development of the standard requirements, evaluation of actual engineering practices could indicate the level of workplace safety. A study was conducted to identify risk and safety measures concerning the use of timber <b>scaffold</b> <b>boards</b> in construction. This article discusses on the occupational risks and ergonomics issues of the scaffolding application based on the physical and mechanical conditions of tropical timber <b>scaffold</b> <b>boards</b> extracted from offshore oil and gas rigs. The boards were exposed to a seasonal climate of East Coast monsoon of South China Sea between November and February. The scaffolding application extended up to 20 m directly above the ocean surface and some boards were completely immersed below the ocean surface particularly during elevated tidal waves. Some of the boards were installed as the on-deck platforms. Forty <b>scaffold</b> <b>boards</b> fabricated from tropical timber species were evaluated. Physical characteristics of the boards were described by natural and man-made factors. A three-point bending test was conducted to determine the maximum load capacity of each board and the mode of fracture was evaluated. Timber identification test was conducted to identify the groups of the timber being used. The microscopic observation confirmed the presence of hyphae which indicated the biological deterioration has happened in some of the boards. Occupational risks were summarised {{based on the results of}} the physical and mechanical assessments...|$|R

"I {{stayed at}} Meran two years, till I'd learnt all I could there, then a brother of my mother's {{helped me to}} get to Vienna; I {{was lucky enough to}} find work with a man who used to {{decorate}} churches. We went about the country together. Once when he was ill I painted the roof of a church entirely by myself; I lay on my back on the <b>scaffold</b> <b>boards</b> all day for a week--I was proud of that roof." [...] He paused.|$|R
40|$|A {{study is}} described, {{carried out on}} {{specially}} prepared specimens, that specifically examines the effect of slope of grain on the bending strength of <b>scaffold</b> <b>boards.</b> Each specimen was visually graded and both the modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity in bending determined. From the effect of slope of grain on the reduction of bending strength revised visual grading rules have been suggested that include a slope of grain limit of 1 in 12. It has also been demonstrated that machine grading is as effective at determining the adverse effect of slope of grain on board strength {{as it is for}} other defects such as high rate of growth and knots...|$|R
50|$|Boards {{provide a}} working surface for {{scaffold}} users. They are seasoned wood {{and come in}} three thicknesses (38 mm (usual), 50 mm and 63 mm) are a standard width (225 mm) and are a maximum of 3.9 m long. The board ends are protected either by metal plates called hoop irons or sometimes nail plates, which often have the company name stamped into them. Timber <b>scaffold</b> <b>boards</b> in the UK should {{comply with the requirements}} of BS 2482. As well as timber, steel or aluminium decking is used, as well as laminate boards. In addition to the boards for the working platform, there are sole boards which are placed beneath the scaffolding if the surface is soft or otherwise suspect, although ordinary boards can also be used. Another solution, called a scaffpad, is made from a rubber base with a base plate moulded inside; these are desirable for use on uneven ground since they adapt, whereas sole boards may split and have to be replaced.|$|R
50|$|The core {{component}} of FLE3, the <b>scaffolded</b> knowledge-building discussion <b>board,</b> was re-created {{as a simple}} plugin in WordPress, the ubiquitous open source web server system. FLE4 {{was not intended to}} be a new system, but instead a re-implementation of the most important element of the previous system in a very user-friendly technology. Two sets of scaffolds are available in FLE4: Knowledge Building with its 5 knowledge types and de Bono's Six Hat Thinking with its 6 knowledge types.|$|R
50|$|Crossroads Tavern, {{also known}} as Crossroads Inn, is a {{historic}} inn and tavern located at North Garden, Albemarle County, Virginia. It was built about 1820. In the mid nineteenth century, Clifton G. Sutherland, son of Joseph Sutherland, owned and ran the tavern which was located on the Staunton and James River Turnpike. It served as a tavern and overnight lodging for farmers and travelers using the turnpike. In 1889, Daniel B. Landes bought the land at the public auction of the estate of Clifton Sutherland. The property continued to be conveyed to various owners over the years. The Crossroads Tavern is an early nineteenth century two- to three-story, three bay, double pile brick structure. The building sits {{on top of a}} brick and stone foundation, is roofed with tin and has pairs of interior brick chimneys on either gable end. The brick is laid in five course American bond with Flemish variant. Windows on the basement level {{at the rear of the}} house (north side) are barred; other basement windows are nine-over-six sash. Put-holes are found at the west end of the building, formerly providing sockets for <b>scaffold</b> <b>boards</b> should repairs be necessary. The front facade is dominated by a porch on the second story extending the entire width of the south and east facades. It is supported by five rounded brick columns and the tin roof above is supported by simple square wooden pillars connected by horizontal rails. Doors of the front of the basement level open respectively into kitchen and dining room and into a spirits cellar with its original barrel racks as well as a laundry fireplace. Floors on this level were originally dirt but dining room and kitchen floors have been cemented. The main entrance door on the second level, with its multi-panes lights, opens onto a central stair hall with tow main rooms on either side. This stair hall has an ascending stair at its front and both ascending and descending stairs toward its center. Formerly the ascending stairs led to upstairs areas which did not connect. There is no ridge pole in the three attic rooms. The interiors of windows and doors on the main entrance side have extremely long wooden lintels. With few exceptions, the interior woodwork is original, including floors, chair rails, mantels and built in cupboards. Also on the property is a two story contributing summer kitchen, brick up to the second story and frame above, and with an exterior brick chimney at the rear gable with fireplaces on both floors. It is operated as a bed and breakfast.|$|R
