5|$|Despite its later {{importance}} to Britain, Gibraltar was initially {{seen by the}} British Government {{as more of a}} bargaining counter than a <b>strategic</b> <b>asset.</b> Its defences continued to be neglected, its garrisoning was an unwelcome expense, and Spanish pressure threatened Britain's vital overseas trade.

40|$|Drawing on {{multiple}} cases of cross-border merger and acquisitions (CBMAs) by Chinese multinational enterprises (CMNEs), we investigate their search of <b>strategic</b> <b>assets</b> in developed economies (DEs). It is a received view that CMNEs use CBMAs to access <b>strategic</b> <b>assets</b> in DEs {{so as to}} address their latecomer disadvantages and competitive weakness. This paper aims to identify the nature of <b>strategic</b> <b>assets</b> that sought after by CMNEs and the post-CBMA integration approach, a partnering approach, adopted in enabling access to these assets. The findings reveal that CMNEs possess firm-specific assets that give them competitive advantages at home and seek for complementary <b>strategic</b> <b>assets</b> in the similar domain, but at a more advanced level. The partnering approach helps securing these <b>strategic</b> <b>assets</b> through no or limited integration, giving autonomy to target firm management team, retaining talents and creating synergy...|$|R

5|$|The next day, American forces {{advanced}} to Kirkuk during Operation Option North, hoping to control oil fields and military airfields {{in and around}} the city. Controlling the oil fields had been a specific operational goal of the Task Force because they were viewed as the most valuable <b>strategic</b> <b>asset</b> in northern Iraq. Between 30 March and 2 April, the 173d Airborne Brigade, along with the Special Forces detachment and the Kurdish forces, engaged and destroyed the 2nd, 4th, 8th and 38th Iraqi Infantry divisions as well as a force loyal to Ansar al-Islam. The brigade used field artillery assets, as well as coordinated airstrikes to attack Iraqi Republican Guard units defending the city. Within a week these units began to fall apart due to desertions. On 10 April the brigade was able to move into the city, securing it after a short urban battle. The entire battle for Kirkuk cost the brigade only nine casualties. During the operation, some of the troops discovered at least two caches of Iraqi gold, totaling more than 2,000 bars. The unit then took part in Operation Peninsula Strike, quelling Ba'ath party resistance and other insurgent groups. These operations, though successful, would have been more effective if the 4th Infantry Division's four heavy brigades were able to enter Iraq through Turkey as originally planned. 4th ID had to relocate their forces from Turkey to Kuwait and were subsequently slowed down in Baghdad. VCorps was not able to surround Baghdad as quickly as it had hoped {{because of a lack of}} available forces in the north. The resulting wear and tear of 4th ID's M1 Abrams and M2 Bradleys made them an ineffective unit in tight urban areas such as Jar Salah. Because their heavily armored tanks required so much maintenance, the 173d incorporated much of 4th ID's area of operation into their own. The 173d secured these areas with company sized detachments, often patrolling the 4th ID's sectors with two unarmored M998 cargo Humvees at any given time.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the railway}} saw an {{increase}} in traffic during the First World War, it was extensive military-related construction in the late 1930s and early 1940s which proved the worth of the Newfoundland Railway as a <b>strategic</b> <b>asset.</b> An air force base was developed adjacent to the main line in Gander, and major American military bases were constructed in Stephenville (Ernest Harmon AFB), Argentia (NS Argentia) and St. John's (Pepperrell AFB), in addition to Canadian and British defence facilities in St. John's. Given the lack of roads and all-weather highways in Newfoundland during the 1940s, and the U-boat threat in the waters off-shore, the Newfoundland Railway became a vital, yet very obscure, supply link in the defence of the North Atlantic and the allied convoy system.|$|E

40|$|More Chinese {{companies}} are using cross-border merger and acquisition (M&A) to access and source <b>strategic</b> <b>assets</b> {{so as to}} address their competitive disadvantage. However, there is lack {{of research on the}} rationale for such strategic-asset-seeking M&A. This paper intends to address this critical issue from an institutional perspective. Building on institutional theory, we propose a model of resource-driven motivation behind Chinese M&A. To shed light on the explanatory power of this institutional framework, we draw on a multiple-case study of three leading Chinese firms [...] TCL, BOE and Lenovo. By arguing that cross-border M&A from Chinese firms represents a means to acquire <b>strategic</b> <b>assets</b> is the logic of Chinese unique institutional environment, this study is of importance not only to stimulate possible theoretical extensions but also to draw implications to other emerging market firms. <b>Strategic</b> <b>assets</b> Cross-border M&A Institutional theory Chinese companies...|$|R
40|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{existing}} literature emphasized that China's companies sought <b>strategic</b> <b>assets</b> (technology, brands and access to markets) through internationalization in order to overcome latecomers' comparative disadvantage, while some studies suggested that these firms went after natural resources to address China's rising oil imports. The third argument (which we coin the ‘sectoral strength’ hypothesis) suggested that the upstream firms in extractive business would seek natural resources, whereas downstream ones would seek <b>strategic</b> <b>assets.</b> In this study, we examine the rationale of main overseas investment deals (‘going out’) of China's two largest national oil companies during 2002 – 2010 which were also China's top two non-financial firms with the largest outward investment stocks during 2004 – 2010. We conclude that these deals can be best explained by the ‘sectoral specialisation’ hypothesis supplemented with a consideration for <b>strategic</b> <b>assets...</b>|$|R

This land barrier protected Bruges from bombardment by land or sea by all but the very largest calibre artillery and also secured it against raiding parties from the Royal Navy. Capitalising on the natural advantages of the port, the German Navy constructed extensive training and repair facilities at Bruges, equipped to provide support for several flotillas of destroyers, torpedo boats and U-boats.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a series}} of defeats by Wei Qing (the {{half-brother}} of Emperor Wu's favorite concubine) and Wei's nephew, Huo Qubing between 127 and 119 BC, the Xiongnu were expelled from the Ordos Desert and Qilian Mountains. [...] As {{a result of these}} territorial acquisitions, the Han Dynasty successfully opened up the Northern Silk Road, allowing direct access to trade with Central Asia.

[...] In discussing their report, Walter B.

[...] Robert D. Blackwill countered {{the claim that the}} U.S.-Israel relationship significantly damages the relationship between the United States and the Arab world. [...] He asked rhetorically: [...] "Would Saudi Arabia's policies toward the United States be markedly different in practice if Washington entered into a sustained crisis with Israel over the Palestine issue during which the bilateral relationship between the United States and Israel went into steep, systemic decline? In that instance, would Riyadh lower the price of oil? Would it stop hedging its regional bets concerning U.S. attempts to coerce Iran into freezing its nuclear weapons program? Would it regard U.S. policy toward Afghanistan any less critically? Would it view American democracy promotion in the Middle East more favorably? Would it be more inclined to reform its internal governmental processes to be more in line with U.S. preferences? Walt [...] and I judge the answer to all these questions [...] 'No.'" [...] When asked how this report could so flatly contradict the Walt and Mearsheimer thesis, Slocombe responded, [...] "There is so much error in the world," [...] and added, [...] "I think {{it would be interesting to}} ask them whether they make the same contrary argument about the other countries to whom we also provide something like this kind of support.
