Up to one million Ndebele may have left the country {{over the last five}} years, mainly for South Africa. Other Bantu ethnic groups make up the third largest with 2 to 5%: these are Venda, Tonga, Shangaan, Kalanga, <b>Sotho,</b> Ndau, Nambya, Tswana, Xhosa and Lozi.|$|E
5|$|When Makeba was {{eighteen}} days old, {{her mother was}} arrested and sentenced to a six-month prison term for selling umqombothi, a homemade beer brewed from malt and cornmeal. The family could not afford the small fine required to avoid a jail term, and Miriam spent {{the first six months}} of her life in jail. As a child, Makeba sang in the choir of the Kilnerton Training Institute in Pretoria, an all-black Methodist primary school that she attended for eight years. Her talent for singing earned her praise at school. Makeba was baptised a Protestant, and sang in church choirs, in English, Xhosa, <b>Sotho,</b> and Zulu; she later said that she learned to sing in English before she could speak the language.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch East India Company {{had founded}} the Cape Colony on the {{southern}} tip of Africa in 1652 as a way station for its ships travelling to and from its colonies in the East Indies. Britain formally acquired the colony, and its large Afrikaner (or Boer) population in 1806, having occupied it in 1795 to prevent its falling into French hands during the Flanders Campaign. British immigration began to rise after 1820, and pushed thousands of Boers, resentful of British rule, northwards to found their own—mostly short-lived—independent republics, during the Great Trek of the late 1830s and early 1840s. In the process the Voortrekkers clashed repeatedly with the British, who had their own agenda with regard to colonial expansion in South Africa and to the various native African polities, including those of the <b>Sotho</b> and the Zulu nations. Eventually the Boers established two republics which had a longer lifespan: the South African Republic or Transvaal Republic (1852–77; 1881–1902) and the Orange Free State (1854–1902). In 1902 Britain occupied both republics, concluding a treaty with the two Boer Republics following the Second Boer War (1899–1902).|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} states {{to emerge from the}} Mfecane was the <b>Sotho</b> Kingdom founded at Thaba Bosiu by Moshoeshoe I around 1821 to 1822. It was a {{confederation}} of different polities that accepted the absolute authority of Moshoeshoe. During the 1830s, the kingdom invited missionaries as a strategic means of acquiring guns and horses from the Cape. The Orange Free State slowly diminished the kingdom but never completely defeated it. In 1868, Moshoeshoe asked that the <b>Sotho</b> Kingdom be annexed by Britain, to save the remnant. It became the British protectorate of Basutoland.|$|E
25|$|The word is {{pronounced}} tseh-tseh in the <b>Sotho</b> languages and is easily rendered in other African languages. During World War II, a de Havilland antisubmarine aircraft {{was known as}} the 'Tsetse' Mosquito.|$|E
25|$|Battles against English and Boer forces. The Basotho {{clashed with}} several enemies to {{maintain}} their fragile independence. In the 1840s they fought against the Tlokwa, who were also mounted, and against the Zulu-influenced Nedebele, who were primarily infantry. In 1851, a British colonial force invaded <b>Sotho</b> country and was soundly defeated {{at the battle of}} Kononyaba (or Viervoet). Against the British, who deployed an artillery piece, the spear and battle-axe proved more useful than guns when the <b>Sotho</b> hemmed in the invaders on a mountaintop. Victory was gained by close hand-to-hand fighting. This incident provided a significant check to British power in the area. The following year another British force tried its luck, and was also defeated. This encounter saw the widespread deployment of <b>Sotho</b> cavalry. At one point in the battle, some 6,000 Basotho horsemen mounted a charge against the British formation. They were repulsed by rifle and artillery fire. Nevertheless, the tribal regiments controlled the field {{at the end of the}} day, and the British withdrew.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Sotho</b> {{musician}} Tshwatlano Makala was {{the first}} traditional musician to achieve widespread commercial success. He helped {{to set the stage}} for the subsequent rise of Letsema Mat'sela's band, Basotho Dihoba, which used styles from his native Lesotho to develop a genre called mohobelo.|$|E
25|$|The {{racial groups}} of the {{population}} were 84.9% Black African, 10.8% White, 3.7% Coloured, 0.4% Indian or Asian and 0.2% other. Of those asked about their first language, 58.3% spoke <b>Sotho,</b> 14.6% spoke Afrikaans, 13.6% spoke Xhosa, 5.0% spoke English, 2.2% spoke Zulu, 1.9% spoke Tswana and 1.2% spoke Tsonga.|$|E
25|$|When most South Africans and {{visitors}} {{speak of the}} Drakensberg, they refer to the Great Escarpment that forms the border between Lesotho and KwaZulu-Natal, believing {{it to be a}} range of mountains extending into Lesotho, more correctly known as the Lesotho Highlands. This highest portion of the Great Escarpment is known as uKhahlamba ("Barrier of up-pointed spears") in Zulu and Maluti in <b>Sotho.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the migrant}} groups, ancestral to today's Nguni peoples (the Zulu, Xhosa, Swazi, and Ndebele), {{preferred}} {{to live near}} the eastern coast of what is present-day South Africa. Others, {{now known as the}} Sotho–Tswana peoples (Tswana, Pedi, and <b>Sotho),</b> settled in the interior on the plateau known as the Highveld, while today's Venda, Lemba, and Shangaan-Tsonga peoples made their homes in the north-eastern areas of present-day South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Southeast of the Drakensberg {{mountains}} lived Nguni-speaking peoples (Zulu, Xhosa, Swazi, and Ndebele). They too {{engaged in}} state building, with new states developing from rivalry, disagreements, and population pressure causing movement into new regions. This 19th-century process of warfare, state building and migration later {{became known as}} the Mfecane (Nguni) or Difaqane (<b>Sotho).</b> Its major catalyst was the consolidation of the Zulu Kingdom. They were metalworkers, cultivators of millet, and cattle herders.|$|E
25|$|The Khoisan {{lived in}} the southwestern Cape Province, where winter {{rainfall}} is plentiful. Earlier Khoisan populations were absorbed by Bantu peoples, such as the <b>Sotho</b> and Nguni, but the Bantu expansion stopped at the region with winter rainfall. Some Bantu languages have incorporated the click consonant of the Khoisan languages. The Khoisan traded with their Bantu neighbors, providing cattle, sheep, and hunted items. In return, their Bantu speaking neighbors traded copper, iron, and tobacco.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, the Mbunda fought {{alongside}} Aluyi in the Aluyi/Makololo war in 1830, which ousted the Makololo {{occupation of}} Barotseland, {{leading to the}} establishment of the Mbunda Chieftainship at Lukwakwa under Senior Chief Mwene Sikufele now in Kabompo District, being a descendant of the Mbunda that supported Prince Mubukwanu of the Aluyi. The Makololo from the south introduced the <b>Sotho</b> language spoken not only in Western Province today but also Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa and Caprivi Strip.|$|E
25|$|Irene Mawela (who {{had been}} {{singing in the}} 1960s and 1970s with groups like Mahotella Queens, Sweet Sixteens and the Dark City Sisters) {{significantly}} impacted traditional and contemporary Venda music, despite vocal recordings in Zulu, <b>Sotho</b> and Xhosa languages. Mawela's 1983 release, Khanani Yanga, {{was one of the}} most successful Venda-traditional music albums of that year. After some lean years, Mawela returned to the South African music scene with Tlhokomela Sera, released in December 2007. Mawela's recent numbers like Mme Anga Khotsi Anga and Nnditsheni are very popular. Solomon Matase is known for his hits Ntshavheni and Vho i fara Phele.|$|E
25|$|The biggest star of 1990s gospel was Rebecca Malope, whose 1995 album Shwele Baba was {{extremely}} popular. Malope continues to record, {{in addition to}} performers such as Lusanda Spiritual Group, Barorisi Ba Morena, Amadodana Ase Wesile, Vuyo Mokoena and International Pentacoastal Church Choir, Rayreed Soul Beat, Lundi, Joyous Celebration, and the upcoming Scent From Above who have performed in Botswana occasionally. In 2000s Vuyo Mooena {{has emerged as the}} best selling Gospel artist. His albums have been audited to be in Top 5 selling in the country. In His album he sang in all South African languages like Venda, Shangaan, <b>Sotho,</b> Zulu and Xhosa. The industry has also been joined by the likes of Hlengiwe Mhlaba(whose Aphendule is popular) and Solly Moholo. Also we see the new singers like Oleseng Shuping become popular and he won the king of gospel award.|$|E
25|$|A {{succession}} of wars followed from 1858 to 1868 between the Basotho kingdom and the Boer republic of Orange Free State. In the battles that followed, the Orange Free State {{tried unsuccessfully to}} capture Moshoeshoe's mountain stronghold at Thaba Bosiu, while the <b>Sotho</b> conducted raids in Free State territories. Both sides adopted scorched-earth tactics, with large swathes of pasturage and cropland being destroyed. Faced with starvation, Moshoeshoe signed a peace treaty on 15 October 1858, though crucial boundary issues remained unresolved. War broke out again in 1865. After an unsuccessful appeal for aid from the British Empire, Moshoeshoe signed the 1866 treaty of Thaba Bosiu, with the Basotho ceding substantial territory to the Orange Free State. On 12 March 1868, the British parliament declared the Basotho Kingdom a British protectorate {{and part of the}} British Empire. Open hostilities ceased between the Orange Free State and the Basotho. The country was subsequently named Basutoland and is presently named Lesotho.|$|E
25|$|Archaeologists {{generally}} {{agree that}} the builders probably spoke one of the Shona languages, based upon evidence of pottery, oral traditions and anthropology and were probably descended from the Gokomere culture. The Gokomere culture, an eastern Bantu subgroup, existed in the area from around 500 AD and flourished from 200 AD to about 800 AD. Archaeological evidence indicates that it constitutes an early phase of the Great Zimbabwe culture. The Gokomere culture likely gave rise to both the modern Mashona people, an ethnic cluster comprising distinct sub-ethnic {{groups such as the}} local Karanga clan and the Rozwi culture, which originated as several Shona states. Gokomere-descended groups such as the Shona probably contributed the African component of the ancestry of the Lemba. Gokomere peoples were probably also related to certain nearby early Bantu groups like the Mapungubwe civilisation of neighbouring North eastern South Africa, which {{is believed to have been}} an early Venda-speaking culture, and to the nearby <b>Sotho.</b>|$|E
500|$|Intending to gain {{skills needed}} to become a privy {{councillor}} for the Thembu royal house, in 1933 Mandela began his secondary education at Clarkebury Methodist High School in Engcobo, a Western-style institution that was the largest school for black Africans in Thembuland. Made to socialise with other students on an equal basis, he claimed that he lost his [...] "stuck up" [...] attitude, becoming best friends with a girl for the first time; he began playing sports and developed his lifelong love of gardening. He completed his Junior Certificate in two years, and in 1937 moved to Healdtown, the Methodist college in Fort Beaufort attended by most Thembu royalty, including Justice. The headmaster emphasised the superiority of English culture and government, but Mandela became increasingly interested in native African culture, making his first non-Xhosa friend, a speaker of <b>Sotho,</b> and coming {{under the influence of}} one of his favourite teachers, a Xhosa who broke taboo by marrying a <b>Sotho.</b> Mandela spent much of his spare time at Healdtown as a long-distance runner and boxer, and in his second year he became a prefect.|$|E
500|$|English is {{the main}} {{language}} used in the education and judiciary systems. The Bantu languages Shona and Sindebele are the principal indigenous languages of Zimbabwe. Shona is spoken by 70% of the population, Sindebele by 20%. Other minority Bantu languages include Venda, Tsonga, Shangaan, Kalanga, <b>Sotho,</b> Ndau and Nambya. Less than 2.5%, mainly the white and [...] "coloured" [...] (mixed race) minorities, consider English their native language. Shona has a rich oral tradition, which was incorporated into the first Shona novel, Feso by Solomon Mutswairo, published in 1956.

500|$|In 1966, both Makeba and Belafonte {{received}} the Grammy Award for Best Folk Recording for An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba. The album {{dealt with the}} political plight of black South Africans under apartheid, including several songs critical of the South African government, such as [...] "Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd" [...] ("Watch our Verwoerd", a reference to Hendrik Verwoerd, one of the architects of apartheid). It sold widely and raised Makeba's profile in the US; Belafonte and Makeba's concert tour following its release was often sold out, and the album {{has been described as}} the best they made together. Makeba's use of lyrics in Swahili, Xhosa, and <b>Sotho</b> led to her being seen as a representation of an [...] "authentic" [...] Africa by American audiences. In 1967, more than ten years after she first recorded the song, the single [...] "Pata Pata" [...] was released in the US on an album of the same title, and became a worldwide hit. During its recording, she and Belafonte had a disagreement, after which they stopped recording together.|$|E

2500|$|The 'gun war' – {{defeat of}} colonial forces. The Basotho {{continued}} to use their horse-gun system under the new colonial regime to maintain their independence. In the 1880s, their territory was annexed by Cape Colony and a punitive expedition of 800 white troops and 1500 African allies was dispatched to crush the opposition of one Moorosi, a dissenting <b>Sotho</b> chieftain. Moorosi gathered some 300 gunmen in a strong mountaintop position and fought off the colonial forces for over 8 months. After three major assaults, and continuous shelling by artillery, the position was overrun, Moroosi was killed and his lands seized. As the struggle with Moorosi raged, colonial authorities reserved part of Basutoland for white settlement and demanded that all natives surrender their firearms. This demand was rejected and another British expedition was dispatched to liquidate resistance, sparking the so-called [...] "Gun War." [...] The <b>Sotho</b> horsemen however used a flexible mix of tactics: defensive positions on fortified hills, attacks against administrative centers of the colonial regime, and frequent use of guerrilla strikes and ambushes against lumbering colonial columns, most notably a column of British lancers at Qalabani. The combination of mobility, firepower, ambushes, and hit and run strikes was sufficient to stalemate or defeat the Basotho's enemies for almost a year. Stymied, the colonial army, and the disarmanent demand was withdrawn.|$|E
