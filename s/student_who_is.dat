His first draft, dated May 3, 1985, changed the main plot device to a Garden of Immortal Peaches. It begins in 1937, with Indiana battling the murderous ghost of Baron Seamus Seagrove III in Scotland. Indiana travels to Mozambique to aid Dr. Clare Clarke (a Katharine Hepburn type {{according}} to Lucas), who has found a 200-year-old pygmy. The pygmy is kidnapped by the Nazis during a boat chase, and Indiana, Clare and Scraggy Brier—an old friend of Indiana—travel up the Zambezi river to rescue him. Indiana is killed in the climactic battle but is resurrected by the Monkey King. Other characters include a cannibalistic African tribe; Nazi Sergeant Gutterbuhg, who has a mechanical arm; Betsy, a stowaway <b>student</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> suicidally in love with Indiana; and a pirate leader named Kezure (described as a Toshiro Mifune type), who dies eating a peach {{because he is not}} pure of heart.|$|E

This master thesis {{has been}} revised and {{approved}} by: Advisor 1. Prof. Dr. I Ketut Seken, M. A., Advisor 2. Prof. Dr. Nyoman Padmadewi, M. A. Key words: GIST, learning style, reading comprehension, conventional reading technique This study concerned with experimental research which investigated {{whether or not}} there is any effect of Generating Interaction between Schemata and Text (GIST) and learning style on reading comprehension, and to investigate the relationship between the use of GIST, conventional reading technique and learning style. This study was carried out in SMA Dwijendra Bualu on grade XI students through a 2 X 4 true-experimental research design where the participants were homogenously The students in experimental group were taught using GIST while the students in control group were taught using conventional reading technique. Each group consisted of students with visual, aural, read-write, kinesthetic learning style. Therefore, there were eight groups altogether; <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> taught using GIST with visual learning style, <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> taught using conventional reading technique with visual learning style, <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> taught using GIST with aural learning style, <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> taught using conventional reading technique aural learning style. <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> taught using GIST with read-write learning style, <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> taught using conventional reading technique with read-write learning style, <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> taught using GIST with kinesthetic learning style, and <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> taught using conventional reading technique kinesthetic learning style.
