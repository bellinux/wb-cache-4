5|$|President Dwight D.

5|$|After he was honorably {{discharged}} in 1946, O'Neill {{studied for}} an undergraduate degree in physics and mathematics at Swarthmore College. As a child he had discussed {{the possibilities of}} humans in space with his parents, and in college he enjoyed working on rocket equations. However, {{he did not see}} <b>space</b> <b>science</b> as an option for a career path in physics, choosing instead to pursue high-energy physics. In 1950 he graduated with Phi Beta Kappa honors. O'Neill performed his graduate studies at Cornell University {{with the help of an}} Atomic Energy Commission fellowship, and was awarded a Ph.D. in physics in 1954.|$|E
5|$|After leaving office, Kalam {{became a}} visiting {{professor}} at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the Indian Institute of Management Indore; an honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore; chancellor of the Indian Institute of <b>Space</b> <b>Science</b> and Technology Thiruvananthapuram; professor of Aerospace Engineering at Anna University; and an adjunct at many other academic and research institutions across India. He taught information technology at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, and technology at Banaras Hindu University and Anna University.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} The Technology Edge, {{published}} in 1983, O'Neill wrote about economic competition with Japan. He {{argued that the}} United States had to develop six industries to compete: microengineering, robotics, genetic engineering, magnetic flight, family aircraft, and <b>space</b> <b>science.</b> He also thought that industrial development was suffering from short-sighted executives, self-interested unions, high taxes, and poor education of Americans. According to reviewer Henry Weil, O'Neill's detailed explanations of emerging technologies differentiated the book from others on the subject.|$|E
40|$|In this study, it {{was aimed}} to {{determine}} the levels of the ability of science teaching fourth grade students to transfer their knowledge of astronomy and <b>space</b> <b>sciences</b> to daily life {{within the scope of}} the Astronomy and <b>Space</b> <b>Sciences</b> lesson. For this purpose, the research method was designed as the mixed method including both the quantitative and qualitative process, and the sample of the study consisted of 65 students selected with criterion sampling and easily accessible sampling method. The Astronomy and <b>Space</b> <b>Sciences</b> Knowledge Test (ASSKT) was used in order to measure the students’ knowledge of astronomy and <b>space</b> <b>sciences,</b> and the Transfer of the Astronomy and <b>Space</b> <b>Sciences</b> Knowledge to Daily Life Interview Form (TASSDLIF) was used in order {{to determine the}} transfer of the astronomy and <b>space</b> <b>sciences</b> knowledge to daily life. The state of the correlation between the ASSKT and TASSDLIF scores of the students was determined in the quantitative part of the study and the levels of students’ ability to transfer the subjects of astronomy and <b>space</b> <b>sciences</b> to daily life were determined in the qualitative part. As a result of the study, a significant, positive and weak level of the relationship was determined between the ASSKT and TASSDLIF scores. It was concluded that there were zero transfer, incomplete transfer and full transfer in the students’ states of the ability to transfer their knowledge of astronomy and <b>space</b> <b>sciences</b> to daily life. The subjects with the highest full transfer are “Finding Directions, Telescopes, and Gravity”, while the subjects with the lowest full transfer are the “Star Distances, Conception of the Universe, and Earth’s Crust”...|$|R

5|$|Chronic underinvestment in {{research}} since 1990 forced many scientific professionals {{to leave the}} country. As a result, Bulgaria scores low in terms of innovation, competitiveness and high-value added exports. Principal areas {{of research and development}} are energy, nanotechnology, archaeology and medicine. The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAS) is the leading scientific establishment and employs most Bulgarian researchers in its numerous institutes. It has been active in the field of <b>space</b> <b>science</b> with RADOM-7 radiation monitoring experiments on the International Space Station and Chandrayaan-1, and domestically developed space greenhouses on the Mir space station. Bulgaria became the sixth country in the world to have an astronaut in space with Georgi Ivanov's flight on Soyuz 33 in 1979. Bulgaria is an active member of CERN and has contributed to its activities with nearly 200 scientists since its accession in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Glenn {{remained}} {{an officer in}} the Marine Corps after his selection, but was assigned to the NASA Space Task Group at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The task force moved to Houston, Texas, in 1962, and became part of the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center. A portion of the astronauts' training was in <b>space</b> <b>science,</b> but it had a practical aspect, which included scuba diving and work in simulators. Astronauts secured an additional role in the spaceflight program: to provide pilot input in design. The astronauts divided the various tasks between them. Glenn's specialisation was cockpit layout design and control functioning for the Mercury and early Apollo programs. He pressed the other astronauts to set a moral example, living up to the squeaky-clean image of them that had been portrayed by Life magazine, a position that was not popular with the other astronauts.|$|E
5|$|In June 1975, O'Neill led a ten-week {{study of}} {{permanent}} space habitats at NASA Ames. During the study {{he was called}} away to testify on July 23 to the House Subcommittee on <b>Space</b> <b>Science</b> and Applications. On January 19, 1976, he also appeared before the Senate Subcommittee on Aerospace Technology and National Needs. In a presentation titled Solar Power from Satellites, he laid out his case for an Apollo-style program for building power plants in space. He returned to Ames in June 1976 and 1977 to lead studies on space manufacturing. In these studies, NASA developed detailed plans to establish bases on the Moon where space-suited workers would mine the mineral resources needed to build space colonies and solar power satellites.|$|E

5|$|The agency's leader, NASA's administrator, is {{nominated}} by the President of the United States {{subject to approval}} of the US Senate, and reports {{to him or her}} and serves as senior <b>space</b> <b>science</b> advisor. Though space exploration is ostensibly non-partisan, the appointee usually is associated with the President's political party (Democratic or Republican), and a new administrator is usually chosen when the Presidency changes parties. The only exceptions to this have been: James C. Fletcher, appointed by Republican Richard Nixon but stayed through May 1977 into the term of Democrat Jimmy Carter; Daniel Goldin, appointed by Republican George H. W. Bush and stayed through the administration of Democrat Bill Clinton; and Robert M. Lightfoot, Jr., associate administrator under Democrat Barack Obama kept on as acting administrator by Republican Donald Trump. Though the agency is independent, the survival or discontinuation of projects can depend directly on the will of the President.|$|E
