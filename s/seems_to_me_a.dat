500|$|Drawing {{attention}} to the intrinsically manipulative nature of the medium, Nolan uses narrative and stylistic techniques (notably mise en abyme and recursions) to stimulate the viewer to ask themselves why his films are put together in such ways and why the films provoke particular responses. He sometimes uses editing {{as a way to}} represent the characters' psychological states, merging their subjectivity with that of the audience. For example, in Memento the fragmented sequential order of scenes is to put the audience into a similar experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories. In The Prestige, the series of magic tricks and themes of duality and deception mirror the structural narrative of the film. His writing style incorporates a number of storytelling techniques such as flashbacks, shifting points of view and unreliable narrators. Scenes are often interrupted by the unconventional editing style of cutting away quickly from the money shot (or nearly cutting off characters' dialogue) and crosscutting several scenes of parallel action to build to a climax. In 2017, noted film theorist and historian David Bordwell wrote about Nolan's fascination with subjective storytelling and crosscutting, [...] "It's rare to find any mainstream director so relentlessly focused on exploring a particular batch of storytelling techniques ... Nolan zeroes in, from film to film, on a few narrative devices, finding new possibilities in what most directors handle routinely. He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> very thoughtful, almost theoretical director in his fascination with turning certain conventions this way and that, to reveal their unexpected possibilities." ...|$|E
2500|$|Contemporary {{opinions}} of Mussorgsky as a composer and person varied from positive to ambiguous to negative. Mussorgsky's eventual supporters, Stasov and Balakirev, initially registered strongly negative {{impressions of the}} composer. Stasov wrote Balakirev, in an 1863 letter, [...] "I have no use for Mussorgsky. His views may tally with mine, but I have never heard him express an intelligent idea. All in him is flabby, dull. He is, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>a</b> thorough idiot", and Balakirev agreed: [...] "Yes, Mussorgsky is little short of an idiot." ...|$|E

2500|$|McLuhan {{frequently}} quoted Walter Ong's Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue (1958), which evidently had prompted McLuhan {{to write}} The Gutenberg Galaxy. Ong wrote a highly favorable review {{of this new}} book in America. However, Ong later tempered his praise, by describing McLuhan's The Gutenberg Galaxy as [...] "a racy survey, indifferent to some scholarly detail, but uniquely valuable in suggesting the sweep and depth of the cultural and psychological changes entailed in the passage from illiteracy to print and beyond." [...] McLuhan himself said of the book, [...] "I'm not concerned to get any kudos out of [...] It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> book that somebody should have written a century ago. I wish somebody else had written it. It will be a useful prelude to the rewrite of Understanding Media [...] that I'm doing now." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{last of the}} Alfredian {{works is}} one which bears the name Blostman, i.e. [...] "Blooms" [...] or Anthology. The first half is based mainly on the Soliloquies of St Augustine of Hippo, the {{remainder}} is drawn from various sources. The material has traditionally been thought to contain much that is Alfred's own and highly characteristic of him. The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings. [...] "Therefore, he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while {{he is in the}} world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear." [...] Alfred appears as a character in the twelfth- or thirteenth-century poem The Owl and the Nightingale where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised. The Proverbs of Alfred, a thirteenth-century work, contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with Alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom.|$|E
2500|$|Kirkus Reviews concluded: [...] "Despite its provocative title, a {{scientific}} yet superbly compassionate exposition." [...] The book received praise from gay sexual behavior scientist Simon LeVay, from sex-differences expert David Buss, and from research psychologist Steven Pinker, who wrote: [...] "The Man Who Would Be Queen may upset {{the guardians of}} political correctness on {{both the left and}} the right, but it will be welcomed by intellectually curious people of all sexes and sexual orientations." [...] It also received praise from conservative journalist [...] Steve Sailer, as well as Fortune magazine's Daniel Seligman, and Mark Henderson. [...] Conservative commentator John Derbyshire [...] said: [...] "a wealth of fascinating information, carefully gathered by (it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me)</b> <b>a</b> conscientious and trustworthy scientific observer." [...] It also received a positive review from writer Ethan Boatner of Lavender magazine and Duncan Osborne in Out. Research psychologist James Cantor also wrote a positive review of the book in the newsletter of APA's Society for the Psychological Study of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Issues (Division 44).|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} scenes was the film's ending: Brian's crucifixion. Many Christian protesters said that it was mocking Jesus' suffering by turning it into a [...] "Jolly Boys Outing" [...] (such as when Mr Cheeky turns to Brian and says: [...] "See, not so bad once you're up!"), capped by Brian's fellow sufferers suddenly bursting into song. This is also reinforced by the fact that several characters throughout the film claim crucifixion is not as bad as it seems, such as when Brian asks his cellmate in prison what will happen to him, and he replies: [...] "Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion", and when Matthias, the old man who works with the PFJ, dismisses crucifixion as [...] "a doddle" [...] and says being stabbed would be worse. The director, Terry Jones, issued the following riposte to this criticism: [...] "Any religion that makes a form of torture into an icon that they worship <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> pretty sick sort of religion quite honestly." [...] Religious figures later responded by saying that Jones did not seem to understand the meaning of the crucifix symbol or its significance to Christians as a reminder of the suffering and death Christ endured for their sake. The Pythons also argued that crucifixion was a standard form of execution in ancient times and not just one especially reserved for Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|Through his wife's {{professional}} connections, Harty secured {{his first}} important conducting engagement in London. He conducted the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) {{in a performance}} of With the Wild Geese in March 1911. The performance was [...] well received, and Harty was engaged to conduct the LSO again during its 1912–13 season. Hoping to repeat his success as a composer-conductor, he gave the first performance of his Variations on a Dublin Air in February 1913. His concerts this time were not successful with the critics or the public, and the orchestra made a loss. Although the LSO did not invite him back for the next season Harty [...] was invited to conduct Tristan und Isolde and Carmen at Covent Garden in 1913. His performance as an operatic conductor {{was less than a}} triumph. After Carmen, the critic of The Times complained that [...] "Mr Harty's rigid beat and inflexible tempi petrified [...] delicate and fragile phrases, and made them sound like quotations from some forgotten German score." [...] Harty later admitted that he was not greatly in sympathy with opera as a genre: [...] "Opera <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> form of art in which clumsy attempts are made at defining the indefinable suggestions of music. Or else one in which the author of a plot and his actors are hampered by music which prolongs their gestures and action to absurdity and obscures the sense of their words." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prayer <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> cry of weakness, and {{an attempt}} to avoid, by trickery, {{the rules of the}} game as laid down. I do not choose to admit weakness. I accept the {{challenge}} of responsibility. Life, as it is, does not frighten me, since I have made my peace with the universe as I find it, and bow to its laws. The ever-sleepless sea in its bed, crying out [...] "how long?" [...] to Time; million-formed and never motionless flame; the contemplation of these two aspects alone, affords me sufficient food for ten spans of my expected lifetime. It seems to me that organized creeds are collections of words around a wish. I feel no need for such. However, I would not, by word or deed, attempt to deprive another of the consolation it affords. It is simply not for me. Somebody else may have my rapturous glance at the archangels. The springing of the yellow line of morning out of the misty deep of dawn, is glory enough for me. I know that nothing is destructible; things merely change forms. When the consciousness we know as life ceases, I know that I shall still be part and parcel of the world. I was a part before the sun rolled into shape and burst forth in the glory of change. I was, when the earth was hurled out from its fiery rim. I shall return with the earth to Father Sun, and still exist in substance when the sun has lost its fire, and disintegrated into infinity to perhaps become a part of the whirling rubble of space. Why fear? The stuff of my being is matter, ever changing, ever moving, but never lost; so what need of denominations and creeds to deny myself the comfort of all my fellow men? The wide belt of the universe has no need for finger-rings. I am one with the infinite and need no other assurance.|$|E
