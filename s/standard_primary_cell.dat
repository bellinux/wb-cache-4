The program plan has been modified {{in the past year}} to reflect changes in the agency's approach to battery related problems that are affecting flight programs. Primary attention in the Battery Program is being devoted to the development of an advanced nickel-cadmium cell design and the qualification of vendors to produce cells for flight programs.

40|$|Closed accessCommon {{symptoms}} of different neurodegenerative diseases start {{to develop in}} the second half of the human life. Several of these diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are accompanied by severe disturbances of protein metabolism and homeostasis in the brain. Because microglial cells are, to some extent, responsible for the maintenance of this homeostasis, age-related functional changes of the microglia are important. We established, therefore, the preparation of cultures of <b>primary</b> microglial <b>cells</b> isolated from adult animals in comparison to the widely used <b>standard</b> model, <b>primary</b> microglial <b>cells</b> isolated from newborn animals. In addition, we investigated changes in the activation and in the protein homeostasis within these cells. The protein turn-over seems to be significantly impaired in microglial cells isolated from adult animals and this seems to be accompanied by a decline in proteasomal function, but not in the protease content. We were also able to demonstrate higher cell surface molecule expression and a higher basal NO release of microglia isolated from adult animals in comparison to the microglia isolated from newborn rats; however, the PMA stimulated oxidative burst was abolished completely in cells from adult animals. Microglia from adult animals were also not able to upregulate their protein metabolism after activation. From these investigations it was concluded that microglial cells from adult animals have significantly different metabolic properties in comparison to the widely used microglial cells from newborn animals...|$|R

The ER- 2 test platform is the latest system developed by the Glenn Research Center (GRC) for near-space photovoltaic characterization. This system offers several improvements over GRC's current Learjet platform including higher altitude, larger testing area, onboard spectrometers, and longer flight season. The ER- 2 system was developed by GRC in cooperation with NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) as well as partners at the Naval Research Laboratory and Air Force Research Laboratory. The system was designed and built between June and September of 2014, with the integration and first flights taking place at AFRC's Palmdale facility in October of 2014. Three flights were made testing cells from GRC as well as commercial industry partners. Cell performance data was successfully collected on all three flights as well as solar spectra.

40|$|Background: The {{cellular}} and inflammatory {{responses in}} airway epithelial cells in cystic fibrosis (CF) {{is being investigated}} {{in the study of}} CF pathophysiology. Human rhinovirus (HRV) is an important trigger of exacerbations in cystic fibrosis (CF). Either <b>cell</b> lines or <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> cultures can be used to study the response of CF epithelial cells in vitro. The use of cell models has an advantage over <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> models, as <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> are difficult to obtain. However, uncertainty exists about how accurately the inflammatory response of cell models reflect that of <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> cultures. Aims: 	 To investigate if cell models have similar cellular and inflammatory responses to HRV compared to <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> and to determine which of the cell models assessed closely resembles <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> models. Methods: This investigation compared the cellular and inflammatory responses to HRV in healthy and CF immortalized and telomere shortened epithelial cell models to the responses found in their <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> counterparts. Cytopathic effect, susceptibility to HRV 1 B, viability, apoptotic response and inflammatory cytokine production (IL- 8 and IL- 6) were determined under basal conditions and after HRV 1 B infection. Results: Similarities were found between the <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> and cell models when investigating the cytopathic effect (CPE). Furthermore, HRV 1 B had a comparable effect on the viability among the <b>primary</b> <b>cells,</b> NuLi- 1 ’s and CuFi- 1 ’s. However, when the susceptibility to HRV 1 B was compared it showed that except for the BEAS 2 B-s, all of the cell models had a minimal response compared to the <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> Furthermore, both the generated CF airway epithelial cell models expressed a lower apoptotic response and appeared to have lower cytokine productions (IL- 8 and IL- 6) in response to HRV 1 B. Conclusion: Generated cell models differ in their cellular and inflammatory responses compared to that of their primary counterparts. Furthermore this study demonstrated that the telomere shortened cell models reflected more truly the cellular and inflammatory response of <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> to HRV 1 B infection compared to immortalised cell models. ...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{lines are}} often used in place of <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> to study {{biological}} processes. However, {{care must be taken}} when interpreting the results as cell lines do not always accurately replicate the <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> In this article, we will briefly talk about advantages and disadvantages of cell lines and then discuss results using the mouse Sertoli cell line, MSC- 1, compared with <b>primary</b> mouse Sertoli <b>cells.</b> MSC- 1 cells resemble Sertoli cells morphologically and possess several biochemical markers associated with Sertoli cells. Studies have demonstrated that the function and regulation of retinoic acid receptor a (RARa) is similar between MSC- 1 and rat Sertoli cells. However, MSC- 1 cells lack some of the immune privilege properties associated with <b>primary</b> Sertoli <b>cells,</b> including survival in animals with a fully functional immune system.

40|$|Cajal bodies (CBs) are nuclear {{structures}} that {{are thought to}} have diverse functions, including small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) biogenesis. The phosphorylation status of coilin, the CB marker protein, might impact CB formation. We hypothesize that <b>primary</b> <b>cells,</b> which lack CBs, contain different phosphoisoforms of coilin compared with that found in transformed cells, which have CBs. Localization, self-association and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies on coilin phosphomutants all suggest this modification impacts the function of coilin and may thus contribute towards CB formation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrates that coilin is hyperphosphorylated in <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> compared with transformed cells. mRNA levels of the nuclear phosphatase PPM 1 G are significantly reduced in <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> and expression of PPM 1 G in <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> induces CBs. Additionally, PPM 1 G can dephosphorylate coilin in vitro. Surprisingly, however, expression of green fluorescent protein alone is sufficient to form CBs in <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> Taken together, our data support a model whereby coilin is the target of an uncharacterized signal transduction cascade that responds to the increased transcription and snRNP demands found in transformed cells...|$|R
