40|$|To {{ensure the}} {{long-term}} conservation and sustainable use of straddling fish stocks, the 1995 United Nations Fish Stock Agreement {{calls for the}} establishment of regional fisheries management organizations to manage such stocks. This paper studies the potential for cooperation in straddling stock fisheries when the cooperative coalition of countries acts as a Stackelberg leader against the remaining singleton countries. It is demonstrated that an increase in the cooperation level leads to an increase not only in the steady-state fish stock, but also in the total rent of the fishery. Further, the outlook for cooperation is better within the Stackelberg game, where the cooperative coalition acts as a leader, than in the Cournot game. At the stable equilibrium of a Stackelberg game, not only is the steady-state fish stock higher, but also the total resource rent, participants ’ rent and non-participants ’ rent are higher than those of the Cournot–Nash stable equilibrium. The new-entrant issue is also a problem for the conservation of the fish stock in the Stackelberg game. According to the present research, the prospects of cooperation in utilizing a <b>straddling</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> are not unlikely if the cooperative coalition acts as a leader. This is an important implication for policymakers when discussing an agreement for establishing a regional fisheries management organization (RFMO) to manage a <b>straddling</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stock...</b>|$|E

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the 20 th century, many shared {{fish stocks}} {{throughout}} the world have been found in extreme danger of collapse. There are many calls for cooperation in utilizing and conserving the shared fish resources including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 1995 UN Fish Stock Agreement. This study provides an important rationale for cooperation in utilizing a shared fish stock with several interested parties. The rationale is that an increase in the cooperation level leads to an increase not only in the steady-state fish stock, but also in total rent of the fishery.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{management}} of straddling fish stocks is approached through a coalition game in partition function form. A two-stage game is applied, assuming ex ante symmetric players and the classical Gordon-Schaefer bioeconomic model. It is shown that the game is characterized by positive externalities — the merger of coalitions increases the payoffs of players who belong to other coalitions. A key result is that, apart from the case of two players, the grand coalition is not a Nash equilibrium outcome. Furthermore, {{in the case of}} three or more players the only Nash equilibrium coalition structure is the one formed by singletons. The results indicate that the prospects of cooperation in straddling stock fisheries are low if players can free ride cooperative agreements. Thus, in order to protect cooperation, under the aegis of regional fishery management organizations, unregulated fishing must be prevented.

40|$|Abstract onlyThe U. N. Agreement, {{arising from}} the U. N. Conference on <b>Straddling</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>Stocks</b> and Highly Migratory <b>Fish</b> <b>Stocks,</b> 1993 - 1995, is close to {{achieving}} the number ratifications required to enter into force. The Agreement is, moreover, currently serving {{as a framework for}} the cooperative management of several straddling and highly migratory fishery resources {{in various parts of the}} world. The long term viability of the U. N. Agreement is, however, far from being assured. Straddling and highly migratory <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> constitute a class of transboundary fishery resources that are particularly difficult to manage effectively. This paper reviews the history of the U. N.

Either problem, should it remains unresolved, could undermine the Agreement. The paper extends earlier discussions of the issue by drawing upon the results of a recently completed two year research project: “The Management of High Seas Fisheries”, and upon the results and conclusions of a conference on “The Management of <b>Straddling</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>Stocks</b> and Highly Migratory <b>Fish</b> <b>Stocks</b> and the U.

40|$|The article {{offers an}} {{analysis}} of the globalisation debate in the context of international fisheries governance. It argues that there are significant transformations in fisheries policy-making in international economics, international institutions and international law-making which alter state authority in fisheries management. Thus, decision-making at international, regional and national levels is increasing, displaced from the state level. This 'multi-level' decision-making is exemplified in the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation's Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, 1995. The Code represents a sound instrument of fisheries governance, capable of responding to contemporary global transformations. Changes are illustrated by comparing the Code and the Agreement on <b>Straddling</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>Stocks</b> and Highly Migratory <b>Fish</b> <b>Stocks,</b> 1995, in the areas of international economics, institutions and law-making. Reference is made to interaction between a range of actors and to formal and informal procedures.

A three-players characteristic function game (c-game) is used to analyze the cooperative agreements. The analysis focuses on the sharing of total net returns from cooperation. Three sharing rules are calculated; namely, the Nucleolus, the Shapley value, and the Nash bargaining solution. The analysis is based on simulation and optimization results from a multi-gear, age-structured, bioeconomic model developed for the North Atlantic bluefin tuna fisheries, East and West stocks. The results show, as expected, that significant gains can be attained from cooperation. The different sharing rules for the distribution of gains provide different returns to each player.

The benefits of a grand coalition may be distributed differently, depending on the negotiating members' harvesting efficiency and the concept of fairness chosen during negotiation. In the paper, we examine three such concepts: nucleolus, Shapley-value, and egalitarian. In general, a fleet's harvesting efficiency will determine the contribution it makes to any subcoalitions, or the grand coalition, in which it is the last to join. Analysis shows that the imputation to each member under each fairness concept differs according to whether the maximum, or the average, contribution is used, or whether the contribution can be regarded as bargaining power at all. By making certain assumptions regarding fleet efficiency, we calculated the exact imputation under each fairness concept and compared the change from one to another. Conclusions are then drawn with suggested further research. Institutional and Behavioral Economics, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
