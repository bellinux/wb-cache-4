5|$|A second {{access to}} the castle leads up from a rocky cove, the {{aperture}} to a marine cave on the northern side of the Dunnottar cliffs into which a small boat could be brought. From here a steep path leads to the well-fortified postern gate on the cliff top, which in turn offers {{access to the}} castle via the Water Gate in the palace. Artillery defences, taking the form of earthworks, surround the north-west corner of the castle, facing inland, and the south-east, facing seaward. A small sentry box or guard house <b>stands</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> eastern battery, overlooking the coast.|$|E

In the small provincial community where they live, neither she nor Huus dares to break the conventions they know, sad as it all may be.

500|$|Despite its {{widespread}} usage, {{the classification}} {{has been criticized}} for its complexity and limited scope of scheme-adjustment. In particular, the arrangement of subheadings has been described as archaic and as being biased towards an Anglo-American world view. In 200708, the Maricopa County Library District in Arizona, abandoned the DDC in favor of the Book Industry Standards and Communications (BISAC) system, one that is commonly used by commercial bookstores, {{in an effort to make}} their libraries more accessible for patrons. Several other libraries across the United States, and other countries (including Canada and the Netherlands) followed suit. The classification has also been criticized as being a proprietary system licensed by a single entity (OCLC), making it expensive to adopt. However, book classification critic Justin Newlan <b>stands</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Dewey Decimal System, stating newer, more advanced book classification systems [...] "are too confusing to understand for newcomers".|$|E

After the autopsy, it is determined that Irving suffered from a prion disease called kuru, which has not been found in the United States before. Mulder believes that kuru was given to him by a hex that caused him to go mad.

Newton Heath's first league match at Bank Street was played against Burnley on 1 September 1893, when 10,000 people saw Alf Farman score a hat-trick, Newton Heath's only goals in a 3–2 win.
