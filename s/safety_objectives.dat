40|$|The {{workforce}} scheduling with combined <b>safety</b> {{and productivity}} <b>objective</b> is introduced. Typically, industrial workers {{are assigned to}} perform a set of tasks with certain safety/ergonomics hazard. To reduce their hazard exposures, {{it is recommended that}} workers be rotated among the tasks periodically within each day so that the hazard exposures do not exceed a permissible limit. Since workers have unequal skill levels, this job rotation practice can affect total system productivity. Thus, assigning the right workers to the right tasks in each period can help to increase the productivity and, at the same time, achieve the <b>safety</b> <b>objective.</b> In this paper, we present a safety-productivity workforce scheduling model. From a given numerical example, we compare the optimal solutions obtained from the productivity-based, safety-based, and safety-productivity workforce scheduling models. A heuristic approach to the workforce scheduling with combined <b>safety</b> and productivity <b>objective</b> is also developed for solving large-sized problems. Significance: While job rotation can help to enhance workplace safety, it is likely to reduce the system productivity since workers might be assigned to perform the tasks that they are not competent. This workforce scheduling problem considers both safety and productivity when developing the worker-task-period assignment solution. Thus, both <b>safety</b> and productivity <b>objectives</b> can be simultaneously achieved...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} concurrent {{games played}} on graphs. At every {{round of a}} game, each player simultaneously and independently selects a move; the moves jointly determine {{the transition to a}} successor state. Two basic <b>objectives</b> are the <b>safety</b> <b>objective</b> to stay forever in a given set of states, and its dual, the reachability objective to reach a given set of states. We present in this paper a strategy improvement algorithm for computing the value of a concurrent safety game, that is, the maximal probability with which player 1 can enforce the <b>safety</b> <b>objective.</b> The algorithm yields a sequence of player- 1 strategies which ensure probabilities of winning that converge monotonically to the value of the safety game. Our result is significant because the strategy improvement algorithm provides, for the first time, a way to approximate the value of a concurrent safety game from below. Since a value iteration algorithm, or a strategy improvement algorithm for reachability games, can be used to approximate the same value from above, the combination of both algorithms yields a method for computing a converging sequence of upper and lower bounds for the values of concurrent reachability and safety games. Previous methods could approximate the values of these games only from one direction, and as no rates of convergence are known, they did not provide a practical way to solve these games...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{scheduling}} {{of a set}} of networked control systems implemented over a shared communication network. Each control loop is described by a linear-time-invariant (LTI) system with an event-triggered implementation. We assume the network can be used by at most one control loop at any time instant and after each controller update, a pre-defined channel occupancy time elapses before the network is available. In our framework we offer the scheduler two options to avoid conflicts: using the event-triggering mechanism, where the scheduler can choose the triggering coefficient; or forcing controller updates at an earlier pre-defined time. Our objective is avoiding communication conflict while guaranteeing stability of all control loops. We formulate the original scheduling problem as a control synthesis problem over a network of timed game automata (NTGA) with a <b>safety</b> <b>objective.</b> The NTGA is obtained by taking the parallel composition of the timed game automata (TGA) associated with the network and with all control loops. The construction of TGA associated with control loops leverages recent results on the abstraction of timing models of event-triggered LTI systems. In our problem, the <b>safety</b> <b>objective</b> is to avoid that update requests from a control loop happen while the network is in use by another task. We showcase the results in some examples.

40|$|We {{present a}} methodcllogy for synthesizing hybrid {{controllers}} that meet multiple control objectives. Our methodology uses game theoretic techniques to classify all controls {{that can be}} used to meet the high priority objectives. Lower priority objectives are then optimized within this class. 1 l[ntroduction Hybrid systems, that is systems that involve the interaction of discrete and continuous dynamics, have recently attracted considerable attention (for a discussion of research directions in this field see [l]). In this paper we address hybrid control problems, in particular ones where multiple requirements are imposed on the design. In such st multi-objective setting some of the requirements are usually assumed to be more important than others, either explicitly or implicitly. For simplicity we restrict lour attention to two performance criteria. We will use ~afety to refer to the high priority criterion and eficienc y to refer to the low priority one. Using optimal control tools we attempt to determine the largest controlled invariant safe set, i. e. the largest set of states for which there exists a control such that the <b>safety</b> <b>objective</b> ciln be met. In the process we also determine the class of least restrictive safe controls, i. e. all the controls {{that can be used}} to meet the <b>safety</b> <b>objective</b> from the safe states. The efficiency objective can then be optimized within this class. The resulting controller will typically be hybrid as it involves switching between the safe and efficient controllers. Our analysis is based on the hybrid system modeling formalism introduced in [2]. The design algorithm (Section 2) is motivated by three examples. The first is ‘Research supported by the ARO under grant DAAH 04 - 95...|$|R

40|$|The {{observed}} {{trend of}} decreasing poverty in Tunisian rural areas, where agriculture is still dominated {{by family and}} where illiteracy rate and family size are high, questions may be raised about the economic policies adopted by the state. This article puts the analyses of these policies {{in the framework of}} food safety issue as food and poverty are tightly related and as food <b>safety</b> <b>objective</b> is multi-sectorial and multi-disciplinary. In economic development plans, food <b>safety</b> <b>objective</b> took the place of self-sufficiency. The analysis of food safety policy is based on a macro-economic analysis of the offer (policies of production pricing and subsidizing, investment policies) and demand (Policies of consumption subsidies and consumer prices) as well as the policies of fight against poverty. This analysis covers two periods: before and after the economic reforms of privatization and liberalization of 1987 (PAS: Structural Adjustment Plan). The assessment of these policies shows that poverty fighting programs are numerous and rich in experiences. These policies are more and more based on assistance programs oriented toward productive actions. The liberalization and privatization efforts were reflected by better performance and competitiveness of the agricultural sector. This had a positive impact on the employment, the migration and the availability of food products in rural areas. The self targeting of the subsidies by differentiating the products reduced the budgetary cost of these transfers and enhanced the equity and the nutritional and food situation of the poor people. The higher increase in income of country people and the decrease of subsidies indicate the more and more use of income direct transfers.

40|$|When {{determining}} the Appropriate Level of Protection (ALOP) in food safety law, developed countries {{rely on the}} Food <b>Safety</b> <b>Objective</b> (FSO) {{to meet the requirements}} of World Trade Organization (WTO) law and to provide a high level of protection based on insights from food safety science. Implementing an FSO/ALOP is resource-intensive and costly. Developing countries who would like to provide similar levels of protection are restricted by limited resources and often face difficulties implementing such an FSO-based ALOP. As a consequence, developing countries may base their ALOP on other legally acceptable reasons, which are non-scientific and less effective. We illustrate a less resource-intensive way to implement the FSO in the ALOP, which enables developing countries to design an ALOP that is based on food safety science.

40|$|Monotone systems, {{also known}} as order-preserving or {{cooperative}} systems, are prevalent in models of engineering applications such as transportation and biological networks. In this paper, we investigate the problem of finding a control strategy for a discrete time monotone system with bounded uncertainties such that {{the evolution of the}} system is guaranteed to be confined to a safe set in the state space for all times. By exploiting monotonicity, we propose an approach to this problem which is based on constraint programming. We find control strategies that are based on repetitions of finite sequences of control actions. We show that, under assumptions made in the paper, safety control of monotone systems does not require state measurement.
