50|$|Thioridazine is a racemic {{compound}} with two enantiomers, {{both of which}} are metabolized, according to Eap et al., by CYP2D6 into (S)- and (R)-thioridazine-2-sulfoxide, better known as mesoridazine, and into (S)- and (R)-thioridazine-5-sulfoxide. Mesoridazine is in turn metabolized into <b>sulforidazine.</b> Thioridazine is an inhibitor of CYP1A2 and CYP3A2.|$|E
