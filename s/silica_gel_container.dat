40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of gel formation using the newly developed Fluctuating Bond Aggregation (FBA) algorithm are presented. This algorithm allows possible cluster deformations during aggregation by considering a tuning bond flexibility parameter F. Three-dimensional computer simulations show that for large F, {{there is a}} well-defined threshold value of concentration c below which the realization of all intra-aggregate bond possibilities prevents {{the formation of a}} gelling network. For c>cg, a true sol-gel transition occurs at a characteristic time tg, i. e. an infinite cluster (self connected through the boundary conditions) appears. In contrast to the diffusion limited cluster-cluster aggregation (DLCA) model, tg does not increase as the box size increases. Comparison between numerical results and measurements of the gelation time of <b>silica</b> <b>gels</b> prepared in <b>container</b> of various sizes suggests that gelation without addition of catalyst (neutrally-reacted) and under base catalyzed conditions corresponds to large and small F, respectively. Moreover, for large F values, we calculate scattering intensity curves for FBA gels and find that they agree with experimental SANS data for neutrally-reacted silica aerogels...|$|R

50|$|<b>Silica</b> <b>gel</b> is most {{commonly}} encountered {{in everyday life}} as beads in a small (typically 2 x 3 cm) paper packet. In this form, it {{is used as a}} desiccant to control local humidity to avoid spoilage or degradation of some goods. Because <b>silica</b> <b>gel</b> can have added chemical indicators (see below) and absorbs moisture very well, <b>silica</b> <b>gel</b> packets usually bear warnings for the user not to eat the contents.|$|R
40|$|Three {{kinds of}} {{commercial}} <b>silica</b> <b>gels</b> with pore size of 2 - 3, 4 - 7 and 8 - 10 nm respectively {{are used for}} preparing composite adsorbents by soaking them into the aqueous solution of calcium chloride. The test result indicates that both the water uptake and adsorption rate of composite adsorbents prepared from 4 - 7 and 8 - 10 nm <b>silica</b> <b>gels</b> improve greatly compared to pure <b>silica</b> <b>gels,</b> {{but they do not}} for 2 - 3 nm <b>silica</b> <b>gels.</b> The <b>silica</b> <b>gel</b> with pore size of 2 - 3 nm is not suitable for preparing the composite adsorbent by impregnation method due to the pore blockage because of the small pore size. The SCP and COP of the adsorption chiller with sample SA 50 are 128. 3 Wkg(- 1) and 0. 27 respectively at the hot source temperature of 90 A degrees C, which are largely superior to that of SA 0. Hence using the composite adsorbent instead of the pure <b>silica</b> <b>gel</b> can reduce the size of the adsorption chiller...|$|R
