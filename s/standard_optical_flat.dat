40|$|Abstract. The {{hydrostatic}} {{seal rings}} {{are one of}} the most important components used in reactor coolant pumps. They are generally made of hard materials such as silicon nitride, alumina, silicon carbide and tungsten carbide. Meanwhile, the form error should be within the length of one to two helium light bands and the surface roughness should be in the scale of nanometers, which make them difficult to machining. In order to solve this problem, a high accuracy grinding method using a large cup wheel had been proposed and the tilt angle of the cup wheel spindle become a crucial factor affecting the ground form errors. This paper addresses a novel method for high-accuracy calibrating the tilt angle of the cup wheel spindle to fit the extremely shallow taper angle of the seal ring conical surface, and the mathematical model is established incorporating a <b>standard</b> <b>optical</b> <b>flat</b> with a high-accuracy laser displacement sensor. The practicability of this method is verified by grinding a seal ring sample with the outer diameter is 200 mm and the taper angle is 700 µrad. It is found that the taper angle error is only 1. 72 µrad and the radical profile error of the conical surface is about 0. 22 µm...|$|E
40|$|The {{calculation}} of uncertainty for a mea-surement {{is an effort}} to set reasonable bounds for the measurement result according to standardized rules. Since every measurement produces only an esti-mate of the answer, the primary requisite of an uncertainty statement is to inform the reader of how sure the writer is that the answer is in a certain range. This report explains how we have implemented these rules for dimensional calibrations of nine different types of gages: gage blocks, gage wires, ring gages, gage balls, round-ness <b>standards,</b> <b>optical</b> <b>flats</b> indexing tables, angle blocks, and sieves. Key words: angle standards; calibration; dimensional metrology; gage blocks; gages; optical flats; uncertainty; uncer-tainty budget...|$|R
40|$|The true contours, {{undistorted}} by gravitational bending, {{were determined}} for four 10 ̂-inch-diameter <b>standard</b> <b>optical</b> <b>flats</b> of fused quartz. The bending deflections of these flats {{were determined by}} a method based upon the differential bending with thickness of the flats. Bending deflection curves of a flat supported ac three points equidistant {{from the center of}} the flat and equidistant from each other were obtained. The locus of the bending deflections at the center of a flat, similarly supported but with supports at different distances from the center, approximates a straight line. This paper describes the method used to obtain the true contours and the bending deflection curves of the flats, and compares the bending values so determined with theoretically derived values. 1...|$|R

40|$|An {{infrared}} wavelength {{variable attenuator}} based on contra-rotating germanium wedges is examined theoretically. The device redirects {{the paths of}} internal reflections associated with an <b>optical</b> <b>flat</b> to avoid closely spaced parallel beams at the output. Complementary wedges separated by an air gap compose an <b>optical</b> <b>flat</b> which, when combined with a masking arrangement, restricts unwanted reflections. A model of the device was built and experimentally evaluated. The results compare favorably with the dynamic range of attenuation of 2 to 50 db from theoretical calculations, and show a substantial reduction in the etalon effect associated with pairs of <b>optical</b> <b>flats...</b>|$|R

Monochromatic light (red) shines through the glass flat and reflects from both the bottom surface of the <b>optical</b> <b>flat</b> and the top surface of the test piece, and the two reflected rays combine and superpose. However the ray reflecting off the bottom surface travels a longer path. The additional path length is equal to twice the gap between the surfaces. In addition the ray reflecting off the bottom surface undergoes a 180° phase reversal, while the internal reflection of the other ray from the underside of the <b>optical</b> <b>flat</b> causes no phase reversal.

40|$|An {{instrument}} for {{the measurement of}} ball diameters in the 0. 5 - 20 mm range in a gauge block interferometer is realized. The measurement principle is that the ball is positioned between an <b>optical</b> <b>flat</b> and a calibrated gauge block. The total length is measured in a gauge block relative to the <b>optical</b> <b>flat</b> and proper measurement of the deformations due to the measuring force. The parallelism is adjusted while viewing the interference patterns on the gauge block and the <b>optical</b> <b>flat.</b> The measuring force can be varied in the 0. 03 - 2. 35 N range. The applied force is calibrated. Experiments show that commonly used formulas to calculate the ball indentation {{as a function of}} the applied force are approximately correct; this instrument however provides a direct means to measure this dependence and to apply a proper extrapolation to zero measuring force. The design is rather compact so it will fit in commonly used gauge block interferometers. The uncertainty which can be achieved is less than 0. 1 micrometer...|$|R

50|$|No {{surface is}} ever {{completely}} flat. Therefore, any errors or irregularities that {{exist on the}} <b>optical</b> <b>flat</b> will affect {{the results of the}} test. <b>Optical</b> <b>flats</b> are extremely sensitive to temperature changes, which can cause temporary surface deviations resulting from uneven thermal expansion. The glass often experiences poor thermal conduction, taking a long time to reach thermal equilibrium. Merely handling the flats can transfer enough heat to offset the results, so glasses such as fused silica or borosilicate are used, which have very low coefficients of themal expansion. The glass needs to be hard and very stable, and is usually very thick to prevent flexing. When measuring on the nanometer scale, the slightest bit of pressure can cause the glass to flex enough to distort the results. Therefore, a very flat and stable work-surface is also needed, on which the test can be performed, preventing both the flat and the test-piece from sagging under their combined weight, Often, a precision-ground marble or stone block is used as a work surface, providing a steady table-top for testing upon. To provide an even flatter surface, sometimes the test may be performed on top of another <b>optical</b> <b>flat,</b> with the test surface sandwiched in the middle.|$|R

50|$|Absolute {{flatness}} is the flatness of {{an object}} when measured against an absolute scale, in which the reference flat (standard) is completely free of irregularities. The flatness of any <b>optical</b> <b>flat</b> is relative to the flatness of the original standard {{that was used to}} calibrate it. Therefore, because both surfaces have some irregularities, there are few ways to know the true, absolute flatness of any <b>optical</b> <b>flat.</b> The only surface that can achieve nearly absolute flatness is a liquid surface, such as mercury, and can sometimes achieve flatness readings to within λ/100, which equates to a deviation of only 6.32 nm (632 nm/100). However, liquid flats are very difficult to use and align properly, so they are typically only used when preparing a standard flat for calibrating other flats.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{a formal}} test to measure wringability. First, the block is {{prepared}} for wringing using the standard process. The block is then slid across a 2 in reference grade ( [...] flatness) quartz <b>optical</b> <b>flat</b> while applying moderate pressure. Then, {{the bottom of the}} gauge block is observed (through the <b>optical</b> <b>flat)</b> for oil or color. For Federal Grades 0.5, 1, and 2 and ISO grades K, 00, and 0 no oil or color should be visible under the gauge block. For Federal Grade 3 and ISO grades 1 and 2, no more than 20% of the surface area should show oil or color. Note that this test is hard to perform on gauge blocks thinner than 0.1 in because they tend not to be flat in the relaxed state.|$|R
50|$|The {{interference}} fringes typically only form {{once the}} <b>optical</b> <b>flat</b> begins to wring to the testing surface. If the surfaces are clean and very flat, they {{will begin to}} wring almost immediately after the first contact. After wringing begins, as air is slowly forced out from between the surfaces, an optical wedge forms between the surfaces. The interference fringes form perpendicular to this wedge. As the air is forced out, the fringes will appear {{to move toward the}} thickest gap, spreading out and becoming wider but fewer. As the air is forced out, the vacuum holding the surfaces together becomes stronger. The <b>optical</b> <b>flat</b> should usually never be allowed to fully wring to the surface, otherwise it can be scratched or even broken when separating them. In some cases, if left for many hours, a block of wood may be needed to knock them loose. Testing flatness with an <b>optical</b> <b>flat</b> is typically done as soon a viable interference pattern develops, and then the surfaces are separated before they can fully wring. Because the angle of the wedge is extremely shallow and the gap extremely small, wringing may take a few hours to complete. Sliding the flat in relation to the surface can speed up wringing, but trying to press the air out will have little effect.|$|R

The telescope efficiency was found to be 0. 0006. The X-ray beam reflected from the twelve <b>optical</b> <b>flat</b> samples was analyzed by means of a long vacuum system of special design for these tests. The scattering then decreased with increasing angle of incidence until a critical angle was passed. At larger angles the scattering increased again. The samples all scattered more at 44 A than at 8 A. Metal samples were found to have about the same scattering at 44 A but greater scattering at 8 A than glass samples...|$|R
