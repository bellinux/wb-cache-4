5|$|In Anglophone countries, Heathen {{groups are}} {{typically}} called kindreds or hearths, or alternately sometimes as fellowships, tribes, or garths. These are small groups, often family units, and usually consist of {{between five and}} fifteen members. They are often bound together by oaths of loyalty, with strict <b>screening</b> <b>procedures</b> regulating the admittance of new members. Prospective members may undergo a probationary period before they are fully accepted and welcomed into the group, while other groups remain closed to all new members. Heathen groups are largely independent and autonomous, although they typically network with other Heathen groups, particularly in their region. There are other followers of the religion who are not affiliated with such groups, operating as solitary practitioners, with these individuals often remaining in contact with other practitioners through social media.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} U.S. {{medical school}} curriculum is four years long. Traditionally, {{the first two}} years are composed mainly of classroom basic science education, while the final two years primarily include rotations in clinical settings where students learn patient care firsthand. Today, clinical education is spread across all four years with the final year containing the most clinical rotation time. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has published mandatory rules, obliging on all inpatient and outpatient teaching settings, laying down the guidelines for what medical students in the United States may do, if they have not completed a clerkship or sub-internship. These rules apply to when they are in the clinical setting in school, not when they are, for example, helping staff events or in other non-formal educational settings, even if they are helping provide certain clinical services along with nurses and the supervising physicians- for example, certain basic <b>screening</b> <b>procedures.</b> In the formal clinical setting in school, they can only assist with certain patient evaluation and management tasks, after the vital signs, chief complaint and the history of present illness have been discerned, but prior to the physical examination: reviewing the patient's signs and symptoms in each body system, and then reviewing the patient's personal medical, genetic, family, educational/occupational, and psychosocial history. The student's supervising physician (or another physician with supervisory privileges if the original doctor is no longer available, for some reason) must be in the room during the student's work, and must conduct this same assessment of the patient before performing the actual physical examination, and after finishing and conferring with the student, will review his or her notes and opinion, editing or correcting them if necessary, and will also have his or her own professional notes; both must then sign and date and I.D. the student's notes and the medical record. They may observe, but not perform, physical examinations, surgeries, endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures, radiological or nuclear medicine procedures, oncology sessions, and obstetrics. The patient must give consent for their presence and participation in his or her care, even at a teaching facility. Depending on the time they have completed in school, their familiarity with the area of medicine and the procedure, and the presence of their supervisor, and any others needed, in the room or nearby, they may be allowed to conduct certain very minor tests associated with the physical examination, such as simple venipuncture blood draws, and electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms, for learning and experience purposes, especially when there is no intern or resident available.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Tobacco {{dependence}} {{among people}} with mental health problems {{is an issue that}} deserves attention both from a clinical and from a public health perspective. Research suggests that Stop Smoking Services often fail to ask clients about underlying mental health problems and thus fail to put in place the treatment adaptations and liaison procedures often required {{to meet the needs of}} clients with a mental health condition who want to stop smoking. This study assesses the recording of mental health problems in a large NHS stop smoking service in England and examines the effect of implementing a short <b>screening</b> <b>procedure</b> on recording mental health conditions. Methods Treatment records from the Stop Smoking Service covering a period of 13 months were audited. The prevalence of reported mental health problems in the six month period before the implementation of the mental health <b>screening</b> <b>procedure</b> was compared with that of the six month period following implementation. The <b>screening</b> <b>procedure</b> was only implemented in the support services directly provided by the Stop Smoking Service. Comparisons were also made with third-party sections of the service where no such <b>screening</b> <b>procedure</b> was introduced. Results The prevalence of reported mental health problems among a total of n = 4999 clients rose from less than 1 % before implementation of the <b>screening</b> <b>procedure</b> to nearly 12 % in the period following implementation, with the change being statistically significant. No significant rise was observed over the same period in the sections of the service where no <b>screening</b> <b>procedure</b> was implemented. Conclusions The absence of standard procedures to record mental health problems among service users in many stop smoking services is currently likely to prevent the detection of co morbidity. Implementing a simple <b>screening</b> <b>procedure</b> appears suitable to increase the routine recording of mental health problems in a stop smoking service, which is an essential step to ensure services can be tailored and delivered appropriately to the client group. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background Several studies {{suggested}} that {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) is largely underdiagnosed {{in patients with}} acute coronary syndrome (ACS) contributing to further affect clinical outcome. Our aim was to validate a <b>screening</b> <b>procedure</b> to identify, in ACS patients, those with negligible risk of undiagnosed COPD. Methods From December 2014 to August 2015, 169 ACS patients with smoking history underwent <b>screening</b> <b>procedure.</b> <b>Screening</b> <b>procedure</b> combined peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR, defined as positive if   19. 5 points). The screening was considered negative if both tests provided negative results, positive if both were positive, uncertain in presence of discrepancy. Spirometry was planned after 2  months to identify or not the presence of irreversible airflow obstruction (undiagnosed COPD). The primary endpoint was the negative predictive value of screening for undiagnosed COPD. Results Overall, 137 (81 %) patients received spirometry (final study population). Screening was negative, uncertain and positive in 58 (42 %), 46 (34 %) and 33 (24 %) patients, respectively. We found undiagnosed COPD in 39 (29 %) patients. Only 3 patients with negative screening showed undiagnosed COPD. Negative screening showed the best ability to discriminate patients without COPD (negative predictive value 95 %). Two-month health status in patients with undiagnosed COPD was significantly poor. Conclusions Undiagnosed COPD is relatively frequent in ACS patients with smoking history and a simple <b>screening</b> <b>procedure</b> including PEFR and RHSQ can be administered before hospital discharge to discriminate those at negligible risk of undiagnosed COPD (ClinicalTrials. gov, NCT 02324660) ...|$|R
