Thus, matter exists for the sake of receiving its form, and an organism has sight for the sake of <b>seeing.</b> <b>Now,</b> each thing has certain potentialities {{as a result of its}} form. Because of its form, a snake has the potential to slither. Hence, we can say that the snake ought to slither. The more a thing achieves its potential, the more it succeeds in achieving its purpose.|$|E
500|$|Prompted by {{the launch}} of and {{misinformation}} about , the US Navy and Congress faced what they perceived as a vastly better battleship than the two [...] battleships then under construction, which were designed under tonnage constraints that Congress had imposed on capital ships. Actually, the South Carolinas were inferior only in speed to Dreadnought; they carried fewer heavy guns but, unlike Dreadnought, could bring {{all of them to}} bear on the broadside. Because of this, they could fire an equal weight of metal. Also, because greater time and care had been taken with their armor and bulkhead arrangement, they were better protected than the British ship. None of this was realized at the time. Nevertheless, the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair (C) had struggled tremendously to design an adequate warship under congressional limits and had taken battleship design as far under those restrictions as it could. <b>Seeing</b> <b>now</b> that those limits had become unrealistic, Congress ended them; any subsequent constraints would be dictated by treaty limitations. The language of the authorizing act of June 26, 1906 was for a battleship [...] "carrying as heavy armor and as a powerful armament as any known vessel of its class, to have the highest practicable speed and the greatest practicable radius of action." ...|$|E

2500|$|Koss concludes that, in a [...] "long, eventful {{and complex}} career, (that) does not admit easily of a summing up, Asquith's failings were no less {{manifest}} than his achievements." [...] Brock maintains that [...] "his peacetime record of legislative achievement {{should not be}} overshadowed by his wartime inadequacy." [...] Of those achievements, his colleague Lord Buckmaster wrote; [...] "The dull senses and heavy lidded eyes of the public prevent them from <b>seeing</b> <b>now</b> all that you have accomplished, but history will record it and the accomplishment is vast." [...] Among his greatest domestic accomplishments, reform of the House of Lords is at the zenith. Yet Asquith's premiership was also marked by many difficulties, leading McKenna to write in his memoirs, [...] "friends began to wonder whether the highest statesmanship consisted of overcoming one crisis by creating another". Hazlehurst, writing in 1970, felt there was still much to be gleaned from a critical review of Asquith's peacetime premiership, [...] "certainly, the record of a prime minister under whom the nation goes {{to the brink of}} civil war [...] must be subjected to the severest scrutiny." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April, {{the sisters}} decided to flat {{together}} but trouble arose with Brooke's flatmate's Bella Cooper (Amelia Reid) and Luke Durville (Gerald Urquhart) refusing to move out. Brooke ended up manipulating the two into relationship problems {{to get them}} out but ultimately helped the two and was at odds with Bree's antagonistic view of the couple. Brooke and Bree's mother Annette (Louise Wallace) returned in July 2012 and the cast enjoyed portraying the relationship between the mother and her illegitimate daughter, with Wallace stating: [...] "It's good looking at the back story and what happened in our relationship and where it all went wrong, why she hates me and why I don't give a rats arse about her. We are deeply flawed." [...] She went on to state that Annette would have never; [...] "anticipated having to deal with this part of her past, so it throws her a real curveball when she arrives and discovers Bree has firmly entrenched herself in Brooke's life" [...] and that; [...] "In some ways, Bree and Annette are more similar than Brooke and Annette, which really riles Annette." [...] Following her lack of respect from Annette, Bree held her captive and mentally tortured her. She decided that life would be easier as Brooke and started to adopt her personality, [...] "All she really wants is acceptance and love and, as we're <b>seeing</b> <b>now,</b> she's finding a way for that to happen by adopting Brooke's persona." [...] The storyline was compared to films: Fatal Attraction and Single White Female, though Blampied tried not to be influenced by them. The storyline climaxed in Bree, under the identity of Brooke, attempting to murder her sister and hiding her body in a storage container. Vinnie realised something was wrong and a search party soon found Brooke. Bree tried to escape but was mown down by a forklift. After finally accepting what she had done was wrong, Bree tried to make up with Brooke but ended up being sectioned to a psychiatric ward.|$|E
