5|$|Meanwhile, Homer, {{with the}} help of Ned Flanders, sets out to rescue the {{children}} (driving Ned's car and sawing off part of his roof to use as a <b>snow</b> <b>plough)</b> but crashes Flanders' car into a fire hydrant, which sprays water that freezes the car in place. Homer's repeated gunning of the accelerator causes carbon monoxide to flood the front of the car. Flanders and Homer get high from the fumes and wildly hallucinate. While the trapped children go wild with power, Skinner uses the school hamster, named Nibbles, to get a message to the outside world. Nibbles makes it to Ned and Homer, breaking the window and reviving them: they crash into a salt silo, melting the snow around the school and badly rusting the car but freeing the kids in the process.|$|E
500|$|In 1944 the {{widening}} of Highway 7 was undertaken. The Elma rural municipality (R.M.) requested that an {{automatic warning system}} should be established at the level crossing of the Canadian National Railway and Highway 7. [...] At this same time, the rural municipality requested that the hills be gravelled which are situated {{on either side of}} Flaxcombe. The third concern in 1948 was to construct an all-weather highway between Kindersley and Alsask, and this too was requested of the Department of Highways (DOH). [...] In 1950, the rates of pay for roadwork were 60 cents an hour for a single labourer, 80 cents an hour for man and two horses, a labourer with four horses would earn C$1.00 per hour and for man with six horses $1.20 per hour [...] In the 1950s the R.M. provided grants to the local <b>snow</b> <b>plough</b> club to keep the highway clear after storms. [...] The 1951 oil strike at Coleville resulted in a Husky service station and bulk plant opening at Flaxcombe on Highway 7 in 1955. [...] It was located on the railroad to facilitate loading crude oil into rail cars. [...] Highway 7 was rebuilt between 1960 and 1961.|$|E

40|$|The Road Condition Model is {{the central}} part of the Winter Model. The reason for this is that it {{produces}} input data for most of the models that describe effects of different kinds, such as accident risks, travel times, fuel consumption and environmental impact. The road condition model supplies a condition assessment for a winter in the form of a road condition description on an hourly basis. According to the requirements of the client, the road condition model is confined to describing road conditions for two-lane roads with oncoming traffic in rural areas. At this stage, the model is also confined to describing road conditions in the traffic lane. No account is thus taken of hard shoulders, if any. The aim of the project is to develop a working prototype to the definite road condition model. The road condition model consists of the following sub models. The first five are related to maintenance measures taken and the last four to traffic and weather. 1. Anti-icing treatment. - 2. <b>Snow</b> <b>ploughing</b> combined with anti-icing treatment. - 3. <b>Snow</b> <b>ploughing.</b> - 4. Gritting. - 5. Grading. - 6.

50|$|Cat's eye, {{invented by}} Percy Shaw in the 1930s, Cat's eyes equip many major routes in the British Isles. They consist of four {{reflective}} lenses mounted in a durable white rubber housing, two facing fore and two facing aft. The housing is mounted within a cast iron shoe, which the rubber housing sinks in to when driven over. This provides protection from <b>snow</b> <b>ploughing</b> {{and allows the}} lenses to be self-cleaning—they pass a rubber blade when depressed. The lenses are available {{in a variety of}} different colours, mainly white, yellow/orange, green, red, and blue.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the maintenance of}} all locomotives, some Bahnbetriebswerke are also responsible for looking after special duty trains. The most important units are breakdown trains (for re-railing derailed rolling stock) and rotary <b>snow</b> <b>ploughs.</b> There are also fire fighting trains to enable fires in the area to be put out as quickly as possible. And for the smooth running of a Bahnbetriebswerk tractors and shunters are needed in order to move wagons and locomotives that are unable to move under their own power. Finally almost every Bahnbetriebswerk has a variety of special vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|The cat's eye design {{originated}} in the UK in 1933 and is today used all over the world. The original form consisted of two pairs of reflective glass spheres set into a white rubber dome, mounted in a cast-iron housing. This is the kind that marks {{the centre of the}} road, with one pair of cat's eyes showing in each direction. A single-ended form has become widely used in other colours at road margins and as lane dividers. Cat's eyes are particularly valuable in fog and are largely resistant to damage from <b>snow</b> <b>ploughs.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of June each year, the line could be reopened. <b>Snow</b> <b>ploughs</b> and blowers needed {{to be used for}} that purpose. On many occasions, the snow depths in the narrow alpine valleys were so great that the snow had to be removed by hand over many shifts, and with heavy {{construction}} equipment, until the FO's snow removal vehicles could be used. The construction equipment had to be transported on open rail wagons to the places where they were required. By these means, the line could be reopened two weeks earlier, but at a high price.|$|R

50|$|Initially {{the railway}} used 30 ft 2-axle coaches, {{by the time}} {{services}} to Sheffield were introduced the company had 4-axle 51 ft composite corridor coaches on bogies. Most of the rolling stock was for freight; in 1923 the company had 4,808 freight wagons of which over 3,000 were open wagons. Additionally the company possessed a <b>snow</b> <b>plough,</b> since the cuttings in the Yorkshire Wolds were prone to drifts when snow occurred.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, {{construction}} {{began on}} new <b>snow</b> <b>ploughs</b> for the DR in East Germany {{as well as}} the conversion of steam locomotives to oil-firing. At the same time the refurbishment of diesel locomotives was taken on. The number of employees hovered around 2,000. In 1961 the former streamliner, 61 002, was converted by the factory into the high-speed, trial locomotive, 18 201, which is still operational today. This engine reached a top speed of 180 km/h and is currently the fastest, operational steam locomotive in the world. In 1981 the construction of fireless locomotives and S-Bahn bogies began, whilst the repair of steam locomotives steadily waned.|$|R

50|$|In the 1940s {{the roads}} that become Secondary Highways were only dirt trails. Farmers {{would have to}} use axes to clear the brush of the boreal forest from the road allowance, and use plows and {{machinery}} pulled by horses to maintain the roads and fill in low spots that filled with water during spring melt and summer rains. These were not all weather roads, there were no <b>snow</b> <b>ploughs</b> to keep the roads clear over the winter months, so in the 1950s the larger farm trucks could only make it through {{a few months of}} the year. By 1957, the road saw an application of gravel to the surface, and was graded. A formal surveying crew came through in 1963 to clear brush and mark the path of the highway which was constructed in 1964.|$|R
