5|$|The {{morning of}} 4 March saw {{the arrival of}} the 2ndSquadron, 7thCavalry, which {{relieved}} the 2ndSquadron, 5thCavalry. The next day Major General Innis P. Swift, the commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, arrived aboard Bush and assumed command. He ordered the 2ndSquadron, 7thCavalry to attack across the native <b>skidway.</b> The 2ndSquadron, 5thCavalry therefore went back into the line to relieve them. While the relief was taking place, the Japanese launched a daylight attack. This was repulsed by the cavalrymen, with the help of artillery and mortar fire, but the American attack was delayed until late afternoon. It then ran into a Japanese minefield and by dawn the advance had only reached as far as the <b>skidway.</b>|$|E
5|$|By dawn, the Japanese attack had subsided. Over 750Japanese {{dead were}} counted {{in and around}} the American positions. No prisoners were taken. American {{casualties}} were 61dead, and 244wounded, including nine dead and 38wounded Seabees. The 2ndSquadron, 5thCavalry and the 40th Naval Construction Battalion received Presidential Unit Citations. General Chase called for an airdrop of ammunition, prodigious quantities of which had been expended during the night, and had Warramunga fire on the native <b>skidway.</b>|$|E
500|$|The largest {{island in}} the group is Manus Island, which is about [...] across {{from east to west}} and [...] wide from north to south. The {{interior}} is mountainous, with peaks rising to [...] and largely covered with thick tropical rainforest. The then largely uncharted coastline has numerous reefs. The shoreline consisted mostly of mangrove swamp. Los Negros is separated from Manus by the narrow Loniu Passage. The island contains two important harbours of its own, Papitai on the west coast, which connects with Seeadler Harbour, and Hyane on the east coast. The two are separated by a [...] wide sandy spit. Here, the natives built a <b>skidway</b> over which they could drag canoes between the two harbours. Los Negros curves horseshoe-like, forming a natural breakwater for Seeadler Harbour, the remainder of which is enclosed by Manus and a series of smaller islands. The main entrance was through a [...] wide passage between Hauwei and Ndrilo Islands. Seeadler Harbour is about [...] across from east to west and [...] wide from north to south, and up to [...] deep.|$|E
60|$|On several {{occasions}} {{we were almost}} checkmated in our efforts to supply and clear {{a way for the}} builders. There was, of course, no lack of timber, but the difficulty was {{to get it out of}} the forest and into position, for we often spent days building <b>skidways</b> or hewing roads to bring the great logs down, after which it cost us even a longer time rigging gear to lower them over dangerous ledges to those who worked below. Still, we made progress, and the free miners or forest ranchers who trudged behind their weary pack-horses down the trail that crossed the track encouraged us in their own fashion, which was at times slightly eccentric; while now and then a party of citizens from the struggling town rode over to inspect the new road they hoped would do so much for them.|$|R
500|$|At 21:00, a lone Japanese plane dropped eight bombs, cutting {{telephone}} wires. Once it had departed, yellow flares {{went up and}} a Japanese infantry {{attack was}} launched, supported by mortar fire. Offshore, Dechaineux' destroyers came under attack from four Betty bombers. 1st Squadron, 5th Cavalry, was attacked by about two reinforced platoons, which were met by heavy automatic weapons and mortar fire. The heavy jungle in this sector permitted some infiltration but the Japanese force was {{not strong enough to}} overrun the position. The main Japanese attack was delivered by 2nd Battalion, 1st Independent Mixed Regiment, {{from the direction of the}} native <b>skidway,</b> together with detachments from the Porlaka area, and fell on 2ndSquadron, 5thCavalry. The troopers noticed a change in Japanese tactics. Instead of infiltrating silently, they advanced across the open, talking and in some cases singing. Their advance took them straight into anti-personnel mines and booby traps, which duly exploded, and then into the fields of fire of the Americans' automatic weapons, including several [...]30 water-cooled Browning machineguns, but the advance continued. The guns of the 211th Coast Artillery (AA) Battalion and 99th Field Artillery Battalion fired through the night, attempting to break up the Japanese attack from Porlaka. Shortly after midnight, Japanese barges attempted to cross Hyane harbour but were engaged by anti-aircraft guns and did not reach the American positions. A Bofors 40mm gun position was captured by the Japanese, who in turn were driven off by the Seabees. Manning the [...]30s, the 5thCavalry's gunners piled up the Japanese dead until the guns had to be moved to get clear fields of fire. One of the Browning guns that held the position was later left in its place, as a monument. Sergeant Troy McGill occupied a revetment with his squad of eight men. All were killed or wounded except McGill and another man, whom he ordered to fall back to the next revetment. McGill fired his rifle until it jammed, then clubbed the Japanese with it until he was killed. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
60|$|After dinner {{they all}} went out to see the crew working. It was the biggest crew {{anywhere}} in the neighborhood. Ridgeley got out and hitched the team to a tree, and took Field up to the <b>skidway.</b> Mrs. Field remained in the sleigh.|$|E
60|$|He {{thought of}} the forty years he had spent here on the homestead--the rude, pioneer days--the house he had built for himself, with its plain furniture, the old-fashioned spinning-wheel on which Anna had spun his trousers, the wooden {{telephone}} and the rude <b>skidway</b> on which he ate his meals.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Harry. [...] "For one thing, it's quite a {{long way}} to the nearest mill and we'd have to build a <b>skidway</b> for a mile or two down to the water. Besides, in a general way, it's only the redwood and red cedar that the mills have much use for." ...|$|E
60|$|After dinner {{they all}} went out to see the crew working. It was the biggest crew {{anywhere}} in the neighborhood, and they sat a long while and watched the men at work. Ridgeley got out and hitched the team to a tree, and took Field up to the <b>skidway.</b> Mrs. Field remained in the sleigh, however.|$|E
60|$|Mist rolled {{among the}} pines {{and it was}} raining hard when Festing led his team down the hill. He wore big rubber boots and slickers, and a heavy log trailed behind the horses through the mud. Some {{distance}} above the river the slope was gradual, and {{it was necessary to}} haul the logs to the <b>skidway</b> he had built. They would then run down without help; indeed, the difficulty was to stop them when they reached the track. Festing was wet and dirty, and the sweating horses were splashed. When he stopped to unhook the chain, three or four men came up with cant-poles, and struggling in the churned-up mire, rolled the log {{to the top of the}} incline.|$|E
60|$|Foster forgot {{himself and}} the others as he continued, for he had a vivid memory of the struggle. He {{took charge of the}} work in the woods, while Lawrence tactfully pressed for payment of {{outstanding}} accounts, put off creditors, and somehow provided money for wages. As extra gangs had to be hired, Foster owned {{that he did not know}} how the thing was done. He cut a grade for the <b>skidway</b> up the hill, slashing tangled bush and blasting rocks, worked in the snow by moonlight long after his men stopped, and afterwards learned that Lawrence often went without a meal when pay-day got near. But they hauled out the logs and the lumber was delivered. When he stopped, Featherstone looked up with some color in his face.|$|E
60|$|Then {{they built}} the sawmill {{with the help}} of Lawrence's check from home, and soon {{afterwards}} met with their worst reverse. They had engaged to supply the Hulton Company with lumber of a certain kind for some special work, and then found that few of the trees they required grew near the river. This meant that a <b>skidway</b> must be made over a very rough hill and a gasolene winding engine bought or hired to haul the logs out of the next valley. There was, however, another fir easily accessible that might suit the purpose, but not quite as well, and Foster related how he and his partner sat up late one night, calculating costs and wondering whether they should pay Hulton a fine to break the bargain. He added naively that they were some time arguing if they should substitute the inferior wood.|$|E
60|$|When supper time drew near, men {{and horses}} were worn out, and Festing {{knew that if}} he urged the former to {{continue}} he could not do much without the teams. There were, however, a few logs he meant to haul to the <b>skidway</b> before he stopped, and he had some misgivings when he started with the last. It was an unusually large trunk, and the tired horses floundered as they tightened the chain. Thawing snow when beaten hard is as slippery as ice, but the animals kept their feet and the mass began to move. Festing got a firm grip on the near horse's bridle and plodded forward cautiously, with the rain in his face when he crossed the openings in the wood. The snow reflected a puzzling glimmer, but the darkness was thick among the trees, and drops from the shaking branches fell into his eyes. Turning his hat-brim down, he felt for the edge of the trail.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our tunnel leads out beside one {{boundary}} of the Day Spring claim. I must explain that of late we found signs that, {{in spite of a}} fault, the best of the reef stretched under adjoining soil, and it was only owing to disagreements with his men, and my refusal, that the Colonel neglected to jump the record of a poor fellow who couldn't put in the legal improvements. He had intended to do so; while I believe the miner, who fell sick, told your uncle. This will make clear a good deal; you should remember it. Well, to work our adit we had to make an ore and dirt dump on adjacent land; and we'd hardly started it than two men began felling timber right across our <b>skidway,</b> until, speaking as if he commanded the universe, the Colonel ordered them off. They didn't go, however; and I really thought he would have a fit when one of them said with a grin, 'Light out of this, and be quick. Don't you know you're trespassing?' ...|$|E

50|$|Turbo Tubing was {{discontinued}} during January 2009. It {{was located}} {{in front of the}} Base Lodge, on The Landing ski trail, and was serviced by the <b>Skidway</b> Chairlift. It operated on select nights such as weekends and holidays. Previously it had been located east of the Whiffletree and featured high-speed tracks with a large hill at the base to slow the tubes. Riders used a handle-tow line which has since been removed. It has since been replaced by Kids Tubing which uses the same tubes but only runs about 300 ft next to the Moosecalator, and is serviced by that lift.|$|E
50|$|Prior to enlisting for {{military}} service, Arthur left school at age 16 {{to work in}} a sawmill in Rusk County, Texas, handling a canthook on the <b>skidway</b> for $1.50 a day. Another early job was pushing a wheelbarrow filled with mortar to help build a brick plant near Garrison, Texas. This job also paid $1.50 a day. This was six-day work, but he had to spend fifty cents a day seven days a week for meals. He then got a job picking cotton for fifty cents per hundred pounds of cotton—with free board. Between his cotton He made enough profit to make a good start toward growing a crop of his own in East Texas. He obtained what schooling he could at various times and places (Farmer).|$|E
50|$|The logs {{were cut}} {{and brought to}} the top of the bluff in the winter by a man and team of horses and then rolled down to the live logs <b>skidway.</b> After the {{economic}} panic of 1893, the town was sold to Martin Valetine who ran the town for a number of years, finally selling it to Isaac and Bill Bonifas and later to Ben Miller. By this time, the timber was nearly gone and Miller dismantled the mill and stored it on the shore for shipment. The only known pirate of the Great Lakes, Dan Seavey, stole all the equipment and sold it. In the early 1900s the town was used as a fishing port but eventually the wharf was washed away and none of the houses remain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As for jacket {{dragging}} load-out foundations, {{the concrete}} <b>skidway</b> blocks were prone to be sheared and wrecked, especially the outer blocks, for they generally swung with the tugboat. This paper takes dragging load-out of LS 36 - 1 jacket on 3 # <b>skidway</b> for example, and proposes a design analysis for dock apron <b>skidway</b> blocks. The design philosophy is replacing original concrete blocks with steel blocks, {{and the new}} steel blocks not only have good shear strength and compressive strength, {{but they are also}} easier to connect and fix with <b>skidway.</b> In addition, some essential strengthen measures are adopted, reformed 3 # <b>skidway</b> blocks are ready for much heavier modules and jackets dragging load-out works...|$|E
