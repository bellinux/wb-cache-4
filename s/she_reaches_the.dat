5|$|A young Serb {{boy from}} the {{vicinity}} of Višegrad is taken from his mother by the Ottomans {{as part of the}} devşirme levy, one of many Christian boys to experience this fate during the Ottoman Empire's 500-year-long occupation of the Balkans. The boy's mother follows her son wailing until <b>she</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> Drina River, where he is taken across by ferry and she can no longer follow. The young boy is converted to Islam and assigned the Turkish name of Mehmed, becoming known as Mehmed-paša Sokolović. He rises through the Ottoman military ranks and around the age of 60 becomes the Grand Vizier, a position he holds for the next fifteen years. During his time as Grand Vizier, he serves under three sultans and oversees the Ottoman Empire's expansion into Central Europe. He remains haunted by the memory of being forcibly taken from his mother and orders the construction of a bridge at the part of the river where the two became separated.|$|E

500|$|Middlesex {{is written}} {{in the form of}} a memoir, and {{switches}} between the first and the thirdperson in several spots. Used as a comedic device, the third person narratives illustrate Cal's estrangement from Calliope: When he refers to her in the third person, he is identifying her as someone other than him. Patricia Chu, a scholar of English literature, noted the effectiveness of this style in the chapter in which the adolescent Callie searches for information on hermaphroditism. As the teenager reads Webster's Dictionary, following the trail of definitions related to her condition, <b>she</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>the</b> entry for hermaphrodite. The narration switches from personal to external, lending poignancy to the character's final discovery as she confronts the word [...] "monster".|$|E

[...] "I didn't know then, what I know now," [...] a loud, robotic voice sings -- well, it's more like it just says the words about two thirds into the song. And that somehow makes it more intense when Namie sings the chorus again and asks [...] "What is life?" ...|$|E
