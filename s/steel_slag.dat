40|$|In both {{laboratory}} and field studies, <b>steel</b> <b>slags</b> {{were found to}} generate exceptionally high levels of alkalinity over extended periods. <b>Steel</b> <b>slags</b> also have high neutralization potentials {{and can be used}} as alkaline amendments to acid-producing materials. This paper discusses the alkalinity-generating capacity of <b>steel</b> <b>slags,</b> their metal leaching potential and applications for acid mine drainage control. Results indicate that <b>steel</b> <b>slags</b> can provide highly concentrated alkaline recharge to acid mine wastes. Proper design and sizing offers the potential for a low- to zero-maintenance method for treating acid mine drainage (AMD) within the spoil pile itself. Since slags form around the melting point of iron,> 2, 700 oF, most compounds which have a low boiling point have been driven off. Most of the residuals are encased as oxides or in a calcium-alumino-silicate glassy matrix. Fortunately, the matrix is soluble and releases calcium and manganese oxides which drive the pH above 10.

He thought that perhaps Alexandria's abundance of limestone to make a rock wool product similar to the steel mineral wool might be something to work on. Hall, using his chemical engineering background, experimented with the bedrock material. He discovered that it had a melting point near that of glass. He played with this molten stone in steel cupola furnaces and drew fibers out of them with blasts of air. The result of this experiment was a wool-like substance {{similar to that of the}} <b>steel</b> <b>slag</b> mineral wool. His product however did not have sulfur in it, which he considered caused the problems with steel mineral wool. He eventually determined that his material was an excellent insulator.

At the time he was manufacturing this insulating material, the chief users of insulation were breweries, distilleries, and cold storage facilities. For their insulation they used cork that was imported from Spain and Portugal. These firms were skeptical of Hall's new insulating material, so he made board-like sheets under the brand name [...] "Rock Cork" [...] to make it more appealing to the market.

40|$|International audienceElectric {{arc furnace}} <b>steel</b> <b>slags</b> (EAF-slags) and {{basic oxygen furnace}} <b>steel</b> <b>slags</b> (BOF-slags) were used to remove {{phosphate}} from synthetic solutions and real wastewater. The main objective {{of this study was}} to establish an overview of the phosphate removal capacities of <b>steel</b> <b>slags</b> produced in Europe. The influences of parameters, including pH, and initial phosphate and calcium concentrations, on phosphate removal were studied in a series of batch experiments. Phosphate removal mechanisms were also investigated via an in-depth study. The maximum capacities of phosphate removal from synthetic solutions ranged from 0. 13 to 0. 28 mg P/g using EAF-slags and from 1. 14 to 2. 49 mg P/g using BOF-slags. Phosphate removal occurred predominantly via the precipitation of Ca-phosphate complexes (most probably hydroxyapatite) according to two consecutive reactive phases: first, dissolution of CaO-slag produced an increase in Ca 2 + and OH- ion concentrations; then the Ca 2 + and OH- ions reacted with the phosphates to form hydroxyapatite. It was found that the release of Ca 2 + from slag was not always enough to enable hydroxyapatite precipitation. However, our results indicated that the Ca 2 + content of wastewater represented a further source of Ca 2 + ions that were available for hydroxyapatite precipitation, thus leading to an increase in phosphate removal efficiencies.

50|$|An {{important}} part of steelmaking is the formation of slag, which floats {{on the surface of}} the molten <b>steel.</b> <b>Slag</b> usually consists of metal oxides, and acts as a destination for oxidised impurities, as a thermal blanket (stopping excessive heat loss) and helping to reduce erosion of the refractory lining. For a furnace with basic refractories, which includes most carbon steel-producing furnaces, the usual slag formers are calcium oxide (CaO, in the form of burnt lime) and magnesium oxide (MgO, in the form of dolomite and magnesite). These slag formers are either charged with the scrap, or blown into the furnace during meltdown. Another major component of EAF slag is iron oxide from steel combusting with the injected oxygen. Later in the heat, carbon (in the form of coke or coal) is injected into this slag layer, reacting with the iron oxide to form metallic iron and carbon monoxide gas, which then causes the slag to foam, allowing greater thermal efficiency, and better arc stability and electrical efficiency. The slag blanket also covers the arcs, preventing damage to the furnace roof and sidewalls from radiant heat.|$|E

Neutralising agent is required to neutralise the acid produced during the biooxidation. Possibilities to replace conventionally used limestone with by-products based on their neutralising capacities and possible harmful effects were investigated. Ten different by-products were used with reference to slaked lime. Batch bioleaching of a pyrite concentrate were conducted in 1 -L reactor using mesophilic microorganisms at 35 º C. The by-products used were different types of <b>steel</b> <b>slags,</b> ashes, dust and mesalime.

The amount of <b>steel</b> <b>slags,</b> EAF dust, Mesalime and Bioash needed for neutralisation ranged from 16 - 37 g, Waste ash and Coal & Tyres ash needed 81 g and 57 g, respectively, while the slaked lime reference needed 22 g. The experiment with Waste ash gave the lowest pyrite oxidation of 59 %, while the other by-products had similar or better pyrite oxidation compared to slaked lime, ranging from 69 - 80 %. Fluoride, chromium and vanadium were potentially toxic elements present in some of the by-products, but had no negative impact on the bacterial activity. A chloride concentration of 11 %, eventually together with other potentially toxic elements, in the Waste ash caused a negative effect, observed by low redox potential and pyrite oxidation.

A special emphasis is made in terms of elastic modulus, comparing the two ISACs, with two standard base course materials (granite and limestone aggregates). The laboratory results show that the ISACs could be used in transportation infrastructures. It was also exper- imentally observed that the two ISACs have better mechanical properties than the standard unbound granular base course materials.

The testing was performed on high-performance bituminous mixtures, including polymer modified base-binder and wearing course asphalt concretes, stone mastic asphalt and porous asphalt. The course aggregate grading of all the mixtures contains Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) <b>steel</b> <b>slags,</b> up to a maximum content of 45...|$|R
