The study was {{released}} on May 25, 2007 and emphasized that this generation's men made less (by 12%) than their fathers had at that same age in 1974, thus reversing a historical trend. It concluded that per year increases in household income generated by fathers/sons have slowed (from an average of 0.9% to 0.3%), barely keeping pace with inflation. [...] "Family incomes have risen though (over the period 1947 to 2005) because more women have gone to work, supporting the incomes of men, by adding a <b>second</b> <b>earner</b> to the family. And as with male income, the trend is downward".|$|E

30|$|We {{define the}} <b>second</b> <b>earner</b> of a {{household}} as the worker {{with the second}} highest income in the family 10. Generally, in a married couple, the husband {{is considered to be}} the first earner who participates in the labor market with certainty. The wife is the <b>second</b> <b>earner.</b> Her decision to participate depends on several economic and non economic variables 11. In particular, it depends on the fraction of her expected gross income that will be disposable, net of total taxes. To understand the impact of taxes on the decision to work, we make use of the concept of the <b>second</b> <b>earner</b> tax rate, a tax rate on labor force participation, as in Eissa et al. (2005).|$|E

They are particularly effective in achieving both goals, labor market participation and poverty alleviation, for single workers (according to Brewer et al., 2006, the WFTC increased labor supply of single mothers by around 5.1 percentage points).

30|$|The {{combination}} of these elements raises the tax burden, especially on two-earner households, generating disincentives {{to participate in the}} labor force for married women who are typically the <b>second</b> <b>earner</b> of the family. Such disincentives are stronger when the first earner’s income is low. More specifically, the incidence of tax credits and universal cash transfers on the <b>second</b> <b>earner</b> tax rate decreases in total income, providing incentives to participate that are higher for richer households 1. Concretely, the <b>second</b> <b>earner</b> tax rate reaches a maximum at low levels of husbands’ yearly earnings, namely 8, 000 euros for childless couples, and 19, 000 euros for couples with children. The overall effect of this design is that earnings of married women decrease the amount of transfers received by the households when they enter the labor market, primarily discouraging participation, but also part-time and low skill jobs 2.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade a number of countries, notably the USA, the UK and Australia, have {{introduced}} new tax and welfare programs, or expanded existing programs, that {{have the effect of}} raising tax rates on the income of the <b>second</b> <b>earner</b> in the family. Examples include {{the earned income tax credit}} (EITC) program in the USA, 1 the child tax credit (CTC) and working tax credit (WTC) programs in the UK, and the Family Tax Benefit (FTB) system in Australia. Since the <b>second</b> <b>earner</b> is typically the female partner, these programs also have the effect of increasing the net-of-tax gender wage gap. Many of the same countries have poorly developed, highcost child care sectors, and so reducing the net wage of the <b>second</b> <b>earner</b> can make child care unaffordable from her net earnings. In a recent paper (Apps 2006 a), I referred to this phenomenon as the ‘new discrimination’. Unlike the ‘old discrimination’, which took the form of lower gross wage rates and poorer opportunities for women in the labour market, the new discrimination is located in government policy. This paper investigates the extent to which the <b>second</b> <b>earner</b> in Australian families has become subject to this new discrimination. The analysis compares effective tax rates on primary and second incomes and identifies the changes introduced in the 2006 – 07 Budget. A key finding of the study is that second earners in families on less than average wages now face the highest average tax rates in the economy. This outcome is identified as a consequence of a series of changes in four key policy instruments used by government to set tax rates on family incomes: the personal income tax schedule, Family Tax Benefits, the Medicare Levy and the low income tax offset...|$|E

On the other hand, while having smaller effects, low-wage subsidies do not create disincentives to <b>second</b> <b>earners,</b> but rather improve the employment incentives of both married and single women 120.|$|R

40|$|The Government has set ambitious {{targets for}} {{reducing}} the number of children grwing up in poverty and has pledged to eradicate child poverty by 2020. Its latest plans for doing this are set out in the March 2008 publication Ending child poverty: everybody's business (HM Treasury, 2008 a). Taken together, there are 900, 000 children in poverty from two-parent families where one adult works full- or part-time, and the other does not work at all. this accounts for 33 per cent of children in poverty. The evidence suggests that these figures could be reduced by encouraging potential <b>second</b> <b>earners</b> into work; within couple families where one parent works full-time and the other does not work, 20 per cent of children are in poverty. Where the second parent work part-time the proportion drops to three percent, and two percent if both parents work full-time (DWP, 2008). Ending child poverty: everybody's business acknowledges the importance of tackling in-work poverty, through encouraging potential <b>second</b> <b>earners</b> in couple families into work where appropriate, and by ensuring that all parents have the support they need to stay in work and progress to higher paid jobs through training and development. This research was designed to improve understanding about two-parent families with children living in poverty where only one parent works, and to focus particularly on the work decisions of the non-working parent...|$|R

40|$|In all {{countries}} {{that use the}} individual as the basic unit of taxation, tax policy makers must contend {{with the problem of}} spousal income splitting and the dilemma it poses for gender equality. On the one hand income splitting opens a back door to joint taxation of couples, with its troubling labour market disincentives for <b>second</b> <b>earners.</b> Yet attempting to prevent this type of avoidance planning by ignoring inter-spousal transfers for tax purposes disrespects women’s individual agency over property to which they hold legal title, and may close off one source of economic power for those who do the bulk of unpaid work. This tax policy issue thus engages fundamental, normative debates about the meaning of gender equality and whether it is possible to enhance women’s access to markets while also valuing and compensating their unpaid contributions. The paper argues that a way through this dilemma is to differentiate between forms of income splitting that enhance the economic autonomy of a lower-earning spouse and those that entail no meaningful sharing of economic power but merely reduce tax for the transferor. While the former should be aggressively constrained, a gender-equality case can be made for more liberal treatment of genuine intra-household transfers, if combined with other measures that reduce the costs to <b>second</b> <b>earners</b> of entering paid labour. The paper criticizes recent Canadian reforms that expand the scope for notional income splitting, without demanding any real redistribution of underlying assets or income...|$|R
40|$|Over recent decades, Australia's highly progressive, individual-based {{taxation}} {{of families}} {{has been replaced}} by a system that tends towards joint taxation with an inverted U-shaped rate scale. The reform has been implemented by introducing family-income-targeted child payments (now Family Tax Benefit Part A) and by lowering tax rates on higher incomes. The new system has shifted the burden of taxation to two-earner families on low and average wages and, in particular, to working married mothers as <b>second</b> <b>earners.</b> For reasons of fairness and efficiency, we propose returning to more progressive individual taxation and universal family payments.

30|$|We {{show that}} the models match {{the low level of}} the Italian labor force {{participation}} and employment rates and replicates the positive correlation between wife’s participation rate and husband’s yearly income. Moreover, we {{show that the}} Italian individual taxation system generates disincentives for women’s labor supply, especially when married with children. This is due to a set of tax credits for dependent spouses and children, universal cash transfers for children that increase the fiscal burden of low-income households, and the <b>second</b> <b>earner</b> tax rate of women married to low-income or unemployed men.|$|E
30|$|In summary, the Italian tax system, even if {{based on}} {{individuals}} {{and not on}} households, generates a set of negative incentives to female labor force participation. This is due to universal cash transfers and tax credits for dependent children and spouses that increase the <b>second</b> <b>earner</b> tax rate of married relative to unmarried women. The distortion is increasing {{with the number of}} children and reaches a maximum at a level of husband’s gross yearly earnings of about 8, 000 euros for childless couples and 19, 000 euros for couples with children.|$|E

After that point, both incomes are taxed and the SET increases to about 20 percent.

In all cases, the labor supply effect is very moderate.
