5|$|After much speculation, {{head coach}} Phil Jackson {{returned}} for the 2010–11 season. In the playoffs, the Lakers defeated the New Orleans Hornets {{in the first}} round. But their opportunity for a three-peat was denied by the Dallas Mavericks in a four-game <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> the second round. After the season, {{it was announced that}} Jackson will not be returning to coach the Lakers.|$|E
5|$|Ponsford {{had less}} success against the South Africans during their tour of Australia in 1931–32. While the Australians took a clean <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> the Test 5–0, Ponsford's highest {{score in the}} four Tests he played was 34; he totalled 97 runs {{at an average of}} 19.40.

5|$|At 3:34p.m., after a <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> Founders Library was {{conducted}} and officers determined that Neptune and DuSable were not shooting sites, they declared the area safe. Police officers established a reception area {{for law enforcement}} personnel at Wirtz Hall, and an investigative command center at Holmes Student Center. By 4:00p.m. CST, school officials announced {{that there was no}} further danger. They said that counselors would be made available in all residence halls.|$|E
5|$|Australia's strongest ever {{performance}} in swimming {{was at the}} 1956 Olympics on home soil in Melbourne. Australia claimed eight of the thirteen gold medals available, including both relays and a clean <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> the medals in the 100m freestyle, considered the blue-riband event {{for both men and}} women. This is the only time that Australia has topped the medal tally in swimming, and the tally of gold medals has not been surpassed despite the expansion of the swimming program to its current 32 events.|$|E

5|$|Barton Fink premiered in May 1991 at the Cannes Film Festival. Beating {{competition}} {{which included}} Jacques Rivette's La Belle Noiseuse, Spike Lee's Jungle Fever, and David Mamet's Homicide, the Coen brothers' film won three awards: Best Director, Best Actor, {{and the top}} prize Palme d'Or. This <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> awards in major categories at Cannes was extremely rare, and some critics felt the jury was too generous {{to the exclusion of}} other worthy entries. Worried that the triple victory could set a precedent which would undervalue other films, Cannes decided after the 1991 festival to limit each movie to a maximum of two awards.|$|E
5|$|Bolt won a third {{consecutive}} world relay {{gold medal in}} the 4 × 100 metres relay final, which made him the most successful athlete in the 30-year history of the world championships. The Jamaican team, featuring four of the top five from the 100m final were comfortable winners with Bolt reaching the finish line on his anchor leg three tenths of a second ahead of the American team anchored by Gatlin. Bolt's performances were matched on the women's side by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, meaning Jamaica took a complete <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> the sprint medals at the 2013 World Championships.|$|E
5|$|Despite not testing {{positive}} {{during the race}} or season, the Gewiss-Ballan team has since been speculated to have executed a systematic doping program that utilized EPO throughout the 1994 season. The team achieved several victories in stage races and one-day races during the year, including a <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> the podium at La Flèche Wallonne weeks {{before the start of}} the Giro. Team doctor Michele Ferrari was banned for life from sports in 2012 by United States Anti-Doping Agency for distribution of performance-enhancing drugs to several of his clients.|$|E

This made him the second man to win all three events at the same World Championships, after Maurice Greene (Usain Bolt duplicated the feat two years later). Gay is a four-time U.S. champion in the 100m.|$|E
5|$|On 11 January 1916, Admiral Reinhard Scheer {{replaced}} von Pohl, who {{was suffering}} from liver cancer. A week later on the 18th, Scheer hoisted his flag aboard Friedrich der Grosse. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. The first of Scheer's operations was conducted the following month, on 5–7 March, with an uneventful <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> the Hoofden. On 25–26 March, Scheer attempted to attack British forces that had raided Tondern, but failed to locate them. Another advance to Horns Reef followed on 21–22 April.|$|E
5|$|The Giants, Philadelphia Eagles, Los Angeles Rams (NFC West), and New Orleans Saints (NFC West) {{finished}} the 1988 season with identical 10–6 records. Philadelphia {{was awarded the}} NFC East title due to a head-to-head <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> the Giants in regular season play, while Los Angeles was awarded a wild card berth based on winning percentage in NFC play. The Giants and Saints did not qualify for the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Fleet {{conducted}} another fruitless <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> the North Sea in late December and, {{while trying}} to enter Scapa Flow in a Force 8 gale and minimal visibility, Monarch was accidentally rammed by Conqueror on 27 December. The former had to unexpectedly manoeuvre to avoid a guardship at the entrance and Conqueror could not avoid her. Monarch suffered moderate damage to her stern and received temporary repairs at Scapa before proceeding to Devonport for full repairs on 4 January 1915, rejoining the Grand Fleet on 20 January.|$|E
5|$|The Queensland Rams {{were the}} first team to be {{eliminated}} from contention for the finals, after being swept four games to nil by the Victoria Aces in round 8. The following round saw South Australia clinch a position in the finals, despite finishing the round in second position. It was not until the final round that the last two spots in the finals were decided: the Aces clinched top spot by sweeping the Perth Heat, which combined with the New South Wales Patriots <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> the Rams eliminated Perth from contention and secured the last finals spot for the Patriots.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodesian Bush War (or Second Chimurenga), {{which had}} been {{underway}} at a low level since before UDI, began in earnest in December 1972 when ZANLA attacked farms in north-eastern Rhodesia. The Rhodesian Security Forces mounted a strong counter-campaign {{over the next two}} years. Muzorewa re-engaged with Smith in August 1973, accepting the 1971–72 Douglas-Home terms, and the two signed a statement to that effect on 17 August. The UANC executive repudiated this in May 1974, but talks between Smith and Muzorewa continued sporadically. The RF again won a clean <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> the 50 white seats in the July 1974 general election.|$|E

5|$|The XF4H-1 was {{designed}} to carry four semi-recessed AAM-N-6 Sparrow III radar-guided missiles, and to be powered by two J79-GE-8 engines. As in the McDonnell F-101 Voodoo, the engines sat low in the fuselage to maximize internal fuel capacity and ingested air through fixed geometry intakes. The thin-section wing had a leading edge <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> 45° and was equipped with blown flaps for better low-speed handling.|$|E
5|$|Another {{adaptation}} {{of a classic}} European theatrical work followed almost immediately, with production of The Lower Depths, based on a play by Maxim Gorky, taking place in May and June 1957. In contrast to the Shakespearean <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> Throne of Blood, The Lower Depths was shot on only two confined sets, in order to emphasize the restricted nature of the characters' lives. Though faithful to the play, this {{adaptation of}} Russian material to a completely Japanese setting—in this case, the late Edo period—unlike his earlier The Idiot, was regarded as artistically successful. The film premiered in September 1957, receiving a mixed response {{similar to that of}} Throne of Blood. However, some critics rank it among the director's most underrated works.|$|E
5|$|Between March and June 1944 Raithel {{commanded}} his regiment during {{several major}} operations, including {{what may have}} been the largest anti-Partisan <b>sweep</b> <b>of</b> the war, Operation Maibaum (Maypole). He was promoted to SS-Standartenführer (colonel) on 1 April 1944. Raithel led his regiment well, resulting in a serious wound in June 1944. On 11 June 1944, he was recommended for an award of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross citing his leadership and courage while commanding the regiment, but it was not approved. While it achieved successes and proved itself competent in counter-insurgency operations against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia between March and August 1944, the 13th SS Division earned a reputation for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb civilians in the security zone.|$|E
