50|$|Sodium pareth sulfate is a {{surfactant}} {{found in}} some detergent products such as hand or body washes, but not as commonly as other chemicals such as <b>sodium</b> <b>laureth</b> <b>sulfate.</b> It is produced similarly to <b>sodium</b> <b>laureth</b> <b>sulfate</b> starting from synthetic fatty alcohols with 12 to 13 carbon atoms.|$|E
50|$|A common {{example is}} sodium lauryl sulfate, with the formula CH3(CH2)11OSO3Na.

40|$|Poor soil {{physical}} properties that limit water movement, root development, and soil aeration are believed {{by many to}} be a continuing barrier to increased crop yields. Soil conditioners supposedly modify the soil environment providing benefits such as improved water infiltration, decreased soil compaction, improved soil structure, and improved crop yields. This study was undertaken {{to determine the effects of}} a soil conditioner, ammonium <b>laureth</b> <b>sulfate,</b> and two levels of vehicle compaction on several of these properties. There were no statistically significant effects of ammonium <b>laureth</b> <b>sulfate</b> on soil water infiltration, soil penetration resistance, soil bulk density, soil water content, nor crop yields. Additionally, there were no interaction effects of the soil conditioner with the level of compaction caused by vehicular traffic. However, increased trafficking did cause increased soil compaction with resultant significant effects on penetration resistance, soil bulk density, soil water content, and soil water infiltration. For the short term, there seems to be no benefit associated with using the ammonium <b>laureth</b> <b>sulfate</b> conditioner. Studies of the longer-term effects of this conditioner on soil properties and yields for various locations and soils may be warranted. Presently, farmers are advised to concentrate on more traditional methods of maintaining a favorable soil environment for crop growth. Soil compaction can result because of vehicular traffic, and farmers should be aware of the possible detrimental effects on soil {{physical properties}} and resultant yields...|$|R

40|$|Light-scattering techniques, {{supplemented}} by radiotracer studies, {{have been used}} in this work to demon-strate formation on hair surfaces of insoluble complexes between some common cationic conditioner actives and anionic lauryl and <b>laureth</b> <b>sulfates.</b> These complexes, which were found to be very dulling and resistant to cleaning by C 12 -based etergents, were shown to form in tress treatments and also in treatments of full heads of hair.

In experiments with conditioner actives, contributions to buildup were found from both conditioner and detergent deposition. In the case of commercial conditioners, buildup was observed only as a result of excess detergent deposition in the presence of conditioner.

40|$|A novel {{analytical}} {{sensing system}} has been designed for the characterization and discrimination of different detergents in water. This micro-sensor system could {{play a key role}} in the development of more efficient and environmentally-friendly washing machines by enabling the measurement of residual detergents. The sensing system comprises a dual shear-horizontal surface acoustic wave (SH-SAW) resonator sensor housed within a poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic chamber. Free and electrically shorted SAW designs were used to analyze synthetic samples of liquid detergents with varying concentrations. Two anionic surfactants, namely sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate and <b>sodium</b> <b>laureth</b> sulphate, and one non-ionic surfactant, polyoxyethylene (9. 5) t-octylphenol have been studied. Dilution tests have been performed in order to determine the sensitivity or detection limit of this liquid sensing system and have been found to be ca. 10 ppm. The SAW based sensor system correctly classified all three detergents through the use of the transient signal response. Because the sensor operates without the need for a selective chemical or biological coating, it should be both robust and reliable. We believe that such technology could be used to make environmentally-friendly and greener washing machines by minimizing the use of detergents and hot water...|$|R

50|$|One {{reason is}} {{concern about the}} effect of {{ingredients}} typically found in commercial hair care products. Shampoo typically contains chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate and <b>sodium</b> <b>laureth</b> <b>sulfate.,</b> which can irritate sensitive skin or if not thoroughly rinsed. Such chemical additives are also believed by some consumers to dry out their hair. The controversial Environmental Working Group compared the ingredients in 42,000 personal care products against 50 toxicity and regulatory databases and found that most shampoos have at least one chemical that raises concern (although the hair care industry counters by claiming that the chemicals are safe in the concentrations used). The group flagged the following groups of ingredients as hazardous: fragrances, due to containing unknown constituents, parabens, possibly linked to endocrine disruption and neurotoxicity, DMDM hydantoin, due to possible allergy concerns, and 1,4-dioxane, which the Environmental Protection Agency has labelled as a probable human carcinogen.|$|E
40|$|The {{detergency}} {{of three}} surfactants, <b>sodium</b> <b>laureth</b> 2 -sulfate (SLES- 2), ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS), and sodium octeth- 1 /deceth-! sulfate (SODS-I), was measured; variables examined were soil/wash cycles plus sebum component vs total sebum removal. After one soil/wash cycle SLES- 2 cleans all sebum compo-nents from hair equally well (> 90 %). ALS {{is not as}} good, and SODS-! is poor for all fractions. With extended use (ten-cycle data), SLES- 2 remains superior for all components (> 90 % removed), but the behavior of ALS and SODS- 1 are substantially different from their one-cycle behaviors. Analysis of tresses washed with ALS under test and simulated use conditions uggests a build-up of fatty acid components on hair; this is interpreted {{in terms of a}} hard water ion/fatty acid interaction. Extended use data of SODS- 1 show increased removal for all components when compared to the one-cycle data, suggesting either a soil release mechanism or inhibition of soiling. We hypothesize that a technique that provides a rapid assessment of total sebum removed from hair by a detergent can be used to screen surfactants. However, to model extended use behavior, it is useful to monitor the removal of sebum components...|$|R
40|$|Polymer–surfactant {{mixtures}} {{are found}} in many industrial formulations, and hence {{there is a significant}} interest in understanding, at a molecular level, how the self-assembly of surfactant is affected by oppositely-charged polyelectrolytes (PEs). We use self-consistent field modeling and show that the modes of interaction of PEs strongly depend on the architecture of the PE on the segmental level. Hydrophilic cationic PEs with their charge proximal to the linear backbone are expected to bind electrostatically to the outsides of the coronas of the spherical micelles of anionic surfactants, such as <b>sodium</b> <b>laureth</b> sulphate (SLES). As a result, the surfactant aggregation number increases, {{but at the same time}} the colloidal stability deteriorates, due to bridging of the PEs between micelles. PEs with their charge somewhat displaced from the backbone by way of short hydrophobic spacers, are expected to be present inside a micelle at the core–corona boundary. In this case the aggregation number decreases, yet the colloidal stability is retained. Hence, SLES tends to remove hydrophilic PEs from an aqueous solution, whereas it solubilizes more hydrophobic ones. The binding isotherm shows that the uptake of PEs remains typically below charge compensation and in this case the spherical micelle topology remains the preferred state...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} protocol is described {{for the assessment}} of relative shampoo detergency on hair by which raw materials, prototype formulations, and competitive products can be objectively contrasted. Hair tresses are soiled with a standard nine-component synthetic sebum mixture using 2 % and 10 % sebum in hexane solutions. Soil removal is determined under three test conditions: bulk bath washer, traditional "finger squeeze, " and controlled-pressure apparatus. Gas chromatography of the residual sebum components erves as the analytical basis for the investigations. Comparisons are based upon the "tracking " of 20 gas chro-matograph peaks which are indicative of the various sebum fractions. An internal control sample is used to compensate for any sample-to-sample variation in soiling level.

The potential for aspiration of aqueous foam during its use and the resulting adverse effects associated with complete immersion in aqueous foam is of major concern to the NIJ when examining the effectiveness and safety of using this technology as a Less-Than-Lethal weapon. This preliminary study was designed to evaluate the maximum quantity of foam that might be aspirated by an individual following total immersion in an SNL-developed aqueous foam. A. T. W.

Although the natural instinct of an individual immersed in foam is to cover their nose and mouth with a hand or cloth, thus breaking the bubbles and decreasing the potential for aspiration, this study was performed to examine a worst case scenario where mouth breathing only was examined, and no attempt was made to block foam entry into the breathing port. Two breathing rates were examined: one that simulated a sedentary individual with a mean breathing rate of 6. 27 breaths/minute, and one that simulated an agitated or heavily breathing individual with a mean breathing rate of 23. 7 breaths/minute.

METHODS: Two long term in vivo studies were carried out on nine healthy Caucasian volunteers mean age 4012 years to evaluate the protecting and repairing effects of the two different barrier repair cosmetic formulations. The application of the formulations was repeated once a day during 7 days and biophysical parameters (TEWL and Skin Hydration) were measured before and after <b>Sodium</b> <b>laureth</b> sulphate exposure The in vitro study was carried out by freeze substitution transmission electron microscopy (FSTEM) on stratum corneum samples obtained by sections of fresh skin from young pigs, depleted with a solvent mixture and treated with the two products RESULTS: The in vivo results demonstrated that daily product application provided a reinforcement of the skin barrier with protecting and repairing effects from chemical injuries the extent of which was dependent on the formulation features (product A>product B) The role of the technical form on the lipid availability was confirmed by the in vitro evaluation tests.

40|$|Aqueous foams are {{aggregates}} {{of bubbles}} mechanically generated by passing air or other gases through a net, screen, or other porous medium that is wetted by an aqueous solution of surface-active foaming agents (surfactants).

An aqueous foam is currently being developed and evaluated by Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) as a Less-Than-Lethal Weapon for the National Institute of Justice (NIJ). The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the toxicity of the aqueous foam developed for the NIJ and to determine whether there are any significant adverse health effects associated with completely immersing individuals without protective equipment in the foam. The toxicity of the aqueous foam formulation developed for NIJ is determined by evaluating the toxicity of the individual components of the foam. The foam is made from a 2 [...] 5 % solution of Steol CA- 330 surfactant in water generated at expansion ratios ranging from 500 : 1 to 1000 : 1. SteoI CA- 330 is a 35 % ammonium <b>laureth</b> <b>sulfate</b> in water and is produced by Stepan Chemical Company and containing trace amounts (< 0. 1 %) of 1, 4 -dioxane. The results of this study indicate that Steol CA- 330 is a non-toxic, mildly irritating, surfactant that is used extensively in the cosmetics industry for hair care and bath products. Inhalation or dermal exposure to this material in aqueous foam is not expected to produce significant irritation or systemic toxicity to exposed individuals, even after prolonged exposure. The amount of 1, 4 -dioxane in the surfactant, and subsequently in the foam, is negligible and therefore, the toxicity associated with dioxane exposure is not significant.

40|$|Goat milk is {{primarily}} {{destined for the}} production of fermented products, in particular cheese. Therefore, the control of antibiotic residues in milk is of great importance, since these could have negative repercussions on technological properties of the milk {{as well as on the}} health of consumers. In milk quality control programs, microbial inhibitor tests are widely applied to detect antibiotics during the screening stage. However, tests are non-specific and may be affected by substances other than antimicrobials which could inhibit the growth of the test micro-organism, causing false positive results. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the interference, related to the presence of different contaminants in goat milk, on the response of microbial inhibitor tests commonly used in Spain to detect antibiotics (BRT MRL, Delvotest SP-NT MCS and Eclipse 100 tests). The influence of the physicochemical characteristics of goat milk on the false positive outcomes in microbial screening tests was also investigated. The suitability of microbial inhibitor tests for screening antibiotics in colostrum secretions was studied by analysing antibiotic-free colostrum and milk samples from forty-three Murciano-Granadina goats, collected every 12 hours during the first week post-partum. Microbial inhibitor tests were not suitable for the analysis of goat colostrum because they presented a high percentage of doubtful and positive results (up 37. 2 % in the 36 hours after partum). To evaluate the effect of caprine colostrum on the microbial test response, antimicrobial-free goat milk spiked with different concentrations of colostrum was analysed to calculate the inhibitory concentrations producing 5 % of positive results. The highest interferences were obtained for the addition of colostrum from 12 to 24 hours post-partum and the colostrum concentrations producing 5 % positive results were between 5. 1 and 34. 6 %. The BRT MRL was the test the most affected. In another study, the interference of detergents and disinfectants used for the cleaning of milking equipment and milk storage tanks of dairy farms was investigated. Antimicrobial-free goat milk was spiked with eight concentrations of different cleaning products (5 acid, 5 alkaline, 5 domestic washing-up liquids, and 1 disinfectant) and analysed using microbial screening tests. The presence of acid detergent and disinfectant based on sodium hypochlorite in goat milk did not affect the microbial test response. However, alkaline detergents at concentrations ≥ 1 ml/l could lead to false positive results in microbial inhibitor tests (up to 16. 7 %) and from 4 ml/l on 100 % positive results were obtained. Regarding the products used for home use, and those used on farms and small size dairies, washing-up liquid containing <b>sodium</b> <b>laureth</b> sulphate and ethanol had the greatest effects on microbial inhibitor tests, even starting from a relatively low concentration (1 ml/l). On the other hand, the presence of a relatively low concentration of detergents in goat milk (0. 5 ml/l) slightly modified the detection capability of the microbial inhibitor tests for amoxicillin, ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, and cloxacillin, although the detection of these drugs at MRL (safe level) was not compromised. Antiparasitic agent residues in goat milk could be another possible cause of false positive results in microbial screening tests. An in vitro study to evaluate the effect of seven parasiticides commonly used in dairy goats was carried out. Further two studies, where albendazole and ivermectin were applied to two groups of dairy goats in lactation were performed. It should be noted that the parasiticide ivermectin is banned for the treatment of animals producing milk for human consumption, although its inclusion in this study was considered interesting to understand the potential effect of their residues in milk, in the event the practice was performed illegally. In the in vitro study, raw antibiotic-free milk from goats was spiked individually with eight different concentrations of albendazole, closantel, diclazuril, febendazole, levamisole, diazinon, and ivermectin. The microbial inhibitor test results showed a great variability according to the test and the drug under study. Of the tests considered, the BRT MRL test was the most sensitive to antiparasitic agents, with the lowest concentrations of antiparasitic agent causing 5, 10, and 50 % of positive results. Generally, closantel and diazinon were the antiparasitic agents that produced higher interferences in all tests, since low concentrations already resulted in positive results, while only higher concentrations of diclazuril and ivermectin showed an inhibitory effect. To evaluate the effect of albendazole residues on the microbial inhibitor test response, eighteen healthy Murciano-Granadina goats in mid-lactation were treated with a single oral administration of the commercially available albendazole registered for dairy sheep (7. 5 mg/kg b. w. of active compound) with a withdrawal period of 4 days for milk production in ovine. Albendazole and its metabolite residues in goat milk after under cascade treatment were not detected above MRL from the third day post-administration. However, a high occurrence of non-compliant results was obtained for the BRT MRL test during the first six days after treatment, suggesting that factors related to the albendazole application other than the drug concentration are able to affect the microbial inhibitor test response in some cases. Regarding the ivermectin study, twenty-eight Murciano-Granadina goats infested with Sarcoptes scabiei var. caprae were treated with a subcutaneous injection of ivermectin (200 μg/kg b. w.), with a second dose applied seven days after the first treatment. Drug residues in goat milk were recorded during the first fifteen days of the experiment with concentrations ranging from 8. 13 to 24. 25 ng/ml. In addition, all the microbial screening tests seem to be affected by the ivermectin treatment, with BRT MRL the most affected (20 %) compared with Delvotest SP-NT MCS and Eclipse 100 (6. 6 and 5. 7 %, respectively). These positive results cannot be associated with the ivermectin concentration in goat milk, as the concentrations measured were lower than the inhibitory concentrations as reported in a previous in vitro study for these microbial tests. Thus, as suggested by some authors, interferences could be related to changes or alterations caused by the application of the parasiticide agent or by the parasitic disease itself, which could affect the immune response of the animals favouring the presence of inhibitory substances in milk. The study of the effect of the goat milk composition on the specificity (rate of false positive results) of microbial inhibitor tests for screening antibiotics was also considered. Thus, individual goat milk samples (n= 200) were analysed by microbial inhibitor tests using both visual and instrumental classification of the test results. The highest specificity values were obtained for the instrumental interpretation of the test results (94 - 99 % vs 90 - 96 %) due to the occurrence of samples with intermediate colorations (green-yellow, yellow-blue) making the visual classification more difficult and subjective. A relation was found between positive results in BRT MRL and Eclipse 100 tests and an elevated fat content in the goat milk. Positive outcomes in Eclipse 100 were associated with the butyric acid concentration in the milk. Further, the Delvotest SP-NT MCS test response was affected by elevated pH values, high lactoferrrin and myristoleic acid concentrations in the goat milk. This percentage of positive results could be minimized by a pre-treatment prior to microbial inhibitor test analysis, such as fat removal by centrifugation (3, 100 g for 10 min at 4 ºC) and/or heating (80 ºC for 10 min). Undoubtedly, improvements on the specificity of the microbial inhibitor tests for screening antibiotics in goat milk are desirable to avoid the destruction of milk compliant for human due to the occurrence of false positive results. The related financial losses affect farmers and dairies. However, it should be noted that the presence of contaminants in goat milk could be avoided by applying good farming practices designed to ensure that milk is obtained from healthy animals under proper hygienic conditions so ensuring the food safety of goat milk and related dairy products.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{compares the}} effect of dispersants which are <b>Sodium</b> <b>Laureth</b> <b>Sulfate</b> (SLS) and {{distilled}} water (DW) on the crystallization, particle size distribution and morphological behavior of nano alpha Alumina (α-Al 2 O 3) synthesized from Aluminium (Al) dross waste. The synthesizing of nano α-Al 2 O 3 via wet milling method was performed using a planetary mill for 4 hours at a speed of 550 rpm. The nano α-Al 2 O 3 powders with dispersants were characterized with x-ray diffraction (XRD), particle size analyzer (PSA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). XRD analysis shows the broadening and shifting of peaks after the sample was calcined at 1300 ̊C, indicating high crystallinity. The crystallite size of α-Al 2 O 3 milled with SLS is also smaller than the α-Al 2 O 3 milled with DW. These {{results are consistent with}} the PSA analysis in which the graphs displayed a symmetrical trend. Then, the PSA analysis is validated with TEM observation up to 100000 x magnification, particularly for α-Al 2 O 3 milled with SLS...|$|E
40|$|Hair shampoo is a {{personal}} care product that can removes dirt,skin particle,and sebum from hair skin. Mostly of hair shampoo consist of dangerous ingredient such as <b>Sodium</b> <b>Laureth</b> <b>Sulfate</b> which it produces skin and hair damages, including cracking and severe inflammation of tissue. Thus, Sapindus emarginatus {{will be used as}} main ingredient for a new formulation of hair shampoo. This herb material contains an active compound known as saponin which can replace the dangerous compound in hair shampoo. The objective of this research is to extract saponin from Sapindus emarginatus using ultrasound assisted extraction in order to formulate natural hair shampoo. The yields of saponin was measured by HPLC by study the effect of different size particle, sonication time and temperature. Based on result,the maximum amount of saponin extracted obtained at size particle 315 µm,sonication time at 60 minutes and temperature at 60 °C. The herbal extract was mix with other ingredients such as Methyl paraben and EDTA to form of a new formulation. The shampoo was tested using pH test. The extraction rate constant,k of saponin decreased with increasing temperature and sonication time,and the k values between range 0. 1091 to 0. 430. Thus,the saponin with higher concentration is used as main ingredient in order to formulate natural hair shampoo...|$|E
