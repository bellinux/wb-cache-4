5|$|The ACCC {{was granted}} <b>special</b> <b>leave</b> {{to appeal to}} the High Court against the {{judgment}} of the full bench of the Federal Court. The appeal was heard on 16 May 2007. The Australian Government Solicitor acted for the ACCC, with Lindsay Foster as Senior Counsel; Blake Dawson and David Yates SC represented Baxter. In addition to Baxter, the states of Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales were respondents to the appeal. The High Court decided on 29 August 2007, by a 6–1 majority, to allow the ACCC's appeal and remit the matter back to the full bench of Federal Court for reconsideration. The majority held that Baxter was not covered by derivative governmental immunity in its dealings with the state governments.|$|E
5|$|The ACCC was successful, by a 2–1 majority, {{upon the}} remittal {{of the case}} to the full bench of the Federal Court. The full bench found that Baxter contravened Sections46 and 47 of the TPA. That {{judgment}} ended the eight-year-long litigation between Baxter and the ACCC. It {{was the first time in}} over 10 years that a corporation had unsuccessfully defended a prosecution brought by the ACCC for an alleged contravention of Section46. The full bench declared that Baxter breached Sections46 and 47 of the TPA, but left it to the ACCC to seek pecuniary penalties. Baxter was refused <b>special</b> <b>leave</b> to appeal to the High Court against the full bench's judgment.|$|E

25|$|The High Court {{proceeded}} {{to apply the}} implied immunity of instrumentalities doctrine {{in a range of}} cases, many of which also involved taxation, and many of which were similarly controversial. In the case of Deakin v Webb, decided later in 1904, the Court held that Alfred Deakin was not liable to pay Victorian income tax on his salary {{as a member of the}} Australian House of Representatives, and as Attorney-General of Australia and later Prime Minister of Australia, based on the principles in D'Emden v Pedder. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council overruled the decisions in D'Emden v Pedder and Deakin v Webb in the 1906 case of Webb v Outtrim, but in Baxter v Commissioners of Taxation (NSW), the High Court held that the Privy Council had decided the case without jurisdiction, and upheld the doctrine. The Commonwealth Salaries Act 1907, settled the issue of state taxation by making all federal salaries subject to state taxes. The Privy Council declined <b>special</b> <b>leave</b> to appeal from the decision in Baxter v Commissioners of Taxation (NSW) as the result of Commonwealth law was that the controversy could not arise again.|$|E

2500|$|However, section 73 {{allows the}} appellate {{jurisdiction}} {{to be limited}} [...] "with such exceptions and subject to such regulations as the Parliament prescribes".

Therefore, while the High Court is the final court of appeal, it cannot be considered a general court of appeal. The decision as to whether to grant <b>special</b> <b>leave</b> to appeal is determined by one or more Justices of the High Court (in practice, a panel of two or three judges).

Kirby explains [...] "there have always been divisions, reflecting the different philosophies and perspectives of the office-holders", and that throughout the High Court's history, many dissenting opinions have ultimately been adopted as good law. Further, Kirby argues that the rate of dissent, if seen within its context, is relatively small. Cases heard before the full bench of the High Court have proceeded through a series of lower courts and <b>special</b> <b>leave</b> hearings. They are thus likely to test the boundaries of the existing law, and raise opposing, though no less valid, views of the law.|$|E
