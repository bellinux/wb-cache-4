The entire act of scientific <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>oriented</b> and shaped by the underlying picture of {{the empirical}} world that is used. This picture sets the selection and formulation of problems, the determination of what are data, the means {{to be used in}} getting the data, the kinds of relations sought between data, and the forms in which propositions are cast. In view of this fundamental and pervasive effect wielded on the entire act of scientific inquiry by the initiating picture of the empirical world, it is ridiculous to ignore this picture. The underlying picture of the world is always capable of identification {{in the form of a}} set of premises. These premises are constituted by the nature given either explicitly or implicitly to the key objects that comprise the picture. The unavoidable task of genuine methodological treatment is to identify and assess these premises".Howard S. Becker, being a disciple of Blumer, continued to develop his idea of a particular look at the objects under study, and in 1998 wrote a book [...] "Tricks of the Trade: How to Think about Your Research While You're Doing It" [...] where he gives a list of recommendations that may be useful in conducting sociological research. His main idea is to create a comprehensive picture of the object being studied, phenomenon or social group. To this end, he proposes to pay particular attention on statistical and historical knowledge before the conducting research, use critical thinking, trying to create a universal picture of the world, to make the result of the research understandable and acceptable for everyone.|$|E

30|$|The species {{studied in}} this paper, black spruce, {{is one of}} the most {{important}} boreal species in Canada. The wood is widely used in construction applications such as lumber and glued structural members. However, little information is available on its machining properties. This species has been included in a general study on Canadian woods undertaken by Lihra and Ganev [25]. Based on the ASTM D 1666 [26], cutting parameters for planing this wood were suggested when using a conventional peripheral planing process. Compared with other wood species, black spruce proved difficult to plane in a manner that produces defect-free surfaces. However, Cool and Hernández [21, 27] recently showed that peripheral planing induced good surfaces for mechanical adhesion of poly (vinyl acetate) glue and an acrylic water-based coating.
