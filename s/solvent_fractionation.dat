40|$|A {{detailed}} {{examination of the}} solution behaviour and crystallisation kinetics of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) is presented. The systems studied are: methyl palmitate, methyl stearate and their binary mixtures in dodecane and methyl oleate <b>solvents.</b> <b>Fractionation</b> behaviour in palm methyl ester, soybean methyl ester and rapeseed methyl ester fuel is also studied. Two principal techniques are employed in this work, i. e. turbidometric analysis of solutions during polythermal cycles and the gas chromatography analysis of solution supernatants {{as a function of}} temperature. The foundations of these two studied have been laid via the x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the solid-state forms of methyl palmitate and methyl stearate crystallised from solution. No evidence is found to suggest that the methyl stearate and methyl palmitate binary mixtures crystallise from methyl oleate solvent as a solid solution and no shift in the XRD patterns generated, i. e. no transition in solid state form crystallised is observed for the conditions under which solutions are crystallised. It is found that solution behaviour for methyl palmitate, methyl stearate and their binary mixtures in both solvents is in negative deviation to ideality, with the pure solutes being the more deviated in comparison to the binary mixtures. Eutectic points are discovered at a composition of 75 mol% C 16 : 0 in the C 16 : 0 I C 18 : 0 binary mixture crystallisation from both solvents. Metastable zone widths (MSZW) are larger for both solutes in the methyl oleate solvent (6 - 9. 50 C) as compared to dodecane (3 - 6. 5 oC) and MSZWs are significantly smaller at the 100 mI scale, being about half those at the 1 ml scale. Nucleation rates for both solutes and their binary mixtures are about 2 - 13 k gilimin over a 100 - 250 g/l concentration range in both solvents.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Milk fat was {{fractionated}} by <b>solvent</b> (acetone) <b>fractionation</b> and dry fractionation. Based {{on their}} fatty acid and acyl-carbon profiles, the fractions could {{be divided into}} three main groups: high-melting triglycerides (HMT), middle-melting triglycerides (MMT), and low-melting triglycerides (LMT). HMT fractions were enriched in long-chain fatty acids, and reduced in short-chain fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids. The MMT fractions were enriched in long-chain fatty acids, and reduced in unsaturated fatty acids. The LMT fractions were reduced in long-chain fatty acids, and enriched in short-chain fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids. Crystallization of these fractions was studied by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray dif-fraction techniques. In this study, the stable crystal form ap-peared to be the β′-form for all fractions. At sufficiently low tem-perature (different for each fraction), the β′-form is preceded by crystallization in the metastable α-form. An important differ-ence between the fractions is the rate of crystallization in the β′-form, which proceeds {{at a much lower}} rate for the lower-melting fat fractions than for the higher-melting fat fractions. This {{may be due to the}} much lower affinity for crystallization of the lower-melting fractions, due to the less favorable molecular geometry for packing in the β′-crystal lattice...|$|R

Objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate phytochemical, toxicity, and antileishmanial potential of Jurinea dolomiaea, Asparagus gracilis, Sida cordata, and Stellaria media collected from different areas of Pakistan. Dry powder of plants was extracted with crude methanol and fractionated with n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and water solvents in escalating polarity order. Qualitative phytochemical analysis of different class of compounds, that is, alkaloids, saponins, terpenoids, anthraquinones, cardiac glycosides, coumarins, phlobatannins, flavonoids, phenolics, and tannins, was tested. Its appearance was observed varying with polarity of <b>solvent</b> used for <b>fractionation.</b> Antileishmanial activity was performed against Leishmania tropica KWH 23 promastigote. Potent antileishmanial activity was observed for J. dolomiaea methanol extract (IC 50 = 10. 9 ± 1. ...|$|R
40|$|The rate of soil {{removal and}} its nature were studied {{with a small}} {{commercial}} high-temperature short-time pasteurizer. The commercial recirculation system was altered to provide a single pass of cleaning solution through the equipment to observe progress of cleaning. A composite of the first 38 liters was taken after 1. 5 minutes. Subsequent samples were taken after 3, 6, 22 and 21 to 22 minutes. Cleaning solutions were analyzed by centrifugal <b>fractionation,</b> <b>solvent</b> extraction, gas liquid chromatography, thin layer chromatography and infrared spectroscopy to determine the composition of residue and rate of its depletion. Results showed both {{the nature of the}} tenacious material and the rate of removal. Triglycerides were the predominant material in the tenacious residue, which resisted removal by circulation cleaning. Triglycerides were in solutions taken after several minutes of cleaning. Triglycerides per se were removed during cleaning, thus contradicting the concept that saponification {{is an integral part of}} the cleaning process. The sensitivity achieved indicated the potential application of instrumental methods for evaluating cleanliness of food processing equipment...|$|R
40|$|Phytochemicals and bioactivities of the {{heartwood}} {{and stem}} bark of Artocarpus anisophyllus Miq. have been studied. Extraction of the air-dried and powdered form of both parts {{was carried out}} by cold extraction method using n-hexane, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate as the <b>solvent</b> system. <b>Fractionation</b> and purification of the crude extracts have resulted in the isolation of eight compounds including flavonoids, triterpenes and a plant sterol. A new compound was isolated from the heartwood of A. anisophyllus which was identified as 3 ?-hydroxycycloartocarpin together with chaplashin, cycloartocarpin, artocarpin, derivative of artoindonesianin Z- 1, a mixture of stigmast- 4 -en- 3 -one and stigmasta- 4, 22 -dien- 3 -one, and ß-sitosterol. The last compound, 6 -hydroxystigmast- 4 -en- 3 -one was isolated from the stem bark of A. anisophyllus, together with derivative of artoindonesianin Z- 1 which previously isolated from the heartwood. Their structures were elucidated using spectroscopic methods including Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Infrared, Ultraviolet spectroscopies and Mass spectrometry. Bioactivities were carried out on the crude extracts and pure compounds. The antibacterial test on the crude extracts and pure compounds were carried out against the Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus and Gramnegative bacteria, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The most significant antibacterial activity was shown by the dichloromethane extract of the heartwood against E. coli with the MIC value of 125 µg/mL. Artocarpin showed moderate antibacterial activity against B. subtilis and E. coli with MIC value of 250 µg/mL. Derivative of artoindonesianin Z- 1 showed significant antibacterial activity against B. subtilis with MIC value of 250 µg/mL. The antioxidant assay using DPPH radical showed that the dichloromethane extract of the stem bark of A. anisophyllus possessed the highest radical scavenging activity with IC 50 value of 307. 24 µg/mL. Among the pure compounds tested, artocarpin showed the strongest radical scavenging property with IC 50 value of 69. 63 µg/ml...|$|R
