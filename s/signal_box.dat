5|$|The {{distinctive}} <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> overlooking Norwood Road and {{a similar}} <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> at {{the northern end of}} the station were demolished in 1956 and replaced by a single <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> adjacent to the north junction. The replacement <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was in use from June 1956 until December 1981, when its functions were transferred to Victoria; the building still exists and is used by railway staff. The signalling at Herne Hill was upgraded from semaphores to colour lights on 8 March 1959 as part of the Kent Coast electrification plan.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April 1957, the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was {{destroyed}} by a fire due to an electrical fault. The station was consequently put out of action. Using hand signals, a skeleton service {{was put in place}} on 8 April. A temporary <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was erected which came into operation on 5 May. Steam locomotives were temporarily banned from using the station, with Hastings Units being introduced into service earlier than planned. A full service was resumed from 6 May. Construction of a new <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> began on 19 April and it came into service on 16 December.|$|E
5|$|In September 1962 the {{passenger}} railway service from Barry to Pontypridd was terminated. Goods service at stations was cancelled in April 1964. but the through line was officially closed in July 1963 following the devastating fire at Tynycaeau Junction <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> in March 1963.|$|E
50|$|One {{of the two}} <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> on Gummersbacher {{station has}} served a local savings bank as a {{training}} centre since 2006. Most other <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> are now demolished or are disused.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{commercial}} electric bells {{were used for}} railway <b>signalling,</b> between <b>signal</b> <b>boxes.</b> Complex bell codes were used to indicate the types of train passing between <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> and the destinations to which they should be routed.|$|R
50|$|The station had {{passing loops}} round all {{platforms}} (for freight), two <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> and two turntables. The two <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> were positioned {{at the north}} and south ends of the station and controlled entry and exit to the tunnels that allowed entry to the complex.|$|R
5|$|On 25 April 1949, {{locomotive}} No. 46230 Duchess of Buccleuch was hauling {{a passenger}} train that overran a signal and was derailed at Douglas Park <b>Signal</b> <b>Box,</b> Motherwell, Lanarkshire. The signalman was {{suspected of having}} deliberately moved points under the train.|$|E
5|$|The 6S {{units were}} {{intended}} to be introduced into service in June 1957. On 5April a fire at Cannon Street <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> disabled all signalling equipment there. As a result, locomotive-hauled trains were banned from the station. A temporary <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was commissioned on 5May and the 6S units were introduced on peak services the next day. Two units coupled together formed the 06:58 and 07:26 Hastings–Cannon Street services in the morning, and the 17:18 and 18:03 Cannon Street–Hastings services in the evening. From 17June the 6S and 6L units were working services throughout the day. The 6B units entered service between May and August 1958.|$|E
5|$|There were {{initially}} two platforms, up and down. The up platform was accessed {{from the upper}} floor of the station building via a stairway outside the building. The station's original <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> elevated above the railway viaduct at the junction between Norwood Road and Half Moon Lane, was a prominent feature in Herne Hill for many years.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid 1930s {{the line}} was resignalled with colour light {{signaling}} and this came into use on 30 January 1938. The branch was controlled by <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> at Clapton Junction and Chingford intermediate <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> closed on this date (although the structures still contained equipment) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{enlarged}} {{layout of}} 1882 was controlled from two <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> that opened on 1 August of that year. Both boxes {{stood on the}} north side of the line. The East box had 45 levers, while the West box had 27. Both <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> closed on 30 October 1965.|$|R
25|$|New <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> at Eastern, Central and Western Junctions.|$|R
5|$|As KG 53 retreated out to sea, the German bombers dumped their bombs. Around 32 German bombs fell on {{the town}} of Shoeburyness. Two houses were {{destroyed}} and 20 damaged. One bomb landed on an Anderson Air Raid Shelter, killing {{a man and his}} wife. Another landed on the railway <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> killing the signalman. Several bombs fell on a War Department gunnery range, causing no damage. Some 200 German bombs {{fell on the}} mud flats and sandbanks off Shoeburyness. Many were delayed-action bombs, and went off at irregular intervals.|$|E
5|$|At 10:52am on 26 March 1907, {{an express}} {{passenger}} train travelling from Heworth <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> derailed on {{the approach to}} Felling station. The cause {{was a combination of}} a sharp frost in the morning and unseasonal heat later in the day which saw the track expand and kink. The derailment, which saw all bar two carriages rolled over entirely, cost two passengers their lives, with eight more seriously hurt and a further 34 suffering minor injuries such as shock.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} 1929 {{on a branch}} from Wembley Park to Stanmore to serve a new housing {{development}} at Canons Park, with stations at Kingsbury and Canons Park (Edgware) (renamed Canons Park in 1933). The government again guaranteed finance, this time under the Development Loans Guarantees & Grants Act, the project also quadrupling the tracks from Wembley Park to Harrow. The line was electrified with automatic colour light signals controlled from a <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> at Wembley Park and opened on 9 December 1932.|$|E

5|$|Glastonbury and Street {{railway station}} {{was the biggest}} station on the {{original}} Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway main line from Highbridge to Evercreech Junction until closed in 1966 under the Beeching axe. Opened in 1854 as Glastonbury, and renamed in 1886, it had three platforms, two for Evercreech to Highbridge services {{and one for the}} branch service to Wells. The station had a large goods yard controlled from a <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b> The site is now a timber yard for a local company. Replica level crossing gates have been placed at the entrance.|$|E
5|$|Quainton Road {{closed to}} {{passengers}} on 4 March 1963 and to goods on 4 July 1966. On 3 September 1966 the GCR line from Aylesbury to Rugby was abandoned, {{leaving only the}} stretch from Aylesbury to Calvert, running through the now-closed Quainton Road, open for freight trains. This {{was reduced to a}} single track shortly afterwards. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> at Quainton Road was abandoned on 13 August 1967, and the points connecting to the goods yard were disconnected.|$|E
5|$|The Severn Beach Line {{declined}} {{over the}} latter half of the twentieth century, with passenger numbers falling significantly. Goods services at Shirehampton ended in 1965, and all staff were withdrawn in 1967. The second platform and <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> were taken out of use in 1970, with the station buildings sold off and later destroyed by fire. Services had decreased to ten per day each direction by 2005, but have since increased to twenty-four trains per day.|$|E
25|$|The LB {{inherited}} the world's first <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> at Bricklayer's Arms Junction and Brighton Junction (Norwood). After 1880 it gradually developed its own architecture for <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> using home-produced and contractor-built frames. J.E. Annett, {{the inventor of}} Annett's key in 1875, a portable form of interlocking, was a former LB employee.|$|R

50|$|<b>Signal</b> <b>boxes</b> {{also served}} as {{important}} communications hubs, connecting the disparate parts of a rail line and linking them together to allow the safe passage of trains. The first signalling systems were made possible by technology like the telegraph and block instrument that allowed adjacent <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> to communicate {{the status of a}} section of track. Later, the telephone put centralised dispatchers in contact with distant <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> and radio even allowed direct communication with the trains themselves. The ultimate ability for data to be transmitted over long distances has proven the demise of most local control <b>signal</b> <b>boxes.</b> Signalmen next to the track are no longer needed to serve as the eyes and ears of the signalling system. Track circuits transmit train locations to distant control centres and data links allow direct manipulation of the points and signals.|$|R
5|$|The {{station was}} rebuilt {{in the early}} 1930s to enable the line to be four-tracked. The ornate {{buildings}} were demolished, and were replaced by more austere buildings on two island platforms between the tracks, including two waiting rooms, ticket and parcel offices. The new station was completed on 30 April 1932 and was accessed, as now, by a subway from Fraser Street. The station employed 15 men in 1938. There was a 74 lever <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{to the east of}} the northern platform, and also a small siding to serve local coal merchants.|$|E
5|$|The sub-surface {{station has}} twice {{been damaged by}} explosions. On 30 October 1883, a bomb planted by Fenians campaigning for an {{independent}} Irish Republic exploded on a train near the station. The bomb damaged the train it was on and a passing train along with part of the station and the <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b> Sixty-two passengers were injured. On the night of 13 October 1940, the station was hit by German bombs dropped during The Blitz killing five people in the station with four more subsequently dying of injuries.|$|E
5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, the GWR became the Western Region of British Railways. Goods traffic at Bedminster ceased from 1 June 1964, traffic to Portishead {{ended with the}} closure of that line in September the same year, and the station became unstaffed from September 1968. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{was taken out of}} service in April 1970, and by 1979 all the station buildings had been demolished.|$|E

5|$|Whitwell Station, on the Ventnor West {{branch of}} the Isle of Wight Central Railway, was opened {{along with the other}} {{stations}} on the branch on 20 July 1897. It was equipped with a passing loop, two platforms, a <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and a substantial station building. Located at the top of Nettlecombe Lane, the station is located close to the village and the community it was intended to serve, unlike any other stations on the line.|$|E
5|$|Between 5–28 June 1926, {{the station}} was closed to allow the Southern Railway to carry out various works, {{including}} the rebuilding of the platforms, relaying of the tracks and installation of {{a new system of}} electrical signalling – the four-aspect colour light scheme. The station was also renovated and the glass roof cleaned. The number of platforms was reduced from nine to eight, with five set aside for the new electric trains. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> spanning the width of the railway bridge was removed. In July 1939, Cannon Street was closed for a week following a fire in Borough Market which prevented any trains accessing it.|$|E
5|$|Each passing loop is {{controlled}} by a small <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> known as a block-post. These house the lever frames that control the points, the token equipment and telephones. The railway has few signals; instead it has stop boards at Pendre, Brynglas, Quarry Siding and Nant Gwernol, and the blockman allows trains to proceed by use of flags. There are colour light signals located at Tywyn Wharf, operated from the Control Office and disc signals controlled from the ground frame. Abergynolwyn has colour light signals, which are operated from the blockpost. When the block-post is unmanned, {{it is the responsibility}} of the locomotive crew to change the token before proceeding.|$|E
50|$|Modern <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> {{tend to be}} {{provided}} with VDU based, or similar, control systems. These systems are less expensive to build and easier to alter than a traditional panel. In the UK, large modern <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> are typically of the Integrated Electronic Control Centre type. Variations of these control systems are used throughout the world.|$|R
