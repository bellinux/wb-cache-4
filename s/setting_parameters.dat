Requests for the expected test results can be made within the test sequence to evaluate the system under test as it runs. It is also possible to place subautomatons in the Test-Step List, which in turn contain automatons and sequences, resulting in hierarchical Test-Step Lists. The test sequences can also be combined with other modelling methods, allowing for a great deal of complexity (or simplicity) in one's test. Test sequences can also be combined and parallelized with other modeling methods.|$|E

50|$|Bruno S. Frey (with Marcel Kucher) {{examines}} in {{the paper}} “History as Reflected in Capital Markets: The Case of World War ll”'''', how movements in bond prices {{can be linked to}} historical events. He finds in an econometric analysis’ of price movements of bonds issued by five European governments, which were traded on the Swiss bourse between 1928 and 1948, that most events to which historians attach great importance are reflected in price changes for bonds. However, some major events are not reflected, for example Germany’s capitulation in 1945. Frey and Kucher find for this particular case that bond prices already had changed much earlier when the Allied powers decided at Yalta that they would only accept a total capitulation at all fronts. This indicates an interesting friction between historians’ ex post evaluation of events and the price <b>setting</b> <b>parameters</b> for traders as an ex ante evaluation. Frey and Kucher discuss the potential insight for historical research using market data and econometric analysis. They refer to efficient market theory in order to identify three central advantages of capital market data to other data sources: (a) Data is correctly recorded since bourses are quasi-public. What is assessed is the decision makers expectations about the future; (b) Investors tend to evaluate the situation carefully because they are engaged with their own money; (c) Financial markets usually exhibit a high predictive power, due to marginal traders.|$|E
