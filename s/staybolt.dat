5000|$|Due to the {{constant}} expansion and contraction of the firebox a similar form of [...] "stress corrosion" [...] can {{take place at the}} ends of <b>staybolts</b> where they enter the firebox plates, and is accelerated by poor water quality. Often referred to as [...] "necking", this type of corrosion can reduce the strength of the <b>staybolts</b> until they are incapable of supporting the firebox at normal pressure.|$|R
50|$|After the State of California {{took over}} Railtown's operations, 28 {{continued}} {{to serve as}} its locomotive, operating seasonally.

5000|$|The [...] "Camel" [...] engines {{were all}} low-speed, heavy haul units. The speed {{was limited to}} 10-15 miles per hour by the steam {{capacity}} of the boiler, {{and the lack of}} a pilot truck. However, at that speed, a single [...] "Camel" [...] could haul a 110 car train of loaded coal hoppers on the level. The most distinctive feature of the [...] "Camel" [...] was the cab atop the boiler. They had a large steam dome, slide valves, and used <b>staybolts</b> in the boiler. More than 100 iron tubes, each over 14 ft long, were installed in the boiler.|$|R
