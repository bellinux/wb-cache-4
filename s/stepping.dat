40|$|We {{investigate}} phase {{transitions in}} a solid-on-solid model where double-height <b>steps</b> {{as well as}} single-height <b>steps</b> are allowed. Without the double-height <b>steps,</b> repulsive interactions between up-up or down-down <b>step</b> pairs {{give rise to a}} disordered flat phase. When the double-height <b>steps</b> are allowed, two single-height <b>steps</b> can merge into a double-height <b>step</b> (<b>step</b> doubling). We find that the <b>step</b> doubling reduces repulsive interaction strength between single-height <b>steps</b> and that the disordered flat phase is suppressed. As a control parameter a <b>step</b> doubling energy is introduced, which is assigned to each <b>step</b> doubling vertex. From transfer matrix type finite-size-scaling studies of interface free energies, we obtain the phase diagram in the parameter space of the <b>step</b> energy, the interaction energy, and the <b>step</b> doubling energy.

5|$|Saddlebreds are {{popularly known}} as show horses, with horses being shown saddle seat in both three-gaited and five-gaited classes. The former are the three common gaits seen in most breeds, the walk, trot and canter. The latter {{includes}} the three regular gaits, plus two four-beat ambling gaits known as the slow gait and the rack. The slow gait today is a four-beat gait in which the lateral pairs of legs leave the ground together, but strike the ground at different times, the hind foot connecting slightly before the forefoot. In the show ring, the gait should be performed with restraint and precision. The rack is also a four-beat gait, but with equal intervals between each footfall, making it a smooth gait to ride. In the show ring, the gait is performed with speed and action, appearing unrestrained. Historically, the slow gait could be either a running walk, the <b>stepping</b> pace, or the fox trot, however, the modern five-gaited Saddlebred usually performs the <b>stepping</b> pace.|$|E
