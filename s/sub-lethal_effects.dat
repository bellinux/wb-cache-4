5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{population in}} Europe crashed {{in the second}} half of the 20th century. The decline coincided with the introduction of cyclodiene insecticides – aldrin, dieldrin and heptachlor – used as seed dressings in agriculture in 1956. The chemicals accumulated in the bodies of grain-eating birds and had two effects on top predators like the Eurasian sparrowhawk and peregrine falcon: the shells of eggs they laid were too thin, causing them to break during incubation; and birds were poisoned by lethal concentrations of the insecticides. <b>Sub-lethal</b> <b>effects</b> of these substances include irritability, convulsions and disorientation. In west Germany, around 80% of nests before the 1950s produced young, but only 54% were successful in the 1960s and '70s.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{have long}} been {{concerned}} that pesticides, including possibly some fungicides, may have sublethal effects on bees, not killing them outright, but instead impairing their development and behavior. Of special interest is the class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, which contain the active ingredient imidacloprid, and other similar chemicals, such as clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a seed treatment because they are known {{to work their way}} through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to these chemicals. The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic problems could be caused by long-term exposure. In a laboratory setting, both lethal and <b>sub-lethal</b> <b>effects</b> on foraging behavior, memory, and learning ability have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages. Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of clothianidin in pneumatic planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields. Another 2012 study also found clothianidin and imidacloprid in the exhaust of pneumatic seeding equipment.|$|E
50|$|Field {{exposure}} of bees to pesticides, especially with relation to neonicotinoids, is most commonly sub-lethal. <b>Sub-lethal</b> <b>effects</b> to honey bees are of major concern and include behavioral disruptions such as disorientation, reduced foraging, impaired memory and learning, and {{a shift in}} communication behaviors.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the interaction between natural and anthropogenic impacts on the reefs of Rodrigues. Rodrigues remains undeveloped, however {{as a result of}} deforestation in the 1800 s, the reefs are subjected to episodic fluvial inputs following high rainfall, resulting in high sedimentation/turbidity within the lagoon. The island is also affected by natural impacts such as coral bleaching and cyclones. Despite these factors the reefs in Rodrigues are currently in good health. This study assessed whether fluvial inputs are having a <b>sub-lethal</b> <b>effect</b> on coral colonies on the fore reef slopes, by studying coral growth rates, larval settlement and recovery from injury at 3 sites with varying sediment regimes. The severity of a coral bleaching episode, which affected the island in 2002, was also assessed. The results show that at the 2 inshore sites (Totor and Trou Malabar) sediment deposition was well above `tolerable' levels for coral reefs (up to 96 mg crn 2 d- 1), suggesting that this threshold is not applicable for these reefs. It is suggested that high turbidity and sediment deposition are related to high rainfall, resulting in land run-off, combined with high wind causing sediment resuspension. This periodic high sedimentation and turbidity appeared to be having a <b>sub-lethal</b> <b>effect</b> on coral colonies, resulting in a decrease in growth rates of Acropora austera and Porites rus, low coral recruitment and a low ability of Montipora spp. to recover from injury.

We experimentally examined, at three different seasons (i. e. winter, spring, and summer), the effect of temperature (12, 18, and 24 °C) on the lethal (survival rates) and sublethal (oxygen consumption) toxicity of unionized ammonia (NH(3)) on the amphipods Gammarus pulex and Gammarus roeselii and the isopod Asellus aquaticus. Our results demonstrate (1) a gradient of increasing tolerance and survival from G. roeselii to G. pulex and A. aquaticus, (2) an increasing toxicity of ammonia with temperature, and (3) a strong seasonal variation of the tolerance to ammonia, with a higher tolerance of individuals in winter than in summer.

The impact of sub-lethal infections of pathogens on life history traits of affected hosts has been understudied in natural or semi-natural systems. The Speckled Wood (Pararge aegeria) is a satyrine butterfly that is common in temperate zones and has been extensively used as a model system for evolutionary ecology studies. It is known that the deployment of the immune system within this species, as with other invertebrates, is energetically costly and may result in trade-offs with fitness-related traits. In this study, we investigated the <b>sub-lethal</b> <b>effect</b> of exposure to Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) on life history and flight morphological traits of P. aegeria. Larvae were inoculated with increasing doses of AcMNPV and measurements made of life history and flight morphology traits. Generally, larvae exposed to virus took longer to develop to pupae and larval mass acquisition per day was significantly reduced in viral exposed larvae. However, viral exposed larvae were able to attain the same pupal mass and their duration as pupae was the same as controls. Forewing length, forewing aspect ratio, dry thorax mass and forewing loading were related to sex and bioassay differences but {{there was no evidence of}} any viral impact on these measures.

However, data on their potential biological effects on marine organisms, especially invertebrates, remain very limited. This proof of principle study reports the chronic sub-lethal toxicity of two coated AgNPs (oleic acid coated AgNPs and polyvinylpyrrolidone coated AgNPs) on marine benthic invertebrate larvae across three phyla (i. e., the barnacle Balanus Amphitrite, the slipper-limpet Crepidula onyx, and the polychaete Hydroides elegans) in terms of growth, development, and metamorphosis. Bioaccumulation and biodistribution of silver were also investigated. Larvae were also exposed to silver nitrate (AgNO 3) in parallel to distinguish the toxic effects derived from nano-silver and the aqueous form of silver. The <b>sub-lethal</b> <b>effect</b> of chronic exposure to coated AgNPs resulted in a significant retardation in growth and development, and reduction of larval settlement rate. The larval settlement rate of H. elegans was significantly lower in the coated AgNP treatment than the AgNO 3 treatment, suggesting that the toxicity of coated AgNPs might not be solely evoked by the release of silver ions (Ag+) in the test medium. The three species accumulated silver effectively from coated AgNPs as well as AgNO 3, and coated AgNPs were observed in the vacuoles of epithelial cell in the digestive tract of C. onyx.

In pneumatic drilling machines, seeds are sucked in, causing the erosion of fragments of the insecticide shell, which are then expelled with a current of air. Field tests found that foraging bees flying through dust released during the planting of corn seeds coated with neonicotinoid insecticides may encounter exposure high enough to be lethal. They concluded: [...] "The consequent acute lethal effect evidenced in all the field sowing experiments can be well compared with the colony loss phenomena widely reported by beekeepers in spring and often associated to corn sowing."

Bioassays were also conducted with two native Crustacea; the amphipod Paracorophium lucasi and freshwater crayfish (kōura) (Paranephrops planifrons) to test endpoints of survival, reburial behaviour and growth. Results of dissolved Cu, Pb and Zn showed the industrial Waitawhiriwhiri catchment, with higher impervious surfaces, to have the greatest potential for generating contaminants in stream waters. Relationships between sediment contaminant concentrations and upstream % impervious area suggest an association with stormwater runoff and metal accumulation. Shortfin eels from Gibbons Creek and Lake Rotoroa bioaccumulated high concentrations of Pb and As respectively in livers, and PAH metabolite pyrene- 1 -glucuronide in bile was found in many eels, highlighting the bioavailability of these contaminants. Muscle tissues cocnentrations of Pb and Hg in some sites triggered food safety guidelines presenting a low risk for human consumption. Amphipods exposed to sediments from Lake Rotoroa had significantly reduced survival compared with those exposed to other site sediments in a 10 -day sediment toxicity test. Photo-induced toxicity is not of concern for biota exposed to these sediments. Sediments did not induce any <b>sub-lethal</b> <b>effect</b> on reburial behaviour.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the lethal concentration, oviposition deterrence and ovicidal activity of acetone extracts of Melanochyla fasciculiflora (M.  fasciculiflora) leaf and Gluta renghas (G.  renghas) leaf against Aedes albopictus (Ae. albopictus). Methods: To determine the lethal concentration of Anacardiaceae, ten test concentrations of the extracts ranging from 200 to 650  mg/L {{were selected for}} larvicidal bioassays and 25 early fourth instar larvae {{were exposed to the}} extracts for 24  h. The sub-lethal concentrations used for oviposition deterrence was the value of LC 25, LC 50 and LC 75 from above study which is 235  mg/L, 470  mg/L and 705  mg/L for M.  fasciculiflora extract and 187. 5  mg/L, 375  mg/L and 562. 5  mg/L for G.  renghas extract, respectively. Twenty gravid Ae. albopictus were allowed to oviposit in different treated concentrations. For oviciding procedure, a total of 300 eggs of Ae. albopictus were soaked in solution with each treated concentration as mentioned above for 24  h. After 24  h, eggs were sieved and soaked in seasoned water, and hatching rates were calculated. For comparison, only seasoned water was used in control experiment. Results: G.  renghas demonstrated lower LC 50 value of 372. 80  mg/L compared to M.  fasciculiflora (467. 90  mg/L). The activity index of negative oviposition revealed the deterrent effect and thus, caused a remarkable negative response resulting in oviposition of fewer eggs compared with control (without plant extract). The acetone extract of M.  fasciculiflora was more effective than G.  renghas extract in displaying oviposition deterrence potential since the latter did not possess the deterring effect within the concentration range tested. However, both plant extracts exhibited excellent oviciding effect as 92. 33 % of eggs failed to be hatched when treated with 705. 0  mg/L of M.  fasciculiflora and 86. 67 % with 562. 5  mg/L of G.  renghas. The oviposition deterrence and percentage of egg mortality were directly proportional to the concentrations of extracts in both plants tested. Conclusions: These results clearly indicate that the acetone extract of G.  renghas could be served as potential larvicide, whereas M.  fasciculiflora has better <b>sub-lethal</b> <b>effect</b> for oviposition deterrence and against Ae. albopictus as an oviciding agent...|$|R

In this context, it is necessary to design and evaluate new compounds and methods that attenuate or even reverse the insecticide resistance trend. Olyset Duo is a novel LLIN that combines the insecticide properties of permethrin and the chemosterilising effect of pyriproxyfen (PPF). The rationale is that resistant mosquitoes that survive the contact with the net {{would not be able to}} transfer the resistance genes to the offspring, eventually influencing the resistant phenotype of the mosquito population. In the first part of this study the sterilising and <b>sub-lethal</b> <b>effect</b> of PPF and Olyset Duo was evaluated by a range of bioassays with laboratory and wild mosquito populations. PPF significantly affected the longevity, oogenesis, oviposition and hatching rate of susceptible and resistant mosquitoes, although the effect was partially diminished on the resistant colonies. The possible reasons and implications of PPF performance under controlled conditions are discussed. The second part of this thesis was done within the context of an Olyset Duo Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) set in Banfora District, Burkina Faso. The RCT had a stepped-wedge design which ensured that Olyset Duo nets gradually replaced Olyset nets in randomly allocated cluster of villages until the Olyset Duo coverage was total. Wild mosquitoes collected in sentinel sites with Olyset Duo showed evident signs of reproductive impairment even after 1 year of deployment. Insecticide resistance strength was monitored during the RCT in several sentinel sites, and time-response data showed an overall reduction of permethrin resistance strength after the distribution of Olyset Duo. This is the most detailed study on the effect of Olyset Duo on key entomological factors of wild mosquito populations. The standardised protocols as well as the dataset obtained are valuable information for ongoing evaluation of Olyset Duo and PPF as a tool for controlling malaria mosquitoes and as a potential alternative for insecticide resistance management...|$|R

Marine Biology, 148, (1), 189 - 196. Sponsorship: MARE - Research Council of Norway; EU Transnational Access to Research Infrastructures programme; Swedish Natural Sciences Research Council; Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf?s anniversary fund; Norwegian Academy of Science; NERCCourtship {{and body}} condition of male two-spotted gobies (Gobiusculus flavescens) harbouring naturally acquired microsporidian infections {{were compared with}} those of microsporidian-free males under standardized conditions in the lab. Although parasite infection had no apparent effect on individual condition, it significantly affected male courtship intensity. This effect, however, was affected by the intensity of the female courtship. Our study {{is one of the first}} to demonstrate a <b>sub-lethal</b> behavioural <b>effect</b> of a microsporidian parasite that could negatively affect the reproductive success of infected individuals. Our results also suggest that secondary sexual traits like courtship may be more sensitive to moderately detrimental effects of parasite infection than classical condition indices.
