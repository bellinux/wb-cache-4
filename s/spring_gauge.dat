25|$|The TAIC {{released}} its interim {{report on the}} accident on 10 May 2012. Examination of the wreckage showed electrical arcing on the basket {{and one of the}} four propane cylinders, consistent with a power line strike. Details about the maintenance and record-keeping of the balloon were released. The most recent inspection had occurred on 14 September 2011, with several errors made in the records and inspection. The inspection report erroneously recorded the type certificate as B2GL, which is applicable to Cameron Balloons United States for serial numbers 5000 and higher – ZK-XXF was manufactured in the United Kingdom and was serial number 4300, so the correct type certificate was BB12. It also recorded the basket and burners as being of Cameron Balloons, not as being of Thunder and Colt. Anomalies were also identified in the maintenance logbook, including incorrect identification of the basket and burners, no record of four airworthiness directives, and no entry regarding the use of the gas bottles. The maintenance provider was also found to be using outdated versions of the Flight and Maintenance Manuals, using the 1992-released Issue 7 rather than the current Issue 10, and that the maintainers had tested the strength of the envelope by hand, rather than the prescribed method of using a <b>spring</b> <b>gauge</b> to measure actual strength.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} supra-spinatus and subscapularis strength following repair of either isolated or anterosuperior subscapularis tears associated with a supraspinatus tear. Open subscapularis repairs were done in 24 patients, 12 isolated and 12 anterosuperior. At an average fol-low-up of 40 months, UCLA, ASES, and Constant scores were recorded. Subscapularis and supraspina-tus strengths were tested using a <b>spring</b> <b>gauge.</b> Ultrasound scanning was performed in 20 patients. Average scores were 27 UCLA, 77 ASES and 90 rela-tive Constant. Subscapularis strength was 92 % of the non-operated shoulder. Supraspinatus strength was 90 %. Statistical analysis showed a significant decrease in supraspinatus strength in the antero-superior group. No other significant differences were noted. Ultrasound scanning showed an intact subscapularis tendon in all. Full thickness supraspinatus tears were found in 5 and partial thickness in 1. Not the subscapularis, but the supraspinatus deter-mines the outcome of anterosuperior repairs, with more re-tears and decreased strength...|$|E

40|$|Force {{measurements}} {{from three}} dimensional polysilicon mechanisms under various loading conditions are presented. Force {{was measured using}} the deflection of polysilicon <b>spring</b> <b>gauges</b> with known dimensions and estimated elastic properties. Force measurements were made to determine the force required to overcome static friction when rotating hinged structures with and without external loading using a sliding mechanism. Both loaded and unloaded mechanisms display a wide statistical variation in friction force. Unloaded mechanisms require on average 1 - 5 N of force to move, whereas mechanisms manipulating 3. 5 N loads require on average 1 - 10 N of force. These measurements are motivated by an effort to produce articulated microrobots, and progress {{in this area is}} also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Tracer {{experiments}} were {{performed in the}} Brévilles test site in order to highlight vertical variations in groundwater fluxes related to vertical variations hydraulic conductivity, to estimate contaminant travel time from several locations in the catchment to the springs and to identify transport processes affecting the fate of solutes in the saturated part of the aquifer. Following a first tracer experiment with uranine and sulforhodamine G in 2003, four tracer injections were performed in November 2005 in different piezometers, using uranine, sulforhodamine B, iodide and lithium. Tracer concentrations were monitored in the injection wells and at the basin outlet (<b>spring</b> and <b>gauging</b> station). Using the FVPDM method, concentration evolutions monitored in the injection wells allowed one to estimate local Darcy fluxes. At the basin outlet, only two tracers were recovered.

30|$|To develop such an adapted water {{resource}} management which secures a safe, sustainable and long-term water supply in a karstic area like Gunung Kidul, {{a clear understanding}} of the processes causing and controlling variations in groundwater chemistry (including contaminants) and discharge is necessary (e.g. McConnell and Hacke 1993; Plummer et al. 1998; Birk et al. 2004; Katz 2004).

40|$|Single atomic {{monolayer}} (SAM) {{technology will be}} used to design an air bubble array for the lubrication of MEMS devices with sliding and rotating parts. Patterning a matrix of hydrophobic patches on a hydrophilic substrate will result in an array of air bubbles formed by the repulsive behavior of water molecules with the hydrophobic surfaces. The performance of the air bubble array will be determined by using a serpentine <b>spring</b> force <b>gauge</b> to measure the static friction required to pull a hydrophilic shuttle across the patterned substrate. Force calculations for air bubbles under hydrostatic pressure and a uniaxial compressive load show that the air bubbles will be able to withstand the external forces acting upon it. INTRODUCTON In MEMS devices with sliding and rotating parts, friction forces are the limiting factor to the successful performance of the device [1]. Previous work investigating the friction forces in micromotors suggests that hydrophobic lubricants are ideal for MEMS lubrication [1]. Alongside friction, adhesion is a common problem, especially in the fabrication process of various MEMS devices. Subjecting a structure to an aqueous rinse and dry cycle can form strong capillary forces that cause the collapse of beams and plates [1]. The application of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) is a popular technique for creating hydrophobic surfaces that repel water to prevent adhesion [1, 3 - 5]. There have also been recent studies on using SAM technology for fluid directing and fluidic self-assembly by patterning hydrophobic-hydrophilic surfaces [6, 7]. This report investigates the use of SAM technology to design an air bubble array for the lubrication of MEMS devices with sliding and rotating parts. Patterning a matrix of hydrophobic patches on a hydrophilic substrate will result in an array of air bubbles formed by the repulsive behavior of water molecules with the hydrophobic surfaces (see Figure 1). If a hydrophilic mate piece is placed on to...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the results of}} a series of investigations examining the operational performance followed by the fundamental re-development of two analytical instruments, namely a Pneumatic Spring Particle Sizer (PSPS) and handheld Spring Particle Sizer (handheld SPS) for size distribution analysis of dry powders in the 100 – 2000 μm size range. Each instrument shares the same basic principle of operation involving the use of a closed coil helical extension spring, which is partly filled with the test powder. Particle size distribution data is obtained by stretching the spring to known lengths and measuring the mass of the discharged particles from the spring’s coils. In the case of the Handheld SPS, aimed at on the spot quality control applications, the test particles are discharged from the spring using manual shaking. In the case of the PSPS on the other hand, the particles are discharged using pulsating pressurised air. The design, development and evaluation of two methods for the in-situ measurement of the sample mass within the PSPS are discussed. These include a full-bridge strain gauge assembly and the investigation of the correlation between the minimum fluidisation velocity and the mass of the test sample within the <b>spring.</b> The strain <b>gauge</b> proved to be a successful method producing a mass resolution of ± 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for the steady-state measurement of {{poloidal magnetic field}} near a tokamak plasma, where the tokamak is configured {{with respect to a}} cylindrical coordinate system having z, phi (toroidal), and r axes. The method is based on combining the two magnetic field principles of induction and torque. The apparatus includes a rotor assembly having a pair of inductive magnetic field pickup coils which are concentrically mounted, orthogonally oriented in the r and z directions, and coupled to remotely located electronics which include electronic integrators for determining magnetic field changes. The rotor assembly includes an axle oriented in the toroidal direction, with the axle mounted on pivot support brackets which in turn are mounted on a baseplate. First and second springs are located between the baseplate and the rotor assembly restricting rotation of the rotor assembly about its axle, the second spring providing a constant tensile preload in the first <b>spring.</b> A strain <b>gauge</b> is mounted on the first spring, and electronic means to continually monitor strain gauge resistance variations is provided. Electronic means for providing a known current pulse waveform to be periodically injected into each coil to create a time-varying torque on the rotor assembly in the toroidal direction causes mechanical strain variations proportional to the torque in the mounting means and springs so that strain gauge measurement of the variation provides periodic magnetic field measurements independent of the magnetic field measured by the electronic integrators...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} a curved spring element that may be utilized in a developed variable stiffness bracing (VSB) system to confer the variable stiffness characteristic of the system. VSB system is established to protect the structure against dynamic loads induced by earthquake, wind and etc. To obtain the curved shape of the spring, mathematical modeling is conducted. Direct compression experimental tests are conducted {{for a variety of}} models with different thicknesses and materials. The results of the experiments show a nonlinear stiffness trend for the curved spring element. In addition, to observe the yielding of the curved <b>spring,</b> different strain <b>gauges</b> are installed in several positions to record the strain in the models during the application of compression load. The results reveal that the geometry and material characteristics have an important effect on the stiffness value of the spring. Furthermore, finite element simulations of models are performed, and results are compared with those of experimental tests. The results from the experiments, as well as model and finite element simulation, show the curved spring's potential {{to be used in the}} developed VSB system and can be installed as a lateral resistance system in a structure subjected to vibration excitation such as an earthquake. Finally, the efficiency of the aforementioned system is evaluated via pushover analysis in a bare frame via finite element simulation. The results from pushover analysis illustrate the efficiency of the variable stiffness bracing system in framed structures...|$|R
40|$|While {{conventional}} turbines {{have been}} extensively researched and tested, Tesla and boundary layer type turbines have not. In {{order to construct}} a dynamometer, thermodynamic flow apparatus and future turbines, we modeled the Tesla turbine using theoretical calculations and preliminary experiments. Thus a series of experiments were run to determine stall torque and maximum run speed for a known pressure range. This data was then applied to modeling formulas to estimate stall torque over an extended range of variables. The data were then used to design an appropriate dynamometer and airflow experiment. The model data also served to estimate various specifications and power output of the future turbine. An Obi Laser SSTG&# 8208; 001 Tesla turbine {{was used in the}} experiments described. Experimental stall torque measurements were conducted in two stages. Shaft speed measurements were taken with an optical laser tachometer and Tesla turbine stall torque was measured using a <b>spring</b> force <b>gauge.</b> Two methods were chosen to model Tesla turbine stall torque: 1) flow over flat plate and 2) free vortex with a sink. A functional dynamometer and thermodynamic apparatus were constructed once the model was confirmed to be within the experimental uncertainty. Results of the experiments show that the experimental turbine at 65 PSI has a speed of approximately 27, 000 RPM and a measured stall torque of 0. 1279 N&# 8208;m. 65 PSI is an important data point because that data set is the cut&# 8208;off from laminar to turbulent flow. Thus at 65 PSI, a rejection of the null hypothesis for research question one with respect to the flow over flat plate method {{can be seen from the}} data, while the vortex model results in a failure to reject the null hypothesis. In conclusion, the experimental turbine was seen to have a laminar and a turbulent flow regime at different air pressures, rather than the assumed laminar flow regime. As a result of this model work, a new Tesla turbine of different dimensions was designed to adjust for flaws in the experimental turbine. The theoretical stall torque models were then applied to the new Tesla turbine design. Results of the models show that the vortex model sets the upper bound for theoretical stall torque for the new and the flat plate flow model sets the lower bound...|$|R
