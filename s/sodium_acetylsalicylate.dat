40|$|Studies of {{the effect}} of {{intravenous}} <b>sodium</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> (aspirin) on gastrointestinal blood loss with 51 Cr-labelled red cells were made on 15 healthy male volunteers. After a control period of five days 1 g. of <b>sodium</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> was infused over a period of 100 minutes twice daily for three days. Faecal blood loss was not increased...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> (100 mg/kg) {{intravenously}} {{injected into}} anaesthetized intact or decapitate cats caused {{an increase in}} body temperature. At a dosage of 30 mg per kilogram it caused a lowering of body temperature in the intact preparations, but again an increase in decapitate preparations. At a dosage of 10 mg per kilogram, no significant temperature change occurred in either type of preparation. Aspirin (in the form of <b>sodium</b> <b>acetylsalicylate)</b> is a systemic pyrogen and a centrally acting antipyretic. When it occurs, aspirin antipyresis must {{take place in the}} face of systemic pyrogenesis. Notable is the fact that aspirin (30 mg/kg) in the intact preparation lowers body temperature not only from fever levels, but also from normal and subnormal levels...|$|E
40|$|Measurement of gastric mucosal {{potential}} difference {{was used to}} study {{the effect on the}} gastric mucosal barrier in six volunteer subjects of several drugs known to provoke ulcers. Potential differences were also recorded in nine patients with rheumatoid arthritis being treated with long-term aspirin and five patients on long-term prednisone. Unbuffered aspirin and ethanol “broke” the barrier as shown by a rapid fall in {{potential difference}}. The effects of aspirin were dose related, with 600 mg causing a greater reduction than 300 mg. The effects of aspirin and ethanol given together were additive and caused the greatest fall in potential difference. <b>Sodium</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> did not alter the normal potential difference. Indomethacin, phenylbutazone, and prednisone all failed to cause any change in potential difference. The patients on long-term aspirin and prednisone had readings within the normal range and responded the same as normal subjects to an acute challenge. These studies show that aspirin and ethanol will damage the gastric mucosal barrier but that indomethacin, phenylbutazone, and prednisone do not...|$|E
40|$|Following oral {{administration}} of 1. 5 g of <b>sodium</b> salicylate or <b>acetylsalicylate</b> to five patients with indwelling T-tubes {{there was an}} approximately 50 % increase in bile flow. The increase {{appeared to be in}} the bile-acid independent fraction of canalicular flow and was not accompanied by a change in lithogenicity. Neither agent would be of use in the medical treatment of cholesterol gallstones...|$|R
40|$|Nanofibres have {{potential}} in biomedical and pharmaceutical applications including tissue engineering and drug release, which demand specific material properties {{to perform the}} required function without toxic side-effects, and preferably with minimal adverse ecological impact. Electrospinning is a promising technique for generating fibres with specific requirements and properties from organic, replaceable, non-toxic materials. Aqueous gelatin solution was chosen {{for its ability to}} react to changes in temperature. This work, including development of enhanced temperature control, demonstrated nanofibres of gelatin electrospun from aqueous solution with appropriate production conditions, which was previously unreported. To characterise the effects of the gelation mechanism caused by the partial reformation of the triple helix with aqueous gelatin solutions, electrospinning was attempted over a wide range of concentrations and temperatures. The study included measurements of the surface tension, viscosity and conductivity for the solutions, Scanning Electron Microscopy for size and form of product, and Wide Angle X•ray Scattering to ascertain the development of the structures from the solution to the fibre, determining the presence of the triple helix structure, and ThermoGravimetric Analysis to determine fibre water content. To provide comparison and continuity with previous studies, solutions of gelatin dissolved in glacial acetic acid, and polystyrene dissolved in MEK and DMF was electrospun and the products characterised in a similar manner to aqueous gelatin. Polystyrene solutions were chosen as examples of non-gelling solutions, thereby providing a contrast to the aqueous gelatin solutions. A potential area for nanofibres is in drug delivery. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) was considered as an example, but its solubility in water is insufficient to incorporate into electrospun nanofibres for this purpose. Hence, the soluble salt, <b>sodium</b> <b>acetylsalicylate,</b> which shares some of the same medicinal properties as aspirin, was chosen. Nanofibres were electrospun from a solution of gelatin and <b>sodium</b> <b>acetylsalicylate</b> dissolved in water, but then 'disappeared', presumed to have dissolved in air moisture. This demonstrated that gelatin nanofibres could be considered for drug delivery, but further studies would be required to determine methods to stabilise the fibres. Gelatin was dissolved in a suspension of cellulose nanofibres derived from carrots and the resulting liquid was successfully electrospun to produce nanofibres. The nanofibres did not exhibit the expected properties of the gelatin triple helix structure. Attempts to silver coat gelatin nanofibres for medical applications, using Tollens' reagent showed the fibres must be made less soluble by polymer cross-linking or otherwise. A limited study of incorporating gold nanoparticles within the nanofibres to increase their electrical conductivity was inconclusive as the elemental analysis equipment was unable to detect the gold.
