25|$|The viable <b>system</b> <b>model</b> (VSM) is a {{model of}} the {{organisational}} structure of any autonomous system capable of producing itself. A viable system is any system organised {{in such a way as}} to meet the demands of surviving in the changing environment. One of the prime features of systems that survive is that they are adaptable. The VSM expresses a model for a viable system, which is an abstracted cybernetic (regulation theory) description that is applicable to any organisation that is a viable system and capable of autonomy.|$|E
25|$|Together, the Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) act as {{a carbon}} sink, {{absorbing}} atmospheric carbon dioxide and storing it in solution. If the SAMW temperature increases {{as a result of}} climate change, the SAMW will have less capacity to store dissolved carbon dioxide. Research using a computerized climate <b>system</b> <b>model</b> suggests that if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration were to increase to 860 ppm by the year 2100 (roughly double today's concentration), the SAMW will decrease in density and salinity. The resulting reductions in the subduction and transport capacity of SAMW and AAIW water masses could potentially decrease the absorption and storage of CO2 in the Southern Ocean.|$|E

500|$|In 1956, Norman Phillips {{developed}} {{a mathematical model}} which could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere, which became the first successful climate model. Following Phillips's work, several groups began working to create general circulation models. The first general circulation climate model that combined both oceanic and atmospheric processes {{was developed in the}} late 1960s at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. [...] By the early 1980s, the United States' National Center for Atmospheric Research had developed the Community Atmosphere Model; this model has been continuously refined into the 2000s. [...] In 1986, efforts began to initialize and model soil and vegetation types, which led to more realistic forecasts. [...] For example, the Center for Ocean-Land Atmosphere Studies (COLA) model showed a warm temperature bias of 2-4°C (4-7°F) and a low precipitation bias due to incorrect parameterization of crop and vegetation type across the central United States. [...] Coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models such as the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research's HadCM3 model are currently being used as inputs for climate change studies. [...] The importance of gravity waves was neglected within these models until the mid-1980s. [...] Now, gravity waves are required within global climate models in order to properly simulate regional and global scale circulations, though their broad spectrum makes their incorporation complicated. [...] The Climate <b>System</b> <b>Model</b> (CSM) was {{developed a}}t the National Center for Atmospheric Research in January 1994.|$|E

500|$|These {{equations}} are initialized {{from the}} analysis data and rates of change are determined. [...] These rates of change predict {{the state of the}} atmosphere a short time into the future; the time increment for this prediction is called a time step. [...] This future atmospheric state is then used as the starting point for another application of the predictive equations to find new rates of change, and these new rates of change predict the atmosphere at a yet further time step into the future. [...] This time stepping is repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time. [...] The length of the time step chosen within the model is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid, and is chosen to maintain numerical stability. [...] Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes, while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes. [...] The global models are run at varying times into the future. [...] The UKMET Unified Model is run six days into the future, while the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' Integrated Forecast System and Environment Canada's Global Environmental Multiscale Model both run out to ten days into the future, and the Global Forecast <b>System</b> <b>model</b> run by the Environmental Modeling Center is run sixteen days into the future.
