500|$|The Chris Traeger {{character}} has received critical acclaim. Rick Porter of Zap2it {{described him as}} [...] "one of the great comedic creations of the past couple years", and Hitfix writer Alan Sepinwall called it [...] "one of the funniest performances of [...] career". David Hinckley of the New York Daily News said both Lowe and Adam Scott were excellent additions to the cast, and Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com <b>said</b> <b>Chris</b> was [...] "exactly what the show needed to push itself to another level of silliness". Some reviewers believed Chris' over-the-top personality would be funny in the short run, but that the character would not prove three-dimensional enough to have long-term sustainability. New York magazine writer Steve Kandell initially described him as [...] "funny, but sorta one-note", and Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic first found Chris funny, but likewise said he was [...] "not sure how great he'll be long term". Matt Fowler of IGN expressed the same sentiments after earlier episodes, but by the third season <b>said</b> <b>Chris</b> {{proved to be a}} great addition to the show.|$|E
500|$|The band hired Shirley {{and agreed}} to his {{recording}} conditions, which meant recording in New York City at Avatar Studios, taking weekends off and recording from 1:00–8:00pm. [...] Chris said of the rigid schedule, [...] "We loved it.... We had lives other than just being in the studio 24 hours a day, seven days a week. [...] Got a different vantage point on the whole thing." [...] Shirley's laid-back style also won praise from the band. [...] "Kevin is the first guy that I've worked with that just went with it—especially my singing. [...] A lot of this album is just my scratch vocals. It's very loose, and Kevin let it go.... He'd say, if we didn't get it {{in two or three}} takes, 'We'll come back tomorrow'", <b>said</b> <b>Chris.</b> [...] Of the album's lyrical bent, Chris said, [...] "...there is a lot of love on it, and I've never written love songs. [...] I do think having a muse in my life like the woman I'm with now helped.... I think there's also a lot of humor on this album, which is something we haven't touched on before, except maybe on Shake Your Money Maker, which was a lighter time and a lighter mood." [...] There was also a conscious effort to [...] "simplify the language", [...] which was inspired by Chris's listening to music by Otis Redding, George Jones and Muddy Waters. [...] "I realized how direct and honest those records were – and I wanted that here", <b>said</b> <b>Chris.</b>|$|E
500|$|Chris and Aidan later {{got back}} together, {{but after a}} few weeks, Chris broke up with Aidan for good. Chris ended the {{relationship}} because Aidan was not being honest about things. Chris learned that Aidan had been keeping Andrew's epilepsy and his own suspension from the hospital a secret. When Aidan then got into a fight and hid it, Chris became [...] "exasperated enough" [...] to end things. Mason <b>said</b> <b>Chris</b> was still in love with Aidan, so it was tough on them both. Aidan later made a [...] "desperate suggestion" [...] that they move in together, but Chris realised {{that it would be a}} bad idea. Mason quipped [...] "Chris is a pretty happy-go-lucky guy, so I don't think he'll be wallowing in self-pity for long." [...] Mason added that he would miss Morley, as he had enjoyed working with him during the storyline.|$|E
60|$|There was, <b>said</b> Uncle <b>Chris,</b> {{a future}} for {{the girl in the}} movies.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{wanted to}} speak to me?" [...] <b>said</b> Uncle <b>Chris,</b> {{bounding}} up. [...] "Certainly, certainly, certainly, of course. If you will excuse me for a moment?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] <b>said</b> Uncle <b>Chris.</b> [...] "But {{it will be}} {{a little}} {{difficult}} to continue the conversation on what you might call general lines. However!" ...|$|R
500|$|Texas fullback Antwan Cobb sprained {{his left}} {{anterior}} cruciate ligament late in the game, an injury that sidelined him {{for the rest of}} the season. Cobb's injury left the Longhorns without a true fullback, although they had not utilized the position often during the season. [...] The only other fullback on the team, Luke Tiemann, was expected to miss onemore week with a wrist injury. [...] Mack Brown <b>said</b> <b>Chris</b> Ogbonnaya, the second-team tailback, would move to fullback for the Baylor game. Freshman tight end Blaine Irby had taken some practice at fullback and could also be used in that position. [...] Robert Killebrew was benched after committing twopersonal foul penalties, a consistent problem for him in the 2007 season. [...] Without a veteran fullback, Texas planned to either run the ball out of the shotgun formation or simply focus on the passing game.|$|E
500|$|... "The Master Plan" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Matt Fowler of IGN {{said the}} budget problems created strong character development potential for Leslie and comedic opportunities for Ron. Fowler also enjoyed that the normally-dissolute Tom formed an authentic romantic connection, and <b>said</b> <b>Chris</b> Pratt brought [...] "a certain naturalness" [...] to {{a role that}} could otherwise have been overly idiotic. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club strongly praised the episode, praising Rob Lowe and the entire regular cast. He declared Parks and Recreation the best television show since Arrested Development, and said, [...] "As much as I like the '50 jokes a minute' style of comedies ... I'm a sucker for a show where the characters are as well-wrought and as purely funny as they are on this show." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall praised {{the implementation of the}} new characters, particularly the fact that the script did not rely too heavily on them. Sepinwall also said the episode balanced well the workplace humor with the romantic subplots between Leslie and Ben, April and Andy, and Ann and Chris.|$|E
500|$|... "Flu Season" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with many}} commentators praising {{the performance of}} Rob Lowe, whose character is usually physically fit to almost superhuman proportions but becomes extremely ill and hallucinatory when infected with the flu. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said Lowe's character now seemed well-integrated into the cast, adding [...] "If you've never believed Lowe can make you laugh out loud, pay attention to that episode." [...] Steve Kandell of New York magazine said Lowe stole the show from the usual Parks powerhouses of Offerman and Pratt, and called one scene, when Lowe tries to will away his flu by yelling to {{himself in the mirror}} [...] "Stop...pooping!", the [...] "single greatest self-effacingly comic moment of his long, handsome career". The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow said after two episodes, the pairing of Chris and Ann was already more interesting that Ann's entire relationship with Mark Brendanawicz in the second season, and that the new romance subplot allowed the normally [...] "" [...] Rashida Jones to display her comedic talents. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis <b>said</b> <b>Chris</b> [...] "really came into his own" [...] in the episode, and also said that Ann's relationship with Chris made her character more interesting and gave Jones greater comedic material to work with.|$|E
6000|$|... "There you are, my dear?" [...] <b>said</b> Uncle <b>Chris</b> indulgently, {{as though}} it were a toy he had made for her with his own hands. [...] "New York!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "America," [...] <b>said</b> Uncle <b>Chris,</b> [...] "taught me poker, {{for which}} I {{can never be}} {{sufficiently}} grateful. Also an exotic pastime styled Craps--or, alternatively, 'rolling the bones'--which {{in those days was}} a very present help in time of trouble. At Craps, I fear, my hand in late years has lost much of its cunning. I have had little opportunity of practising. But as a young man I was no mean exponent of the art. Let me see," [...] <b>said</b> Uncle <b>Chris</b> meditatively. [...] "What was the precise ritual? Ah! I have it, 'Come, little seven!'" ...|$|R
5000|$|A vocal {{sample from}} Weaver's track [...] "Silver Chord" [...] was used on [...] "Another's Arms" [...] from Coldplay's 2014 album, Ghost Stories. Weaver has <b>said</b> that <b>Chris</b> Martin telephoned her {{directly}} for permission.|$|R
500|$|In September 2011, Chris meets Warren Burrell (Tony Rickards), a {{homophobic}} customer at the garage. Warren {{makes his}} prejudice against gay people clear to Chris. Mason <b>said</b> <b>Chris</b> was unsure {{how to respond}} to the situation, as he has never met an adult who speaks about gay people in the way Warren does. Chris tells his boss, Lucas Fitzgerald, about Warren, but he is disappointed when Lucas does not do anything about it. Of Chris's situation, Mason explained [...] "It was very confronting for him. And because the guy wasn't pointing his remarks directly at Chris, Lucas didn't understand why Chris was so offended. At first, he didn't have an appreciation of how deep those comments hurt Chris." [...] The storyline divided the opinions of viewers with some understanding why Lucas would not want to confront Warren, while others were on Chris's side. Mason said he was pleased that viewers were discussing the storyline and he admitted he appreciated both sides. The actor said [...] "Lucas wasn't there when the customer was saying these things, so he didn't understand Chris's point of view. However, as the story went along, we saw Lucas change and his respect for Chris grew." [...] Mason added the storyline was about showing understanding for where a person is coming from and being willing to change your ideas.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{said after}} six episodes, he felt [...] "Rock Show" [...] was the episode where the Parks and Recreation {{found the right}} tone for the series and Leslie Knope character. Sepinwall said all the {{characters}} were very likable, the jokes seemed natural and the awkwardness of the show was turned down enough to work properly. The Hollywood Reporter writer Tim Goodman said while the first five episodes of the season had been disappointing, [...] "Rock Show" [...] marked an improvement in which [...] "the characters were more defined, their quirks and rhythms understood". Matt Fowler of IGN {{said he did not}} find the episode especially funny but that it {{did a good job of}} fleshing out the characters. He <b>said</b> <b>Chris</b> Pratt was especially funny, and that his band's song [...] "The Pit" [...] was stuck in his head after the episode. The A.V. Club writer Keith Phipps, who had mixed feelings about Parks and Recreation throughout the season, said [...] "Rock Show" [...] was very funny and restored his faith in the potential of the series. Phipps said he believed the show would become very popular in the second season, and that people would later claim to like the first season more than they did the first time they saw it. In October 2009, while reviewing the second season episode [...] "Sister City", A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce said he believed Parks and Recreation showed a streak of vast improvement that started with [...] "Rock Show" [...] and continued into the second season.|$|E
500|$|In January 2012, it was {{reported}} that Ne-Yo, along with his label imprint Compound Entertainment, had moved from Def Jam Recordings to Motown Records. He was also appointed Senior Vice President of A of Motown, where he would serve [...] "...as a producer and mentor to the label's artists, as well as seeking out and signing new talent to the label." [...] Ne-Yo was slated to release his fifth studio album, R.E.D. (as in [...] "Realizing Every Dream"), on September 18, 2012. The album was initially titled The Cracks in Mr. Perfect. The album's first official single, [...] "Lazy Love", was released on June 12, 2012 and peaked at number forty-two on the US Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart. [...] "Let Me Love You (Until You Learn to Love Yourself)", co-written by Australian singer-songwriter Sia, was released as the second single on July 31, 2012. Because of Kevin McCall's new album and the song Ne-Yo will be in, [...] "Love Time", was not yet released because he and his friend Chris Brown will make an appearance on Ne-Yo's R.E.D. album in the song called [...] "What I Do", which they all will be involved in writing the beat says Ne-Yo, who was interviewed by TMZ in New York. [...] "I expect this to be a banger in clubs for the slow songs and to get Ne-Yo his first top 10 song in years," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Chris</b> Brown, after a celebrity basketball game with Ne-Yo, Kevin Hart, and other celebrities in the month of July.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us {{hope that}} you are, my boy," [...] <b>said</b> Uncle <b>Chris</b> gravely. [...] "For in that case I should be forced into {{a course of action}} from which I confess that I shrink." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't I {{tell you}} about that?" [...] <b>said</b> Uncle <b>Chris</b> cheerily--avoiding her eye, however, for he had {{realized}} all along {{that it might be}} a little bit awkward breaking the news. [...] "I've arranged that you shall go and stay for the time being down at Brookport--on Long Island, you know--over in that direction--with your Uncle Elmer. Daresay you've forgotten you have an Uncle Elmer, eh?" [...] he went on quickly, as Jill was about to speak. [...] "Your father's brother. Used to be in business, but retired some years ago and goes in for amateur farming. Corn and--and corn," [...] <b>said</b> Uncle <b>Chris.</b> [...] "All that sort of thing. You'll like him. Capital chap! Never met him myself, but always heard," [...] <b>said</b> Uncle <b>Chris,</b> who had never to his recollection heard any comments upon Mr. Elmer Mariner whatever, [...] "that he was a splendid fellow. Directly we decided to sail, I cabled to him, and got an answer saying that he would be delighted to put you up. You'll be quite happy there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{can hardly}} call Nervino that," [...] <b>said</b> Uncle <b>Chris</b> reproachfully. [...] "It is a {{sovereign}} specific. You {{can get it}} at any drug store. It comes in two sizes, the dollar-fifty--or large--size, and the...." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2012, ORNL {{researchers}} {{announced the}} successful {{development of a}} new adsorbent material dubbed [...] "HiCap", which vastly outperforms previous best adsorbents, which perform surface retention of solid or gas molecules, atoms or ions. [...] "We have shown that our adsorbents can extract five to seven times more uranium at uptake rates seven times faster than the world's best adsorbents," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Chris</b> Janke, one of the inventors and a member of ORNL's Materials Science and Technology Division. HiCap also effectively removes toxic metals from water, according to results verified by researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2011 Wal-Mart {{recalled}} {{a quantity of}} infant formula after a baby died in Missouri. [...] "We extend our deepest condolences to this baby boy's family {{as they try to}} come to grips with their loss," [...] said Dianna Gee, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman. [...] "As soon as we heard what happened, we immediately reached out to the manufacturer of the formula and to the Department of Health and Senior Services to provide any information we may have to help with the investigation." [...] Wal-Mart said it pulled a batch of Enfamil from its stores nationwide that matched the size and lot number ZP1k7G of the formula that may have sickened the baby in Missouri, Gee said. The baby formula was purchased from a Wal-Mart in Lebanon, Missouri. After the purchase, a 10-day-old infant died from a rare bacterial infection, CNN affiliate KYTV reported. Authorities ran tests to determine if the death came from the formula, the water to make the formula or any other factor, said Mead Johnson Nutrition, the company that makes Enfamil. [...] "We are highly confident in the safety and quality of our products – and the rigorous testing we put them through," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Chris</b> Perille, a Mead Johnson Nutrition spokesman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, anyhow I {{wasted no}} time on Greek and Latin," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Chris</b> Robinson. [...] "And one learns to go {{straight}} at a thing without splitting straws. One gets hold of the Elementals." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a noble pursuit," [...] <b>said</b> Uncle <b>Chris</b> firmly. [...] "Worthy of {{the great}} nation that has {{produced}} it. No doubt, when I return to America, I shall have opportunities of recovering my lost skill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{come with}} you, Freddie my boy," [...] <b>said</b> Uncle <b>Chris,</b> who felt an {{imperative}} need of five minutes' respite from Mrs. Peagrim. [...] "Let's get {{out into the}} air for a moment. Uncommonly warm it is here." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "All right. Better take old Buff; he'll {{bring you}} home {{when you get}} lost, and keep puss from clawing you. You won't like {{that part of the}} fun as much as you expect to, maybe," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Chris,</b> with a sly twinkle of the eye, as he glanced at Corny and then away to the vast forest that {{stretched}} far up the mighty mountain's side.|$|E
6000|$|... "Anderson is a capitalist," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Chris</b> Dorn, {{deep in his}} beard. [...] "He seeks {{control of}} farmers and wheat in the Northwest. Ranch after ranch he's gained by taking up and foreclosing mortgages. He's against labor. He grinds down the poor. He cheated Neuman out of a hundred {{thousand}} bushels of wheat. He bought up my debt. He meant to ruin me. He--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't say that, Miss Trotter," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Chris</b> pleadingly, {{yet with}} a slight wincing at her words; [...] "YOU could {{convince}} her, if you would only try. Only let her see that she has some other friends beside myself. Look! Miss Trotter, I'll leave it all to you--there! If you will only help me, I will promise not to see her--not to go near her again--until you have talked with her. There! Even my brother would not object to that. And if he has every confidence in you, I'm showing you I've more--don't you see? Come, now, promise--won't you, dear Miss Trotter?" [...] He again took her hand, and this time pressed a kiss upon her slim fingers. And this time she did not withdraw them. Indeed, it seemed to her, in the quick recurrence of her previous sympathy, as if a hand had been put into her loveless past, grasping and seeking hers in its loneliness. None of her school friends had ever appealed to her like this simple, weak, and loving young man. Perhaps it was because they were of her own sex, and she distrusted them.|$|E
500|$|The ATV News Network <b>said</b> the <b>Chris's</b> {{coming out}} should be praised {{for the way}} it has been handled. They added that the {{decision}} to play it out at a school would have viewers in a similar situation identifying with the storyline. Alan McKee, a university film and television professor, said that usually subscription television channels take risks in portraying storylines like Chris's. He added [...] "Commercial TV is not about risk taking, it is about entertainment for the broadest possible audience. But attitudes have changed and commercial networks like to reflect that". Holy Soap <b>said</b> <b>Chris's</b> most memorable moment was [...] "Announcing to his entire class that he was gay." [...] Anthony D. Langford from website, AfterElton said he found it [...] "humorous" [...] that Neighbours emphasizes what a gentleman Chris is compared to Andrew. He said [...] "It's like they're almost saying if you're a nice guy who's not all over your girlfriend you must be gay. But on television that's usually the case". Langford hoped that Chris would not vanish and {{that he would not be}} relegated to monitoring the relationship between Andrew and Summer and not having a romance of his own.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stupid idiot!" [...] <b>said</b> Uncle <b>Chris</b> testily. [...] "These New York hall-porters are {{recruited}} {{entirely from}} {{homes for the}} feeble-minded. I suppose he was a new man. Well, Pilkington, my boy, I shall expect you at seven o'clock. Good-bye till then. Come, Jill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] <b>said</b> Uncle <b>Chris,</b> [...] "is a {{perfectly}} justified slur. I shudder at the depths to which prosperity has {{caused me to}} sink." [...] He expanded his chest. [...] "I shall be a different man in America. America would make a different man of you, Freddie." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It's totally legit {{that he can}} {{get into}} the NFL," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Chris</b> Kluwe, punter for the Minnesota Vikings. Kluwe {{believed}} that place-kicking, which is limited to one specific skill set, allowed proficient kickers to be successful even if they had taken a break from the game for years.|$|E

5000|$|Oil {{companies}} such as Occidental Petroleum are using acidizing to stimulate production in Monterey wells, and other companies are experimenting with proprietary mixes of hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids.
