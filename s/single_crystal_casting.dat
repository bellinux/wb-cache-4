The {{results showed that}} the withdrawal rate obviously effected on the average area fraction, number and diameter of porosities except their radius ratios. In consideration of the microstructure observation for dendrite arms, an optimized withdrawal rate was obtained with a minimum porosity level as about 125  µm s− 1.

40|$|In this work, the microstructures of {{superalloy}} specimens produced using selective {{electron beam}} melting additive manufacturing were characterized. The materials were produced using a CMSX- 4 powder. Two selective {{electron beam melting}} processing strategies, which result in higher and lower effective cooling rates, are described. Orientation imaging microscopy, {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} and conventional high resolution transmission electron microscopy are used to investigate the microstructures. Our results suggest that selective electron beam melting processing results in near equilibrium microstructures, as far as γ′ volume fractions, the formation of small amounts of TCP phases and the partitioning behavior of the alloy elements are concerned. As expected, higher cooling rates result in smaller dendrite spacings, which are two orders of magnitude smaller than observed during conventional <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>casting.</b> During processing, columnar grains grow in directions, which are rotated with respect to each other.

Since introduction of <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>casting</b> technology, SX alloy development has focused on increased temperature capability, and major improvements in alloy performance {{have been associated with}} the introduction of new alloying elements, including rhenium (Re) and ruthenium (Ru). 3 % Re-containing second generation alloys have seen the greatest market utilization and have become the benchmark alloys for comparing new alloy developments.

These molds are applied for producing precise <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>casts</b> of nickel based superalloys to elements witch are applied to the hot section of aircraft jet engines. Design/methodology/approach: The processes of milling were carried out using the vibratory mill Herzog HSM 100 H and the planetary grinder Pulverisette 7 - Fritsch Company. The measurements of all kinds of powders were conducted by using of the Kamika IPS U Analyzer and Malvern Nanosizer-ZS. To the purpose of analysis of the chemical composition an X-ray microanalysis technique was applied with the dispersion of the energy (EDS) using of Thermo and Noran equipment. Findings: On the basis of examinations carried out on the powders before and after processes of milling and after processes of pressing and sintering of powders, it is possible to state that technological processes of reuse and further applying of used molds are possible. Processes of pressing were conducted applying different amounts of powders.

The basis of the model is a thermal analysis of the heat transfer {{in the vicinity of the}} chill region onto which the molten metal is poured. Subsequently the competitive growth of grains during directional solidification is simulated via a cellular-automaton technique. For the purpose of model validation, processing trials have been carried out on a commercial <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>casting</b> furnace. The thermal cycles set up in and around the vicinity of the grain selector have been measured, and these are used to choose a number of critical parameters in the thermal model.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>casting</b> techniques {{has led to}} the development of existing nickel-base superalloys to produce materials with optimum mechanical properties in the single crystal condition. As single crystals are known to be anisotropic, a study is needed to determine the general mechanical properties of these materials, and determine the effects of crystal orientation upon them. A study has been carried out to identify the effect of orientation and temperature on the creep and fatigue properties of a development single crystal superalloy, SRR 99. Creep testing and crystal rotation experiments have been made on SRR 99 and an earlier development alloy, SRR 9. Fatigue experiments at elevated temperatures have been carried out on both notched and un-notched specimens of alloy SRR 99. To aid in this analysis, several analytical techniques have been employed including Laue x-ray orientation analysis, measurement of strain by photographic methods and microstructural examination. Crystal rotation experiments have indicated that shear of 1 precipitates by lbrace 111 rbrace slip systems is operative during primary creep deformation at temperatures of 750 oC and 850 oC. The effect of orientation variation obtained by standard casting practices was not found to be significant. Creep rupture was found to be associated with multiple crack initiation from micropores. Fatigue crack initiation in un-notched specimens was found to be related to microporosity and microstructural defects. Failure was predominantly by crystallographic crack growth on lbrace 111 rbrace planes. The use of linear elastic fracture mechanics to describe fatigue crack propagation in alloy SRR 99 was found to be acceptable at temperatures up to 850 oC. Variation of temperature, frequency and crystal orientation was found to have only moderate effect upon crack propagation rates...|$|E

At {{least half of the}} new generating capacity added in the US over the next twenty years will be combustion turbine systems. The Department of Energy has cosponsored with Siemens Westinghouse, a program to maintain the technology lead in gas turbine systems. The very ambitious eight year program was designed to demonstrate a highly efficient and commercially acceptable power plant, with the ability to fire a wide range of fuels. The main goal of the Advanced Turbine Systems (ATS) Program was to develop ultra-high efficiency, environmentally superior and cost effective competitive gas turbine systems for base load application in utility, independent power producer and industrial markets. Performance targets were focused on natural gas as a fuel and included: System efficiency that exceeds 60 % (lower heating value basis); Less than 10 ppmv NO{sub x} emissions without the use of post combustion controls; Busbar electricity that are less than 10 % of state of the art systems; Reliability-Availability-Maintainability (RAM) equivalent to current systems; Water consumption minimized to levels consistent with cost and efficiency goals; and Commercial systems by the year 2000. In a parallel effort, the program was to focus on adapting the ATS engine to coal-derived or biomass fuels. In Phase 1 of the ATS Program, preliminary investigators on different gas turbine cycles demonstrated that net plant LHV based efficiency greater than 60 % was achievable. In Phase 2 the more promising cycles were evaluated in greater detail and the closed-loop steam-cooled combined cycle was selected for development because it offered the best solution with least risk for achieving the ATS Program goals for plant efficiency, emissions, cost of electricity and RAM. Phase 2 also involved conceptual ATS engine and plant design and technology developments in aerodynamics, sealing, combustion, cooling, materials, coatings and casting development. The market potential for the ATS gas turbine in the 2000 - 2014 timeframe was assessed for combined cycle, simple cycle and integrated gasification combined cycle, for three engine sizes. The total ATS market potential was forecasted to exceed 93 GW. Phase 3 and Phase 3 Extension involved further technology development, component testing and W 501 ATS engine detail design. The technology development efforts consisted of ultra low NO{sub x} combustion, catalytic combustion, sealing, heat transfer, advanced coating systems, advanced alloys, <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>casting</b> development and determining the effect of steam on turbine alloys.

Small fusion zone as 0. 09154 mm was found. No heat affected zone of <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> was detected. Also, no microstructural damage was found along the fusion zone. Dislocation density before and after CDW were not different because there was no statistically significant difference between the etch pit density in the fusion zone and that outside the fusion zone. In summary, regardless of voids, CDW may be a useful method for welding <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> metals...|$|R

Seed crystals of SrTiO 3 were buried in 0. 96 (Na 1 / 2 Bi 1 / 2) TiO 3 - 0. 04 CaTiO 3 (NBT- 4 CT) powder which was then pressed into pellets. Pellets were sintered and <b>single</b> <b>crystals</b> of NBT- 4 CT grew on the seeds. Electron probe micro analysis shows that the chemical composition of the <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> is close to the nominal composition. X-ray diffraction and micro-Raman scattering analysis shows that the <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> has the rhombohedral (Na 1 / 2 Bi 1 / 2) TiO 3 structure. <b>Single</b> <b>crystals</b> were also grown by bonding a seed crystal to a pre-sintered NBT- 4 CT pellet and annealing. The <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> shows dielectric behavior similar to that of NBT- 4 CT ceramics and other (Na 1 / 2 Bi 1 / 2) TiO 3 -based ceramics and <b>single</b> <b>crystals.</b> Characteristic dielectric transitions can be related to the rhombohedral-tetragonal and tetragonal-cubic phase transitions. The NBT- 4 CT <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> has improved ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties compared to the bulk polycrystalline ceramic...|$|R
