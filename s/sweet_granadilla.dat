40|$|In Colombia, we {{have found}} 165 species that belong to the Passiflora genus and, of these, about 50 % have edible fruits. Among these, passion fruit, <b>sweet</b> <b>granadilla</b> and purple passion fruit are {{considered}} to be of economic importance. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of fruit ripeness and pulp fermentation time period (mucilage) on the seed germination of passion fruits (Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa Deg.) and sweet granadillas (Passiflora ligularis Juss.) under laboratory conditions (alternating temperatures (30 / 20 ºC, 12 / 12 hour), 60 % relative humidity and in darkness for 60 days) and to establish growth parameters leaf area and plant dry mass. The seeds were extracted from fruits in three maturity stages (M 4, M 5 and M 6) and five fermentation periods (0 days (F 0); 1 day (F 1), 2 days (F 2), 4 days (F 4) and 8 days (F 8)) using a completely random design with a 3 x 5 factorial arrangement (maturity stage x fermentation time), with four replicates of 50 seeds each. It was found that the M 6 F 1 and M 5 F 1 treatments were more favorable in terms of germination for the passion fruit (94. 5 and 92. 0 %, respectively), while, for the <b>sweet</b> <b>granadilla,</b> the M 6 F 2 (39 %) and M 6 F 1 (35 %) treatments were more favorable. The growth parameters demonstrated that the highest dry mass value occurred in M 6 F 8 for the passion fruit (136. 76 mg) and in M 6 F 1 for the <b>sweet</b> <b>granadilla</b> (104. 73 mg); furthermore, these values increased as the maturity stage of the two species progressed. The leaf area of the passion fruit had maximum values in seedlings obtained from the treatment with maturity stage M 5 F 2 and a fermentation period of 1 day, M 5 F 2 (18. 3 cm 2), while the leaf area of the <b>sweet</b> <b>granadilla</b> increased in the same fashion as the dry mass, with M 6 F 8 having the highest value (16. 8 cm 2) ...|$|E
40|$|Passiflora seeds {{germinate}} erratically presenting {{difficulties for}} their handling in a greenhouse. The effect of removing of basal point of seeds (RB) and pre-imbibition of seeds of <b>sweet</b> <b>granadilla</b> and yellow passion fruit in 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg mL- 1 solutions of gibberellic acid (GA 3) or 0. 1 % KNO 3 solution was studied. The experiment {{was conducted in}} greenhouses in La Plata, Colombia. Two accessions PrJ 1 and PrJ 2 of <b>sweet</b> <b>granadilla</b> were evaluated. There were calculated the final percentage of germination (PG), mean germination time (MGT), and the mean germination rate (MGR). The leaf area and dry mass of seedlings were measured 22 days after sowing (das); with this data, specific leaf area and relation root/shoot were calculated. In all cases, the highest germination percentages were achieved treating seeds with KNO 3 (89, 92, and 87 % for yellow passion fruit, PrJ 2, and PrJ 1, respectively), but the increase in MGR (3. 3 germinated seeds per day) and the decrease in MGT (16 days) were only significant for PrJ 1. RB had a significant reduction of PG in all cases (28, 12, and 33 % for passion fruit, PrJ 2 and PrJ 1, respectively). With {{the increase in the}} concentration of GA 3, PG was reduced for two accessions of <b>sweet</b> <b>granadilla,</b> for yellow passion fruit this trend was not clear, no treatment with GA 3 showed significant differences with the control. Leaf area (24. 07 cm 2) and dry mass of seedlings (135 mg) were significantly higher than seeds previously treated with KNO 3 only for PrJ 1. The solution of KNO 3 0, 1 % is recommended to improve the germination and initial growth of granadilla seedlings...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{histology}} and morphology of seeds of genus Passiflora {{has been of}} high utility for the classification of species. In seeds of <b>sweet</b> <b>granadilla,</b> the histological characteristics and methodologies for their study are unknown. This study was aimed to know the tissue and morphological characteristics of the seed coats of seeds of <b>sweet</b> <b>granadilla</b> {{and to be able}} to determine its value in the differentiation of accessions. Five accessions collected in producing zones of the Province of Huila, Colombia, were analyzed. In morphological analysis, all accessions presented falsifoveate ornamentation and entire margin. The seeds presented high change in weight and size for every accession; there stood out the seeds of the accession PmN for presenting major size (7. 42 mm long), weight (35. 62 mg), homogeneity in these variables and a typical orange color. For the histological analysis, a protocol was adapted to realize sections of seed coats in parafin, by means of which one managed to obtain sections (7 μ) that in the optical microscope show clearly three well differentiated layers, belonging, possibly, to exotegmen (internal layer), mesotesta (medium layer) and exotesta (external layer). Every layer presented differences in the form of the cells, color and thickness, between the sections of the basal and medium parts of the seeds, but the differences between the analyzed accessions were not observed. The majority of seeds had a thickness of seed coats that varied among 235 and 475 μ...|$|E
40|$|Dasiops spp. are {{the most}} {{important}} pest in cultivated Passiflora plants. Larvae of these fruit flies are herbivores, feeding on flower buds and fruit of yellow passionfruit, <b>sweet</b> <b>granadilla,</b> banana passionfruit and purple passionfruit crops located in Cundinamarca and Boyaca, Colombia. Geographic distribution, natural abundance and percentage of parasitoidism for every Dasiops species by each plant species were determined. Aganaspis pelleranoi (Hymenoptera: Figitidae) was found to be a parasitoid of D. inedulis (14. 19 - 50. 00 %), infesting flower buds of yellow passionfruit and fruit of <b>sweet</b> <b>granadilla</b> (7. 41 %). Microcrasis sp. (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was found to be parasitizing both D. gracilis (0. 83 - 3. 13 %) and D. inedulis (0. 83 %) in purple and yellow passionfruit. Trichopria sp. and Pentapria sp. (Hymenoptera: Diapriidae) were found to be parasitizing D. inedulis (40. 00 % and 4. 17 - 20. 00 %, respectively) and D. gracilis (1. 69 - 22. 22 % and 1. 67 - 29. 17 %, respectively) in purple passion fruit. Dasiops caustonae was found to be infesting banana passionfruit only in Boyaca, naturally parasitized by Pentapria sp. (11. 11 - 33. 33 %). Because Pentapria sp. had a wide geographical distribution as an idiobiont of Dasiops spp. pupae, in all of the assessed cultivated Passiflora species, despite a high selection pressure by chemical control distributed at regular calendar intervals, it would be a crucial strategy in pest management control. Collecting fallen flower buds and fruit infested by Dasiops spp. is important to truncate the life cycle of fruit flies and allow emergence of parasitoids. This simple cultural strategy could have important implications in reducing production costs, increased crop yields and environmental care...|$|E
