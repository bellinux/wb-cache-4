5|$|The {{buttonquail}} are {{an ancient}} lineage of <b>shorebirds</b> which closely resemble true quail in appearance but are unrelated. They {{are found in}} Africa, Asia and Australia, with one species reaching Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|The ruff is a wader in {{the large}} family Scolopacidae, the typical <b>shorebirds.</b> Recent {{research}} suggests that its closest relatives are the broad-billed sandpiper, Calidris falcinellus, and the sharp-tailed sandpiper, Calidris acuminata. It has no recognised subspecies or geographical variants.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{life on the}} {{shoreline}} includes yellow-crowned night herons, loggerhead shrikes, prairie warblers and <b>shorebirds.</b> Mangrove cuckoos, a notoriously difficult-to-observe species, may be seen at Convoy Point and Black Point. Biscayne {{has one of the}} largest populations of mangrove cuckoos in Florida.|$|E
50|$|The Miranda Naturalists' Trust is a {{charitable}} trust, that established and maintains the Miranda <b>Shorebird</b> Centre, located at Miranda {{on the western}} shore of the Firth of Thames on the North Island of New Zealand. The Miranda Naturalists' Trust (MNT) was formed in 1975 {{to encourage people to}} visit the coastline and appreciate its wide range of flora and fauna. The trust promotes education and public awareness of coastal ecology, <b>shorebird</b> research and conservation. Work done by the trust, to increase knowledge of <b>shorebird</b> migration, includes bird banding, research and data exchange. The <b>Shorebird</b> Centre has information displays on waders and a library and helps raise funds for the trust's work through their shop sales and visitor accommodation.|$|R

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{assessed}} how {{the dynamics of}} wetland bird movements relate to changing resource availability, particularly at more than one spatial scale. Within western Oregon’s Williamette Valley, we examined winter resident Dunlin Calidris alpina movements {{in relation to a}} decrease in availability of preferred <b>shorebird</b> foraging habitat from early to late winter of 1999 – 2000. By tracking movements of 15 (early winter) and 12 (late winter) radiomarked individuals, we calculated home ranges and characterized presence/absence of a preference for <b>shorebird</b> foraging habitat during each winter period. Between periods, we compared: (1) percentage of <b>shorebird</b> habitat in home ranges to its availability in the landscape (regional preference), (2) percentage of radio locations in <b>shorebird</b> habitat to its availability within home ranges (local preference) and (3) relative use of roost sites. Concurrent with a 75 % decrease in available <b>shorebird</b> habitat from early to late winter, average home range sizes increased by a factor of 3. 8. At a regional scale, home ranges in early winter included a significantly greater percentage of <b>shorebird</b> foraging habitat than was available in the wider landscape. However, by late winter, the percent of <b>shorebird</b> habitat in home ranges did not match availability in the landscape. At the local scale, for both winter periods Dunlin were located in <b>shorebird</b> foraging habitat more often than expected given availability of habitat within home ranges [Correction added after online publication 23 May 2008 : sentence amended]. An {{increase in the number of}} roosts used from early to late winter implies possible reliance on additional sites in late winter for foraging opportunities. Results suggest that wet, unvegetated habitat is sought by Dunlin throughout winter, but individuals could not select home ranges in late winter that fully compensated for seasonal loss of habitat...|$|R
5|$|Raptors, songbirds, {{and ground}} birds {{are found in}} the park's grassland, while the Puerco River's {{riparian}} corridor is a good place for year-round residents as well as migrants such as warblers, vireos, avocets, and killdeer. Developed areas around the visitor center and museum attract western tanagers, hermit warblers, house finches, and others. Occasional <b>shorebirds</b> and eastern birds also visit the park.|$|E
5|$|Scolopacidae is a {{large and}} diverse family of small to {{medium-sized}} <b>shorebirds</b> which includes the sandpipers, curlews, godwits, shanks, tattlers, woodcocks, snipes, dowitchers, and phalaropes. Most eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or sand. Different lengths of legs and bills enable multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food.|$|E

They include Aechmophorus grebes, American coot, American white pelican, Anas and Aythya ducks, black-crowned night heron, eared grebes, pied-billed grebes and most likely <b>shorebirds.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{wildlife}} {{can be found in}} and around Matagorda Bay. The Mad Island-Oyster Lake conservation area, located on the eastern shore of Matagorda Bay, is a habitat for over 300 species of birds including songbirds, <b>shorebirds</b> and waterfowl. More species of birds were found in the area than any other in the nation during the National Audubon Society's annual Christmas Bird Count from 2000 to 2002. Other fauna located along the bay include bobcats, white-tailed deer, river otters, Texas horned lizards, reddish egret, white-tailed hawk, peregrine falcon, the piping plover and alligators.|$|E

5|$|At {{low tide}} {{extensive}} areas of mudflats (the Steart and the Berrow Flats) are exposed, providing important feeding and over-wintering grounds for waders (<b>shorebirds).</b> Invertebrate fauna including six nationally rare species and eighteen nationally scarce species {{can be found}} in the ditches and ponds around the shores. Consequently, Bridgwater Bay is a National Nature Reserve, and is managed by Natural England. Some of the potential risks to wildlife are highlighted in the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan.|$|E
5|$|Black Moshannon Lake and the bogs of the Natural Area are {{especially}} important to the IBA. They serve as a stopover for migratory waterfowl and <b>shorebirds.</b> Waterfowl observed at the park include pied-billed and Slavonian grebes, common loon, American black duck, ruddy duck, blue-winged and green-winged teal, tundra swan, long-tailed duck, hooded and red-breasted merganser, greater and lesser scaup, northern pintail, bufflehead, American wigeon, and northern shoveler.|$|E
5|$|Loons and grebes, which nest on lakes but winter at sea, {{are usually}} {{categorized}} as water birds, not seabirds. Although {{there are a}} number of sea ducks in the family Anatidae that are truly marine in the winter, by convention they are usually excluded from the seabird grouping. Many waders (or <b>shorebirds)</b> and herons are also highly marine, living on the sea's edge (coast), but are also not treated as seabirds.|$|E

5|$|Many {{bird species}} migrate to take {{advantage}} of global differences of seasonal temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat. These migrations vary among the different groups. Many landbirds, <b>shorebirds,</b> and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs.|$|E
5|$|Scolopacidae is a {{large and}} diverse family of small- to {{medium-sized}} <b>shorebirds,</b> including the sandpipers, curlews, godwits, shanks, tattlers, woodcocks, snipes, dowitchers and phalaropes. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Different lengths of legs and bills enable multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food. Fourteen species have been recorded in Tasmania, five as vagrants only.|$|E
5|$|Mangroves {{also serve}} as {{excellent}} rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources and the protection offered from most prey. Thousands of birds can nest in the mangroves at once, making a noisy and messy colony, but their droppings fertilize the mangrove trees. <b>Shorebirds</b> like rails, terns and gulls; diving birds such as pelicans and grebes; and birds of prey such as ospreys, hawks and vultures are {{among the more than}} 100 species of birds that use Everglades mangrove trees to raise their young.|$|E

5|$|Massachusetts {{is located}} along the Atlantic Flyway, a major route for migratory {{waterfowl}} {{along the eastern}} coast. Lakes in central Massachusetts provide habitat for many species of fish and waterfowl, but some species such as the common loon are becoming rare. A significant population of long-tailed ducks winter off Nantucket. Small offshore islands and beaches are home to roseate terns and are important breeding areas for the locally threatened piping plover. Protected {{areas such as the}} Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge provide critical breeding habitat for <b>shorebirds</b> and a variety of marine wildlife including a large population of grey seals.|$|E
5|$|Most bogs {{exist in}} glaciated areas, but Black Moshannon State Park {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau. This area was not covered by glaciers during the last ice age. The bogs formed here because of the beds of {{sandstone}} that lie flat, a short distance {{below the surface of}} the earth. The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in them will collect water, as has happened here. The bogs extend the shores of the lake. Migratory <b>shorebirds</b> that visit here include greater and lesser yellowlegs, least sandpiper, solitary sandpiper, and the spotted sandpiper, which has been confirmed as using the IBA as a breeding grounds.|$|E
5|$|Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst {{others have}} {{specially}} adapted brushy tongues {{and in many}} cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and <b>shorebirds</b> with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders. Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.|$|E
