5|$|Sea otters {{were once}} {{numerous}} in <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>Bay.</b> Historical records revealed the Russian-American Company sneaked Aleuts into <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>Bay</b> multiple times, despite the Spanish capturing or shooting them while hunting sea otters in the estuaries of San Jose, San Mateo, San Bruno and around Angel Island. The founder of Fort Ross, Ivan Kuskov, finding otters scarce {{on his second}} voyage to Bodega Bay in 1812, sent a party of Aleuts to <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>Bay,</b> where they met another Russian party and an American party, and caught 1,160 sea otters in three months. By 1817, sea otters in the area were practically eliminated and the Russians sought permission from the Spanish and the Mexican governments to hunt further and further south of San Francisco. Remnant sea otter populations may have survived in the bay until 1840, when the Rancho Punta de Quentin was granted to Captain John B. R. Cooper, a sea captain from Boston, by Mexican Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado along with a license to hunt sea otters, reportedly then prevalent {{at the mouth of}} Corte Madera Creek.|$|E

The road was originally built as a surface road, the Bayshore Highway, and later upgraded to freeway standards.

5|$|Aquatic mammals {{are also}} present in the bay. Before 1825, Spanish, French, English, Russians and Americans were drawn to the Bay Area to harvest prodigious {{quantities}} of beaver, river otter, marten, fisher, mink, fox, weasel, harbor and fur seals and sea otter. This early fur trade, known as the California Fur Rush, was {{more than any other}} single factor, responsible for opening up the West and the <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>Bay</b> Area, in particular, to world trade. By 1817 sea otter in the area were practically eliminated. Since then, the California golden beaver has re-established a presence in the Alhambra Creek. The North American river otter which was first reported in Redwood Creek at Muir Beach in 1996, has since been spotted in the North Bay's Corte Madera Creek, the South Bay's Coyote Creek, as well as in 2010 in <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>Bay</b> itself at the Richmond Marina. Other mammals include the internationally famous sea lions who began inhabiting San Francisco's Pier 39 after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the locally famous Humphrey the Whale, a humpback whale who entered <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>Bay</b> twice on errant migrations in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises have recently returned to the bay, having been absent for many decades. Historically, this was the northern extent of their warm-water species range.|$|E
