40|$|The {{process of}} {{trichlorosilane}} synthesis in fluidized bed reactor (FBR), via hydrochlorination of metallurgical-grade silicon, is usually accompanied with the side-reaction to produce tetrachloride. Many {{efforts have been}} devoted to increase the selectivity of desired product (SiHCl 3) and reduce the formation of tetrachloride (SiCl 4). The two primary reactions involved are both highly exothermic and temperature-sensitive, and the composition of products depends largely on the temperature. However, the temperature distribution during the reaction is often neglected, as FBR is generally considered as temperature homogeneous due to the intense solids mixing and good heat transfer between gas and solids. Actually, for highly exothermic reactions, such as the reaction between metallurgical silicon and hydrogen chloride, the temperature gradient will occur, especially in large-scale reactor. In this case, to further optimize the operation condition and maximize the yield of SiHCl 3, the analysis of temperature distribution throughout the reactor is necessary and meaningful for trichlorosilane synthesis. In this study, a two-dimensional temperature model is proposed for synthesizing trichlorosilane {{in the process of}} <b>solar-grade</b> polycrystalline <b>silicon</b> production.

40|$|Higher {{conversion}} efficiencies {{while reducing}} costs {{at the same}} time is the ultimate goal driving the development of solar cells. Multi-crystalline silicon has attracted considerable attention because of its high stability against light soaking. In case of solar grade multi-crystalline silicon the rigorous control of metal impurities is desirable for solar cell fabrication. It is the aim of this thesis to develop a new manufacturing process optimized for <b>solar-grade</b> multi-crystalline <b>silicon</b> solar cells. In this work the goal is to form solar cell emitters in silicon substrates by plasma immersion ion implantation of phosphine and posterior millisecond-range flash lamp annealing. These techniques were chosen as a new approach in order to decrease the production cost by reducing the amount of energy needed during fabrication. Therefore, this approach is called “Low Thermal Budget” process. After ion implantation the silicon surface is strongly disordered or amorphous up to the depth of the projected ion range. Therefore, subsequent annealing is required to remove the implantation damage and activate the doping element. Flash lamp annealing in the millisecond-range is demonstrated here as a very promising technique for the emitter formation at an overall low thermal budget. During flash lamp annealing, only the wafer surface is heated homogeneously to high temperatures at a time scales of ms. Thereby, implantation damages are annealed and phosphorous is electrically activated. The variation of pulse time allows to modify the degree of annealing of the bulk region to some extent as well. This can have an influence on the gettering behavior of metallic impurities. Ion implantation doping got in distinct consideration for doping of single-crystalline solar cells very recently. The efficient doping of multi-crystalline silicon remains the main challenge to reduce costs. The influence of different annealing techniques on the optical and electrical properties of multi-crystalline silicon solar cells was investigated. The Raman spectroscopy showed that the silicon surface is amorphous after ion implantation. It could be demonstrated that flash lamp annealing at 1000 °C for 3 ms even without preheating is sufficient to recrystallize implanted silicon. The sheet resistance of flash lamp annealed samples is in the range of about 60 Ω/□. Without surface passivation the minority carrier diffusion length in the flash lamp annealed samples is in the range of 85 µm. This is up to one order of magnitude higher than that observed for rapid thermal or furnace annealed samples. The highest carrier concentration and efficiency as well as the lowest resistivity were obtained after annealing at 1200 °C for 20 ms for both, single- and multi-crystalline silicon wafers. Photoluminescence results point towards phosphorous cluster formation at high annealing temperatures which affects metal impurity gettering within the emitter. Additionally, in silicon based solar cells, hydrogen plays a fundamental role due to its excellent passivation properties. The optical and electrical properties of the fabricated emitters were studied with particular interest in their dependence on the hydrogen content present in the samples. The influence of different flash lamp annealing parameters and a comparison with traditional thermal treatments such as rapid thermal and furnace annealing are presented. The samples treated by flash lamp annealing at 1200 °C for 20 ms in forming gas show sheet resistance values in the order of 60 Ω/□, and minority carrier diffusion lengths in the range of ~ 200 µm without the use of a capping layer for surface passivation. These results are significantly better than those obtained from rapid thermal or furnace annealed samples. The simultaneous implantation of hydrogen during the doping process, combined with optimal flash lamp annealing parameters, gave promising results for the application of this technology in replacing the conventional phosphoroxychlorid deposition and diffusion...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the key {{steps in the}} production of high purity (<b>solar-grade)</b> <b>silicon</b> from metallurgical-grade silicon for use {{in the production of}} photovoltaic cells as alternative renewable, environmentally benign and cheap energy source. The initial part of the project involves the development and optimization of a small chemical production platform system capable of producing alkoxysilanes from metallurgical-grade silicon as green precursors to <b>solar-grade</b> <b>silicon</b> production. Specifically, the main aim {{of the study was to}} synthesize trialkoxysilanes in continuous flow mode, although the synthesis on monosilane was also done in batch mode. The alkoxylation reaction was carried out in a traditional slurry phase batch reactor, packed bed flow tubular reactor and also attempted in a continuous flow falling film tubular reactor. The effect of key parameters which affect the silicon conversion and selectivity for the desired trialkoxysilane were investigated and optimized using ethanol as a reagent model. The synthesis was then extended to the other alcohols namely methanol, n-propanol and n-butanol. Copper catalysts which were tested in the alkoxylation reaction included: CuCl, Cu(OH) 2, CuO and CuSO 4. CuCl and Cu(OH) 2 showed comparable activity in the batch mode but the former was more efficient in the packed bed flow tubular reactor. Cu(OH) 2 could be used as a non-halide catalyst but its activity is limited to short reaction cycles (500 oC) resulted in a lower rate of reaction and selectivity than when slightly lower temperatures are used (95 % in batch and > 97 % in flow) and conversion (about 88 % in batch and about 64 % in flow) as compared to all other alcohols studied showing that it could be the most efficient alkoxylation alcohol for this reaction. Overally, the packed bed flow tubular reactor resulted in higher selectivity to trialkoxysilanes than the batch system. Performing the reaction under pressure resulted in increased conversion but selectivity to the desire trialkoxysilane diminished. Synthesis in a continuous flow falling film tubular reactor was not successful as it resulted in very poor conversion and selectivity. Monosilane was successfully synthesized from the disproportionation of triethoxysilane using homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in batch mode. The results obtained from homogeneous catalysis showed that the reaction can be conducted at room temperature. The heterogeneous catalysis method resulted in slow conversion at room temperature but mild heating up to 55 oC greatly improved the reaction. Conducting the reaction under neat conditions produced comparable results to reactions which were carried out using solvents. The disproportionation reaction was best described by the first order kinetic model. The results obtained in this research indicate that the packed bed flow tubular reactor can be utilized with future modifications for continuous flow synthesis of alkoxysilanes as feedstock for the <b>solar-grade</b> <b>silicon</b> production...|$|E
