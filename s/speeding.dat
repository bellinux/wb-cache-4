40|$|In {{the present}} decade along the {{increasing}} trend of using private vehicles, calming the local streets and residential areas has been important for local authorities. There are many unsuccessful experiences of traffic calming implementations because of lacking knowledge and engineered assessment before implementing them. Considering the design <b>speed</b> of traffic, calming measure {{is an essential}} factor to employ these measures. Design <b>speed</b> of different size of <b>speed</b> humps is investigated in previous studies because of its circular shape but for <b>speed</b> tables it is unknown. In this research the design <b>speeds</b> of two common <b>speed</b> tables {{in the city of}} Tehran have been examined, 6. 5 and 8. 5 m <b>speed</b> table. For calculating the design <b>speed</b> of the <b>speed</b> tables, we asked 220 drivers to participate in our experiment by installing a GPS tracker in their vehicles and encouraging them to drive normally. Crossing <b>speeds</b> over 6. 5 and 8. 5 m <b>speed</b> tables have been analysed by collecting totally 220 samples. We pick out 100 correct samples for each <b>speed</b> table and the 85 th percentile <b>speed</b> has been calculated for them, consequently the results of 85 th percentile calculation of the crossing <b>speeds</b> have been proposed as the design <b>speeds.</b> For 6. 5 m <b>speed</b> table, design <b>speed</b> is calculated 41. 5 km/h and for 8. 5 m <b>speed</b> table, design <b>speed</b> is calculated 47. 5 km/h. the comparison of recent findings and past finding of 9. 5 m <b>speed</b> table which is used in Denmark with a design <b>speed</b> of 80 km/h reveals that 1 m increasing with the length of a 6. 5 <b>speed</b> table plateau will result 3 km/h increase in its design <b>speed.</b> The findings of this research can help traffic calming experts to take in consideration of the relation between <b>speed</b> table physical characteristics and its design <b>speed.</b> Furthermore by finding the design <b>speed</b> of <b>speed</b> tables, we can choose suitable <b>speed</b> tables for streets with different <b>speed</b> limits according to the design <b>speed</b> of <b>speed</b> tables...|$|R

The various impacts of <b>speed</b> and the factors affecting drivers’ choice of <b>speed</b> as well as the various <b>speed</b> management measures and tools are discussed. Basic principles of rational <b>speed</b> management are outlined on these grounds. Finally, recommendations for further development of <b>speed</b> management and research needs are formulated.

40|$|Fifty {{percent of}} drives {{have been found}} to {{frequently}} violate <b>speed</b> limits (OECD/ECMT, 2006), and <b>speed</b> limit compliance appears to depend on the perceived credibility of a road’s <b>speed</b> limit (Goldenbeld & van Schagen, 2007). Credibility of <b>speed</b> limits, in turn, appears to be determined by the match between drivers’ <b>speed</b> preferences and the design of the road (Goldenbeld & van Schagen, 2007). Yet, a challenge has been that not all drivers’ prefer the same <b>speeds,</b> and individual differences with regards to <b>speed</b> preference lead to <b>speed</b> variability and <b>speed</b> conflicts in traffic (Elvik, 2010). The aim of this thesis was to explore whether the <b>speed</b> drivers like to drive when motivated by different driving goals (<b>speed</b> preference) correspond to the <b>speeds</b> that they actually drive on those same roads (<b>speed</b> choice). Additionally, this thesis sought to explore the relationship between <b>speed</b> preference and risk perception. Data was collected in two ways, from a <b>speed</b> gun and from a questionnaire. The <b>speed</b> gun collected on-road measures of driving <b>speeds</b> on seven different roads, while the questionnaire collected measures of drivers’ self-reported <b>speed,</b> <b>speed</b> preference and risk perception. For the <b>speed</b> preference measures, participants were asked what <b>speed</b> they would choose on a given road when: 1) motivated by safety, 2) considering fuel savings, or 3) motivated by fun, and additionally 4) what <b>speed</b> they usually drove on the road. In total 200 drivers were interviewed at five different parking lots, and they referred to the seven roads that were sampled with the <b>speed</b> gun. The results indicated that <b>speed</b> preference helped to explain actual driving <b>speeds.</b> More specifically, drivers’ different driving goals and their large individual differences with regards to <b>speed</b> preference corresponded to different <b>speed</b> choices. No relationship was found, however, between drivers’ <b>speed</b> preferences and their risk perceptions. The results are discussed with regards to implications for the problem of <b>speed</b> variability in traffic...|$|R

50|$|The {{standard}} specifies how <b>speed</b> ratings {{should be}} {{reported by the}} camera. If the noise-based <b>speed</b> (40:1) {{is higher than the}} saturation-based <b>speed,</b> the noise-based <b>speed</b> should be reported, rounded downwards to a standard value (e.g. 200, 250, 320, or 400). The rationale is that exposure according to the lower saturation-based <b>speed</b> would not result in a visibly better image. In addition, an exposure latitude can be specified, ranging from the saturation-based <b>speed</b> to the 10:1 noise-based <b>speed.</b> If the noise-based <b>speed</b> (40:1) is lower than the saturation-based <b>speed,</b> or undefined because of high noise, the saturation-based <b>speed</b> is specified, rounded upwards to a standard value, because using the noise-based <b>speed</b> would lead to overexposed images.

40|$|Abstract. The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare <b>speed</b> humps with two newer traffic calming devices that are gaining popularity in the US, the <b>speed</b> slot and <b>speed</b> cushion. Crossing <b>speed</b> and driver behavior were measured at selected traffic calming devices on roadways in the Washington DC metropolitan during the summer of 2003. The subject devices include: • 12 -ft and 22 -ft asphalt <b>speed</b> humps; • 14 -ft prefabricated <b>speed</b> humps; • 22 -ft <b>speed</b> slots; and • 10 -ft <b>speed</b> cushions. All ranged from 2. 5 to 4. 0 inches in height. Video surveillance technology was used to collect data, including vehicle crossing <b>speed,</b> lateral placement and braking frequency. Preliminary results revealed that <b>speed</b> slots allowed the highest average and 85 th percentile crossing <b>speeds.</b> <b>Speed</b> cushions, 12 -ft <b>speed</b> humps and 14 -ft prefabricated <b>speed</b> humps recorded the lowest crossing <b>speed</b> and relatively high frequency of braking maneuvers. The designs of the <b>speed</b> hump and <b>speed</b> cushion encouraged drivers to travel centrally within their lane.
