60|$|CAPT. G. (Aside.) How the dickens should I {{know what}} she prefers? <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> doted on horses. (Aloud.) I think it is.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{was called}} Dian the Beautiful, {{and that she}} belonged to the tribe of Amoz, which dwells in the cliffs above the Darel Az, or shallow sea.|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur is serious?" [...] he inquired. [...] "It {{is only a}} {{short time}} ago that I was talking with Mademoiselle Delora, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was dining with you here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Torrington says so. I asked {{particularly}} who he was, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{his mother}} was some foreigner of high rank." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{called at}} Mrs. Plymdale's this morning, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{he had taken}} the house in St. Peter's Place, next to Mr. Hackbutt's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had {{a letter}} from Miriam {{yesterday}} afternoon," [...] said Dora, [...] "in which <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> her brother Ralph is engaged to Miss Drane." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, she did; <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{could read}} {{all sorts of}} things in my face, and offered, if I would give myself up to it, to make me more than human." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand," [...] said Gilmore. [...] "It's all of no use, {{and you are}} troubling {{yourself}} for nothing. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not care a straw for me;--but she accepted me." ...|$|E
60|$|When Sophy had {{finished}} her tale, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{had left her}} boy in London, and had come down to devote herself to the task she had so long had before her.|$|E
2500|$|When my {{grandmother}} {{found out that}} I was playing jazz {{in one of the}} sporting houses in the District, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I had disgraced the family and forbade me to live at the house.... <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> devil music would surely bring about my downfall, but I just couldn't put it behind me. The cornetist Rex Stewart recalled that Morton had chosen [...] "the nom de plume 'Morton' to protect his family from disgrace if he was identified as a whorehouse 'professor'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was, sir. When she handled {{her silver}} ornament, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I might depend {{on her to}} forget nothing, and {{to be afraid of}} nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{her ability}} was not {{sufficient}} to induce me {{to give up my}} idea. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> after I had known her six months I should detest her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{she did not}} say that. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had {{declined}} the honour that you had offered her;--that she did not regard you as she must regard the man to whom she would pledge her heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I found Anne in a {{state of}} the wildest grief. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had seen Philip shot by the vicomte, just as he was attacking him, and that you in turn had cut down the villain.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} a stranger, Miss Champneyes," [...] Saton said, taking her unresisting hand in his. [...] "I hope {{that you are going}} in to see the Comtesse. Only this morning <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was finding it appallingly lonely." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{everything}} would be arranged for me by Mr. Wickfield, and that I should want for nothing, and gave me the kindest words and the best advice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, papa. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Frederic Aylmer was to {{have all}} her property. She {{explained}} to <b>me</b> everything <b>that</b> she meant to do, and I {{thought that she was}} right." ...|$|R
60|$|To crown my vexation of spirit, Perdita, {{the visionary}} Perdita, seemed to awake to real life with transport, when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the Earl of Windsor {{was about to}} arrive.|$|R
6000|$|... "Three months," [...] ses the nevy. [...] "She {{lives in}} the same street as I do. ’Ow it is she ain’t been snapped up before, I can’t think, but <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> didn’t care for men till she saw me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, I saw her. She had me taken {{upstairs to}} her room. She asked if I was your servant, and when I said yes, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> hoped I would take great care of you. I {{said that was}} my duty.|$|E
6000|$|... "You and Oswald {{were away}} {{together}} when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{had made up}} her mind. Oswald has hardly spoken to her since {{you have been in}} the house. He certainly has not spoken to her about you since you came to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} last night," [...] said I, [...] "that <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I {{was the only}} man in all this earth that she could ever bring herself to love." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he answered, smiling; [...] "my work's out yonder. I couldn't sit idle. I think Miss Gladwyne hit it when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I {{was one of}} the pioneers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was {{thinking}} of her likewise,' said the Earl. 'She spoke truly when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{he might not be}} what I then wished to make him, but something far better.' ...|$|R
60|$|In other {{pictures}} {{there were}} steamships, battleships, submarines, and quaint looking railway trains--all small and antiquated in appearance to me, but wonderful to Victory. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{would like to}} remain {{for the rest of}} her life where she could look at those pictures daily.|$|E
60|$|She obeyed, {{staggering}} a {{few paces}} to a stone at the roadside, behind which she crouched. Afterwards <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had no strength to go further, and indeed no will, since if we were killed, it were better that she who had warned us should be killed also.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray don't get up, Furley," [...] he begged, {{shaking hands}} with him. [...] "I hope you'll forgive such an {{informal}} visit. I met Miss Abbeway on my {{way down to the}} sea, and when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was coming to call on you, I asked leave to accompany her." ...|$|E
60|$|But when Hester {{returned}} {{and found out}} about Hugh she was very angry--and grieved, which hurt <b>me</b> far more. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I had forgotten myself and that Hugh's visits must cease.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw Mrs. Broadwood to-day, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Miss Mowbray {{had gone}} East for the summer. As {{she had spoken}} about staying at Allenwood all the year, Mrs. Broadwood was surprised." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{which has}} assured <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Mr Montague has never behaved badly to me. I shall write {{to him at}} once. If you like I will show you the letter.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How green you are, Mark; and {{not only}} green, but impolite also, to make me repeat {{the story of my}} own disgrace. Of course <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not intend that I should marry my lord, her son; and of course I said that under those {{circumstances}} I should not think of doing such a thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is rather}} a coincidence," [...] he {{admitted}} [...] "She had {{a sort of}} craze to visit some of the places in Paris where it is necessary for a woman to go incognito, and I was always her escort. I heard from her only a few weeks ago, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was coming to London." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We had a {{great deal}} to say to each other. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had been longing to send me a message to warn me that Colonel Kaldhein would {{certainly}} kill me the next time he saw me; but she had no means of sending me such a message, for the Colonel had had her actions closely watched.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{she went}} {{straight}} to her room, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> if I should see you, I was {{to say to you}} that you must come to her there at a quarter to seven." ...|$|R
5000|$|After Morton's {{grandmother}} {{found out}} that he was playing jazz in a brothel, she kicked him out of her house. He said:When my grandmother {{found out that}} I was playing jazz in one of the sporting houses in the District, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I had disgraced the family and forbade me to live at the house. ... <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> devil music would surely bring about my downfall, but I just couldn't put it behind me. The cornetist Rex Stewart recalled that Morton had chosen [...] "the nom de plume 'Morton' to protect his family from disgrace if he was identified as a whorehouse 'professor'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'No,' he replied, alarmed, 'I {{would not}} have her know it for worlds. Only {{yesterday}} <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I reminded her of a fellow she had met at Yarmouth, and my heart was in my mouth.' ...|$|R
