40|$|The {{original}} purpose of measurements {{is to provide}} us with information about a previously unknown physical property of the system observed. In the Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics, this physical meaning of measurement information is not immediately apparent. In order to study the relationship between the Hilbert <b>space</b> <b>coherence</b> of the quantum state and the measurement information obtained in the laboratory, we introduce a generalized measurement postulate for finite resolution measurements.

In this work, we study parallel volume rendering algorithms based on sparse data structures.

To further reduce the processing time, we employ data-parallel volume rendering algorithms based on sparse data structures. Two distinct features of our work are: (a) the sparse data structures enable us to reduce the processing time as well as the memory storage requirement; and (b) parallel processing allows us to further speed up the volume rendering process. Experiments were conducted to assess our proposed scheme. Results show that our proposed data parallel algorithms performed well on two different parallel distributed memory systems...|$|E
40|$|Conditional {{self-organization}} and pattern-formation {{are relevant}} phenomena arising in biological, social, and economical contexts, {{and received a}} growing attention {{in recent years in}} mathematical modeling. An important issue related to optimal government strate-gies is how to design external parsimonious interventions, aiming at enforcing systems to converge to specific patterns. This is in contrast to other models where the players of the systems are allowed to interact freely and are supposed autonomously, either by game rules or by embedded decentralized feedback control rules, to converge to patterns. In this paper we tackle the problem of designing optimal centralized feedback controls for systems of moving particles, subject to mutual attraction and repulsion forces, and fric-tion. Under certain conditions on the attraction and repulsion forces, if the total energy of the system, composed of the sum of its kinetic and potential parts, is below a certain critical threshold, then such systems are known to converge autonomously to the stable configuration of keeping confined and collision avoiding in space, uniformly in time.

40|$|The {{problem of}} slowing down light by orders of {{magnitude}} has been extensively discussed in the literature. Such a possibility {{can be useful in}} a variety of optical and microwave applications. Many qualitatively different approaches have been explored. Here we discuss how this goal can be achieved in linear dispersive media, such as photonic crystals. The existence of slowly propagating electromagnetic waves in photonic crystals is quite obvious and well known. The main problem, though, has been how to convert the input radiation into the slow mode without loosing {{a significant portion of the}} incident light energy to absorption, reflection, etc. We show that the so-called frozen mode regime offers a unique solution to the above problem. Under the frozen mode regime, the incident light enters the photonic crystal with little reflection and, subsequently, is completely converted into the frozen mode with huge amplitude and almost zero group velocity. The linearity of the above effect allows to slow light regardless of its intensity. An additional advantage of photonic crystals over other methods {{of slowing down}} light is that photonic crystals can preserve both time and <b>space</b> <b>coherence</b> of the input electromagnetic wave.

40|$|We {{consider}} the related tasks of matrix completion and matrix approximation from missing data and propose adaptive sampling procedures for both problems. We show that adaptive sampling {{allows one to}} eliminate standard incoherence assumptions on the matrix row space that are necessary for passive sam-pling procedures. For exact recovery of a low-rank matrix, our algorithm judiciously selects a few columns to observe in full and, with few additional measurements, projects the remaining columns onto their span. This algorithm exactly recovers an n × n rank r matrix using O(nrµ 0 log 2 (r)) observations, where µ 0 is a coherence parameter on the column space of the matrix. In addition to completely eliminating any row space assumptions that have pervaded the literature, this algorithm enjoys a better sample complexity than any existing matrix completion algorithm. To certify that this improvement is due to adaptive sampling, we establish that row <b>space</b> <b>coherence</b> is necessary for passive sampling algorithms to achieve non-trivial sample complexity bounds. For constructing a low-rank approximation to a high-rank input matrix, we propose a simple algorithm that thresholds the singular values of a zero-filled version of the input matrix. The algorithm computes an approximation that is nearly {{as good as the}} best rank-r approximation using O(nrµ log 2 (n)) samples, where µ is a slightly different coherence parameter on the matrix columns. Again we eliminate assump-tions on the row space. ...|$|E

The dynamics and the steady-state properties of the system for arbitrary bias are studied using projection operator techniques, which keep track of number of electrons in the system. We show that coherences between system states with different number of electrons, n, (Fock <b>space</b> <b>coherences)</b> do {{not contribute to the}} transport to second order in system-lead coupling. However, coherences between states with the same n may effect transport properties when the damping rate is of the order or faster then the system Bohr frequencies. For large bias, when all the system many-body states lie between the chemical potentials of the two leads, we recover previous results. In the rotating wave approximation (when the damping is slow compared to the Bohr frequencies of the system), the dynamics of populations and the coherences in the system eigenbasis are decoupled. The QME then reduces to a birth and death master equation for populations. Comment: 22 pages, 8 figures, paper accepted in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

40|$|Geometric models {{represent}} {{the shape and}} structure of objects. The mathematical description of geometric models is fundamental for processing virtual objects on digital computers. There are applications {{in a variety of}} fields such as industrial design, architecture, geology, medicine, physical simulation, education and entertainment. Many different representations have been created due to the varying demands in the respective fields. In this thesis, we focus on the rather new point-based representations, where curves and surfaces are described by unstructured point samples which are located on or close to the shapes they define. A point-based geometry representation can be considered a sampling of a continuous curve or surface. A variety of advantages result from the minimal consistency constraints, e. g. restructuring is particularly simple and efficient. However, during shape processing, shape modelling and rendering we need to associate a continuous curve or surface with the input points, in order to access and maintain a consistent model. Inspired by the MLS surface, we present an implicit definition of smooth curves and surfaces defined by points. The implicit function is composed of the local centroid of the input points and a tangent frame, allowing us to describe manifolds of arbitrary dimension. The evaluation can be performed locally by only considering a small subset of the points, when using compactly supported functions for weighting the input points. Our implicit definition allows to gain higher order information about the surface. We show how to compute the gradient and curvature for a location of the shape. We present stable and easy to implement algorithms that allow to locally interrogate the shape. Projection operators - including an orthogonal version - and ray intersection operators efficiently compute points of the manifold. We detail how to employ the ray-surface intersection algorithm for ray casting or ray tracing and discuss corresponding efficiency aspects. We also discuss how to effectively apply spatial data-structures in the context of point-based representations. To further speed up rendering, we present an adaptive sampling strategy that exploits both image- and object <b>space</b> <b>coherence.</b> Despite of the relatively time-consuming ray-surface intersection operator, this allows to interactively investigate the point set surface. In order to take into consideration to the varying complexity of a shape, a feature adaptive approach is required. We suggest to attach individual weighting functions to each sample rather than averaging local scales directly. By using ellipsoidal weighting functions, we also address local anisotropic sampling that adjusts to the principal curvatures of the surface. We modify the basic definition of closed surfaces, also allowing to represent bounded surfaces. Additionally, requiring that any point on the surface is close to the local centroid of the input points yields smooth boundaries. We compare this definition to alternatives and discuss the details and parameter choices. We also show that surfaces might as well be globally non-orientable. Finally, we enhance our manifold definition, also enabling us to describe the more general class of piecewise smooth surfaces - still in the setting of point-based representations. Inspired by cell complexes, we model surface patches, curve segments and points and glue them together based on explicit connectivity information...|$|E
