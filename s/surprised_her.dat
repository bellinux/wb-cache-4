500|$|The writers {{intended}} for the character to make only two guest appearances in the third season, which left Ferris [...] "a bit surprised and [...] " [...] at Ellen's lack of involvement. However, her initial return was scrapped due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, and the actress declined a guest appearance in the finale because the lackluster offer [...] "could cost [...] money and work". The opportunity to return for the fifth season <b>surprised</b> <b>her</b> due to the large time span since her previous appearance. Though she expected her character to eventually die, a devastated Ferris {{was surprised at how}} quickly it occurred. However, after speaking to director Phil Sgricciahe told her that Ellen was the [...] "perfect fodder" [...] for the [...] "kick" [...] that the series needed, and would [...] "go out in a blaze of glory"the actress came to realize that the character's death made sense. Ellen's last words to Dean"Kick it in the ass."was an improvised homage to the late Supernatural executive producer and director Kim Manners, who had died the year before and would often recite the phrase before filming a scene.|$|E

500|$|The {{depth of}} the Queen's grief {{over the death of}} her husband <b>surprised</b> <b>her</b> family, courtiers, {{politicians}} and general populace. As when her mother died, she shut herself off from her family—most particularly, the Prince of Wales, (whom she blamed for her husband's death), with the exception of Alice and Beatrice. Queen Victoria often took Beatrice from her cot, hurried to her bed and [...] "lay there sleepless, clasping to her child, wrapped in the nightclothes of a man who would wear them no more." [...] After 1871, when the last of Beatrice's elder sisters married, Queen Victoria came to rely upon her youngest daughter, who had declared from an early age: [...] "I don't like weddings at all. I shall never be married. I shall stay with my mother." [...] As her mother's secretary, she performed duties such as writing on the Queen's behalf and helping with political correspondence. These mundane duties mirrored those that had been performed in succession by her sisters, Alice, Helena and Louise. However, to these the Queen soon added more personal tasks. During a serious illness in 1871, the Queen dictated her journal entries to Beatrice, and in 1876 she allowed Beatrice to sort the music she and the Prince Consort had played, unused since his death fifteen years earlier.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Eric Kripke's first {{experience}} as director was slated for the twentieth {{episode of the}} season, and Raelle Tucker was scheduled to pen it. Kripke wanted a script that was as [...] "director-proof as possible", but that would [...] "play with structure and really do something different". He shot down every idea the writers pitched to him until Tucker suggested an alternate reality episode. Drawing inspiration from the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode [...] "Normal Again", Kripke was excited by the concept. He felt Dean's definitive moment was {{the death of his}} mother Mary, so the [...] "diversion path" [...] of the new reality would be based on the question, [...] "What if mom never died?" [...] This change allows Sam and Dean to live normal lives, though at the cost of their relationship. The point of the false reality, in Kripke's opinion, was to show that the brothers would not be close if they had not become hunters. The staff tried to persuade him to remove this aspect, but {{he thought it would be}} [...] "lame" [...] for Sam and Dean to have a [...] "7th Heaven relationship". Once the story was fully developed, Tucker was given free rein over the script; this <b>surprised</b> <b>her</b> because she expected Kripke to [...] "be more of a backseat driver than he was".|$|E
500|$|They co-starred in Unforgiven, {{and had a}} daughter, Francesca Eastwood (born Francesca Fisher-Eastwood; August 7, 1993). The {{birth of}} Francesca {{marked the first time}} Eastwood was present for one of his {{children}} being born. Eastwood and Fisher ended their relationship in early 1995, after which Fisher said it took two years to complete what she called the grieving process for her shattered dreams. Before she had moved out of Eastwood's home, he was said to already be dating Dina Ruiz, a television news anchor 35 years his junior whom he had first met when she interviewed him in April 1993. They married on March 31, 1996, when Eastwood <b>surprised</b> <b>her</b> with a private ceremony at a home on the Shadow Creek Golf Course in Las Vegas. The marriage was noted for {{the fact that it was}} only Eastwood's second legal union in spite of his many long-term romances over the decades. Eastwood said of his bride, [...] "I'm proud to make this lady my wife. She's the one I've been waiting for." [...] Ruiz commented, [...] "The fact that I'm only the second woman he has married really touches me." [...] The couple has one daughter, Morgan Eastwood (born December 12, 1996). Ruiz made cameos in two of Eastwood's films, Blood Work and True Crime (in which Fisher even appeared). In the summer of 2012, Dina, Morgan and Francesca starred with the band Overtone in the E! reality-television show Mrs. Eastwood & Company, on which Clint appeared infrequently.|$|E
