50|$|A slurry pit, {{also known}} as a farm slurry pit, slurry tank, slurry lagoon or <b>slurry</b> <b>store,</b> is a hole, dam, or {{circular}} concrete structure where farmers gather all their animal waste together with other unusable organic matter, such as hay and water run off from washing down dairies, stables, and barns, in order to convert it, over a lengthy period of time, into fertilizer that can eventually be reused on their lands to fertilize crops. The decomposition of this waste material produces deadly gases, making slurry pits potentially lethal without precautions {{such as the use of}} a breathing apparatus with air supply.|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{demonstrations of}} three methods (flux sampling, {{external}} tracer ratio, and internal tracer ratio), were mounted in four real farm situations. A flux sampling method was demonstrated at a commercial dairy cow house (slurry-based), at a commercial piggery (straw-based), at a full-scale above-ground cylindrical <b>slurry</b> <b>store</b> (dairy cow slurry) and a full-scale earth-bank lagoon (pig slurry). An external tracer ratio method was demonstrated, {{in parallel with}} the flux sampling method, at the dairy cow house and at the above-ground <b>slurry</b> <b>store.</b> An internal tracer ratio method was demonstrated at the dairy cow house only. At the dairy cow house, the corrected emission rates from the flux sampling method and from the external tracer ratio method agreed to within the estimated experimental range, while the emission rate from the internal tracer ratio method was significantly lower. The overall conclusion {{of the study is}} that all three methods can have a useful role, the choice of which to deploy depending on the particular measurements needed in each case. The paper includes a table (No. 7) which indicates which is the recommended method when each of various considerations has top priority. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{need for}} robust methods for {{measuring}} ammonia emission rates from livestock buildings and manure stores, to guide efforts to abate emissions from livestock farming. This paper reports research to develop and validate three candidate measurement techniques: (a) An external tracer ratio method, where concentrations of ammonia and sulphur hexafluoride are measured downwind of an animal house or manure store. (b) An internal tracer ratio (ITR) method, suited to animal housings, where concentrations of ammonia and sulphur hexafluoride are measured just before air leaves the building. (c) A flux sampler method, which uses sets of passive flux sampling devices positioned so as to intersect all significant flows of air out of an animal house or manure store source. All three of the measurement techniques were validated at a building section simulating a naturally ventilated (space-boarded) cattle house, with the external tracer ratio method also being validated at a simulated <b>slurry</b> <b>store.</b> In the validation tests on the external tracer ratio method the derived ammonia emission rates from the <b>slurry</b> <b>store</b> and cattle house validation studies were 25 % below and 43 % above the measured release rate, respectively. These biases were shown by t-tests to be statistically highly significant, but no clear explanation could be found for the different signs and magnitudes in the two cases. For the ITR method, recovery rates of 78 % and 101 % of released NH 3 were achieved, with low and high release rates, respectively. Validation tests conducted on the flux samplers gave an average of 66 % (standard deviation 2. 9 %) ammonia recovery. The cause of this non-ideal level of recovery has not yet been identified. However, given the low standard deviation, it was concluded that these samplers could be used to measure ammonia emission rates from real farm buildings, provided that a correction factor for the non-ideal recovery was applie...|$|E

40|$|Organic {{farming methods}} are {{claimed to be}} more {{environmentally}} friendly than conventional methods and the EU MIDAIR project had an overall aim to compare emissions from organic dairy farming with conventional methods of milk production. Manure stores are the second largest source of methane emissions (after enteric fermentation) on European dairy farming. The aim of this project was to measure green house gas (GHG) emissions from manures in covered and uncovered <b>slurry</b> <b>stores</b> and farm yard manure (FYM) heaps. The chosen method for measuring these emissions was the tracer ratio method, using sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) as the tracer gas, the limitations of this method prevented successful measurements being made {{on some of the}} stores and a modified method was used on the covered stores. The difference in concentration of the upwind and downwind samples and interfering sources were limiting factors. FYM emission measurements were successful only when the manure was stored indoors. Methane emissions were successfully measured over a 12 month period from the uncovered <b>slurry</b> <b>stores.</b> Emission rates from the uncovered <b>slurry</b> <b>stores</b> on the conventional farm and the organic farm ranged from 14. 4 to 49. 6 and from 12. 4 to 42. 3 g C m(- 3) d(- 1), respectively, with the mean CH 4 emission rates of 35 and 26 g C m(- 3) d(- 1). On both farms, nitrous oxide emissions were close to zero. Methane emissions measured from the indoor organic FYM in summer were 17. 1 g C m(- 3) d(- 1) and the nitrous oxide emission was 411 mg N m(- 3) d(- 1). The covered <b>slurry</b> <b>stores</b> were in such close proximity to other GHG sources that the tracer ratio method was unsuitable and the air-injection method was adopted. The measured emissions from covered <b>slurry</b> <b>stores</b> of CH 4, CO 2 and NH 3 were, respectively, 14. 9 g C m(- 3) d(- 1), 12. 9 g C m(- 3) d(- 1) and 18. 6 mg NH 3 m(- 2) d(- 1) of slurry in February and 12. 0 g C m(- 3) d(- 1), 9. 5 g C m(- 3) d(- 1) and 335 mg NH 3 m(- 2) d(- 1) slurry in March.

40|$|Following {{the demands}} of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) a gap in {{knowledge}} was discovered that the effectiveness of restoration techniques and a combination of restoration techniques at a catchment has yet to be established. The reduction of Diffuse Water Pollution from Agriculture (DWPA) has become a major consideration for catchment managers prompting the creation of Demonstration Test Catchments (DTC) by the Environment Agency (EA) and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to fulfil this research need. Furthermore it is increasingly important for charities such as the West country Rivers Trust (WRT) to create a knowledge base of the effectiveness of their own catchment restoration projects. The Blackwater catchment was identified as a catchment with restoration requirements to prevent it failing the WFD. This small catchment (12 km²) was paired with a control catchment the Kit Brook and used within a Before After Control and Impact (BACI) experimental framework to monitor the effect of restoration (impact) on the water and sediment delivery to the stream. Three restoration techniques were implemented: track removal, stream fencing and <b>slurry</b> <b>store</b> capping. Results indicate (that {{there is little or no}} difference between the catchments, any change may be due to probe fouling, short duration of post restoration period, relatively small amount of restoration works and natural variation. Therefore the results are not discernible from measurement uncertainty. An alternative to this approach in the Absence of sufficient filed data is the use of rainfall run off models. Predicting a possible change in discharge following land management and restoration techniques can be achieved using the Kinematic Erosion Model (KINEROS 2). 5 Management scenarios were developed, Chisel Ploughing, Mechanical Pasture loosening and high density reforestation resulted in a percentage decrease in total and peak discharge whereas low density reforestation and increased livestock numbers resulted in an increase in both peak and total discharge. The results indicate that it is necessary to full understand the mechanical processes behind any restoration technique as the effectiveness of these techniques are very dependent on catchments and how the techniques are implemented...|$|E
40|$|RONO: 2460 5168 Ammonia {{emissions}} from stored farm manures form {{a small but}} significant proportion (? 10 %) of the total emitted annually from UK sources. These emissions are regulated by factors including: the surface area of the store; the storage method; the physical form of the stored manure {{and the source of}} manure. A method was developed to estimate in situ {{emissions from}} a range of store types (weeping wall and earth-banked lagoon) that are currently under-represented in UK emissions estimates. Passive diffusion samplers (Willems Badges) were used to determine vertical concentration profiles to a height of 4. 5 m at a number of locations around each <b>slurry</b> <b>store.</b> An atmospheric dispersion model was applied to estimate the contribution from emissions from other on-farm ammonia sources to the measured data and also to determine the emission rates from the stored manure. A procedure was applied whereby the emission rates from each source were allowed to vary and a numerical equation solver was applied to backfit the modelled data set to the field measurements. Measurements were collected at four farms on a monthly basis throughout the year, with each dataset being collected over 24 h. The uncertainties in the estimates of emissions from the slurry stores during individual measurement periods typically ranged between 20 ? 40 % though higher uncertainties occurred when emission fluxes from the stores were below 0. 25 g NH 3 ?N m? 2 day? 1 and were entrained in the wakes, and mixed with the emissions, of adjacent buildings. The average emission from the farms was 0. 6 g NH 3 ?N m? 2 day? 1 which agrees with other recent data on ammonia emissions from crusted slurry stores and, though it is within the range of data considered in the UK emissions inventory, suggests that emissions from weeping wall stores and earth-banked lagoons may be currently overestimated in national predictionsPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDairy {{production}} systems represent a {{significant source of}} air pollutants such as greenhouse gases (GHG), that increase global warming, and ammonia (NH 3), that leads to eutrophication and acidification of natural ecosystems. Greenhouse gases and ammonia are emitted both by conventional and organic dairy systems. Several studies have already been conducted to design practices that reduce greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions from dairy systems. However, those studies did not consider options specifically applied to organic farming, as well as the multiple trade-offs occurring between these air pollutants. This article reviews agricultural practices that mitigate greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions. Those practices {{can be applied to the}} most common organic dairy systems in northern Europe such as organic mixed crop-dairy systems. The following major points of mitigation options for animal production, crop production and grasslands are discussed. Animal production: the most promising options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the livestock management level involve either the improvement of animal production through dietary changes and genetic improvement or the reduction of the replacement rate. The control of the protein intake of animals is an effective means to reduce gaseous emissions of nitrogen, but it is difficult to implement in organic dairy farming systems. Considering the manure handling chain, mitigation options involve housing, storage and application. For housing, an increase in the amounts of straw used for bedding reduces NH 3 emissions, while the limitation of CH 4 emissions from deep litter is achieved by avoiding anaerobic conditions. During the storage of solid manure, composting could be an efficient mitigation option, depending on its management. Addition of straw to solid manure was shown to reduce CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from the manure heaps. During the storage of liquid manure, emptying the <b>slurry</b> <b>store</b> before late spring is an efficient mitigation option to limit both CH 4 and NH 3 emissions. Addition of a wooden cover also reduces these emissions more efficiently than a natural surface crust alone, but may increase N 2 O emissions. Anaerobic digestion is the most promising way to reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions from storage and land spreading, without increasing NH 3 emissions. At the application stage, NH 3 emissions may be reduced by spreading manure during the coolest part of the day, incorporating it quickly and in narrow bands. Crop production: the mitigation options for crop production focus on limiting CO 2 and N 2 O emissions. The introduction of perennial crops or temporary leys of longer duration are promising options to limit CO 2 emissions by storing carbon in plants or soils. Reduced tillage or no tillage as well as the incorporation of crop residues also favour carbon sequestration in soils, but these practices may enhance N 2 O emissions. Besides, the improvement of crop N-use efficiency through effective management of manure and slurry, by growing catch crops or by delaying the ploughing of leys, is of prime importance to reduce N 2 O emissions. Grassland: concerning grassland and grazing management, permanent conversion from arable to grassland provides high soil carbon sequestration while increasing or decreasing the livestock density seems not to be an appropriate mitigation option. From the study of the multiple interrelations between gases and between farm compartments, the following mitigation options are advised for organic mixed crop-dairy systems: (1) actions for increasing energy efficiency or fuel savings because they are beneficial in any case, (2) techniques improving efficiency of N management at field and farm levels because they affect not only N 2 O and NH 3 emissions, but also nitrate leaching, and (3) biogas production through anaerobic digestion of manure because it is a promising efficient method to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, even if the profitability of this expensive investment needs to be carefully studied. Finally, the way the farmer implements the mitigation options, i. e. his practices, will be a determining factor in the reduction of greenhouse gas and NH 3 emissions...|$|E

40|$|This report {{details the}} {{findings}} of a three year study into the impacts of farm waste stores on groundwater quality. This is a joint project between the British Geological Survey and ADAS and began in April 1997. Funding has been from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Environment, Fisheries and International Science Division, under contract number WA 0517 as part of their ongoing research and development programme into farm wastes. Unlined earth-banked farm slurry stores pose a particular threat to groundwater since recent research suggests that the waste and its constituents is able to leach from the bottom of these stores. After investigating a potential 68 sites, we have undertaken a detailed field programme at 3 sites on the Chalk and 5 sites on the Permo-Triassic Sandstone, the two principal aquifers in the UK, beneath unlined slurry stores. Seven of the sites (2 Chalk and 5 Permo-Triassic) concentrated on unlined cattle slurry lagoons whilst one site examined the effects of a turkey manure store. Boreholes were drilled at an angle of 45 ° so as to obtain material from directly beneath the stores at several of the sites. In addition, a vertical hole was often drilled adjacent to the slurry stores so as to assess the degree of lateral spreading. Vertical boreholes were also drilled through the centre of the turkey litter store since the management of solid manure heaps left a period of the year where the storage area was free from waste. Cores from the boreholes were centrifuged so as to extract the interstitial waters and selected samples were taken for microbial examination. At one Sandstone site and one Chalk site, specially designed gas samplers were installed beneath the slurry lagoons to investigate the aquifer gas composition. Cores taken from beneath the two cattle <b>slurry</b> <b>store</b> Chalk sites showed visual staining from slurry material along fracture faces in the rock. In addition, porewaters from all of the Chalk sites and one of the Sandstone sites showed distinct coloration. These samples showed very high concentrations of nitrate, ammonia, organic carbon, potassium and chloride. The cores taken from beneath two cattle slurry lagoons situated on Chalk exhibited different chemical characteristics with the inference that the least contaminated of these two had formed a sealed base. Gas samplers installed at this Chalk site showed very high rates of denitrification. The physical and chemical properties of the different aquifers were also shown to impact on contaminant movement and attenuation. Microbial studies showed contamination from clostridia in all of the sites studied, however this contamination extended to a depth of 18 m in the two Chalk sites beneath cattle slurry lagoons. Cryptosporidia was found in cattle slurry from five sites, whereas E. coli O 175 was found in cattle slurry from just one of the six sites tested for these pathogens. Neither Cryptosporidia nor E. coli O 157 was found in any of the rock samples taken for microbiological examination. This may however relate to the small sample size and limits of detection rather than their absence. Taking data obtained from the field site investigation, we attempted to model mathematically the impact on local groundwater concentrations {{as a result of a}} leaking farm waste store. Modelling studies showed that concentrations in theoretical nearby production boreholes would be expected to rise only very slightly, typically by 0. 5 mg/L for nitrate. Two maps assessing the risk to the principal aquifers in England and Wales have been generated by overlaying the volume of slurry stored in a given region over the aquifer outline and combining this with either the HOST classification system of soils or the geological drift map. These maps identify the Chalk outcrop of the Dorset and small parts of the Permo-Triassic Sandstone in the West Midlands as the regions most at risk from farm waste stores. Areas with a shallow water table are also considered to be at higher risk to groundwater contamination from unlined slurry lagoons...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Two aspects {{regarding}} the ruminant’s contribution to global methane (CH 4) emissions were investigated: (i) testing {{the accuracy of}} the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change default values for dairy cows fed different diet types and differing slurry storage temperatures; and (ii) providing carbon-isotope (C-isotope) signature data to contribute information on the characteristics of ruminant-derived CH 4 as global source. The experimental diets, fed to 18 dairy cows, were separated into forage-only (hay, C 3 plant) and forage-concentrate diets (barley, C 3 plant; maize, C 4 plant). Accumulated <b>slurry</b> was <b>stored</b> at either 14 or 27 C. The hay diet had the highest CH 4 conversion rate (Ym 7. 9 %). Negligible amounts of CH 4 were emitted from <b>slurries</b> <b>stored</b> at low temperature. No diet effect was found at 27 C (~ 33 L/kg volatile solids). The isotope ratios of enteric CH 4 averaged 67. 7 ‰ (C 3 plants) and 57. 4 ‰ (C 4; maize). High temperature slurry storage resulted in different enrichment factors eCO 2 -CH 4 for maize (33. 2 ‰) and hay (35. 9 ‰). Compared with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change default values for Ym and slurry CH 4 emission the results gained in the present experiment were higher and lower, respectively. Slurry-derived CH 4 was less depleted in 13 C than enteric CH 4, which decreases the usefulness of this signature for global ruminant-derived CH 4...|$|R
5000|$|There is some {{evidence}} to suggest that downstream flood events may become more regular and have higher peak flows due to such land management. However, the trust recognises that agricultural change has been driven by national and international economic drivers which have encouraged intensification, and that farmers are not at fault when it comes to river degradation. The trust works directly with the farming community to try to identify win-win situations that can both improve the condition of river ecology whilst reducing farming costs or saving time. A simple example of this is rerouting clean rain water from <b>slurry</b> <b>stores.</b> This can save irrigation and spreading costs, allowing farmers to utilise animal fertilisers more efficiently and so improve crop yields and reduce runoff to rivers and diffuse pollution. The Association of Rivers Trusts has assisted with this work through the PINPOINT project [...] which, through funding from the Catchment Sensitive Farming Delivery Initiative, has provided training in delivering farm advice.|$|R
40|$|Boreholes {{have been}} {{constructed}} at eight sites on the Permo-Triassic Sandstone and Chalk aquifers to assess the extent of chemical and microbiological contamination emanating from unlined farm manure <b>stores.</b> <b>Slurry</b> along fracture faces in the Chalk was found on cores taken from beneath two stores. Porewaters from the Chalk sites {{and one of the}} Sandstone sites were discoloured and showed high concentrations of nitrate, ammonium and organic carbon to depths in excess of 10 m. Although Cryptosporidia and Escherichia coli O 157 were found in many of the cattle slurry lagoons, neither were found in the aquifer material beneath. The self-sealing of unlined <b>slurry</b> <b>stores</b> is seen as a crucial step in minimizing leakage. A simple mass balance shows farm boreholes near to contaminant sources are at greater risk than public supply wells. Contaminant modelling shows discontinuing use of an unlined farm manure store will lend to little difference in solute concentrations over the short to medium term. Groundwater is most at risk where the water table is shallow since direct hydraulic connection between the lagoon base and the water table considerably increases the rate of vertical migration. This is of greatest significance for pathogens that are thought to be relatively short lived in the subsurface.

Adding the requirement that manure be applied according to a phosphorus standard increases costs proportionately more in Iowa at larger scale levels, but not at all at the smallest scale, and costs in Iowa surpass those in North Carolina at the largest scale. The results of all scenarios underscore the advantages enjoyed by Utah in manure handling because scales of operation there are among the largest. Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|Odor from {{buildings}} where pigs {{are housed}} {{is generated by}} anaerobic fermentation of undigested materials in pig <b>slurry</b> <b>stored</b> for several weeks in pit. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of storage period on the level of odorous compounds in pig slurry and on its bacterial community. A slurry sample (15 L) was taken from the pit of a finisher pig building and incubated in acryl chambers for six- weeks. Slurry for analysis was sampled every two-week. Levels of odorous compounds in the slurry sample were drastically changed after two weeks of storage period; levels of phenols and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were decreased (P< 0. 05), whereas indoles and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) were increased (P< 0. 05). Among dominant bacteria, Bacteroides and Porphyromonadacese_uc_g revealed a strong positive correlation with the levels of phenols and SCFAs. Populations of AC 160630 _g, Acholeplasmatales_uc_g, Mollicutes_uc_g and Cloacamonas_f_uc_g positively correlated with indole and BCFAs content. Taken together, levels of odorous compounds were increased after two weeks of storage, possibly because of changes in the predominant bacterial groups to those that use protein as a carbon source in the hypo-carbohydrate conditions...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the results}} of a {{representative}} survey on farm management parameters relevant for ammonia emissions, a detailed assessment of the ammonia emission abatement potential in Switzerland was perfor-med using the N-flux model DYNAMO. The available statistical data allowed the differentiation of nine different geographical regions and altitudinal zones. In accordance with the present situation, a technically possible and a realistically feasible reduction potential was assessed for different abatement measures. Under the present situation, extended grazing of dairy cattle followed by technical and organisational manure application measures offer the most efficient reduction potential. The reduction potential of cove-ring open <b>slurry</b> <b>stores</b> is relatively low. The overall abatement potential for the combination of the four different abatement strategies results in an estimated realistically feasible reduction of approximately 20 % of the ammonia emissions from livestock. Substantial differences of the abatement potential of measures could be observed between different geographical regions and altitudinal zones. The analysis allows to identify the most effective abatement measures specific for the different geographical regions and altitudi-nal zones and will be used for the preparation of practical recommendations on the most promising abate-ment measures specifically targeted to the different regions...|$|R
40|$|Storage {{and land}} {{application}} of livestock manure causes considerable odor nuisance {{to the surrounding}} neighborhood. Anaerobic digestion and separation of slurry change composition and physical properties of slurry and may therefore lessen the odor pollution during storage and land application. An experiment {{was set up to}} study the effects of anaerobic digestion and separation of slurry on the emission of odor. Odor concentration above treated and untreated slurry was compared during storage and following land application using GC/MS analysis and dynamic dilution olfactometry. Slurry concentrations of malodorous volatile fatty acids were reduced by between 79 to 97 % by anaerobic digestion, while concentrations of malodorous phenolic and indolic odor components above the slurry were reduced by both anaerobic digestion and subsequent separation. Odor concentration in air sampled above <b>slurry</b> <b>stores</b> was slightly reduced by anaerobic digestion; however, odor concentration was found to be higher above stores of anaerobically digested slurry following mixing of the slurry prior to land application. Odor concentration in air sampled above land applied slurry was reduced by 17 % by anaerobic digestion and by 50 % by combined anaerobic digestion and separation...|$|R
40|$|Farm waste {{stores such as}} {{cattle slurry}} lagoons are {{widespread}} in the UK and many overly important aquifers. Stores can be serious risks to water quality because they are important sources of N species, organic C and pathogenic microbes. At two sites on the Chalk aquifer of southern England, inclined boreholes were drilled and cored to obtain aquifer material from directly beneath unlined <b>slurry</b> <b>stores.</b> Vertical boreholes were also drilled adjacent to the <b>slurry</b> <b>stores</b> to determine any lateral movement of contaminants. Interstitial porewaters were analysed for major and minor ions and S isotopes. At the second site, unsaturated zone gases were sampled from the inclined hole. Infiltration of slurry into the unsaturated zone caused significantly elevated concentrations of metals such as Cu and Ni at both sites. Sulphate reduction was occurring at Site 1, as evidenced by SO 4 concentrations decreasing from 150 to 50 mg/l and enhanced ratios of delta(34) S-SO 4 and delta(18) O-SO 4. Ammomum-N also leaches along with dissolved organic C which were found 17 m below ground surface at concentrations up to 400 and 260 mg/l, respectively. Contaminant concentrations were similar in the porewaters from both the inclined and vertical boreholes. At Site 2, higher contaminant concentrations {{were found in the}} inclined borehole compared with the vertical borehole. Organic C concentrations were considerably lower than at Site 1, ranging from 10 to 70 mg/l. Ammonium-N concentrations reached a maximum concentration of 25 mg/l. however NO 3 -N concentrations were up to 500 mg/l and SO 4 concentrations were generally higher than Site 1. Data for N- 2 /Ar and delta(15) N-N- 2 from the gas samplers show a peak of 102 and 2. 2 parts per thousand, respectively. at 14 m below ground level indicating denitrification was taking place. Evidence from delta(34) S- SO 4 and delta(18) O-SO 4 suggest that some SO 4 reduction was taking place simultaneously. From CH 4 and NH 3 detected at depth it is suggested that slurry contamination. emanating from early use of the store, has passed through the top 18 m of the unsaturated zone at Site 2. The presence of high concentrations of NO 3 and lower concentrations of organic C suggests that this lagoon has formed a relatively impermeable seal at its base within {{the first few years of}} its lifetime. The anoxic conditions at both sites may have mobilised U from N-P-K fertilisers. Both sites are continuing to impact on the porewater chemistry and pose a risk of groundwater contamination...|$|R
40|$|<b>Slurry</b> <b>stores</b> are an {{important}} source of both methane (CH 4) and ammonia (NH 3) emissions. Strategies to reduce these emissions include modifying the slurry environment through use of natural and biological additives. In this thesis, two such strategies were explored. The first three experimental chapters explored the potential to mitigate emissions by using inorganic acid (50 % concentrated sulphuric acid H 2 SO 4), fermentable carbohydrates at 10 % w/v to reduce slurry pH, and biological additives (effective microorganisms - EM) at 5 % v/v, to suppress methanogenesis. The addition of a carbohydrate source resulted in ‘self-acidification’ of cattle slurry from average pH 6. 8 to pH’s as low as pH 3. 5 in laboratory and pot-scale experiments, under both warm and cool conditions. The reduced slurry pH inhibited both CH 4 and NH 3 emissions significantly (by between 72 % and 84 % for CH 4, and 57 % and 92 % for NH 3). The use of agriculture food-chain by-products as sources of available carbohydrates, such as brewery spent grains, successfully promoted self-acidification by producing large amounts of lactic acid and reducing the slurry pH to 4. 0. As a result, the greenhouse gas (GHG) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 eq.; CH 4 +CO 2 +N 2 O) emission was inhibited by 86 %. However, NH 3 emissions were not significantly inhibited. Meanwhile, methane oxidation by methanotrophs within slurry crusts was also explored, but bio-augmentation with EM showed no clear effect on this potential CH 4 sink. The application of self-acidified slurry to ryegrass in a pot experiment demonstrated significant NH 3 and CH 4 inhibition compared to the untreated slurry during the first 48 hours after application. However, plant health was severely affected by the acidic slurry treatment, resulting in plant death in most cases. The mechanism for the self-acidification of slurry was elucidated by a conducting a metagenomic analysis of the slurries immediately after carbohydrate addition, {{and at the end of}} the 30 day storage period. This linked the dominance of Lactobacillales in the self-acidified slurry to the high lactic acid production and reduced pH in the treatments that received the carbohydrate source. The metagenomic analysis also identified groups of hydrogenotrophic methanogens of the Order Methanobacteriales, Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales, as the dominant methanogens in both treated and untreated slurries. The low CH 4 emission from the self-acidified slurry was associated with low abundance of methanogens. Whilst this study demonstrated the potential for self-acidification of slurry to reduce CH 4 production and emission, as well as reduction in NH 3 emissions from <b>slurry</b> <b>stores</b> and following land spreading, further research is necessary to test the strategy at a larger scale, and develop methods that minimize the negative effect of the acidified slurry on soil and plant health, e. g. via slurry injection or incorporation...|$|R

40|$|Many rivers across England and Wales are {{experiencing}} excessive inputs of nutrients, faecal waste and sediment from agricultural land. Despite the resulting environmental impacts, {{population growth is}} renewing focus on the intensification of agricultural production to improve food security. As a result, balancing agricultural productivity with resource protection is high on the political agenda, {{and the need to}} assemble improved information on the efficacy of targeted on-farm pollution mitigation measures is key to informing the debate on production versus environmental burden. In England, Demonstration Test Catchments (DTCs) have been established as sentinel, landscape scale experimental facilities for assessing ways to mitigate the problems associated with agricultural pollution of watercourses. As part of the Hampshire Avon/Tamar DTC programme, a research studentship has been used to compile a toolkit of methods, including pollutant source fingerprinting, for testing the effectiveness of on-farm pollution control measures. These measures include: stream bank fencing, riparian buffer strips, ponds and wetlands, farm track re-surfacing, improved <b>slurry</b> <b>stores,</b> and the installation of swales. The toolkit aims to be sustainable, affordable, effective and replicable. This contribution provides a case study of findings and will present data from one experimental on-farm site, following 18 months of intensive monitoring and sampling. The data streams are used to assess the effectiveness of existing mitigation options, as well as providing suggestions for refining those in situ to improve performance...|$|R
40|$|Research on the {{incidence}} {{and effectiveness of}} natural crusting on slurry storage {{as a means of}} ammo-nia emission abatement was undertaken in studies at farm-scale, pilot-scale and on a small-scale. At the farm scale, slurry crusting was found to be commonplace across a large proportion (80 %) of slurry stora-ge facilities. Observations provided information on the impact of a range of factors on the potential for crust formation. The most important factors were slurry solids content (crusting increasing with DM con-tent), volume:surface area ratio of the storage (influencing nature of the crust and rate of formation), lives-tock diet (crusting more likely with grass silage), slurry management (agitation) and, of particular impor-tance, weather conditions with evaporation and rainfall acting on slurry crusts in opposing ways. From measurements at farm and pilot scale, mean ammonia emissions were 0. 48 gNH 3 -N m- 2 d- 1 and 2. 55 gNH 3 -N m- 2 d- 1, for crusted and non-crusted <b>slurry</b> <b>stores,</b> respectively. Where direct comparisons bet-ween crusted and non-crusted slurry were possible, a reduction in NH 3 emission of about 50 % was typical during the measurement period. The results reported here have confirmed the potential for significant aba-tement but need to be demonstrated more consistently under practical farm conditions. The work has also identified potential for a modelling approach for the prediction of crust development and, hence, likely emission abatement efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The study {{tested the}} use of dynamic {{floating}} chambers to measure emissions factors of ammonia (NH 3), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) from <b>stored</b> pig <b>slurry</b> and measured the variations of the emissions in time and space. In 2006, dynamic floating chambers {{were used for the}} continuous measurement of gaseous emissions from two experimental tanks filled with fattening pig <b>slurry</b> <b>stored</b> for two summer months and in a pit filled repeatedly with mixed slurry between October and March. To check the influence of air speed on gaseous emissions, each tank was fitted with a chamber: one operating with an air speed at the surface of the slurry of 0. 01 m/s, the other with a speed of 1 m/s. To ascertain the spatial variability of the emissions, two identical chambers were used for the pit: one was regularly displaced {{across the surface of the}} slurry; the other was fixed throughout the storage period. The measurements obtained were compared with the nitrogen and carbon input-output mass balances of the slurry. The results show that the measured gaseous emissions explain from 4 to 38 % of the total nitrogen losses and from 61 to 285 % of the total carbon losses. The use of such dynamic floating chambers is not an appropriate method to evaluate the gaseous emission factors from slurry storage. The kinetics of the emissions underline the importance of measurement periods and their duration to measure emission factors...|$|R
40|$|Measurement {{of ammonia}} {{emission}} were performed from pig and cattle slurry storage and from manu-re heaps. Measurement from <b>slurry</b> <b>stores</b> were performed {{by means of}} a specific system consisting of a 0. 138 m 2 captor, a trap containing 400 ml of a 1 % boric acid solution, a vacuum pump, an interceptor trap, a volume meter and a flow-meter. The device is arranged to suck the air from the funnel with a flow rate of 9 l/min. The ammonia present in air is then fixed by the boric acid solution into ammonium borate and its concentration can be rapidly determined by titration with 0, 1 N Sulfuric acid. The captors were moun-ted on a special polystyrene and wooden floating frame and placed on the slurry surface. The captors are let free to float on the slurry surface so that the area subjected to the measurement changes continuously. Measurements of ammonia emission from manure heaps were performed by means of Open Large Dynamic Chamber. Trials, carried out along the four seasons with cattle (8 - 10 %TS) and pig (3 - 4 % TS) slurry, pointed out ammonia losses up to 1. 6 g NH 3. m 2 and 2. 5 g NH 3. m 2 per day respectively. First results of ammonia emission measured from FYM heaps (autumn and winter) showed average emission close to 3. 3 g NH 3 m 2 per day corresponding to losses ranging from approximately 5. 4 % to 9. 4 % of heaps TKN...|$|R
