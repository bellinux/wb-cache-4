In this model, the Southern hake (Merluccius merluccius) represents the predator, and the <b>blue</b> <b>whiting</b> (Micromesistius poutassou) is the prey. <b>Blue</b> <b>whiting</b> is the hake’s main prey in the study area, and it represents about 40 % of the Southern hake diet. Both the predator and prey population dynamics follow the Lotka-Volterra formulation, and population dynamics are assumed as logistic, with two interaction coefficients: α is the effect of a unit change in the prey on the percent growth rate of the predator and β is the attack rate or searching efficiency of the predator. The populations interact randomly in proportion to population density. Logistic predator-prey equations were applied to the <b>Southern</b> hake and <b>blue</b> <b>whiting</b> stocks, including biomass, intrinsic rates of growth, carrying capacity and capture for both species.

Historical fishery and biological data series available from IEO (1988 onwards) were used to describe and quantify patterns and spatio-temporal changes in catches and discards in the hake fishery. Data were collected by scientific observers on board Spanish fishing vessels operating in the study area. Data collected on fishing activity included effort, catches and discards of target and non-target species on a haul-by-haul basis. Biological information (size, sex, maturity, etc) on target species was recorded on a daily basis, while biological data on non-target species was recorded periodically. The “discards ratio” was calculated by each haul, defined as the total weight of fish discarded divided by the total catch weight.
