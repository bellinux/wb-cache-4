5|$|In {{that year}} he rebelled against Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491–518), whose fiscal <b>stringency</b> and {{promotion}} of Miaphysitism were widely unpopular, and allowed Vitalian to quickly win over {{large parts of the}} army and the people of Thrace to his cause. After scoring a series of victories over loyalist armies, Vitalian came to threaten Constantinople itself, and forced Anastasius to officially recant his adoption of Miaphysitism in summer 515. Soon after, however, as Anastasius failed to honour some of the terms of the agreement, Vitalian marched on Constantinople, only to be decisively defeated by Anastasius' admiral, Marinus.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} Canada's role in the Afghanistan War, {{concerns}} were raised about the <b>stringency</b> of the criteria {{that needed to be}} met to receive the Victoria Cross. Other countries with a Victoria Cross had awarded it numerous times {{since the end of the}} Second World War, some members of the Australian, New Zealand, and British armed forces receiving the decoration for their actions during the Afghan and Iraq wars of the 2000s. Members of the Canadian Armed Forces questioned why some actions by Canadians were deemed worthy only of the Star of Military Valour; citations for individuals who'd received the imperial Victoria Cross during the First World War were very similar to those for Canadians who were presented with the Star of Military Valour during the war in Afghanistan. This led then Chief of the Defence Staff, Walter Natynczyk, to create a special committee to review the matter. The Department of National Defence's Directorate of Honours and Recognition explained concepts of war had changed since the mid-20th century and Canada had also developed a more elaborate honours system.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} defilement and cutting of hair had a <b>stringency</b> that {{products}} of the vine did not, as defilement and cutting of hair rendered void the previous period of nazirite observance, while consuming {{products of the}} vine did not. Products of the vine had a <b>stringency</b> that defilement or cutting of hair did not, as the prohibition of products of the vine had no exception, while the law allowed exceptions for where cutting of hair was a religious duty or where there was an abandoned corpse. Defilement also had a <b>stringency</b> that cutting of hair did not, as defilement rendered void {{the whole of the}} preceding period and entails the offering of a sacrifice, while cutting of hair renders voided only 30 days and did not entail a sacrifice.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Clustering the ESTs {{from a large}} dataset {{representing}} a single species is a convenient starting point {{for a number of}} investigations into gene discovery, genome evolution, expression patterns, and alternatively spliced transcripts. Several methods have been developed to accomplish this, the most widely available being UniGene, a public domain collection of gene-oriented clusters for over 45 different species created and maintained by NCBI. The goal is for each cluster to represent a unique gene, but currently it is not known how closely the overall results represent that reality. UniGene's build procedure begins with initial mRNA clusters before joining ESTs. UniGene's results for soybean indicate a significant amount of redundancy among some sequences reported to be unique mRNAs. To establish a valid non-redundant known gene set for Glycine max we applied our algorithm to the clustering of only mRNA sequences. The mRNA dataset was run through the algorithm using two different matching <b>stringencies.</b> The resulting cluster compositions were compared {{to each other and to}} UniGene. Clusters exhibiting differences among the three methods were analyzed by 1) nucleotide and amino acid alignment and 2) submitting authors conclusions to determine whether members of a single cluster represented the same gene or not. Results Of the 12 clusters that were examined closely most contained examples of sequences that did not belong in the same cluster. However, neither the two <b>stringencies</b> of PECT nor UniGene had a significantly greater record of accuracy in placing paralogs into separate clusters. Conclusion Our results reveal that, although each method produces some errors, using multiple <b>stringencies</b> for matching or a sequential hierarchical method of increasing <b>stringencies</b> can provide more reliable results and therefore allow greater confidence in the vast majority of clusters that contain only ESTs and no mRNA sequences. </p...|$|R

25|$|The {{basic model}} of CRISPR {{evolution}} is newly incorporated spacers driving phages to mutate their genomes {{to avoid the}} bacterial immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations.

Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer. Similar <b>stringency</b> is required in PAM or the bacterial strain remains phage sensitive.|$|E
25|$|According to Professor David C. Kraemer, its {{incorporation}} into Jewish law codes {{stems from the}} confusion of rabbis over the duration of menstrual cycles.

On a related point, {{on the origin of}} the custom to wait extra days, Kraemer opines that the <b>stringency</b> initiated in Talmudic times was thought out as a means of birth control.|$|E

25|$|Thus, in general, the {{commonly}} perceived {{differences between the}} two tests relate to the <b>stringency</b> and the perspective of the inquiry the court takes when applying each test.

25|$|During the 1990s, the {{financial}} <b>stringency</b> felt throughout {{the armed forces}} made its mark on the Air Forces as well. Pilots and other personnel could sometimes not get their wages for months, and on occasion resorted to desperate measures: four MiG-31 pilots at Yelizovo in the Far East went on hunger strike in 1996 to demand back pay which was several months overdue, and the problem was only resolved by diverting unit money intended for other tasks.

25|$|The most {{successful}} mixed cut is the Princess cut, first introduced in 1960 by A. Nagy of London.

Its higher fire and brilliance compared to other mixed cuts is one reason for the Princess cut's popularity, but more importantly is the fact that, of all the diamond cuts, it wastes the least of the original crystal. Another beautiful cut is the Flanders cut, a modified square with cut corners, brilliant facets and is currently being cut by cutters at Russian Star.|$|E

Science should seek for theories that are most probably false on the one hand (which is the same as saying that they are highly falsifiable and so there are lots of ways that they could turn out to be wrong), but still all actual attempts to falsify them have failed so far (that they are highly corroborated).|$|E
40|$|The cDNA-chip {{technology}} is a highly versatile tool for the comprehensive analysis of gene expression at the transcript level. Although it has been applied successfully in expression profiling projects, there is an ongoing dispute concerning the quality of such expression data. The latter critically depends on the specificity of hybridisation. SAFE (specificity assessment from fractionation experiments) is a novel method to discriminate between non- specific cross-hybridisation and specific signals. We applied in situ fractionation of hybridised target on DNA-chips by means of repeated washes with increasing <b>stringencies.</b> Different fractions of hybridised target are washed off at defined <b>stringencies</b> and the collected fluorescence intensity data at each step comprise the fractionation curve. Based on characteristic features of the fractionation curve, unreliable data can be filtered and eliminated from subsequent analyses. The approach described here provides a novel experimental tool to identify probes that produce specific hybridisation signals in DNA-chip expression profiling approaches. The iterative use of the SAFE procedure will result in increasingly reliable sets of probes for microarray experiments and significantly improve the overall efficiency and reliability of RNA expression profiling data from DNA-chip experiments...|$|R
