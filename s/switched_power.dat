50|$|A {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} (switching-mode power supply, switch-mode power supply, <b>switched</b> <b>power</b> supply, SMPS, or switcher) is an electronic power supply that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently. Like other power supplies, an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source (often mains power) to DC loads, such as a personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a linear power supply, the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Ideally, a {{switched-mode power supply}} dissipates no power. Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time. In contrast, a linear power supply regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor. This higher power conversion efficiency is an important advantage of a switched-mode power supply. Switched-mode power supplies may also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply due to the smaller transformer size and weight.|$|E

40|$|Techniques are {{developed}} for the approximate representation of switched dc-dc converters by time-averaged models. Simple analytical expressions {{in terms of the}} circuit components are derived for the characteristic transient and frequency responses of averaged power-stage models for use in designing and understanding the behavior of the actual <b>switched</b> <b>power</b> stages. High-order systems can be analyzed by the averaging technique without a commensurate increase in complexity. Two functional blocks are necessary to construct a switched converter: the switch controller, which is relatively well understood, and the power stage. When concreteness is necessary, a particular pulse- width modulator is chosen for the switch controller and is thoroughly analyzed. The output of representative power stages (buck, boost, and buck-boost) is a complicated nonlinear function of the switch controller and source input, and since conventional methods of nonlinear analysis are shown to be intractable or uninterpretable, attention is focused on the challenge of obtaining useful design equations. The difficulty encountered in the nonlinear analysis of <b>switched</b> <b>power</b> stages is successfully surmounted by the semiheuristic development of a continuous power-stage model. Since the characteristic response times of state variables in the <b>switched</b> <b>power</b> stage are invariably large with respect to the switching period, discontinuous forcing functions in the equivalent circuits are averaged over a time interval comparable with the switching period without appreciably affecting the nature of the response. Consequently, the averaged model is limited to response times greater than the averaging interval. Equivalent circuits and analytic expressions for the transient and frequency response of each power-stage type are then derived from the averaged models. A linearized control-input transfer function, obtained for small amplitude variations of the averaged control, reveals a dependence of effective circuit component values upon the switch duty ratio, and the possible existence of a positive real zero. The unusual behavior predicted above is confirmed by an analog computer simulation of both the switched and averaged power stages. It is also shown experimentally that closed-loop stability of the <b>switched</b> <b>power</b> stage is adequately predicted by the averaged model. The averaging technique is thus a powerful analytical tool for exposing inherent characteristics of switched circuits. ...|$|E
