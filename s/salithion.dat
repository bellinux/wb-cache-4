50|$|Cases of {{dermatitis}} {{caused by}} pesticide exposures, tabulated by the Division of Dermatology, Saku Central Hospital, Japan, from 1975 to 2000 are described. Dermatitis cases gradually decreased from 1975 to 2000, presumably accelerated by the phase-out of dermatitis-causing pesticides, including difolatan fungicide and <b>salithion,</b> an organophosphorous insecticide. Cases of chronic and solar dermatitides gradually decreased, {{which may be}} explained by reductions in the use of allergenic or photosensitive sulfur agents and organophosphates. However, the ratios of chemical burns from irritant pesticides—calcium polysulfide, dazomet, methyl bromide, chlorpicrin, paraqat/diquat, organophosphorus, quintozene, and glyphosate—rose in those years. Chemical burns from calcium polysulfide were responsible for most of the severe cases.|$|E
40|$|Optimum {{condition}} in {{the synthesis of}} MTBO was found by the examination and improvement of thiono-thiol isomerization of <b>salithion.</b> For the isomerization of <b>salithion</b> were used acetone as the solvent, sodium iodide as the catalyst, potassium carbonate as the acceptor of iodide ion, and methyl iodide as the methylating agent. MTBO was crystallized from ether to give pure crystals which are stable on storage for a long time. <b>Salithion</b> was readily demethylated by potassium dimethyldithiocarbamate to give potassium saligenin cyclic phosphorothioate (KSCP). KSCP was S-methylated by methyl iodide to give MTBO in high yield...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the dependence of the anti-acetylcholinesterase, insecticidal activities and hydrolysis rate upon the substituents at the phosphorus atom and p-position relative to the phenyl ester group of saligenin cyclic phosphorothionates and phosphates, regression analysis was applied to the representative <b>salithion</b> (2 -methoxy- 4 H- 1, 3, 2 -benzodioxaphosphorin 2 -sulfide) and salioxon (2 -methoxy- 4 H- 1, 3, 2 -benzodioxaphosphorin 2 -oxide) analogs. For the insecticidal activity of <b>salithion</b> analogs, steric parameter was important in transport process of the compounds to the biological site of action {{as well as in the}} interaction with the site : the smaller the substituent at the phosphorus atom and the p-position, the more potent the insecticidal activity. Whereas for the insecticidal activity and hydrolysis rate of salioxon analogs, electronic nature was important : the more electronegative the phosphorus atom, the more potent the insecticidal activity and the more contributes the substituent at the phosphorus atom in resonance, the more resistant to the hydrolysis. For the anti-acetylcholinesterase activity of salioxon analogs, hydrophobic nature was important : the less hydrophobic the substituent at the phosphorus atom, the more potent the anti-acetylcholinesterase activity...|$|E
40|$|Several saligenin cyclic phenylphosphonothionates were {{synthesized}} {{and examined}} for nematocidal activity against Aphelenchoides besseyi Christie. 2 -p-Tolyl- 4 H- 1, 3, 2 -benzodioxaphsphorin- 2 -sulfide {{was the strongest}} nematocide in the tested compeunds including the analogous insecticide <b>salithion</b> (2 -methoxy- 4 K- 1, 3, 2 -benzodioxaphosphorin- 2 -sulfide) and 2 -methylamino- 4 H- 1, 3, 2 -benzodioxaphosphorin- 2 -oxide which has been evaluated {{to be an effective}} nematocide against Rhabditis. サリゲニン環状フェニルチオノホスホン酸エステル類数種を合成し,稲心枯線虫に対する効果を検討した. 2 -p-トリル- 4 H- 1, 3, 2 -ベンゾヂオキサホスホリン- 2 -スルフィドが最も強い殺線虫活性を示し,類縁化合物の殺虫剤サリチオンおよびRhabditisに対し著効を有する 2 -メチルアミノ- 4 H- 1, 3, 2 -ベンゾジオキサホスホリン- 2 -オキシドよりも優れていた...|$|E
