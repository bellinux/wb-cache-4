5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} can be {{seen from}} a variety of viewpoints. A synthesized research definition of cognitive flexibility is a <b>switch</b> <b>in</b> thinking, whether that is specifically based on a <b>switch</b> <b>in</b> rules or broadly based on a need to switch oneâ€™s previous beliefs or thoughts to new situations. Moreover, it refers to simultaneously considering multiple aspects of thought at once, whether they be two aspects of a specific object, or many aspects of a complex situation. Other terms for and components of cognitive flexibility include mental flexibility, mental set shifting, cognitive shifting, task switching/shifting, and attention switching/shifting.|$|E

40|$|This article {{finds the}} close {{relationship}} between long memory and some forms of Markov-switching models. The simulation results suggest: (1) when the transition probabilities are closer to unity, {{it is more likely}} to generate long memory process; (2) magnitude of regime-switching {{plays an important role in}} generating long memory; and (3) process with <b>switching</b> <b>in</b> variance (disturbance) is much less likely to explain long-memory process than <b>switching</b> <b>in</b> mean (intercept) and autoregressive coefficient. Therefore, given the observed high persistence in financial volatility data, volatility modelling by <b>switching</b> <b>in</b> mean and AR coefficient is preferred to that by <b>switching</b> <b>in</b> variance. ...|$|R

5|$|Sexual {{intercourse}} is {{the major}} mode of HIV transmission. Both X4 and R5 HIV {{are present in the}} seminal fluid, which is passed from a male to his sexual partner. The virions can then infect numerous cellular targets and disseminate into the whole organism. However, a selection process leads to a predominant transmission of the R5 virus through this pathway. In patients infected with subtype B HIV-1, there is often a co-receptor <b>switch</b> <b>in</b> late-stage disease and T-tropic variants appear that can infect a variety of T cells through CXCR4. These variants then replicate more aggressively with heightened virulence that causes rapid T cell depletion, immune system collapse, and opportunistic infections that mark the advent of AIDS. Thus, during the course of infection, viral adaptation to the use of CXCR4 instead of CCR5 may be a key step in the progression to AIDS. A number of studies with subtype B-infected individuals have determined that between 40 and 50 percent of AIDS patients can harbour viruses of the SI and, it is presumed, the X4 phenotypes.|$|E

Currently the largest professional tournament is the GSL (GomTV Star League) which is a monthly tournament held in South Korea.

A new North American StarCraft League was announced on February 21, 2011 and is scheduled for an initial run of three seasons offering $400,000 in prize money. The first season of the North American Star League started on April 12, 2011, with 50 players divided into 5 divisions. It ended on July 10, 2011, and the total prize pool was US$100,000. The North American Star League has since run for an additional season, with a fifth starting in early 2013. On May 2, 2012, Ongamenet and KeSPA announced a formal <b>switch</b> <b>in</b> StarCraft competition from Brood War to StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty.
