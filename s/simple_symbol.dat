When two additional groups joined the wing in April 1944, the wing then identified its groups by a letter Y on the uppermost area of the tail fin, superimposed on the symbol previously used (in a manner similar to the system used by the Eighth) with the new 463rd BG using a cone-shaped device and the 483rd BG a five-pointed star that was displayed below the Y instead of underlying it.|$|E

2500|$|Shelton's system {{became very}} popular and {{is well known}} because it was used by Samuel Pepys for his diary and for many of his {{official}} papers, such as his letter copy books. It was also used by Sir Isaac Newton {{in some of his}} notebooks. Shelton borrowed heavily from his predecessors, especially Edmond Willis. Each consonant was represented by an arbitrary but <b>simple</b> <b>symbol,</b> while the five vowels were represented by the relative positions of the surrounding consonants. Thus the symbol for B with symbol for T drawn directly above it represented [...] "bat", while B with T below it meant [...] "but"; top-right represented [...] "e", middle-right [...] "i", and lower-right [...] "o". A vowel {{at the end of a}} word was represented by a dot in the appropriate position, while there were additional symbols for initial vowels. This basic system was supplemented by further symbols representing common prefixes and suffixes.|$|E

What was it?").|$|E

50|$|Before {{chemistry}} {{became a}} science, alchemists had designed arcane symbols for both metals and common compounds.

50|$|In 1988 the Principal Susan Monks, in {{conjunction}} with the School Council, initiated a search for a school logo. The brief was to have a <b>simple</b> <b>symbol</b> which reflected some aspect of Hallett Cove and the school. After a number of weeks and a large variety of ideas, the staff and parent bodies finally settled on our current design. It was designed by Art teacher, Dave Smith. The horizontal lines represent both the sea and the geological strata of the Hallett Cove Conservation Park and the sun as a symbolic reference to youthful aspirations as well as the visual beauty of our ocean view in the late afternoon.|$|E

50|$|In the Americas these European systems {{continued}} with English tradition {{being used in}} the New England Colonies and spread outwards with the western expansion of the U.S. The Spanish system evolved from the south with the vaquero tradition in what today is the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The branding iron consisted of an iron rod with a <b>simple</b> <b>symbol</b> or mark which was heated in a fire. After the branding iron turned red-hot, the cowhand pressed the branding iron against the hide of the cow. The unique brand meant that cattle owned by multiple owners could then graze freely together on the commons or open range. Drovers or cowboys could then separate the cattle at roundup time for driving to market.|$|E
