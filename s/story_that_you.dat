This allowed you to suspend your doubt of the supernatural until you were so thoroughly into the <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could accept it almost without noticing...It's not until Grady, the ghost of the former caretaker who axed to death his family, slides open the bolt of the larder door, allowing Jack to escape, that you are left with no other explanation but the supernatural.|$|E
500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review and awarded it three stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's balance {{of humor and}} horror, noting [...] "Although 'Leonard Betts' is not a comedy, the three writers take such pleasure in the <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> buy the situation. There's a lot of situational (and scary) humor in the script." [...] Furthermore, she noted that the ending revelation that Scully has cancer and the following conversation between Mulder and Scully was [...] "one of the season's best scenes." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote positively of the [...] "amiable quality to the story which makes its finale moments all the more of {{a kick in the}} teeth." [...] Shearman and Pearson noted that [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] was the first episode [...] "to come along [...] which feels light and frothy, and it deliberately makes the unkindest cut of all." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} Dreamcast release Skies of Arcadia received {{critical acclaim}} from game reviewers. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, {{the game has}} an average score of 93 out of 100, which indicates [...] "universal acclaim" [...] based on 21 reviews. GameRankings, pulling from {{a higher percentage of}} reviews, tracked it slightly lower, at 90% out of 40 reviews. IGN praised it for being [...] "One of the most solid games visually on the Dreamcast" [...] and concluded that [...] "There's so much to explore, so much character, and a great <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't mind being retold again". GameSpot gave the game a 9.2 as well, praising the visuals, stating that they were [...] "some of the most painstakingly detailed ever seen in a role-playing game". As a whole, GameSpot concluded that the game [...] "lives up [...] the high expectations". Game Informer listed it {{as one of the top}} 10 Dreamcast games. Despite the generally positive reviews, many critics did criticize that it was sometimes difficult to explore the game's world due to the game's high rate of random encounter-based battles frequently disrupting progress. Despite this, in a 2017 retrospective from Metacritic on the highest rated exclusive games (at time of release) per platform, Skies of Arcadia placed third for the Dreamcast, behind Soul Caliber and Jet Grind Radio.|$|E
