5|$|The <b>Svalbard</b> Treaty of 1920 recognizes Norwegian sovereignty, and the 1925 <b>Svalbard</b> Act made <b>Svalbard</b> a full {{part of the}} Kingdom of Norway. The {{archipelago}} is administrated by the Governor of <b>Svalbard,</b> {{which is}} subordinate to the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and the Police. Unlike the rest of Norway (including Jan Mayen), <b>Svalbard</b> is a free economic zone and a demilitarized zone, and {{is not part of}} the Schengen Area nor the European Economic Area.|$|E
5|$|The islands {{were first}} taken into {{use as a}} whaling base in the 17th and 18th centuries, after which they were abandoned. Coal mining started at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, and several permanent communities were established. The <b>Svalbard</b> Treaty of 1920 recognizes Norwegian sovereignty, and the 1925 <b>Svalbard</b> Act made <b>Svalbard</b> a full part of the Kingdom of Norway. They also established <b>Svalbard</b> as a free economic zone and a demilitarized zone. The Norwegian Store Norske and the Russian Arktikugol remain the only mining companies in place. Research and tourism have become important supplementary industries, with the University Centre in <b>Svalbard</b> (UNIS) and the <b>Svalbard</b> Global Seed Vault playing critical roles. No roads connect the settlements; instead snowmobiles, aircraft and boats serve inter-community transport. <b>Svalbard</b> Airport, Longyear serves as the main gateway.|$|E
5|$|Longyearbyen School serves ages 6-18. It is {{the primary}} and {{secondary}} school in the northernmost location on Earth. Once pupils reach ages 16 or 17 most families move to mainland Norway. There is a non-degree offering tertiary educational institution in Longyearbyen, University Centre in <b>Svalbard</b> (UNIS), the tertiary school in the northernmost location on Earth, co-located with the Norwegian Polar Institute, the <b>Svalbard</b> Museum, and the <b>Svalbard</b> Science Forum.|$|E
5|$|<b>Svalbard</b> Airport in <b>Svalbard,</b> Norway is the northern-most {{airport to}} which {{tourists}} can book tickets. It is primarily used for transporting miners {{to and from}} a cluster of islands with a heavy mining industry.|$|E
5|$|<b>Svalbard</b> and Jan Mayen {{constitute}} two {{outlying areas}} of Norway. <b>Svalbard</b> is an archipelago in the Arctic about midway between mainland Norway and the North Pole. The group of islands ranges from 74° to 81° north latitude, and from 10° to 35° east longitude. The <b>Svalbard</b> Treaty of 1920 recognizes Norwegian sovereignty, and the 1925 <b>Svalbard</b> Act established administration by the appointed Governor of <b>Svalbard.</b> Jan Mayen is a volcanic {{island in the}} Arctic Ocean located at {{the border of the}} Norwegian Sea and the Greenland Sea. Since 1994, the island has been administrated by the County Governor of Nordland, with some authority delegated to the station commander.|$|E
5|$|<b>Svalbard</b> is an {{archipelago}} in the Arctic Ocean {{under the}} full sovereignty of Norway, but {{is subject to}} the special status granted by the <b>Svalbard</b> Treaty. Jan Mayen is a remote island in the Arctic Ocean; it has no permanent population and is administrated by the County Governor of Nordland. <b>Svalbard</b> and Jan Mayen have in common that they are the only integrated parts of Norway not allocated to counties. While a separate ISO code for <b>Svalbard</b> was proposed by the United Nations, it was the Norwegian authorities who took initiative to include Jan Mayen in the code. Its official language is Norwegian.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Svalbard</b> Treaty of 1920 {{established}} full Norwegian {{sovereignty over}} the archipelago. The islands are, unlike the Norwegian Antarctic Territory, {{a part of}} the Kingdom of Norway and not a dependency. The treaty came into effect in 1925, following the <b>Svalbard</b> Act. All forty signatory countries of the treaty have the right to conduct commercial activities on the archipelago without discrimination, although all activity is subject to Norwegian legislation. The treaty limits Norway's right to collect taxes to that of financing services on <b>Svalbard.</b> Therefore, <b>Svalbard</b> has a lower income tax than mainland Norway, and there is no value added tax. There is a separate budget for <b>Svalbard</b> to ensure compliance. <b>Svalbard</b> is a demilitarized zone, as the treaty prohibits the establishment of military installations. Norwegian military activity is limited to fishery surveillance by the Norwegian Coast Guard as the treaty requires Norway to protect the natural environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{vegetation}} on {{both sides}} of the fjord is High Arctic steppe, which is characterized by grasses. It is caused by extremely low precipitation, basic earth with salt deposits in the surface, and large areas of exposed mineral earth. The area around the fjord has a unique vegetation, which has not preserved in other areas of <b>Svalbard.</b> Along with vegetation found on nesting cliffs, it is the most exclusive flora in <b>Svalbard.</b> There are several unique species in the national park, including , which is featured in the national park's logo and for which <b>Svalbard</b> is the only known location in Europe, Puccinellia svalbardensis, Gentianella tenella and Kobresia simpliciuscula. There is breeding ground for pink-footed goose within the park, although <b>Svalbard</b> ptarmigan can also be found. Animals that can be found in the park include polar bear, <b>Svalbard</b> reindeer and Arctic fox.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also saw}} {{the rise of a}} number of {{scientific}} establishments. The Agricultural University of Norway had established a primitive seed bank in 1984. The University Centre in <b>Svalbard</b> opened on 6 September 1993 and had 30 students in its inaugural semester. Telenor Mobil established GSM coverage in 1995, and in 2004 the <b>Svalbard</b> Undersea Cable System opened, providing fiber optic cable connection to the mainland. The European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association (EISCAT) opened a radar in 1996, followed by <b>Svalbard</b> Satellite Station in 1999 and the <b>Svalbard</b> Global Seed Vault in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Norway was {{prior to}} 1920 {{extremely}} active in gaining {{international support for}} Norwegian sovereignty, but following the treaty, Norwegian interest in the archipelago dwindled. From {{the start of the}} Cold War, Norwegian politicians wanted to avoid bringing the islands into superpower politics. This resulted in a policy of avoiding agitating the Soviet Union, which again resulted in the Norwegian authorities actively working against both Norwegian and foreign activities on <b>Svalbard</b> which could raise tensions. Compared to mainland relations, which were dominated by deterring through NATO membership, the Norwegian policy on <b>Svalbard</b> was related to calming the Soviet Union. Similarly, while a foreign presence was encouraged on the mainland, it was strongly discouraged on <b>Svalbard.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{both sides}} of Wijdefjorden there is High Arctic steppe vegetation, {{dominated}} by grasses and extremely dry, basic earth. There are some areas dominated by exposure of mineral earth. The area around the fjord has a vegetation which is unique and not preserved {{in other areas of}} <b>Svalbard.</b> Along with vegetation found on nesting cliffs, it is the most exclusive flora in <b>Svalbard.</b> There are several exclusive species in the national park, including , Puccinellia svalbardensis, Gentianella tenella and Kobresia simpliciuscula. Of the larger fjords on <b>Svalbard,</b> Wijdefjorden is the least affected by humans, although a trapping station has been built at Austfjordnes.|$|E
5|$|Research on <b>Svalbard</b> {{centers on}} Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund, the most {{accessible}} {{areas in the}} high Arctic. The treaty grants permission for any nation to conduct research on <b>Svalbard,</b> resulting in the Polish Polar Station and the Chinese Arctic Yellow River Station, plus Russian facilities in Barentsburg. The University Centre in <b>Svalbard</b> in Longyearbyen offers undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate courses to 350 students in various arctic sciences, particularly biology, geology and geophysics. Courses are provided to supplement studies at the mainland universities; there are no tuition fees and courses are held in English, with Norwegian and international students equally represented.|$|E
5|$|<b>Svalbard</b> makes a {{prominent}} appearance in Northern Lights by Philip Pullman {{and the corresponding}} film. In the novel it {{is used as a}} prison for important and powerful people. It is inhabited by Panserbjørne, polar bears that wear armour forged from Sky-Iron. One of the primary characters, Lord Asriel, was imprisoned and manages to flee from <b>Svalbard</b> during the novel.|$|E
5|$|The Commissioner of Mining for <b>Svalbard</b> {{is part of}} the Norwegian Directorate of Mining, but {{retains its}} own offices in Longyearbyen. The {{commissioner}} is responsible for administrating mineral rights, both for mining and petroleum. Other public agencies which have supervisory roles, but are not stationed on <b>Svalbard,</b> are the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the Norwegian Directorate for Fire and Explosion Prevention and the Norwegian Directorate for Product and Electrical Safety.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Svalbard</b> Treaty of 1920 defines <b>Svalbard</b> as all islands, islets and skerries from 74° to 81° north latitude, {{and from}} 10° to 35° east longitude. The land area is , and {{dominated}} by the island of Spitsbergen, which constitutes {{more than half the}} archipelago, followed by Nordaustlandet and Edgeøya. All settlements are located on Spitsbergen, except the meteorological outposts on Bjørnøya and Hopen. The Norwegian state took possession of all unclaimed land, or 95.2% of the archipelago, at the time the <b>Svalbard</b> Treaty entered into force; Store Norske owns 4%, Arktikugol owns 0.4%, while other private owners hold 0.4%.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the national park and the protection {{is based on the}} <b>Svalbard</b> Environmental Protection Act, which takes its mandate from the requirements in the <b>Svalbard</b> Treaty to protect the environment of the archipelago. The overall responsibility for protection lies with the Norwegian Ministry of the Environment, which has delegated management to the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management and the Governor of <b>Svalbard.</b> The latter performs all day-to-day practical management, including registration and inspection. In aspects related to cultural heritage, the Governor reports to the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage, and in issues relating to pollution, to the Norwegian Pollution Control Authority. While it has no authority, the Norwegian Polar Institute performs monitoring, mapping and research.|$|E
5|$|The first {{proposal}} for an airport serving Ny-Ålesund was {{launched by the}} brothers Einar Sverre Pedersen and Gunnar Sverre Pedersen. Einar worked as chief navigator in the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and was instrumental in developing the airline routes over the North Pole. He envisioned that the airport in <b>Svalbard</b> could serve as an emergency landing aerodrome for intercontinental flights, and proposed that the Norwegian trunk airline service be extended to <b>Svalbard.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{hierarchical}} administrative subdivision {{codes for}} <b>Svalbard</b> is SJ.SV and for Jan Mayen is SJ.JM.|$|E
5|$|The {{responsibility}} of the recovery {{was transferred to the}} Governor of <b>Svalbard</b> on 30 August, since there were no survivors. In addition, police personnel from the mainland were transferred to <b>Svalbard</b> to work with the investigation and recovery. The work was supplemented by local volunteers. Because of the bad weather, which included fog and snow, it was often impossible to transport workers to the plateau, and work therefore started in the valley.|$|E
5|$|The supreme {{responsibility}} for conservation {{lies with the}} Norwegian Ministry of the Environment, which has delegated the management to the Governor of <b>Svalbard</b> and the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management. The foundation for conservation {{was established in the}} <b>Svalbard</b> Treaty of 1920, and has been further specified in the <b>Svalbard</b> Environmental Act of 2001. The first round of protection took force on 1 July 1973, when most of the current protected areas came into effect. This included the two large nature reserves and three of the national parks. Moffen Nature Reserve was established in 1983, followed by four national parks, three nature reserves and one geotope protection area between 2002 and 2005.|$|E
5|$|The treaty only allows {{taxation}} to {{the extent}} that it covers the cost of administrating the archipelago and covering the services provided to the residents. The tax rate is therefore significantly lower than in Metropolitan Norway, including the absence of value added tax. The government summarizes its expenses on <b>Svalbard</b> in the <b>Svalbard</b> Budget. The taxation rules made <b>Svalbard</b> a tax paradise, and in 2009 the oil rig operator Seadrill established a subsidiary in Longyearbyen to exploit the lower taxes. In 2011, the tax rate for profits exceeding NOK10 million were raised from 16 to 28 percent—the same as on the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{the mining}} {{industry}} in <b>Svalbard</b> {{has had more}} rights to operations within protected areas than in mainland Norway, where all such activities would be completely banned. Indre Wijdefjorden has the most strict regulations, with a total ban on construction of buildings and facilities, laying of cables and roads, earthwork, drainage, drilling, blasting, and excavation of petroleum, gas and minerals. It is the authorities' goal that <b>Svalbard</b> is {{to be one of}} the best-managed wilderness areas in the world. <b>Svalbard,</b> and thus the national park, is on Norway's tentative list for nomination as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|A {{mountain}} in <b>Svalbard</b> is also named Ben Nevis, after the Scottish peak. It is 922 metres high, and located {{south of the}} head of Raudfjorden, Albert I Land, in the northwestern part of the island of Spitsbergen.|$|E
5|$|Association {{football}} {{is the most popular}} sport in <b>Svalbard.</b> There are three football pitches, but no stadiums because of the low population.|$|E
5|$|Customers {{with their}} own {{installations}} include the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The station also reads and distributes data from the Japanese Hinode solar research satellite. The facility has seen a large increase in smaller customers after 2004, when the <b>Svalbard</b> Undersea Cable System started providing a fiber Internet connection. Concessions for downloading are only issued to civilian satellites, yet some data has been indirectly used by armed forces. There is a disagreement as to whether this constitutes a breach of the <b>Svalbard</b> Treaty.|$|E
5|$|During the {{considerations}} {{prior to}} the establishment of the national park, there was a conflict with the mining industry. <b>Svalbard</b> Minerals had found baryte within the national park borders, and Arktikugol holds two mining claim areas just south of the national park. The national park was established on 9 September 2005. It completed a several-year-long plan {{to increase the amount of}} protected areas of <b>Svalbard</b> from 55% to 65%, which had two years earlier resulted in Nordenskiöld Land National Park, Sassen – Bünsow Land National Park and Nordre Isfjorden National Park.|$|E
5|$|Each police {{district}} {{is led by}} a chief of police and is subdivided into several police stations in towns and cities, and sheriffs' offices for rural areas. The Governor of <b>Svalbard</b> acts as chief of police for <b>Svalbard.</b> Norwegian police officers do not carry firearms, but keep their Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine guns and Heckler & Koch P30 pistols locked down in the patrol cars. The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority is partially integrated with the police.|$|E
5|$|Flight 2801 was a {{chartered}} flight {{flown by}} Vnukovo Airlines {{on behalf of}} Arktikugol, which operated mines at the two company towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden in <b>Svalbard.</b> The aircraft was a Tupolev Tu-154M, with registration RA-85621, serial number 86A 742 and date of manufacture 14 January 1987. The flight consisted of a crew of eleven, including a cockpit crew of four (two aircraft pilots, one engineer and one navigator), a cabin crew of five and two technicians. The pilot in command (PiC) had previously landed at <b>Svalbard</b> Airport; the first officer had not and was the piloting pilot.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, YouTuber Tom Scott {{visited the}} island {{as part of}} his Amazing Places video series, {{producing}} videos on subjects such as the island's gun regulations, the <b>Svalbard</b> Global Seed Vault, and the Longyearbyen Sundial.|$|E
5|$|On 10 October 1986, a Cessna 185 from Antarctax crashed {{immediately}} after leaving <b>Svalbard</b> Airport {{en route to}} Ny-Ålesund, killing all six on board.|$|E
5|$|Polar {{bears are}} the iconic symbol of <b>Svalbard,</b> {{and one of}} the main tourist attractions. The animals are {{protected}} and people moving outside the settlements are required to have appropriate scare devices to ward off attacks. They are also advised to also carry a firearm for use as a last resort. A British schoolboy was killed by a polar bear in 2011. <b>Svalbard</b> and Franz Joseph Land share a common population of 3,000 polar bears, with Kong Karls Land being the most important breeding ground.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{work in the}} {{planning}} of ESRO operations concluded that the ESTRACK network would initially consist of four radio tracking and telemetry stations and three optical tracking stations. In addition to <b>Svalbard,</b> tracking and telemetry stations were built on the Falkland Islands, in Fairbanks, Alaska and in Redu, Belgium. France actively opposed the <b>Svalbard</b> location, as Norway was {{not a member of}} ESRO. The ESRO secretariat wanted to quicken the location decision, as it was necessary to have all four in operation before the launch of the ESRO-1 and ESRO-2 satellites.|$|E
5|$|Public {{administration}} of the archipelago {{is the responsibility of}} the Governor of <b>Svalbard,</b> who acts as county governor and chief of police. The institution was established by and is regulated by the <b>Svalbard</b> Act, which also limits which Norwegian laws apply to the islands. Longyearbyen Community Council is the only elected local government and is organized similar to a mainland municipality. Other Norwegian government agencies with a presence are the Directorate of Mining and the Tax Administration. The only diplomatic mission is the Consulate of Russia in Barentsburg.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the items}} from the expedition, {{including}} the balloon-silk boat and the tent, are {{on display at the}} Andréeexpeditionen Polar Centre at Grenna Museum, Sweden. The expedition is also featured in the Spitsbergen Airship Museum in Longyearbyen, <b>Svalbard.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Svalbard</b> Airport, Longyear, {{opened in}} 1975, {{allowing}} better facilities and connection with scheduled flights to the mainland. At the same time, Lufttransport established itself at <b>Svalbard</b> Airport. During {{the summer of}} 1975, the Norwegian Polar Institute stationed two helicopters at Ny-Ålesund Airport to support their expeditions. During the late 1970s there was little winter activity in Ny-Ålesund, but the air strip was kept operational for the few groups of researchers who did visit. A radio line repeater was installed at Kongsvegpasset in 1980, resulting in Ny-Ålesund receiving a telephone connection. A radio beacon was subsequently installed at the airport.|$|E
5|$|<b>Svalbard</b> is {{not part}} of the regular police districts—instead it law {{enforcement}} it handled by the Governor of <b>Svalbard.</b> He holds the responsibility as both county governor and chief of police, as well as holding other authority granted from the executive branch. Duties include environmental policy, family law, law enforcement, search and rescue, tourism management, information services, contact with foreign settlements, and abjudication in some areas of maritime inquiries and judicial examinations—albeit never in the same cases as acting as police. Jan Mayen is subordinate to Salten Police District.|$|E
