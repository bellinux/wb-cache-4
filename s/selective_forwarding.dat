In this paper, a well-known attack <b>selective</b> <b>forwarding</b> attack will be studied in network coding systems.

With such an attack, a misbehaving mesh router just forwards {{a subset of the}} packets it receives but drops the others. While most of the existing studies on <b>selective</b> <b>forwarding</b> attacks focus on attack detection under the assumption of an error-free wireless channel, {{we consider}} a more practical and challenging scenario that packet dropping may be due to an attack, or normal loss events such as medium access collision or bad channel quality. Specifically, we develop a channel aware detection (CAD) algorithm that can effectively identify the <b>selective</b> <b>forwarding</b> misbehavior from the normal channel losses. The CAD algorithm is based on two strategies, channel estimation and traffic monitoring. If the monitored loss rate at certain hops exceeds the estimated normal loss rate, those nodes involved will be identified as attackers. Moreover, we carry out analytical studies to determine the optimal detection thresholds that minimize the summation of false alarm and missed detection probabilities. We also compare our CAD approach with some existing solutions, through extensive computer simulations, to demonstrate the efficiency of discriminating <b>selective</b> <b>forwarding</b> attacks from normal channel losses.

Through forward body bias (FBB), the threshold voltage of the CMOS devices can be reduced after fabrication to bring the slow dies back to within the range of acceptable specs.

30|$|The {{impact of}} {{different}} PGS on PDR {{is depicted in}} Figure  11. Since both our proposed CAIR and CAR make connectivity the first consideration, their PDR are satisfying overall. In addition, due {{to the introduction of}} delay estimation to the routing selection in CAIR, the probability of disconnections between platoons even with traffic lights enabled is reduced. Therefore, our CAIR shows a bit improvement over CAR. STAR in this case shows a preferable PDR attributed to its intersection-based store-carry-forward mechanism at a price of transmission delay extension as shown in Figure  9. Actually, under this map configuration, STAR performs even better than CAR because CAR has no consideration of building blocking on wireless signal thus leading some sent packets dropped. Although JBR implemented recovery mechanism through <b>selective</b> greedy <b>forwarding</b> by coordinators, its PDR is unsatisfied in this case. In fact, when there are not any qualified neighbors to be selected as the next hop, the packet using JBR will be directly dropped without store or carry for future relay. In addition, the influence of traffic light on the path connectivity makes the <b>selective</b> greedy <b>forwarding</b> skill fail and degrade to the general greedy algorithm. The PDR of GPSR in this scenario is very poor and not over 0.05 with PGS changing. This result demonstrates that a vehicle density of 66.7 vehicles/km 2 is not sufficient for GPSR to work well without frequent occurrence of local optimums. Besides, the introduction of buildings based on real map data brings too many obstacles to make GPSR forward successful.|$|R

In sensitive environments, it is vital to maintain the operability of the network in an effort to support the decision-making process that depends on the sensors’ observations. The network’s operability can be maintained if observations can reach the specified destination and also if the sensors have adequate energy resources. The operability is negatively affected by security attacks, such as the <b>selective</b> <b>forward</b> and the denial of service (DoS), that can be executed against the WSN. The attacks’ impact greatly depends on the attackers’ capabilities such as their knowledge and the number of malicious nodes they hold. Currently, the research community focuses on addressing casual attackers that don’t persist with their attack strategy. However, the proposed solutions cannot address persistent attackers that continue with their attack execution after the network has applied appropriate recovery countermeasures. Designing an adaptive recovery strategy is challenging as a number of issues need to be taken into consideration such as the network’s density, the number of malicious nodes and the persistent attack strategy. This research work formulates a persistent attack strategy and investigates the integration of different recovery countermeasures in WSNs.
