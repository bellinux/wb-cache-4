5|$|Macdonald wrote Nova Scotia's {{submission}} {{and presented}} it himself when the Commission held hearings in Halifax in February 1938. He {{called on the}} federal government to take full responsibility for social programs such as unemployment insurance, old-age pensions and mothers' allowances. Macdonald recommended that the federal government be given exclusive jurisdiction over income taxes and succession duties to pay for these programs. He argued however, that to maintain their independence, the provinces needed to collect indirect sources of revenue such as <b>sales</b> <b>taxes.</b> He also called for exclusive provincial control over such minor tax fields as gasoline and electricity taxes.|$|E
5|$|The {{increase}} {{in the rate of}} the state sales tax from 6% to 7% took effect on July 15, 2006, and also increased the sales tax rate in the state's Urban Enterprise Zones (UEZs) from 3% to 3.5%. A significant change was made in the payment of <b>sales</b> <b>taxes</b> by businesses operating in the UEZs in that they would be required to pay the entire amount of the full tax rate to the state on all appropriate purchases, and wait for the state to rebate them the difference.|$|E
5|$|Community Transit (CT) is {{the public}} transit {{authority}} of Snohomish County, Washington, United States, excluding the city of Everett, in the Seattle metropolitan area. It operates local bus, paratransit and vanpool service within Snohomish County, as well as commuter buses to Downtown Seattle and the University of Washington campus. CT is publicly funded, financed through <b>sales</b> <b>taxes,</b> farebox revenue and subsidies, with an operating budget of $133.2 million. The entire agency carried more than 10 million passengers in 2015, placing it fourth among transit agencies in the Puget Sound region. The city of Everett, which serves as the county seat, is served by Everett Transit, a municipal transit system.|$|E
5000|$|Examples {{where the}} {{reduction}} or repeal {{of a local}} <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> may be appropriate include {{where there has been}} significant waste or mismanagement of <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> proceeds by a local government, when there has been controversial or questionable spending of <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> proceeds by a local government (particularly where <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> proceeds are used to pay for excessive public employee salaries and/or benefits such as pensions), when the quality of the programs and services being financed from <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> proceeds is not at a high level expected by voters, when the local <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> rate is excessive or unreasonably high (particularly in situations where a significant local <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> increase was narrowly approved by the voters), or when promises previously made by local politicians about the spending of local <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> proceeds are broken after voter approval of the <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> (particularly in situations where local politicians made legally nonbinding promises concerning the spending of general <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> proceeds that are not legally restricted for specific purposes).|$|R
2500|$|The state <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> {{is set at}} 6.25 percent. Cities {{are allowed}} to impose an {{additional}} 1% tax, and additional taxes not to exceed 1% may be approved by voters for any combination of county <b>sales</b> <b>tax,</b> transportation districts, economic development, and/or crime prevention. [...] The average <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> in Texas amounts to 8.25 percent. The state determines the items subject to <b>sales</b> <b>tax,</b> which all other entities must follow. [...] Motor vehicle sales are subject only to the 6.25% state <b>sales</b> <b>tax.</b> [...] Food, except for prepared food, and non-prescription medicines are among the major items exempt from <b>sales</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|R
25|$|Washington's state base <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> is 6.5 percent {{which is}} {{combined}} with a local <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> which varies by locality.

The cities of Lynwood and Mill Creek have the highest <b>sale</b> <b>tax</b> rate in the state at 10.4 percent. These taxes apply to services as well as products. Most foods are exempt from sales tax; however, prepared foods, dietary supplements and soft drinks remain taxable. The combined state and local retail <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> rates increase the taxes paid by consumers, depending on the variable local <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> rates, generally between 8 and 9 percent.|$|R
5|$|Community Transit began {{restoring}} cut {{service in}} September 2014, adding 13 {{percent of its}} former bus hours primarily to improve midday service. In June 2015, CT restored its Sunday and holiday service {{as part of a}} 27,000-hour expansion, representing 20 percent of the 2010 reduction, funded by recovering sales tax revenue and a 25-cent increase in fares the following month. The agency was given approval from the state legislature in July 2015 to increase <b>sales</b> <b>taxes</b> by an additional 0.3%, dependent on voter approval via a ballot measure during the November 2015 election that was eventually won, to fund a new Swift line as well as local service expansion.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, the Indian National Congress {{was elected}} to power in the Presidency of Madras for the first time. Chakravarti Rajagopalachari was the first Chief Minister of the Presidency {{to come from the}} Congress party. He {{successfully}} enacted the Temple Entry Authorization and Indemnity Act and introduced both prohibition and <b>sales</b> <b>taxes</b> in the Madras Presidency. His rule is largely remembered for the use of Hindi being made compulsory in educational institutions, a measure which made him highly unpopular as a politician and sparked widespread Anti-Hindi agitations, which led to violence in some places. Over 1,200 men, women, and children were jailed for their participation in such Anti-Hindi agitations while Thalamuthu and Natarasan died during the protests. In 1940, Congressional ministers resigned in protest over the Government of India's declaration of war on Germany without their consent. The Governor of Madras, Sir Arthur Hope, took over the administration and the unpopular law was eventually repealed by him on 21 February 1940.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota has a {{progressive}} income tax structure; the four brackets of {{state income tax}} rates are 5.35, 7.05, 7.85 and 9.85 percent. As of 2008, Minnesota was ranked 12th {{in the nation in}} per capita total state and local taxes. In 2008, Minnesotans paid 10.2 percent of their income in state and local taxes; the U.S. average was 9.7 percent. The state sales tax in Minnesota is 6.875 percent, but there is no sales tax on clothing, prescription drug medications, some services, or food items for home consumption. The state legislature may allow municipalities to institute local <b>sales</b> <b>taxes</b> and special local taxes, such as the 0.5 percent supplemental sales tax in Minneapolis. Excise taxes are levied on alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel. The state imposes a use tax on items purchased elsewhere but used within Minnesota. Owners of real property in Minnesota pay property tax to their county, municipality, school district, and special taxing districts.|$|E

5|$|The mall {{also added}} new burdens to city services, with {{building}} inspectors {{having to work}} overtime to inspect each store area as it was completed. While mall security was issued citation books so they could issue parking tickets directly, the city police still had to work double shifts to cover the traffic during the mall's opening weekend. Overall, the mall increased traffic on the Earl Rudder Freeway, and city traffic engineers noted it would cause more traffic backup. Traffic signals {{were added to the}} mall's main entrance, while long-term plans were made to both expand the freeway and add additional interchanges along Harvey. Traffic studies were implemented to study the traffic after the mall's opening to developed additional plans to mitigate issues. There were concerns that the mall would be the final blow to the downtown area of neighboring city Bryan, Texas, which was already suffering reduced business after the opening of smaller Manor East Mall and the Townshire shopping center, both within Bryan. Bryan city officials noted an immediate decrease in revenue due to Sears moving from Bryan to College Station, taking $50â100,000 of <b>sales</b> <b>taxes</b> with it. However, as a whole the city was hopeful that the mall would have benefits to the city in the form of increased city growth as a whole. The city planners felt it would only be a passing fad for local rural and lower-income families, who would still return to downtown Bryan due to its proximity.|$|E
