40|$|This {{research}} examines <b>self-provisioning</b> {{activities in}} rural Canada and describes their prevalence {{both in terms}} of participation {{and the degree to which}} they make material contributions to households. <b>Self-provisioning</b> is correlated with a number of household characteristics, such as employment, income, and length of residency. Results show that <b>self-provisioning</b> activities are still common in rural Canada, particularly those requiring low capital investments such as gardening and wildcrafting. However the analysis reveals weak associations between socio-economic variables and <b>self-provisioning,</b> providing further evidence that, in aggregate, rural households have complex motivations for participating in <b>self-provisioning</b> activities and that economic need is not always the main driver. The data demonstrate a low level of participation amongst the very poorest households, implying structural barriers to participation for some of these activities...|$|R
40|$|Recently, it {{has become}} {{increasingly}} recognized that the reach of the market economy is shallower than previously assumed and that other livelihood practices persist, such as <b>self-provisioning.</b> However, neither the prevalence of nor the rationales underpinning engagement in these non-market work practices have been widely evaluated. To start to bridge this gap, this article evaluates the extent of <b>self-provisioning</b> in post-Soviet Ukraine and the reasons for engaging in such subsistence production. Until now, participants in <b>self-provisioning</b> have been portrayed either as rational economic actors, dupes, seekers of self-identity, or simply doing so out of necessity or choice. Analyzing face-to-face interviews with 600 households in Ukraine, this article not only reveals the extensive use of <b>self-provisioning</b> in Ukraine but also develops a theoretically-integrative typology to explain the diverse reasons for engaging in such activity which differentiates between "willing" (rational economic actors, choice, identity seeking) and "reluctant" (economic and market necessity, dupes) participants in <b>self-provisioning.</b> The outcome is a call to evaluate further the ongoing importance of the subsistence economy in Central and Eastern Europe and to re-theorize its persistence in a more theoretically integrative manner than has so far been the case. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

First using cross-sectional household data, I investigate the importance of consumption from home produce (<b>self-provisioning)</b> and conclude that studying food consumption decisions in isolation from production is not warranted for Turkey. I develop a testing procedure incorporated into linear approximation of the almost ideal demand system (LA/AIDS) model to formally test the relevance of food <b>self-provisioning.</b> Studying consumption in isolation from production leads significant overestimation of rural households 2 ̆ 7 responsiveness to price and income signals especially for the dairy and egg products. Second I investigate the contribution of consumption from home produce to alleviate vulnerability to undernutrition in rural areas. I find that the level, depth and severity of food poverty to be least among rural households who engage in food <b>self-provisioning</b> and food <b>self-provisioning</b> reduce vulnerability to undernutrition. Moreover, food <b>self-provisioning</b> is concentrated in expensive calories from vegetables and dairy so <b>self-provisioning</b> rural households also have a more balanced diet. Finally I investigate whether milk processing firms abuse their oligopsony power to excessively profit themselves to the expense of milk farmers and final consumers. I look for evidence whether the speed of adjustment of processed milk price is same when farm-gate milk prices increase and decrease. I find no evidence that will point out any price gauging {{on the part of}} milk processors to benefit themselves. Actually I detect a long-term downward trend in processed milk prices coinciding with new major entries to milk processing industry...|$|R

40|$|Food {{systems are}} of {{increasing}} interest in both {{research and policy}} communities. Surveys of post-socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) show high rates of food <b>self-provisioning.</b> These practices have been {{explained in terms of}} being ‘coping strategies of the poor’. Alber and Kohler’s ‘Informal Food Production in the Enlarged European Union’ (2008) offers a prominent account of this argument, supported by quantitative data. However, evidence from our case study of food <b>self-provisioning</b> in one CEE state - Czechia - contradicts their findings. Newly commissioned survey data, as well as a fresh look at the data they were working from, demonstrate that rather than being motivated by poverty, these widespread practices serve as a hobby and as a way of accessing ‘healthy food’. With food <b>self-provisioning</b> becoming an increasingly prominent subject in advanced industrial countries, in terms of both health and environmental policy, we propose that much greater care is taken in researching and interpreting the reasons for differences in food systems. Our findings are that environmentally sustainable and healthy <b>self-provisioning</b> in Czechia is motivated by a range of reasons, and practised by a significant proportion of the population across all social groups. This conclusion questions linear narratives of progress that figure ‘western’ practices as advanced or complete or automatically desirable, and contributes in a modest way to a decentring of narratives of progress...|$|R

50|$|During Communism, most socialist {{countries}} in the Eastern Bloc were characterized by under-urbanization, which meant that industrial growth occurred {{well in advance of}} urban growth and was sustained by rural-urban commuting. City growth, residential mobility, land and housing development were under tight political control. Consequently, sub-urbanization in post-communist Europe is not only a recent but also a particular phenomenon. The creation of housing and land markets and state withdrawal from housing provision have {{led to the development of}} privatized modes of housing production and consumption, with an increasing role for private actors and, particularly, for households. Yet, the regulatory and institutional frameworks indispensable to a market-driven housing system - including housing finance - have remained underdeveloped, particularly in south-eastern Europe. This environment has undoubtedly stimulated housing <b>self-provision.</b> Clearly, different forces have shaped different outcomes. Long-suppressed urbanization and a dramatic housing backlog resulted in extensive peri-urban growth in Tirana (Albania), which during the 1990s doubled the size of the city whereas war refugees put pressure on cities of former Yugoslavia. Elsewhere processes of suburbanization seemed dominant, but their pace differed according to housing shortages, available finance, preferences and the degree of ‘permitted’ informality. The process was slow in Prague during the 1990s and more apparent after 2000, when housing affordability improved. Conversely, Slovenian and Romanian suburban developments visibly surrounded cities/towns during the 1990s. Nonetheless, socialist legacies of underdeveloped infrastructure and the affordability crisis of transition differentiate post-socialist suburbs from their Western counterparts.|$|E

40|$|Food web {{knowledge}} {{is a prerequisite}} for adequate resource management in the Antarctic ecosystem. Accurate dietary specifications for the major consumers within the Antarctic ecosystem are needed. Procellariid species are the most numerous avian species in Antarctica and account for 20 % to 40 % of the overall consumption by seabirds in the area. Diet composition of two important procellariids, Cape and Snow Petrels, was studied at Signy Island during the breeding season 2005 – 2006. Food samples were obtained by stomach flushing of both chick-feeding birds and <b>self-provisioning</b> birds. Original prey mass was reconstructed from identifiable remains in the stomach samples. Significantly different diet compositions were found between chick-feeding and <b>self-provisioning</b> Cape Petrels based on reconstructed weight (chick-feeders 39 : 61 : 0 : 0, fish:crustacean:squid:other; <b>self-provisioning</b> birds 28 : 65 : 7 : 1, F:C:S:O). By contrast, {{no significant differences were found}} between chick-feeding Snow Petrels (66 : 34 : 0 : 0, F:C:S:O) and <b>self-provisioning</b> birds (68 : 32 : 0 : 0, F:C:S:O). Dominant prey items were Antarctic Krill Euphausia superba and the myctophid fish Electrona antarctica. Compared with findings undertaken at other locations, Cape Petrels at Signy Island had higher dietary fractions of crustaceans. Similarly, this study shows higher fractions of krill and lower fractions of fish in Snow Petrels at Signy Island than at other locations. A reasonable explanation for the high crustacean fraction in both seabird species might be the local high abundance of Antarctic Krill. This emphasises that local differences in diets need to be taken into account in modelling studies. Also, fish is an abundant prey item in both species, showing that, even in a strongly krill-dominated region, fish may remain an important part of the diet of Antarctic petrel species. The differences in diet between chick-feeding and <b>self-provisioning</b> Cape Petrels also show the importance of studying both groups in overall dietary research...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{questions}} {{assumptions about}} the relationship between class formation, sustainability and patterns of consumption. The empirical elements of the research are based upon qualitative and quantitative time-series research into food <b>self-provisioning</b> and 'quiet sustainability' in post socialist Central and Eastern Europe (Poland and the Czech Republic). It considers sustainable practices that are often considered to be taking place 'in the wrong place and the wrong time', i. e. they appear anomalous in terms of western expectations of patterns of development. We offer evidence of comparatively very high levels of food <b>self-provisioning</b> and sharing of the resulting produce amongst middle class Poles and Czechs. This evidence questions widely held assumptions about class, development and consumption. This evidence may be of significance for consideration of a much wider set of household practices/behaviours that are associated with the middle classes. Our explorations of the reasons for food <b>self-provisioning</b> throw new light on discussions of ethical consumption: ethics is lightly worn, even unacknowledged, amongst practitioners, but the commitments are widespread and robust. Our empirical findings, and the theoretical arguments we seek to test on the basis of them, are of particular significance in the context of rapid processes of rural and urban change in emerging economies...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Self-provided {{housing is}} a major form of housing supply in nearly all the {{developed}} countries of W. Europe, N. America and Australasia. In many, like France or Germany, it accounted for the major part of housing output during the 1980 s. Contrary to many opinions <b>self-provision</b> is not associated with backwardness, peripherality, or lack of market development Rather, self-provided housing is often a major element in the expansion of European metropoles and sometimes reaches the heights of 'post-fordist ' Industrial organisation and product develop-ment. <b>Self-provision</b> lowers the money cost of housing and usually ensures higher quality, {{and in this way}} enlarges the housing choices of middle-income nuclear families. Materials and land costs remain substantial barriers to <b>self-provision,</b> and the more disadvantaged groups are usually unable to participate. However, the presence of a large self-provided sector can indirectly improve their housing position. Housing cycles will be calmed, spatial polarisation will be less severe, and there will be less competition from the more advantaged in rental markets. A significant selfprovision sector can also have important effects on the housebuilding industry, both through direct competition and by presenting a different market environment. The net result {{is likely to be a}} decline in speculative behaviour and a concentration on longer-term efficiency. Finally, there are various `models ' for a successful self-provided housing sector, where the necessary social support is organised in different ways by different agencies. These will affect the level and distribution of <b>self-provision.</b> Given the importance of self-provided housing in all these ways, it merits considerably further research than has been the case so far...|$|E

Combined with demographic pressure and competition for land, rural households face considerable pressure to reduce their livelihood dependence on agriculture.

40|$|This paper brings {{together}} consideration of food {{policies and practices}} and of post-socialist transition to raise neglected questions about means of nurturing more sustainable food systems in the developed world. The last three decades have been marked by the growing salience of food as a political and scholarly concern. While market-based alternative food systems have been heralded for their potential to promote environmental sustainability, the benefits of non-market practices such as household food <b>self-provisioning</b> and barter have been assumed rather than being the focus of research. In the western context, both types of food consumption have positive connotations. Although food <b>self-provisioning</b> in European post-socialist societies is a more wide-spread practice than in western societies, it {{has been on the}} periphery of research. The existing literature has conceptualised them as ‘coping strategies’ or as a legacy of irregular supply of goods in the state socialist era. Drawing on empirical research in the Czech Republic, we are proposing a novel approach to the phenomenon of household food production in post-socialist societies as a practice compliant with principles of sustainability. First, we highlight the large extent and social inclusivity of food <b>self-provisioning</b> in Czech society to demonstrate how post-socialist societies are a repository of a rich set of sustainability-promoting consumption practices in relation to food systems. Second, we show that international and domestic policy actors in these societies have ignored these alternative, socially inclusive and environmentally effective practices in favour of far less effective market-based sustainability oriented food policy initiatives. The paper promotes a more integrated view of non-market and market approaches in the pursuit of more sustainable food systems...|$|R
