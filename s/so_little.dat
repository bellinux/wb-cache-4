5|$|Labour {{comprised}} skilled volunteers, engineers, {{designers and}} supervisors, who were paid and treated well, second came volunteer workers, often skilled technicians, such as carpenters, plumbers, electricians and metal workers, again these workers were paid, took holidays and were well treated. Next came unskilled forced labour, paid very little and treated quite harshly, lastly came effective slave labour, paid <b>so</b> <b>little,</b> badly fed and treated very harshly. The OT ran training courses to improve labour skills.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about Sappho's life for certain – <b>so</b> <b>little</b> that Monique Wittig and Sande Zeig's Lesbian Peoples: Material for a Dictionary {{contains}} an entire page for the entry on Sappho, which is deliberately left blank. There are three major sources of information about Sappho's life: her own poetry, other ancient sources, and deductions from knowledge of the historical context in which Sappho worked.|$|E

5|$|The Javan {{rhinoceros}} never {{fared well}} in captivity. The oldest {{lived to be}} 20, about half the age that the rhinos can reach in the wild. No records are known of a captive rhino giving birth.

5|$|In {{the early}} years in western Virginia, pioneer {{settlers}} were primarily concerned with providing defense from Native American attacks, <b>so</b> <b>little</b> emphasis was placed upon education. Education {{was viewed as a}} religious duty, to be provided for at home, where its quality was dependent upon the spare time and level of education of parents. With the growth of settlement in Pearsall's Flats, and later Romney, the need for educational facilities became apparent and the community began plans for the establishment of schools and churches.|$|E
5|$|On graduation, Kilburn was {{recruited}} by C.P. Snow. He {{was given a}} quick course in electronics, and was posted to the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) in Malvern, where he worked on radar in Group 19 under Frederic Calland Williams. The group was responsible for designing and debugging electronic circuitry. Although Williams was initially disappointed at being given someone with <b>so</b> <b>little</b> practical experience, Kilburn became a valued member of the team. On 14 August 1943, he married Irene Marsden, a shop assistant. They went on to raise a son, John, and a daughter, Anne.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{independent}} {{release in}} June 1987, the JAMs were {{ordered by the}} Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society to destroy all unsold copies of the album, following a complaint from ABBA.

They also released {{a version of the}} album titled 1987 (The JAMs 45 Edits), stripped of all unauthorised samples to leave periods of protracted silence and <b>so</b> <b>little</b> audible content that it was formally classed as a 12-inch single.|$|E

5|$|Sodium atoms have 11 electrons, {{one more}} than the {{extremely}} stable configuration of the noble gas neon. Because of this and its low first ionization energy of 495.8 kJ/mol, the sodium atom {{is much more likely}} to lose the last electron and acquire a positive charge than to gain one and acquire a negative charge. This process requires <b>so</b> <b>little</b> energy that sodium is readily oxidized by giving up its 11th electron. In contrast, the second ionization energy is very high (4562 kJ/mol), because the 10th electron is closer to the nucleus than the 11th electron. As a result, sodium usually forms ionic compounds involving the Na+ cation.|$|E
5|$|The German-born British {{physicist}} Arthur Schuster expanded upon Crookes' experiments {{by placing}} metal plates {{parallel to the}} cathode rays and applying an electric potential between the plates. The field deflected the rays toward the positively charged plate, providing further evidence that the rays carried negative charge. By measuring the amount of deflection for a given level of current, in 1890 Schuster was able to estimate the charge-to-mass ratio of the ray components. However, this produced a value {{that was more than}} a thousand times greater than what was expected, <b>so</b> <b>little</b> credence was given to his calculations at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{first case}} against Acton, before Mr. Baron Carter, {{was for the}} murder in 1726 of Thomas Bliss, a {{carpenter}} and debtor. Unable to pay the prison fees, Bliss had been left with <b>so</b> <b>little</b> to eat that {{he had tried to}} escape by throwing a rope over the wall, but his pursuers severed it and he fell 20feet into the prison yard. Wanting to know who had supplied the rope, Acton beat him with a bull's pizzle, stamped on his stomach, placed him in the hole (a damp space under the stairs), then in the strong room.|$|E

5|$|The native Britons had {{converted}} to Christianity under Roman rule. The Anglo-Saxon invasions separated the British church from European Christianity for centuries, so {{the church in}} Rome had no presence or authority in Britain, and in fact, Rome knew <b>so</b> <b>little</b> about the British church that it was unaware of any schism in customs. However, Æthelberht would have known something about the Roman church from his Frankish wife, Bertha, who had brought a bishop, Liudhard, with her across the Channel, and for whom Æthelberht built a chapel, St Martin's.|$|E
5|$|The {{order and}} {{regularity}} that prevailed on board, {{from the moment}} the ship struck till she totally disappeared, far exceeded anything that I had thought could be effected by the best discipline; and it is the more to be wondered at seeing that most of the soldiers were but a short time in the service. Everyone did as he was directed and there was not a murmur or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – I never saw any embarkation conducted with <b>so</b> <b>little</b> noise or confusion.|$|E
5|$|Western {{attitudes towards}} killer whales have changed {{dramatically}} in recent decades. In the mid-1960s and early 1970s, killer whales came to much greater public and scientific awareness, {{starting with the}} first live-capture and display of a killer whale known as Moby Doll, a resident harpooned off Saturna Island in 1964. <b>So</b> <b>little</b> was known at the time, it was nearly {{two months before the}} whale's keepers discovered what food (fish) it was willing to eat. To the surprise of those who saw him, Moby Doll was a docile, nonaggressive whale that made no attempts to attack humans.|$|E

5|$|Although DuMont's {{programming}} pre-dated videotape, many DuMont offerings {{were recorded}} on kinescopes. These kinescopes {{were said to}} be stored in a warehouse until the 1970s. Actress Edie Adams, the wife of comedian Ernie Kovacs (both regular performers on early television) testified in 1996 before a panel of the Library of Congress on the preservation of television and video. Adams claimed that <b>so</b> <b>little</b> value was given to these films that the stored kinescopes were loaded into three trucks and dumped into Upper New York Bay. Nevertheless, a number of DuMont programs survive at The Paley Center for Media in New York City, the UCLA Film and Television Archive in Los Angeles, in the Peabody Awards Collection at the University of Georgia, and the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Although the Germans {{expected}} another Allied {{landing in}} the Mediterranean, the advancing Red Army and the Allied landings in Normandy placed great strains on German resources, <b>so</b> <b>little</b> was done to improve the condition of Army Group G, which was occupying Southern France. Given the advancing Allied forces in northern France, the Germans deemed a realistic defense in the south impossible. Johannes Blaskowitz's Army GroupG headquarters discussed a general withdrawal from southern France in July and August with the German High Command, but the 20 July plot led to an atmosphere in which any withdrawal {{was out of the}} question. Blaskowitz was quite aware that with his scattered forces, any serious Allied landing attempt would be impossible to ward off. He planned a withdrawal in secret, to include demolition of the ports and proceeding in an orderly manner, covered by the 11th Panzer Division. He intended to establish a new defense line centered on Dijon in central France. German intelligence was aware of the impending Allied landing, and on 13August Blaskowitz ordered the 11th Panzer Division to move east of the Rhône River, where the landing was expected.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of Sumatran rhino populations has identified three distinct genetic lineages. The channel between Sumatra and Malaysia {{was not as}} significant a barrier for the rhinos as the Barisan Mountains {{along the length of}} Sumatra, for rhinos in eastern Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia are more closely related than the rhinos {{on the other side of}} the mountains in western Sumatra. In fact, the eastern Sumatra and Malaysia rhinos show <b>so</b> <b>little</b> genetic variance, the populations were likely not separate during the Pleistocene, when sea levels were much lower and Sumatra formed part of the mainland. Both populations of Sumatra and Malaysia, however, are close enough genetically that interbreeding would not be problematic. The rhinos of Borneo are sufficiently distinct that conservation geneticists have advised against crossing their lineages with the other populations. Conservation geneticists have recently begun to study the diversity of the gene pool within these populations by identifying microsatellite loci. The results of initial testing found levels of variability within Sumatran rhino populations comparable to those in the population of the less endangered African rhinos, but the genetic diversity of Sumatran rhinos is an area of continuing study.|$|E
