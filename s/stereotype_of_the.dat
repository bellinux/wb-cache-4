5|$|The {{fact that}} the Polish Jewish {{community}} was decimated during World War II, coupled with well-known collaboration stories, has contributed to a <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish population having been passive in regard to, or even supportive of, Jewish suffering. Also, the postwar portrayals of Holocaust perpetrators based on court testimonies greatly contribute to this multifaceted distortion in perspective, because the German policemen remained silent till the end about Polish help to Jews and their own brutal punishment for such help.|$|E

Into her life enter two radically different men. One of them is her boss, Thyagu (Rajinikanth), who owns the advertising agency she works for. He is a <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> successful man: money-minded, opinionated, arrogant, and a male chauvinist. In sharp contrast is Arun (Kamal Haasan), who has come to Chennai from Coimbatore to make a documentary on women. Sensitive and sincere, he believes his job has a purpose and is both shocked and amused at the cynical attitudes of Manju and Thyagu.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{folk music}} in Northern England is a {{combination}} of styles of England and Scotland – what is now called the Anglo-Scottish border ballad was once prevalent as far south as Lancashire. In the Middle Ages, much of Northern folk was accompanied by bagpipes, with styles including the Lancashire bagpipe, Yorkshire bagpipe and Northumbrian smallpipes. These disappeared {{in the early nineteenth century}} from the industrialising south of the region, but remain in the music of Northumbria. The British brass band tradition began in Northern England at around the same time: the dismissal of the Cheshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire military bands after the Napoleonic Wars, combined with the desire of industrial communities to better themselves, led to the founding of civilian bands. These bands provided entertainment at community events and led protest marches during the era of radical agitation. Although the style has since spread across much of Great Britain, brass bands remain a <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North, and the Whit Friday brass band contests draw hundreds of bands from across the UK and further afield.|$|E

This paper aims to examine <b>the</b> presentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sexual <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> nurses by newspapers and the sex/pornography industry.

The media was found to emphasize {{both positive and negative}} nursing stereotypes and in comparison with other occupations and professions sexual stereotyping was prevalent. <b>The</b> utilization <b>of</b> nursing imagery is also significantly visible across a wide range of pornographic and sex industry material...|$|R

Other films which have followed in Curtis's footsteps include Sliding Doors (1998), Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and Laurence (1998), About a Boy (2002), Wimbledon, and the American film What a Girl Wants (2002).

25|$|Throughout {{the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries, the common belief among educated sectors of the European populace was that there had never been any genuine cult of witches and that all those persecuted and {{executed}} as such had been innocent of the crime. At this time, two figures independently raised the prospect that the witch trials had been influenced by stereotypes and folk customs that had pre-Christian origins. In his 1749 work Del Congresso Notturno delle Lamie (On the Nocturnal Meeting of Witches), the Italian cleric Girolamo Tartarotti claimed that the <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> witch in Early Modern Europe was influenced by pre-Christian folk beliefs. Similar ideas were echoed by the German folklorist Jacob Grimm in his Deutsche Mythologie (Teutonic Mythology), first published in 1835. Here, he claimed that the witch stereotype reflected an blending of pre-Christian folk traditions with the later Medieval views of heresy. Both Tartarotti and Grimm would subsequently be erroneously cited as claiming that the witches had been members of a surviving pre-Christian cult.|$|E

Several conversations between Jewish characters perpetuate the Nazi line that Jews are inherently hostile to non-Jews. According to David Welch, the Nazis issued a guide to the press explaining how to interpret the film. The guide emphasized that a key point of the film was that once Jews like Süß got into positions of responsibility and power, [...] "they exploited power, not {{for the good of the}} community, but for their own racial ends." ...|$|E

500|$|Tintin in America was {{the third}} story in the series. At the time, the Belgian far right was deeply {{critical}} of the United States, as it was of the Soviet Union. Wallez—and {{to a lesser degree}} Hergé—shared these opinions, viewing the country's capitalism, consumerism, and mechanisation as a threat to traditional Belgian society. Wallez wanted Hergé to use the story to denounce American capitalism and had little interest in depicting Native Americans, which was Hergé's primary desire. As a result, Tintin's encounter with the natives took up only a sixth of the narrative. Hergé sought to demystify the [...] "cruel savage" [...] <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Natives that had been widely perpetuated in western films. His depiction of the Natives was broadly sympathetic, yet he also depicted them as gullible and naïve, much as he had depicted the Congolese in the previous Adventure.|$|E

Therefore, [...] "he goal of the Satanism of the ONA is to create a new individual through direct experience, practice and self-development [...] the grades of the ONA system being highly individual, based on the initiates' own practical and real-life acts, instead of merely performing certain ceremonial rituals". Thus Satanism, the ONA assert, requires venturing into the realm of the forbidden and illegal in order to shake the practitioner loose of cultural and political conditioning. Intentionally transgressive, the Order has been characterised as providing [...] "an aggressive and elitist spirituality". Religious studies scholar Graham Harvey claimed that the ONA fit the <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Satanist [...] "better than other groups", something which he thought was deliberately achieved by embracing [...] "deeply shocking" [...] and illegal acts.|$|E

500|$|Among Waters' Victorian-set novels, {{depictions of}} sexual {{encounters}} are also, according to Palmer, {{the most vivid}} in Tipping the Velvet. A review in The Advocate calls the book [...] "riotously sexy", and The Seattle Times suggests the scene where Nan shows Kitty how to open and eat an oyster is evocative of Tom Jones. This follows a marked difference in recently written fiction by and for lesbians. Frank depictions of lesbian sexuality specifically penned by women have been quieted by censorship that equated lesbian sex with aberrant mental behaviour, or employed it as an erotic element controlled by, and for the benefit of, men. Lesbian literary scholar Bonnie Zimmerman writes, [...] "Lesbians have been reticent and uncomfortable about sexual writing in part because we wish to reject the patriarchal <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lesbian as a voracious sexual vampire who spends all her time in bed. It is safer to be a lesbian if sex is kept in the closet or under the covers. We don’t wish to give the world another stick with which to beat us." ...|$|E
