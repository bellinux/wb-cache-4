5000|$|<b>Spark-ignition</b> <b>engines</b> are {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "gasoline engines" [...] in North America, and [...] "petrol engines" [...] in Britain {{and the rest of the}} world. However, these terms are not preferred, since <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engines</b> can (and increasingly are) run on fuels other than petrol/gasoline, such as autogas (LPG), methanol, ethanol, bioethanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), hydrogen, and (in drag racing) nitromethane.|$|R

50|$|The Hesselman {{engine is}} a hybrid between a petrol engine and a Diesel engine {{introduced}} by Swedish engineer Jonas Hesselman in 1925. It represented the {{first use of}} direct gasoline injection on a <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engine</b> used to power a road going vehicle. The Hesselman engine saw use in heavy trucks and buses in models produced in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of twincharging is {{the complexity and}} expense of components. Usually, to provide acceptable response, smoothness of power delivery, and adequate power gain over a single-compressor system, expensive electronic and/or mechanical controls must be used. In a <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engine,</b> a low compression ratio must also be used if the supercharger produces high boost levels, negating some of the efficiency benefit of low displacement.|$|E
50|$|A {{four-stroke}} <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engine</b> is an Otto cycle engine. It {{consists of}} following four strokes: suction or intake stroke, compression stroke, expansion or power stroke, exhaust stroke. Each stroke consists of 180 degree rotation of crankshaft rotation and hence a four-stroke cycle is completed through 720 degree of crank rotation. Thus for one complete cycle {{there is only}} one power stroke while the crankshaft turns by two revolutions.|$|E

50|$|Gasoline (petrol) is a fuel {{used in a}} <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engine.</b> The fuel {{is mixed}} with air within its {{flammable}} limits and heated by compression and subject to Boyle's Law above its flash point, then ignited by the spark plug. To ignite, the fuel must have a low flash point, {{but in order to}} avoid preignition caused by residual heat in a hot combustion chamber, the fuel must have a high autoignition temperature.|$|E
50|$|Pre-ignition (or preignition) in a <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engine</b> is a {{technically}} different phenomenon from engine knocking, {{and describes}} the event wherein the air/fuel mixture in the cylinder ignites before the spark plug fires. Pre-ignition is initiated by an ignition source {{other than the}} spark, such as hot spots in the combustion chamber, a spark plug that runs too hot for the application, or carbonaceous deposits in the combustion chamber heated to incandescence by previous engine combustion events.|$|E
50|$|TEDOM was {{established}} as a limited liability company in 1991. It {{was established}} by Ing. Josef Jeleček.

The first CHP unit, the TEDOM MT 22 with an output of 22 kW that used the Škoda 781 four-cylinder <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engine</b> from the Škoda Favorit-model series passenger car, was put into operation this same year.|$|E
50|$|Dual Ignition is {{a system}} for <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engines,</b> whereby {{critical}} ignition components, such as spark plugs and magnetos, are duplicated. Dual ignition is most commonly employed on aero engines, and is sometimes found on cars and motorcycles.|$|R
40|$|Engine downsizing, {{which is}} the use of a smaller engine that {{provides}} the power of a larger engine, is now considered a mega-trend for the internal combustion engine market. It is usually achieved using one or more boosting devices including a supercharger or a turbocharger. Although supercharging is beneficial for engine's transient response, turbocharging technology is more widely adopted considering its advantages in fuel efficiency. Compared to turbocharged compression ignition <b>engines,</b> turbocharged <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engines</b> tend to be more challenging with respect to the gas exchange process mainly due to their higher pumping loss, the need for throttling and the fact that <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engines</b> demand more controllability due to the mitigation of knock, particularly with regard to minimizing trapped residuals. These challenges encourage the entire gas exchange process of turbocharged <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engines</b> to be regarded as a complete air management system instead of just looking at the boosting system in isolation. In addition, more research emphasis should be focused on novel approaches to improve the gas exchange process of downsized turbocharged <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engines</b> because the refinement of the conventional technologies cannot provide continuous gains indefinitely and only innovative concept may improve the engine performance to meet the fuel efficiency target and the more stringent emission regulation in the future. This article will first briefly review knowledge of {{the current state of the}} art technologies that are in production as opposed to approaches that are currently only being investigated at a research level. Next, more novel methods of the gas exchange process are introduced to identify the improved synergies between the engine and the boosting machine. The major findings to improve the gas exchange process that emerge from this review comprise four aspects (depending on the location where the novel technologies are implemented) which are as follows: charge air pressurization/de-pressurization improvement, combustion efficiency enhancement within the chamber, valve event-associated development and exhaust system optimization. Although the interaction between these technologies on different aspects of the gas exchange process was found to be highly complex, the optimization or the combination of these technologies is anticipated to further improve a downsized turbocharged <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engine's</b> performance...|$|R
25|$|Conventional diesel flash points vary between 52 and 96°C, {{which makes}} it safer than petrol and {{unsuitable}} for <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engines.</b> Unlike petrol, the flash point of a diesel fuel has no relation to its performance in an engine nor to its auto ignition qualities.|$|R
50|$|As well as {{the high}} level of {{compression}} allowing combustion to take place without a separate ignition system, a high compression ratio greatly increases the engine's efficiency. Increasing the compression ratio in a <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engine</b> where fuel and air are mixed before entry to the cylinder is limited by the need to prevent damaging pre-ignition. Since only air is compressed in a diesel engine, and fuel is not introduced into the cylinder until shortly before top dead centre (TDC), premature detonation is not a problem and compression ratios are much higher.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a normal}} <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engine,</b> the air-fuel mixture is heated due to being {{compressed}} and is then triggered to burn rapidly by the spark plug. During the combustion process, if the unburnt {{portion of the}} fuel in the combustion chamber is heated (or compressed) too much, pockets of unburnt fuel may self-ignite (detonate) before the main flame front reaches them. Shockwaves produced by detonation can cause much higher pressures than engine components are designed for, and can cause a [...] "knocking" [...] or [...] "pinging" [...] sound. Knocking can cause major engine damage if severe.|$|E
50|$|A tumble flap is a flap {{housed in}} the intake area of many modern {{automotive}} gasoline engines to produce a swirl at right-angles to the cylinder axis. This swirling motion improves the air-fuel mixture and enhances power and torque, {{while at the same}} time lowering fuel consumption and decreasing emissions. The flaps can be actuated with pneumatic or electric power. Furthermore, the position of the flap can be controlled continuously with a feedback controller or just kept either fully closed or open. Use of a tumble flap improves the lean burn ability of a <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E

Next part describes individual fuel types used to run <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engines</b> and their pros and cons. Analysis of exhaust emission particles produced during fuel combustion and it's regulation is covered in the next part. Final chapter provides a comparison of the in-fluence, octane number of the fuel has on the vehicle performance, based on data mea-sured in certified rollway test room.

5000|$|Heavier fuels like {{diesel fuel}} have higher cetane ratings and lower octane ratings, {{resulting}} in increased tendency to ignite spontaneously and burn {{completely in the}} cylinders when injected. Increased compression ratios create higher combustion chamber temperatures to ignite the injected fuel. Higher compression ratios increase pumping losses as more work is required to compress intake air to a smaller volume, but pumping loss increases are offset by increased power and efficiency. Increasing compression ratios in <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engines</b> requires higher octane fuels that are harder to ignite and burn completely and/or advanced spark timing to avoid pre-ignition, knocking and resulting performance losses and engine damage. Power gains from increased compression ratios are reduced in <b>spark-ignition</b> <b>engines</b> while the pumping losses remain comparable to similar compression ratio increases in diesel engines.|$|R
