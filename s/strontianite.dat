5|$|In {{the hills}} {{to the north}} of the village of Strontian the mineral <b>strontianite</b> was discovered, from which the element {{strontium}} was first isolated by Sir Humphry Davy in 1808.|$|E
5|$|Strontium {{commonly}} {{occurs in}} nature, being the 15th most abundant element on Earth (its heavier congener barium being the 14th), estimated to average approximately 360parts per {{million in the}} Earth's crust and is found chiefly as the sulfate mineral celestine (SrSO4) and the carbonate <b>strontianite</b> (SrCO3). Of the two, celestine occurs much more frequently in deposits of sufficient size for mining. Because strontium is used most often in the carbonate form, <b>strontianite</b> would be the more useful of the two common minerals, but few deposits have been discovered that are suitable for development.|$|E
5|$|Because of its extreme {{reactivity}} {{with oxygen}} and water, strontium occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements, {{such as in}} the minerals <b>strontianite</b> and celestine. It is kept under a liquid hydrocarbon such as mineral oil or kerosene to prevent oxidation; freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a yellowish color with the formation of the oxide. Finely powdered strontium metal is pyrophoric, meaning that it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature. Volatile strontium salts impart a bright red color to flames, and these salts are used in pyrotechnics and in the production of flares. Like calcium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, strontium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
5|$|Both {{strontium}} and <b>strontianite</b> {{are named}} after Strontian, {{a village in}} Scotland near which the mineral was discovered in 1790 by Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank; it {{was identified as a}} new element the next year from its crimson-red flame test color. Strontium was first isolated as a metal in 1808 by Humphry Davy using the then-newly discovered process of electrolysis. The production of sugar from sugar beet was in the 19th century the largest application of strontium (see strontian process). At the peak of production of television cathode ray tubes, as much as 75 percent of strontium consumption in the United States was used for the faceplate glass. With the displacement of cathode ray tubes by other display methods, consumption of strontium has dramatically declined.|$|E
5|$|Strontium is the {{chemical}} element with symbolSr and atomic number38. An alkaline earth metal, strontium is a soft silver-white yellowish metallic element {{that is highly}} reactive chemically. The metal forms a dark oxide layer when it is exposed to air. Strontium has {{physical and chemical properties}} similar to those of its two vertical neighbors in the periodic table, calcium and barium. It occurs naturally in the minerals celestine, <b>strontianite,</b> and putnisite, and is mined mostly from the first two of these. While natural strontium is stable, the synthetic 90Sr isotope is radioactive {{and is one of the}} most dangerous components of nuclear fallout, as strontium is absorbed by the body in a similar manner to calcium. Natural stable strontium, on the other hand, is not hazardous to health.|$|E
500|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{application of}} strontium {{was in the}} production of sugar from sugar beet. Although a crystallisation process using strontium hydroxide was patented by Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1849 the large scale introduction came with the improvement of the process in the early 1870s. The German sugar industry used the process well into the 20th century. Before World War I the beet sugar industry used [...] 100,000 to 150,000 tons of strontium hydroxide for this process per year. The strontium hydroxide was recycled in the process, but the demand to substitute losses during production was high enough to create a significant demand initiating mining of <b>strontianite</b> in the Münsterland. The [...] mining of <b>strontianite</b> in Germany ended when mining of the celestine deposits in Gloucestershire started. These mines supplied most of the world strontium supply from 1884 to 1941. Although the celestine deposits in the Granada basin were known for some time the large scale mining did not start before the 1950s.|$|E
500|$|Strontium {{is named}} after the Scottish village of Strontian (Gaelic Sròn an t-Sìthein), where it was {{discovered}} in the ores of the lead mines. In 1790, Adair Crawford, a physician engaged {{in the preparation of}} barium, and his colleague William Cruickshank, recognised that the Strontian ores exhibited properties that differed from those in other [...] "heavy spars" [...] sources. This allowed Adair to conclude on page 355 [...] "...it is probable indeed, that the scotch mineral is a new species of earth which has not hitherto been sufficiently examined." [...] The physician and mineral collector Friedrich Gabriel Sulzer analysed together with Johann Friedrich Blumenbach the mineral from Strontian and named it <b>strontianite.</b> He also {{came to the conclusion that}} it was distinct from the witherite and contained a new earth (neue Grunderde). In 1793 Thomas Charles Hope, a professor of chemistry at the University of Glasgow proposed the name [...] strontites. [...] He confirmed the earlier work of Crawford and recounted: [...] "...Considering it a peculiar earth I thought it necessary to give it an name. I have called it Strontites, from the place it was found; a mode of derivation in my opinion, fully as proper as any quality it may possess, which is the present fashion." [...] The element was eventually isolated by Sir Humphry Davy in 1808 by the electrolysis of a mixture containing strontium chloride and mercuric oxide, and announced by him in a lecture to the Royal Society on 30 June 1808. In keeping with the naming of the other alkaline earths, he changed the name to strontium.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Strontianite</b> {{is almost}} always fluorescent. [...] It fluoresces bright {{yellowish}} white under shortwave, mediumwave and longwave ultraviolet radiation. If the luminescence persists after the ultraviolet source is switched off the sample {{is said to be}} phosphorescent. Most <b>strontianite</b> phosphoresces a strong, medium duration, yellowish white after exposure to all three wavelengths. [...] It is also fluorescent and phosphorescent in X-rays and electron beams. All materials will glow red hot if they are heated to a high enough temperature (provided they do not decompose first); some materials become luminescent at much lower temperatures, and this is known as thermoluminescence. <b>Strontianite</b> is sometimes thermoluminescent.|$|E

5000|$|The mineral {{was named}} in 1791 for the locality, Strontian, Argyllshire, Scotland, where the element {{strontium}} {{had been discovered}} the previous year. [...] Although good mineral specimens of <b>strontianite</b> are rare, strontium is a fairly common element, with abundance in the Earth's crust of 370 parts per million by weight, 87 parts per million by moles, much more common than copper with only 60 parts per million by weight, 19 by moles. Strontium is never found free in nature. The principal strontium ores are celestine SrSO4 and <b>strontianite</b> SrCO3. The main commercial process for strontium metal production is reduction of strontium oxide with aluminium.|$|E
50|$|<b>Strontianite</b> is {{colourless}}, white, gray, light yellow, {{green or}} brown, colourless in transmitted light. It may be longitudinally zoned. It is transparent to translucent, with a vitreous (glassy) lustre, resinous on broken surfaces, {{and a white}} streak.|$|E
50|$|The main {{mineral deposit}} is limestone, which is quarried in Beckum and Ennigerloh in large {{quantities}} and used by the cement industry in the area. Formerly, <b>strontianite</b> was also mined and used as a whitener for the sugar industry.|$|E
50|$|Taseqite's type {{locality}} is the Taseq slope {{located in}} the Ilimaussaq complex, Greenland - hence its name. At the type locality taseqite occurs in albitite veins, together with aegirine, analcime, catapleiite, ferrobustamite, hemimorphite, pectolite (silicates); ancylite-(La), calcite, dolomite, <b>strontianite</b> (carbonates); fluorapatite, and sphalerite.|$|E
50|$|The strontian {{process is}} an {{obsolete}} chemical method to recover sugar from molasses. Its use in Europe peaked {{in the middle}} of the 19th century. The name strontian comes from the Scottish village Strontian where the source mineral <b>strontianite</b> (strontium carbonate) was first found.|$|E
50|$|Yet by 1883, {{the demand}} on <b>strontianite</b> {{had begun to}} shrink. Firstly, it was {{replaced}} by another strontium mineral (celestine), that could be imported from England, in a cheaper way. Secondly, the prices for sugar decreased so much, that the production from molasses was no longer worthwhile.|$|E
50|$|If {{the colour}} of the {{incident}} light is changed, then the refractive indices are modified, {{and the value of}} 2V changes. This is known as dispersion of the optic axes. For <b>strontianite</b> the effect is weak, with 2V larger for violet light than for red light r < v.|$|E
50|$|It {{occurs in}} an igneous {{carbonatite}} sill in Montreal, Canada in the Francon Quarry {{where it was}} first discovered. It also occurs in the Mont Saint-Hilaire district.
