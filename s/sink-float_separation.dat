Mechanical separationoriented characterisation of WEEE was conducted in an attempt to evaluate the amenability of mechanical separation processes. Properties such as liberation degree of fractions (plastics, metals ferrous and non-ferrous), which are essential for mechanical separation, are analysed by means of a grain counting approach. Two different samples from different recycling industries were characterised in this work. The first sample is a heterogeneous material containing different types of plastics, metals (ferrous and non-ferrous), printed circuit board (PCB), rubber and wood. The second sample contains a mixture of mainly plastics. It is found for the first sample that all aluminium particles are free (100 %) in all investigated size fractions. Between 92 % and 95 % of plastics are present as free particles; however, 67 % in average of ferromagnetic particles are liberated. It can be observed that only 42 % of ferromagnetic particles are free in the size fraction larger than 20 mm. Particle shapes were also quantified manually particle by particle. The results show that the particle shapes as a result of shredding, turn out to be heterogeneous, thereby complicating mechanical separation processes. In addition, the separability of various materials was ascertained by a sink-float analysis and eddy current separation. The second sample was separated by automatic sensor sorting in four different products: ABS, PC-ABS, PS and rest product. The fractions were characterised by using the methodology described in this paper. The results show that the grade and liberation degree of the plastic products ABS, PC-ABS and PS are close to 100 %. <b>Sink-float</b> <b>separation</b> and infrared plastic identification equipment confirms the high plastic quality.

40|$|Abstract: The cut-density of <b>sink-float</b> <b>separations</b> with {{water-based}} magnetic liquids linearly {{depends on}} the magnetization of the process liquid. The control of the magnetization of the liquid, by means of measurement followed by extraction {{of water from the}} process liquid by membranes or mixing with water or concentrated magnetic liquid, is therefore a critical part of the technology. A potential problem with mixing-in concentrated magnetic liquid is that the process liquid may become inhomogeneous and will segregate in the magnetic field region. Mixing experiments for various scenarios were carried out on a simplified experimental process line and magnetization levels were compared with theoretical models. The results show as process liquid segregation, due to incomplete mixing, can be avoided for all conceivable control strategies by using static mixers. A measurement tool based on a magneto-gravimetric principle was shown to have sufficient sensitivity to detect and control fluctuations of the magnetization of such a fluid in an industrial environment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{amount of}} waste {{electrical}} and electronic equipment (WEEE) {{will continue to}} increase in the coming decades with an expected rate of at least 4 %/y, about three times higher than the growth of the average municipal waste because the market of the {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (EEE) is growing very fast. in the world. Innovative separation and beneficiation techniques of various materials encountered in WEEE waste is a major improvement for WEEE recycling. In this context, mechanical separation-oriented characterization of these wastes was conducted in an attempt to evaluate the flexibility of mechanical separation processes. A new methodology of characterisation was developed in BRGM. It is consisted on the sampling step followed by particle size distribution. Each size fraction is analysed manually to determine the colour, shape and liberation degrees of various products (plastics, metals ferrous and non-ferrous), which are essential for mechanical separation, were analysed by means of a grain counting approach. To identify the types of plastics, a mobile Phazir plastic detector based on IR spectroscopy was used, and the combination of magnetic and eddy current separations was performed to quantify ferrous and non-ferrous particles. The bromine was analysed by the instrument operates on the principle of x-ray fluorescence (Niton). Two different samples from different recycling industries were characterised in this work. The first sample is heterogeneous material containing different types of plastics, metals (ferrous and non-ferrous), printed circuit board (PCB), rubber, wood, etc. The second sample contains mostly plastics with high content of ABS. It is found that all aluminium particles are free (100 %) in all investigated size fractions. Between 92 and 95 % of plastics are present as free particles; however 67 % in average of ferromagnetic particles are liberated. It can be observed that only 42 % of ferromagnetic particles are free in the size fraction higher than 20 mm. Particle shapes were also quantified manually particle by particle.
