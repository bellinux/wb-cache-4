To record the TEM images for analysis, electron microscopists have used specialized electron micrograph film for a long time, until the new developments in TEM, such as electron tomography and cryo- electron microscopy, pushed for the needs of digital imaging. Recent years has seen the widespread use of the charge coupled device (CCD) in all fields of TEM. Although it does provide digital readout, its spatial resolution and sensitivity are fundamentally limited by the use of an indirect detection method based on scintillator screens to convert high energy electrons into photons. To realize the full imaging potential of the TEM, a new imaging detector for TEM, called the Direct Detection Device (DDD), was designed, built and characterized. The DDD is capable of directly detecting high energy electrons with a high signal to noise ratio, ensuring <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> sensitivity. Thanks to the small 5 μm pixel size, the spatial resolution of the DDD exceeds any current imaging detectors in the TEM.

40|$|We report {{real-time}} {{detection of}} the single charges that constitute a small electrical current, as they flow through a nano-electronic device. This represents a direct demonstration of charge discreteness in an electrical current. In a chain of small metallic islands connected by tunnel junctions (allowing electrons to pass by quantum tunnelling), Coulomb repulsion imposes a spatial correlation between <b>single</b> <b>electrons</b> which occupy different islands. When a current I flows through this chain, these electrons move in concert, and tunnel in a temporally correlated way at the average frequency f_e=I/e, where e is the electronic charge. We {{have been able to}} detect this time-correlated, single-electron tunnelling by combining such a chain with an ultrasensitive charge detector, a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (RF-SET). Two different ways of connecting the chain to the SET were investigated. We ultimately measured currents in the range 5 fA- 1 pA by counting the <b>single</b> <b>electrons.</b> We found that the line width of the spectral peak is nearly proportional to the frequency f_e of the oscillations, in good agreement between experimental data and numerical calculations. The tunnelling of the <b>single</b> <b>electrons</b> took place while the islands were in the superconducting state, but the inter-island Josephson coupling was low. Cooper pairs were also easily broken into quasiparticles as the magnetic field was relatively strong. Under these conditions, we have additionally observed a crossover to time-correlated, incoherent tunnelling of individual Cooper pairs as a function of decreased magnetic field and of current. Tunnelling dominated by Cooper pairs now produces a frequency f_ 2 e=I/ 2 e. We have found that the two types of tunnelling can coexist in an intermediate state, producing an average tunnelling frequency between f_e and f_ 2 e. In a similar way, we have also attempted to directly observe Bloch oscillations in a one-dimensional array of small Josephson junctions, that is, the coherent, time-correlated tunnelling of Cooper pairs. This fundamentally new way to measure small currents has the advantage of being self-calibrated, since the only parameter involved is the natural constant e.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} a fabrication process for an Aluminum <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> transistor, experimental results verifying its functionality, and its integration on the tip of a scanning probe for scanning probe microscopy. When an electron passes through a tunnel barrier, it changes the barrier's capacitance, which in turn builds up a voltage across the barrier. If the thermal activation energy is smaller than the charging energy, and the barrier resistance sufficiently suppresses quantum fluctuations, then this voltage buildup prevents any further electrons from tunneling. In other words, to be able to observe <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> charging effects in a tunnel barrier, its capacitance C must so small that the charging energy e 2 / 2 C is larger than the thermal energy kBT and the quantum fluctuations h/T=h/RC. If those conditions are observed, then tunneling is blocked, the current is suppressed, the conductance drops, and the device is in Coulomb blockade. A <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> transistor is a <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> charging effect based device, where two tunnel barriers are connected in series, defining a small island between them. This suppresses the quantum-mechanical uncertainty of the electron location. A gate is capacitively coupling to the island as third electrode. If the energies allow for observation of <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> charging effects, and a bias voltage is applied across the two tunnel barriers, then electrons may tunnel through both of them, resulting in a current, given that the tunnel barriers are not in Coulomb blockade. This is determined by the voltage applied to the gate electrode. A small change in the external polarization charge on the gate electrode (by fractions of the elementary charge) may move the <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> transistor from a conductive state into Coulomb blockade and vice versa. The current voltage characteristic of a <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> transistor is e-periodic with the gate voltage, since increasing the gate voltage allows {{to increase the number of}} electrons on the island one by one. A process to fabricate <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> transistors was developed from scratch, employing the double angle Niemeyer-Dolan evaporation technique. A resist stack of poly(methyl-methacrylate) on top of copolymer was exposed with an electron beam lithography system. Resistively heated thermally evaporated Al was controlledly oxidized, followed by a second Al evaporation step at a different inclination angle. The overlap of the two evaporation steps defines the tunnel junction area. The device's functionality was successfully tested in a 4 He and a 3 He- 4 He dilution cryostat for normal conductive and superconductive states. Given that <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> transistor is very sensitive to change in charge, the scanning of a <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> transistor over a sample allows to map the change in charge, or charge distribution. The change in gate electrode polarization is measured by the change in current in the <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> transistor. In short, the current in the scanning <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> transistor changes because the capacitive coupling between the gate electrode and charges in the sample changes. Such a tool is intended to be used for local probe experiments, such as to probe the electric potentials and fields of device built in a two dimensional electron gas. A self-sensing and self-actuating quartz tuning fork based atomic force microscope probe was chosen as a platform for the implementation of the scanning <b>single</b> <b>electron</b> transistor.
