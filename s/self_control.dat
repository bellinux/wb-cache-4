25|$|The Bene Gesserit {{develop their}} {{physical}} abilities {{as well as}} their mental abilities. A trained Sister has full control over each muscle in her body through training known as prana-bindu. This allows her to bend the last joint in her little toe while remaining otherwise motionless, bend and contort her body in ways that most would consider impossible, or put a remarkable amount of force behind a physical blow. The mental part of prana-bindu, or prana-nervature (prana stands for breath, bindu stands for musculature) is the precise control of the totality of nerves in the human body. In Dune, Reverend Mother Mohiam tests Paul with a nerve induction device ("the box") that causes the sensation of intense pain. Paul learns that he {{is not the only one}} to have tried it, but is perhaps specially resistant; this conversation points to a widespread use of it as a tool among the Bene Gesserit to measure <b>self</b> <b>control,</b> nerve control, and as Mohiam puts it, crisis and observation.|$|E

500|$|Cunningham saw much {{action in}} the interwar years. In 1919, he {{commanded}} the S-class destroyer Seafire, on duty in the Baltic. The Communists, the White Russians, several varieties of Latvian nationalists, Germans, and the Poles [...] were trying to control Latvia; the British Government had recognised Latvia's independence after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. It was on this voyage that Cunningham first met Admiral Walter Cowan. Cunningham was impressed by Cowan's methods, specifically his navigation of the potentially dangerous seas, with thick fog and minefields threatening the fleet. Throughout several potentially problematic encounters with German forces trying to undermine the Latvian independence movement, Cunningham exhibited [...] "good <b>self</b> <b>control</b> and judgement". Cowan {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "Commander Cunningham has on one occasion after another acted with unfailing promptitude and decision, and has proved himself an Officer of exceptional valour and unerring resolution." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{approach}} {{is made by}} the social bond or social control theory. Instead of looking for factors that make people become criminal, these theories try to explain why people do not become criminal. Travis Hirschi identified four main characteristics: [...] "attachment to others", [...] "belief in moral validity of rules", [...] "commitment to achievement", and [...] "involvement in conventional activities". [...] The more a person features those characteristics, the less likely (s)he is to become deviant (or criminal). [...] On the other hand, if these factors are not present, a person {{is more likely to}} become a criminal. Hirschi expanded on this theory with the idea that a person with low <b>self</b> <b>control</b> is more likely to become criminal.|$|E
2500|$|Consumption of {{a tempting}} food by non-clinical {{individuals}} increases when self-regulatory resources are previously depleted by another task, {{suggesting that it}} {{is caused by a}} breakdown in <b>self</b> <b>control.</b> [...] Impulsive eating of unhealthy snack foods appears to be regulated by individual differences in impulsivity when self-control is weak and by attitudes towards the snack and towards healthy eating when self-control is strong. There is also evidence that greater food consumption occurs when people are in a sad mood, although it is possible that this is due more to emotional regulation than to a lack of self-control. In these cases, overeating will only take place if the food is palatable to the person, and if so individual differences in impulsivity can predict the amount of consumption.|$|E

She went further by stating that she feels Blizzard Entertainment, the game's developer, structures the game to be deliberately addictive and designs it to keep people in. While she agreed that other personal issues can have an effect she felt that the cause of the problem was what she described as the game's [...] "inherent addictiveness". Describing the addiction as similar to gambling, Orzack cited variable-ratio reinforcement as the mechanism that keeps people playing. Continuing, she added that she feels willpower or <b>self</b> <b>control</b> is not a factor, and that MMORPGs like World of Warcraft should carry warnings in a similar way to cigarettes. There was disagreement about Orzack's conclusions, with it being described a [...] "ridiculous claim" [...] that an addiction to an enjoyable activity and describe it a “serious mental disorder”.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on the risk of first acute myocardial infarction (MI). Design: Case - control analysis and a <b>self</b> <b>controlled</b> case series. Setting: 644 general practices throughout England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Patients: Over 60 000 cases of MI and 360 000 age, sex, and practice matched controls randomly selected from the UK General Practice Research Database. Main outcome measures: Matched odds ratios and incidence rate ratios estimating {{whether there is an}} acute or prolonged increased risk of MI after exposure to TCA and SSRI drugs and individual drugs within these families. Results: Case - control analysis found an initial increased risk of MI after TCA exposure (for example, at 1 - 7 days after the first dothiepin prescription: odds ratio (OR) 1. 90, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 15 to 3. 14) or SSRI exposure (for example, at 1 - 7 days after first fluoxetine prescription: OR 2. 59, 95 % CI 1. 44 to 4. 66). In the <b>self</b> <b>controlled</b> analysis the equivalent risk estimates were an incidence rate ratio of 1. 43, 95 % CI 0. 92 to 2. 22 for dothiepin and an incidence rate ratio of 1. 66, 95 % CI 1. 01 to 2. 71 for fluoxetine. Conclusions: Antidepressant prescriptions are associated with an increased risk of MI. The size of these effects is similar for TCA and SSRI exposures; however, the lack of specificity between types of antidepressants and the lower risks found in the <b>self</b> <b>controlled</b> analysis suggest that these associations are more likely due to factors relating to underlying depression and health services utilisation than to specific adverse drug effects...|$|R
40|$|To {{test whether}} delayed {{autonomous}} selfing occurs in Kosteletzkya virginica, stylar movements, delayed autonomous <b>selfing,</b> corolla dragging, <b>controlling</b> pollination and autogamy rate were experimentally studied. The {{results indicated that}} delayed autonomous selfing and corolla dragging occur in K. virginica. Recurvature of stylar branches lasted until the stigmas touched or abutted on the anthers {{at the end of}} the anthesis day, only if stigmas did not received pollen from an external agent. However, recurvature stopped if stigmas received pollen from an external agent. Delayed autonomous selfing was due to direct stylar movements if stigmas touched with the anthers {{at the end of the}} anthesis day, or to the combination of corolla dragging with stylar movements if stigmas abutted on the anthers. The results of experimental hand pollinations indicated that K. virginica has a well-developed capacity for selfing, because the fruit set of natural and hand self-pollination were similar to hand cross-pollination. There were significant differences in the mean number of seeds per capsule for natural <b>selfing,</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>selfing</b> and <b>controlled</b> crossing (F 2, 57 = 234. 877, P < 0. 001).

40|$|A {{systematic}} and <b>self</b> <b>controlled</b> prototype filter design approach for multichannel Cosine Modulated Near Perfect Reconstruction (NPR) filter bank is proposed in this paper. The {{primary goal is}} to design a prototype filter with enhanced performance i. e., minimum amplitude distortion and aliasing error. This algorithm approximates 3 dB cutoff frequency very close to π/ 2 M. This is achieved by selecting suitable step size which {{is a function of}} transition width. If the selection of step size is too fine, the objective function oscillates. Whereas, if step size is coarse, 3 dB cutoff frequency will not be close to π/ 2 M. This will degrade the overall performance of the prototype filter. Thus by choosing the step size as a function of transition width and varying the step size from coarser to finer level, the minimum amplitude distortion and aliasing error can be definitely achieved. The proposed filter is designed using two input parameters: number of subbands M and attenuation A and all other system parameters are derived from it to avoid heuristic inputs. Simulation results indicate better performance with reference to algorithms existing in literature. In addition, the design approach is {{systematic and}} <b>self</b> <b>controlled...</b>|$|R

40|$|Variable {{compression}} ratio enables an engine to achieve increased efficiency at part loads, {{where the majority}} of driving occurs, without sacrificing full load power requirements or increasing the risk of engine knock. Although over 100 patents and patent applications exist none of these systems has been commercialized yet due to issues related to feasibility, cost and frictional loss. A new approach of a <b>self</b> <b>controlling</b> variable {{compression ratio}} connecting rod is presented that does not need a friction intensive external activation and that could even be retrofitted. The potential in fuel consumption and exhaust emission reduction as well as increased power and torque output for this concept has been verified in combustion simulations utilizing the latest research results related to the dynamic heat transfer in the combustion chamber from Professor Kleinschmidt from the University of Siegen, Germany. The <b>self</b> <b>controlling</b> variable compression ratio connecting rod allows the con rod to compress at high load conditions thereby increasing cylinder volume to alleviate combustion pressures and temperatures and therefore limit knock onset. The biggest efficiency gains can be achieved at medium load where the reduction of heat loss during the compression of the connecting rod plays a major role additional to the well known efficiency gains of an increased compression ratio. The combustion simulation results shows fuel consumption can be reduced by between 3 % and 5 % during part load and wide open throttle operation at various engine speeds. Emissions are also reduced significantly; particularly NOx and CO emissions were reduced by up to 35 %.
