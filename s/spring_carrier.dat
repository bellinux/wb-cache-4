50|$|When {{the thumb}} stud is pushed forward the slide and left <b>spring</b> <b>carrier</b> {{are free to}} travel. This {{increases}} tension on the main spring as the blade and right <b>spring</b> <b>carrier</b> are locked. A ramp on the slide impinges on the lower pin. When the pin evacuates the notch the blade and right <b>spring</b> <b>carrier</b> are free to move. The right <b>spring</b> <b>carrier</b> moves only a short distance before it comes {{to rest in the}} slide. Momentum carries the blade further before flanges (not shown) retard its motion.|$|E
50|$|Another {{restraining}} pin {{at position}} 3 fits into a notch and locks the blade in the extended position. A tab {{on the left}} <b>spring</b> <b>carrier</b> fits into {{a hole in the}} blade at position 4 which restrains the left <b>spring</b> <b>carrier.</b> This allows reverse force on the thumb stud to increase tension in the main spring before the upper restraining pin releases and the blade and carrier can return to the closed position.|$|E
50|$|The {{knife blade}} (dark grey) {{is locked in}} {{position}} by a spring-loaded restraining pin (yellow and red) fitting into a notch in the blade at position 1. The two spring carriers (green) fit into the spaces on the slide (blue) and this assembly rests {{to the side of}} the blade. The right <b>spring</b> <b>carrier</b> is restrained by a tab at position 2 that fits over the end of the blade. Tension on the main spring (red zig-zag) holds the other <b>spring</b> <b>carrier,</b> slide and thumb stud (light grey) to the right.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Background The {{goal of a}} {{lower limb}} {{prosthesis}} is to restore the abilities of the intact limb for an amputee. Daily ambulation includes many maneuvers such as turning, pivoting, and uncertain terrain, all of which require a component of transverse plane mobility. It {{has been shown that}} the addition of a transverse plane adaptor can help to decrease soft tissue damage, increase mobility, and help reduce the risk of falls in amputees. However, currently available transverse plane adaptors only allow for a single stiffness setting and do not allow for variation to accommodate the maneuvers of everyday ambulation. The aim of this research was to design, build, and test a prototype lower limb prosthetic adaptor that is capable of variable stiffness in the transverse plane. The device will be used to better understand the role transverse stiffness plays in varying daily ambulation activities such as walking and turning. Design A variable stiffness torsion device (VSTA) was designed, and built and is capable of controlling stiffness in the transverse plane of a lower limb prosthesis. Design criteria were established to determine structural and functional requirements for the VSTA. A custom spring was designed with a rate of 0. 33 Nm/° allowing for VSTA settings between 0. 10 - 1. 17 Nm/°, and includes a locked infinitely stiff setting. Refinement of the design was then conducted using a mathematical model, finite element analysis (FEA), and analysis of VSTA kinematics. Following design completion, a prototype was built and tested. Mechanical Testing Mechanical bench testing was performed to determine the physical capabilities of the VSTA. The VSTA is actually capable of infinite stiffness variation between 0. 12 - 0. 91 Nm/°. Initial designs accounted for the internal spring to be capable of 90 ° of deflection which would have allowed for infinite stiffness variation between the minimum and infinitely stiff, however, internal spring stresses limited spring deflection to 57 °, resulting in the limited range of the VSTA. The bench testing showed that the VSTA as designed and manufactured would be suitable for human subjects testing. Controller Testing A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, provided by the motor manufacturer, was used to control step inputs of the <b>spring</b> <b>carrier</b> to adjust the stiffness of the VSTA. The controller, using a 16 volt supply, could accurately perform step inputs, but could not meet rate of performance design goals. When supply voltage was brought up to the ideal 24 volts the controller was able to meet the rate goals of the VSTA, however, over power faults occurred resulting in incomplete step controls. Use of a different control module that would allow for the full 24 volt supply to the motor and with consideration of the reduced functional range of the VSTA it is estimated that the controller would meet all design goals. Future Work Structurally the VSTA needs to be improved beyond the factor of safety of one to provide a more robust solution. Mechanical improvements include increasing VSTA ability to apply and sustain higher stiffness settings without being limited by overstress of the spring. It would also be beneficial to test the VSTA for use as an active stiffness generator, modulating stiffness while under load. Additionally, the controller could be developed to better optimize the gains, and possibly increase speed and performance of the system. Lastly, human subjects testing should be conducted to better evaluate the VSTA's ability to function in a real setting, as well as to better understand the role of transverse plane stiffness during ambulation...|$|E
40|$|The gradual {{liberalisation}} of China's {{air transport}} sector {{led to the}} launch of some new private airlines and low cost carriers (LCCs) in the mid- 2000 s. However, the large population and geographic market do {{not necessarily mean that}} a conducive environment is ensured for the growth of these new airlines. The domestic market is still dominated by the three state-owned carriers that have access to government aid whenever they are in trouble. Despite the less favourable environment, China's only low cost <b>carrier</b> <b>Spring</b> Airlines has managed to grow and achieved limited success. The presence of Spring Airlines on a domestic route has contributed to an increase in passenger volume by 23 %, holding other factors constant. This study also finds that when the jet fuel price increases by one dollar per gallon, the number of passengers carried will drop by 6 %. The tourism and economic benefits brought about by LCCs should be the driving forces for the change in air transport policies in China. ...|$|R
50|$|The FAL {{operates}} {{by means}} of a gas-operated action very {{similar to that of the}} Russian SVT-40. The gas system is driven by a short-stroke, spring-loaded piston housed above the barrel, and the locking mechanism is what is known as a tilting breechblock. To lock, it drops down into a solid shoulder of metal in the heavy receiver much like the bolts of the Russian SKS carbine and French MAS-49 series of semi-automatic rifles. The gas system is fitted with a gas regulator behind the front sight base, allowing adjustment of the gas system in response to environmental conditions. The piston system can be bypassed completely, using the gas plug, to allow for the firing of rifle grenades and manual operation. The FAL's magazine capacity ranges from five to 30 rounds, with most magazines holding 20 rounds. In fixed stock versions of the FAL, the recoil spring is housed in the stock, while in folding-stock versions it is housed in the receiver cover, necessitating a slightly different receiver cover, recoil <b>spring,</b> and bolt <b>carrier,</b> and a modified lower receiver for the stock.|$|R
5000|$|Interest in {{the airport}} has been {{expressed}} by the Malaysian carrier Air Asia X as well as Korean airline Asiana, but only the latter has committed to flying out of the airport on a fixed basis. TransAsia Airways has committed to flights to and from Taipei's Taoyuan Airport on a semi-regular basis from March to May. During the May holiday, charters to Guam, Cebu, Bali, and Hainan will operate out of the airport. Also, China-based low-cost <b>carrier</b> <b>Spring</b> Airlines has chosen this airport as its Tokyo-area destination with its recent approval for international flying. It planned to run three charter flights a week from Shanghai-Pudong starting from {{about the end of}} July 2010 for about two months, switching to scheduled flights {{at the end of this}} period (around the end of the World Expo). However, it has started selling seats on the charters in the same manner as a normal flight since September 2010, much like the early Hongqiao-Haneda [...] "scheduled charters" [...] and has operated the flight as a scheduled service starting from 2011. In addition, it has now increased service to five flights a week.|$|R
