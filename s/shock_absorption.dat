5|$|On {{water-based}} pitches, shorter fibres and wetted turf reduce {{friction and}} increase {{the speed at which}} the game can be played. However, these pitches require watering before, during and after the game and maintenance costs are significant. Sand-dressed pitches cost more than sand-filled pitches but are preferable for hockey as there is an absence of sand close to the playing surface. However, a multi-purpose surface suitable for sports including association football and tennis is often required and hockey may not be the predominant sport. There are many different specifications and categorisations for artificial turf including <b>shock</b> <b>absorption,</b> surface rebound, friction, and strength outlined by the International Hockey Federation. Recently, longer-pile third-generation or 3G pitches have become popular, especially for football, but these do not usually meet the FIH's test criteria; they are often too inconsistent and slow.|$|E
5|$|The {{limbs of}} the horse are {{structures}} made of dozens of bones, joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments that support {{the weight of the}} equine body. They include two apparatuses: the suspensory apparatus, which carries much of the weight, prevents overextension of the joint and absorbs shock, and the stay apparatus, which locks major joints in the limbs, allowing horses to remain standing while relaxed or asleep. The limbs play a major part in the movement {{of the horse}}, with the legs performing the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. In general, the majority of the weight is borne by the front legs, while the rear legs provide propulsion. The hooves are also important structures, providing support, traction and <b>shock</b> <b>absorption,</b> and containing structures which provide blood flow through the lower leg. As the horse developed as a cursorial animal, with a primary defense mechanism of running over hard ground, its legs evolved to the long, sturdy, light-weight, one-toed form seen today.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some <b>shock</b> <b>absorption</b> on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The hoof of {{the horse}} {{contains}} over a dozen different structures, including bones, cartilage, tendons and tissues. The coffin or pedal bone is the major hoof bone, supporting {{the majority of the}} weight. Under the coffin bone is the navicular bone, itself cushioned by the navicular bursa, a fluid-filled sac. The digital cushion is a blood vessel-filled structure located {{in the middle of the}} hoof, which assists with blood flow throughout the leg. At the top of the hoof wall is the corium, tissue which continually produces the horn of the outer hoof shell, which is in turn protected by the periople, a thin outer layer which prevents the interior structures from drying out. The wall is connected to the coffin bone by sensitive laminae, a flexible layer which helps to suspend and protect the coffin bone. The main tendon in the hoof is the deep digital flexor tendon, which connects to the bottom of the coffin bone. The impact zone on the bottom of the hoof includes the sole, which has an outer, insensitive layer and a sensitive inner layer, and the frog, which lies between the heels and assists in <b>shock</b> <b>absorption</b> and blood flow. The final structures are the lateral cartilages, connected to the upper coffin bone, which act as the flexible heels, allowing hoof expansion. These structures allow the hoof to perform many functions. It acts as a support and traction point, shock absorber and system for pumping blood back through the lower limb.|$|E

25|$|The {{wheels and}} basket of the chariot were usually of wood, {{strengthened}} in places with bronze or iron. They had {{from four to}} eight spokes and tires of bronze or iron. Due to the widely spaced spokes, {{the rim of the}} chariot wheel was held in tension over comparatively large spans. Whilst this provided a small measure of <b>shock</b> <b>absorption,</b> it also necessitated the removal of the wheels when the chariot was not in use, to prevent warping from continued weight bearing.

40|$|Archival IUE {{observations}} of 31 Cygni at phases at which its sister Zeta Aurigae systems exhibit {{evidence of an}} accretion wake are discussed.

The detection of high-velocity absorption due to C IV but not N V implies a shock temperature lower than that of Zeta Aur and 22 Vul but higher than than of 32 Cygni. The dependence of the high-velocity absorption component on phase is consistent with a simple model for the shock structure. The reverse P Cygni profiles in the high-temperature lines are weak and the emission components are observed only at the times when the accretion <b>shock</b> cone <b>absorption</b> is detected.

40|$|International audienceA dense {{amorphous}} form of silica {{was prepared}} at high {{pressure from the}} highly compressible, siliceous zeolite, silicalite- 1 -F. Reverse Monte Carlo modeling of total X-ray scattering data shows that the structure of this novel amorphous form of SiO 2 recovered under ambient conditions is distinct from vitreous SiO 2 and retains the basic framework topology (i. e., chemical bonds) of the starting crystalline zeolite. This material is, however, amorphous over the different length scales probed by Raman and X-ray scattering due to strong geometrical distortions. This is thus an example of new topologically ordered, amorphous material with a different intermediate-range structure, a lower entropy {{with respect to a}} standard glass, and distinct physical and mechanical properties, eventually approaching those of an “ordered” or “perfect” glass. The same process in more complex aluminosilicate zeolites will, in addition, lead to an amorphous material which conserves the framework topology and chemical order of the crystal.

25|$|Road {{bicycles}} for racing {{tend to have}} a steeper {{seat tube}} angle, measured from the horizontal plane. This positions the rider aerodynamically and arguably in a stronger stroking position. The trade-off is comfort. Touring and comfort bicycles tend to have more slack seat tube angle traditionally. This positions the rider more on the sit bones and takes weight off the wrists, arms and neck, and, for men, improves circulation to the urinary and reproductive areas. With a slacker angle, designers lengthen the chainstay so that the center of gravity (that would otherwise be farther to the back over the wheel) is more ideally repositioned over the middle of the bike frame. The longer wheelbase contributes to effective <b>shock</b> <b>absorption.</b> In modern mass-manufactured touring and comfort bikes, the seat-tube angle is negligibly slacker, perhaps in order to reduce manufacturing costs by avoiding the need to reset welding jigs in automated processes, and thus do not provide the comfort of traditionally made or custom-made frames which do have noticeably slacker seat-tube angles.|$|E
500|$|The large nasal {{passages}} ensure fast flow {{of sufficient}} air, and the enlarged {{heart and lungs}} allow the enrichment of blood with oxygen in a short time. This allows cheetahs to rapidly regain their stamina after a chase. During a typical chase, their respiratory rate increases from 60 to 150 breaths per minute. While running, {{in addition to having}} good traction due to their semi-retractable claws, cheetahs use their tail as a rudder-like means of steering that enables them to make sharp turns, necessary to outflank antelopes that often change direction to escape during a chase. The protracted claws increase grip over the ground, while foot pads make the sprint more convenient over tough ground. The tight binding of the tibia and the fibula restrict rotation about the lower leg, thus stabilising the animal throughout the sprint; the downside, however, is that this reduces climbing efficiency. The pendulum-like motion of the scapula increases the stride length and assists in <b>shock</b> <b>absorption.</b> The extension of the vertebral column can add as much as [...] to the length of a stride. During {{more than half of the}} time of the sprint, the animal has all four limbs in the air; this also contributes to the stride length.|$|E

The femur connects at the acetabulum of the pelvis and projects laterally before angling medially and inferiorly to form the knee. Although this joint has three degrees of freedom, it is still stable due to the interaction of ligaments and cartilage. The labrum lines the circumference of the acetabulum to provide stability and <b>shock</b> <b>absorption.</b> Articular cartilage covers the concave area of acetabulum, providing more stability and <b>shock</b> <b>absorption.</b> [...] Surrounding the entire joint itself is a capsule secured by the tendon of the psoas muscle and three ligaments. The iliofemoral, or Y, ligament is located anteriorly and serves to prevent hip hyperextension. The pubofemoral ligament is located anteriorly just underneath the iliofemoral ligament and serves primarily to resist abduction, extension, and some external rotation. Finally the ischiofemoral ligament on the posterior side of the capsule resists extension, adduction, and internal rotation. When considering the biomechanics of hip fractures, it is important to examine the mechanical loads the hip experiences during low energy falls.|$|E

40|$|Accidents {{occur on}} {{construction}} sites {{because of the}} dynamic, complex and unpredictable nature of construction projects and operations. To enhance workplace safety, {{it is important to}} understand interrelationships among safety risks associated with construction accidents. The overarching goal of the research presented in this paper aims to explore ways to prevent safety risks and reduce the likelihood of construction accident occurrence. The study incorporates the systems theory into Heinrich’s domino theory to explore risks’ interrelationship and break the chain of accident causation. Through both empirical and statistical analyses of 9, 358 accidents which occurred in the U.

The study then discussed relationships between accidents and risks including worker behaviour, injury source, and environmental condition, and identified key risk factors and risk combinations causing accidents. The large number of accident samples supported reliable statistical analyses. The research outcomes will assist safety managers to prioritize risks according to the likelihood of accident occurrence and injury severity, and pay more attention to controlling and balancing them to prevent accidents and achieve safer working environment...|$|R
