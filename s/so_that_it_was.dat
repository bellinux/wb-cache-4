5|$|A {{powerful}} Senate Select Committee {{oversaw the}} NCDC and renowned British architect Sir William Holford {{was brought in}} to fine-tune Griffin's original plans. He changed the central basin's geometry <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> no longer a segment of circle; he converted the southern straight edge into a polygonal shape with three edges and inserted a gulf on the northern shore. The result was closer to Scrivener's modified design some decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{short period}} of abandonment, Park Hall was {{purchased}} from the council by Mike Harris with a view to redevelopment and The New Saints moving back to the ground. The New Saints started to use Park Hall as their regular home ground again in 2007 and the ground was further improved <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> able to host matches in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. It has since been used to host youth international fixtures for both England and Wales while also hosting Non-League football for community teams in Oswestry.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Senators {{unveiled}} a new logo, taking the head, {{which had been}} in profile, and rotating it <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> face-first. The new logo was unveiled with a new red 'third' jersey, prominently using 'curved' or 'swoosh' stripes. On the shoulder, the original logo {{was used as a}} shoulder patch. The original dark jersey, (then the 'away' jersey) which was mostly black, was retired after the season. The red jersey became the home jersey and it remained in use {{until the end of the}} 2007 Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E

5|$|Kelly pool {{has long}} been {{associated}} with gambling—so much <b>so,</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> made illegal in some municipalities in the US and Canada. In the state of Montana, for example, the playing of kelly pool was punishable by a $25 fine until the law was repealed in 1964. Likewise, the playing of kelly pool was banned in the Canadian province of Manitoba at least as of 1918. Gambling exploits associated with kelly pool were often depicted in Clare Briggs' comic strip of the same name, which centered on the game. The Kelly Pool strip (panel pictured at right), ran in the New York Tribune's sports section from 1912 to 1917.|$|E
5|$|The Mahans {{featured}} improvements over previous destroyers, with 12 torpedo tubes, superimposed gun shelters, and generators {{for emergency}} use. Standard displacement increased from 1,365 tons to 1,500 tons. The class {{introduced a new}} steam propulsion system that combined increases in pressure and temperature with {{a new type of}} lightweight steam turbine, proving simpler and more efficient than the Mahans' predecessors—so much <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> used on many subsequent wartime US destroyers.|$|E
5|$|The linking of the GN and B routes at Holborn {{meant that}} {{the section of the}} GN south of Holborn became a branch from the main route.

Construction of the branch was delayed while the London County Council carried out slum clearances to construct its new road Kingsway and the tramway subway running beneath it and while the UERL decided how the junction between the main route and the branch would be arranged at Holborn.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} in 1801 was 169. The 1831 census recorded {{that there were}} 51 adult males (over 20 years old) and {{that the majority of}} residents were labourers or servants, with over half the male adult workers being employed in agriculture. After reaching a high of 291 in 1821, the population declined to a low of 213 in 1871. The population rose thereafter <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> 300 in 1931.|$|E
5|$|In 1660 the {{population}} of the town (only including the urban parts of the parish) has been estimated at 1,800, which made it the 10th largest town in Devon and Cornwall. The town's population grew to 2,750 by 1750 (meaning it was the 8th largest town) but it then fell rapidly <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only 2,275 by 1805 - only the 23rd largest town in Devon and Cornwall. This fall in population, in a period when many other towns grew rapidly, was probably due to the decline in the importance of the cloth trade in this period. The population of the parish changed little {{from the start of the}} 19th century until the 1970s, remaining at around 3,000 (see chart). However it increased rapidly in the last part of the 20th century and the start of the 21st. Cullompton's population growth looks set to continue as Mid Devon's core strategy foresees 95 new dwellings being built per year in the period to 2026.|$|E

5|$|In 1868, the Scottish {{shipbuilder}} John Elder {{published an}} article that advocated that widening the beam of a ship would reduce the area {{that needed to be}} protected and allow it to carry thicker armour and heavier, more powerful guns in comparison to a normal ship. In addition such a ship would have a shallower draught and only a moderate increase in power would be required to match the speed of a normal ship. Sir Edward Reed, then Director of Naval Construction of the Royal Navy, agreed with Elder's conclusions. Rear-Admiral Andrei Alexandrovich Popov of the Imperial Russian Navy further expanded on Elder's concept by broadening the ship <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> actually circular and he made the design flat-bottomed, unlike Elder's convex hull, to minimise its draught.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{wanted the}} Doctor to realise that Rose has {{something}} to offer to his cause. Their holding hands while running was meant to signify {{that they were a}} team, despite him not asking her yet, and they were not to question their relationship. The episode was intended to be presented from Rose's point-of-view. For audience identification purposes, Davies wanted the alien menace to be easily mistaken as human, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible for Rose to mistake the aliens for humans. Davies felt that {{there was no need to}} create a new monster, as the Autons met these criteria. The Auton sequences were difficult to film because the costumes were uncomfortable for the actors; which meant that frequent breaks from filming were needed. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used in post-production to cover up the zipper on the back of the necks of the Auton costumes. Davies wanted to recreate the scene of the Autons breaking out of shop windows from their first appearance in Spearhead from Space, although he had the budget to actually smash the glass instead of just cutting around it like in Spearhead.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944, the Japanese Combined Fleet {{withdrew from}} its base at Truk in the Central Pacific to Palau and Singapore. The {{appearance}} of a powerful Japanese naval force at Singapore concerned the Allies, as it was feared that these ships could potentially conduct raids in the Indian Ocean and against Western Australia. In response, the Allies strengthened their naval and air forces in the area by transferring two British light cruisers from the Atlantic and Mediterranean {{as well as several}} U.S. Navy warships from the Pacific. The number of air units in Ceylon and the Bay of Bengal region was also increased. Admiral James Somerville, the commander of the British Eastern Fleet, feared that the Japanese would repeat their devastating Indian Ocean raid of early 1942, and on 25February requested permission to withdraw his fleet from its base at Trincomalee <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not at risk from the larger Japanese force. The Admiralty rejected this request, and directed that the fleet should remain at Trincomalee unless it was threatened by a superior Japanese force as its withdrawal would affect morale and harm Britain's prestige in the region. It was agreed, however, that the Eastern Fleet should not engage superior Japanese forces and could withdraw if Somerville judged this necessary.|$|E
