Scottish-born Robert Gair invented the pre-cut paperboard box in 1890—flat pieces manufactured in bulk that folded into boxes. Gair's invention came about {{as a result of an}} accident: as a Brooklyn printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s, he was once printing an order of seed bags, and the metal ruler, normally used to crease bags, shifted in position and cut them. Gair discovered that by cutting and creasing in one operation he could make prefabricated paperboard boxes.|$|R

40|$|The {{resemblance}} of {{lipid membrane}} models to physiological membranes determines how well molecular dynamics (MD) simulations imitate the dynamic behavior of cell membranes and membrane proteins. Physiological lipid membranes {{are composed of}} multiple types of phospholipids, and the leaflet compositions are generally asymmetric. Here we describe an approach for self-assembly of a Coarse-Grained (CG) membrane model with physiological composition and leaflet asymmetry using the MARTINI force field. An initial <b>set-up</b> of two <b>boxes</b> with different types of lipids according to the leaflet asymmetry of mammalian cell membranes stacked with 0. 5 nm overlap, reliably resulted in the self-assembly of bilayer membranes with leaflet asymmetry resembling that of physiological mammalian cell membranes. Self-assembly {{in the presence of}} a fragment of the plasma membrane protein syntaxin 1 A led to spontaneous specific positioning of phosphatidylionositol(4, 5) bisphosphate at a positively charged stretch of syntaxin consistent with experimental data. An analogous approach choosing an initial set-up with two concentric shells filled with different lipid types results in successful assembly of a spherical vesicle with asymmetric leaflet composition. Self-assembly of the vesicle in the presence of the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin 2 revealed the correct position of the synaptobrevin transmembrane domain. This is the first CG MD method to form a membrane with physiological lipid composition as well as leaflet asymmetry by self-assembly and will enable unbiased studies of the incorporation and dynamics of membrane proteins in more realistic CG membrane models...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: It {{has been}} shown that three new {{synthetic}} coumarins- 3 -carboxamides including 3 -fluorobenzilchloride, 4 -fluorobenzilchloride and 2 -hidroxy- 3 metoxybenzaldehyde, have acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. This study was performed to estimate ameliorating effect of these new coumarin- 3 -carboxamides on memory impairments induced by scopolamine (1 mg/kg, induced prolongation) in mice. Methods: 30 male mice were divided into five groups, 6 mice in each group. Three experiment groups received coumarins- 3 - carboxamides (10 mg/kg body weight) 30 min before scopalamin injection and two other groups considered as normal (saline-treated) groups and finally one negative control (scopalamin only) group. The experiment groups were treated with coumarins of 3 -fluorobenzilchloride, 4 -fluorobenzilchloride and 2 -hidroxy- 3 metoxybenzaldehyde. The passive avoidance test was performed in an automatic conventional shuttle <b>box</b> <b>set-up.</b> The stepped down latency and number of errors was recorded. Results: With reference to saline-treated group, scopolamine-treated mice demonstrated impairment of learning and memory as a reduction of latency and an increased numbers of errors in step-down test) p < 0. 01). Treated mice receiving these coumarins at the dose of 10 mg/kg showed {{an increase in the number}} of avoidances on the memory tests compared to the scopolamine group (p < 0. 01). Conclusion: The study has demonstrated some therapeutic effects of coumarin- 3 -carboxamides on learning and memory deficit induced by scopolamine. Further investigation is needed to explore whether coumarin- 3 -carboxamides could be beneficial for memory impairment in Alzheimer’s disease in which cholinergic deficit is one of the hallmarks.  ...|$|R
40|$|Bell (1991) {{argued that}} utterances are {{designed}} primarily with their audience in mind. Audience design, tailoring an utterance to accommodate an addressee’s needs, is only successful if the speaker possesses an accurate knowledge of an audience’s requirements (Traxler & Gernsbacher, 1993). Experience of a task may enhance this knowledge, building detailed representations of addressees’ perspectives. We investigated whether direct experience and experience through observation (vicarious experience) increased audience design, and {{allowed it to}} transfer more easily between tasks. Personality was addressed, investigating whether certain traits are more adept at using audience design. A referential matching paradigm was used with two tasks to assess transfer. Directors instructed their matchers to retrieve shapes from a cabinet or <b>box</b> <b>set-up</b> and place them on a grid to replicate theirs. The set-up of both tasks was such that an instruction could be helpful or unhelpful. Experience was manipulated at three levels, directors having either: taken part in a practice game (direct); watched a game on a video (vicarious); or had no previous experience of the task. Four selecting games and four checking stages, where the director read out the completed grid, were played. Ninety-six responses were recorded per director and deemed helpful or unhelpful. The IPIP (Goldberg, 1999) questionnaire collected five scores for personality traits. Two one-way ANOVAs were conducted using either the number of helpful instructions or the difference between helpful instructions in the selecting and checking tasks as a measure for audience design against level of experience. Both produced marginally significant results between no experience and direct experience. This supports the beneficial qualities of direct experience and the mean patterns were promising for the advantages of vicarious learning. Correlations of helpfulness with personality traits were significant between the box selecting task and openness. Transfer and personality results were interesting, but showed little support for the hypotheses. Limitations and further research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of {{personal protective equipment}} (PPE) and its contribution to increase personal safety in usual work places has to be proven by tests. One potential hazard for people are electric fault arcs occurring with short-circuits in electric power installations. There are very high risks for persons especially in case of direct exposure, e. g. during live working or working in the vicinity to live parts. Particularly radiation and convective heat is converted. With the box test according to IEC or EN 61482 - 1 - 2 a method for testing protection textiles and clothing against the thermal hazards of electric fault arcs has already been existing and used in certification for several years. But as shown by arc accidents the face is also particularly affected by severe damages. Protective equipment for eye and face protection which is also tested for arc resistance and protection is necessary. Based on basic investigations test principles for eye and face protection equipment against the thermal hazards of electric fault arcs have been developed and laid down in a new German test guide. The test <b>set-up</b> of the <b>box</b> test is suitable. It has been adapted and modified by a test head where test samples such as visors, visorhelmet combinations, face shields etc. are placed. The tests are carried out in accordance to the box test method of protective clothing (IEC/EN 61482 - 1 - 2). The paper gives information on tests made according to this test guide. Furthermore general conclusions are drawn on how to test and how to standardize tests of PPE for eye and face protection. The principles will be introduced in E DIN 58118 becoming a supplementation to the German edition of EN 166. It can also be the base for an international or European standard later on...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{performances}} {{represent an}} important business aspect both referred to aeronautical product than transportation means in general. Very often, numerical modeling represent {{a powerful tool}} for the prediction of expected noise level once structural characteristics and noise source specification have been defined. These model may become very complex when strong interaction of structural and acoustic elements are involved as wells as the frequency range of interest increase. In any case, the availability of different, complementary approaches as those based on FEM, BEM, SEA, Ray Tracing, among the others, let assume that appreciable results can be achieved. In this scenario, it can be stated that one of the bigger limitation of these technique is the unavailability to investigate the subjective (more that objective) response to noise exposure that in many case in considered an important parameters when comfort or annoyance aspect need to be evaluated. That is the reason why deep interest is going to be dedicated to the “acoustic virtual prototyping” intended as the auralization process of a numerical simulation, that would guarantee the opportunity to “hear” the noise more than analyses its “technical descriptors”. It is important to underline that the not-stationary peculiarities of the phenomena, require that relative implementing tools have to be very fast in the signal computation as extremely precise in the signal reconstruction to guarantee the correspondence of “virtual “ noise to real expected one. The present work will present some results related to the implementation of a specifically designed digital FIR filters that, starting from results of “standard” numerical models (FEM/BEM or others), are able to reconstruct the time related system response and to digitalize the expected noise.

40|$|A basi {{question}} in me hani s and physi s {{is how to}} bridge the gap between a mi ros opi model and a ma ros opi (ontinuum) des ription. The former involves onta t for es and deformations, whereas the latter on erns tensorial quantities like the stress or the deformation gradient. The ma ros opi balan e equations for mass, momentum and energy an be used for the ontinuum modeling of the behavior of granular media. However, in order to lose the system of equations, they rely on onstitutive relations between the physi al quantities (expressed in terms of material parameters [8, 13 ℄), sin e the mi ros opi details of a gran-ular material are not dire tly taken into a ount on the ma ro-s ale. The aim of this paper is to present a mi ro-ma ro transition from ros opi " simulations to ma ros opi on-stitutive relations for the material behavior. The model system, a two-dimensional bi-axial box lled with ohesive, fri tionless disks of dierent sizes, is examined by means of a ros opi " dis rete element method (DEM). The mi ros opi intera tion model for ohesion is tested via several stress- or strain-ontrolled bi-axial deformation paths. Using the whole box as representative elementary volume, the stress is examined as a fun tion of the applied strain, and the yield surfa e is determined from bi-axial ompression tests. Other measured ma ros opi parameters are the Young modulus, the Poisson ratio, the dilatan y angle, the fri tion angle, and the ohesion. 1. 2 Model System One possibility to obtain information about the material behavior is to perform elemen-tary tests in the laboratory. An alternative are simulations with the dis rete element model (DEM) [13, 9, 10, 12, 14 ℄ and the average over the ros opi " quantities in some averaging volume.
