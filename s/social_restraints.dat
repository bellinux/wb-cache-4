The band was composed of white men--that class of white men who, throwing off all moral and <b>social</b> <b>restraints,</b> give themselves up to the practice of every species of iniquity, fearing neither God nor man. They were, in short, a band of robbers and cut-throats, whose special business at that time was hunting buffalo, but who were not averse to sell their services to any nation that chanced to be at war, or to practice simple robbery when opportunity offered.|$|E
60|$|Only noting, as we pass, {{that this}} is one of those anticipations which bring about their own fulfilment--that it is because most who {{disapprove}} these conventions do not show their disapproval, that the few who do show it look eccentric--and that did all act out their convictions, no such inference as the above would be drawn, and no such evil would result;--noting this as we pass, we go on to reply that these <b>social</b> <b>restraints,</b> and forms, and requirements, are not small evils, but among the greatest. Estimate their sum total, and we doubt whether they would not exceed most others. Could we add up the trouble, the cost, the jealousies, vexations, misunderstandings, the loss of time and the loss of pleasure, which these conventions entail--could we clearly realise the extent to which we are all daily hampered by them, daily enslaved by them; we should perhaps come to the conclusion that the tyranny of Mrs. Grundy is worse than any other tyranny we suffer under. Let us look at a few of its hurtful results; beginning with those of minor importance.|$|E
60|$|Thus far, the {{benefits}} {{which it has}} appeared {{that the world would}} gain by ceasing to make sex a disqualification for privileges and a badge of subjection, are social rather than individual; consisting in an increase of the general fund of thinking and acting power, and an improvement in the general conditions of the association of men with women. But it would be a grievous understatement of the case to omit the most direct benefit of all, the unspeakable gain in private happiness to the liberated half of the species; the difference to them between a life of subjection to the will of others, and a life of rational freedom. After the primary necessities of food and raiment, freedom is the first and strongest want of human nature. While mankind are lawless, their desire is for lawless freedom. When they have learnt to understand the meaning of duty and the value of reason, they incline more and more to be guided and restrained by these in the exercise of their freedom; but they do not therefore desire freedom less; they do not become disposed to accept the will of other people as the representative and interpreter of those guiding principles. On the contrary, the communities in which the reason has been most cultivated, and in which the idea of social duty has been most powerful, are those which have most strongly asserted the freedom of action of the individual--the liberty of each to govern his conduct by his own feelings of duty, and by such laws and <b>social</b> <b>restraints</b> as his own conscience can subscribe to.|$|E

50|$|Behavioral contagion, largely {{discussed}} in the behaviors of crowds, and closely related to emotional contagion, plays {{a large role in}} gatherings of two or more people. In the original Milgram experiment on obedience, for example, where participants, who were in a room with only the experimenter, were ordered to administer increasingly more severe electrical shocks as punishment to a person in another room (from here on out, referred to as the “victim”), the conflict or <b>social</b> <b>restraint</b> experienced by the participants was the obligation to not disobey the experimenter - even when shocking the victim to the highest shock level given, a behavior which the participants saw as opposing their personal and social ideals (Milgram, 1965, p. 129).|$|R

40|$|A new {{dimension}} may {{be added to}} the study and teaching of a second language by the development of contrastive sociolinguistics. Sociolinguistics is defined here as the study of how a person relates to another person in terms of language, and is concerned with relational utterances rather than factual statements. Relational utterances are those that assume the existence of a listener, to whom the speaker is relating himself. Such utterances vary in tone and style, depending on the variables of sex, age, status, and familiarity. These variables make it socially, not linguistically, obligatory for certain relational utterances to be selected over others. The necessity of teaching the differences in relational utterances is illustrated {{in the case of the}} Japanese, who cannot confortably use English imperatives or invectives because of the <b>social</b> <b>restraint</b> on such usage in Japanese. In additio / to the contrastive difficulties between languages, factual statements and relational utterances vary grammatically within one language.

40|$|The most {{accepted}} {{animal model}} for simulation of the physiological and morphological consequences of microgravity on the cardiovascular system {{is one of}} head-down hindlimb unloading. Experimental conditions surrounding this model include not only head-down tilting of rats, but also <b>social</b> and <b>restraint</b> stresses that have their own influences on cardiovascular system function. Here, we studied levels of spontaneous locomotor activity, blood pressure, and heart rate during 14 days under the following experimental conditions: cage control, social isolation in standard rat housing, social isolation in special cages for hindlimb unloading, horizontal attachment (restraint), and head-down hindlimb unloading. General activity and hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored in conscious rats by telemetry. Heart rate and blood pressure were both evaluated during treadmill running to reveal cardiovascular deconditioning development {{as a result of}} unloading. The main findings of our work are that: <b>social</b> isolation and <b>restraint</b> induced persistent physical inactivity, while unloading in rats resulted in initial inactivity followed by normalization and increased locomotion after one week. Moreover, 14 days of hindlimb unloading showed significant elevation of blood pressure and slight elevation of heart rate. Hemodynamic changes in isolated and restrained rats largely reproduced the trends observed during unloading. Finally, we detected no augmentation of tachycardia during moderate exercise in rats after 14 days of unloading. Thus, we concluded that both <b>social</b> isolation and <b>restraint,</b> {{as an integral part of}} the model conditions, contribute essentially to cardiovascular reactions during head-down hindlimb unloading, compared to the little changes in the hydrostatic gradient...|$|R

5000|$|David Seed [...] wrote: [...] "An {{altogether}} more {{ambiguous and}} less high-minded {{view of human}} response provided by novels like Alfred Coppel's [...] "Dark December". They show a single character making his way across a shattered landscape presenting obvious physical dangers to his survival, but the prime danger presented to this man comes from another army officer who uses the necessities of the post-war situation to justify the most savage acts. Again and again nuclear war is shown as stripping away the superego of the survivors. And if <b>social</b> <b>restraints</b> are lost, {{does this mean that}} the war allows free play to bloodlust and other impulses held in check? Not quite, since the rupture between pre-war and post-war is never total. In Coppel's novel the protagonist has been serving in an underground bunker when the nuclear attack happened, and so the action of Dark December, as well as describing encounters with physical dangers, becomes an extended psychological drama between Gavin's old self and his dark double personified in the crazy Major Collingwood who shadows him everywhere. Collingwood's eventual death therefore symbolises the survival of pre-war civilization, albeit in a tenuous way".|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} recent {{phenomenon}} of premarital stag party tours made to Eastern European cities by groups of British men. It {{is based on}} ethnographic field research in Krakow, Poland, conducted {{over the course of}} one year. The use of qualitative methods, primarily participant-observation, allows for the exploration of the in situ meanings and social interactions which define the stag weekend. The thesis argues that the behaviour of stag tour groups offers considerable insight into masculinity and that the meanings attributed to such behaviour reveal complex construction of contemporary British masculinities. It is argued that the Eastern European stag tour is both sold and consumed on the premise that it represents a distinct physical, social and symbolic space and time within which masculine behaviour can be enacted. This is seen as a liminal space within which an exaggerated hyper-masculinity based on a carnivalesque social transgression becomes possible and desired. It is argued that the stag tour is both performative and embodied. The male body plays a central role through the consumption of alcohol, its effects upon the body and the use of bodies by stag tourists to foster an ethos of playfulness and enact a transgressive release from <b>social</b> <b>restraint.</b> Intimacy, sociability and group cohesion {{play a significant role in}} shaping the meaning of the stag weekend for tour participants. The thesis concludes that the stag tour represents a meaningful and symbolic moment for its participants, which is mediated by notions of masculinity and homosociality. While the stag tour represents a manifestation of hegemonic masculinity in a narrow sense, it also highlights the adaptability, rather than „crisis‟, of masculinity for the men involved.
