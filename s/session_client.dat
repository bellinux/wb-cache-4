40|$|Existing {{tools for}} {{evaluating}} psychosocial interventions (un-validated self-reporting questionnaires) are not {{ideal for use}} in non-Western conflict settings. We implement a generic method of treatment evaluation, using client and counsellor feedback, in 18 projects in non-Western humanitarian settings. We discuss our findings {{from the perspective of}} validity and suggestions for future research. A retrospective analysis is executed using data gathered from psychosocial projects. Clients (n = 7, 058) complete two (complaints and functioning) rating scales each session and counsellors rate the client's status at exit. The client-completed pre- and post-intervention rating scales show substantial changes. Counsellor evaluation of the clients' status shows a similar trend in improvement. All three multivariable models for each separate scale have similar associations between the scales and the investigated variables despite different cultural settings. The validity is good. Limitations are: ratings give only a general impression and clinical risk factors are not measured. Potential ceiling effects may influence change of scales. The intra and inter-rater reliability of the counsellors' rating is not assessed. The focus on client and counsellor perspectives to evaluate treatment outcome seems a strong alternative for evaluation instruments frequently used in psychosocial programming. The <b>session</b> <b>client</b> rated scales helps client and counsellor to set mutual treatment objectives and reduce drop-out risk. Further research should test the scales against a cross-cultural valid gold standard to obtain insight into their clinical relevance...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{sequential}} explanatory mixed methods {{study was to investigate}} the process of mandatory counseling and factors that are pivotal in this process. Specifically, the goal of this research project was to assess how the working alliance (WA) changes at the early stage of mandatory counseling and to explain why this change occurs, based on: (a) client hope and motivation for treatment; and (b) qualitative interviews with selected clients. ^ In the first, quantitative phase of the study, data were collected via administration of self-report questionnaires (i. e., WAI, Hope Scale, and Motivation for Treatment Scale) to sixty-three correctional center inmates who were mandated for counseling. Preliminary quantitative analysis revealed the presence of a significant therapist effect at all points of the data collection as well as in all variables under investigation. Latent growth curve modeling analysis (LG) was conducted on the quantitative data. The growth model for WA slope was non-significant. Participants’ WA trajectories were categorized into six different groups: accelerating linear, decelerating linear, relatively stable, accelerating quadratic dramatic, accelerating quadratic late onset, decelerating quadratic, and constant. Surprisingly, on average, mandated clients’ WA ratings were high when compared with voluntary clients’ WA ratings in other studies. The LG analysis of the data also revealed the presence of significant variance in the WA ratings after the first counseling <b>session.</b> <b>Client</b> hope and motivation for treatment were found to be non-significant covariates. ^ In the second, qualitative phase, six participants, one from each group of change in the WA, were interviewed. The participants’ responses regarding their therapy experience were grouped into six themes: (1) therapy development, (2) client role, (3) therapist role, (4) client-therapist relationship, (5) therapy process, and (6) therapy outcomes. Overall, three groups of factors were found to be important in the WA development process: client, therapist, and process factors. The qualitative analysis of interviews found that therapist factors are most influential in WA formation in the area of mandated counseling. Based on the findings from both phases of the study, implications and suggestions for practice of mandatory counseling and research are also discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which managed care behavioral controls are associated with treatment intensity in outpatient substance abuse treatment facilities. Data are from the 1995 National Drug Abuse Treatment System Survey, a nationally representative survey that includes over 600 provider organizations with a response rate of 86 %. Treatment intensity is measured in three ways: (1) the number of months clients spend in outpatient drug treatment, (2) the number of individual treatment <b>sessions</b> <b>clients</b> receive over the course of treatment, and (3) the number of group treatment <b>sessions</b> <b>clients</b> receive over the course of treatment. After accounting for selection bias and controlling for market, organization, and client characteristics, there is no significant relationship between the scope of managed care oversight and treatment intensity. However, the stringency of managed care oversight activities is negatively associated with the number of individual and group treatment sessions received over the course of treatment...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} relationship between client emotional expression and the level of working alliance between therapist and client. The data were collected from 24 psychotherapy sessions conducted by exemplary psychotherapists of different theoretical orientations. The results of the quantitative analysis indicated that there was no significant linear relationship between the level of intensity of client emotional expression and the level of working alliance. Client emotional expression occurred independently of the level of the working alliance. Using a qualitative method, the study restricted its sample to 5 episodes each from the high and low working alliance sessions in order to examine therapeutic processes surrounding client emotional expression more closely. It was found that the nature of emotional expression and the interaction between therapist and client were quite different in episodes taken from the high and the low alliance sessions. In the high alliance <b>sessions,</b> <b>clients</b> expressed their troubling feelings as they examined their problems. Client emotional expressions were signs of productive therapeutic process. On the other hand, in the low alliance <b>sessions,</b> <b>clients</b> expressed anger and frustration toward their therapists for certain breaches of their relationship. Independently of the differing theoretical orientations, the therapeutic process appeared to converge particularly in the low alliance sessions, showing a similar pattern of therapist and client transactions. In addition to the findings, the study proposed a qualitative method suited for examining a wide variety of questions arising from clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|Solution Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT) {{is a goal}} {{oriented}} therapeutic {{approach that}} assists clients to build solutions rather than analyse problems. Solution focused (SF) therapists often open sessions, subsequent to the first, with the question ‘What is better since we last met?’ {{with the purpose of}} enabling clients to gain a heightened sense of their own self efficacy. This research explores how clients and a solution focused therapist co-construct new meanings when having conversations about ‘What’s better?’ The study approaches this question from an interpretative perspective. Five clients agreed {{to be part of the}} research while engaging in solution-focused counselling. Each client met with the counsellor on up to five occasions during which time the ‘What’s better?’ question was asked. Following each <b>session</b> <b>clients</b> were asked to provide their perceptions on the <b>session</b> on <b>client</b> feedback forms. Excerpts transcribed from single <b>sessions</b> with different <b>clients</b> were microanalysed to determine how the co-construction process occurs. The analysis revealed the collaborative and co-constructive character of Solution Focused Therapy conversations. The ‘What’s better?’ prompt led to a shift in meaning for clients. Comments made on the client feedback forms showed that the conversations raised greater awareness of their own achievements, competencies and positive aspects in their lives. Clients also expressed an increase in hope through conversations about ‘What’s better?’ The findings of this study build on research that suggests therapists’ discursive tools such as ‘questions’, ‘formulations’, ‘lexical choice’, and ‘grounding’ provide the means to influence therapeutic conversations. Analysis of dialogues in this study show that purposefully applied ‘compliments’, which do not fit into any previously identified discursive tools, can be useful for co-constructing new meanings. This study also extends previous research by demonstrating that both the choice of discursive tool and the purpose of its application are influential in therapeutic conversations...|$|R

Study 1 was the discovery-oriented phase of task analysis, which intensively examined 6 examples of global distress. The qualitative findings produced a model showing: global distress, fear, shame, and aggressive anger as undifferentiated and insufficiently processed emotions; the articulation of needs and negative self-evaluations as a pivotal step in change; and assertive anger, self-soothing, hurt, and grief as states of advanced processing. Study 2 tested the model using a sample of 34 clients in global distress. A multivariate analysis of variance showed that the model of emotional processing predicted positive in-session effects, and bootstrapping analyses were used to demonstrate that distinct emotions emerged moment by moment in predicted sequential patterns...|$|R
