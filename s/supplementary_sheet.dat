40|$|The {{project is}} a {{laboratory}} training experience for volunteer church school teachers in the Protestant church. It supports the philosophy and approach of {{the objective of the}} church's educational ministry as adopted by the Church of God, Anderson, Indiana. In the lab persons identify their own teaching style, compare it with that of others, and explore any modifications they might wish to make in their own approach to teaching-learning. They do this by evaluating objectives in the cognitive and affective domains, writing instructional. objectives, developing a criteria for effective teaching in 13 dimensions of classroom activity, and observing and rating classroom teaching activities. The materials used in the lab are a leader's guide, student-Is workbook, reading book, cassette tape on cognitive/affective objectives, two films, and a simulation game on writing objectives and planning for teaching. Kit contains 1 cassette with script, 1 leader's guide, 1 reading book, 1 simulation game, 4 <b>supplementary</b> <b>sheets</b> with 1 leaflet, and workbook with support material. Thesis (M.

25|$|In November 2003, the Supreme Court of India put a {{stay on the}} trial. In 2004, the POTA was {{repealed}} {{after the}} United Progressive Alliance (UPA) came to power, prompting it to review the invocation of the POTA against the accused. In May 2005, the POTA review commission decided not to charge the accused under POTA. This was later unsuccessfully challenged by a relative of the victim before the Gujarat High Court and later on appeal before Supreme Court. In September 2008, the Nanavati Commission submitted its report on the incident. In 2009, after accepting {{the report of the}} Special Investigation Team (SIT) appointed by it, the court appointed a special fast-track court to try the case along with 5 other fast track courts established to try the post-incident riots. The bench hearing the case also said that public prosecutors should be appointed in consultation with the SIT chairman. It ordered that the SIT would be the nodal agency for deciding about witness protection and also asked that it file <b>supplementary</b> charge <b>sheets</b> and that it may cancel the bail of the accused. More than 100 people were arrested in relation to the incident. The court was set up inside the Sabarmati Central Jail, where almost all of the accused were confined. The hearing began in May 2009. Additional Sessions Judge P R Patel was designated to hear the case.|$|R

40|$|The British Geological Survey (BGS) {{has been}} {{commissioned}} by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to give guidance on what are normal levels of contaminants in English soils {{in support of the}} Part 2 A Contaminated Land Statutory Guidance. This has initially been done by studying the distribution of four contaminants – arsenic (As), lead (Pb), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and asbestos – in topsoils from England. The work was extended further to include cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and mercury (Hg) enabling methodologies developed by the project to be tested on a larger range of contaminants. This report serves to record the information collected on the additional four contaminants (Cd, Cu, Ni and Hg) that was undertaken in order to define their Normal Background Concentrations (NBCs). Other earlier Project reports should be consulted for the full background to methods used to analyse these data, in particular Work package 1 & 2, and Work package 3 reports. The Technical Guidance Sheets, and Technical Guidance <b>Sheet</b> <b>Supplementary</b> Information for each of these additional contaminants provide the final synthesis of this exploratory data analysis, and should be considered as the definitive resource for the Normal Background Concentrations...|$|R
40|$|As {{the dairy}} {{industry}} becomes more customer-focused dairy farmers are being encouraged {{to adopt a}} formal approach to quality management. At the same time milk processing companies are examining the procedures used to ensure milk collected from farms is of the "finest" standard {{as part of their}} strategy to move from commodity sales to added-value products. In addition, milk quality and milk payment parameters have changed over the last decade to reflect the more valuable components of milk (protein versus fat), the pattern of production through the year (shoulder milk premiums) and the absence of quality faults (grades). Animal welfare and resource management are also important quality 'factors' in the dairy industry. As New Zealand seeks to enhance its "clean green" image, farmers are coming under the scrutiny of quality conscious customers seeking to ensure that the highest standards of animal husbandry, land management and food production are practiced. Parameters for milk quality at the vat (farm-gate) are well documented and strict testing procedures are in place at milk processing sites. However, procedures and practices necessary to consistently produce finest quality milk are not so obvious. To address this shortcoming a study was conducted to design and implement a Total Quality Management (TQM) programme at Massey University's No. 4 dairy farm, a 450 cow seasonal supply dairy farm. A monthly management calendar was developed to aid in consistently achieving key farm management activities. A <b>supplementary</b> monthly diary <b>sheet</b> was also designed to allow comprehensive recording of farm and herd data that are pertinent to the assurance of product quality. Computer software was utilised to model, record and monitor farm physical and financial performance. The key attribute of the TQM programme was to ensure that staff were willing and able to implement the management systems put in place for assuring quality milk production. This required staff training and development, and recognition for tasks completed well. The implementation of a TQM programme can lead to measurable rewards in improved physical and financial performance. The programme also ensures compliance with the legislation governing animal welfare, resource management, employment and occupational safety and health. Job satisfaction for staff and assured milk quality are seen as a key benefits...|$|R
