5|$|At {{the start}} of the 17th century, {{possibly}} around 1600, a new hall was built in stone to replace the older timber-framed one; it was positioned to the south, replacing the earlier 15th-century extension. The new hall was slightly anachronistic, having only one floor, unlike most new halls from this period which had two storeys. The old hall was then probably adapted for use as a <b>service</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a pre-study of five <b>service</b> <b>areas</b> characterized by heterogeneous network services. The purposes of the report are to offer foundations for deeper analysis of three selected <b>service</b> <b>areas</b> and to suggest an analytical framework for studying these <b>service</b> <b>areas</b> empirically. The results show that the <b>service</b> <b>areas</b> mobile VoIP, multi play and M 2 M communication services are particularly challenged by problems and opportunities from heterogeneity and interoperability, and that this is likely to affect providers’ business model designs. The report suggests applying a structure- conduct-performance framework for investigating these challenges empirically...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the relationship between the administrative district and the zoning of the facility and <b>service</b> <b>areas.</b> First of all we divide the administrative district into seven types, then we make it clear how many correspondences between the administrative district and 34 facility and <b>service</b> <b>areas</b> by comparing each other. And after making it clear, we take notice of the historical transition of the administrative district, analyze how the administrative district is concerned with the facility and <b>service</b> <b>areas.</b> As a result, we can see that the administrative district (divided into seven types in this study, particularly, city-county area) corresponds with a lot of facility and <b>service</b> <b>areas.</b> That is, we could understand that the administrative district is concerned with the facility and <b>service</b> <b>areas</b> so much, one of the reason for that is the influence of historical transition on the administrative district(including the type of the region crossing the city-county area). After this, it is necessary we analyze the zoning of the facility and <b>service</b> <b>areas</b> with a present view as well as an overall historical view...|$|R

5|$|The freeway takes a brief jog to the {{northeast}} before crossing over a Burlington Northern Santa Fe rail line southeast of Riverdale. In the median at mile 26 is the Belle Plaine <b>Service</b> <b>Area.</b> North of the service plaza, the highway bridges the Ninnescah River and then K-55. No interchange is present to allow turnpike travelers to connect to the K-55.|$|E
5|$|The turnpike {{continues}} east along I-70 {{and crosses}} Tecumseh Creek. The Topeka <b>Service</b> <b>Area</b> {{is located on}} the north side of the road east of here at mile 188. It is accessed by ramps on the right side of the highway in both directions. Just east of the <b>service</b> <b>area,</b> the turnpike enters Douglas County while passing over US-40 without an interchange. The route then curves to the southeast and runs roughly parallel to US-40. A series of curves takes the turnpike farther east as it reaches Exit 197 (Lecompton), a folded diamond interchange with the western terminus of K-10. After this, the highway continues farther east and enters the city of Lawrence, where it shares a diamond interchange with McDonald Drive at Exit 202 (West Lawrence). McDonald Drive leads to US-59 south of the turnpike. East of here, the highway bends east-northeasterly, crosses the Kansas River, and then intersects US-40 and US-59, which run concurrently, at Exit 204 (East Lawrence).|$|E

5|$|Each {{city and}} county in the Metro <b>service</b> <b>area</b> has similar {{ordinances}} that regulate or prohibit vending on Metro-owned property, and which prohibit riders from eating, drinking, or smoking in Metro trains, buses, and stations; the Transit Police {{have a reputation for}} enforcing these laws rigorously. One widely publicized incident occurred in October 2000 when police arrested 12-year-old Ansche Hedgepeth for eating french fries in the Tenleytown-AU station. In a 2004 opinion by John Roberts, now Chief Justice of the United States, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Hedgepeth's arrest. By then WMATA had answered negative publicity by adopting a policy of first issuing warnings to juveniles, and arresting them only after three violations within a year.|$|E
