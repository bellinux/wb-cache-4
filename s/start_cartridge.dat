50|$|The Bell Aerosystems Company XLR81 (Model 8096) was an American liquid-propellant rocket engine, {{which was}} used on the Agena upper stage. It burned UDMH and RFNA fed by a {{turbopump}} in a fuel rich gas generator cycle. The turbopump had a single turbine with a gearbox to transmit power to the oxidizer and fuel pumps. The thrust chamber was all-aluminum, and regeneratively cooled by oxidizer flowing through gun-drilled passages in the combustion chamber and throat walls. The nozzle was a titanium radiatively cooled extension. The engine was mounted on an hydraulic actuated gimbal which enabled it thrust vectoring to control pitch and yaw. Engine thrust and mixture ratio were controlled by cavitating flow venturis on the gas generator flow circuit. Engine start was achieved by solid propellant <b>start</b> <b>cartridge.</b>|$|E
50|$|Engine <b>starting</b> was by <b>cartridge,</b> however, {{forced air}} restart was {{achieved}} in flight. One engine could {{be shut down}} in flight to conserve fuel.|$|R
5000|$|The {{manufacturing}} of weaponry in Ethiopia {{was started}} in the 18th century during the era of Emperor Tewodros. Historical records show Emperor Tewodros built a huge cannon called Sebastopol in 1868, in Gondar Province at a village named Gafat, {{and took it to}} the mountain of Maqdala. Later, under the reign of Emperor Menelik, an ammunition factory was established in 1911, which <b>started</b> producing <b>cartridges</b> for Wejigra and Wechefor rifles.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is based}} upon Smith & Wesson's earlier [...]38 Special {{cartridge}}. The [...]357 Magnum cartridge was introduced in 1934, and its use has since become widespread. This <b>cartridge</b> <b>started</b> the [...] "Magnum era" [...] of handgun ammunition.|$|R
50|$|The <b>cartridge</b> <b>starts</b> in EDIT mode. The {{programmer}} enters {{lines of}} assembly source into the Atari BASIC-like editor. Source text must be prefixed {{with a line}} number, or it is interpreted as a command. Errors are reported with numeric error codes.|$|R
2500|$|After White's patent {{expired in}} April 1869, a 3rd {{extension}} was refused. Other gun-makers were then allowed to {{produce their own}} weapons using the rear-loading method, without having to pay a royalty on each gun sold. Early guns were often conversions of earlier cap-and-ball revolvers, modified to accept metallic cartridges loaded from the rear, but later models, such as the Colt Model 1872 [...] "Open Top" [...] and the Smith & Wesson Model 3, were designed from the <b>start</b> as <b>cartridge</b> revolvers.|$|R
5000|$|Bell Model 8247: USAF {{designation}} XLR81-BA-13. Used on the Agena target {{vehicle and}} as a pure upper stage {{in the form of}} the Ascent Agena. It added a new system that allowed multiple restarts. The system replaced the <b>start</b> up <b>cartridges</b> for two metallic bellows on the oxidizer and fuel tank, which could supply enough pressure for start up. Once the turbopump reached its peak power, the outlet pressure was used to refill those bellows, and thus it recharged itself. While it was rated at 15 restarts, in practice it never did more than 8, which were performed during the Gemini XI mission.|$|R
50|$|As {{time went}} on, these issues were {{compounded}} as later <b>cartridges</b> <b>started</b> using cheaper, lower quality materials, such as plastic pinch rollers. Another contributing factor {{was an effort}} by record companies {{to reduce the number}} of formats offered. In the late 1970s, when sales of eight-tracks slipped, they were quick to abandon the format.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>cartridges</b> <b>started</b> out as {{custom-made}} (non-commercially developed) wildcats, {{and gained}} wide enough acceptance or popularity to become commercial cartridges. Generally, cartridges become popular commercially after a commercial firearms maker begins offering a weapon chambered in the cartridge. Once popular enough, funding is generated for SAAMI standards development. After SAAMI standards are in place, any firearms or ammunition maker {{can be sure}} that any products manufactured to the SAAMI standards can be safely used.|$|R
25|$|In addition, {{hydraulically-operated}} triangular {{air brakes}} were {{installed on the}} rear fuselage, which worked in addition with the existing 'finger'-type brakes installed in the wings; the new brakes gave the pilots a greater level of controllability, improving the accuracy of low-level bombing runs. The B-57B was equipped with an APW-11 Bombing Air Radar Guidance System for target approach guidance, {{as well as a}} APS-54 radar warning receiver. The engines were also furnished with a new <b>cartridge</b> <b>starting</b> system, eliminating the reliance on ground start carts.|$|R
50|$|Grado Labs {{was founded}} in 1953, by master watchmaker Joseph Grado. The origins of the audio company {{date back to the}} early 1950s, when Joseph left Tiffany & Company and Sherman Fairchild to <b>start</b> {{crafting}} phono <b>cartridges</b> at his kitchen table in Brooklyn, NY. After seeing a market for cartridges, he went around the corner and closed the existing Grado fruit shop, opening up Grado Laboratories. Joseph went on to invent the first stereo moving coil phono cartridge while building up Grado's cartridge lineup.|$|R

50|$|A <b>{{cartridge}}</b> <b>starting</b> {{system is}} also fitted to the tractor. A shot-gun type blank cartridge is loaded into a breech on the engine's intake system. The smouldering paper {{is placed in}} the cylinder head, and the cartridge is fired by tapping the base of the protruding firing pin with a hammer. This puts a charge into the bore, sending the piston through its stroke, bursting into life. This method, however, deposits carbon which often causes jamming of the decompression valve if cartridges are regularly used. It also puts significantly more strain on the engine.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1930s the Finnish Army <b>started</b> loading {{military}} <b>cartridges</b> with domestically produced 7.87 mm (.310 in) diameter D166 bullets as {{the production of}} new M39 [...] "Ukko-Pekka" [...] rifles barreled for 7.62×54R diameter bullets started. This change was {{due in part to}} allow the use of captured Soviet ammunition and machine gun ammunition which often was of a slightly greater bore diameter than its Finnish counterparts. The rifling twist rate was also changed from 300 mm (1 in 11.81 in) to 254 mm (1 in 10 in).|$|R
5000|$|The Mamba was {{a compact}} engine [...] with a 10-stage axial compressor, six {{combustion}} chambers and a two-stage power turbine. The epicyclic reduction gearbox was {{incorporated in the}} propeller spinner. Engine <b>starting</b> was by <b>cartridge.</b> The Ministry of Supply designation was ASM (Armstrong Siddeley Mamba). The ASM.3 gave 1,475 ehp and the ASM.6 was rated at 1,770 ehp. A 500-hour test was undertaken in 1948 and the Mamba was the first turboprop engine to power the Douglas DC-3, when in 1949, a Dakota testbed was converted to take two Mambas.|$|R
5000|$|Advance {{cartridges}} (Also {{known as}} class D) are {{half the size}} of all earlier cartridges and are compatible with Game Boy Advance and later systems including the Nintendo DS. Some cartridges are colored to resemble the game (usually for the Pokémon series; Pokémon Emerald, for example, being a clear emerald green). They are also compatible with Nintendo DS and DS Lite (but see the Reception section for limitations). Some Advance cartridges have built-in features, including rumble features (Drill Dozer), tilt sensors (WarioWare: Twisted!, Yoshi's Universal Gravitation) and solar sensors (Boktai). The product ID of games on advance <b>cartridges</b> <b>starts</b> with [...] "AGB".|$|R
5000|$|Xonox, {{based in}} Minnesota, <b>started</b> {{developing}} Atari <b>cartridges</b> {{during the height}} of the 2600's popularity. Xonox capitalized on the novelty and perceived value of [...] "double-ender" [...] cartridges. These could be inserted into the console on one of the two ends, each end offering a different game. Different double-ender configurations could package the same game with different counterparts. Xonox was not the first company to try this; Playaround did it earlier with their adult-themed titles. Xonox eventually abandoned this idea and began releasing single versions of some of the titles previously offered as double-enders as well as a few new titles.|$|R
50|$|The V.Smile {{range of}} {{consoles}} are apparently not region-locked. While the console itself come in NTSC and PAL versions and the BIOS on the consoles {{appear to be}} region specific (distinguishable from the speech sample played in the screen after the VTech logo when the console is <b>started</b> with no <b>cartridge</b> inserted), games purchased from an NTSC region can play on PAL systems and vice versa. Observations suggest that both the V.Smile and V.Smile Infant Development System used different methods of booting: The V.Smile and V.Smile Pocket variants will apparently boot into their own BIOS, then obligingly run the software on the cartridge. The V.Smile Baby appears to boot from the default BIOS when a cartridge of the same region is inserted or when there's no cartridge in the system, but appears to boot from a different BIOS when a cartridge of a different region is inserted. Currently it is unknown if the extra BIOS resides on the cartridge or on the console itself.|$|R
50|$|The Schurter Group {{was founded}} in Lucerne in 1933 by Heinrich Schurter with funding from his mother and mother-in-law, {{during the time of}} the Great Depression. The company got its <b>start</b> {{producing}} fuse <b>cartridges,</b> screw heads and set screws. Heinrich's son Rolf joined the company in the 1940s to help manage the accounting and bookkeeping. Fuseholders were added to the product line in 1944, and the company's first catalog was printed. During the 1940s Schurter products began to be listed in reseller's catalogs. The company moved to its current facilities established at Werkhofstrasse 8 in 1948. The company was transformed into a limited liability company in 1949. In 1964 the company had grown to 194 employees. By 1968, component sales amounted to two-thirds of Schurter's business due to increasing exports. Hienrich Schurter died that year. Schurter GmbH was established in Endingen, Germany in 1971 under Managing Director Kaspar Egli, who came from Lucerne to run the business.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{commonly}} produced buckshot shell is a 12 gauge, 00 buck shell that holds 9 pellets. Buckshot is generally used for two purposes: self-defense and hunting medium to large game. Loads can be tailored through altering {{the size of}} the shot, pellet count, length of the shell, powder charge, and in other ways to fit individual weapons and purposes. For instance, loads of 12 gauge 00 buck are commonly available in 8 to 18 pellets in vendor-stated lengths from 2 3/4" [...] to 3 1/2". On packaging, vendors state the length of the cartridge as expanded after firing. Before firing, the crimped <b>cartridge</b> <b>starts</b> off approximately one half inch shorter. Also, precise length varies depending on manufacturer and model. Reduced-recoil shells are becoming increasingly available. Low-recoil 00 buckshot allows the shooter to make fast follow-up shots, which may be needed in a combat situation. They are also useful for training shooters who are not yet used to the recoil of full-power shells.|$|R
50|$|In 1919, {{two years}} after Finland {{declared}} independence from the Russian Empire, the Suojeluskuntain Yliesikunnan Asepaja (Civil Guard Supreme Staff Gun Works) opened in a former Helsinki brewery to repair private arms and recondition Russian military rifles for Finnish service. The rifle repair shop became financially independent of the civil guard in 1921. The Suojeluskuntain Yliesikunnan Asepaja moved from Helsinki to an ammunition factory in Riihimäki on 1 June 1927 and reorganized as SAKO in the 1930s. Sako <b>started</b> exporting pistol <b>cartridges</b> to Sweden in the 1930s and continued manufacturing submachine gun cartridges through World War II. The firearms manufacturer Tikkakoski, which owned the Tikka brand, was merged into SAKO in 1983. The Valtion Kivääritehdas (VKT) opened at Tourula, Jyväskylä in 1925 had {{become a part of}} Valmet in the 1950s and in 1987, the state-owned Valmet and SAKO fused into SAKO-VALMET, with ownership split evenly between Nokia and Valmet. After several organizational shifts in state ownership, the SAKO name remained for the privately owned gun- and cartridge-producing company located in the cities of Riihimäki and Jyväskylä (former Valmet factory in Tourula, which was later closed). The company now is owned by Beretta Holdings.|$|R
5000|$|The 8×50mmR Lebel (8mm Lebel) (designated as the 8 × 51 R Lebel by the C.I.P.) rifle {{cartridge}} {{was the first}} smokeless powder cartridge to be made and adopted by any country. It was introduced by France in 1886. Formed by necking down the 11mm Gras black powder cartridge, the smokeless 8 mm Lebel <b>cartridge</b> <b>started</b> a revolution in military rifle ammunition. Standard 8mm Lebel military ammunition {{was also the first}} rifle ammunition to feature a spitzer boat tail bullet (Balle D), which was adopted in 1898. The long-range ballistic performance of the 8mm Lebel bullet itself was exceptional. For use in the magazine tube-fed early Lebel rifle, the 8mm case was designed to protect against accidental percussion inside the tube magazine by a circular groove around the primer cup which caught the tip of the following pointed bullet. However, the shape of its rimmed bottle-necked case, having been designed for the Lebel rifle's tube magazine, also precluded truly efficient vertical stacking inside a vertical magazine. The bolt thrust of the 8mm Lebel is relatively high compared to many other service rounds used in the early 20th century. Although it was once revolutionary, the 8mm Lebel was declared obsolete after World War I and was soon after replaced with the 7.5×54mm French round.|$|R
50|$|The Anglo-American Explosives Company began {{manufacturing}} its shotgun {{powder in}} Oakland, New Jersey in 1890. DuPont began producing guncotton at Carneys Point Township, New Jersey in 1891. Charles E. Munroe of the Naval Torpedo Station in Newport, Rhode Island patented a formulation of guncotton colloided with nitrobenzene, called Indurite, in 1891. Several United States firms began producing smokeless powder when Winchester Repeating Arms Company <b>started</b> loading sporting <b>cartridges</b> with Explosives Company powder in 1893. California Powder Works began producing {{a mixture of}} nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose with ammonium picrate as Peyton Powder, Leonard Smokeless Powder Company began producing nitroglycerine-nitrocellulose Ruby powders, Laflin & Rand negotiated a license to produce Ballistite, and DuPont started producing smokeless shotgun powder. The United States Army evaluated 25 varieties of smokeless powder and selected Ruby and Peyton Powders as the most suitable {{for use in the}} Krag-Jørgensen service rifle. Ruby was preferred, because tin-plating was required to protect brass cartridge cases from picric acid in the Peyton Powder. Rather than paying the required royalties for Ballistite, Laflin & Rand financed Leonard's reorganization as the American Smokeless Powder Company. United States Army Lieutenant Whistler assisted American Smokeless Powder Company factory superintendent Aspinwall in formulating an improved powder named W.A. for their efforts. W.A. smokeless powder was the standard for United States military service rifles from 1897 until 1908.|$|R
50|$|A {{historical}} {{use of the}} {{adhesive properties}} of sodium silicates is the production of paper cartridges for black powder revolvers produced by Colt's Manufacturing Company {{during the period from}} 1851 until 1873, especially during the American Civil War. Sodium silicate was used to seal combustible nitrated paper together to form a conical paper cartridge to hold the black powder, as well as to cement the lead ball or conical bullet into the open end of the paper cartridge. Such sodium silicate cemented paper cartridges were inserted into the cylinders of revolvers, thereby speeding the reloading of cap-and-ball black powder revolvers. This use largely ended with the introduction of Colt revolvers employing brass-cased <b>cartridges</b> <b>starting</b> in 1873. Similarly, sodium silicate was also used to cement the top wad into brass shotgun shells, thereby eliminating any need for a crimp {{at the top of the}} brass shotgun shell to hold a shotgun shell together. Reloading brass shotgun shells was widely practiced by self-reliant American farmers during the 1870s, using the same waterglass material that was also used to preserve eggs. The cementing of the top wad on a shotgun shell consisted of applying from three to five drops of waterglass on the top wad to secure it to the brass hull. Brass hulls for shotgun shells were superseded by paper hulls starting around 1877. The newer paper-hulled shotgun shells used a roll crimp in place of a waterglass-cemented joint to hold the top wad in the shell. However, whereas brass shotshells with top wads cemented with waterglass could be reloaded nearly indefinitely (given powder, wad, and shot, of course), the paper hulls that replaced the brass hulls could be reloaded only a few times.|$|R
