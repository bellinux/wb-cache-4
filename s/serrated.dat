5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa (dwarf forms) – Rod Parsons of Carawah Nursery in Victoria has two red-styled fairly compact dwarf forms, one (all <b>serrated</b> – slow-growing, {{possibly}} collina) {{growing to}} 1m, the (leaf ends <b>serrated</b> only, faster-growing) other 1.5m – {{and there are}} others reported but not named.|$|E
5|$|In the aye-aye, {{which has}} {{replaced}} the toothcomb by evolving continually growing, rodent-like incisors, the hook-shaped tip of the sublingua fits precisely within {{the gap between the}} two lower incisors and keeps the area clean. Tarsiers lack a toothcomb, which may explain why their sublingua lacks the serrations typically found on the sublingua of lemuriforms. Although colugos also have a toothcomb, consisting of <b>serrated</b> edges on the tips of their incisors instead of finely spaced, elongated teeth, {{they do not have a}} sublingua. Instead, their toothcomb is cleaned by the tongue, which has <b>serrated</b> edges at the front that match the serrations on the incisors.|$|E
5|$|Most of its fins (dorsal, pectoral, pelvic, and caudal) have white tips (juvenile {{specimens}} {{and some}} adults may lack these). Along with white tips, the fins may be mottled, and young specimens can have black marks. A saddle-like marking may be apparent between {{first and second}} dorsal fins. The shark has several kinds of teeth. Those in the mandible (lower jaw) have a thin, <b>serrated</b> tip and are relatively small and triangular (somewhat fang-like). Between 13 and 15 teeth are {{on either side of}} the symphysis. The teeth in the upper jaw are triangular, but much larger and broader with entirely <b>serrated</b> edges 14 or 15 occur along each side of the symphysis. The denticles lie flat and typically have between five and seven ridges.|$|E
5|$|The Borneo shark is slim-bodied, with a long, pointed snout and oblique, slit-like {{nostrils}} {{preceded by}} narrow, nipple-shaped flaps of skin. The eyes are rather large and circular, and equipped with nictitating membranes. The {{corners of the}} sizable mouth bear short, indistinct furrows, and immediately above {{are a series of}} enlarged pores that are unique within the genus. There are 25–26 upper and 23–25 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth have a single, narrow, oblique cusp with strongly <b>serrated</b> edges, and large cusplets on the trailing side. The lower teeth are similar, but tend to be more slender and finely <b>serrated.</b> The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{the creek}} whaler is {{spindle-shaped}} and rather stocky. The long snout has a narrowly parabolic shape and large nostrils preceded by small, nipple-shaped flaps of skin. The eyes are circular and of medium size, and are equipped with nictitating membranes. The arched mouth has very short furrows at the corners. There are 30 upper and 28–30 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth are long and triangular with strongly <b>serrated</b> edges, and become increasing angled towards {{the sides of the}} jaw. The lower teeth are slender and upright with finely <b>serrated</b> edges. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E
5|$|The {{copper shark}} has a slender, {{streamlined}} {{body with a}} slightly arched profile just behind the head. The snout is rather long and pointed, with the nostrils preceded by low flaps of skin. The round, moderately large eyes are equipped with nictating membranes (protective third eyelids). The mouth has short, subtle furrows at the corners and contains 29–35 upper tooth rows and 29–33 lower tooth rows. The teeth are <b>serrated</b> with single narrow cusps; the upper teeth have a distinctive hooked shape and become more angled towards {{the corners of the}} jaw, while the lower teeth are upright. The upper teeth of adult males are longer, narrower, more curved, and more finely <b>serrated</b> than those of adult females and juveniles. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly long.|$|E
5|$|The pigeye shark {{is a very}} robust-bodied {{species with}} a short, broad, and rounded snout. The small and {{circular}} eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes. The anterior rims of the nostrils bear medium-sized flaps of skin. The mouth forms a wide arch and has barely noticeable furrows at the corners. There are 11–13 (usually 12) upper and 10–12 (usually 11) lower tooth rows on each side; in addition, there are single rows of tiny teeth at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw midpoints). The teeth are broad and triangular with <b>serrated</b> edges; those in the lower jaw are slightly narrower, more upright, and more finely <b>serrated</b> than those in the upper. The five pairs of gill slits are of moderate length.|$|E
5|$|Banksia epica is a shrub {{that grows}} {{on the south}} coast of Western Australia. A {{spreading}} bush with wedge-shaped <b>serrated</b> leaves and large creamy-yellow flower spikes, it grows up to 3½metres (11½ft) high. It is known only from two isolated populations in the remote south east of the state, near {{the western edge of}} the Great Australian Bight. Both populations occur among coastal heath on cliff-top dunes of siliceous sand.|$|E
5|$|Herrerasaurus had a {{flexible}} joint {{in the lower}} jaw that could slide {{back and forth to}} deliver a grasping bite. This cranial specialization is unusual among dinosaurs but has evolved independently in some lizards. The rear of the lower jaw also had fenestrae. The jaws were equipped with large <b>serrated</b> teeth for biting and eating flesh, and the neck was slender and flexible.|$|E
5|$|Scientists do not {{yet know}} what these dinosaurs ate. Having very small, ridged teeth they could not have chewed tough, fibrous plants as {{effectively}} as other dinosaurs of the same period. It is assumed that pachycephalosaurs lived on a mixed diet of leaves, seeds, and fruits. The sharp, <b>serrated</b> teeth would have been very effective for shredding plants.|$|E
5|$|Tooth shape {{depends on}} the shark's diet: those that feed on mollusks and {{crustaceans}} have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with <b>serrated</b> edges for cutting. The teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{reworked}} Type 26s {{lack the}} bright charcoal blue finish or standard checked patterned grip panels. <b>Serrated</b> grip panels are common among reworked Type 26s and the marking of the Nagoya Arsenal indicate repairing of the Type 26 past its {{production at the}} Koshikawa Arsenal. Two existing arsenal reworked Type 26s show stampings of Siamese numerals on the front grips indicating official procurement by the Thai government. Two additional reworked Type 26s have a five-pointed star stamped on the side plate of the revolver indicating Indonesian service after World War II.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aculeata, {{commonly}} known as prickly banksia, is a species of plant of the family Proteaceae native to the Stirling Range in the southwest of Western Australia. A shrub up to 2m (7ft) tall, it has dense foliage and leaves with very prickly <b>serrated</b> margins. Its unusual pinkish, pendent (hanging) flower spikes, known as inflorescences, are generally hidden in the foliage and appear during the early summer. Although it was collected by the naturalist James Drummond in the 1840s, Banksia aculeata was not formally described until 1981—by Alex George in his monograph of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Banksia caleyi, {{commonly}} known as the red lantern banksia or Caley's banksia, is a species of woody shrub of the family Proteaceae native to Western Australia. It generally grows as a dense shrub up to 2m (7ft) tall, has <b>serrated</b> leaves and unusual red, pendent (hanging) inflorescences which are generally hidden in the foliage. First described by Scottish naturalist Robert Brown in 1830, Banksia caleyi was named in honour of the English botanist George Caley. No subspecies are recognised. It is one of three or four related species with hanging inflorescences, which is an unusual feature within the genus.|$|E
5|$|Banksia lemanniana, {{commonly}} known as the yellow lantern banksia or Lemann's banksia, is a species of woody shrub of the family Proteaceae native to Western Australia. It generally grows as an open shrub or small tree to five metres (15ft) high with stiff <b>serrated</b> leaves, and unusual hanging inflorescences. Flowering occurs over summer, the greenish buds developing into oval flower spikes before turning grey and developing the characteristic large woody follicles. It occurs within and just east of the Fitzgerald River National Park on the southern coast of the state. Banksia lemanniana is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed.|$|E
5|$|Like other nightjars, it {{will sit}} on roads or paths {{during the night}} and hover to {{investigate}} large intruders such as deer or humans. It may be mobbed by birds while there is still light, and by bats, other nightjar species or Eurasian woodcocks during the night. Owls and other predators such as red foxes will be mobbed by {{both male and female}} European nightjars. Like other aerial birds, such as swifts and swallows, nightjars make a quick plunge into water to wash. They have a unique <b>serrated</b> comb-like structure on the middle claw that is used to preen and perhaps remove parasites.|$|E
5|$|Only the <b>serrated</b> {{and often}} {{keratinized}} {{tip of the}} sublingua is free to move small distances along {{the underside of the}} tongue, while the majority of its length adheres to the underside of the tongue. These free-moving folds or filaments are called the plica fimbriata and attach {{to the base of the}} sublingua and are supported at the midline by the plica mediana. The plica fimbriata is highly developed and specialized in lemurs, and makes up the majority of the sublingua.|$|E
5|$|Rather heavily built, the bignose shark has a long, broad, and blunt snout {{with the}} {{nostrils}} preceded by well-developed, triangular flaps of skin. The moderately large, circular eyes {{are equipped with}} nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). The mouth is broadly curved and lacks obvious furrows at the corners. The upper teeth number 14–16 rows on either side and have tall, broad, triangular cusps with <b>serrated</b> edges; they are erect at the jaw center and become increasingly oblique towards the sides. The lower teeth number 14–15 rows on either side and have narrow, erect cusps with extremely fine serrations. The five pairs of gill slits are moderately long.|$|E
5|$|The Benchmade factory {{version was}} sold under the model name BM970 or BM975 {{depending}} on blade length. Other designations followed which denoted blade finish, manual or automatic opening, or partially <b>serrated</b> blade. The knife retained {{the profile of}} Emerson's custom piece {{in addition to the}} ATS-34 steel and the titanium liners. However, on Benchmade's offering the titanium bolsters and micarta scales were replaced with G10 fiberglass scales, the slotted screws were replaced by Torx head screws, and the pocket clip was repositioned so that the knife could be carried in the pocket in a tip-down position.|$|E
5|$|The Pondicherry shark (Carcharhinus hemiodon) is an {{extremely}} rare species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae. A small and stocky gray shark, it grows not much longer than , {{and it has a}} fairly long, pointed snout. This species can be identified by the shape of its upper teeth, which are strongly <b>serrated</b> near the base and smooth-edged near the tip, and by its first dorsal fin, which is large with a long free rear tip. Furthermore, this shark has prominent black tips on its pectoral fins, second dorsal fin, and caudal fin lower lobe.|$|E
5|$|The blacknose shark has a slender, {{streamlined}} {{body with a}} long, rounded snout and large eyes. There is a well-developed flap of skin {{in front of each}} nostril, defining the inflow and outflow openings. Twelve to 13 and 11 to 12 tooth rows occur {{on either side of the}} upper and lower jaws, respectively, with one or two teeth at the symphysis (middle). The teeth are triangular and oblique, with <b>serrated</b> edges; the upper teeth are stouter than the lower teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are short, measuring less a third the length of the first dorsal fin base.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} finetooth shark is {{slender and}} streamlined. The snout is long and pointed, with the nares preceded by short, broadly {{triangular}} flaps of skin. The eyes are large and round, with nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). The mouth is broad with well-defined furrows at the corners. Twelve to 15 tooth rows occur {{on either side of}} the upper jaw and 1314 tooth rows {{on either side of the}} lower jaw. Each tooth is small and needle-like, with a narrow central cusp and smooth to minutely <b>serrated</b> edges. The five pairs of gill slits are long, measuring about half the length of the dorsal fin base.|$|E
5|$|The broad, heavily calcified {{jaws and}} nearly {{terminal}} mouth, combined with robust, <b>serrated</b> teeth, enable the tiger shark {{to take on}} these large prey. In addition, excellent eyesight and acute sense of smell enable it to react to faint traces of blood and follow them to the source. The ability to pick up low-frequency pressure waves enables the shark to advance towards an animal with confidence, even in murky water. The shark circles its prey and studies it by prodding it with its snout. When attacking, the shark often eats its prey whole, although larger prey are often eaten in gradual large bites and finished over time.|$|E
5|$|The {{kitefin shark}} has a {{moderately}} elongated {{body with a}} very short, rounded snout. The eyes and spiracles are large. The lips are thick with pleats or fringes, though are not modified to be suctorial. There are 1621 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 1720 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The upper teeth are small and spike-shaped, curving slightly towards {{the corners of the}} mouth. The lower teeth are very large, knife-shaped, and <b>serrated,</b> with their bases interlocking to form a continuous cutting surface.|$|E
5|$|The nervous shark has {{a rather}} stout, {{spindle-shaped}} {{body and a}} short, broadly rounded snout. The anterior margin of each nostril is extended into a slender nipple-shaped lobe. The moderately large eyes are horizontally oval in shape and equipped with nictitating membranes. The mouth lacks conspicuous furrows at the corners and contains 25–30 upper and 23–28 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth are narrow and angled, with coarsely <b>serrated</b> edges. The lower teeth are more slender and upright in shape, and have finer serrations. The five pairs of gill slits are medium in length.|$|E
5|$|A rigid {{structure}} {{called the}} plica mediana or lytta {{runs from the}} front to the back, {{down the center of}} the sublingua to give it support. The plica mediana is usually made of cartilage and attaches the sublingua to the underside of the tongue. In lemuriforms, the sublingua mostly consists of two plicae fimbriatae (singular: plica fimbriata), which run along the sides of the plica mediana and end in comb-like <b>serrated</b> edges that are hardened with keratin. The plicae fimbriatae move freely over a limited range. The plica sublingualis, which is found in all primates, but is particularly small in lemuriforms, attaches the tongue and sublingua to the floor of the mouth. Tarsiers have a large but highly generalized sublingua, but their closest living relatives, monkeys and apes, lack one.|$|E
5|$|Banksia serrata, {{commonly}} known as old man banksia, saw banksia, saw-tooth banksia and red honeysuckle, is a species of woody shrub or tree of the genus Banksia in the family Proteaceae. Native to {{the east coast of}} Australia, it is found from Queensland to Victoria with outlying populations on Tasmania and Flinders Island. Commonly growing as a gnarled tree up to 16m (50ft) in height, it can be much smaller in more exposed areas. This Banksia species has wrinkled grey bark, shiny dark green <b>serrated</b> leaves and large yellow or greyish-yellow flower spikes appearing over summer. The flower spikes, or inflorescences, turn grey as they age and pollinated flowers develop into large, grey, woody seed pods called follicles.|$|E
5|$|Heterodontosaurids {{are named}} for their {{strongly}} heterodont dentition. There were three premaxillary teeth. In the Early Jurassic Abrictosaurus, Heterodontosaurus, and Lycorhinus, {{the first two}} premaxillary teeth were small and conical, while the much larger third tooth resembled the canines of carnivoran mammals and is often called the caniniform or 'tusk'. A lower caniniform, larger than the upper, took the first position in the dentary and was accommodated by the arched diastema of the upper jaw when the mouth was closed. These caniniforms were <b>serrated</b> on both the anterior and posterior edges in Heterodontosaurus and Lycorhinus, while those of Abrictosaurus bore serrations only on the anterior edge. In the Early Cretaceous Echinodon, {{there may have been}} two upper caniniforms, which were on the maxilla rather than the premaxilla, and Fruitadens from the Late Jurassic may have had two lower caniniforms on each dentary.|$|E
5|$|Many {{teeth are}} widest at their midsections and narrow {{closer to the}} jaws, giving them the {{appearance}} of a teardrop. Teardrop-shaped teeth are unique to Dimetrodon and other closely related sphenacodontids, and help distinguish them from other early synapsids. As in many other early synapsids, the teeth of most Dimetrodon species are <b>serrated</b> at their edges. The serrations of Dimetrodon teeth were so fine that they resembled tiny cracks. The dinosaur Albertosaurus had similarly crack-like serrations, but, at the base of each serration was a round void, which would have functioned to distribute force over a larger surface area and prevent the stresses of feeding from causing the crack to spread through the tooth. Unlike Albertosaurus, Dimetrodon teeth lacked adaptations that would stop cracks from forming at their serrations. The teeth of D.teutonis lack serrations, but still have sharp edges.|$|E
5|$|Physically, the Australian blacktip shark {{can only}} {{reliably}} {{be distinguished from}} the common blacktip shark {{by the number of}} vertebrae (174–182 total, 84–91 before the tail in C. tilstoni, 182–203 total, 94–102 before the tail in C. limbatus). It has a moderately robust, spindle-shaped body and a long, pointed snout. The anterior rims of the nostrils are slightly enlarged into low triangular flaps. The large, circular eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes. The furrows at the corners of the mouth are barely evident. There are 32–35 upper and 29–31 lower tooth rows; each upper tooth has a slender, upright cusp and fine serrations that become coarser near the base, while the lower teeth are narrower and more finely <b>serrated.</b> The five pairs of gill slits are long.|$|E
5|$|Slim and streamlined, {{the silky}} shark has a fairly long, rounded snout with barely {{developed}} flaps of skin {{in front of}} the nostrils. The circular, medium-sized eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). Short, shallow furrows are present at the corners of the mouth. Fourteen to 16 and 13–17tooth rows are found {{on either side of the}} upper and lower jaws, respectively (typically 15 for both). The upper teeth are triangular and strongly <b>serrated,</b> with a notch in the posterior edge; they are erect at the center and become more oblique towards the sides. The lower teeth are narrow, erect, and smooth-edged. The five pairs of gill slits are moderate in length.|$|E
5|$|The Pondicherry shark has {{a robust}} build and a {{moderately}} long, pointed snout. The large and circular eyes {{are equipped with}} nictitating membranes. Each nostril is broad with a small, narrow nipple-shaped lobe on the anterior rim. The arched mouth lacks conspicuous furrows or enlarged pores at the corners. The upper and lower jaws contain 14–15 and 12–14 tooth rows on either side respectively; in addition, there are one or two rows of small teeth at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw midpoints). The upper teeth have a single narrow, smooth-edged central cusp, flanked on both sides by very large serrations. The lower teeth are narrower and more upright than the uppers, and may be smooth to finely <b>serrated.</b> The five pairs of gill slits are fairly long.|$|E
5|$|The {{great white}} shark has a robust, large, conical snout. The upper and lower lobes on the tail fin are {{approximately}} the same size {{which is similar to}} some mackerel sharks. A great white displays countershading, by having a white underside and a grey dorsal area (sometimes in a brown or blue shade) that gives an overall mottled appearance. The coloration makes it difficult for prey to spot the shark because it breaks up the shark's outline when seen from the side. From above, the darker shade blends with the sea and from below it exposes a minimal silhouette against the sunlight. Great white sharks, like many other sharks, have rows of <b>serrated</b> teeth behind the main ones, ready to replace any that break off. When the shark bites, it shakes its head side-to-side, helping the teeth saw off large chunks of flesh.|$|E
5|$|The {{milk shark}} has a slender build with a long, pointed snout, large, round eyes with nictitating {{membranes}} (protective third eyelids), and no spiracles. On {{each side of}} the head behind the corner of the jaw, there are usually seven to 15 enlarged pores. The nostrils are small, as are the adjacent triangular skin flaps. There are long furrows at the corners of the mouth on both the upper and lower jaws. The tooth rows number 2425 in both jaws. The upper teeth are finely <b>serrated</b> and strongly oblique; the lower teeth have a similar shape, though the serrations are smaller and the tips curve gently upward. The teeth of juveniles are smooth-edged.|$|E
5|$|The night shark has {{a slender}} build with an elongated, pointed snout. The nares are flanked by {{moderately}} developed flaps of skin. The eyes are large, circular, and green in life, with irregularly shaped pupils and a nictitating membrane (protective third eyelid). The mouth lacks conspicuous furrows {{at the corners}} and usually bears 15 tooth rows {{on either side of}} both jaws, plus 12 upper and 1 lower symphysial (jaw midline) tooth rows. Each upper tooth has a smooth to <b>serrated</b> edge, a narrow cusp becoming more oblique towards the corner of the mouth, and 25 coarse serrations {{at the base of the}} trailing margin. The number and size of serrations on the leading margin of the tooth cusp increase relative to those on the trailing margin as the animal grows older. The lower teeth are upright and smooth-edged. The five pairs of gill slits are rather short.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the bluespotted ribbontail ray is oval in shape, around four-fifths {{as wide as}} long, with a rounded to broadly angular snout. The large, protruding eyes are immediately followed by the broad spiracles. There is a narrow flap of skin between the nares with a fringed posterior margin, reaching past the mouth. The lower jaw dips at the middle and deep furrows are present at the mouth corners. There are 15–24 tooth rows in either jaw, arranged into pavement-like plates, and two large papillae {{on the floor of}} the mouth. The pelvic fins are narrow and angular. The thick, depressed tail measures about 1.5 times the disc length and bears one or two (usually two) <b>serrated</b> spines well behind the tail base; there is a deep fin fold on the ventral surface, reaching the tip of the tail, and a low midline ridge on the upper surface.|$|E
