30|$|A well {{established}} instrument {{to regulate the}} risks of certain dangerous substances and mixtures are restrictions on manufacturing, {{placing on the market}} and use. New restrictions are introduced in <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII</b> of REACH. With the entering into force, existing restrictions already in place by the Chemicals Restrictions Directive [4] were directly integrated in <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{intention}} of the SiS concept is to regulate substances of very high concern as constituents or impurities in substances, mixtures, and in articles. In principle this is already realised in certain entries of <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII.</b> As a first case, Germany is preparing an Annex XV dossier for the PAH benzo[a]pyrene as substance in substance. Benzo[a]pyrene is the most prominent PAH known for CMR and vPvB-properties, and already regulated in mixtures for consumer uses (Annex XVIII), as an impurity in toys and as extender oil {{for the production of}} tyres or parts of tyres (<b>Annex</b> <b>XVII,</b> entry 50).|$|R
30|$|Due to its {{intrinsic}} properties, PFOA fulfills the REACH PBT-criteria. The next regulatory step will be {{the identification}} of PFOA and its ammonium salt (APFO) as SVHC according to REACH and the addition to the REACH Candidate List. As a second step, a restriction proposal will be prepared to include both substances and precursors into REACH <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Simply {{because a}} {{substance}} meets {{one or more}} of the criteria does not necessarily mean that it will be proposed as an SVHC. Many such substances are already subject to restrictions on their use within the European Union, such as those in <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII</b> of the REACH Regulation.

50|$|The Nickel Directive was a European Union {{directive}} {{regulating the}} use of nickel in jewellery and other products that {{come into contact with}} the skin. Since 1 June 2009, it has been subsumed into the REACH Regulation, specifically item 27 of <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII</b> to that regulation. Nevertheless, the term Nickel Directive is still used to refer to the restrictions on nickel usage and the prescribed test method for quantifying nickel release from products EN 1811.|$|R
30|$|Restrictions, as {{specified}} in <b>Annex</b> <b>XVII</b> of REACH, offer a powerful opportunity to improve {{health and environmental}} safety with respect to hazardous substances. We support an extended understanding of what {{is defined as a}} “substance of concern” in the context of restrictions. This definition should be broader than just what is currently covered by the term SVHC. Consequences of restrictions may equally apply to European producers and importers of articles from outside of Europe, which contain such substances of concern.|$|R
