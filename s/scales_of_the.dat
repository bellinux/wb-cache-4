5|$|Fruit body {{primordia}} first appear {{between the}} <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cones, and require 9 to 35 days {{to reach their}} final height. They consist of an inner core of thin-walled generative hyphae enclosed by an outer coat of skeletal hyphae. Immature fruit bodies are white and delicate, but gradually become brown as they mature. Because the cap is grown from the stem tip after it bends, cap development interrupts stem growth, and this shift to centrifugal growth (that is, growth outward from the stem) results in the typical kidney-shaped or semicircular cap. Although the fruit body takes at least 9 days to mature, spores production begins within 48–72 hours of the start of cap growth. Spines start out as minute protuberances {{on the part of}} the stem adjoining the undersurface of the cap. As the cap enlarges, these spines are spread horizontally, and more protuberances are formed, which elongate vertically downwards.|$|E
5|$|Like other snake species, {{the forest}} cobra has skin covered in scales. Snakes are entirely covered with scales or scutes of various shapes and sizes, known as snakeskin as a whole. Scales protect {{the body of}} the snake, aid it in locomotion, allow {{moisture}} to be retained within, and alter the surface characteristics such as roughness to aid in camouflage. The dorsal <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest cobra are smooth, glossy and strongly oblique. The colour of this species is variable, with three main colour morphs. Those from the forest or forest fringe, from Sierra Leone east to western Kenya and south to Angola are glossy black, the chin, throat and anterior region of the belly are cream or white, with broad black cross-bars and blotches. The sides of the head are strikingly marked with black and white, giving the impression of vertical black and white bars on the lips. The second colour morph, from the west African savanna, is banded black and yellow, with a black tail, the head is brownish-yellow on top, the lips, chin and throat are yellow. The third colour morph, from the coastal plain of east Africa, south to KwaZulu-Natal, inland to Zambia and southern Democratic Republic of Congo, is brownish or blackish-brown above, paler below, the belly is yellow or cream, heavily speckled with brown or black, and specimens from the southern part of its range have black tails. Melanistic (all black) specimens have been documented from west Africa.|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} {{believed}} that <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> ant system, {{and in general}} of ant colony optimization algorithms, depends somehow on <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem instance at hand.

In this paper, we show that although <b>the</b> internal state <b>of</b> ant system— that is, the pheromone matrix—depends on <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem instance under analysis, this does not affect <b>the</b> external behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> algorithm.

25|$|In a {{turbulent}} flow, {{there is a}} range of <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time-varying fluid motion. The size of the largest scales of fluid motion (sometimes called eddies) are set by the overall geometry of the flow. For instance, in an industrial smoke stack, the largest scales of fluid motion are {{as big as the}} diameter of the stack itself. The size of the smallest scales is set by the Reynolds number. As the Reynolds number increases, smaller and smaller <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flow are visible. In a smoke stack, the smoke may appear to have many very small velocity perturbations or eddies, in addition to large bulky eddies. In this sense, the Reynolds number is an indicator of the range of scales in the flow. The higher the Reynolds number, the greater the range of scales. The largest eddies will always be the same size; the smallest eddies are determined by the Reynolds number.|$|E

25|$|Nopcsa {{theorized that}} {{increasing}} {{the surface area}} of the outstretched arms could have helped small cursorial predators keep their balance, and that the <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forearms elongated, evolving into feathers. The feathers could also {{have been used to}} trap insects or other prey. Progressively, the animals leapt for longer distances, helped by their evolving wings. Nopcsa also proposed three stages in the evolution of flight. First, animals developed passive flight, in which developing wing structures served as a sort of parachute. Second, they achieved active flight by flapping the wings. He used Archaeopteryx as an example of this second stage. Finally, birds gained the ability to soar.|$|E

25|$|The African rock python's body {{is thick}} {{and covered with}} colored blotches, often joining up in a broad, {{irregular}} stripe.

Teeth are many, sharp, and backwardly curved. Under the eye, there is a distinctive triangular marking, the subocular mark. Like all pythons, the <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> African rock python are small and smooth.

25|$|Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) {{equations}} are {{the oldest}} approach to turbulence modeling. An ensemble {{version of the}} governing equations is solved, which introduces new apparent stresses known as Reynolds stresses. This adds a second order tensor of unknowns for which various models can provide different levels of closure. It is a common misconception that the RANS equations {{do not apply to}} flows with a time-varying mean flow because these equations are 'time-averaged'. In fact, statistically unsteady (or non-stationary) flows can equally be treated. This is sometimes referred to as URANS. There is nothing inherent in Reynolds averaging to preclude this, but the turbulence models used to close the equations are valid only as long as the time over which these changes in the mean occur is large compared to the time <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turbulent motion containing most of the energy.|$|E
