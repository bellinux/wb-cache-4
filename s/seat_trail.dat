5000|$|... "The {{most famous}} thing I ever did is I torched {{one of my}} postdocs," [...] says Levine. Joseph Corbo {{was there at the}} time. [...] "Mike got a squirt bottle of ethanol, unbeknownst to this hapless postdoc who was sitting at his bench minding his own business," [...] says Corbo. Levine shot a ring of ethanol around the young man's <b>seat</b> and <b>trailed</b> a wick into the hallway. Then he lit it. [...] "So this tongue of flame snaked into the lab and encircled this postdoc," [...] says Corbo. [...] "My {{technique}} was a little off and I put a little too much ethanol around his bench. So it's true, he was temporarily enveloped in a curtain of fire," [...] says Levine. [...] "But the fire receded and he was ok." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1987, Scott instead {{ran for the}} District 29 {{state senate}} seat {{previously}} held by his colleague, Ned Randolph, who had become mayor of Alexandria. It was Edward J. Steimel, the founding president of the Baton Rouge-based trade association, the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry or LABI, who urged Scott to make the senatorial race. Like Randolph four years earlier, however, Scott was defeated by the Democrat William Joseph [...] "Joe" [...] McPherson, Jr., a businessman from Pineville, later Woodworth. McPherson, who finally retired from the seat in 2012, carried the backing of Louisiana AFL-CIO President Victor Bussie. McPherson polled 16,950 (51 percent) in the primary and hence retained the <b>seat</b> outright. Scott <b>trailed</b> with 12,346 votes (37 percent). Former state senator Cecil Blair sought a comeback but netted only 4,245 votes (13 percent).|$|R
5000|$|The C.220 was {{powered by}} a [...] Salmson 7AC seven {{cylinder}} radial engine driving a metal, two blade propeller. One photograph shows the engine uncowled though the second aircraft, the C.221, which had a [...] Lorraine 5P five cylinder radial and was otherwise identical apart from using a different make of propeller, was recorded both with and without a narrow chord Townend ring type cowling. Behind the engine the fuselage was a box girder structure covered in plywood, though the upper decking was rounded. The forward of the two open tandem cockpits was placed between the wings at about mid-chord with the rear <b>seat</b> behind the <b>trailing</b> edge. The C.220 had a triangular fin and an unbalanced rudder with straight, parallel side and rounded top and bottom. The horizontal tail was fixed to the upper fuselage longerons. There was a fixed, tail wheel undercarriage.|$|R
50|$|In 1987, Blair {{attempted}} {{to regain the}} Senate seat. He and outgoing state Representative Jock Scott, then a convert to the Republican Party, challenged McPherson, who {{had the support of}} organized labor. McPherson polled 16,950 (51 percent) in the primary and hence retained the <b>seat</b> outright. Scott <b>trailed</b> with 12,346 votes (37 percent). Blair netted 4,245 votes (13 percent). In 1995, Blair once more {{attempted to}} regain the Senate seat but failed to make the general election runoff in a field of seven candidates. The Senate seat was won by the Reverend B.G. Dyess, the retired Rapides Parish voter registrar and a Baptist clergyman who campaigned against gambling. Dyess served for four years and, because of his wife's health, did not seek a second term in 1999. McPherson made an unsuccessful bid for Public Service Commissioner in 1995 and lost to Dale Sittig of Eunice. McPherson returned to the Senate in 2000 and easily won a third consecutive term in the jungle primary held on October 20, 2007.|$|R
50|$|The Star Monoplane had an {{uncovered}} triangular section fuselage of wire-braced ash, {{with the}} wings {{attached to the}} upper longerons and the pilot <b>seated</b> behind the <b>trailing</b> edge of the wing. The fuselage divided into two sections aft of the cockpit for ease of transportation. The parallel-chord wings had rounded ends and wing warping control, the wires leading to a single king-post above the wing and {{to the ends of}} the undercarriage struts, which bore twin skids, carrying two wheels on a sprung axle. The tail surfaces consisted of a cruciform arrangement of four elongated triangular surfaces starting halfway down the fuselage, ending in raked ends bearing the outer pivots of the moving surfaces, each of which was an elongated diamond shape resembling a Malay kite. These could be used conventionally as rudders and elevators or alternatively operated as linked opposing pairs, so that their operation would cause the aircraft to roll to one side or the other. It was powered by a 30 hp (22 kW) Star engine driving a 6 ft 8 in (2 m) Clarke propeller.|$|R
