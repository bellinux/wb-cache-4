5|$|Congress sanctioned the {{economic}} emergency {{law and the}} state reform law. The first allowed the president to reduce or remove subsidies, and the latter to privatize state enterprises – the first being telephones and airlines. These privatizations were beneficial to foreign creditors, who replaced their bonds with company shares. Despite increased tax revenue, and the money from privatizations, the economy was still unstable. The Bunge and Born businessmen left the government in late 1989, amid {{a second round of}} hyperinflation. The first measure of the new minister of economy, Érman González, was a mandatory conversion of time deposits into government bonds: the Bonex plan. It generated more recession, but hyperinflation was reduced. He also reduces <b>social</b> <b>spending,</b> including those for people with disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Under Morales, Bolivia {{experienced}} unprecedented economic strength, {{resulting in}} the increase in value of its currency, the boliviano. His {{first year in office}} ended with no fiscal deficit; the first time this had happened in Bolivia for 30 years, while during the global financial crisis of 2007–08 it maintained some of the world's highest levels of economic growth. Such economic strength led to a nationwide boom in construction, and allowed the state to build up strong financial reserves. Although the levels of <b>social</b> <b>spending</b> were increased, they remained relatively conservative, with a major priority being placed on constructing paved roads, as well as community spaces such as soccer fields and union buildings. In particular, the government focused on rural infrastructure improvement, to bring roads, running water, and electricity to areas that lacked them.|$|E

Issue ownership theory posits that when social welfare is electorally salient, left-wing parties gain public support by rhetorically emphasizing social welfare issues. There is less research, however, on whether left-wing governing parties benefit from increasing <b>social</b> welfare <b>spending,</b> i. e., we do not know whether leftist governments gain from acting on the issues they rhetorically emphasize. We present arguments that voters will not react to governments’ social welfare rhetoric, and we also review the conflicting arguments about how government support responds to <b>social</b> welfare <b>spending.</b> We then report time-series, cross-sectional analyses of data on government support, governments’ social welfare rhetoric and <b>social</b> welfare <b>spending</b> from Britain, Spain, and the United States, that support our prediction of no effects from government rhetoric. We estimate, however, that increased <b>social</b> welfare <b>spending</b> sharply depresses support for both leftand right-wing governments. Our findings identify a strategic dilemma for left-wing governments, who lose public support when they act on their social welfare rhetoric by actually increasing welfare spending.

On the right, the Legitimists and Ultra-royalists held counter-revolutionary views, while the Orléanists hoped to create a constitutional monarchy under their preferred branch of the royal family, a brief reality after the 1830 July Revolution. The centre-right Gaullists in post-World War II France advocated considerable <b>social</b> <b>spending</b> on education and infrastructure development as well as extensive economic regulation, but limited the wealth redistribution measures characteristic of social democracy.|$|E

25|$|Fiscal policy {{decisions}} {{so far have}} been mostly discretionary, as there is no explicit goal for fiscal policy. Looking forward, the question of a possible anchor for medium-term fiscal policy is worth exploring. Morocco's low social indicators and large infrastructure needs could justify an increase in <b>social</b> <b>spending</b> and public investment. Further, some nominal tax rates remain high by international standards, possibly warranting a lowering of some rates. At the same time, the relatively high level of public debt remains a constraining factor, particularly as heightened attractiveness to investors is a key component of Morocco's strategy of deepening its integration in the global economy.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, {{international}} organizations began {{to admit that}} structural adjustment policies were worsening life for the world's poor. The World Bank changed structural adjustment loans, allowing for <b>social</b> <b>spending</b> to be maintained, and encouraging a slower change to policies such as transfer of subsidies and price rises. In 1999, the World Bank and the IMF introduced the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach to replace structural adjustment loans. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach has been interpreted {{as an extension of}} structural adjustment policies as it continues to reinforce and legitimize global inequities. Neither approach has addressed the inherent flaws within the global economy that contribute to economic and social inequities within developing countries.|$|E

Local (non-central government) sources of revenue are incomes from various taxes such as vehicle ownership and vehicle transfer fees among others. The ability of the regional government to respond to the many problems of Jakarta is constrained by extremely limited finances. In 2013 the total budget available to the Jakarta regional government was approved at around Rp 50trillion (about $US 5.2billion), equivalent to around $US 380 per citizen.

25|$|By 1952 the Bolivian {{economy had}} {{deteriorated}} even further. The {{governments of the}} sexenio had been reluctant to increase taxes for the upper class and to reduce <b>social</b> <b>spending,</b> resulting in high inflation. The tin industry had stagnated since the Great Depression, despite short revivals during World War II. Ore content had declined, and the richer veins were depleted, increasing tin production costs; at the same time, tin prices on the international market fell. A disagreement with the United States over tin prices halted exports temporarily and caused a decline in income that further hurt the economy. The agricultural sector lacked capital, and food imports had increased, reaching 19% of total imports in 1950. Land was unequally distributed - 92% of the cultivable land was held by estates of 1,000 hectares or more.|$|E
25|$|Another {{cause is}} {{the rate at}} which income is taxed coupled with the {{progressivity}} of the tax system. A progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases. In a progressive tax system, the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society, either increasing it or decreasing it, provided that income does not change {{as a result of the}} change in tax regime. Additionally, steeper tax progressivity applied to <b>social</b> <b>spending</b> can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board. The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.|$|E
25|$|In 1966 the {{coalition}} of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) fell and a grand coalition between CDU/CSU and SPD was formed {{under the leadership of}} CDU Chancellor Kiesinger. The welfare state was considerably expanded, while <b>social</b> <b>spending</b> was almost doubled between 1969 and 1975. Changes were made to income maintenance schemes which met some of the SPD’s long-standing demands, and many other social reforms were introduced, including the equalising of wages and salaries between white-collar and blue-collar employees, the continuation of wage and salary payments, a law to promote employment, and a vocational training law. Although these measures were largely due to the efforts of the CDU minister Hans Katzer, it is arguable that he would never have been able to push his programme through the cabinet (let alone envisage it) without the SPD.|$|E
