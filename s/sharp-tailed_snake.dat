50|$|<b>Sharp-tailed</b> <b>snakes</b> are shy, secretive creatures {{most often}} {{encountered}} under rocks and logs, and rarely to never {{found in the}} open. They are able to persist in urban areas where appropriate cover can be found. They are known to burrow into soft soil or cracks in the clay, and may be encountered {{by people who are}} digging in the garden or removing concrete. When encountered, <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>snakes</b> may roll into a ball and remain still. They can be mistaken for worms to the casual observer. Their diet is largely restricted to slugs and insects.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>snake</b> or sharptail snake (Contia tenuis) {{is a small}} {{colubrid}} snake {{that lives}} in the Western United States and some parts of British Columbia.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>snake</b> averages {{from eight}} to twelve inches long as an adult. It is {{distinguished}} by its sharp tail spine, {{which is the}} protruding tip of the last tail vertebra. The spine is not toxic and cannot injure humans. Rather, the tail is used to stabilize small prey, such as slugs, for consumption. The dorsal surface ranges in color from greyish brown to brown to brick red, with bubble-gum pink and peachy-orange specimens occasionally found. The ventral surface is a striking series {{of black and white}} bars.|$|E
40|$|Extended Abstract: Habitat loss, alteration, and {{fragmentation}} are {{the main}} factors that threaten the endangered <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>snake</b> (Contia tenuis) throughout its Canadian range, which occurs on the southern Gulf Islands and southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Although the species can tolerate some degree of disturbance and can coexist with humans, intensified urban development associated with an expanding human population, threatens its survival. For example, a property next to a site known {{to be used by}} sharp-tailed snakes was cleared to the bedrock before housing construction took place; as a result no <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>snake</b> habitat remains there. In this paper, we outline proactive, ‘snake-friendly ’ land management practices and summarize small-scale restoration projects that we have initiated. As part of a stewardship project, and in collaboration with the <b>Sharp-tailed</b> <b>Snake</b> Recovery Team, we developed a brochure that encourages residents within the sharp-tailed snake’s range to adopt snake-friendly landscaping and gardening practices. This brochure informs landowners and land managers about design, maintenance, and proactive measures that will benefit this and other species of reptiles, all of which are harmless to humans. Both the <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>snake</b> and the northwestern garter snake (Thamnophis ordinoides) feed extensively on slugs, and may hel...|$|E
40|$|Extended Abstract: In Canada, the {{endangered}} <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>snake</b> (Contia tenuis) is known from {{only a few}} localities on the southern Gulf Islands and southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia. These areas are heavily modified, and the human population continues to increase at a rapid rate. Because most of the known localities of the <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>snake</b> are on private lands, stewardship by landowners {{is essential for the}} survival of the species. Potential habitat also exists on publicly-owned lands, including the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve and lands managed by the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Coast Guard within the Capital Regional District. Stewardship and protection of <b>sharp-tailed</b> <b>snake</b> habitats within these lands is also important. The goals of the stewardship efforts initiated by the <b>Sharp-tailed</b> <b>Snake</b> Recovery Team are to (1) educate the public, landowners, and resource managers about habitat management practices that are beneficial to the species, (2) encourage the establishment of conservation covenants on private lands, (3) restore habitat at selected sites, (4) train landowners to monitor populations, and (5) locate possible undiscovered populations so that appropriate protection measures can be applied. To contribute to these goals, we developed and delivered a multi-media presentation t...|$|E
