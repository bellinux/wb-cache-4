Examines, therefore, proposed reforms in the following areas: the setting up of a partnership (particularly the proposal for a system of registration), the introduction of separate legal personality (and its effect on, inter alia, continuity, land and other property ownership contracts and the execution of deeds), and reforms affecting the relationships of partners (for example, the proposal to <b>increase</b> <b>statutory</b> duties owed to the partnership and partners). Provides the author's own recommendations for reform and concludes that, although most of the proposed reforms (notably the introduction of separate legal personality) are justifiable and should not have an adverse impact on flexibility, informality and privacy, other proposals, in particular registration and <b>increased</b> <b>statutory</b> duties, would have adverse effects on these qualities and should not be adopted...|$|R

40|$|Economists {{generally}} view environmental enforcement {{as a tool}} {{to secure}} compliance with regulations. This paper demonstrates that credible enforcement significantly <b>increases</b> <b>statutory</b> overcompliance with regulations as well. We find that many plants with discharges typically below legally permitted levels reduce discharges further when regulators issue fines, even on other plants. Also, likely non-compliant plants often respond to sanctions by reducing discharges well beyond reductions required by law. Thus, increased enforcement generates substantial discharge reductions above and beyond those expected from simply deterring violations.

40|$|In {{order to}} succeed in a tort suit under {{negligence}} per se, a victim must be {{of the class of}} persons protected by the statute and his injury must be of the type that the statute was intended to prevent. Referring to them as 2 ̆ 2 the limiting liability conditions 2 ̆ 2, this Article calls for a diminishment of their role in determining liability in torts. It is argued that whenever non-compliance with a <b>statutory</b> provision <b>increases</b> risks to the class of persons the victim belongs to or of the type of injury the victim suffered and those risks are foreseeable, there is a strong prima facie case for recognizing liability. This is valid even when the risks that materialized are usual, or background, risks that in themselves would not justify the enactment of the statute. The Article also shows that many court decisions that applied the limiting liability conditions and excluded tort liability because the conditions were not met could have reached the same outcome but on different grounds. Finally, the Article extends its normative argument to common law negligence...|$|R

40|$|Overview: The audit {{found that}} Victoria Legal Aid (VLA) is {{performing}} its role delivering legal aid services across Victoria, and prioritising {{the most vulnerable}} people based on a sound understanding of demand drivers and funding risks. VLA is providing its services in a challenging environment of increased demand and with fixed funding that is largely based on demand levels from 2008. Determining {{the extent to which}} VLA is providing services effectively, efficiently and economically is constrained, however, by its performance monitoring framework, which does not clearly inform VLA 2 ̆ 7 s board or the public about how well it is achieving its <b>statutory</b> objectives. <b>Increased</b> demand has resulted in VLA tightening eligibility for its more intensive and costly legal services in order to remain financially sustainable. This has had the effect of reducing {{the number of people who}} are eligible for legal representation, while moving more people to less intensive services. While these actions are consistent with VLA 2 ̆ 7 s legal obligations, this has implications for access to justice. There are gaps in some areas of its service delivery, and VLA is actively addressing these gaps to improve services...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{assesses the}} {{evolution}} of public and occupational pension regimes in Britain and Germany from 1945 to 2009 {{in relation to the}} conservative and liberal welfare state regimes and the coordinated and liberal market economies. It argues that the liberal label has never appropriately captured the nature of British pensions, because it overlooked the strong role of the state as regulator and employer. Regarding Germany, the conservative label characterises well the situation between 1957 and 2000. After that, the retrenchment of the <b>statutory</b> pension and <b>increased</b> state support of voluntary savings have undermined status preservation more than expected by theorists of coordinated capitalism. Both systems have therefore developed in opposing directions, Britain towards social democracy and Germany towards liberalism...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} between specific job characteristics and subsequent cardiovascular disease {{was tested using}} a large random sample of the male working Swedish population. The prospective development of coronary heart disease (CHD) symptoms and signs was analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression technique. Additionally, a case-controlled study was used to analyze all cardiovascular-cerebrovascular (CHD-CVD) deaths during a six-year follow-up. The indicator of CHD symptoms and signs was validated in a six-year prospective study of CHD deaths (standardized mortality ratio 5. 0; p {{less than or equal}} to. 001). A hectic and psychologically demanding job increases the risk of developing CHD symptoms and signs (standardized odds ratio 1. 29, p less than 0. 25) and premature CHD-CVD death (relative risk 4. 0, p less than. 01). Low decision latitude-expressed as low intellectual discretion and low personal schedule freedom-is also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Low intellectual discretion predicts the development of CHD symptoms and signs (SOR 1. 44, p less than. 01), while low personal schedule freedom among the majority of workers with the minimum <b>statutory</b> education <b>increases</b> the risk of CHD-CVD death (RR 6. 6, p less than. 0002).

It has been determined that both these methods are more effective than just increasing the generation held in reserve for frequency response. The outcome of this research supports the growing body of evidence in literature for the procurement of rapid response subject to further research and testing on the UK grid...|$|R

Administrative concerns include lack of contracting authority at the fleet level and loss of control of resources; reduced flexibility; profit motives of contractors; and potential of contractor corruption. Recommendations include determining exact requirements and stating them unambiguously in the contract; intensifying training for contractor administrators; factoring in the costs of oversight; ensuring that a competitive environment exists among contractors prior to outsourcing; and taking stringent precautions against contractor corruption.
