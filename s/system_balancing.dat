Examples include a mechanism for comparing batch totals between an original data source and data transferred into a new application. Exception reporting relates to reporting of exception items to management so that more effective use of management time can be achieved. For example, the Sales Manager could potentially review all sales transactions for a day. But it is more time-efficient if the review and approval process is focused on transactions that are not sold at the list price, or sold above a certain pre-determined percentage of discount.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the balance}} of power <b>system,</b> <b>balancing</b> is opposed to the concept of bandwagoning, whereby smaller states seek to achieve their {{security}} by allying with the major power or a dominant actor. As tempting as this option may be for smaller powers, it can essentially undermine the security of the international system because by joining an alliance with a rising, potentially expansionist state, aggression and expansionist motives are being rewarded and accepted. It {{is in the interest of}} states to form coalitions with others with similar or lesser power in order to build their defensive and deterrent capabilities and through this discourage and prevent a growing power from becoming too strong and dominant. Afterall, as Waltz summed it up, [...] "states... flock to the weaker side, for it is the stronger side that threatens them".|$|E

The building is completely powered by wind-generated power and became the first building in Philadelphia of this size to use wind energy as the sole source of energy. In 2012, Post Brothers announced that they would commence with the refurbishment of the Goldtex building, at an estimated cost of $40 million. When completed, the building would be home to approximately 160 loft-style apartments, ranging from studios to three-bedrooms; and 7,000 square feet of retail space.

50|$|Model {{predictive}} control (MPC) is {{an advanced method}} of process control {{that has been in}} use in the process industries in chemical plants and oil refineries since the 1980s. In recent years it has also been used in power <b>system</b> <b>balancing</b> models. Model {{predictive control}}lers rely on dynamic models of the process, most often linear empirical models obtained by system identification. The main advantage of MPC {{is the fact that it}} allows the current timeslot to be optimized, while keeping future timeslots in account. This is achieved by optimizing a finite time-horizon, but only implementing the current timeslot. MPC has the ability to anticipate future events and can take control actions accordingly. PID and LQR controllers do not have this predictive ability. MPC is nearly universally implemented as a digital control, although there is research into achieving faster response times with specially designed analog circuitry.|$|E

5000|$|In April 2008 Ofgem {{launched}} {{an investigation into}} allegations that Scottish Power abused their dominant market position relating to the electricity transmission network they own jointly in Scotland. Ofgem said it had launched its inquiry into Scottish Power and Scottish & Southern Energy under section 18 of the Competition Act, [...] "based on a formal complaint alleging abuse of a dominant position in the electricity generation sector arising from constrained capacity on the transmission network." [...] The energy regulator believes that energy generators manipulate the power market for profit when supplies are tight because network operator National Grid has to pay utilities to turn their plants on or off to balance supply and demand. This resulted in companies deliberately shutting their plants down when supplies are tight {{in order to receive}} a higher payment to start up again, increasing the <b>system</b> <b>balancing</b> costs at the expense of consumers. Ofgem were alarmed that the cost of balancing the system increased from £70 million in 2007/08 to an estimated £238 million for 2008/09 and an expected £258 million in 2009/10, with most of the costs incurred in Scotland. In January 2009, Ofgem suspended the investigation, saying it would be more effective to deal with the wider problem than pursuing the specific case further.|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to trigger the devolution of the <b>system</b> <b>balancing</b> responsibility entirely belonging to the transmission system operator (TSO) to several local distribution system operators by fairly allocating <b>system</b> <b>balancing</b> cost based on a cost-causality principle. Within the devolved <b>system</b> <b>balancing</b> scheme, distribution system operators (DSOs) have appropriate motivation for reducing the variability and uncertainty caused by units in their own area. As the number of renewable electricity sources (RES) being connected to the local distribution system increases, it would be advantageous for the TSO to share the increasing burden of the <b>system</b> <b>balancing</b> responsibility with multiple DSOs. To achieve this, we suggest that, first DSOs be designated as the representatives of their own jurisdictions with primary economic responsibility for balancing payments that are originally charged to each energy market participant. Second, {{this research}} proves that a cost-causality based cost allocation scheme(CC-CAS) is superior to an energy-amount based cost allocation scheme (currently widely used) in terms of economic efficiency. Additionally, to avoid the side effect that a DSO with a large amount of RES may face a high and risky balancing payment under the CC-CAS, this research also proposes an optimal balancing payment insurance (BPI) contract which helps the DSO hedge the risks associated with uncertain balancing payments...|$|E
