40|$|Smart {{polymers}} are utilised for {{a variety}} of functions. This project aimed to produce a polymer which exhibits fluorescent emission in response to tensile stimuli. Previous fluorescence studies have shown this to be theoretically possible and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques can be used to establish the existence of such responses. A wide range of elastomers (styrene butadiene rubber, polyacrylates, polyurethane acrylates and polyurethanes) have been synthesised with aliphatic polyurethane elastomers being the most promising thus far. Fluorescent labels (9 -vinylanthracene, fluorescein and 1, 5 -dihydroxynaphthalene) have been successfully incorporated into elastomeric products as have heavy atom containing species (4 -bromostyrene, 3 -bromo- 1, 2 -propane diol and 4 -bromoresorcinol). A library of fluorescent and quenching prepolymers was built up which was then used {{in a wide range of}} combinations to produce elastomers containing both fluorophore and heavy atom containing species. Quenching of the excited state was observed in solution for most fluorophore/heavy atom combinations. 4 -Bromostyrene was shown to quench 9 -vinylanthracene within <b>solid</b> <b>cross-linked</b> elastomers. 1, 5 -dihydroxynaphthalene was also successfully quenched within polymer sheets however the emission wavelength of 1, 5 -dihydroxynaphthalene is not visible to the naked eye. Fluorescein emits visible light but has not been successfully quenched within cross-linked elastomers, with the lifetimes actually increasing in some samples. This observation was attributed to delayed fluorescence resulting from triplet-triplet annihilation promoted by the intersystem crossing to the triplet state brought about by the heavy atom. Generally speaking, the incorporation of fluorescent labels into solid elastomeric sheets had the effect of increasing the lifetime of the associated excited state. This is probably due to the polymer protecting the excited states from quenching due to atmospheric oxygen. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} a simple method to {{evaluate}} biocompatibility of <b>solid</b> UV <b>cross-linked</b> resin as a material for microfluidic devices {{that can be}} used for biological applications. We evaluated the biocompatibility of the material in two different ways (1) determining if the UV cured resin inhibits the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and (2) observing agglutination complex formed on the surface of the UV cured resin when anti-CRP antibodies and C- reactive protein (CRP) proteins were allowed to agglutinate. Six different types of 3 D printer resins were compared to test the biocompatibility. The study showed that only few among them could be used for fabrication of micro channels and that had least effect on biological molecules that could be used for PCR and protein interactions. Through these studies it is possible to estimate the curing time of various resin and their type of interaction with biomolecules.

40|$|Hyperelastic {{materials}} {{are characterized by}} an energy-preserving behavior which results in an identical path for loading, unloading and reloading. Rubbery materials consist frequently on a <b>cross-linked</b> elastomeric <b>substance</b> containing some percentage of particles of carbon as fillers. Due to such fillers, for example, the virgin loading path differs substantially from the unloading-reloading one. The behavior may then {{be considered as a}} result of damage in the material. This effect is known as part of the Mullins effect and is present not only in carbon-filled rubbers but also in biological materials. In this paper we present a novel formulation of continuum damage mechanics in hyperelastic materials and an efficient computational procedure for modelling the Mullins effect in isochoric, isotropic materials. The formulation is {{based on the idea that}} undamaged hyperelastic behavior cannot be measured, but the unloadingreloading behavior of a damaged material can be readily obtained and on that only the unloading reloading curve presents a real hyperelastic behavior. The unloadingreloading curve may be described by any appropriate constitutive model but using spline-based functions both the virgin loading and the unloading reloading curves are exactly captured. The model is efficient for finite element implementation...|$|R

The dynamic shapes of the liquids in the capillaries are obtained as <b>solid</b> polymers <b>cross-linked</b> photochemically and examined using scanning electron and atomic force microscopies. The shape of the imbibing liquid on a surface with high çSV shows that precursor structures precede macroscopic flow; on low çSV, these precursor structures are absent. Rates of capillary imbibition are linearly correlated to the cosine of static advancing contact angles (ıa) of a liquid prepolymer on different SAMs. Different regimes of spreading are observed on a surface having constant, low çSV; in regions close to the origin, the liquid spreads with low ıa and via precursor structures.

UV-curing takes place at room temperature and {{it is based on}} initiating a chemical polymerisation inside a liquid poly-functional monomer, containing a proper photo-initiator, using direct UV-irradiation to create a highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>solid</b> film. The present communication illustrates the results obtained from the investigation of a class of polymeric networks prepared by incorporating siloxane-based monomers into a methacrylic-based polymer matrix.

The polymer electrolyte was prepared by swelling the obtained membrane in a LiTFSI-EC-DEC solution. The chemical and structural properties were characterised by real-time FT-IR, TGA, DSC, and their surface characteristics were assessed by dynamic contact-angle measurements. Electrochemical tests on ionic conductivity, stability and cyclability in lithium cells pointed out the importance of the co-polymerisation in the presence of siloxane acrylates which improved the interfacial properties of the gel-copolymer membranes.

However, molecular simulation of thermoset polymers in particular, such as epoxies, present specific challenges, chiefly in the credible preparation of polymerised samples. Despite this need, a comprehensive, reproducible and robust process for accomplishing this using molecular simulation is still lacking. Here, we introduce a clear and reproducible cross-linking protocol to reliably generate three dimensional epoxy cross-linked polymer structures for use in molecular simulations. This protocol is sufficiently detailed to allow complete reproduction of our results, and is applicable to any general thermoset polymer. Amongst our developments, key features include a reproducible procedure for calculation of partial atomic charges, a reliable process for generating and validating an equilibrated liquid precursor mixture, and establishment of a novel, robust and reproducible protocol for generating the three-dimensional <b>cross-linked</b> <b>solid</b> polymer. We use these structures as input to subsequent molecular dynamics simulations to calculate a range thermo-mechanical properties, which compare favourably with experimental data.

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the composition and}} bonding structure of hydrogenated carbon nitride (a-CNx:H) films synthesized by electron cyclotron resonance chemical vapor deposition using as precursor gases argon, methane, and nitrogen. The composition of the films was derived from Rutherford backscattering and elastic recoil detection analysis and the bonding structure was examined by infrared (IR) spectroscopy and x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES). By varying the nitrogen to methane ratio in the applied gas mixture, polymeric a-CNx:H films with N/C contents varying from 0. 06 to 0. 49 were obtained. Remarkably, the H content of the films (similar to 40 at. %) was rather unaffected by the nitrogenation process. The different bonding states as detected in the measured XANES C(1 s) and N(1 s) spectra have been correlated with those {{of a large number}} of reference samples. The XANES and IR spectroscopy results indicate that N atoms are efficiently incorporated into the amorphous carbon network and can be found in different bonding environments, such as pyridinelike, graphitelike, nitrilelike, and amino groups. The nitrogenation of the films results in the formation of N-H bonding environments at the cost of C-H structures. Also, the insertion of N induces a higher fraction of double bonds in the structure at the expense of the linear polymerlike chains, hence resulting in a more <b>cross-linked</b> <b>solid.</b> The formation of double bonds takes place through complex C=N structures and not by formation of graphitic aromatic rings. Also, the mechanical and tribological properties (hardness, friction, and wear) of the films have been studied as a function of the nitrogen content. Despite the major modifications in the bonding structure with nitrogen uptake, no significant changes in these properties are observed. (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics. status: publishe...|$|R

Relatively few peaks are observed in the nuclear Overhauser effect spectra, indicating that overall the protein is dynamic and unstructured. The radius of gyration of AN 16 corresponds to the value expected for a denatured protein of similar chain length. This high degree of disorder is also consistent with observed circular dichroism and Raman spectra. The temperature dependences of the NH proton chemical shifts were also measured. Most values were indicative of protons exposed to water, although smaller dependences were observed for glycine and alanine within the Tyr-Gly-Ala-Pro sequence conserved in all resilins found to date, which is the site of dityrosine cross-link formation.

40|$|Multiphoton {{absorption}} polymerization (MAP) {{is gaining}} importance {{as a means}} for fabricating 3 -D micro-devices. By focusing an ultrafast laser inside a prepolymer resin, radical polymerization can be initiated by two-photon absorption of a photoinitiator. The result is a highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>solid</b> polymer point, or voxel, which is extended to create complex shapes by scanning the laser beam in a 3 -D pattern. The geometric freedom combined with sub-micron resolution provided by MAP is unparalleled by any other microfabrication techniques. However, MAP suffers from three issues; the novelty of the technique itself, {{the fact that it is}} inherently a serial process, and the restriction of device materials to cross-linking polymers. To better understand the technique, the MAP fabrication setup is described in detail. Specific techniques of fabrication, such as how to design and wash microstructures, are also described. To address the second issue, micro-transfer molding (&# 61549;TM) has been applied to make high fidelity molds of complex master microstructures, followed by a fast and easy replication step to make duplicate structures. This technique has even been extended to replicate structures with closed-loops, such as arches or coils, which should be topologically impossible to mold and replicate. The third issue has been addressed in two ways, by laser-direct-writing of metal patterns on 3 -D substrates and by changing the surface chemistry of the polymer to contain primary amines. Laser-deposited metal can be made conductive by further electroless growth yielding 3 -D conducting patterns. The amine surface modification can be used for any number of chemistries, including catalytic metal seeding, which could then be grown into a metal coating. This new flexibility in surface chemistry, along with the enhanced speed of &# 61549;TM, ensures that MAP will be a practical technology to create micro-devices. Numerous electrical, mechanical, optical, and biological applications of MAP are described as well as potential future applications.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. October 2012. Major: Material Science and Engineering. Advisors: C. Daniel Frisbie and Timothy P. Lodge. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 181 pages, appendices A-B. Block copolymer-based (BCP) ion gels are {{a class of}} interesting solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) in electrochemical applications. This thesis aims to systematically study the mechanical and electrical properties of BCP-based ion gels formed by the selfassembly of ABA triblock copolymers in an ionic liquid, {{and find ways to}} enhance the properties of the gels, in order to formulate optimal designs in terms of the triblock for applications to electrochemical devices. Two particular target applications are organic transistors and electrochemical capacitors, due to the very large specific capacitance (on the order of F/cm 2) of these electrolytes and therefore low voltage operation and potentially desirable energy storage. To study the effect of the BCP on the properties of ion gels, BCPs with different midblocks and end-block lengths were prepared, and the viscoelastic and electrical properties of the ion gels were investigated over large composition and temperature ranges. The gels were formed by the self-assembly of poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate-b-styrene) (SMS) and poly(styrene-b-ethylene oxide-b-styrene) (SOS) in the ionic liquid 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) amide ([EMI][TFSA]). The end-blocks associate into cross-links, while the midblocks are well-solvated by this ionic liquid. In terms of viscoelastic properties, {{it was found that the}} plateau modulus of the gels depends primarily on concentration and the molecular weight of the mid-block, while high temperature behavior is controlled by the length of the end-blocks. A body-centered cubic (BCC) structure was observed at elevated temperatures only for gels with short end-blocks due to end-block pull-out from the cross-linking cores, while the relaxation of the end-blocks are within the cores for gels with long end-blocks. In terms of electrical properties, the double-layer capacitance of the gels was found to be fairly insensitive to polymer content and identity, whereas the ionic conductivity varies significantly especially at polymer concentrations of more than 20 wt%. It was also found that the presence of the end-blocks primarily obstructs the ion paths without much effect on ion number density. In terms of materials design, a flexible, low molecular weight mid-block is desirable. Generally, there is a trade-off between ionic conductivity and shear modulus for this type of gels. To enhance the mechanical properties of the gels, a novel ion gel based on poly[(styrene-r-vinylbenzyl azide) -b-ethylene oxide-b-(styrene-r-vinylbenzyl azide) ] (SOS-N 3) with chemically cross-linkable end-blocks was prepared. The gel with 10 wt% polymer goes through two transitions as temperature increases: solid (physically crosslinked network) [...] > liquid [...] > <b>solid</b> (chemically <b>cross-linked</b> network). The modulus and ionic conductivity was found to remain fairly constant after chemical cross-linking, while the toughness is more than 8 times higher. This demonstrates a promising approach to improve the mechanical properties of a moderately dilute gel without interfering with the high ionic conductivity. Overall, BCP-based ion gels are promising SPEs for transistor and capacitor applications. Through judicious selection of the triblocks, the properties of the gels can be tuned to fulfill different requirements...|$|R
40|$|Thin {{structures}} {{exhibit a}} broad range of mechanical responses as the competition between stretching and bending in these structures can result in buckling and localized deformations like folding and tension wrinkling. Active materials also exhibit {{a broad range}} of mechanical responses as features that manifest themselves at the microscale in these materials result in mechanical couplings at the engineering scale (thermal/electrical/dissipative) and novel function (e. g., the shape memory effect and piezoelectricity in select metal alloys and the immense fracture toughness of hydrogels). Given this richness in behaviors, my research broadly aims to address the following questions: What happens when active materials are incorporated into thin structures? Do phenomena inherent to these materials compete with or enhance those inherent to thin structures? Does this interplay result in entirely new and unexpected phenomena? And can all this be exploited to design new functions in engineering systems? In this thesis, we explore these questions {{in the context of a}} theoretical study of thin sheets of nematic liquid crystal elastomer. These materials are active rubbery <b>solids</b> made of <b>cross-linked</b> polymer chains that have liquid crystals either incorporated into the main chain or pendent from them. Their structure enables a coupling between the mechanical elasticity of the polymer network and the ordering of the liquid crystals, and this in turn results in fairly complex mechanical behavior including large spontaneous distortion due to temperature change, soft-elasticity and fine-scale microstructure. We study thin sheets of nematic elastomer. First, we show that thin of sheets of a particular class of nematic elastomer can resist wrinkling when stretched. Second, we show that thin sheets of another class of nematic elastomer can be actuated into a multitude of complex shapes. In order to obtain these results, we systematically develop two dimensional theories for thin sheets starting from a well-accepted first principles theory for nematic elastomers. These characterize (i) the mechanical response due to instabilities such as structural wrinkling and fine-scale material microstructure, and (ii) thermal actuation of heterogeneously patterned sheets. For the latter, we show that the theory, which comes in the form of a two dimensional metric constraint, admits two broad classes of designable actuation in nonisometric origami and lifted surface. For the former, we show that taut and appreciably stressed sheets of nematic elastomer are capable of suppressing wrinkling by modifying the expected state of stress through the formation of microstructure. </p...|$|R
40|$|Conjugated {{polymers}} (CPs), {{also known}} as conducting polymers are polymers consisting of alternating single/double bonds along the polymer backbone. They {{are known to be}} conductive upon doping. One important property of CPs is their ability to undergo reversible redox switch from a neutral (insulting) state to an oxidized (conducting) state upon potential application. Induced by electrical stimuli, accompanied with the change in electronic state of the material is usually a distinguishable change in the materials absorption characteristics within the visible region (400 – 800 nm) or near IR region, resulting in the material’s color change, known as “electrochromism”. In order to have useful Electrochromic applications, conducting polymers should be built into electrochomic devices (ECDs). We have developed a novel processing technique of conjugated polymers for large area electrochromic device manufacturing. Compared with conventional device fabrication process, this novel approach, termed “in situ assembly”, eliminates the solution step, has resulted in less waste, versatility in device manufacturing, the ability for open atmosphere fabrication, and shorter device assembly time by direct conversion of monomers in a <b>cross-linked</b> <b>solid</b> polyelectrolyte matrix after device construction. This dissertation is focused on conducting polymers and electrochromic devices (ECDs) assembled from “in situ” method and divided into two corresponding main parts. PART I (Chapter 3 and Chapter 5) is focused on the development of gel polymer electrolyte materials for supporting the maximum functioning of electrochromic devices prepared from the “in situ” approach. Chapter 3 : a study on varying salts and their composition used in the gel polymer electrolyte for “in situ” assembly for electrochromic devices was carried out to explore their effects on various electrochromic performance parameters, such as color uniformity, photopic contrast, switching speed, and optical memory. It was found that the lithium salts yielded devices with the best color uniformity, photopic contrast as high as 48 %, and switching response speeds as low as 1 s. Hermetically sealed electrochromic devices exhibited optical memory of 27 h for a 2 % photopic transmittance loss under normal laboratory conditions. In Chapter 5, novel flexible gel polymeric electrolyte (GPE) materials were formulated and optimized. Electrolyte composition parameters were fully investigated and studied to maximize the performance of ECDs fabricated via the in situ method. An optimal polyelectrolyte demonstrated a high ionic conductivity of 1. 36 × 10 - 3 S/cm and yielded ECDs with a photopic contrast as high as 53 % with less than 6 % photopic contrast loss after 2000 switching cycles. More importantly, a systematic study was carried out on the mechanical flexibility properties of the gel electrolytes side by side with an evaluation of commercially available indium doped tin oxide (ITO) coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates. Optimized GPEs were found to withstand a much larger bending extent, exceeding that of ITO coated PET, ensuring that ECDs will function still under extreme stresses even if the substrate becomes damaged. PART II (Chapter 4 and Chapter 6) is the discovery of optimal color tuning methods to achieve a desired electrochromic device color. In Chapter 4, demonstrates the ability to achieve neutral color ECDs by adding a commercially available yellow dye into the gel polymer electrolyte utilizing the “in situ” device fabrication approach. The conjugated dye was shown to not interfere with the electropolymerization of our chosen monomer 3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), allowing a combinatorial effect in the subtractive color spectrum. Optimized polymer and yellow dye absorption intensities yielded neutral grey color ECDs with 30 % photopic contrast and switch speeds as low as 1 second on flexible PET substrates. In addition, this study opens up new directions to tune optical and colorimetric properties of other EC polymers in combination with the use of commercially available dyes for increased contrast. Chapter 6 introduces a method to neutral color-tune flexible electrochromic devices using the “in situ” approach, where three monomers (1, 3 -di-tert-butyl- 3, 4 -propylenedioxythiophene, 2, 2 -dimethyl- 3, 4 propylenedioxythiophene, and thieno[3, 4 - b]thio-phene) were used to form two distinct copolymers. The monomer ratios for the conjugated random copolymers were predetermined and optimized via theoretical calculations to provide the most desirable optical properties when combined within an electrochromic device. The demonstration of color tuning based on determining feed ratios using two distinct complimentary copolymer systems consisting of only 3 monomers in a single electrochromic layer solid state device achieved excellent neutrality (2 %) to date. And of note, this most neutral colored electrochromic device in the literature also demonstrated a highest reported photopic contrast of a neutral colored electrochromic device ca. 38 %...|$|R
