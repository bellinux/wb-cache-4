25|$|In 1889 {{the boom}} burst. Three Turin banks, heavily {{involved}} in financing <b>speculative</b> <b>building</b> in Rome, suspended payments. The note issuing banks were persuaded {{by the government to}} bail out other banks in order to avoid a major disaster. They were allowed to issue bank notes in excess of their reserves and legal limits in an attempt to steer clear of economic recession. However, this caused them to become entangled in the crisis.|$|E
25|$|A spur {{connecting}} the North London Railway at Dalston to Stratford, forming {{a part of}} the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway, opened in 1847 for the carriage of coal. This resulted in Hackney Brook being placed in a culvert and the loss of the extensive watercress fields to the south of Homerton High Street. Its later development as a passenger line led to the redevelopment in the 1880s of the mediaeval core of the village on Homerton High Street with Victorian dwellings and public houses, and <b>speculative</b> <b>building</b> on the lands either side of Homerton High Street. In 1868 Homerton Station opened.|$|E

2500|$|The {{so-called}} [...] "Sack of Palermo" [...] {{is one of}} {{the major}} visible faces of the problem. The term is used to indicate the <b>speculative</b> <b>building</b> practices that have filled the city with poor buildings, mainly during the 1950s to the 1980s. The reduced importance of agriculture in the Sicilian economy has led to a massive migration to the cities, especially Palermo, which swelled in size, leading to rapid expansion towards the north. The regulatory plans for expansion was largely ignored in the boom. New parts of town appeared almost out of nowhere, but without parks, schools, public buildings, proper roads and the other amenities that characterise a modern city.|$|E

[...] When {{the houses were}} not too big, then they were almost invariably the product of <b>speculative</b> <b>building,</b> of that multitudinous hasty building for the extravagant multitude of new births that was the essential disaster of the nineteenth century. The new houses Ann refused as damp, and even the youngest of these {{that had been in}} use showed remarkable signs of a sickly constitution, the plaster flaked away, the floors gaped, the paper mouldered and peeled, the doors dropped, the bricks scaled and the railings rusted, Nature in the form of spiders, earwigs, cockroaches, mice, rats, fungi and remarkable smells, was already fighting her way back....|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{how different}} office space layouts affect the predicted {{heating and cooling}} energy demands in <b>speculative</b> office <b>buildings.</b> The discussion is based on energy simulations of a case study office floor plan layout situated in London. Significant variations in predicted energy demands were found. Examining the free-float inside air temperature profiles led {{to the conclusion that}} the thermal behaviour of each zone is mainly influenced by the relationships between different combinations of floor area, window area and internal gains. This means that different ways of describing the building other than its zoning are necessary to assess the potential ranges of thermal behaviour in <b>speculative</b> office <b>buildings...</b>|$|R

50|$|Historically, Blackgang was a hamlet that {{expanded}} {{into a small}} village in the mid 19th century, partly out of a Victorian fashion for <b>speculative</b> <b>building</b> of marine villas, and partly {{in association with the}} establishment of the amusement park at the chine, the large coastal ravine (historically known for being a haunt of smugglers) after which the park was named. The nearby Sandrock Spring, a chalybeate spring discovered in 1811, was another visitor attraction.|$|E

[...] About 1890 Judson hired True, at that point a newly {{established}} architect. The same year, True planned his first row houses on the West Side of New York City. In 1891 he designed buildings at 157 and 159 West 88th Street, the low stoop row houses were each constructed for US$12,000 a piece.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} how {{variations in the}} estimation of internal gains due to usage affect the cooling demands of <b>speculative</b> office <b>buildings.</b> The imprecise information available on these gains {{at the design stage}} has a large effect on the predicted energy demands of these buildings, which are being built to much higher energy performance criteria. This means in practice that designers of <b>speculative</b> office <b>buildings</b> are going to struggle to meet operational energy consumption targets unless they fully understand the implications of the choice of the internal gain strategy they use to account for the potential internal loads due to occupancy. The study compares and contrasts 3 different strategies suggested by the literature to assign these internal gains to offices and is applied in a UK case study office building. The focus of the analysis is the impact of the magnitude of these gains in the cooling demand to be met by the building services not the cooling energy consumption of these services...|$|R
50|$|The Guaranty {{was never}} meant to be the Guaranty Building. It was the brainchild of a Buffalonian {{businessman}} Hascal T. Taylor to construct a <b>speculative</b> office <b>building</b> in the developing downtown district called “The Taylor Building.” The untimely demise of Mr. Taylor as the project was reaching its apogee resulted in the Guaranty Construction Company, having been contracted to construct the structure, determining to take on the project alone. Although “The entrepreneur Hascal T. Taylor intended this building to be a monument to himself,” the eventual monument would symbolize Sullivan’s achievements much more than its creators. The site Taylor chose for his <b>speculative</b> office <b>building</b> was strategically located adjacent to the then County and City Municipal building as well as near a number of institutional structures. The intention was to attract high quality tenants such as lawyers through proximity, desirable amenities and the captivating design of an avant garde architect like Sullivan.|$|R
50|$|Architect and {{developer}} John C.

50|$|Hall {{got into}} <b>speculative</b> <b>building</b> in the East Bay {{on a large}} scale {{following}} the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which created an exodus of people looking for new homes outside the city itself. Between 1906 and 1912 she concentrated on the Elmwood district of Berkeley, an area that was then just beginning to be developed. Hall built many of the homes along College Avenue and on nearby streets that are now often taken as Berkeley's signature style: one- and two-story brown-shingled buildings with wide eaves and exposed beams.|$|E

50|$|The design {{consists}} of two glass and metal ‘boxes’ that appear to jut out of the main building, while the building facade {{consists of}} a glass and aluminium cladding to present a strong urban form and distinctive character. The city centre location of the 1 New York Street site presented a number of challenges due to adjacent tram lines in the road and tunnels underneath the building. To minimise disturbance to both the tram lines and the surrounding area, the existing basement structure {{has been used in}} conjunction with new pile foundations. 1 New York Street is the first <b>speculative</b> <b>building</b> in central Manchester to be awarded a BREEAM ‘excellent’ rating.|$|E
50|$|The prison {{industry}} {{declined in}} the late 20th century, as the crime rate was decreasing nationally and privatization was under attack by critics and legislators.
