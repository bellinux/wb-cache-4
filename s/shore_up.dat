5|$|Dissatisfied {{that the}} General Assembly had not acted to <b>shore</b> <b>up</b> the state pension system, Beshear called a special {{legislative}} session for July 23, 2008, after House and Senate leaders {{informed him that}} they had reached an agreement on a plan after the regular legislative session's end. The session lasted five days, the minimum amount of time required to maneuver the bill through the legislative process.|$|E
5|$|Major {{repair work}} was done in 2003 and 2006, when the Victorian {{drainage}} culvert was replaced and the track lowered to allow access for larger passenger and freight stock {{at a cost of}} £10million. The 16 closed airshafts were deteriorating and had to be re-capped. In 2003 the excavated material from the works was recycled to <b>shore</b> <b>up</b> the railway embankment near Castley.|$|E
5|$|Patton {{had risen}} to {{national}} prominence, successively chairing the Southern Governors Association, the Democratic Governors Association, and the National Governors Association (NGA). He was serving as NGA chair {{at the time the}} Tina Conner scandal broke, and planned to resign his chairmanship in November 2002. Nevertheless, the other governors rallied around him, convincing him to remain in the position. Together with his Republican vice-chair, Idaho's Dirk Kempthorne, Patton led the NGA effectively, securing federal funding to <b>shore</b> <b>up</b> state budgets and keeping the caucus from a partisan split in a vote over Medicaid.|$|E

5|$|The {{objective}} of the campaign was {{the defeat of the}} approximately 40,000 troops of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF, also known as Viet Cong) in the eastern border regions of Cambodia. Cambodian neutrality and military weakness made its territory a safe zone where Vietnamese communist forces could establish bases for operations over the border. With the US shifting toward a policy of Vietnamization and withdrawal, it sought to <b>shore</b> <b>up</b> the South Vietnamese government by eliminating the cross-border threat.|$|E
5|$|Balmer was {{promoted}} to temporary group captain on 4May 1944. On 10/11May, his Lancasters {{took part in a}} raid on Lille, losing three of their number. In an effort to <b>shore</b> <b>up</b> the morale of his younger crews, Balmer decided to personally lead their next mission the following night, against a military camp at Bourg-Léopold (Leopoldsburg), Belgium. It was planned to be his last operation before going on to a more senior position. His aircraft failed to return from the raid, causing considerable shock to his unit. The next day, Balmer's place as commanding officer of No.467 Squadron was taken by Wing Commander William Brill, previously a member of No.463 Squadron RAAF, which was also based at Waddington.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, an {{overpass}} {{being built}} at MD198 over the B–W Parkway {{just east of}} Laurel collapsed during rush hour, injuring fourteen motorists and construction workers. The incident was blamed on faulty scaffolding used to support the uncompleted span. On July 9, 2005, a sinkhole opened beneath the parkway at a construction site, leading to the complete closure of the northbound roadway. The sinkhole was filled with concrete to <b>shore</b> <b>up</b> the roadbed and prevent further collapse; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers attempted to expedite repairs, but the route remained closed until the next day. On August 24, 2007, both directions of the parkway were closed when chunks of concrete fell from the overpass at MD193 (Greenbelt Road) onto the northbound lanes.|$|E

5|$|In North Africa, Rhodesians in the 11th Hussars, 2nd Leicesters, 1st Cheshires {{and other}} regiments contributed to Operation Compass between December 1940 and February 1941 {{as part of}} the Western Desert Force under Major-General Richard O'Connor, {{fighting}} at Sidi Barrani, Bardia, Beda Fomm and elsewhere. This offensive was extremely successful, with the Allies suffering very few casualties—around 700 killed and 2,300 wounded and missing—while capturing the strategic port Tobruk, over 100,000 Italian soldiers and most of Cyrenaica. The Germans reacted by despatching the Afrika Korps under Erwin Rommel to <b>shore</b> <b>up</b> the Italian forces. Rommel led a strong counter-offensive in March–April 1941 that forced a general Allied withdrawal towards Egypt. German and Italian forces surrounded Tobruk but failed to take the largely Australian-garrisoned city, leading to the lengthy Siege of Tobruk.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to purges, banishments and censorship, Rosas took measures against {{the opposition and}} anyone else he deemed a threat that historians have considered state terrorism. Terror was a tool used to intimidate dissident voices, to <b>shore</b> <b>up</b> support among his own partisans and to exterminate his foes. His targets were denounced, sometimes inaccurately, as having ties to Unitarians. Those victimised included members of his government and party who were suspected of being insufficiently loyal. If actual opponents were not at hand, the regime found other targets that were punished to make an example. A climate of fear was used to create unquestioning conformity to Rosas' dictates.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to President Ngo Dinh Diem's abrogation of the 1956 reunification election and suppression of communists {{during the late}} 1950s, Hanoi had begun sending arms and material to the guerrillas of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF), who were fighting an insurgency to topple the American-supported Saigon government. To combat the NLF and to <b>shore</b> <b>up</b> {{the government in the}} south, the U.S. initially delivered monetary aid, military advisors, and supplies. Between 1957 and 1963, the U.S. found itself committed, through its acceptance of the policy of containment and belief in the domino theory, to defending South Vietnam from what it saw as expansive communist aggression.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to its losses, UBS announced a CHF 15billion rights offering {{to raise the}} additional funds need to <b>shore</b> <b>up</b> its depleted reserves of capital. UBS cut its dividend {{in order to protect}} its traditionally high Tier 1 capital ratio, seen by investors as a key to its credibility as the world's largest wealth management company. Marcel Ospel, who had been the architect of the merger that created UBS in 1998, also announced that he would step down as a chairman of the bank to be replaced by Peter Kurer, the bank's general counsel with virtually no banking experience. This ultimately proved very costly to UBS.|$|E
5|$|It was John's {{hope that}} the Pope would give him {{valuable}} legal and moral support, and accordingly John played for time; the King had declared {{himself to be a}} papal vassal in 1213 and correctly believed he could count on the Pope for help. John also began recruiting mercenary forces from France, although some were later sent back to avoid giving the impression that the King was escalating the conflict. In a further move to <b>shore</b> <b>up</b> his support, John took an oath to become a crusader, a move which gave him additional political protection under church law, even though many felt the promise was insincere.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1993 season, the Jets {{obtained}} Bengals quarterback Boomer Esiason, who {{had worked}} with Coslet in Cincinnati. Steinberg signed veteran safety Ronnie Lott to <b>shore</b> <b>up</b> the defense. O'Brien's career with the Jets ended with an offseason trade to the Green Bay Packers, and running back Freeman McNeil retired after twelve seasons. The Jets suffered another December collapse: they lost four of their last five to finish 8–8. The Jets would have made the playoffs by winning their last game, but were shut out at the Astrodome by the Oilers. Following the season, Steinberg fired Coslet and replaced him with defensive coordinator Pete Carroll.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the hurricane, many {{residents}} in shanty towns failed to hear tropical cyclone warnings and watches. Some did hear the warnings, but they did not believe them as the same warning had been issued several weeks before and nothing had happened. In addition, city officials warned the residents living near the dam to take shelter in public buildings though most refused to leave. The government ignored all requests to <b>shore</b> <b>up</b> an earthen dam, as they did not believe Liza would pose a significant threat of damage to the Baja California Peninsula. Along the Gulf Coast, troops evacuated residents, and radio stations warned all nearby ships to remain at harbor. During the afternoon hours of September29, the education department suspended classes as it began to rain.|$|E
5|$|The Germans responded {{quickly by}} redeploying their only reserve in the area, the 29th Panzergrenadier Division. Despite initial {{victories}} against Soviet armored forces, the Romanian collapse forced the division to again redeploy {{in an attempt}} to <b>shore</b> <b>up</b> defenses to the south. The 29th Panzergrenadier Division's counterattack had cost the Red Army around fifty tanks, and caused Soviet commanders to worry about the safety of their left flank. However, the German division's redeployment meant {{that by the end of}} the day only the 6th Romanian Cavalry Regiment was positioned between advancing Soviet forces and the Don River.|$|E
5|$|The arch {{was built}} {{as part of}} the Temple Mount's massive western {{retaining}} wall, which forms its eastern support. The voussoirs spring from a row of impost blocks which were cut to produce a dentil pattern. There have been some theories which speculate that the dentils were employed as part of a system used to <b>shore</b> <b>up</b> timber forms used during construction. However, this was a common decorative element employed in the region at the time, and archaeologists have noted that in this region of limited forests it is much more likely that packed earth, rather than expensive timbers, was used to support the form on which the arch was constructed.|$|E

5|$|The attacks caught UN {{planners}} and troops by surprise. By August 26, the UN troops {{thought they had}} destroyed the last serious threats to the perimeter, and anticipated the war ending by late November. ROK units, in the meantime, suffered from low morale {{as a result of}} their failures to defend effectively thus far in the conflict, and a cautious US Eighth Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker ordered Major General John B. Coulter to the P'ohang-dong area to <b>shore</b> <b>up</b> the ROK I Corps, which was falling apart due to low morale. UN troops were preparing for Operation Chromite, an amphibious assault on the port of Inchon on September 15, and did not anticipate that the North Koreans would mount a serious offensive before then.|$|E
5|$|The {{decisive factor}} {{in favour of}} change in Chicago, however, was the {{economic}} slowdown in the early 1890s, which {{gave way to the}} financial panic of 1893. The recession, combined with the frantic building of the previous few years, meant that Chicago suddenly had a significant surplus of office space, threatening occupancy levels and rents. Regulation was introduced by the city council to control the problem in 1892, with support from the real estate industry who hoped to slow the construction of additional office space and <b>shore</b> <b>up</b> their diminishing profit margins. The height of new buildings was limited to , with lower height levels on narrower streets, effectively curtailing the construction of any taller skyscrapers.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Muslim Civil War in 656 bought a precious breathing pause for Byzantium, which Emperor Constans II (r. 641–668) used to <b>shore</b> <b>up</b> his defences, extend and consolidate his control over Armenia and most importantly, initiate a major army reform with lasting effect: {{the establishment of the}} themata, the large territorial commands into which Anatolia, the major contiguous territory remaining to the Empire, was divided. The remains of the old field armies were settled in each of them, and soldiers were allocated land there in payment of their service. The themata would form the backbone of the Byzantine defensive system for centuries to come.|$|E
