5|$|Cory {{served as}} the film's main director, as he had more {{experience}} with animation, comedy, and children's entertainment, while Todd served as co-director. Montgomery and Stutzman were joined by Disney animation veteran David Lovegren as producers on the film, and Cory's and Todd's sister Katie Hooten joined as an associate producer. Tony Leech, {{who had worked with}} the Edwards brothers on Chillicothe, was initially hired as an editor, but gained story input as well. He eventually proved to be <b>so</b> <b>valuable</b> to the production that he was given a role as co-director.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 English and Welsh breeders {{established}} a breeders' association, the Welsh Pony and Cob Society, {{and the first}} stud book was published in 1902. It was decided that the Welsh Stud Book should be separated into sections divided by type and height. Welsh Ponies were originally only classified as Section A, but in 1931, with the rising demand for riding ponies for children, Section B was added. In the first stud books, the Section B was the Welsh Pony of Cob Type, and the Welsh Cob was Section C and Section D. The upper height limit for Section D Cobs was removed in 1907 and in 1931 Sections C and D were combined as simply Section C. The current standards of Cobs as Sections C and D were finalised in 1949. Until the mid 20th century, the British War Office considered the Welsh Cob <b>so</b> <b>valuable</b> that they paid premiums to the best stallions. After World War II, only three stallions were registered in Section C, but numbers have since recovered.|$|E

25|$|An {{absolute}} pacifist {{is generally}} {{described by the}} British Broadcasting Corporation as one who believes that human life is <b>so</b> <b>valuable,</b> that a human should never be killed and war should never be conducted, even in self-defense. The principle is described as difficult to abide by consistently, due to violence not being available {{as a tool to}} aid a person who is being harmed or killed. It is further claimed that such a pacifist could logically argue that violence leads to more undesirable results than non-violence.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle's unit gained {{recognition}} for repeatedly crawling out into no man's land {{to listen to}} the conversations of the enemy in their trenches, and the information he brought back was <b>so</b> <b>valuable</b> that on 18 January 1915 he received the Croix de Guerre. On 10 February he was promoted to captain, initially on probation. On 10 March 1915, de Gaulle received a bullet in the left hand, which initially seemed trivial but became infected. The wound incapacitated him for four months and later forced him to wear his wedding ring on the right hand. In August he commanded the 10th company before returning to duty as regimental adjutant. On 3 September 1915 his rank of captain became permanent. In late October, returning from leave, he returned to command of 10th company again.|$|E
25|$|Bach's {{mother died}} in 1694, and his father died eight months later. The 10-year-old Bach moved in with his eldest brother, Johann Christoph Bach (1671–1721), the organist at St.Michael's Church in Ohrdruf, Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. There he studied, performed, and copied music, {{including}} his own brother's, despite being forbidden to do so because scores were <b>so</b> <b>valuable</b> and private and blank ledger paper of that type was costly. He received valuable teaching from his brother, who instructed him on the clavichord. J.C.Bach exposed him to the works of great composers of the day, including South German composers such as Johann Pachelbel (under whom Johann Christoph had studied) and Johann Jakob Froberger; North German composers; Frenchmen, such as Jean-Baptiste Lully, Louis Marchand, and Marin Marais; and the Italian clavierist Girolamo Frescobaldi. Also during this time, he was taught theology, Latin, Greek, French, and Italian at the local gymnasium.|$|E

500|$|The {{value of}} horses {{was known to}} all. In 1917 at the Battle of Passchendaele, men at the front {{understood}} that [...] "at this stage to lose a horse was worse than losing a man because after all, men were replaceable while horses weren't." [...] For Britain, horses were considered <b>so</b> <b>valuable</b> that if a soldier's horse was killed or died he was required to cut off a hoof {{and bring it back}} to his commanding officer to prove that the two had not simply become separated.|$|E
500|$|Sveinn asked Haraldr {{which of}} his {{possessions}} of his he valued most highly. He answered {{that it was}} his banner (merki), Landøyðan. Thereupon Sveinn asked what virtue it had to be accounted <b>so</b> <b>valuable.</b> Haraldr replied that it was prophesied that victory would be his before whom this banner was borne; and added that this had been the case ever since he had obtained it. Thereupon Sveinn said, [...] "I shall believe that your flag has this virtue if you fight three battles with King Magnús, your kinsman, and are victorious in all." ...|$|E

500|$|When the Department of Labor reissued federal {{guidelines}} in April 2010 governing {{the employment of}} unpaid interns under the Fair Labor Standards Act based on a 1947 Supreme Court decision, Stossel criticized the guidelines, appearing in a police uniform during an appearance on the Fox News program America Live, commenting, [...] "I’ve built my career on unpaid interns, and the interns {{told me it was}} great– I learned more from you than I did in college."

500|$|Compared {{with how}} {{important}} religious practice was in Mesopotamia, and {{compared to the}} number of temples that existed, very few cult figures at all have been preserved. This is certainly not {{due to a lack of}} artistic skill: the [...] "Ram in a Thicket" [...] (see image below) shows how elaborate such sculptures could have been, even 600 to 800 years earlier. It is also not due to a lack of interest in religious sculpture: deities and myths are ubiquitous on cylinder seals and the few steles, kudurrus, and reliefs that have been preserved. Rather, it seems plausible that the main figures of worship in temples and shrines were made of materials <b>so</b> <b>valuable</b> they could not escape looting during the many shifts of power that the region saw. The Burney Relief is comparatively plain, and so survived. In fact, the relief is one of only two existing large, figurative representations from the Old Babylonian period. The other one is the top part of the Code of Hammurabi, which was actually discovered in Elamite Susa, where it had been brought as booty (see image).|$|E

2500|$|Because {{platinum}} was <b>so</b> <b>valuable,</b> even {{in small}} amounts, and Axis agents {{were willing to}} pay premium prices, smuggling became a problem. Accordingly, Colombia attempted to control the export of platinum by requiring all producers to sell their product to the Central Bank only. However, producers in remote areas were able to circumvent government control by selling their product on the black market in Argentina. The smuggling of platinum out of Colombia remained a problem for most of the war, but it was reduced to a [...] "trickle" [...] by late 1944.|$|E
2500|$|Colonists and {{settlers}} valued cast-iron cookware {{because of}} its versatility and durability. Cooks used them to boil, bake, stew, fry, and roast. The ovens were <b>so</b> <b>valuable</b> that wills in the 18th and 19th centuries frequently spelled out the desired inheritor. For example, Mary Ball Washington (mother of President George Washington) specified in her will, dated 20 May 1788, that one-half of her [...] "iron kitchen furniture" [...] should go to her grandson, Fielding Lewis, {{and the other half}} to Betty Carter, a granddaughter. This bequest included several Dutch ovens.|$|E

ISIS has also kidnapped foreign-aid workers and Syrians who work for foreign-funded groups and {{reconstruction}} projects in Syria. [...] By mid-2014, ISIS was holding assets valued at US$2 billion, which made it the world's wealthiest Islamist group.|$|E
