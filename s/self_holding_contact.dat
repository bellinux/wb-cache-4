The only exception is that such unfavourable situations can be simulated to remove a jammed shank. Permitting chatter will help release the grip. The acute (narrow) taper angle can result in such jamming with heavy axial loads, or over long periods.|$|R

5000|$|NMTB is a [...] "self releasing" [...] or [...] "fast" [...] taper. Unlike {{the more}} acute <b>self</b> <b>holding</b> tapers above, such tapers are not {{designed}} to transmit high torque; high torques are carried by driving keys engaging slots on the flange. The purpose is to allow a quick and easy change between different tools (either automatically or by hand) while ensuring the tool or toolholder will be tightly and rigidly connected to the spindle, and accurately coaxial with it. The larger end adjacent to the tool makes for more rigidity than is possible with Morse or RT tapers fitted to comparable machines.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Rehabilitative {{follow-up}} care {{is important}} for stroke patients to regain their motor and cognitive skills. We aim to develop a robotic rehabilitation assistant for walking exercises in late stages of rehabilitation. The robotic rehab assistant is to accompany inpatients during their self-training, practicing both mobility and spatial orientation skills. To <b>hold</b> <b>contact</b> to the patient, even after temporally full occlusions, robust user re-identification is essential. Therefore, we imple-mented a person re-identification module that continuously re-identifies the patient, using only few amount of the robot’s processing resources. It is robust to varying illumination and occlusions. State-of-the-art performance is confirmed on a standard benchmark dataset, {{as well as on}} a recorded scenario-specific dataset. Additionally, the benefit of using a visual re-identification component is verified by live-tests with the robot in a stroke rehab clinic. I...|$|R

"It is {{now known}} that the {{conscious}} mind is but a pin's-point of the mind's activity, the conscious state being but one of {{an infinite number of}} possible states--that the submerged, unconscious self is a million times more complex than the chain of those conscious states which makes up the normal or orderly life of an individual.

This submerged <b>self,</b> <b>holding,</b> as it does, all the experiences of the dark past, all the lusts, deceits, and subterfuges, all the cruelties and shameless potentialities of her animal and semicivilized forebears, and being but a mass of discordant impulses--states almost entirely disassociated from her conscious life--has all but taken possession of her higher self. The restraint of the later-developed, governing, moral self being weakened, the witches and wolves are leaping forth to vex and destroy.

40|$|Chapter 1 : This chapter {{examines}} the logical {{consequences of the}} rather unsur-prising notion that humans care about and manage their self-image, a notion long taken for granted by psychologists. I model this by assuming that decisionmakers derive utility from positive views about the <b>self,</b> <b>holding</b> constant standard utilitarian outcomes usually assumed relevant in economics. Other than this, agents are time-consistent expected utility maximizers, are constrained in their updating by Bayes' rule, and can manipulate their beliefs only by controlling {{the flow of information}} that they receive. The motive to maintain a favorable self-image leads to a systematic re-jection of free information about the self in certain states of the world and eventually to overconfident beliefs. Economically relevant decisions are affected by this overcon-fidence as well as the incentive to gather information about and make decisions so as to optimally manage beliefs. Agents might avoid informative actions when satisfied with their current beliefs ('self-image protection'), and seek out activities in which they can prove themselves when they are not ('self-image enhancement'), even if thes...|$|R
40|$|Summary - The aim of {{the present}} study is to explore themes related to music therapy, {{children}} and young people and mental health. A qualitative, hermeneutic-phenomenological approach and semi-structured interviews with four music therapists, seeks to answer the research question What kind of position does self-esteem and sense of <b>self</b> <b>hold</b> in music therapy practice promoting childrens and young people´s mental health? The procedure chosen for the analysis is Interpretativ Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The results of the analysis shows that self-esteem and a sense of self can relate to music therapy, children and young people's mental helath in three main categories; Identity, Music therapy practice and Selfesteem/ sense of self, and seven ground categories: a place to feel free, mastery, social aspects, relationship, goals and working methods, change and coping. From a salutogenetic point of view, these categories have been discussed up against theories mostly from the field of music therapy and developmental psychology. - - Keywords: Self-esteem, sense of self, self-agency, mental health, children, adolescents, young people, music therapy, music...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} how {{the pattern of}} contacts between species in mutualistic ecosystems {{is affected by the}} phylogenetic proximity between the species of each guild. We develop several theoretical tools to measure that effect and we use them to examine some real mutualistic sytems. We aim at establishing the role of such proximity in the emergence of a nested pattern of contacts. We conclude that although phylogenetic proximity is compatible with nestedness it can not be claimed to determine it. We find that nestedness can instead be attributed to a general rule by which species tend to behave as generalists <b>holding</b> <b>contacts</b> with counterparts that already have a large number of contacts. A nested ecosystem generated by this rule, shows high phylogenetic diversity. This is to say, the counterparts of species having similar degrees are not phylogenetic neighbours.

The cytokines thus released in a paracrine manner in serum may also provide an indirect measure of the cytokine function. The present study was aimed to evaluate the levels of TNF-α, IL- 10 & IL- 6 cytokines and their correlation with genotype variants amongst tuberculosis patients and their household contacts. The cytokine levels were estimated in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and their polymorphisms were studied by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMs PCR) in active pulmonary tuberculosis patients (APTB = 150), household contacts (HHC = 190), and healthy controls (HC = 150). The median values of TNF-α cytokine were significantly high among APTB and HHC compared to HCs (P< 0. 0001 and 0. 0001). IL- 6 levels also were elevated among APTB compared to HHC and HC, and a significant difference was observed between APTB and HHC at P< 0. 0001; APTB & HC at P< 0. 04; HHC & HC at P< 0. 01. The IL- 10 levels were low in APTB compared to HHC and HCs and no significant difference was observed. TNF-α/IL- 10 ratio was significant and indicated Th 1 predominance in APTB and HHC. IL- 6 /IL- 10 showed pronounced Th 1 expression in APTB and Th 2 in HHC and HC. The ROC analysis indicated that both IL- 10 and IL- 6 {{can be used to}} decide the risk of exposed individual to a disease. The results of multivariate analysis indicate that IL- 10 (- 1082) GA genotype was significantly associated with p< 0. 028 in APTB. No significant association was observed between genotypes, other serum cytokine levels and clinical characteristics between APTB, HHC and HCs.
