40|$|The {{actions of}} {{diazepam}} and droperidol were studied on the spontaneously active and oxytocin-treated oestrus rat uterus. Both drugs significantly depressed {{the frequency of}} uterine contraction. Droperidol reduced the amplitude of contractions and the basal tone of the tissue. The sensitivity of the tissue to both drugs was enhanced {{in the presence of}} the smallest concentration of oxytocin (0. 2 mu. ml" 1). Prior exposure of the tissue to droperidol sensitized the muscle to oxytocin. The increasing use of recently introduced compounds in obstetric practice, both by anaesthetists and by gynaecologists, has inevitably posed the question of t ie effect these may have on uterine contractility. Diazepam is used clinically in obstetrics and gynae-cology as a sedative and as an anaesthetic induction agent. The butyrophenone, droperidol, is finding increasing favour as a premedicant and anti-emetic. Both these drugs, although chemically dissimilar, have been shown to have significant effects upon smooth muscle (Puddy, 1971; Greene, 1972; Bradshaw, 1978). In this preliminary study the effects of diazepam and droperidol have been examined on the spontaneously active or oxytocin-stimulated, isolated, oestrus rat uterus. METHOD The rat uterus was used in the oestrus condition as this is the stage when the uterus contracts most actively. The stage of the oestrus cycle was deter-mined by the cornification index of the rat's vaginal smear. The rat was killed and each horn of the uterus was divided longitudinally to provide four prepara-tions. These were suspended in Krebs-Henseleit solution, kept at 37 °C and bubbled with 5 % carbon dioxide in oxygen. Each muscle strip was attached to a <b>strain-gauge</b> <b>transducer</b> connected to a Rikadenki pen recorder.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{utility of}} intra-aneurysmal {{pressure}} determination {{is dependent on}} the ability to measure pressure in the presence of endoleak and thrombosis. In this study, the accuracy of a CardioMEMS wireless pressure sensor (CardioMEMS, Atlanta, Ga) transducer in the presence of thrombus associated with type II endoleak was measured. MethodsType II endoleaks were created in four mongrel dogs by implanting four collateral arterial side branches (lumbar and caudal mesenteric arteries) as a Carrel patch onto a 3 -cm prosthetic polytetrafluoroethylene abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The aneurysm was excluded 2 weeks later from antegrade perfusion by a stent graft. The wireless pressure sensor was positioned in the AAA external to the stent graft. A Konigsberg intraluminal solid-state strain-gauge pressure transducer (Konigsberg Instruments, Pasadena, Calif) that is accurate in the presence of thrombus served as the control to determine AAA pressure. Both of the transducers were implanted on the luminal surface of the aneurysm, 180 degrees opposite from the Carrel patch and endoleak channel. Intra-aneurysmal pressure resulting from the type II endoleak was measured twice daily for 4 weeks using both transducers. A total of 56 pre-exclusion and 224 post-exclusion distinct pressure determinations were made. Intra-aneurysmal pressure was indexed to the systemic pressure that was simultaneously measured by a strain-gauge pressure transducer implanted in the native aorta. Histologic analysis of the aneurysm contents was performed with hematoxylin and eosin. ResultsThe intra-aneurysmal systolic, mean, and pulse pressures produced by the type II endoleak were significantly lower than systemic pressure in all animals and were < 60 % of systemic pressure (P <. 001). Close correlation between the wireless transducer and the control <b>strain-gauge</b> <b>transducer</b> was observed (R = 0. 83, P <. 001). Arteriography and Doppler ultrasound documented retrograde flow through the aneurysm side branches and persistent endoleak patency up to the time of euthanasia. Pathologic analysis demonstrated the endoleak channel to be patent and separated from the transducers by thrombus, which surrounded both transducers. ConclusionsIntra-aneurysmal pressure generated by type II endoleaks may be accurately measured through thrombus using a wireless pressure sensor in the canine model. The wireless sensor has the potential for clinical applicability in diagnosing and characterizing type II endoleaks. Clinical RelevanceEndoleaks originating from retrograde flow in the side branch vessels of the aneurysm generate significant pulsatile pressurization of the aneurysm sac. Monitoring pressure by using a wireless sensor in the presence of aneurysm sac thrombus may better define the clinical significance of endoleaks and may become a valuable tool for follow-up after endovascular repair...|$|E
40|$|Intestinal dysmotility and stasis after {{intestinal}} transplantation {{are considered}} to promote bacterial overgrowth and translocation. Two prokinetic agents, KW 5139 (13 -leu-motilin) and the somatostatin analogue octreotide acetate, were studied {{to determine whether they}} can ameliorate intestinal dysmotility during the early postoperative period. Motility was recorded by multiple extraluminal <b>strain-gauge</b> <b>transducers</b> in 6 dogs on postoperative days 1, 3, 7, and 14. A barium meal study was performed with a separate group of 8 dogs on postoperative days 3 and 7. The agent KW 5139 induced brief, weak contractions in the graft and had little effect on the dilated bowel; however, octreotide induced motor activity that propelled accumulated intestinal contents into the colon and reduced dilation of the transplanted bowel. Octreotide, but not KW 5139, ameliorates intestinal dysmotility associated with bowel autotransplantation during the early postoperative period.

The {{purpose of}} this study was to determine by direct measurements of mesenteric hemodynamics whether this effect represents a local pharmacologic action on the mesenteric circulation. Mesenteric blood flow was measured in anesthetized dogs with an electromagnetic blood flowmeter, arterial and portal pressures were measured with <b>strain-gauge</b> <b>transducers</b> and mesenteric vascular resistance was calculated from these measurements. In each experiment ouabain was infused i. a. at progressively in-creasing rates from 5 to 80 jg/min for five-minute periods. At all infusion rates mesenteric blood flow decreased significantly and resistance increased. These responses were elicited even at low doses which did not alter heart rate or arterial or portal pressures. Similar ex-periments were conducted on the common carotid artery of the dog, with similar results; i. a. infusion of ouabain evoked a constrictor response with a decrease in blood flow.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{has been}} developed for the offline analysis of prolonged manometric recordings in the upper small intestine of humans. Sample data are acquired in the human duodenum and jejunum six solid-state <b>strain-gauge</b> <b>transducers</b> mounted on a silicon catheter that is connected to a portable digital recording device. The data are sampled at 4 Hz and filtered. For accurate calculations, the filtered signals are converted to cubic B-spline functions of order four. Based on an exponential weighted moving average, a base-line is calculated from the signal. Contractions are recognised {{on the basis of}} thresholds for minimum amplitude and duration. The developed algorithm calculates properties of these contractions, such as amplitude, duration, area and a motility index. In addition, the program automatically recognises normal motor patterns of the fasted human small intestine, such as the migrating motor complex, and aids in the identification of the postprandial motor pattern. Motor patterns are defined in terms of properties such as contraction frequency and propagation. In a validation procedure using conventional manual analysis, the program correctly identifies the number of individual contractions with a 98 % confidence interval and also correctly recognises 96 % of phase 3 motor activity. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} record 24 hour jejunal {{motility}} in healthy ambulant subjects and to analyse changes in motility {{caused by the}} oral administration of an anticholinergic agent, the quaternary ammonium compound, trospium chloride. In a placebo-controlled, double blind crossover trial, 24 hour jejunal motility was recorded in 12 healthy volunteers, aged 25 (21 - 30) years, using a digital data logger connected to two <b>strain-gauge</b> <b>transducers</b> mounted 20 cm apart in a flexible nasojejunal catheter. A computer program was developed to determine contraction parameters. Trospium chloride (15 mg orally thrice daily) prolonged the duration of irregular contractile activity after meals (p < 0. 02) and reduced its contraction frequency and amplitude (p < 0. 001). In the fasting state, the cycle length of the migrating motor complex was prolonged (p < 0. 01) by an extended phase I (p < 0. 025). Phase III was shortened (p < 0. 005) and showed a slower aboral migration velocity (p < 0. 005). Clustered contractions were less frequent during postprandial and fasting periods (p < 0. 01).

40|$|Rabbits produce {{hard and}} soft faeces in a {{circadian}} rhythm. This study was undertaken {{in order to}} examine the motor function of the colon in relation to the formation of these two types of faeces. Colonic motility was measured in unanaesthetized rabbits using <b>strain-gauge</b> <b>transducers</b> and simultaneous radiography. Three types of contractions were found in the rabbit proximal colon: haustral activity, segmental activity, and mass peristalsis. Distinctly different motor patterns were observed during the formation of hard and soft faeces. When hard faeces were produced, the motor activity of the proximal colon was enhanced. It consisted of segmental and haustral activity. The segmental contractions separated the digesta into faecal pellets and forced them slowly aborad, whereas the movements of the haustra carried the liquid contents back towards the caecum. When soft faeces were produced haustral and segmental activity was reduced and transfer of the digesta through the proximal colon was accelerated by mass movements. In contrast to the proximal colon, the motility of the distal colon was enhanced during the formation of soft faeces and decreased during the production of hard faeces. The results support the concept that hard faeces are chiefly produced by a separation of liquids and solids and by a retrograde transfer of liquid digesta rather than by an increased absorption of water...|$|R

Thus, {{the purposes of this}} study were to determine the mean maximum bite force in individuals with normal occlusion, and to examine the effect of gender, facial dimensions, body mass index (BMI), type of functional occlusion (canine guidance and group function occlusion) and balancing side interferences on it. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-four individuals aged 19 - 20 years-old were selected for this study. Maximum bite force was measured with <b>strain-gauge</b> <b>transducers</b> at first molar region. Facial dimensions were defined by standardized frontal photographs as follows: anterior total facial height (ATFH), bizygomathic facial width (BFW) and intergonial width (IGW). BMI was calculated using the equation weight/height². The type of functional occlusion and the balancing side interferences of the subjects were identified by clinical examination. RESULTS: Bite force was found to be significantly higher in men than women (p 0. 05). BMI and bite force correlation was not statistically significant (p> 0. 05). The average bite force did not differ in subjects with canine guidance or group function occlusion and in the presence of balancing side interferences (p> 0. 05).

This in situ study was conducted to determine the immediate influence of three different occlusal vertical dimensions on the maximum bite force and EMG activities of the masseter and anterior temporalis muscles. Materials and methods: Five healthy subjects participated in the study. Two maxillary occlusal splints of 2 and 4  mm thickness were fabricated, and their use created, respectively, 8 and 10  mm of intermolar distances in the first molar region with a strain-gauge-mounted metal arch. EMG activities of the muscles and the maximum bite force were simultaneously recorded using an EMG device and two miniature <b>strain-gauge</b> <b>transducers.</b> Recordings were made in the first molar region without a splint, but with two splints to produce 6, 8, and 10  mm of intermolar distances. Results: EMG activities of both muscles decreased with increased jaw opening; however, the differences were not statistically significant. The highest maximum bite force was found at a 6 -mm intermolar distance, which significantly differed from those at 8 - and 10 -mm intermolar distances (P <  0. 05). The most efficient bite force was exerted with 6  mm of intermolar distance. The least EMG activity of both muscles was found with 10  mm of intermolar distance.

40|$|Extremely lightweight, compact, noninvasive, rugged, {{relatively}} inexpensive <b>strain-gauge</b> <b>transducers</b> {{have been developed}} for use in measuring pressures of fluids in tubes. These gauges were originally intended for measuring pressures of spacecraft-propulsion fluids, but they are also attractive for use in numerous terrestrial applications especially those involving fluids that are extremely chemically reactive, fluids that must be isolated for hygienic purposes, fluids that must be allowed to flow without obstruction, and fluid-containing tubes exposed to severe environments. A basic pressure transducer of this type comprises one or more pair(s) of thin-film strain gauges integral with a tube that contains the fluid of interest. Following established strain-gauge practice, the gauges in each pair are connected into opposite arms of a Wheatstone bridge (see figure). Typically, each pressure transducer includes one pair (the active pair) of strain gauges for measuring the hoop stress proportional to the pressure of the fluid in the tube and another pair (the dummy pair) of strain gauges that are nominally unstrained: The dummy gauges are mounted on a substrate that is made of the same material as that of the tube. The substrate is welded to the tube at only one spot so that stresses and strains are not coupled from the tube into the substrate. The dummy strain gauges measure neutral strains (basically, strains associated with thermal expansion), so that the neutral-strain contribution can be subtracted out of the final gauge reading...|$|R

The basic pattern of colonic myoelectrical activity was characterized by randomly occurring spike bursts at a higher frequency in the proximal (0. 9 /min) than the distal colon (0. 5 /min). Their duration in the fasted state, which was shorter in the proximal (5. 5 +/- 1. 7 s) than the distal colon (12. 7 +/- 2. 9 s), was similar following a meal. In the fasted state, integrated records showed cyclical periods of more intense electrical activity lasting about 20 and 40 min in the proximal and the distal colon, respectively. The cyclical pattern following a meal occurred at shorter intervals in the {{different parts of the}} colon. Conversely, the propulsion of the marker over the whole colon, which lasted 180 - 200 min, was accelerated by 30 % after feeding. Laxatives disrupted these cyclical motor events on the colon, by inducing mass movements which impeded the pellet formation and increased the rate of transit. The cyclical motor activity was also disrupted following the administration of opiate agonists, the rate of transit being decreased and propulsive activity inhibited.

40|$|The {{influence}} of acoustic stress on postprandial gastrointestinal motility, gastric emptying, and plasma gastrin, pancreatic polypeptide, motilin, and somatostatin was evaluated in conscious dogs. Six dogs were equipped with <b>strain-gauge</b> <b>transducers</b> and were exposed from 1 - 3 h after the meal to prerecorded music (80 - 90 dB broad frequency noise), which produced a significant (p {{less than or}} equal to 0. 05) lengthening of the gastric (31. 2 %) and jejunal (37. 0 %) postprandial pattern. In 4 other dogs with gastric cannula, a 2 -h session of acoustic stress beginning just after eating a radiolabeled standard meal induced a slowing of gastric emptying of both liquid (45. 7 %) and solid (47. 1 %) phases of the test meal when measured 0. 5 h after feeding. In contrast, when measured 2 h after feeding, similar values of gastric emptying of liquids and solids were observed in stressed and control animals. Compared with controls, the postprandial increases of plasma gastrin and pancreatic polypeptide levels were significantly enhanced in stressed animals and occurred early (15 min after the meal). Although postprandial decrease in plasma motilin was unchanged by acoustic stress, the rise in plasma somatostatin level was significantly (p {{less than or equal}} to 0. 05) prolonged in stressed dogs. These results indicate that acoustic stress affects gastric and intestinal postprandial motility in dogs, delaying the recovery of the migrating motor complex pattern, inducing a transient slowing of gastric emptying, and enhancing the feeding-induced release of gastrin, pancreatic polypeptide, and somatostatin. Such hormonal changes might be due to a direct effect of stress rather than being the consequence of acoustic stress-induced slowing of gastric emptying. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{degree of}} lung {{allograft}} inflation during harvest and storage may affect posttransplantation function. High volume ventilation causes pulmonary vascular injury and increased pulmonary capillary permeability. However, {{the effect of}} lung inflation on pulmonary capillary permeability after hypothermic flush and storage is unknown. The current {{study was designed to}} examine the effects of hyperinflation and hypoinflation during preservation on pulmonary vascular permeability. Methods: An isolated, ex vivo rabbit lung gravimetric model without the confounding effects of reperfusion was used to determine post pulmonary capillary filtration coefficient (Kf). New Zealand White rabbits (2. 75 to 3. 15 kg) were intubated and the lungs ventilated with room air (tidal volume 25 ml). After sternotomy and heparinization, the pulmonary artery was flushed with low potassium dextran– 1 % glucose solution (200 ml). The heart-lung block was then excised. Two studies were conducted. For measurement of changes in airway pressure and lung volume during preservation, lungs were inflated to one of four storage volumes (12, 25, 40, 55 ml) with room air, 100 % O 2, or 100 % N 2 and stored at 10 ° C in a sealed container filled with saline solution. During preservation, lung volume and airway pressure were measured at 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours. In the Kf study, lungs were inflated with 100 % O 2, 50 % O 2 (with 50 % N 2), or room air and preserved. After 24 hours of preservation at 10 ° C, the heart-lung block was suspended from a <b>strain-gauge</b> force <b>transducer</b> and the lungs were ventilated with room air. The pulmonary artery was connected to a reservoir of hetastarch solution (6 % hetastarch with 0. 9 % saline solution). Lung weight gain, airway pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, and left atrial pressure were measured continuously. After a brief flush with hetastarch solution, the reservoir was then elevated to achieve 1. 0 to 1. 5 mm Hg increments in pulmonary artery pressure. Results: The slope of subsequent steady-state lung weight gain was used to determine the Kf. The current study demonstrated the following: (1) changes in lung volume and airway pressure during storage increased with intraalveolar O 2 concentration, (2) irrespective of inflation, fraction of inspired oxygen, hyperinflation during lung preservation increased the Kf in a volume-dependent fashion; (3) Kf was increased in lungs stored hypoinflated with room air; and (4) at any inflation volume, the Kf was significantly increased with 100 % O 2 inflation after 24 hours of preservation.

Comparison was made among three distinct stent grafts: the Trivascular Enovus (nonporous ePTFE; four animals), the original Gore Excluder (porous ePTFE; five animals), and the Medtronic AneuRx (Dacron; four animals). Daily systemic and intra-AAA pressures were measured for 4 weeks. Intra-aneurysmal pressures were indexed to simultaneously measured systemic pressures. After 4 weeks, the aorta, the prosthetic aneurysm, and its contents were harvested, photographed, and processed for histologic investigation with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichrome staining. ResultsWithin 24 hours after exclusion, the mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure within the AAA sac tapered to less than 20 % of systemic pressure for all three stent graft types. Throughout the postoperative period, significantly lower indexed intra-aneurysmal pressures were present in the Enovus- and AneuRx-treated aneurysms as compared with those treated with the original Excluder stent graft (0. 05 ± 0. 04, 0. 16 ± 0. 06, and 0. 06 ± 0. 03 for the Enovus, Excluder, and AneuRx, respectively). Histologic analysis of the Enovus-treated aneurysms demonstrated intraluminal content characterized almost entirely by erythrocytes and infrequent white blood cells without the fibrin organization—characteristics of acute or chronic thrombus. This contrasted with the content of the Excluder-treated aneurysms, which contained poorly organized fibrin deposition suggestive of acute thrombus, and of the AneuRx-treated aneurysms, which demonstrated mature, well-organized collagenous connective tissue. ConclusionsExclusion of the AAA with the Enovus stent graft resulted in nearly complete elimination of intra-aneurysmal pressure in this model. Histologic analysis of the aneurysm content further suggested complete exclusion, including elimination of circulating clotting factors and fibroblasts responsible for thrombus formation and reorganization. Ultimately, clinical evaluation will be necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of this stent graft in preventing the development of endotension. Clinical RelevanceEndovascular aneurysm repair is an effective method for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) subjected to the unique complications of endoleak and endotension, the indirect pressurization of a sac in the absence of endoleak. In our model, AAA exclusion with the Enovus stent graft results in inhibition of fluid and serum transudation into the AAA sac, a corresponding prompt pressure decay profile, and near-complete elimination of intra-aneurysmal pressure. With the advent of implantable wireless pressure transducers, this research can be readily translated to the clinical setting. Future intraoperative and postoperative studies may help elucidate the clinical significance of pressure decay profiles in identifying successful AAA exclusion and monitoring for the development of endotension and its clinical sequelae...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThis {{study used}} a canine model of {{abdominal}} aortic aneurysms (AAAs) to compare intra-aneurysmal pressure and thrombus formation after exclusion with Dacron and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) stent-grafts. MethodsProsthetic AAAs with implanted <b>strain-gauge</b> pressure <b>transducers</b> were treated by stent-graft exclusion using Food and Drug Administration-approved devices in 10 mongrel dogs: five Dacron (AneuRx) and five ePTFE (original Excluder). Intra-aneurysmal pressure was measured over 4 weeks after AAA exclusion and indexed to the systemic pressure, {{represented as a}} percentage of a simultaneously obtained systemic pressure (value = 1. 0). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the intra-aneurysmal thrombus was performed at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after exclusion and expressed as a signal-to-noise ratio (S:N) to control for background signal intensity. Comparisons of pressures and S:N between the two stent-grafts was analyzed with the Student’s t test. Intra-aneurysmal thrombus was characterized histologically. ResultsIn animals excluded with both Dacron and ePTFE stent-grafts, the intra-aneurysmal pressure was nonpulsatile and reduced to < 30 % of systemic pressure. Significantly greater pressure transmission was observed after AAA exclusion using ePTFE compared with Dacron stent grafts (systolic pressure: ePTFE, 0. 28 ± 0. 12 vs Dacron, 0. 11 ± 0. 02, P <. 001; mean pressure: ePTFE, 0. 16 ± 0. 08 vs Dacron, 0. 06 ± 0. 02, P <. 001). MRI confirmed the absence of perfusion in all aneurysms. The T 1 -weighted signal intensity remained persistently elevated (S:N at 1 week, 2. 7 ± 0. 4 vs 2 weeks, 4. 0 ± 0. 2 vs 4 weeks, 5. 4 ± 1. 3) in ePTFE-treated intra-aneurysmal thrombus, suggesting an absence of thrombus organization. In contrast, progressive evolution of T 1 signal intensity in aneurysms excluded by Dacron stent-grafts was consistent with maturation from intact red blood cells (S:N at 1 week, 3. 3 ± 0. 4) to methemoglobin (S:N at 2 weeks, 6. 1 ± 0. 8), and then hemosiderin and ferritin (S:N at 4 weeks, 2. 4 ± 0. 5). Histologically, ePTFE-excluded aneurysms contained poorly organized thrombus with red blood cell fragments and haphazardly arranged fibrin deposition indicative of active remodeling and continued influx of transudated serum. In aneurysms excluded by Dacron stent-grafts, dense, mature collagenous connective tissue and organized fibrin were present, indicative of greater thrombus organization. ConclusionsStent-graft treatment reduces intra-aneurysmal pressure to < 30 % of systemic pressure when no endoleak is present; however, significantly greater pressure is present in aneurysms treated with porous ePTFE stent-grafts than Dacron grafts. Histologic and MRI imaging analysis suggest that active transudation of serous blood components may be contributing to this increased intra-aneurysmal pressure. Clinical RelevanceContinued expansion of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) {{in the absence of an}} endoleak after endovascular repair is thought to result from endotension. Clinical studies have shown that AAAs excluded with grafts made from expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) are more likely to result in aneurysm sac expansion, which may be the result of transudation of serous blood components through the stent-graft. This study used an animal model of AAA to examine aneurysm sac pressure and resulting thrombus in abdominal aortic aneurysms treated with either ePTFE or Dacron stent-grafts...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{clinical}} significance {{and treatment of}} retrograde collateral arterial perfusion of abdominal aortic aneurysms after endovascular repair (type II endoleak) have not been completely characterized. A canine abdominal aortic aneurysm model of type II endoleak with an implanted pressure transducer {{was used to evaluate}} the use of polyurethane foam to induce thrombosis of type II endoleaks. The effect on endoleak patency, intra-aneurysmal pressure, and thrombus histology was studied. MethodsProsthetic aneurysms with an intraluminal, solid-state, <b>strain-gauge</b> pressure <b>transducer</b> were created in the infrarenal aorta of 14 mongrel dogs. Aneurysm side-branch vessels were reimplanted into the prosthetic aneurysm of 10 animals by using a Carrel patch. Type II (retrograde) endoleaks were created by excluding the aneurysm from antegrade perfusion with an impermeable stent graft. Thrombosis of the type II endoleak was induced by implantation of polyurethane foam into the prosthetic aneurysm sac of four animals. Six animals with type II endoleaks were not treated. In four control animals, no collateral side branches were reimplanted, and therefore no endoleak was created. Intra-aneurysmal and systemic pressures were measured daily for 60 to 90 days after the implantation of the stent graft. Endoleak patency and flow were assessed during surgery and at the time of death by using angiographic imaging and duplex ultrasonography. Histologic analysis of the intra-aneurysmal thrombus was also performed. ResultsIntra-aneurysmal pressure values are indexed to systemic pressure and are represented {{as a percentage of the}} simultaneously obtained systemic pressure, which has a value of 1. 0. All six animals with untreated type II endoleaks maintained patency of the endoleak and side-branch arteries throughout the study period. Compared with control aneurysms that had no endoleak, animals with patent type II endoleaks exhibited significantly higher intra-aneurysmal pressurization (systolic pressure: patent type II endoleak, 0. 702 ± 0. 283; control, 0. 172 ± 0. 091; P <. 001; mean pressure: endoleak, 0. 784 ± 0. 229; control, 0. 137 ± 0. 102; P <. 001; pulse pressure: endoleak, 0. 406 ± 0. 248; control, 0. 098 ± 0. 077; P <. 001; P <. 001 for comparison for all groups by analysis of variance). Treatment of the type II endoleak with polyurethane foam induced thrombosis of the endoleak and feeding side-branch arteries in all four animals with type II endoleaks. This resulted in intra-aneurysmal pressures statistically indistinguishable from the controls (systolic pressure, 0. 183 ± 0. 08; mean pressure, 0. 142 ± 0. 09; pulse pressure, 0. 054 ± 0. 04; not significant). Angiography and histology documented persistent patency up to the time of death (mean, 64 days) for untreated type II endoleaks and confirmed thrombosis of polyurethane foam-treated endoleaks in all cases. ConclusionsUntreated type II endoleaks were associated with intra-aneurysmal pressures that were 70 % to 80 % of systemic pressure. Treatment with polyurethane foam resulted in a reduction of intra-aneurysmal pressure to a level that was indistinguishable from control aneurysms that had no endoleak. Clinical RelevanceEndovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms is dependent on the successful exclusion of the aneurysm from arterial circulation. Type II endoleaks originate from retrograde flow into the aneurysm sac. This study demonstrates the use of polyurethane foam to induce thrombosis in a canine model of a type II endoleak, thereby reducing intra-aneurysmal pressure to levels similar to levels in animals without endoleaks. This approach may be a strategy for future treatment of type II endoleaks...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{clinical}} significance of retrograde collateral arterial perfusion of abdominal aortic aneurysms after endovascular repair (type II endoleak) {{has not been}} completely characterized. In this study a canine model was used to analyze intra-aneurysmal pressure, thrombus histologic characteristics, endoleak patency, and radiographic appearance of type II endoleaks originating from single and multiple aneurysm side branches. MethodsProsthetic aneurysms with an intraluminal solid-state <b>strain-gauge</b> pressure <b>transducer</b> were created in the infrarenal aorta of 14 mongrel dogs. A single collateral side branch was reimplanted in 4 animals, multiple side branches were reimplanted in 6 animals, and no side branches were reimplanted in 4 control animals. Intra-aneurysmal and systemic pressure was measured for 60 to 90 days after creation of the type II endoleak. Endoleak patency and flow were assessed with duplex ultrasound scanning and cine–magnetic resonance angiography. Histologic analysis of the intra-aneurysmal thrombus was also performed. ResultsStent-graft exclusion reduced intra-aneurysmal pressure significantly in all animals, as compared with systemic pressure (P <. 001). All intra-aneurysmal pressure values are indexed to the systemic pressure, and are represented {{as a percentage of}} the simultaneously obtained systemic pressure, which has a value of 1. 0. Type II endoleaks originating from multiple side branches exhibited significantly increased intra-aneurysmal systolic pressure, mean pressure, and pulse pressure, as compared with endoleaks derived from either a single side branch (systolic pressure: multiple, 0. 70 ± 0. 28 vs single, 0. 50 ± 0. 19; P <. 001; mean pressure: multiple, 0. 78 ± 0. 23 vs single, 0. 59 ± 0. 22, P <. 001; pulse pressure: multiple, 0. 41 ± 0. 25 vs single, 0. 17 ± 0. 15, P <. 001) or excluded control aneurysms that had no side branches and no endoleak (systolic pressure, 0. 17 ± 0. 09; mean pressure, 0. 14 ± 0. 10; pulse pressure, 0. 098 ± 0. 08; P <. 001). Cine–magnetic resonance angiograms and duplex ultrasound scans documented persistent patency of multiple branch endoleaks up to the time of euthanasia. In contrast, single side branch endoleaks thrombosed within 3 days (P <. 001). Thrombus in the aneurysm sac in close proximity to the endoleak contained intact red blood cells and limited fibrin. Thrombus distant from the endoleak demonstrated extensive fibrin deposition and degraded red blood cells. ConclusionThe canine model may be used to reliably measure intra-aneurysmal pressure in the presence of patent and thrombosed type II endoleaks. In this model 2 or more side branches are necessary to maintain persistent patency of type II endoleaks. These endoleaks are associated with significantly elevated intra-aneurysmal pressure, that is, 70 % to 80 % of systemic pressure. These results suggest that persistent type II endoleaks have {{clinical significance}}. Clinical relevanceEndoleaks originating from retrograde flow in the side branch vessels of the aneurysm generate significant levels of intra-aneurysmal pressure, that is, 70 % to 80 % of systemic pressure. At least 2 patent side branch vessels appear to be necessary to cause persistent patency of type II endoleak in the canine model. Further studies will be necessary to enable more complete characterization of retrograde endoleaks and to extend these findings to allow clinical application. However, these results suggest that persistently patent type II endoleaks are of clinical significance and may require more intensive follow-up or intervention...|$|R
