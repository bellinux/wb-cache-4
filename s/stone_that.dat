5|$|According to some scholars, the Black Stone was {{the same}} <b>stone</b> <b>that</b> Islamic {{tradition}} describes as greeting Muhammad before his prophethood. This led to a debate about whether the Black Stone's greeting comprised actual speech or merely a sound, and following that, whether the stone was a living creature or an inanimate object. Whichever was the case, the stone was held to be a symbol of prophethood.|$|E
5|$|In 1987 a clock {{tower and}} a {{fountain}} were erected at Council Negri Monument. A centenary <b>stone</b> <b>that</b> was erected in 1967 {{to commemorate the}} event is kept under the clock tower. The Bintulu Tua Pek Kong temple (near Tamu Bintulu) {{is believed to have}} been built in the 1890s to purge the town from evil spirits. The temple survived World War II, and was rebuilt after the discovery of oil and gas reserves offshore.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} {{that there was a}} facade in front of the chamber, as is evident at other chambered tombs in Britain, such as West Kennet Long Barrow and Wayland's Smithy. It is also possible that there was a portal stone atop the chamber, as was apparent at Kit's Coty House and Lower Kit's Coty House. Many of the larger slabs of <b>stone</b> <b>that</b> have fallen down the slope on the eastern end of the monument may have been parts of this facade or portal.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1799, with the Napoleonic {{discovery}} of a trilingual (i.e. hieroglyphic, Demotic, Greek) stela inscription on the Rosetta <b>Stone,</b> <b>that</b> modern scholars were able to decipher ancient Egyptian literature. The first major effort to translate the hieroglyphs of the Rosetta Stone was made by Jean-François Champollion (1790–1832) in 1822. The earliest translation efforts of Egyptian literature during the 19th century were attempts to confirm Biblical events.|$|E
5|$|The Faculty of Medicine {{remained}} the school's only functioning faculty until 1843 when the Faculty of Arts commenced {{teaching in the}} newly constructed Arts Building and East Wing (Dawson Hall). The university also historically has strong linkage with The Canadian Grenadier Guards, a military regiment in which James McGill served as the Lieutenant-Colonel. This title is marked upon the <b>stone</b> <b>that</b> stands before the Arts building, from where the Guards step off annually to commemorate Remembrance Day.|$|E

5|$|The Medway long barrows all {{conformed}} {{to the same}} general design plan, and are all aligned on an east to west axis. Each had a stone chamber at {{the eastern end of}} the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance. The chambers were constructed from sarsen, a dense, hard, and durable <b>stone</b> <b>that</b> occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of silicified sand from the Eocene epoch. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them {{to the site of the}} monument to be erected.|$|E
5|$|The Motmot Capstone is an inscribed <b>stone</b> <b>that</b> {{was placed}} over a tomb under Structure 10L-26. Its face was finely sculpted with {{portraits of the}} first two kings of the Copán dynasty, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and K'inich Popol Hol, facing towards each other with a double column of hieroglyphs between them, all {{contained}} within a quatrefoil frame. The frame and the hieroglyphic names of mythological locations underneath the feet of the two kings place them in a supernatural realm. The capstone bears two calendrical dates, in AD435 and AD441. The second of these is probably the date that the capstone was dedicated.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{location}} of the Vijithapura fortress is uncertain. A village with the same name near the ancient Kalawewa reservoir {{may have been the}} place where the battle took place. There is an ancient temple here as well as a granite <b>stone</b> <b>that</b> locals believe to have been used by Dutthagamani's soldiers to sharpen their swords However, other historians and archaeologists believe that the location is close to Kaduruwela near Polonnaruwa, where the ruins of an ancient fortress have been found.|$|E

5|$|The local {{volcanic}} lava <b>stone</b> <b>that</b> {{was used}} in the construction of many Sicilian Baroque buildings, because this was the most readily available. Many sculptors and stone-cutters of the period lived at the foot of Mount Etna, making a diversity of objects, including balustrades, pillars, fountains and seats for buildings. Shades of black or grey were used to create contrasting decorative effects, accentuating the Baroque love of light and shade as demonstrated in (illustration 2).|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} {{takes the}} form of a Tuscan column of Purbeck Marble construction, on which stands a statue of Saint George slaying a dragon. Lady Horner first hoped to have an original sculpture and approached several artists but all quotes she received would have exceeded the village's budget, so she instead commissioned a copy of a statue in the Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey. The column stands on a tall, narrow pedestal in Portland <b>stone</b> <b>that</b> bears the inscription: , a verse suggested by Robert Bridges, the poet laureate, in correspondence with Lady Horner. A cross is engraved immediately above.|$|E
5|$|The <b>stone</b> <b>that</b> was quarried is arkose of the Famennian stage. Approximately 360 {{million years}} ago, {{the thrust of}} forming Gondwana plates raised the seabed. Meanwhile, an ice age {{occurred}} in regions near the poles. Marine regression allowed sedimentation of detrital sand and clays which left large shoals of hard sandstone with ripple marks, alternating with levels more or less shaley according to their clay's content.|$|E

5|$|During the War of 1812, the British forces {{landed on}} the island and told the keeper's wife, Thankful <b>Stone,</b> <b>that</b> they had nothing to fear as long as they kept the light burning. Later, the keeper, Solomon Stone, had to put the light out per order of the New London customs inspector. The British {{threatened}} to blow up the lighthouse, and Stone got an order to relight the lighthouse. In 1856, the light was upgraded from the twelve lamps to a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The light's new characteristic was a fixed light with a flash every two seconds. Around 1976, a GE 1000-watt bulb was used. When the lighthouse was repaired after the fire and automated in 1978, a modern optic replaced the Fresnel lens. The lighthouse currently uses a VRB-25 lens. The lighthouse switched to solar power in 1988. The light's characteristic is a flash of white light every ten seconds. It continues to operate as a navigational aid to the nearby Intracoastal Waterway.|$|E
5|$|Sarawak can {{be divided}} into two {{geological}} zones: the Sunda Shield, which extends southwest from the Batang Lupar River (near Sri Aman) and forms the southern tip of Sarawak, and the geosyncline region, which extends northeast to the Batang Lupar River, forming the central and northern regions of Sarawak. The oldest rock type in southern Sarawak is schist formed during the Carboniferous and Lower Permian times, while the youngest igneous rock in this region, andesite, can be found at Sematan. Geological formation of the central and northern regions started during the late Cretaceous period. Other types of <b>stone</b> <b>that</b> can be found in central and northern Sarawak are shale, sandstone, and chert.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the major}} {{architecture}} of the site core is covered by secondary forest, including some large trees, {{while much of the}} city's remains lie within the modern village, including mounds of various sizes. Some mounds were destroyed in order to build the modern streets, in other cases the mounds were robbed of <b>stone</b> <b>that</b> was reused in modern construction. There are also instances where modern houses have been built on top of ancient mound platforms. Modern houses had previously also occupied the outskirts of the acropolis but were relocated during the Guatemalan Civil War in the late 20th century due to guerrilla activity.|$|E
