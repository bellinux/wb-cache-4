5|$|The Spirit of Fire {{releases}} the new Halo, but faces immediate resistance upon {{it from the}} Banished. Back on the Ark, Alice-130 and Douglas-042 destroy enemy barricades and prevent reinforcements, including Atriox, from reaching the Halo; they then use the portal network to reach the Halo themselves. There, Professor Anders is escorted to the ring’s control room, where the firing system of the structure is deactivated and a <b>signal</b> <b>beacon</b> is set. Meanwhile, the Spirit of Fires forces are locked in a struggle with {{the remnants of the}} Banished. Anders finds the gravity controls for the Halo and uses them to raise the land that the remaining Banished are standing on into space where it disintegrates. The ground forces return to the Spirit of Fire, but Anders and the Halo enter slipspace as they cannot halt the jump's countdown. Before the Halo jumps, Anders promises to get help from the UNSC as soon as possible. On the Ark, Atriox and a legion of Banished still live, preparing for the next fight against the UNSC. Meanwhile, the Halo carrying Anders drops out of slipspace prematurely, only to encounter a Foreunner construct known as a Guardian.|$|E
25|$|At 6:35 a.m., the {{helicopters}} approached {{the area where}} O'Grady's <b>signal</b> <b>beacon</b> had been traced. The pilots saw bright yellow smoke coming from trees near a rocky pasture where O'Grady had set off a flare. The first Stallion, commanded by Major William Tarbutton, touched down and 20 Marines jumped off the aircraft {{and set up a}} defensive perimeter. As the second Sea Stallion landed, a figure with a pistol {{who turned out to be}} the missing pilot appeared running towards the Marines and immediately went to the Sea Stallion. As the side door opened, he was pulled in before the second 20 Marines poised to leave by the rear ramp could even move. They were called back to their seats, and those who had formed the defensive perimeter reboarded the other helicopter. After a quick head count, the Stallions took off. They had been on the ground no more than seven minutes.|$|E
25|$|Morgoth {{had learned}} of the battle plan through his spies and his agent Uldor son of Ulfang, who {{proved to be a}} traitor, delaying Maedhros with false {{information}} and preventing the lighting of the <b>signal</b> <b>beacon</b> on Dorthonion. To further disrupt the coordination of Maedhros' plan a large detachment of Orcs was sent west from Angband with orders to provoke Fingon's host in the west into a premature attack. When Fingon's host stayed in position, the Captains of the Orc-host brought a prisoner, Gelmir, the brother of Gwindor, and he was mutilated and beheaded in sight of the Elves. Tragically, though Fingon's army was concealed in the Shadowy Mountains over a very long front, the Orc captain killed Gelmir in front of Gwindor's position. Enraged, Gwindor and his company of Elves from Nargothrond broke ranks and charged, killing the heralds and driving into the bulk of the Angband army, and Fingon promptly ordered his entire army to charge. The Army of Hithlum in this first encounter nearly managed to disrupt Morgoth's plans by destroying his western army on the plains of Anfauglith.|$|E

5000|$|The castles [...] "tower and fortalice" [...] {{are also}} {{mentioned}} in a charter from the crown in 1587. In times of clan warfare, a <b>signal</b> <b>beacon</b> was lit {{on the highest}} tower of Foulis Castle to gather the clan under arms, hence the Munro slogan or gathering cry of [...] "Caisteal Foghlais na theine," [...] meaning Castle Foulis ablaze.|$|E
50|$|Visual {{techniques}} such as smoke <b>signals,</b> <b>beacon</b> fires, hydraulic telegraphs, ship flags and semaphore lines were the earliest forms of optical communication. Hydraulic telegraph semaphores {{date back to the}} 4th century BCE Greece. Distress flares are still used by mariners in emergencies, while lighthouses and navigation lights are used to communicate navigation hazards.|$|R
25|$|The first {{telegraphs}} came in {{the form}} of optical telegraph, including the use of smoke <b>signals,</b> <b>beacons,</b> or reflected light, which have existed since ancient times. Early proposals for an optical telegraph system were made to the Royal Society by Robert Hooke in 1684 and were first implemented on an experimental level by Sir Richard Lovell Edgeworth in 1767.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduced}} some {{indoor positioning}} techniques. On this basis, the indoor ultrasonic positioning {{system based on}} CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) -TDOA (Time Difference of Arrival) is proposed, and its operating principle and the analysis of ultrasonic signals are described. The system based {{on the character of}} radio frequency and ultrasonic sensors encodes the ultrasonic signal using CDMA technology, so that the destination node can distinguish each <b>beacon</b> <b>signal</b> sent <b>beacon</b> ultrasound <b>signal,</b> and combines with the RF signal to achieve TDOA location algorithm, and ultimately performs three-dimensional positioning. Using the MATLAB/Simulink blocks, the three ultrasonic <b>beacon</b> <b>signals</b> are simulated and discussed. Finally, simulation results show that the three ultrasonic <b>beacon</b> <b>signals</b> can be received and identified in the destination node...|$|R

50|$|When {{the story}} begins, Huyghens {{receives}} a signal indicating that a ship {{is about to}} land near his station. The ship drops off its sole passenger, an officer with the Colonial Survey named Roane (no first name given), and then departs. Roane soon learns that Huyghens is an illegal trespasser on the planet and that his (Huyghens') <b>signal</b> <b>beacon</b> was not that of the authorized colony. For his part, Huyghens is {{surprised to learn that}} there was an authorized colony on the same planet. The two men put their minds to the question of why the authorized colony's <b>signal</b> <b>beacon</b> was not working and soon determine that it has been replaced with a low-technology emergency beacon. From this, the two men surmise that the authorized colony has been overrun by the indigenous predators, but that some colonists might still be alive in the mine tunnels that the colony was expected to have dug.|$|E

In 1630 Boston was settled by the Massachusetts Bay Company. The southwestern slope was used by the city for military drills and livestock grazing. In 1634 a <b>signal</b> <b>beacon</b> was established {{on the top of the}} hill. Sailors and British soldiers visited the north slope of Beacon Hill during the 17th and 18th centuries.

5000|$|There were {{especially}} two terms used in {{claims in the}} 642 patents that required clarification. In both the district and circuit court, potential infringement centered on the definition of “synchronous”.

50|$|On 14 September 1950 a Douglas C-54 Skymaster {{aircraft}} {{belonging to}} the Icelandic airline Loftleiðir made an emergency landing on the Vatnajökull glacier at Bárðarbunga during a cargo flight from Luxembourg to Reykjavík. There were no fatalities, but damaged radio equipment left them unable to communicate their location. After two days the crew started the emergency SOS <b>signal</b> <b>beacon</b> in the rubber life-raft and a Loftleiðir Catalina aircraft spotted them. The C-54's cargo included {{the body of a}} deceased USAF colonel, prompting American assistance. A USAF C-47 equipped with skis landed on the glacier but was unable to take off again, so it had to be abandoned. After six days both crews were rescued by a ski-patrol from Akureyri. Later Loftleiðir bought the stranded C-47 from the USAF for $700. In April 1951 it was dug out of the snow and towed down the mountain by two bulldozers, where it was started and flown to Reykjavik.|$|E
50|$|Being {{close to}} the sea and {{to the rest of}} Europe has {{affected}} Mongeham's history. In 1415 Henry V granted the Fogge family of Mongeham the exclusive rights to brew and ship beer to the English soldiers in Calais. Behind the local Engineering Works is a steep bank dropping down to a brook. This is all that remains of the ancient Mongeham Docks, long since silted up. Chalk and lime used in the building of Deal Castle in 1538 was quarried from a pit called Pope's Hall. At the time of the Armada in 1588 Mongeham had a <b>signal</b> <b>beacon</b> which would have been lit to raise the alarm if the Spanish landed. Later, the smugglers hid their spoils near the village. Mongeham is also known for its lesser known history, the first wooden bike recorded to have been manufactured was created in this very town, the town is also home to a very well known truffle forager who has been foraging under the trees for many years.|$|E
