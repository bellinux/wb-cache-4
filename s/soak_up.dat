5|$|A {{significant}} {{but small}} percentage of people have employment {{in the oil industry}} owing to the proximity of oil rigs on the Cromarty Firth. Other locally significant industries include forestry, tourism and catering. A significant number of people work in larger nearby localities, such as Inverness, Dingwall, Alness and Invergordon, which is why only 14% of households in the zone own no car. 10.4% {{of the population of the}} zone are self-employed, and 28% economically inactive, roughly corresponding with the Highland averages. There are also two hotels and two bars, which <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> much of the tourist income that the town generates.|$|E
5|$|Development for Mulan {{began in}} 1994, after the {{production}} team sent {{a select group}} of artistic supervisors to China for three weeks to take photographs and drawings of local landmarks for inspiration; and to <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> local culture. Key members of the creative team at the time – Pam Coats, Barry Cook, Ric Sluiter, Robert Walker, and Mark Henn – were invited to travel to China as a research trip to study the landscape, people, and history of the original legend. From June 17 to July 2, 1994, the research trip flew to Beijing, China, which is where Pam Coats became inspired by the placement of flags on the Great Wall, Datong, Luoyang, Xi'an, Jiayuguan, Dunhuang, and Guilin.|$|E
5|$|The thin corpus spongiosum of {{the penis}} {{runs along the}} {{underside}} of the penile shaft, enveloping the urethra, and expands at the end to form the glans. It partially contributes to erection, which are primarily caused by the two corpora cavernosa that comprise the bulk of the shaft; like the female cavernosa, the male cavernosa <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> blood and become erect when sexually excited. The male corpora cavernosa taper off internally on reaching the spongiosum head. With regard to the Y-shape of the cavernosa– crown, body, and legs– the body accounts for much more of the structure in men, and the legs are stubbier; typically, the cavernosa are longer and thicker in males than in females.|$|E

5|$|With the {{exception}} of the cormorants and some terns, and in common with most other birds, all seabirds have waterproof plumage. However, compared to land birds, they have far more feathers protecting their bodies. This dense plumage is better able to protect the bird from getting wet, and cold is kept out by a dense layer of down feathers. The cormorants possess a layer of unique feathers that retain a smaller layer of air (compared to other diving birds) but otherwise <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> water. This allows them to swim without fighting the buoyancy that retaining air in the feathers causes, yet retain enough air to prevent the bird losing excessive heat through contact with water.|$|E
25|$|A {{small amount}} of chaff is {{produced}} during roasting from the skin left on the seed after processing. Chaff is usually removed from the seeds by air movement, though a small amount is added to dark roast coffees to <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> oils on the seeds.|$|E

5000|$|Palladium is {{sometimes}} metaphorically called a [...] "metal sponge" [...] (not {{to be confused}} with more literal metal sponges) because it <b>soaks</b> <b>up</b> hydrogen [...] "like a sponge <b>soaks</b> <b>up</b> water".At room temperature and atmospheric pressure (standard ambient temperature and pressure),palladium can absorb up to 900 times its own volume of hydrogen.As of 1995, hydrogen can be absorbed into the metal-hydride and then desorbed back out for thousands of cycles. Researchers look for ways to extend the useful life of palladium storage.|$|R
25|$|Work on MX also continued, and by {{the mid-1970s}} the {{preferred}} MX basing mode was the Multiple Protective Shelter (MPS) concept. In this system each MX missile would be installed in a network of hardened shelters, 23 in most plans, and moved between them at random. The transports would be camouflaged and duplicated so the Soviets would not know where the missiles were. A counterforce attack would thus require the Soviets to expend 23 warheads for every MX missile to ensure destruction. With a total of 4,500 shelters and 200 missiles moving between them, the system could <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> {{a significant portion of}} the Soviet's 5,928 ICBM warheads and survive. In this basing mode, a system like Safeguard was of little use. If the Soviets needed to fire 4,500 warheads to ensure the destruction of the MX force, expending another 100 to <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> an ABM system was of little consequence.|$|E

25|$|A knotted gag is a {{blend of}} the ball and cleave gags. The scarf either has a knot tied in the middle and placed in the gagged person's mouth or is an over-the-mouth gag (OTM) placed {{backward}} with the knot tied inside the person's mouth. The knotted gag is able to <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> the saliva that the ball gag does not and can be easily washed for reuse.

25|$|Degradation during service life, {{or after}} {{careless}} disposal, is a chemical change that drastically reduces the {{average molecular weight}} of the polyvinyl chloride polymer. Since the mechanical integrity of a plastic depends on its high average molecular weight, wear and tear inevitably weakens the material. Weathering degradation of plastics results in their surface embrittlement and microcracking, yielding microparticles that continue on in the environment. Also known as microplastics, these particles act like sponges and <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) around them. Thus laden {{with high levels of}} POPs, the microparticles are often ingested by organisms in the biosphere.|$|E
25|$|The {{moisture}} given off by {{the human}} body, even when not exercising and sweating, will condense against {{the inside of the}} dry duit, and the way this condensate is handled by the underwear material will influence the comfort of the diver. If the underwear soaks up this moisture it will feel cold and clammy, particularly if this layer is against the skin. Materials which wick the moisture away from the skin and do not <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> the condensate will be more comfortable. Early thermal undersuits for drysuits were commonly made from wool, as it retains its insulating properties better when wet than most other natural fibres.|$|E

25|$|In {{order for}} the seed coat to split, the embryo must imbibe (<b>soak</b> <b>up</b> water), which causes it to swell, {{splitting}} the seed coat. However, {{the nature of the}} seed coat determines how rapidly water can penetrate and subsequently initiate germination. The rate of imbibition is dependent on the permeability of the seed coat, amount of water in the environment and the area of contact the seed has to the source of water. For some seeds, imbibing too much water too quickly can kill the seed. For some seeds, once water is imbibed the germination process cannot be stopped, and drying then becomes fatal. Other seeds can imbibe and lose water a few times without causing ill effects, but drying can cause secondary dormancy.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the midwife}} {{received}} the infant, {{placed it in}} pieces of cloth, cut the umbilical cord, and cleansed the baby. The child was sprinkled with “fine and powdery salt, or natron or aphronitre” to <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> the birth residue, rinsed, and then powdered and rinsed again. Next, the midwives cleared away any and all mucus present from the nose, mouth, ears, or anus. Midwives were encouraged by Soranus to put olive oil in the baby’s eyes to cleanse away any birth residue, and to place a piece of wool soaked in olive oil over the umbilical cord. After the delivery, the midwife made the initial call {{on whether or not}} an infant was healthy and fit to rear. She inspected the newborn for congenital deformities and testing its cry to hear {{whether or not it was}} robust and hearty. Ultimately, midwives made a determination about the chances for an infant’s survival and likely recommended that a newborn with any severe deformities be exposed.|$|E
25|$|Some {{birds have}} {{a supply of}} powder down {{feathers}} which grow continuously, with small particles regularly breaking off from {{the ends of the}} barbules. These particles produce a powder that sifts through the feathers on the bird's body and acts as a waterproofing agent and a feather conditioner. Powder down has evolved independently in several taxa and can be found in down as well as in pennaceous feathers. They may be scattered in plumage as in the pigeons and parrots or in localized patches on the breast, belly, or flanks, as in herons and frogmouths. Herons use their bill to break the powder down feathers and to spread them, while cockatoos may use their head as a powder puff to apply the powder. Waterproofing can be lost by exposure to emulsifying agents due to human pollution. Feathers can then become waterlogged, causing the bird to sink. It is also very difficult to clean and rescue birds whose feathers have been fouled by oil spills. The feathers of cormorants <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> water and help to reduce buoyancy, thereby allowing the birds to swim submerged.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} standardize the tetrazolium test {{for evaluation of}} viability of Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. and Schizolobium parahyba Vell. Blake seeds.

25|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} Duntov created for Sting Ray was essentially a frame-mounted differential with U-jointed half-shafts tied together by a transverse leaf spring – a design derived from the CERV I concept. Rubber-cushioned struts carried the differential, which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion, especially on rougher roads. The transverse spring was bolted {{to the rear of}} the differential case. A control arm extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a hub carrier, with a trailing radius rod mounted behind it. The half-shafts functioned like upper control arms. The lower arms controlled vertical wheel motion, while the trailing rods took care of fore/aft wheel motion and transferred braking torque to the frame. Shock absorbers were conventional twin-tube units. Considerably lighter than the old solid axle, the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in unsprung weight, which was important since the 1963 model would retain the previous generation's outboard rear brakes. The new model's front suspension would be much as before, with unequal-length upper and lower A-arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks, plus a standard anti-roll bar. Steering remained the conventional recirculating-ball steering design, but it was geared at a higher 19.6:1 overall ratio (previously 21.0:1). Bolted to the frame rail at one end and to the relay rod at the other was a new hydraulic steering damper (essentially a shock absorber), which helped <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> bumps before they reached the steering wheel. What's more, hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette – except on cars with the two most powerful engines – and offer a faster 17.1:1 ratio, which reduced lock-to-lock turns from 3.4 to just 2.9.|$|E

500|$|While {{the storm}} was over water, small craft {{advisories}} were issued by the Coast Guard in addition to cautioning people on vacation in South Padre Island to avoid the beaches. However, {{as it was a}} Sunday evening, most of the ships were already coming into port. As Amelia approached the Texas coast, gale warnings were issued for the area from Brownsville to Port O'Connor on July 30.
