Eve was sitting on a low stool at the feet of Mrs Liston, engaged in ornamenting a bright blue fire-bag with bead and quill work of the most gorgeous colouring and elegant design. The design, of course, was her own. Mrs Liston was knitting small squares of open cotton-work, of a stitch so large that wooden needles {{about the size of a}} goose-quill were necessary. It was the only work that the poor old lady's weak eyesight and trembling hands could accomplish, and the <b>simple</b> <b>stitch</b> required little exercise of mind or muscle. When Mrs Liston completed a square she rolled it away. When sixteen squares were finished, she sewed them together and formed a strip about eight feet long and six inches broad. When sixteen such strips were completed, she sewed them all together and thus produced a bed-quilt. Quilts of this sort she presented periodically, with much ceremony and demonstration of regard, to her most intimate friends. In that region the old lady had not many intimate friends, but then it luckily took much time to produce a quilt.|$|E

40|$|Deltoid {{detachment}} {{is one of}} {{the complications}} in open rotator cuff repair. Although it is often described, the actual prevalence, time at which it occurs and the predisposing causes are still unknown. We prospectively studied 112 patients with massive rotator cuff tears {{with a mean age of}} 67. The surgical approach was performed with a lateral para-acromial incision. Clinical assessment was performed with Constant’s method. Of the 112 patients, 9 (8 %) had deltoid detachment. It occurred about 3  months after surgery. Of the nine patients, two underwent revision surgery for the deltoid trans-bone reattachment. At the follow-up, the patients with deltoid detachment had a mean increase of only 5. 5 points in the Constant score compared to that of 16. 9 obtained by the control group. Deltoid reattachment, performed on the two patients, provided a mean increase of 7 points only with respect to the post-operative control at the 4 th month. Considering the unsatisfactory functional result consequent to deltoid detachment and the slight improvement obtained with the reattachment, we recommend the following: use suture thread thicker than # 2, do not use a <b>simple</b> <b>stitch</b> and avoid extending acromioplasty to the lateral margin of the acromion...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In studies {{concerning}} {{the stability of}} surgical tendon fixation techniques, a large variety of test configurations is found resulting in a broad scatter of results. The goal {{of this study was}} to establish a reliable test protocol for the investigation of the stability of repair techniques. At 88 fresh bovine shoulders, four different suture configurations were tested: simple stitches, mattress sutures, modified Mason-Allen configuration and double-row configuration. The difference in response to load cycles with native samples and that after repair was recorded. Bioresorbable anchors were used for tendon fixation, in a second run tendons were affixed to metal plates, and with a third run fixation stability was monitored with a video camera. The double-row technique was the most stable one with the lowest values of compliance at all selected levels of gap formation followed by the mattress suture configuration. The <b>simple</b> <b>stitch</b> configuration and the modified Mason-Allen tech-niques were the most compliant techniques. By establishing this test protocol, we achieved a very accurate method of measurement (accuracy of 2 lm) with as few external influences as possible. The great advantage is that the proposed protocol allows the measurement of the mechanical quality of the suture fixation without an external device such as calipers.

40|$|PURPOSE: A new {{and more}} {{anatomical}} technique for SLAP II lesions repair is described. It consists in the reattachment of the medial aspect of the biceps anchor to the superior glenoid neck with a mattress stitch posterior and medial to the biceps anchor and a <b>simple</b> <b>stitch</b> placed anteriorly to the biceps. METHODS: From 2011 to 2012, 14 patients matching the inclusion criteria were selected for the study. A visual analogic scale, ROWE, UCLA, ASES and Constant scores were used to make evaluation. The passive ROM before surgery, at final follow-up, and the resumption of sports activities were analysed. RESULTS: The Constant, ASES, UCLA and ROWE scores passed from 64. 6 (SD 13. 9), 76. 9 (SD 22. 4), 28. 4 (SD 23. 8) and 53. 6 (SD 20. 6) to, respectively, 92. 6 (SD 11. 8), 108. 3 (SD 8. 5), 33. 6 (SD 2. 7) and 96. 5 (SD 7. 2) at final follow-up. Of the four patients {{who had participated in}} agonistic overhead athletics preoperatively, all of them were able to return to their preinjury level. No complications were observed in the present study. CONCLUSION: In our technique, the anatomy is respected leaving the articular aspect of the superior labrum loose and reinforcing the medial side. The clinical relevance of this work is that probably this technique could improve clinical results, giving a better mobility of the shoulder and a return to the same preoperative level in overhead athletes...|$|E

40|$|The Lovers' is a {{short term}} site {{specific}} installation commissioned by PUBLICARTHOUSE for the Duke of York public house, Royal Tunbridge Wells. The installation is inspired by {{the history of the}} pub and common folk law regarding Frederick Augustus, Duke of York and Albany (1763 – 1827) who was thought to bring his mistress to the Duke of York pub. The Duke, famed for his indecisiveness in battle as well as in love was 'taken to the cleaners' by his mistress Mary Ann Clarke; it is said that the well known nursery rhyme 'The Grand Old Duke of York' is attributed to him. Using reclaimed garments the site specific installation presents a parallel story, instigated by the historical research into the Duke's life and the mid century (20 th) black and white photo of young men playing darts, currently hanging in the pub. The piece aims to draw upon the layers of romantic liaisons and social interaction taken place over the years the pub has been trading and the atmosphere of the pub environment, where stories are told and intimacies are revealed. The worked garments are placed in the pub as if they have been mistakenly left behind; waiting for their owners to return and claim them. Initial forays into the lost property at the pub revealed the array of hats, coats, scarves and gloves which have been left behind. One curious object, a pad with notes taken in shorthand became influential to the work. Using a reclaimed man's jacket and reclaimed female gloves, the familiar story unfolds. Profiles of two individuals are alluded to through a stream of consciousness, fleeting thoughts and emotions mirroring those of their historical counterparts and references how garments can reflect the experiences, history and shape of its wearer. <b>Simple</b> <b>stitch</b> is used to layer these imagined 'outpourings' or 'stories'. Developing the tradition of woven 'name tapes' sewn into clothing for identification, the tapes in the installation, used in abundance, have been woven with the story that defines the wearers identity, often a burden carried everywhere they go.

A resistência variou com média de 127, 50 N com o ponto simples, 163, 95 N com o duplo e com o ponto de Mason-Allen modificado esta foi de 198, 45 N. CONCLUSÃO: não existe diferença da resistência no tendão quanto à falha na interface sutura - tendão comparando-se o ponto duplo com o Mason-Allen modificado e os pontos simples e duplo, porém há diferença quando comparados os pontos simples e Mason-Allen modificado. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the rotator cuff tendon resistance at the interface tendon-suture using three different sorts of <b>stitches</b> (<b>simple,</b> mattress and modified Mason-Allen). METHODS: To do this, 30 rotator cuffs were totally dissected from 15 specimens, which were 45 years old on average. The tests were done using a Kratos® 500 / 2000 machine and the statistical analyses applied were the Student t-test, ANOVA test, Multiple Bonferroni Comparison, and Pearson's correlation coefficients; all the analyses used a significance level of 5 %. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed regarding the age, sample sizes and tendon displacement. The tendon resistance was 127. 50 N on average when <b>Simple</b> <b>stitches</b> were used, 163. 95 N when Double stitches were used and 198. 45 N when the Modified Mason-Allen Knot was used. CONCLUSION: Although the tendon resistance at the interface tendon-suture was higher using the Modified Mason-Allen stitches than it was when using the Double and Simple Knots, there was no difference in tendon resistance when using the Modified Mason-Allen and Double stitches.

It traditionally uses red thread, chosen because red dyes were the first commercially available colorfast dyes, in the form of Turkey red embroidery floss. Redwork designs are composed of <b>simple</b> <b>stitches</b> and were mainly used to decorate household objects in the 19th and 20th centuries, especially quilts. Patterns for individual quilt blocks were sold for a penny in the United States, making them popular and affordable. In the 21st century, redwork has seen a resurgence among crafters. The main stitch used in redwork is backstitch or outline stitching, formerly known as Kensington stitch. Redwork was a common introductory form of embroidery taught to children in the 19th and 20th century. Children would make quilts decorated with redwork motifs, with motifs of various sizes prior to approximately 1910 and uniform sizes after that year. It was also a way for women with skills in pattern stamping or embroidery to generate their own source of income from the home.|$|R
