40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{theoretical}} and numerical aspects of shape optimization for flow problems. In a first part we investigate the controllability of shape-dependent operators. We derive a characterization for the image {{space of a}} potential flow operator and draw a connection to its stagnation points. And we show approximate controllability for linearized shape-dependent operators based on the potential flow, Stokes flow and the instationary heat equation. In a numerical part we introduce a new approach for shape optimization problems with state constraints and non differentiable cost functionals. We use conformal pull-back to reformulate the problem on a fixed reference domain. The resulting nonlinear problem can be discretized and solved using discrete optimization. Finally, we consider the industrial problem of designing an optimal distributor geometry for <b>spin</b> <b>packs</b> as used in fiber production. The goal is to construct a geometry with a certain wall shear stress distribution. This problem is solved using classical L 2 shape optimization...|$|R
40|$|The <b>spun</b> <b>packed</b> {{cell volume}} (PCV, hematocrit) {{is a key}} {{measurement}} on which are based hematology instrument calibration, reference range determination, and assignment of values to calibrators/controls. In 2001, the International Council for Stan-dardization in Haematology (ICSH) recommended a Reference PCV method, which is fully traceable to the ICSH reference hemoglobin method. Because of its complexity, however, this method is impractical for occasional use in routine laboratories and is therefore intended primarily for use by manufacturers of capillary microhematocrit tubes, liquid calibrators, and multi-channel analyzers. In response {{to the need for}} a simpler method—accessible to all routine laboratories—the ICSH offers this “Surrogate Reference ” PCV procedure. It is traceable to the original ICSH Reference PCV method and is based on spun PCVs obtained using borosilicate capillary tubes with an already-known relationship to this reference procedure. This ICSH “Surro-gate Reference ” PCV method is substantially simpler, thus putting it within the reach of most routine hematology laboratories...|$|R

40|$|The {{pressure}} drop resulting from polyamide 6 flow through industrial spinnerets and wire-mesh filters was examined {{as a possible}} parameter for improving spinning process constancy with experimental techniques and a numerical approach. The rheological characterization of the polymer melt was performed with a capillary rheometer and a controlled-stress rotational rheometer equipped with a high-temperature oven cell. Measurements {{in a nitrogen atmosphere}} were carried out at different temperatures and at various moisture contents to determine the effect of the postcondensation process on the rheological properties of the polymer melt. These experiments were used to collect all basic material information necessary to fit the data with the purely viscous Cross model and the viscoelastic Kaye, Bernstein, Kearsley, Zappas (K-BKZ) model. A spinning pilot plant (consisting of an extruder, a gear pump, a pressure sensor, and a spin beam with several <b>spin</b> <b>packs</b> installed) was used to measure {{pressure drop}} values through industrial spinnerets and through two types of filters: (1) Dutch twilled weave filters and (2) sintered filters. Pilot plant tests on filters showed that in the examined range of melt throughputs, the pressure drop increased linearly with an increase in the melt flow rate for all the filters considered. The results with respect to the spinneret geometry led {{to the conclusion that the}} numerical simulations gave satisfactory predictions even for experimental data coming from complex systems such as spinning plants, as long as extensional properties were accounted for by the model. On the contrary, pressure drop predictions obtained from the Cross model underestimated the pilot plant values by approximately 20 % because of the inability of the model to consider the extensional component of the flow.

40|$|Some {{properties}} and structural aspects of fibers obtained by spinning, {{in a wide}} range of take-up speed (2, 800 - 4, 400 m/min), of commercial samples of PET, produced by dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) and the terephthalic acid (TPA) processes, are compared. For a same take-up speed, the considered fibers from TPA are <b>spun</b> at lower <b>pack</b> pressures and always show higher tenacity and lower ductility than fibers from DMT. X-ray diffraction, density, and birefringence measurements indicate that, for the fibers from the DMT process, an earlier crystallization occurs which prevents the progress of the orientation of the amorphous phase. The lower molecular orientation in the amorphous phase of the fibers from DMT, in turn, accounts for their lower tenacity. The earlier crystallization of the fibers from DMT would be related to their slightly higher melting temperatures and melt viscosities, which could be due to the lower amount of constitutional defects (diethylene glycol content) in the considered PET samples from DMT compared with those from TPA.

40|$|Abstract: Taguchi Method is {{explained}} in brief {{and one of}} the textile processes, called spinning process, is optimised by using Taguchi method for manufacturing optimum packing density of different technologies yarns. The effect of process variables like: lap hank, card draft, draft/doublings and drafts at speed frame, ring frame, rotor and air-jet <b>spinning</b> ma-chine on <b>packing</b> density parameters of respective technology yarn was analysed. The effect of noise variables was also accounted for. The trends of change in packing density with process variables are opposite to those of yarn diameter and helix angle of ring, rotor and air-jet yarns studied. The packing density is found to be the highest in air-jet yarn and the lowest in rotor yarn. Increase in draft in air-jet spinner and decrease in rotor spinner increase packing density of the re-spective yarns. The change in noise variables does affect the packing density parameters of yarns. Result analysis using Taguchi Method was according to the perception of some of the previous researcher on the subject. Hence, Taguchi method can be also used to optimise a textile process, where the product quality is highly variable and dependent on the combination of number of processes as well as on machine parameters...|$|R
40|$|Electron {{paramagnetic}} resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is {{an important}} technology in physics, chemistry, materials science, and biology. Sensitive detection with a small sample volume is a key objective in these areas, because it is crucial, for example, for the readout of a highly <b>packed</b> <b>spin</b> based quantum memory or the detection of unlabeled metalloproteins in a single cell. In conventional EPR spectrometers, the energy transfer from the spins to the cavity at a Purcell enhanced rate plays an essential role and requires the spins to be resonant with the cavity, however {{the size of the}} cavity (limited by the wavelength) makes it difficult to improve the spatial resolution. Here, we demonstrate a novel EPR spectrometer using a single artificial atom as a sensitive detector of spin magnetization. The artificial atom, a superconducting flux qubit, provides advantages both in terms of its quantum properties and its much stronger coupling with magnetic fields. We have achieved a sensitivity of ∼ 400 spins/√(Hz) with a magnetic sensing volume around 10 ^- 14 λ^ 3 (50 femto-liters). This corresponds to an improvement of two-order of magnitude in the magnetic sensing volume compared with the best cavity based spectrometers while maintaining a similar sensitivity as those spectrometers. Our artificial atom is suitable for scaling down and thus paves the way for measuring single spins on the nanometer scale...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, we {{introduce}} several new, architectures for {{quantum computing}} under restricted control. We consider two specific cases of restricted control; systems in which local control of individual qubits is impossible, and systems in which qubits are {{connected by a}} probabilistic entangling mechanism. First we will- consider densely <b>packed</b> <b>spin</b> chains and introduce a novel scheme for performing universal quantum computing within this system using only global control. Global control avoids local manipulation of individual qubits, using instead identical operations on each qubit. We present an experimental demonstration of this scheme using NMR techniques. Next we propose an architecture for implementing fault-tolerant computation using only global control. We will consider a chain consisting of repeating patterns of three distinct species. The structure of this chain allows error correction to be performed in parallel. We describe the necessary operations required to construct a universal set of fault-tolerant operations, and prove {{the existence of a}} fault-tolerance threshold. vVe finish our discussion of global control {{with a look at the}} ultimate limits of control within quantum systems. We describe a technique for calculating an upper bound on the number of accessible qubits within any quantum system, and derive upper bounds on the number of usable qubits in a range of spin networks. Next we will propose an architecture for distributed quantum computing using linear optics to generate entanglement between matter qubits. Using the graph state formalism we show that such entanglement can be generated in a deterministic manner when linking systems consisting of coupled pairs of qubits. vVe finish our discussion of distributed quantum computing by presenting an algorithm for reducing the number of qubits required to implement a graph state calculation. This algorithm efficiently removes redundant qubits from the measurement pattcrn used to perform the computation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
