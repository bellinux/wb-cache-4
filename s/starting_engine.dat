60|$|Babbitt moaned; turned over; {{struggled}} {{back toward}} his dream. He {{could see only}} her face now, beyond misty waters. The furnace-man slammed the basement door. A dog barked in the next yard. As Babbitt sank blissfully into a dim warm tide, the paper-carrier went by whistling, and the rolled-up Advocate thumped the front door. Babbitt roused, his stomach constricted with alarm. As he relaxed, he was pierced by the familiar and irritating rattle of some one cranking a Ford: snap-ah-ah, snap-ah-ah, snap-ah-ah. Himself a pious motorist, Babbitt cranked with the unseen driver, with him waited through taut hours for {{the roar of the}} <b>starting</b> <b>engine,</b> with him agonized as the roar ceased and again began the infernal patient snap-ah-ah--a round, flat sound, a shivering cold-morning sound, a sound infuriating and inescapable. Not till the rising voice of the motor told him that the Ford was moving was he released from the panting tension. He glanced once at his favorite tree, elm twigs against the gold patina of sky, and fumbled for sleep as for a drug. He who had been a boy very credulous of life was no longer greatly interested in the possible and improbable adventures of each new day.|$|E

50|$|From the mid 1870s his {{interests}} began to drift towards marine engineering. He then invented the combine hydraulic/steam <b>starting</b> <b>engine,</b> common in all steamships thereafter, and the highly innovative steam-tiller (a forerunner of all power-steering devices). Around 1872 he invented the telemotor a mechanism allowing removal {{of most of}} the complex gears and chains between the control room and the engine on steamships. In 1874 he invented the Steam accumulator. He used this device to power further odd creations to load and unloads cargoes using steam-power.He provided the steering gear for both the SS Lusitania and SS Mauritania.|$|E
50|$|The Tornado had steam cooling; {{water in}} the {{cylinder}} jackets was allowed to come to boiling point, and then condensed in three small triangular radiators on the hull above the power cars, or for the two midships engines was condensed in a retractable radiator and used to heat the passenger accommodation. Running the engines at a relatively high thermal temperature was expected to improve the specific fuel consumption. The Tornado engines used Ricardo petrol starting engines, and there had only been time to replace one with a Beverley heavy-oil <b>starting</b> <b>engine</b> (itself started by compressed air) on one Tornado.|$|E
5000|$|The {{air filter}} {{was of a}} {{washable}} oil bath type, the centrifugal Engine oil filter only required washing out rather than replacing, whilst the hydraulic and fuel filters were also of a washable design until the 1990s.Until recently the tractors had either an air or liquid-cooled engine with a 4-cylinder diesel being the most common configuration, while larger 6-cylinder and articulated models were available.A variety of methods were used to start the engines depending on the model. A 24-volt electric starter motors was most common on export models and for use in less rural locations where replacement batteries were more easily obtainable. A diesel, kerosene or petrol 2-stroke <b>starting</b> <b>engine</b> was {{more common in the}} Eastern bloc countries due to them being more reliable in the colder winters and batteries being expensive or simply unobtainable. Various adaptations to the tractor have also been made to aid starting in cold weather, including a lever to disconnect the hydraulic pump.The three-point hitch is operated by a hydraulic cylinder, {{and is one of the}} few tractor designs that can apply [...] "Down Pressure" [...] with the three-point hitch.|$|E

Based on {{the vehicle}} dynamic {{equation}} in <b>starting</b> <b>engine</b> in-motion process for HEV, theoretical derivation is conducted {{to obtain the}} impact hardness equation in the process. By using matlab/simulink, the law of influence the parameters have on the impact hardness equation is analyzed.

At last a test bed of the <b>starting</b> <b>engine</b> in-motion for HEV is implemented. The test {{results show that the}} change rate of clutch pressure, motor torque and engine torque, can effectively coordinate the change relation between the clutch pressure, the motor torque, and the engine torque.

40|$|Abstract: There is a {{worldwide}} effort in using {{more and more}} electrical-driven auxiliaries in road vehicles. The integrated starter-alternator (ISA) is an electric drive in which the functions of <b>starting</b> <b>engine</b> and generating electric power are fulﬁlled by only one electric machine, instead of two separate electric machines in a traditional automotive vehicle. The interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous machines are attractive for the ISA application thanks to their characteristics: the ﬂux-weakening capability, the high efﬁciency, the high power density and the high overload capability. This study reports some analysis and test results of an ISA that has been developed using a fractional-slot IPM machine. The results conﬁrm that the IPM machine conﬁguration is an excellent candidate for this application...|$|E
