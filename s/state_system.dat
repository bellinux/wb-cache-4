Later, Batou tells a recovering Kusanagi that the real Tateaki Koshiki used a cybernetic body and built the Solid State after he was hired by Munei. Kusanagi does not reveal that the Puppeteer was a fragment of herself, but Batou already knew from being linked to her during the dive. Batou concludes that the ultimate identity of the Puppeteer will remain unknown and that incident will be written off as a scandal.|$|E

5|$|A varsity {{baseball}} team is an established part {{of physical education}} departments at most high schools and colleges in the United States. In 2008, {{nearly half a million}} high schoolers and over 35,000 collegians played on their schools' {{baseball team}}s. The number of Americans participating in baseball has declined since the late 1980s, falling well behind the number of soccer participants. By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan's leading sport. Today, high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there. The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring, and the even more important National High School Baseball Championship in the summer—are broadcast around the country. The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played. In Cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the <b>state</b> <b>system</b> of physical education, which begins at age six. Talented children as young as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team.|$|E

25|$|Talk of U of L {{joining the}} public {{university}} system of Kentucky {{began in the}} 1960s. As a municipally funded school (meaning funding only came {{from the city of}} Louisville), the movement of people to the suburbs of Louisville created budget shortfalls for the school and forced tuition prices to levels unaffordable for most students. At the same time, the school's well established medicine and law schools were seen as assets for the <b>state</b> <b>system.</b> Still, there was opposition to U of L becoming public, both from faculty and alumni who feared losing the small, close-knit feel of the campus, and from universities already in the <b>state</b> <b>system</b> who feared funding cuts. After several years of heated debate, the university joined the <b>state</b> <b>system</b> in 1970, a move largely orchestrated by then Kentucky governor and U of L alumnus Louie Nunn.|$|E
40|$|Global {{and local}} model {{checking}} procedures follow rad-ically different paradigms: while global approaches {{are based on}} fixpoint computation, local approaches are re-lated to deduction and induction. For the verification of fi-nite <b>state</b> <b>systems,</b> this may result in different runtimes. For the verification of infinite <b>state</b> <b>systems,</b> however, the differ-ences are far more important. Since most problems are un-decidable for such systems, {{it may be the}} case that one of the procedures does not terminate. In this paper, we compare global and local procedures for model checking µ-calculus properties of infinite <b>state</b> <b>systems.</b> In particular, we show how they can benefit from each other and present appropri-ate extensions. 1...|$|R
40|$|Automatic {{verification}} of infinite <b>state</b> <b>systems</b> {{is an important}} area of research. Unlike its finite state counterpart, {{in spite of the}} existence of a large body of theoretical and practical results on automatic {{verification of}} infinite <b>state</b> <b>systems,</b> there does not exist a uniform framework that is applicable to a large class of systems and that facilitates description of procedures that solves the verification problem for infinite <b>state</b> <b>systems</b> in practice as well as providing tools for reasoning about the termination conditions of such procedures. The purpose of this dissertation is to provide a uniform framework that (1) allows description of infinite <b>state</b> <b>systems</b> at their own level of granularity, (2) allows specifying their properties at a high level, (3) allows description of procedures, that can solve in practice the verification problems for infinite <b>state</b> <b>systems,</b> in a declarative fashion, (4) provides tools to reason about the termination conditions for such procedures, (5) facilitates derivation of abstractions for verification as well as easy incorporation of optimization techniques, (6) allows clear separation of the logical aspects of verification from the combinatorial ones, (7) allows combination of deductive (proof-theoretic) methods with model-theoretic ones and (8) provides, for free, data structures for implicit representation of possibly infinite sets of states...|$|R
