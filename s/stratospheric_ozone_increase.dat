40|$|Vertical and {{latitudinal}} {{changes in}} the stratospheric ozone in the post-chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) era are investigated using simulations of the recent past and the 21 st century with a coupled chemistry-climate model. Model results reveal that, in the 2060 s when the stratospheric halogen loading is projected to return to its 1980 values, the extratropical column ozone is significantly higher than that in 1975 - 1984, but the tropical column ozone does not recover to 1980 values. Upper and lower stratospheric ozone {{changes in the}} post- CFC era have very different patterns. Above 15 hPa ozone increases almost latitudinally uniformly by 6 Dobson Unit (DU), whereas below 15 hPa ozone decreases in the tropics by 8 DU and increases in the extratropics by up to 16 DU. The upper <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>increase</b> is a photochemical response to greenhouse gas induced strong cooling, and the lower stratospheric ozone changes are consistent with enhanced mean advective transport due to a stronger Brewer-Dobson circulation. The model {{results suggest that the}} strengthening of the Brewer-Dobson circulation plays a crucial role in ozone recovery and ozone distributions in the post-CFC era...|$|E
40|$|The {{vertical}} profile of global-mean stratospheric temperature changes has traditionally represented an important diagnostic for the attribution of the cooling effects of stratospheric ozone depletion and CO 2 increases. However, CO 2 -induced cooling alters ozone abundance by perturbing ozone chemistry, thereby coupling the stratospheric ozone and temperature responses {{to changes in}} CO 2 and ozone-depleting substances (ODSs). Here we untangle the ozone-temperature coupling and show that the attribution of global-mean stratospheric temperature changes to CO 2 and ODS changes (which are the true anthropogenic forcing agents) can be {{quite different from the}} traditional attribution to CO 2 and ozone changes. The significance of these effects is quantified empirically using simulations from a three-dimensional chemistry-climate model. The results confirm the essential validity of the traditional approach in attributing changes during the past period of rapid ODS increases, although we find that about 10 % of the upper stratospheric ozone decrease from ODS increases over the period 1975 – 1995 was offset by the increase in CO 2, and the CO 2 -induced cooling in the upper stratosphere has been somewhat overestimated. When considering ozone recovery, however, the ozone-temperature coupling is a first-order effect; fully 2 / 5 of the upper <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>increase</b> projected to occur from 2010 – 2040 is attributable to CO 2 increases. Thus, it has now become necessary to base attribution of global-mean stratospheric temperature changes on CO 2 and ODS changes rather than on CO 2 and ozone changes...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of ozone from 1960 to 2100 is examined in simulations from fourteen chemistry-climate models. There is general {{agreement among the}} models at the broadest levels, with all showing column ozone decreasing at all latitudes from 1960 to around 2000, then increasing at all latitudes over {{the first half of}} the 21 st century (21 C), and latitudinal variations in the rate of increase and date of return to historical values. In the second half of the century, ozone is projected to carry on increasing, level off or even decrease depending on the latitude, resulting in variable dates of return to historical values at latitudes where column ozone has declined below those levels. Separation into partial column above and below 20 hPa reveals that these latitudinal differences are almost completely due to differences in the lower stratosphere. At all latitudes, upper stratospheric ozone increases throughout the 21 C and returns to 1960 levels before the end of the century, although there is a spread among the models in dates that ozone returns to historical values. Using multiple linear regression the upper <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>increase</b> comes from almost equal contributions due to decrease in halogens and cooling from increased greenhouse gas concentrations. The {{evolution of}} lower stratospheric ozone differs with latitude. In the tropical lower stratosphere an increase in tropical upwelling causes a steady decrease in ozone through the 21 C, and total column ozone does not return to 1960 levels in all models. In contrast, lower stratospheric and total column ozone in middle and high latitudes increases during the 21 C and returns to 1960 levels. For all models there is an earlier return for ozone to historical levels in the northern hemisphere. This is thought to be due to interhemispheric differences in transport...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{evolution}} of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> from 1960 to 2100 is examined in simulations from 14 chemistry-climate models, driven by prescribed levels of halogens and greenhouse gases. There is general {{agreement among the}} models that total column ozone reached a minimum around year 2000 at all latitudes, projected {{to be followed by}} an increase over {{the first half of the}} 21 st century. In the second half of the 21 st century, ozone is projected to continue increasing, level off, or even decrease depending on the latitude. Separation into partial columns above and below 20 hPa reveals that these latitudinal differences are almost completely caused by differences in the model projections of ozone in the lower stratosphere. At all latitudes, upper <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>increases</b> throughout the 21 st century and is projected to return to 1960 levels well before the end of the century, although there is a spread among models in the dates that ozone returns to specific historical values.

40|$|Long-term {{changes in}} the {{composition}} of the atmosphere are known to have significant effects on atmospheric chemistry and <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone.</b> <b>Increasing</b> levels of greenhouse gases have the potential to change the global climate in the middle and upper atmospheres, {{as well as in the}} troposphere.

In order to understand and predict the consequences of these changes, and of control measures such as the Montreal Protocol, it is necessary to understand the complex interactions between radiation, chemistry, and dynamics in the atmosphere. Much of the uncertainty in our understanding of atmospheric processes comes from an incomplete understanding of atmospheric transport. A complete and self-consistent model of transport requires not only an understanding of trace-species transport, but also the transport of dynamically active quantities such as heat and potential vorticity.

40|$|Chemistry {{climate models}} (CCMs) {{are used to}} predict the future {{evolution}} of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> as ozone-depleting substances decrease and greenhouse gases increase, cooling the stratosphere. CCM predictions exhibit many common features, but also a broad range of values for quantities such as year of ozone-return-to- 1980 and global ozone level {{at the end of the}} 21 st century. Multiple linear regression is applied to each of 14 CCMs to separate ozone response to chlorine change from that due to climate change. We show that the sensitivity of lower atmosphere ozone to chlorine change deltaO 3 /deltaCly is a near linear function of partitioning of total inorganic chlorine (Cly) into its reservoirs; both Cly and its partitioning are controlled by lower atmospheric transport. CCMs with realistic transport agree with observations for chlorine reservoirs and produce similar ozone responses to chlorine change. After 2035 differences in response to chlorine contribute little to the spread in CCM results as the anthropogenic contribution to Cly becomes unimportant. Differences among upper <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>increases</b> due to temperature decreases are explained by differences in ozone sensitivity to temperature change deltaO 3 /deltaT due to different contributions from various ozone loss processes, each with their own temperature dependence.

In this study, we examine the implications of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> recovery for the tropospheric chemistry and ozone air quality with a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). With a full recovery of the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> the projected <b>increases</b> in <b>ozone</b> column range from 1 % over the low latitudes to more than 10 % over the polar regions.

40|$|Physical {{injury is}} common in {{terrestrial}} plants {{as a result of}} grazing, harvesting, trampling, and extreme weather events. Previous studies demonstrated enhanced emission of non-microbial CH 4 under aerobic conditions from plant tissues when they were exposed to increasing UV radiation and temperature. Since physical injury is also a form of environmental stress, we sought to determine whether it would also affect CH 4 emissions from plants. Physical injury (cutting) stimulated CH 4 emission from fresh twigs of Artemisia species under aerobic conditions. More cutting resulted in more CH 4 emissions. Hypoxia also enhanced CH 4 emission from both uncut and cut Artemisia frigida twigs. Physical injury typically results in cell wall degradation, which may either stimulate formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or decrease scavenging of them. Increased ROS activity might explain increased CH 4 emission in response to physical injury and other forms of stress. There were significant differences in CH 4 emissions among 10 species of Artemisia, with some species emitting no detectable CH 4 under any circumstances. Consequently, CH 4 emissions may be species-dependent and therefore difficult to estimate in nature based on total plant biomass. Our results and those of previous studies suggest that a variety of environmental stresses stimulate CH 4 emission {{from a wide variety of}} plant species. Global change processes, including climate change, depletion of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> <b>increasing</b> ground-level <b>ozone,</b> spread of plant pests, and land-use changes, could cause more stress in plants on a global scale, potentially stimulating more CH 4 emission globally...|$|R
40|$|Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) {{are being}} {{developed}} as replacements for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that deplete <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone.</b> The depletion of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> may <b>increase</b> the intensity of ultraviolet radiation at the earth's surface, which {{may be associated with}} global, adverse human health effects. The greater tropospheric lability of HCFCs, which is due to the presence of C-H bonds, reduces HCFC migration to the stratosphere; HCFCs should, therefore, cause less depletion of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> than CFCs. HCFCs under development include HCFC- 22 (chlorodifluoromethane), HCFC- 123 (2, 2 -dichloro- 1, 1, 1 -trifluoroethane), HCFC- 132 b (1, 2 -dichloro- 1, 1 -difluoroethane), HCFC- 134 a (1, 1, 1, 2 -tetrafluoroethane), HCFC- 141 b (1, 1 -dichloro- 1 -fluoroethane, and HCFC- 142 b (1 -chloro- 1, 1 -difluoroethane). With the exception of HCFC- 22, which is already in use, the metabolism and toxicity of HCFCs have not been studied in detail. By analogy to chlorinated ethanes, predictions can be made about the possible metabolism of HCFCs, but there are insufficient data available to predict rates of metabolism. Although most HCFCs appear to show low acute toxicity, some HCFCs are mutagenic in the Ames test.

40|$|It is well-understood that {{reductions}} in air quality {{play a significant}} role in both environmental and human health. Interactions between ozone depletion and global climate change will significantly alter atmospheric chemistry which, in turn, will cause changes in concentrations of natural and human-made gasses and aerosols. Models predict that tropospheric ozone near the surface will increase globally by up to 10 to 30 ppbv (33 to 100 % increase) during the period 2000 to 2100. With the increase in the amount of the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> <b>increased</b> transport from the stratosphere to the troposphere will result in different responses in polluted and unpolluted areas. In contrast, global changes in tropospheric hydroxyl radical (OH) are not predicted to be large, except where influenced by the presence of oxidizable organic matter, such as from large-scale forest fires. Recent measurements in a relatively clean location over 5 years showed that OH concentrations can be predicted by the intensity of solar ultraviolet radiation. If this relationship is confirmed by further observations, this approach could be used to simplify assessments of air quality. Analysis of surface-level ozone observations in Antarctica suggests that there has been a significant change in the chemistry of the boundary layer of the atmosphere in this region as a result of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion. The oxidation potential of the Antarctic boundary layer is estimated to be greater now than before the development of the ozone hole. Recent modeling studies have suggested that iodine and iodine-containing substances from natural sources, such as the ocean, may <b>increase</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion significantly in polar regions during spring. Given the uncertainty of the fate of iodine in the stratosphere, the results may also be relevant for <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion and measurements of the influence of these substances on ozone depletion should be considered in the future. In agreement with known usage and atmospheric loss processes, tropospheric concentrations of HFC- 134 a, the main human-made source of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), is increasing rapidly. As HFC- 134 a is a potent greenhouse gas; this increasing concentration has implications for climate change. However, the risks to humans and the environment from substances, such as TFA, produced by atmospheric degradation of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are considered minimal. Perfluoropolyethers, commonly used as industrial heat transfer fluids and proposed as chloro-hydrofluorocarbon (CHFC) substitutes, show great stability to chemical degradation in the atmosphere. These substances have been suggested as substitutes for CHFCs but, as they are very persistent in the atmosphere, they may be important contributors to global warming.

40|$|The UV {{components}} of sunlight {{are believed to}} be a major cause of human skin cancer, and DNA is thought to be the principal molecular target. Alterations of the intensity and wavelength distribution of solar UV radiation reaching the surface of the earth, for example by depletion of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> will change the effectiveness of solar radiation in damaging DNA in human skin. Evaluation of the magnitude of such effects requires knowledge of the altered sunlight spectrum and of the action spectrum for damaging DNA in human skin. We have determined an action spectrum for the frequency of pyrimidine dimer formation induced in the DNA of human skin per unit dose of UV incident on the skin surface. The peak of this action spectrum is near 300 nm and decreases rapidly at both longer and shorter wavelengths. The decrease in our action spectrum for wavelengths less than 300 nm is attributed to the absorption of the upper layers of the skin, an in situ effect that is inherently included in our measurements. Convolution of the dimer action spectrum with the solar spectra corresponding to a solar angle of 40 degrees under current levels of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> (0. 32 -cm O 3 layer) and those for 50 % ozone depletion (0. 16 -cm O 3 layer), indicate about a 2. 5 -fold increase in dimer formation.

After the warming, the polar vortex split into two weaker vortices. The zonal mean temperature in the polar upper stratosphere (35 – 45 km) increased by approximately 25 K in a few days, while there was a decrease in temperature in the lower stratosphere and mesosphere. Local temperature maxima were around 325 K in the upper stratosphere and minima around 175 and 155 K in the lower stratosphere and mesosphere, respectively. In this study, we present middle atmospheric water vapor and ozone measurements obtained by a meridional chain of European ground-based microwave radiometers in Bern (47 &deg; N), Onsala (57 &deg; N) and Sodankylä (67 &deg; N). The instruments in Bern and Onsala are part of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC). Effects of the SSW were observed at all three locations and we perform a combined analysis in order to reveal transport processes in the middle atmosphere above Europe during the SSW event. Further we investigate the chemical and dynamical influences of the SSW event. We find that the anomalies during the warming in water vapor and ozone were different for each location. A few days before the beginning of the major SSW, we observed a decrease in mesospheric water vapor above Bern, which we attribute to movement of the mesospheric polar vortex towards Central Europe. The most prominent H 2 O anomaly observed in Bern was an increase in stratospheric water vapor during the warming. In Onsala and Sodankylä, mesospheric water vapor increased within a few days during the warming and slowly decreased afterwards. Upper <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> decreased during the warming over Bern by approximately 30 % and by approximately 20 % over Onsala.

40|$|Through the 21 st century, {{anthropogenic}} emissions {{of the greenhouse}} gases N 2 O and CH 4 are projected to increase, thus increasing their atmospheric concentrations. Consequently, reactive nitrogen species produced from N 2 O and reactive hydrogen species produced from CH 4 are expected to play an increasingly important role in determining <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations. Eight chemistry-climate model simulations were performed to assess the sensitivity of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> to different emissions scenarios for N 2 O and CH 4. Global-mean total column <b>ozone</b> <b>increases</b> through the 21 st century in all eight simulations {{as a result of}} CO 2 -induced stratospheric cooling and decreasing stratospheric halogen concentrations. Larger N 2 O concentrations were associated with smaller <b>ozone</b> <b>increases,</b> due to reactive nitrogen-mediated ozone destruction. In the simulation with the largest N 2 O increase, global-mean total column <b>ozone</b> <b>increased</b> by 4. 3 DU through the 21 st century, compared with 10. 0 DU in the simulation with the smallest N 2 O increase.

40|$|Geoengineering with stratospheric sulfate {{aerosols}} {{has been}} proposed {{as a means of}} temporarily cooling the planet, alleviating some of the side effects of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. However, one of the known side effects of stratospheric injections of sulfate aerosols is a decrease in <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone.</b> Here we show results from two general circulation models and two coupled chemistry climate models that have simulated stratospheric sulfate aerosol geoengineering as part of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP). Changes in photolysis rates and upwelling of ozone-poor air in the tropics reduce <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> suppression of the NOx cycle <b>increases</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> and an <b>increase</b> in available surfaces for heterogeneous chemistry modulates reductions in ozone. On average, the models show a factor 20 - 40 increase of the sulfate aerosol surface area density (SAD) at 50 hPa in the tropics with respect to unperturbed background conditions and a factor 3 - 10 increase at mid-high latitudes. The net effect for a tropical injection rate of 5 Tg SO 2 per year is a decrease in globally averaged ozone by 1. 1 - 2. 1 DU in the years 2040 - 2050 for three models which include heterogeneous chemistry on the sulfate aerosol surfaces. GISS-E 2 -R, a fully coupled general circulation model, performed simulations with no heterogeneous chemistry and a smaller aerosol size; it showed a decrease in ozone by 9. 7 DU. After the year 2050, suppression of the NOx cycle becomes more important than destruction of ozone by ClOx, causing an <b>increase</b> in total <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone.</b> Contribution of ozone changes in this experiment to radiative forcing is 0. 23 W m- 2 in GISS-E 2 -R and less than 0. 1 W m- 2 in the other three models. Polar ozone depletion, due to enhanced formation of both sulfate aerosol SAD and polar stratospheric clouds, results in an average 5 percent increase in calculated surface UV-B...|$|R

40|$|This {{analysis}} revisits {{detection and}} attribution of free atmosphere temperatures from radiosondes, {{almost a decade}} after previous studies. Since that time, data sets have not only become longer, but understanding of observational uncertainty has vastly improved. In addition, a coordinated set of experiments exploring the effects of human and natural forcings on past climate change has been made with {{a new generation of}} climate models. These advances allow a much more thorough analysis of the effects of modeling and observational uncertainty on attribution results than previously possible. Observational uncertainty is explored using multiple radiosonde reconstructions including those with ensembles of realizations exploring the effects of processing choices. Modeling uncertainty is explored by calculating multiple fingerprints of natural influence (from changes in solar irradiance and volcanic aerosols) and of human influence (due to greenhouse gases and due to the effects of combined anthropogenic forcings including <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion). With <b>increased</b> confidence over previous studies, human influences (both greenhouse gas and other anthropogenic forcings) have been detected in spatiotemporal changes in free atmosphere temperature from 1961 to 2010, irrespective of whether the full atmospheric column (30 – 850 [*]hPa) is examined or purely the troposphere, with <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion dominating the cooling that has been observed in the lower stratosphere. Thus the advances of the last decade yield increased confidence that anthropogenic influences have made a substantial contribution to the evolution of free atmosphere temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Astrophysical {{ionizing}} radiation {{events such as}} supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and solar proton events have been recognized as a potential threat to life on Earth, primarily through depletion of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> and subsequent <b>increase</b> in solar UV radiation at Earth's surface and in the upper levels of the ocean. Other work has also considered {{the potential impact of}} nitric acid rainout, concluding that no significant threat is likely. Not yet studied to-date is the potential impact of ozone produced in the lower atmosphere following an {{ionizing radiation}} event. Ozone is a known irritant to organisms on land and in water and therefore may be a significant additional hazard. Using previously completed atmospheric chemistry modeling we have examined the amount of ozone produced in the lower atmosphere for the case of a gamma-ray burst and find that the values are too small to pose a significant additional threat to the biosphere. These results may be extended to other ionizing radiation events, including supernovae and extreme solar proton events. Comment: Accepted for publication in Astrobiolog...|$|R
40|$|Decrease in <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> {{absorption}} and <b>increase</b> in oxygen absorption with decreasing wavelength {{combine to}} produce a window of maximum atmospheric transmission near 210 nm. Since solar radiation in this spectral region dissociates molecular oxygen, the deep atmospheric penetration at this wavelength is of particular aeronomical interest. High resolution calculations of the transmittance down to 28. 65 km were made for the 200 - 243 -nm spectral range in this window region, {{in support of a}} stratospheric balloon flight from Fort Churchill in July 1974. The calculations were made by dividing the atmosphere into layers which were chosen so that each could be assumed homogeneous; optical depths were calculated separately for each of these layers and then summed to obtain the over-all transmittance of the atmosphere. Absorption by molecular oxygen (line and continuum) and by ozone was included, as well as extinction through Rayleigh scattering by air molecules. The calculated transmittances were combined with high altitude (above 100 -km) rocket measurements of the sun-center spectrum and center-to-limb variations to give residual high resolution solar spectral flux for several altitudes and solar zenith angles...|$|R
40|$|Networks of {{ground-based}} {{and satellite}} borne instruments to measure ultraviolet (UV) sunlight and total column ozone have greatly {{contributed to an}} understanding of increased amounts of UV reaching the surface of the Earth caused by <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion. <b>Increased</b> UV radiation has important potential effects on human health, and agricultural and ecological systems. Observations from these networks make it possible to monitor total ozone decreases and to predict ozone recovery trends due to global efforts to curb the use of products releasing chemicals harmful to the ozone layer. Thus, continued and expanded global monitoring of ozone and UV is needed. However, existing automatic <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> monitors are complex and expensive instruments. The main objective of this research was the development of a low-cost fully automated total column ozone monitoring instrument which, because of its affordability, will increase the number of instruments available for ground-based observations. The new instrument is based on a high-resolution fiber optic spectrometer, coupled with fiber optics that are precisely aimed by a pan and tilt positioning mechanism and with controlling programs written in commonly available software platforms which run on a personal computer. This project makes use of novel low-cost fiber optic spectrometer technology. A cost advantage is gained over available units by placing one end of the fiber outdoors to collect sunlight and convey it indoors, thereby allowing the spectrometer and computer to be placed in a controlled environment. This reduces the cost of weatherproofing and thermal compensation. Cost savings also result from a simplified sun targeting system, because only a small pan and tilt device is required to aim the lightweight fiber optic ends. Precision sun-targeting algorithms, optical filter selection, and software to derive ozone from spectral measurements by the spectrometer are a major contribution of this project. This system is a flexible platform which may be adapted to study other atmospheric constituents such as sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, and haze...|$|R

40|$|The brown {{macroalga}} Saccharina latissima (Linnaeus) C. E. Lane, C. Mayes, Druehl & G. W. Saunders (formerly Laminaria saccharina [L. ] Lamouroux) {{was exposed}} to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in the mW UV-A and mW UV-B range in the laboratory for up to 28 days. The release rates of volatile organohalogens, such as chloroform, bromoform, dibromomethane and methyl iodide, were determined. From these rates, the total emission of reactive organic halogens was calculated. The results revealed that exposure to UVR significantly affected the emission of reactive organic halogens by the macroalga under investigation. An increase in the release of reactive organic iodine was observed for the algal species. In contrast, for reactive organic bromine and reactive organic chlorine, a decrease in emission by the macroalga was observed. Apparently, the potential for increased levels of UVR resulting from further ongoing destruction of the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> layer may <b>increase</b> the importance of marine macroalgae in atmospheric reactions involving organic halogens.
