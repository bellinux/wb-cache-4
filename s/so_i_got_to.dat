500|$|Just prior of {{the casting}} call and video shoot, Stansberry {{expressed}} his views to MTV News {{on the concept}} for the video – originality. [...] "Originality, being you. This song is about being who you want. It's about letting loose. There's no explanation. This is this underground video, this underground party." [...] During the video shoot, MTV interviewed Lopez about the concepts for the video. Lopez described some of the characters she played, telling MTV that in one scene [...] "I play one character where she kind of runs this party, acts like she's kind of over it, {{but at the same}} time loves it and loves this kind of underground kind of party dance culture,... <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be wild and crazy, and at the same time I got to be sexy and sweet too." [...] The video makes use of product placement, including BMW, Swarovski and Crown Royal, according to Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly. Stransky also noted the [...] "unintentional placement" [...] of fake eyelashes and wigs, weaves, and other hair-extending products.|$|E
500|$|She began {{performing}} at age six {{when she was}} cast in the lead singing role of [...] "Little Star" [...] in the Christmas play at her school, Fendalton Open Air School. After the show, a teacher who had watched the performance approached her parents {{to tell them that}} their daughter was [...] "pitch perfect". The teacher encouraged Westenra to learn how to play a musical instrument; Hayley soon after learned to read music and play the violin, piano, guitar, and recorder. She then began voice lessons and discovered a passion for musical theatre. By age 11, she had performed more than 40 times on stage, but was often given male parts: [...] "I got boy parts quite often. In ballet, there were not enough boys. So they ended up choosing half and half. I got chosen to wear the grey suit and the wig, and not the pretty dresses. In A Christmas Carol, I was Tiny Tim, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be quite a sick, sick boy. There was a severe lack of singing boys and, at the time, it was quite disappointing." [...] Westenra attended Cobham Intermediate School in 1998 and 1999, where a performing arts building was later named in her honour. She won a talent quest in her first year (Year 9) at Burnside High School, which she attended from 2000 to 2003.|$|E
2500|$|... "We were like, [...] "Yeah, okay!” My dad {{took me to}} a {{pawn shop}} and got me a Sears Roebuck guitar with a little {{matching}} amp. That was my first rig -- a complete and total thrill. Jean and I flipped a coin to see who would play bass in the band. (laughs) I won, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> stay on guitar. We learned to play by listening to the radio and by hanging out with boys who were in bands. We were 15 or 16 at the time.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, that's for you. Will says that, {{if you are}} to be an army surgeon, {{you must}} have a green band on your arm; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> this <b>to</b> tie on when we play hospital." ...|$|R

2500|$|Aguilera's Grammy Award nominations, two {{back to back}} number-one singles, {{magazine}} gossip, and merchandise released {{under her}} name made her the [...] "It girl", according to People. In March 2000, Lori Majewski, entertainment director at Teen People magazine, stated: [...] "If {{people want to know}} why Christina is going to be around a decade from now, the answer is very clear: It's pure talent," [...] Majewski said. [...] "When you hear this girl open her mouth, everyone is astounded. I've seen her sing many times, and every time, I'm impressed, but the people who are hearing {{it for the first time}} can't even believe it." [...] In an article about the [...] "2013 Most Influential People in the World", in which Aguilera appeared, Canadian singer-songwriter Céline Dion claimed that, [...] "I remember she broke onto the scene at the turn of the millennium, [...] <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> watch a lot of her TV appearances, especially on the award shows. I remember thinking, This girl's got it all and then some! Unbelievable voice, great dancer and so very beautiful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] I says, [...] "it's a rough gang, {{them two}} frauds, and I'm fixed <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> travel {{with them a}} while longer, whether I want to or not--I druther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would {{get me out of}} their claws, and I'd be all right; but there'd be another person that you don't know about who'd be in big trouble. Well, we got to save HIM, hain't we? Of course. Well, then, we won't blow on them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard you}} {{coming down the}} hill, though you came so softly," [...] he said; [...] "but I could not tell who it was, because you jumped from rock to rock and did not walk as usual. But I {{thought it was a}} woman with boots; I could not see, because the light all falls dead against the hill, and the stars are not up. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the left of your path--for the wind is blowing from the right--and waited till you had passed and winded you. Then I knew who you were for certain--either you or Missie Bessie; but Missie Bessie is shut up, so it could not be her." ...|$|E
5000|$|There {{has been}} {{confusion}} over the pronunciation of 'Gene'. [...] "When I {{first arrived in}} England people called me Gene (Jean) and I thought it sounded quite posh, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> used <b>to</b> it, but it is Gene (Gennay), that's how it is pronounced back home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have brought}} Mr. Dewes with me," [...] {{he said at}} last. [...] "He {{wants to see you}} about the defence, you know.

6000|$|I was sleepy and tired, <b>so</b> when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{the hotel}} <b>I</b> hurriedly paid it the fifty cents it demanded (with {{approximate}} lagniappe, I assure you).

6000|$|... "No, it isn't all. We didn't meet much at first, but I got {{to walking}} {{home with her}} from some teas; and then we met at a big ball. I danced with her the whole while nearly, and--and I took her brother home--Pshaw! He was drunk; and I--well, he had got drunk {{drinking}} {{with me at the}} ball. The wine didn't touch me, but it turned his head; and I took him home; he's a drunkard, anyway. She let us in when we got to their house, and that kind of made a tie between us. She pretended to think she was under obligations to me, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> going to her house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At first I did {{not love}} you, Jude; that I own. When I first knew you I merely wanted you to love me. I did not exactly flirt with you; but that inborn craving which {{undermines}} some women's morals almost more than unbridled passion--the craving to attract and captivate, regardless of the injury it may do the man--was in me; and when I found I had caught you, I was frightened. And then--I don't know how it was--I couldn't bear to let you go--possibly to Arabella again--and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> love you, Jude. But you see, however fondly it ended, it began in the selfish and cruel wish to make your heart ache for me without letting mine ache for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|When I {{had learned}} the name and {{position}} of every visible feature of the river; when I had so mastered its shape that I could shut my eyes and trace it from St. Louis to New Orleans; when I had learned to read {{the face of the}} water as one would cull the news from the morning paper; and finally, when I had trained my dull memory to treasure up an endless array of soundings and crossing-marks, and keep fast hold of them, I judged that my education was complete: <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> tilting my cap to the side of my head, and wearing a tooth-pick in my mouth at the wheel. Mr. Bixby had his eye on these airs. One day he said-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look at that, now! I {{might have}} {{expected}} it, letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him. <b>So</b> now <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go and trapse {{all the way down}} the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that creetur's up to THIS time, as long as I couldn't seem to get any answer out of you about it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... “I knowed the parting {{would come}} hard, children—I knowed it would!” said Natty, “and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> aside <b>to</b> {{look at the}} graves by myself, and thought if I left ye the keep sake which the Major gave me, when we first parted in the woods, ye wouldn’t take it unkind, but would know that, let the old man’s body go where it might, his {{feelings}} stayed behind him.” ...|$|R
60|$|When I was {{a little}} over my anger, I must eat again, but with such loathing of the mess as I could now scarce control. Sure enough, I should have done as well to fast, for my fishes {{poisoned}} me again. I had all my first pains; my throat was so sore I could scarce swallow; I had a fit of strong shuddering, which clucked my teeth together; and there came on me that dreadful sense of illness which we have no name for either in Scots or English. I thought I should have died, and made my peace with God, forgiving all men, even my uncle and the fishers; {{and as soon as}} I had thus made up my mind to the worst, clearness came upon me: I observed the night was falling dry; my clothes were dried a good deal; truly, I was in a better case than ever before, since I had landed on the isle; and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> sleep at last, with a thought of gratitude.|$|E
60|$|What we want now is {{something}} that will commence paying immediately. We have {{got a chance to}} get into a claim where they say a tunnel has been run 150 feet, and the ledge struck. I got a horse yesterday, and went out with the Attorney-General and the claim-owner--and we tried to go to the claim by a new route, and got lost in the mountains--sunset overtook us before we found the claim--my horse got too lame to carry me, and I got down and drove him ahead of me till within four miles of town--then we sent Rice on ahead. Bunker, (whose horse was in good condition,) undertook, to lead mine, and I followed after him. Darkness shut him out from my view in less than a minute, and within the next minute I lost the road and got to wandering in the sage brush. I would find the road occasionally and then lose it again in a minute or <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Carson about nine o'clock, at night, but not by the road I traveled when I left it. The General says my horse did very well for awhile, but soon refused to lead. Then he dismounted, and had a jolly time driving both horses ahead of him and chasing them here and there through the sage brush (it does my soul good when I think of it) until he got to town, when both animals deserted him, and he cursed them handsomely and came home alone. Of course the horses went to their stables.|$|E
50|$|The {{first thing}} I ever wrote was for Newsround’s Press Packers... {{to enter a}} competition, and I won that, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go to the BBC for the day - and work at Radio Times for a day, which now of course, a decade later, I’m doing regularly, and getting paid for it! - so that sort of sparked my interest.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Lander looked relieved, and she said, as if {{a little}} surprised, [...] "I'm glad you feel that way; I should feel just <b>so,</b> myself. <b>I</b> mean to do by you just what I always said I should.

[...] "I {{know the difference between a}} gold brick and a government bond, anyhow. I believe bucking the railroad's going to pay in a year or <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> on <b>to</b> it as soon as you did, I guess, but when a feller's worn the collar as long as I have and has to live, it ain't easy to cut loose--you understand." ...|$|R

5000|$|Garner came up {{with the}} concept for the {{documentary}} during the Great Recession in 2008, while working as the assistant director for The Hangover: [...] "The country was falling apart around me, people losing their homes, people just out on their own. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> thinking: If I lost everything, what would happen? I'd probably be OK, because I have great friends and family. But what if I didn't?" ...|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with former Teen Titans writer Geoff Johns, he expressed interest in having Static {{as part of the}} team, stating, [...] "I really wanted Static on the team, but there’s so much red tape there that every time I requested it DC said 'not yet' and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> never <b>got</b> <b>to</b> have him" [...] and later stating he had plans for the character since Teen Titans #1 (vol. 3). Any obstructions were eventually resolved and Static appeared in the Terror Titans, with his Milestone continuity folded in the mainstream New Earth continuity.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw her clench her teeth, and {{the flame}} of revolt rise in her face. He drew back his gnarled fist to strike, and I was afraid, and sick at heart. I could do nothing to prevail against him. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> up <b>to</b> go, and not be witness to such indignity. But the Chauffeur laughed and {{threatened}} me with a beating if I did not stay and behold.

5000|$|Because {{of our age}} {{difference}} I didn't really {{get to know him}} because I left home at a very young age. We're eight years apart and I dropped out of school and left home when I was seventeen, so he was very small. When I finally came back to the family structure and made amends then I was always on tour. And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> discover my brother by inviting him into the band.

5000|$|I made Hell Itself {{during the}} breakup with Jane Brakhage and the {{collapse}} of my whole life, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> know quite well the streaming of the hypnagogic that’s hellish. Now the body can not only feed back its sense of being in hell but also its getting out of hell, and Hell Spit Flexion shows the way out - it’s there as crowbar to lift one out of hell toward the transformatory state - purgatory. And finally there’s a fourth state that’s fleeting. I’ve called the last part existence is song quoting Rilke, because I don’t want to presume upon the after-life and call it “Heaven.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Yankovic stated that, [...] "I {{knew there}} was a Flintstones movie coming out, and I figured that for once I'd have my song out before the actual phenomenon. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> predate the movie by seven months. I'd always wanted to do a tribute to the Flintstones because I think they're a big part of pop culture. I did a lot of research, really {{immersed}} myself in the Flintstones. I watched over 100 Flintstones episodes, because I had to not only re-familiarize myself with the characters, I had to find actual sound bites and animation from the series to use in the song and the video." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "It's me {{trying to}} explain that I'm not really quiet. I started off being quiet and that's the pigeon hole I've been stuck in all these years.

5000|$|Cole {{was born}} in Melbourne, Australia. Musically, she was {{influenced}} by her mother, a trained pianist who listened to rock artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and the Rolling Stones, and her father, who preferred Maria Callas and was a classically trained pianist and soprano. Growing up, Cole often listened to concerts such as Woodstock and the Isle of Wight Festival. She recalled of her mother: [...] "My Mum loved rock, especially guitar-driven music, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> used <b>to</b> sitting through long concerts and 10 minute guitar solos".
