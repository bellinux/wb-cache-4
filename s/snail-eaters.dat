5000|$|Dipsas indica, the Amazonian <b>snail-eater,</b> a snake species {{found in}} South America ...|$|R
50|$|Dipsas trinitatis, the Trinidad <b>snail-eater</b> from Trinidad and Tobago, has {{sometimes}} been considered a subspecies of Dipsas variegata (Dipsas variegata trinitatis).|$|R
50|$|Dipsas variegata, the {{variegated}} <b>snail-eater,</b> is a snake {{found in}} South America. It {{is reported to}} feed almost exclusively on tree snails and slugs.|$|R
5000|$|Dipsas pratti or Pratt's <b>snail-eater</b> [...] is {{a species}} of {{arboreal}} snake of the family Dipsadidae. The species is endemic to northern South America.|$|R
5000|$|Catesby's <b>snail-eater</b> (Dipsas catesbyi [...] ), also {{commonly}} known as Catesby's snail sucker, is a nocturnal species of nonvenomous snake endemic to northern South America.|$|R
50|$|The graceful <b>snail-eater</b> (Dipsas gracilis), is a non-venomous snake {{found in}} the {{northern}} part of South America (NW Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia).No subspecies are currently recognized.|$|R
50|$|Iwasaki's <b>snail-eater,</b> Pareas iwasakii, is {{a species}} of snake in the family Pareidae. The species is endemic to the Yaeyama Islands in the {{southern}} Ryukyu Islands, Japan.|$|R
60|$|<b>Snail-eater</b> was a readier man, {{and besides}} Bo {{did not fall}} forward as Siss had done, but gave at his knees and hips, crumpling up with the toothed club upon his head. The <b>Snail-eater</b> drove his spear forward swift and straight, and took Ugh-lomi in the muscle of the shoulder, and then he drove him hard with the smiting-stone in his other hand, {{shouting}} out as he did so. The new club swished ineffectually through the reeds. Eudena saw Ugh-lomi come staggering back from the narrow path into the open space, tripping over Siss and with a foot of ashen stake sticking out of him over his arm. And then the <b>Snail-eater,</b> whose name she had given, had his final injury from her, as his exultant face {{came out of the}} reeds after his spear. For she swung the first axe swift and high, and hit him fair and square on the temple; and down he went on Siss at prostrate Ugh-lomi's feet.|$|R
50|$|Dipsas indica, {{also known}} as the Neo-tropical <b>snail-eater,</b> is a snake species found in South America. It feeds on slugs and snails, which the snake can extract from their shells using its slender jaw.|$|R
50|$|The species' {{natural habitat}} is mature, closed-canopy lowland rainforest. It {{appears to be}} a specializeed <b>snail-eater.</b> The males call from {{branches}} and lianas, normally not higher than 3 metres above the ground, and can be abundant.|$|R
50|$|Protected {{species on}} {{or around the}} islands include the golden lancehead, Sauvage's <b>snail-eater</b> (Dipsas albifrons), green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), La Plata dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei), smoothback {{angelshark}} (Squatina oculata), angular angel shark (Squatina guggenheim) and royal tern (Thalasseus maximus).|$|R
60|$|In {{the morning}} before the sun had risen, Siss the Tracker, and the lad Wau-Hau, who now chipped flints, and One Eye, and Bo, and the <b>Snail-eater,</b> the two red-haired men, and Cat's-skin and Snake, all the men that were left alive of the Sons of Uya, taking their ash spears and their smiting-stones, and with throwing-stones in the beast-paw bags, started forth upon the trail of Ugh-lomi through the {{hawthorn}} thickets where Yaaa the Rhinoceros and his brothers were feeding, and up the bare downland towards the beechwoods.|$|R
60|$|To Bo {{it seemed}} the strangest thing. He had a comforting sense of tall reeds on either side, and an impregnable rampart, Siss, between him and any danger. <b>Snail-eater</b> was close behind {{and there was no}} danger there. He was {{prepared}} to shove behind and send Siss to death or victory. That was his place as second man. He saw the butt of the spear Siss carried leap away from him, and suddenly a dull whack and the broad back fell away forward, and he looked Ugh-lomi in the face over his prostrate leader. It felt to Bo as if his heart had fallen down a well. He had a throwing-stone in one hand and an ashen stabbing-stick in the other. He did not live {{to the end of his}} momentary hesitation which to use.|$|R
25|$|Other {{cichlids}} are predatory and eat {{little or}} no plant matter. These include generalists that catch a variety of small animals, including other fishes and insect larvae (e.g. Pterophyllum), as well as variety of specialists. Trematocranus is a specialized <b>snail-eater,</b> while Pungu maclareni feeds on sponges. A number of cichlids feed on other fish, either entirely or in part. Crenicichla species are stealth-predators that lunge from concealment at passing small fish, while Rhamphochromis species are open-water pursuit predators that chase down their prey. Paedophagous cichlids such as the Caprichromis species eat other species' eggs or young, in some cases ramming the heads of mouthbrooding species {{to force them to}} disgorge their young. Among the more unusual feeding strategies are those of Corematodus, Docimodus evelynae, Plecodus, Perissodus, and Genyochromis spp., which feed on scales and fins of other fishes, a behavior known as lepidophagy, along with the death-mimicking behaviour of Nimbochromis and Parachromis species, which lay motionless, luring small fish to their side prior to ambush.|$|R
6000|$|And {{the next}} day, while {{the sun was}} still high, the hunters returned--all save One Eye, who lay dead with a smashed skull {{at the foot of}} the ledge. (When Ugh-lomi came back that evening from {{stalking}} the horses, he found the vultures already busy over him.) And with them the hunters brought Eudena bruised and wounded, but alive. That had been the strange order of the shrivelled old woman, that she was to be brought alive--"She is no kill for us. She is for Uya the Lion." [...] Her hands were tied with thongs, as though she had been a man, and she came weary and drooping--her hair over her eyes and matted with blood. They walked about her, and ever and again the <b>Snail-eater,</b> whose name she had given, would laugh and strike her with his ashen spear. And after he had struck her with his spear, he would look over his shoulder like one who had done an over-bold deed. The others, too, looked over their shoulders ever and again, and all were in a hurry save Eudena. When the old woman saw them coming, she cried aloud with joy.|$|R
