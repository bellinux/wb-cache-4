5|$|Tomlinson {{was born}} to Jim and Ann Tomlinson in Matlock, Derbyshire. He moved to London when he was 17 {{to work as a}} <b>scaffolder.</b> At the time of his death, at the age of 47, he was working casually as a vendor for the Evening Standard, London's evening newspaper. Married twice with nine children, {{including}} stepchildren, Tomlinson had a history of alcoholism, as a result of which he had been living apart from his second wife, Julia, for 13 years, and had experienced long periods of homelessness. He had been staying since 2008 in the Lindsey Hotel, a shelter for the homeless on Lindsey Street, Smithfield, EC1. At the time of his death, he was walking across London's financial district in an effort to reach the Lindsey Hotel, his way hampered at several points by police lines. The route he took was his usual way home from a newspaper stand on Fish Street Hill outside Monument tube station, where he worked with a friend, Barry Smith.|$|E

500|$|There {{were several}} deaths of {{employees}} {{working on the}} CTRL over the construction period. One occurred on 28 March 2003 near Folkestone when a worker {{came into contact with}} the energised power supply. Another death occurred two months later, in May 2003, when a <b>scaffolder</b> fell seven metres at Thurrock, Essex. Three companies were found guilty of breaching health and safety legislation by omitting to provide barriers, resulting in Deverson Direct Ltd. being ordered to pay a fine of £50,000, J.Murphy & Sons Ltd. £25,000, and Hochtief AG £25,000. Two more deaths resulted from a fire on board a train carrying wires, one mile (...) inside a tunnel under the Thames between Swanscombe, Kent, and Thurrock, Essex on 16 August 2005. The train shunter died at the scene and the train driver later died in hospital. It has been suggested that a large amount of blame for accidents throughout the project lay with individual behaviour, becoming such a problem that an internal programme was launched to tackle problem behaviour during the construction.|$|E

2500|$|On 14 April 2003, Mason and {{two friends}} Mark and Simon Gibson, {{were found guilty}} of aggravated {{burglary}} with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The victim of the attack, Poole <b>scaffolder</b> Neal Harley, was left with a broken nose, scalp cuts, facial swelling and bruising. The attack, which was sparked by a Yorkshire terrier dog named Doris which Mark Gibson had bought for Harley's fiancee Jane Graham while {{they were having a}} relationship some years earlier and had been [...] "hostile" [...] towards her new boyfriends. On 3 April 2002, Ms Graham had agreed to care for the dog but later returned it as it behaved too aggressively. Prosecutor, Mark Worsley, said that because of this Mark Gibson decided to confront Mr Harley and turned up that night with a hammer and his accomplices, saying: [...] "Come on boys, let's do him". The Gibson brothers received five- and six-year sentences and Mason received a three-year sentence on 2 June 2003, but he served just over a year.|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} native Dutch and Turkish workers {{receiving}} a permanent disability pension in the Netherlands is still rising. To assess {{ethnic differences in}} disability risk between Dutch and Turkish <b>scaffolders,</b> a retrospective study was conducted within a large scaffolding company. Medical files for the period 1981 - 2000 were used to gather information on ethnicity, age at entering service, age at becoming disabled, years of employment, the year to receive a disability pension, the disability diagnosis, and the percentage rating of the disability pension. In the past 20 yr, 131 Turkish and 125 Dutch <b>scaffolders</b> have become disabled. Musculoskeletal disorders were {{the primary reason for}} the diagnosis. No differences in diagnoses were observed, except for a small difference in cardiovascular disease. Turkish <b>scaffolders</b> started their work at an older age, received the disability pension at an older age, and had a longer duration of employment. Turkish <b>scaffolders</b> faced disability 2. 48 (95 % confidence interval 1. 94 - 3. 18) times more often than their Dutch colleagues, adjusted for age. Explanations for the differences in disability risk between Dutch and Turkish <b>scaffolders</b> are sought in the older age at start of employment, lower mobility in the labour market, and less access to medical and social care. In future, employers, general practitioners, occupational health physicians and social security workers, as stakeholders in reintegration, should sufficiently attune their activities concerning care and cure for Turkish construction workers on long-term sick leave or during reintegration into other work...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a simple and}} fast approach for genome scaffolding, combining constraint modeling and simple graph manipulation. We model the scaffolding problem as an optimization problem on a graph built from a paired-end reads alignment on contigs, then describe an heuristic {{to solve this problem}} with the iterative combination of local constraints solving and cycle breaking phases. We tested our approach on a benchmark of various genomes, and compared it with several usual <b>scaffolders.</b> The proposed method is quick, flexible, and provides results comparable to other <b>scaffolders</b> in terms of quality. In addition, contrarily to state of the art approaches that require dedicated servers, it can be run on a basic notebook computer even for large genomes...|$|R

40|$|A {{step-by-step}} approach to better work, {{aimed at reducing}} physical workload among <b>scaffolders,</b> is evaluated. The approach {{is based on a}} strong commitment of the management in the enterprise. Workers participated as direct as possible. Information on branch level of Arbouw showed the need for improvement. In a department of a middle sized enterprise, 50 <b>scaffolders</b> completed a checklist to identify the problems. These determined the user requirements for the redesign of the working methods. Redesign proposals of TNO were tested by the workers. Based on the test a steering group led by the management chose the improvements. Before implementation, the effect on musculoskeletal load was tested, and half a year after implementation the number of changes and the process were evaluated. The shoulder complaints and physical work load during horizontal and vertical transport were the major problems. The main improvements were mechanizing the transport, decreasing the loads and organizing the work in another way. Due to these changes the musculoskeletal load was significantly decreased, especially on the shoulder. Only 26 % of the subjects responded to the evaluation on the number of improvements after half a year. These data indicated that for the major problems improvements were implemented, which reduced the physical workload and the perceived shoulder- and backpain. The process evaluation indicated that the approach was considered worthwhile, especially regarding the involvement of <b>scaffolders</b> themselves...|$|R

Mothers and children were videotaped while the mother taught the child to construct a small pyramid from 21 interlocking blocks and again when the child attempted the task independently. The tapes were coded and analyzed to examine maternal instructional style and subsequent independent child performance. Mothers who were considered to have positive expectations towards their children used appropriate scaffolding behaviors significantly more often than the mothers who were considered to have negative expectations towards their children. The children of mothers who were effective <b>scaffolders</b> were significantly more adept and independent problem-solvers than the children whose mothers were not effective <b>scaffolders.</b> The more contingent the mother's instructions were, the more independent and successful the child appeared.

40|$|Abstract: The mitogen-activated {{protein kinase}} (MAPK) pathway is the {{canonical}} signaling pathway for many receptor tyrosine kinases, {{such as the}} Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. Downstream of the receptors, this pathway involves the activation of a kinase cascade that culminates in a transcriptional response and affects processes, such as cell migration and adhesion. In addition, the strength and duration of the upstream signal also influence the mode of the cellular response that is switched on. Thus, the same components can in principle coordinate opposite responses, such as proliferation and differentiation. In recent years, it has become evident that MAPK signaling is regulated and fine-tuned by proteins that can bind to several MAPK signaling proteins simultaneously and, thereby, affect their function. These so-called MAPK scaffolding proteins are, thus, important coordinators of the signaling response in cells. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the research on MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway <b>scaffolders.</b> We will not only review the well-known members of the family, such as kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), but also put a special focus on {{the function of the}} recently identified or less studied <b>scaffolders,</b> such as fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2...|$|R
