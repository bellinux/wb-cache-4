The theoretical part describes the current situation related to aging, engaged in gerontology, biological, psychological and social manifestations of aging, preparing for retirement, communication with the elderly, seniors' quality of life, social exclusion of older people, further discusses the services provided to the elderly, the role of social workers in residential facilities, individual planning, active aging, activation programs for seniors.

The design of effective policies and incentive systems, in turn, requires {{a good understanding of}} why academics activate their social capital with industry at all. The objective of this research was to develop a comprehensive but parsimonious model that would provide insight into the key determinants of academics’ <b>social</b> capital <b>activation</b> with industry, and to understand and explain the way these factors lead to the actual behavior. We first examined the role of specific motives in forming the general motivation of academics to activate their social capital with industry. We also examined the effects of dispositional factors (i. e., perceived social influence, motivation and perceived ability) and positional factors (i. e., hierarchical position, scientific orientation, scientific domain) on <b>social</b> capital <b>activation.</b> Finally, we explored the moderating and mediating roles of the trigger in the relationship between passive social capital and <b>social</b> capital <b>activation.</b> The results show that decisions academics face with regard to interaction with industry are primarily determined by their experience in the past. Policies building on the notion of prior experience need to aim at creating opportunities for newcomers to get involved in projects with industry at early stages of their academic career...|$|R

These services are very important and necessary for the mentioned persons, because through these services the people can get actively involved into the society. In the theoretical part there are explained important concepts relating to the issue of the seniors and persons with disabilities. Further there is also a description of the Act No. 108 / 2006 Coll., on Social Services and an overview of the provided social services. A content analysis of relevant documents was used to work out the thesis. The research part was carried out by an interviewing method, a technique of a semi-structured interview. In total 11 facilities providing <b>social</b> <b>activation</b> services for seniors and persons with disabilities in the South Bohemian Region took part in the research. The interview consisted of 10 questions.

40|$|In Belgium, like {{in other}} western {{countries}} with a longer tradition of activation of unemployed and other inactive groups, {{the diversity of}} activation programs has increased. A new type labelled as ‘social activation’ {{is not intended to}} directly foster participation in paid work, but instead covers a wide range of socio-cultural, neighbourhood, personal development and volunteering activities, in which usually various vulnerable groups (jobless and other inactive groups) participate in their leisure time, and for reasons of social integration. The paper examines to what extent <b>social</b> <b>activation</b> {{can be seen as a}} further differentiation of the services offered for those for whom employment activation is not considered feasible. We start by examining some conceptual issues. Then we describe the activities, target groups and policy goals with regard to ‘social activation’. The central question is which factors affect the extent in which local social offices, responsible for social assistance, are offering this type of <b>social</b> <b>activation,</b> and how this is related to the employment activation of their clients. Our data are based on a web survey in 2011 with responsible officers of a sample of 234 local social offices in Belgium. Using structural equation modelling, we find that the variation in the extent of <b>social</b> <b>activation</b> can be explained from contextual, local policy and organizational factors. The paper demonstrates that <b>social</b> <b>activation</b> is a broadly-rooted practice, by which it reaches a considerable number of participants from less advantaged groups. Local social offices place their activities within a three-fold frame of reference: participation in paid work, participation in activities that prepare for possible participation in work, and participation in activities that support the social functioning and the citizenship in the local community.

40|$|Social context {{has been}} shown to have a {{profound}} influence on brain activation {{in a wide range of}} vertebrate species. Best studied in songbirds, when males sing undirected song, the level of neural activity and expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) in several song nuclei is dramatically higher or lower than when they sing directed song to other birds, particularly females. This differential <b>social</b> context-dependent <b>activation</b> is independent of auditory input and is not simply dependent on the motor act of singing. These findings suggested that the critical sensory modality driving social context-dependent differences in the brain could be visual cues. Here, we tested this hypothesis by examining IEG activation in song nuclei in hemispheres to which visual input was normal or blocked. We found that covering one eye blocked visually induced IEG expression throughout both contralateral visual pathways of the brain, and reduced activation of the contralateral ventral tegmental area, a non-visual midbrain motivation-related area affected by social context. However, blocking visual input had no effect on the <b>social</b> context-dependent <b>activation</b> of the contralateral song nuclei during female-directed singing. Our findings suggest that individual sensory modalities are not direct driving forces for the social context differences in song nuclei during singing. Rather, these social context differences in brain activation appear to depend more on the general sense that another individual is present...|$|R
