40|$|Dementia is {{generally}} considered as rapidly progressive [rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) ], in cases with overt cognitive impairment, established within months. Data about the relative frequency of underlying diseases in cases of RPD are few and extremely variable, depending on the clinical setting. We examined the relative frequency of {{the underlying causes of}} RPD, in a university tertiary referral center, in Athens. A series of consecutive patients presenting with RPD in a 3 -year period was included. All patients received a comprehensive clinical, imaging, and laboratory evaluation. Of a total of 279 patients hospitalized for dementia diagnosis, 68 patients had RPD (37 males and 31 females). Mean age at onset +/- SD was 65. 5 +/- 10. 0. The most common cause of RPD was <b>secondary</b> <b>dementias,</b> accounting for 18 cases (26. 5 %). Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia were almost equally represented, accounting for 12 (17. 6 %) and 11 (16. 2 %) cases, respectively.

The study was divided into two phases: a door to door survey of the entire population aged 40 years and over (503 persons), followed by a clinical examination of suspected cases for positive and differential diagnosis of dementia and cognitive impairment. The prevalence of age-associated memory impairment was 3. 6 % in individuals of 40 years and over and 7. 1 % in individuals of 65 years and over, whereas dementia was found in 2. 6 % and 5. 2 %, respectively. The prevalence rates of both clinical conditions increased with age.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the frequency and}} causes of early-onset dementia (EOD) in consecutive patients in it highly specialized dementia referral center, focusing oil unusual cases, particularly with early and/or rapid onset, in Athens, Greece. Methods: Patients referred for dementia diagnosis according to specific referral criteria during it 3 years period. We examined the distribution of patients diagnosis and differences in sex, education, dementia severity, cognitive function, and the duration of disease (from onset to referral) between the EOD (< 65 y) and the late-onset dementia (LOD) groups. Results: From a total of 260 consecutive demented patients, there were 114 EOD patients or 44 % of all demented patients. No significant differences were observed between the EOD and LOD groups in cognitive or behavioral measures. However, the duration from onset to consultation was significantly longer in the EOD group. Also, in the EOD group, the rates of patients with Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease dementia were relatively low {{and the rate of}} patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration was relatively high and the proportion of <b>secondary</b> <b>dementias</b> was high.

40|$|Dementia is {{a common}} illness with an {{incidence}} that is rising as the aged population increases. There {{are a number of}} neurodegenerative diseases that cause dementia, including Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia, which is subdivided into the behavioral variant, the semantic variant, and nonfluent variant. Numerous other neurodegenerative illnesses have an associated dementia, including corticobasal degeneration, Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease, Huntington‚Äôs disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, Parkinson‚Äôs disease dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Vascular dementia and AIDS <b>dementia</b> are <b>secondary</b> <b>dementias.</b> Diagnostic criteria have relied on a constellation of symptoms, but the definite diagnosis remains a pathologic one. As treatments become available and target specific molecular abnormalities, differentiating amongst the various primary dementias early on becomes essential. The role of imaging in dementia has traditionally been directed at ruling out treatable and reversible etiologies and not to use imaging to better understand the pathophysiology of the different dementias. Different brain imaging techniques allow the examination of the structure, biochemistry, metabolic state, and functional capacity of the brain. All of the major neurodegenerative disorders have relatively specific imaging findings that can be identified. New imaging techniques carry the hope of revolutionizing the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease so as to obtain a complete molecular, structural, and metabolic characterization, which could be used to improve diagnosis and to stage each patient and follow disease progression and response to treatment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Phase 3 trials {{supporting}} dextromethorphan/quinidine (DM/Q) use as {{a treatment}} for pseudobulbar affect (PBA) were conducted in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or multiple sclerosis (MS). The PRISM II study provides additional DM/Q experience with PBA <b>secondary</b> to <b>dementia,</b> stroke, or traumatic brain injury (TBI). METHODS: Participants in this open-label, multicenter, 90 -day trial received DM/Q 20 / 10 mg twice daily. The primary outcome was the Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS), assessing change in PBA episode frequency and severity. The CNS-LS final visit score was compared to baseline (primary analysis) and to the response in a previously conducted placebo-controlled trial with DM/Q in patients with ALS or MS. Secondary outcomes included change in PBA episode count and Clinical Global Impression of Change with respect to PBA as rated by a clinician (CGI-C) and by the patient or caregiver (PGI-C). RESULTS: The study enrolled 367 participants with PBA <b>secondary</b> to <b>dementia,</b> stroke, or TBI. Mean (standard deviation [SD]) CNS-LS score improved significantly from 20. 4 (4. 4) at baseline to 12. 8 (5. 0) at Day 90 /Final Visit (change, - 7. 7 [6. 1]; P[*]<[*]. 001, 95 % CI: - 8. 4, - 7. 0). This magnitude of improvement was consistent with DM/Q improvement in the earlier phase- 3, placebo-controlled trial (mean [95 % CI] change from baseline, - 8. 2 [- 9. 4, - 7. 0]) and numerically exceeds the improvement seen with placebo in that study (- 5. 7 [- 6. 8, - 4. 7]). Reduction in PBA episode count was 72. 3 % at Day 90 /Final Visit compared with baseline (P[*]<[*]. 001). Scores on CGI-C and PGI-C showed that 76. 6 and 72. 4 % of participants, respectively, were "much" or "very much" improved with respect to PBA. The most frequently occurring adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (5. 4 %), headache (4. 1 %), urinary tract infection (2. 7 %), and dizziness (2. 5 %); 9. 8 % had AEs that led to discontinuation. Serious AEs were reported in 6. 3 %; however, none were considered treatment related. CONCLUSIONS: DM/Q was shown to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for PBA <b>secondary</b> to <b>dementia,</b> stroke, or TBI. The magnitude of PBA improvement was similar to that reported in patients with PBA secondary to ALS or MS, and the adverse event profile was consistent with the known safety profile of DM/Q.

40|$|Transcranial {{magnetic}} stimulation (TMS) {{is emerging}} as a promising tool to non-invasively assess specific cortical circuits in neurological diseases. A {{number of studies have}} reported the abnormalities in TMS assays of cortical function in dementias. A PubMed-based literature review on TMS studies targeting primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>dementia</b> has been conducted using the key words "transcranial magnetic stimulation" or "motor cortex excitability" and "dementia" or "cognitive impairment" or "memory impairment" or "memory decline". Cortical excitability is increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in vascular dementia (VaD), generally reduced in secondary dementias. Short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), a measure of central cholinergic circuitry, is normal in VaD and in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but suppressed in AD. In mild cognitive impairment, abnormal SAI may predict the progression to AD. No change in cortical excitability has been observed in FTD, in Parkinson's dementia and in dementia with Lewy bodies. Short-interval intracortical inhibition and controlateral silent period (cSP), two measures of gabaergic cortical inhibition, are abnormal in most dementias associated with parkinsonian symptoms. Ipsilateral silent period (iSP), which is dependent on integrity of the corpus callosum is abnormal in AD. While single TMS measure owns low specificity, a panel of measures can support the clinical diagnosis, predict progression and possibly identify earlier the "brain at risk". In dementias, TMS can be also exploited to select and evaluate the responders to specific drugs and, it might become a rehabilitative tool, in the attempt to restore impaired brain plasticity. ¬© 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology...|$|E

Age-scaled neurobehavioral test results (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale‚ÄîRevised and Wechsler Memory Scale) from Alzheimer's (AD) and Huntington's (HD) patients, matched for intellectual disability, as well as normal controls were used to derive a classification formula. Stepwise discriminant analysis accurately (99 % correct) distinguished controls from demented patients, and separated the two patient groups (79 % correct). Variables discriminating between HD and AD patient groups consisted of complex psychomotor tasks, visuospatial function, attention and memory. The reliability of the classification formula was demonstrated with a new, independent sample of AD and HD patients which yielded virtually identical results (classification accuracy for dementia: 96 %; AD versus HD: 78 %). To validate the formula, the discriminant function was applied to Parkinson's (PD) patients, 38 % of whom were classified as demented. The validity of the classification was demonstrated by significant PD subgroup differences on measures of dementia not included in the discriminant function. Moreover, a majority of demented PD patients (65 %) were classified as having an HD-like pattern of cognitive deficits, in line with previous reports of the subcortical nature of PD dementia. This approach may thus be useful in classifying presence or absence of dementia and in discriminating between dementia subtypes in cases of secondary or coincidental dementia...|$|E

Women with late-onset AD of mild to moderate severity were randomly allocated to high-dose (120 mg) oral raloxifene or identical placebo provided once daily. The primary outcome compared between treatment groups at 12 months was change in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). RESULTS: Forty-two women randomized to raloxifene or placebo were included in intent-to-treat analyses (mean age 76 years, range 68 - 84), and 39 women contributed 12 -month outcomes.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} effects of {{introducing}} a nursing guideline on depression in residents with dementia of psychogeriatric nursing home wards. METHODS: A multi-center controlled clinical trial with randomization at ward level was used to study {{the effects of}} the guideline introduction. Nursing teams were trained in applying the guideline to their own residents diagnosed with depression in dementia. Key elements of the nursing guideline are increasing individualized pleasant activities and decreasing unpleasant events. Participating residents were 97 residents diagnosed with dementia and comorbid depression, from 18 psychogeriatric nursing home wards, in 9 Dutch nursing homes. Measurements took place at pre-test, post-test and follow-up. Primary outcome was severity of depression measured with the MDS/RAI-Depression Rating Scale (DRS) and the Cornell Scale for Depression in <b>Dementia.</b> <b>Secondary</b> outcome is mood as measured by the FACE-observation scale. RESULTS: Compliance with the nursing guideline was moderate. Despite this, residents on the experimental wards showed a significant reduction in depression on the DRS. With the Cornell scale a reduction of depression was found as well, although not significantly different from that in the control group. No effects on observed mood were found. CONCLUSION: This study shows significant reductions in depression severity by introducing a nursing guideline on psychogeriatric nursing home wards. Better compliance with the guideline could probably enlarge the effects. Some ways to achieve enhanced compliance are: (1) additionally train non-certified nurse assistants, and (2) emphasize necessary conditions for successful introduction of the guideline to nursing team managers.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ascertainment bias (AB) {{indicates}} a bias of an evaluation centre in estimating the prevalence/incidence {{of a disease}} due to the specific expertise of the centre. The aim of our study was to evaluate classification {{of different types of}} dementia in new cases appearing in secondary and tertiary centres, in order to evidence possible occurrence of AB in the various (<b>secondary</b> to tertiary) <b>dementia</b> centres. METHODS: To assess the mechanism of AB, the rates of new cases of the different forms of dementia reported by different centres were compared. The centres involved in the study were 11 hospital-based centres including a tertiary centre, located in the University Department of Clinical Neurology. The tertiary centre is endowed with state-of-the-art diagnostic facilities and its scientific production is prominently focused on dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) thus suggesting the possible occurrence of a bias. Four main categories of dementia were identified: Alzheimer's disease (AD), DLB, fronto-temporal dementia (FTD), vascular dementia (VaD), with other forms in a category apart. The classification rate of new cases of dementia in the tertiary centre was compared with rates reported by secondary centres and rates of recoding were calculated during a follow-up of 2 years.

40|$|Background: Fahr‚Äôs disease (basal ganglia calcification) is {{characterized}} by bi hemispherical calcium deposition in basal ganglia, dentate nucleus and semioval center. Its clinical manifestations are a rigid hypokinetic syndrome, mood disorders and cognitive impairment. Aim: To report {{to the results of}} a neurological assessment of three siblings with Fahr disease. Patients and methods: Three sisters, aged 55, 56 and 58 years, were studied. All had a rigid hypokinetic clinical picture associated with cerebellar involvement and a cognitive impairment that progressed in 8, 6 and 10 years respectively. Brain CAT scans showed symmetric and extensive calcifications of cerebellar white matter and dentate nuclei, pons, mesencephalon, lenticular nuclei, thalami and semioval centers. Hypoparathyroidism was ruled out. Cognition was assessed with WAIS and Benton tests and Weschler memory scale. The time of reaction to visual stimuli was studied. The processing speed of visual information and the interhemispheric conduction time of such information, were calculated. Cognitive evoked potentials (P 300) were also studied. Results: Cognitive impairment involved verbal and visual-spatial memory, planning, attention and concentration capacities and visual constructive skills. There was a prolongation of reaction time latencies and loss of the normal asymmetry of interhemispheric transmission (without right to left facilitation). P 300 evoked potentials were absent. Conclusions: These observations suggest that the pathogenesis of cognitive and motor changes in Fahr‚Äôs disease is based in a dysfunction of cortico basal connections and their interhemispheric relations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) is a multi-center, randomized, {{controlled}} trial ongoing in Finland. MATERIALS: Participants (1200 {{individuals at}} risk of cognitive decline) are recruited from previous population-based non-intervention studies. Inclusion criteria are CAIDE Dementia Risk Score ‚â• 6 and cognitive performance at the mean level or slightly lower than expected for age (but not substantial impairment) assessed with the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) neuropsychological battery. The 2 -year multidomain intervention consists of: nutritional guidance; exercise; cognitive training and social activity; and management of metabolic and vascular risk factors. Persons {{in the control group}} receive regular health advice. The primary outcome is cognitive performance as measured by the modified Neuropsychological Test Battery, Stroop test, and Trail Making Test. Main <b>secondary</b> outcomes are: <b>dementia</b> (after extended follow-up); disability; depressive symptoms; vascular risk factors and outcomes; quality of life; utilization of health resources; and neuroimaging measures. RESULTS: Screening began in September 2009 and was completed in December 2011. All 1200 persons are enrolled and the intervention is ongoing as planned. Baseline clinical characteristics indicate that several vascular risk factors and unhealthy lifestyle-related factors are present, creating a window of opportunity for prevention. The intervention will be completed during 2014. CONCLUSIONS: The FINGER is at the forefront of international collaborative efforts to solve the clinical and public health problems of early identification of individuals at increased risk of late-life cognitive impairment, and of developing intervention strategies to prevent or delay the onset of cognitive impairment and dementia...|$|R

Teachers have embraced this challenge {{as part of the}}ir curriculum, devising ways to help pupils from both primary and <b>secondary</b> schools understand <b>dementia.</b> Schools have partnered with community organisations, Alzheimer‚Äôs Society and local care homes to enable pupils to meet people living with dementia and to spend time with them and their carers. A range of innovative curriculum activities have been devised which are brought to life in this presentation where footage of pupils will be shared with the audience. The Association for Dementia Studies, working with the Department of Health, evaluated the Intergenerational Schools Project, conducting both pre and post intervention questionnaires for pupils and undertaking interviews with teachers to find out the most effective approaches to introducing this subject into the curriculum. If we aspire to create dementia friendly communities we must ensure future generations are prepared with the knowledge, understanding and experience of those living with dementia. The evaluation brings together the challenges of introducing this material to the curriculum, the changes evidenced in pupil knowledge and understanding and a wealth of resources for teachers. It also acts as springboard to consider how such sensitive topics can be introduced to the PHSE curriculum. The presentation will share the results of the evaluation of this pioneering project and open up discussion to consider the best way to ensure all schools have access to these curriculum resources to shape the understanding attitudes of future generations...|$|R

The high blood sugar level can be a significant factor for the incidence of Alzheimer, which could be a <b>secondary</b> cause for <b>dementia.</b> Other research works revealed that the executive functions of the elderly with DM were more impaired than in those without DM. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM 2) is associated to cognitive and functional deficits and, one of the tools, which can be used to assess executive functions, is the WCST. For the performance of the theoretical chapter, a systematic revision was performed with the aim of verifying the characteristics of the indexed publications of the last eight years, which approach the following subjects: Type 2 Diabetes, elderly people, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, thought and cognitive flexibility, and executive functions.

40|$|Abstract Background Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is a psychosocial {{evidence-based}} group {{intervention for}} people with dementia recommended by the UK NICE guidelines. In clinical trials, CST {{has been shown to}} improve cognition and quality of life, but {{little is known about the}} best way of ensuring implementation of CST in practice settings. A recent pilot study found that a third of people who attend CST training go on to run CST in practice, but staff identified a lack of support as a key reason for the lack of implementation. Methods/design There are three projects in this study: The first is a pragmatic multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) of staff training, comparing CST training and outreach support with CST training only; the second, the monitoring and outreach trial, is a phase IV trial that evaluates implementation of CST in practice by staff members who have previously had the CST manual or attended training. Centres will be randomised to receive outreach support. The primary outcome measure for both of these trials is the number of CST sessions run {{for people with}} <b>dementia.</b> <b>Secondary</b> outcomes include the number of attenders at sessions, job satisfaction, dementia knowledge and attitudes, competency, barriers to change, approach to learning and a controllability of beliefs and the level of adherence. Focus groups will assess staff members‚Äô perceptions of running CST groups and receiving outreach support. The third study involves monitoring centres running groups in their usual practice and looking at basic outcomes of cognition and quality of life for the person with dementia. Discussion These studies assess the effects of outreach support on putting CST into practice and running groups effectively in a variety of care settings with people with dementia; evaluate the effectiveness of CST in standard clinical practice; and identify key factors promoting or impeding the successful running of groups.

40|$|Brain imaging {{has been}} mainly used to exclude other <b>secondary</b> causes of <b>dementia,</b> {{the past decade}} has {{highlighted}} a wider potential role of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and monitoring progression of Alzheimer's disease. Using a cohort of subjects with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease, I found that atrophy rate of the hippocampus, a medial temporal lobe structure crucially involved in memory processing, to be increased at least 5. 5 years prior to the onset of the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Rates of whole brain atrophy lagged behind by 2 years. I compared focal and global measures of atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging with decline in performance on cognitive and functional scales {{in the context of a}} realistic multi-centre clinical trial. In mild-tomoderate stages of Alzheimer's disease, measures of global atrophy (rate of whole brain atrophy and ventricular enlargement) were associated more closely ~ith decline in performance on cognitive and functional scales than was rate of hippocampal atrophy. Measures of medial temporal lobe atrophy conventionally rely either on manual volumetric measurement, which is time consuming, or on a visual rating scale, which is not designed to track disease progression. I describe an automated technique - the Automated Temporal Lobe Atrophy Scale, relying on intensity measurement using volumetric Tl-weighted imaging as a measure of medial temporal atrophy. The method is quick, simple, and may have potential to track disease progression. Few studies have demonstrated the value of novel magnetic resonance imaging techniques that reflect the microstructural pathological changes magnetization transfer imaging a'nd diffusion-weighted imaging [...] Here, I demonstrate that certain quantitative parameters of such techniques are altered by the disease process over-and-above atrophy measurements. This suggests that such imaging techniques may provide complementary information to conventional volumetric measurement in detecting the Alzheimer's disease process.

40|$|Background: Masticatory {{functioning}} alters with age. However, mastication {{has been}} found to be related to, for example, cognitive functioning, food intake, and some aspects of activities of daily living. Since cognitive functioning and activities of daily living show a decline in older adults with dementia, improving masticatory functioning may be of relevance to them. A possible way to improve mastication may be showing videos of people who are chewing. Observing chewing movements may activate the mirror neuron system, which becomes also activated during the execution of that same movement. The primary hypothesis is that the observation of chewing has a beneficial effect on masticatory functioning, or, more specifically, masticatory ability of older adults with <b>dementia.</b> <b>Secondary,</b> the intervention is hypothesized to have beneficial effects on food intake, cognition, activities of daily living, depression, and quality of life. Methods/Design: An adjusted parallel randomized controlled trial is being performed in dining rooms of residential care settings. Older adults with dementia, for whom also additional eligibility criteria apply, are randomly assigned to the experimental (videos of chewing people) or control condition (videos of nature and buildings), by drawing folded pieces of paper. Participants who are able to watch each other's videos are assigned to the same study condition. The intervention takes place during lunchtime, from Monday to Friday, for 3 months. During four moments of measurement, masticatory ability, food intake, cognitive functioning, activities of daily living, depression, and quality of life are assessed. Tests administrators blind to the group allocation administer the tests to participants. Discussion: The goal of this study is to examine the effects of video observation of chewing on masticatory ability and several secondary outcome measures. In this study, the observation of chewing is added to the execution of the same action (i. e., during eating). Beneficial effects on masticatory ability, and consequently on the other outcome measures are hypothesized. The intervention may be easily integrated into daily care, and might add to the lives of the increasing number of older adults with dementia by beneficially influencing multiple daily life functions...|$|R
40|$|Caregivers of {{individuals}} with dementia are characterized by high levels of stress, burden, drug use, depression, and physical decline. Caregiving spouses, especially wives are particularly vulnerable to negative consequences of caregiving. Efforts to mitigate these consequences are hampered by poor understanding of how caregivers (1) decide upon and implement daily management plans, (2) interact with health professionals, and (3) interpret their caregiving role. This knowledge gap also compromises the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of services designed to develop caregiving skills for managing the <b>secondary</b> symptoms of <b>dementia.</b> ^ This study, based on a planning theory of human behavior, describes the theories of care by which caregivers decide upon and take action to solve daily management problems. Presented in this dissertation is a descriptive investigation which combines the concepts of caregiver planning processes, gender-related role socialization, and collaboration with a health provider to explore the relationships among three aspects of the caregiving experience, (1) caregivers 2 ÃÜ 7 theories of care, (2) an intervention designed to develop skills for planning daily management, and (3) gender influences on the caregiving process. ^ Using techniques borrowed from grounded theory, interview and observation data were analyzed to identify the care theories of 26 caregivers who provide care to a spouse with moderate impairment from Alzheimer 2 ÃÜ 7 s disease. This analysis revealed that caregivers develop their preferred care theory by combining principles, or beliefs, about caregiving in an integrated process of assessment, planning and management work. Principles which are commonly grouped together formed a continuum of care theories used by caregivers in this study. That care theory continuum ranged from an emphasis on enabling the care recipient to engage in productive activities, to a focus on managing care by enforcing rules. The type of care theory preferred by each subject was associated with gender of the caregiver and influenced the outcomes of client-therapist interactions in a collaborative therapeutic relationship. Despite methodological issues related to small sample size, important implications for practice, policy, and research are suggested. ...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES [...] To {{assess the}} value of death {{certification}} for the epidemiological study of dementia, {{the frequency with which}} the condition was recorded on death certificates of patients diagnosed with some form of dementia before the age of 65 years was studied. A further objective was to identify variables associated with failure to record dementia on the certificate. DESIGN [...] A cohort of patients with presenile dementia, differentiated by a clinical algorithm applied to hospital case records, was traced through the National Health Service Central Registry and details of certified causes of death were obtained. SETTING [...] The Northern Regional Health Authority in England. SUBJECTS [...] Prevalent cases of presenile dementia resident in the northern health region during 1986 traced up to April 1992. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] The underlying cause of death was recorded as dementia or as Alzheimer's disease in 53 % of cases of clinically diagnosed presenile Alzheimer's disease, 33 % of cases of presenile vascular dementia, and 10 % of cases of presenile <b>dementia</b> <b>secondary</b> to another neurological condition. Dementia or Alzheimer's disease was recorded in any part of the certificate in 75 % of cases of Alzheimer's disease, 52 % of vascular dementia, 33 % of other dementias, and in 65 % of cases overall. Dementia or a cerebral condition of a kind that can result in dementia was recorded in 80 % of all cases. Failure to mention dementia was related to the clinical type of dementia, shorter duration of illness, and earlier period of study. CONCLUSIONS [...] The underlying cause of death seriously understates the frequency of dementia, but when the recording of other brain disease is taken into account the presence of potentially dementing brain disease is recorded much more frequently. It is suggested that coding chronic conditions present at death, such as dementia, in addition to those causing or contributing to death would improve {{the value of}} death certificates for epidemiological purposes...|$|R
40|$|A {{direct link}} between {{cognition}} and endocrine function has been established at several levels, from preclinical models to large clinical surveys. In this regard, international guidelines suggest performing a screening test for thyroid function (circulating TSH level) in subjects with cognitive impairment in order to exclude a possible reversible cause of dementia [1]. Moreover, marked cognitive changes have been observed in patients with severe hypercortisolism [2]. Apart from the full-blown manifestations of hypothyroidism and hypercortisolism that may account for <b>secondary</b> causes of <b>dementia,</b> either subclinical thyroid dysfunction or mild adrenal hyper-function along with several other endocrine diseases including testosterone deficit, obesity and glucose metabolism alterations, have been observed in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting a potential role of these clinical entities on Alzheimer (AD) or Parkinson Disease (PD) development [3 - 8]. Moreover, we have to mention the possible link between cognition and neuro-endocrine alterations associated with cardiovascular dysfunction. In this regard, the adrenergic system seems to {{play a key role}} in the cognitive alterations observed in heart failure [9]. However, given that all these clinical conditions increase the cardiovascular risk and the consequent risk of vascular dementia, it is very difficult to distinguish their possible direct role on the neurodegenerative process from that consequent to chronic cerebrovascular disease. In any case, when analyzing the scientific literature regarding the association between mild endocrine or metabolic disorders and neurodegeneration, conflicting results are still present making the interpretation of reported results very complex. In fact, we have to consider different settings and different age ranges of the available studies along with the time of onset and the duration of the analyzed endocrine dysfunction. An increasing body of evidence suggests a possible concurrent effect of several endocrine disorders and the ageing process on the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and, in general, on cognitive function [3, 4 - 8, 10]. This thematic issue of the Journal ‚ÄúRecent Patents on Endocrine, Metabolic & Immune Drug Discovery‚Äù is aimed to explore these complex relationships and provide an updated review of the literature reporting also on most recent patents that may have an impact on the development and progress of neurodegenerative disease...|$|R
