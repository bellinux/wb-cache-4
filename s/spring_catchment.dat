Springs and wells were monitored for one year and microbial, physical and chemical parameters were determined according to the Czech authorities' requirements. Microbial contamination was recorded in eleven cases mostly during dry summer. Thus dry hydrological conditions should be {{considered as a}} critical factor for water quality. Chemical parameters were exceeded in nitrate concentration at one site, probably due to agriculture in <b>spring</b> <b>catchment.</b> Water quality exceeded required values in 64 %, thus the required frequency of water quality monitoring is not sufficient and water quality could exceed requirements during parts of a year...|$|E
40|$|Karst {{aquifers}} are heterogeneous terrains, {{where it}} is hard to assess any hydraulic parameter. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary for research on karst aquifers. Catchment area of the Gacka river springs is typical Dinaric karst terrain built of karstified carbonates. Groundwater flow is mostly directed by preferential flow paths usually connected with main faults and fracture zones. In the presented case study structural geological and tectonic characteristics were defined. A recession diagram was created, and the water balance was calculated. Tracer-test data were also used for analysis. All these data were compared with the bulk hydrogeochemical and isotopic analyses of spring and surface waters. For this purpose, samples were obtained every month for one hydrological year at 17 sampling locations. Processing of all these data allowed a tenable definition of the Gacka <b>spring</b> <b>catchment</b> area...|$|E

40|$|The river Gacka <b>springs</b> <b>catchment</b> area {{is located}} in the Dinaric karst, which is {{globally}} known as the locus typicus, or classical Karst. It is composed of four major and several minor karst springs of different discharge rates. The river Gacka springs are characterised by great discharge and exceptional quality, so the catchment area of the river is indicated in the Water Management Strategy (OFFICIAL GAZETTE NO. 91 / 08) as an area with strategically important eserves of drinking water for the Republic of Croatia. To determine the hydrogeological characteristics of he subcatchments of this large and complex aquifer system, hydrological and hydrochemical parameters were measured on the main springs. Data collected on the springs were analysed using the recession analysis by the „matching strip“ method, the statistical analysis of a time series of measured data both by autocorrelation (analysis of individual series) and by cross-correlation methods (analysis of interrelationships between time series), multivarilate statistical analysis (Factor Analysis) of hydrochemical parameters using the software package STATISTICA 6. 0 (1998), and geochemical modelling of hydrochemical parameters using the NETPATH computer program. Interpretation of lithological, structural and tectonic characteristics of the rocks, together with tracing data and the applied analytical methods, allowed the <b>springs</b> <b>catchment</b> of the river Gacka to be divided into three subcatchments.

40|$|Soil {{samples from}} 31 {{locations}} in the Una river <b>spring</b> <b>catchment</b> were subject to chemical extraction analyses. The data were presented as distribution maps of potentially toxic elements (Al, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn) in the surface soil of the area. To evaluate {{the vulnerability of the}} immediate spring zone of the karst catchment, the vulnerability map was derived from the application of the PI methodology proposed by the European COST Action 620. The PI method used to produce the vulnerability map takes into account the protective cover (P) and the infiltration conditions (I). It is based on the origin-pathway-target model. The π-factor (π = P ´ I) describes the vulnerability in the area, subdivided into 5 classes: π-factor in the range 0 - 1 implies an area of extreme vulnerability, while π-factor in the range 4 - 5 implies an area of very low vulnerability. The extraction procedure for the elements Al, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn, has been applied {{in order to determine the}} potential mobility and redistribution of elements that could influence the groundwater and affect its quality. The applied extraction was the second step of the sequential procedure proposed by TESSIER et al. (1979), i. e. extraction with 1 mol dm- 3 CH 3 COONa/CH 3 COOH buffer (pH 5). The results provide information on the potential mobility of the studied elements, indicating the possibility of their mobilization through changes in pH. Lead shows the greatest amount of mobility, with a mean of 9 % (max. 16 %) extracted under an acidic condition. Manganese follows with a mean of 5 % (max. 11 %) and zinc, copper and aluminium show less than 1 % (mean) mobility. The vulnerability map of the karst area was produced in order to predict potential problem areas of karst aquifers. The Una <b>spring</b> <b>catchment</b> area presents generally low to moderate vulnerability; 8 % of the studied area can be considered as extremely vulnerable according to the PI-methodology. Based on these data it was possible to delineate areas with a low protection cover i. e. combining the vulnerability map of the karst area with the distribution maps of potentially toxic elements, areas considered extremely vulnerable could be identified. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{vulnerability}} to pollution and hydrochemical variation of groundwater in the mid-west karstic lowlands of Ireland were investigated from October 1992 to September 1993, {{as part of}} an EU STRIDE project at Sligo Regional Technical College. Eleven springs were studied in the three local authority areas of Co. Galway, Co. Mayo, and Co. Roscommon. Nine of the springs drain locally or regionally important karstic aquifers and two drain locally important sand and gravel aquifers. The maximum average daily discharge of any of the springs was 16, 000 m 3 /day. Determination of the vulnerability of groundwater to pollution relies heavily on an examination of subsoil deposits in an area since they can act as a protecting or filtering layer over groundwater. Within aquifers/spring catchments, chemical reactions such as adsorption, solution-precipitation or acid-base reactions occur and modify the hydrochemistry of groundwater (Lloyd and Heathcote, 1985). The hydrochemical processes) that predominate depend cm the mineralogy of the aquifer, the hydrogeological environment, the overlying subsoils, and the history of groundwater movement. The aim of this MSc research thesis was to investigate the hydrochemical variation of spring outflow and to assess the relationship between these variations and the intrinsic vulnerability of the springs and their catchments. If such a relationship can be quantified, then it is hoped that the hydrochemical variation of a spring may indicate the vulnerability of a <b>spring</b> <b>catchment</b> without the need for determining it by field mapping. Such a method would be invaluable to any of the three local authorities since {{they would be able to}} prioritise sources that are most at risk from pollution, using simple techniques of chemical sampling, and statistical analysis. For each spring a detailed geological, hydrogeological and hydrochemical study was carried out. Individual catchment areas were determined with a water balance/budget and groundwater tracing. The subsoils geology for each <b>spring</b> <b>catchment</b> were mapped at the 1 : 10, 560 scale and digitised to the 1 : 25, 000 scale with AutoCad™ and Arclnfo™.

Field measurements and laboratory based chemistry analyses of the springs were undertaken by personnel from both the EPA Regional Laboratory in Castlebar, Co.

In order to better characterize a sandy aquifer that is affected by diffuse pollution (Brévilles <b>spring</b> <b>catchment,</b> Val d'Oise, France), and to quantify the transfer time in the saturated zone, a multi-tracer test involving a new technique, the ‘finite volume point dilution method', has been performed in natural flow conditions. In November 2005, injections of four different tracers took place in four piezometers involving different locations and depths in the aquifer. Recovery of the tracers was observed at two different places near the aquifer outlet. A particularly long and unusual monitoring exercise (27 months) demonstrated the existence of several different velocities within the sandy layer, {{which seems to be}} linked to the decrease of hydraulic conductivity with depth. The new insight and parameter quantification brought by interpretation of these tests contribute to a better characterization of the saturated zone.

It is also possible to determine dynamic groundwater volumes in a karst <b>spring</b> <b>catchment</b> area, the water budget equation parameters and the like. It should be noted that a sufficiently long data set is deemed to be a continuous spring discharge time series of more than 30 years. Such time series are rare in Serbia. They are generally much shorter (less than 15 years), and the respective catchment areas therefore fall into the “ungauged” category. In order to extend existing karst spring discharge time series, we developed a model whose outputs, apart from mean monthly spring discharges, include daily real evapotranspiration rates, catchment size and dynamic volume variation during the analytical period. So far the model has solely been used to assess the discharge regime and water budget of karst springs. The present paper aims to demonstrate that the model also yields good results in the case of springs that drain aquifers developed in marbles.

40|$|The {{contribution}} aims {{to illustrate}} {{the importance of the}} main climatic, geological and hydrogeological features of the karst landscape, in relation to both floral and faunal biodiversity and to human activities (i. e. grazing management). The geomorphological features of the karst landscape derive from the interaction between climatic factors (e. g. meteorological agents), geological setting, and rock mass properties (mainly solubility). Water represents a key element in this landscape and the absence/scarcity of surface water bodies influences land use and human activities as well as the floral and faunal biodiversity. The high porosity and solubility of the calcareous rocks bring about a rapid and consistent infiltration of water into the ground with the development of cavities within which there is a rapid turnover of groundwater. The high vulnerability of this groundwater and the strategic importance of karst springs (often used for public water supply) demand a sound knowledge of the karst aquifer system in order to protect and preserve water resources.

40|$|The {{impairment}} of water quality by faecal pollution {{is a global}} public health concern. Microbial source tracking methods help to identify faecal sources but the few recent quantitative microbial source tracking applications disregarded catchment hydrology and pollution dynamics. This quantitative microbial source tracking study, conducted in a large karstic <b>spring</b> <b>catchment</b> potentially influenced by humans and ruminant animals, {{was based on a}} tiered sampling approach: a 31 -month water quality monitoring (Monitoring) covering seasonal hydrological dynamics and an investigation of flood events (Events) as periods of the strongest pollution. The detection of a ruminant-specific and a human-specific faecal Bacteroidetes marker by quantitative real-time PCR was complemented by standard microbiological and on-line hydrological parameters. Both quantitative microbial source tracking markers were detected in spring water during Monitoring and Events, with preponderance of the ruminant-specific marker. Applying multiparametric analysis of all data allowed linking the ruminant-specific marker to general faecal pollution indicators, especially during Events. Up to 80 % of the variation of faecal indicator levels during Events could be explained by ruminant-specific marker levels proving the dominance of ruminant faecal sources in the catchment. Furthermore, soil was ruled out as a source of quantitative microbial source tracking markers.

The structure of their shallow subsurface affects water balance, e. g. infiltration, retention, and runoff. Nevertheless, there is still a gap of knowledge of the hydrological dynamics on hillslopes, notably {{due to the lack of}} generalization and transferability. To improve the knowledge of hydrological responses on hillslopes with periglacial cover beds, hydrometrical measurements have been carried out on a small <b>spring</b> <b>catchment</b> in the eastern Ore Mountains since November 2007. In addition, surface ERT measurements of several profiles were applied to enhance resolution of punctual hydrometric data.

To obtain the link between water content and resistivity, the parameters of Archie's law were determined using different core samples. To optimize inversion parameters and methods, the derived spatial and temporal water content distribution was compared to tensiometer data and resulting in remarkable coincidence. The measured resistivity shows a close correlation with precipitation. Depending on the amount and intensity of rain, different depths were affected by seepage water. Three different types of response to different amounts of precipitation (small, medium, high), could be differentiated.

A comprehensive study of water yield characteristics is imperative, especially in water-limited semiarid regions. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine spring flow and vegetation cover in a first-order watershed and investigate the herbaceous community structure of upland riparian zones. This study consists of two major components: (1) the effects of environmental factors and vegetation cover on spring flow at Pedernales River upland catchments, and (2) the ecological responses of vegetation to altered flow regimes that result from brush management at the upland riparian zones. The study finds that an average of 3. 67 % of the monthly water budget of first-order catchments in central Texas is made up of spring flow. The influence of woody plant cover on streamflow was evaluated by comparing spring sites with different percentages of woody cover three times during 2003 and 2004. Our findings indicate that changes in woody plant cover had no influence on the amounts of streamflow from these catchments, and the surface catchment area had only a minor influence. This suggests that the real <b>spring</b> <b>catchment</b> area might be different from the surface watershed boundaries that have been delineated by topography. Plant species richness and diversity gradually decreased with increasing lateral distances from the stream bank. Herbaceous richness and diversity declined with increasing Ashe juniper cover in the riparian zone. Ashe juniper canopy cover had a larger effect on the understory composition than the cover of other woody species. Herbaceous diversity and production was greater in areas with sparse tree density than in areas with no trees, but was lowest at high tree densities. The complete removal of Ashe juniper in the riparian zones is not recommended because of the potential loss of grass cover.

The traditional <b>Spring</b> Creek <b>catchment</b> is currently severed by Griffin Road. The flows to the South of Griffin Road, instead of crossing at this point, are diverted along Griffin Road towards Tolga. It is proposed to utilise an existing drain half way up Griffin Road, which is currently disused to divert {{a portion of the}} traditional flows, currently severed, to the North back into Spring Creek, hence reducing the flows into Tolga. The existing drain will require earthworks to the upstream end to ensure drainage capacity to a Q 100 level, along with a detention basin constructed on Spring Creek to limit peak flows to their current level, hence reducing the risk of flooding or erosion downstream. Prior to flows being diverted an isolated area of erosion would need to be stabilised. The proposal was conveyed to residents living adjacent to the proposed flow path to assess their response.

40|$|A {{key problem}} in {{environmental}} science and in engineering geology is the often incomplete {{understanding of the}} origin of dissolved components in groundwater. The dissolved contents of trace elements in groundwater are of special importance for groundwater quality control. The AQUITYP project aims to establish a detailed typology of recent groundwaters based on their geogenic trace element compositions, and to derive a so-called "geo-reference" for groundwaters from five principal aquifer lithologies in the Alpine belt. This geo-reference provides a database for investigations related to groundwater contamination, groundwater resources management and engineering geology. Groundwaters from crystalline, carbonate, and evaporite rocks, as well as molasse and flysch sediments in Switzerland and in neighbouring countries were sampled and documented by previous researchers (Dubois, 1993; Dematteis, 1995; Mandia, 1993; Hesske, 1995; Basabe, 1993). Based on a statistical analysis of the data and examination of the relationship between aquifer lithology and chemical groundwater composition these researchers identified a number of characteristic tracer elements (geogenic tracers). The present study includes (1) a synthesis of the hydrogeology and the hydrochemistry of recent groundwaters in these five aquifer types based on groundwater data acquired within the AQUITYP project, and (2) a hydro-geochemical investigation of the origin and chemical behaviour of the geogenic tracer chromium, based on a comprehensive field and laboratory study. To enable a comparison of the chemical groundwater data gathered and analysed over a time span of 20 years, a rigorous quality control of the entire database was made. An assessment was made of the sampling techniques, the sample treatment and the analytical methods applied in the AQUITYP project since 1981. Different tests were carried out to evaluate the quality and comparability of the data, including geochemical model calculations, comparison of different analytical techniques, and tests to estimate the influence of the filtration procedure. In order to make this large number of quality controlled data accessible also for future investigations, a groundwater data storage system was developed (AQUITYP-DataBase). 1.) Typology of recent groundwaters In the synthesis of groundwater hydrochemistry, the emphasis was laid on the hydro-geochemical evolution leading to the characteristic groundwater composition in each of the five aquifer types. Chemical characteristics and differences between the groundwaters from the different aquifer types were identified and natural concentration ranges for each aquifer type derived. The proposed geogenic tracers were evaluated and the potential sources of these tracers identified. The dominant processes leading to the typical mineralisation of recent groundwaters were investigated using geochemical modelling strategies. Finally, the concentrations of chemical elements in the groundwaters from the different aquifer types were compared to the Swiss drinking water standards in order to assess the quality of the investigated groundwaters. It has been found that each rock type contributes in a characteristic way to the major and trace element composition of the corresponding groundwater: The groundwaters derived from the crystalline Mont-Blanc and Aiguilles-Rouges massifs are characterised by a low total mineralisation (TDS 22 to 158 mg/L) dominated by Ca 2 +, Na+, Mg 2 +, alkalinity, SO 42 -, and F- (Ca-Na-HCO 3,-SO 4, waters). Elevated amounts of Mo, U, W, and As occur. These groundwaters derive their mineralisation mainly from the interaction with hydrothermal minerals present along fractures. Fractures act as major groundwater flow paths. Minerals relevant for groundwater mineralisation include carbonates (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, HCO 3 -), clay minerals (Ca-Na ion exchange), fluorite (F-, Ca 2 +), Fe-, As-, and Mo-sulphides (SO 42 -, As, Mo), and U- and W-minerals (U, W). In these crystalline groundwaters the natural concentrations of F- (23 % of the investigated springs) and As (7 %) exceed the Swiss limits for drinking water. In addition, the WHO guideline values for U are exceeded in 65 % of the cases and for Mo in 15 % of the cases. The carbonate karst groundwaters obtain their low to intermediate mineralisation (TDS 161 to 547 mg/L) from the dissolution of calcite (Ca-HCO 3, waters), as well as in certain regions dolomite (Ca-Mg-HCO 3, waters) and gypsum (Ca-Mg-HCO 3,-SO 4, waters). Together with their very short residence times, the carbonate karst groundwaters generally contain very low trace element contents. Nevertheless, geogenic trace elements occur in specific regions in relation with fossil organic matter (I, V) and accessory minerals such as barite in deep sea limestones (Ba), evaporite minerals (gypsum, celestite: Sr, Li), clay- and Fe-minerals (V), and Mo-sulphides and U-minerals in dolomitic limestones (Mo, U). In 18 % of the carbonate karst springs atmospheric derived Pb exceeds the Swiss drinking water quality target value. The groundwaters from Triassic evaporites in the Swiss Rhone basin are characterised by a high total mineralisation (TDS 760 to 2788 mg/L) expressed by elevated amounts of Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Sr 2 +, SO 42 -, and alkalinity (Ca-Mg-SO 4 -HCO 3 waters). Elevated amounts of the trace elements Mn, Ni, Cu, Li, Rb, Y, and Cd occur. The hydrochemical evolution of these groundwaters is governed by incipient dedolomitisation, involving dissolution of gypsum, celestite and dolomite and simultaneous precipitation of calcite. The Na+ and K+ contents probably controlled by ion-exchange reactions on clay minerals. Characteristic trace elements originate mainly from the dissolution of dolomite (Mn, Ni) and small amounts of apatite (Y, Cd), and from the oxidation of sulphide minerals (Cu, Ni, Cd). The elevated concentrations of the highly soluble Li and Rb may be related to brine inclusions in evaporite minerals and eventually to clay minerals. These evaporite groundwaters contain SO 42 - concentrations exceeding the Swiss quality target for drinking water in all springs, and the concentrations of U and Ni exceed the WHO guideline values in respectively 58 % and 2 % of the cases. In addition, Mn, Cd, and As concentrations exceed the Swiss quality targets in respectively 11 %, 10 %, and 7 % of the investigated springs. Recent groundwaters circulating in the porous and fissured molasse sandstones and conglomerates acquire their intermediate mineralisation (TDS 48 to 714 mg/L) primarily by dissolution of calcite and minor dolomite (Ca-Mg-HCO 3 waters). The particular mineralogy of certain Molasse formations is reflected in specific trace element compositions of corresponding groundwaters: ophiolite detritus in OMM sandstones in western Switzerland (Cr), barite fracture mineralisations in subalpine and folded Molasse units (Ba), granitic detritus containing sulphides (Mo), U-minerals (U) and abundant mica (Li) in the "Glimmersand" (OSM, Ca-Mg-HCO 3 -SO 4 waters), and evaporite minerals (Li, Sr), sulphides (Mo), and U-minerals (U) in the "Gypsum-bearing Molasse" (USM, highly mineralised Ca-Mg-SO 4 -HCO 3 waters, TDS 984 to 1346 mg/L). In these molasse groundwaters the Swiss quality target values for drinking water of Cr and Pb are exceeded in 36 % and 6 % of the springs, respectively. The U concentrations of 14 % of the molasse groundwaters ("Gypsum-bearing Molasse" and "Glimmersand"), exceed the WHO guideline value. The groundwaters from the "Gypsum-bearing Molasse" display similar quality problems as the evaporite groundwaters. Groundwaters derived from the shallow flysch aquifers in the Niesen and Gurnigel nappes are poorly evolved Ca-(Mg) -HCO 3 waters. Their low to intermediate total mineralisation (TDS 160 to 459 mg/L) is acquired primarily by dissolution of calcite and to a lesser degree dolomite. The low trace element content is dominated by Ba originating from barite fracture mineralisations. The poor chemical evolution of recent flysch groundwaters results from (1) their short residence time in the fractured flysch rocks, and (2) the absence of readily dissolving minerals except carbonates and barite. In 32 % of the flysch springs Pb derived from atmospheric sources exceeds the Swiss quality target value. 2.) Case study on the chemical weathering of molasse sandstone: Sources and chemical behaviour of Cr For the characterisation of the potentially toxic tracer element Cr a comprehensive field study was carried out on a selected catchment (Lutry <b>spring</b> <b>catchment</b> near Lausanne) situated in a molasse sandstone (OMM, Burdigalian). The investigation of the processes controlling the dissolved Cr content in these groundwaters was based on the groundwater chemical data, as well as on mineralogical, geochemical, and hydrological data. Relic Cr-bearing spinel and pyroxene in the sandstone were identified to be the primary sources of Cr. An electron microscope study showed that in the Burdigalian sandstone and overlying soil these minerals are strongly weathered. The slow weathering of these minerals is the major Cr releasing process. Under the oxidising conditions reigning in the investigated groundwaters, Cr prevails in solution in its highly soluble and toxic hexavalent state (CrO 42 -). In this case, retention by secondary Cr-hydroxide phases does not occur, as can be shown by geochemical model calculations. Laboratory leaching experiments were carried out with Burdigalian molasse sandstone from the field site, in order to support the field study findings and to quantify the processes responsible for the Cr mineralisation observed in the Lutry groundwater. Two experiments with mountain-wet oxidised and reduced sandstone were carried out over a time span of 2 months each, to obtain information about the influence of the oxidation state of the substratum on the mobilisation of Cr. The experiments clearly showed that the Cr-releasing processes are fast enough to explain the Cr contents found in the groundwater, and that the release of Cr into the groundwater depends on the weathering state of the sandstone. In the oxidised, Fe-hydroxide-coated sandstone, Cr is faster released into solution than in the less altered reduced sandstone. This indicates that the Cr contained in the reduced sandstone is in a more stable state, i. e. mainly incorporated in detrital minerals, while in the oxidised sandstone, the Cr is partly in an unstable state, i. e. adsorbed on the surface of secondary Fe-hydroxides, from where it is more easily leached...|$|E

Geologically, the catchment includes an ophiolitic complex outcropping in the north which is overlaid by sedimentary rocks in the south. The hydrology is driven by a Mediterranean climate, a mountainous topography, and a complex distribution of the hydrogeological properties resulting from the complex geology. To improve the understanding of groundwater hydrology of the Kouris catchment, 176 groundwater and precipitation samples were collected and their 3 H contents were analyzed. The three-dimensional 3 H transport in the groundwater was simulated by the PMPATH code. For numerical modelling, a regional input function of 3 H in precipitation was constructed from a linear regression between data for Cyprus and for neighboring meteorological stations. The calculated residence times for the groundwaters in the sedimentary aquifer and Pillow Lavas were greater than 48 a and were considerably greater than those of the ophiolitic complex (14 – 30 a). The calibrated aquifer porosities were in a range of 0. 05 – 0. 06. The PMPATH model was applied for delineation of <b>spring</b> <b>catchments</b> that were represented by quite narrow zones of lengths up to 5 km. Another contribution resulting from the 3 H analysis was {{a better understanding of the}} river–aquifer interactions.
