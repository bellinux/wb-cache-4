Butt got an immediate call-up for the national <b>side</b> <b>camp</b> where {{he was able to}} impress his case upon the selectors.

50|$|During the Battle of Fancheng general Xu Huang of Cao Wei {{was sent}} to oppose Guan Yu at Fancheng District. Knowing {{that most of his}} {{soldiers}} were composed of new recruits without training, Xu Huang did not go into battle straight away but camped behind the enemy to impose a deterrent effect. Meanwhile, he instructed his subordinates Xu Shang (徐商) and Lü Jian (呂建) to oversee the digging of trenches around the nearby enemy stronghold of Yancheng(偃城) to deceive the enemy into thinking that they were trying to cut off supplies into Yancheng. The enemies were deceived and abandoned their position, yielding Xu Huang a foothold on the battlefield. By then, a total of twelve camps had been gathered under the flag of Xu Huang. With the strengthened army, Xu Huang finally unleashed an attack on Guan Yu's camp. The enemy encirclement consisted of five camps so Xu Huang spread news that he was planning to attack the main camp while he secretly attacked the other four <b>side</b> <b>camps</b> instead. When Guan Yu saw that the four <b>side</b> <b>camps</b> had been destroyed, he personally led 5,000 horsemen to meet the attackers but was eventually outmatched. Many of his soldiers were forced into the nearby Han River and drowned. The siege on Fancheng was then lifted.|$|R
50|$|The Stowe CCC <b>Side</b> <b>Camp</b> {{is located}} in Mount Mansfield State Forest, {{on the north side}} of Mountain Road (Vermont Route 108), about 0.5 mi below the {{entrance}} to the Stowe Mountain Resort. It is accessed by a short gravel road that crosses the West Branch Little River, which separates the building from the main road. It is a two-story wood-frame structure, about 70 ft long and 20 ft deep, sited to give good views of Mount Mansfield. It is covered by a gable roof, pierced by one off-center interior chimney and another at the left end. Its facade is six bays wide, with the entrance in the center-right bay, sheltered by a gabled porch with rustic square posts. First floor windows are paired six-pane fixed windows, except the leftmost, which has sliding casements. Second floor windows are paired casement windows. The interior is rustic and simply appointed.|$|E

On April 2, 1939, Kofa National Wildlife Refuge was officially opened; Burnham gave the dedication speech. The desert bighorn sheep is now the official mascot for the Arizona Boy Scouts, and the number of sheep in these parks have increased substantially. The Kofa Game Range, as it was called, was originally administered jointly by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management. On February 5, 1975, Kofa was transferred exclusively to the Bureau of Land Management. [...] But in 1976 complete authority was returned to the Department of Fish and Wildlife Services and the Kofa Game Range was renamed the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E

5000|$|On November 15, 1990 {{three areas}} of the park were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Their {{historic}} importance is derived from their association with the CCC. The park {{was part of a}} larger study of Iowa's state parks called the [...] Area A focuses on a picnic area that includes the park's entrance portals, a picnic shelter, two latrines, three fountains, a footbridge, and the associated landscaping and trails. These facilities were built from December 1934 to April 1935. [...] Area B includes the bathhouse, restroom, and concession. Company 769 began construction of these facilities in May 1935, and the <b>side</b> <b>camp</b> completed them by September 1937. [...] Area C is the lodge or refectory. It was begun in July 1936 and completed in July 1937. [...] The Rustic style was used in the design of the buildings. The significance of this architectural style is that it was designed to blend into its natural surroundings by means of its material, design, and workmanship. [...] Areas A and B are historic districts, while Area C is an individual listing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{area was}} {{recommended}} {{for a state}} park site by J.N. [...] "Ding" [...] Darling. The city of Indianola acquired the first 560 acre in 1934, and it was known initially as Indianola State Park. From 1934 to 1937 Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) Company 769 and a <b>side</b> <b>camp</b> built facilities in the park. They constructed the dam and reservoir from April 1934 to July 1935. However methods at the time did not consider long-term effects of the surrounding 3321 acre watershed. By the 1980s sedimentation had shrunk the reservoir by 11 acre and agricultural pollutants in surface runoff had reduced the water quality. Various government and community organizations began working with neighboring landowners to improve Lake Ahquabi. Widespread adoption of soil conservation practices by local farmers {{and the development of}} buffer wetlands and sedimentation basins have halved the amount of sediments and nutrients reaching the lake. In the mid-1990s the lake was extensively dredged, the shoreline stabilized, the dam improved, and an aeration device installed. Game fish like largemouth bass, bluegill, sunfish, channel catfish, and crappie were stocked. After restoration Lake Ahquabi State Park's annual visitation and fishing use each increased three-fold. Anglers have been catching an average of 2.7 fish per hour, twice the catch rate of most Iowa lakes. [...] It has been estimated that the money brought into the local economy by increased visitation equalled the $4 million spent on the restoration project within 2 years.|$|E
