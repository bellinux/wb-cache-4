5|$|On May 17, 2010, Patti Smith {{received}} an honorary doctorate in fine arts from Pratt Institute, along with architect Daniel Libeskind, MoMA director Glenn Lowry, former NYC Landmarks Commissioner Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, novelist Jonathan Lethem, and director Steven Soderbergh. Following the conferral of her degree, Smith delivered the commencement address and sang/played two songs accompanied by long-time band member Lenny Kaye. In her remarks, Smith explained that in 1967 {{when she moved}} to New York City (Brooklyn), <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been accepted into Pratt, but most of her friends (including Mapplethorpe) were students at Pratt and she spent countless hours on the Pratt campus. She added that it was through her friends and their Pratt professors that she learned much of her own artistic skills, making the honor from the institute particularly poignant for Smith 43 years later.|$|E
5|$|Danielle later {{breaks down}} and tells Ronnie {{that she is}} {{pregnant}} by Paul, a barman she had a one-night stand with. She intended {{to tell him about}} her pregnancy until he reveals he has a girlfriend. Ronnie comforts Danielle and contacts Andy, suggesting that he take Danielle home but she resists in favour of staying close to Ronnie. She is dismayed when Ronnie confides in her that having her own child was the biggest mistake of her life. Danielle makes up with Stacey and decides to terminate her pregnancy. She is delighted when Ronnie accompanies her to the clinic but dismayed when she backs out of attending her second appointment. Following her abortion, Danielle visits her family for a while, but soon comes to miss Ronnie and Stacey and returns to Walford. Danielle becomes increasingly angry with Ronnie for rejecting her. She decides that she will tell Ronnie who she really is and leave Walford for good but Archie stops her when he learns who she is. Unknown to Danielle, Archie has told Ronnie that her daughter died as an infant, so in order to preserve his story, he convinces Danielle that Ronnie suffers from depression and she should keep quiet until he decides the time is right to make her revelation. Although Danielle continues to press Archie to reveal the truth, he repeatedly puts her off to maintain his lie. Eventually, believing that Archie has told Ronnie about her, Danielle tells her the truth but Ronnie refuses to believe her. Distraught, Danielle intends to leave Walford but Ronnie discovers that Archie has been lying and chases her. They are about to reconcile when Danielle is accidentally run over by a car driven by Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). Ronnie cradles Danielle and apologises for not believing her, saying that if she had known, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> given her up. Danielle passes away in Ronnie's arms as Roxy, Stacey and Janine watch on helpless, leaving Ronnie devastated. Danielle is buried and a grief-stricken Ronnie sings by her grave when alone.|$|E

25|$|Delany, in 2003, tried {{having an}} {{injection}} of botox in her forehead, but the needle hit a nerve {{and created a}} bruise which affected the muscle in her right eye, causing it to droop slightly.

25|$|Elisabeth did {{not provide}} police with more details until they promised her that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> to see her father again. Over the next two hours, she {{told the story of}} her 24 years in captivity. Elisabeth told the police that her father raped her and forced her to watch pornographic videos. To humiliate her, he made her reenact scenes from the videos with him in front of her children. Shortly after midnight, police {{officers}} completed the three pages of minutes of the interrogation. Josef Fritzl, aged 73, was arrested on 26 April 2008 on suspicion of serious crimes against family members.|$|E
25|$|Dina Matos and McGreevey {{separated}} {{after he}} {{revealed that he}} was homosexual, and in late 2005 McGreevey and Australian-American executive Mark O'Donnell began a relationship. The two lived in Plainfield, New Jersey. On March 14, 2007, the Associated Press reported that McGreevey was seeking custody of Jacqueline and filing for child support.

25|$|Daniel sells one of {{the houses}} from the estate, and Paul gives him a job as a salesman. Imogen voices her {{concerns}} about Daniel's changing behaviour, after he convinces Nate to buy a house knowing that certain amenities will not be built. Imogen tells Nate the truth and she and Daniel break up. Daniel also falls out with Paul when he admits to leaking Paul's files to the media. Daniel sees Paul receiving a loan from Dimato for Paul's new business venture. Paul tells Daniel to leave town, which he does without revealing what he knows. He returns with a new hair cut and wants to work at Lassiter's again. Julie Quill agrees to employ him. Daniel and Imogen eventually get back together, but when he works extra hours, she becomes dissatisfied and develops feelings for Tyler. She admits this to Daniel, who decides they {{take a break and be}} free to date other people, despite Imogen insisting <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> acted on her attraction to Tyler. Josh tries to convince Daniel to reconsider the break-up, but Daniel responds by criticising him for his failures as a father, before the hotel boiler explodes, trapping them both under a column. Despite knowing the column is the only thing keeping him from haemorrhaging to death, Josh asks Karl to lift it to save Daniel. Imogen later tells Daniel that Josh died to save him, and they reunite. Daniel is discharged after undergoing surgery. Imogen receives a job offer in Los Angeles and she accepts. Daniel offers to quit his job and go with her.

And having rapped it out, she prepared herself to stick to it. Nothing like leaping before you look.|$|R
500|$|Baird and Jackie {{were taken}} {{to live with the}} Birches and their son at The Dairy Cottage, which was owned by Mimi's husband, George Smith. At the age of 14 Baird was allowed to go into Liverpool city centre by herself, where she drank cappuccino coffee in the Kardomah Coffee House, {{although}} Baird and her friends called it [...] "frothy coffee". At 16, Baird started to hitch-hike to London, although her aunt never knew, as <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> allowed it. Baird talked about the trips to London, and how relatively safe they were: [...] "Hitching was easy then. It was a way of life. Everything was becoming more free. We'd start chatting to people in the Tube station and get invited to parties. People always gave us a place to stay â we were never harmed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Willy, {{fourteen}} {{years older than}} his wife {{and one of the}} most notorious libertines in Paris, introduced Colette into avant-garde intellectual and artistic circles while engaging in sexual affairs and encouraging her own lesbian alliances. It was he who chose the titillating subject-matter of the Claudine novels, [...] "the secondary myth of Sappho...the girls' school or convent ruled by a seductive female teacher" [...] (Ladimer, p.53). Colette later said that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> become a writer if not for Willy.|$|E

2500|$|On November 1, 2006, Shelly {{was found}} dead, {{hanging in the}} shower of her Greenwich Village work studio apartment.

[...] Police arrested a construction worker, an immigrant from Ecuador who confessed to killing Shelly and making it look as if she had committed suicide.|$|E
2500|$|Feeling <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> as much artistic {{freedom and}} {{independence}} {{as she had}} at that moment, Swanson decided she [...] "wanted to make [...] Gold Rush". Schenck pleaded with her to do a commercially successful film like The Last of Mrs. Cheyney. [...] Swanson felt it was too formulaic, and decided to call on director Raoul Walsh, who was signed with Fox Film Corporation at the time. Walsh had been known for bringing controversial material to film, and at their first meeting suggested the John Colton/Clemence Randolph play Rain (1923), based on a story by W. Somerset Maugham in 1921 titled Miss Thompson. She had seen Jeanne Eagels perform the role twice, and enjoyed it.|$|E

Accordingly, Carmen Polo {{became known as the}} first lady of Spain. She was generally referred to simply as [...] "La SeÃ±ora". Her glamorous persona became part of Franco's image. It is rumored that Jose Antonio de SangrÃ³niz, Franco's chief diplomat, was forced to cancel a reception before the Junta de Burgos ("Military Junta of Burgos", named after the town where it was formed) because Polo did not have suitable clothes for the occasion. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> this problem again. Beginning in 1936, she began to build up a large collection of hats, dresses, and pearl necklaces, the latter becoming her trademark.|$|E

2500|$|In 1927, Swanson {{released}} her first independent film for United Artists, The Love of Sunya which was filmed on her terms in New York City {{and was the}} opening night film of the Roxy Theatre.

2500|$|Dorothy and Pound {{moved into}} an {{apartment}} at 5Holland Place, with Hilda Doolittle, recently married to Richard Aldington, living in the adjacent apartment. Hilda was shocked and hurt when Pound married Dorothy, and even more shocked to find he rented the apartment opposite at Holland Place. [...] She and Dorothy were not on friendly terms, with Hilda writing of her, [...] "she is unbearably critical and never {{has been known to}} make a warm friend with a man or woman. She loathes (she says) children! However that may be a little pose. She is a bit addictive to little mannerisms. I don't think she can be poignantly sensitive or <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> stuck Ezra". When Dorothy came to in the small apartment she refused to cookâever. In fact, she never cooked until she was to forced to during World War II. Pound cooked in the larger room and worked in a small better-lit room. He made furniture for the apartment where they stayed until 1919.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{again at}} home in New York, she and her old friend screenwriter Frances Marion, worked on an unproduced play for Zasu Pitts. A few romances came her way, {{including}} Maurice Chevalier. Two Broadway producers had their eye on a musical version of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and brought in Joseph Fields as co-author. After initial stops and starts, Loos threatened to quit the production unless they assured her <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> to speak to Fields again. The show opened in Philadelphia with a then-unknown Carol Channing. By the time it arrived in New York it was another success. Channing soon was elevated to an A-list star, the show played for 90 weeks and went on tour for another year. The producers closed the show when Channing became pregnant. Herman Levin commented: [...] "I was convinced the show wouldn't work without Carol, and in my opinion it never has." [...] A musical film version was produced in 1953, directed by Howard Hawks and adapted by Charles Lederer. It starred Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe. Loos {{had nothing to do}} with the production, but thought Monroe was inspired casting.|$|E
