40|$|Transmission and {{scanning}} {{electron microscope}} studies of broccoli florets affected by head rot, at various stages of disease development, strongly indicated a bacterial etiology for the disease. Nevertheless, the different species of bacteria isolated from diseased heads, using standard techniques, failed to reproduce symptoms in pathogenicity tests conducted in the glasshouse and in the field. However, a modified isolation technique, using broccoli heads showing incipient watersoaking symptoms, yielded a fluorescent pseudomonad which reproduced disease symptoms readily in glasshouse and field tests. On the basis of physiological and biochemical characters, the pathogenic bacterium {{was identified as a}} highly pectolytic pathovar of Pseudomonas marginalis. The bacterium also caused the rotting of potato, tomato and <b>swede</b> <b>turnip</b> slices, and also of intact and detached tomato fruit. However, it was not pathogenic on lettuce, parsnip or lucerne, and also failed to rot carrot slices...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of seed chilling on the flower and seed formation of some vegetable and related crops was studied. The seed was germinated and then cooled almost to 0 °C {{so that it}} was still suited to mechanical sowing, a prerequisite if the technique were to be used in practice. This treatment was here called jarovization as introduced by Lysenko for wheat. The object was to bring certain spring-sown crops to flowering and sufficient seed production in the same year. Jarovization was only partly successful. Most of the crops under investigation still required a period of plant vernalization to behave as an annual. With beet (Beta vulgaris L.), black radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. niger), <b>swede</b> <b>turnip</b> (Brassica napus L. napobrassica), Belgian endive (Cichorium intybus L. var. foliosum) and some other species the jarovized crop ran completely to seed when an untreated crop of the same cv. sown on the same date yielded at least 15 to 20 % early bolters. The best sowing time for a full-grown seedcrop from jarovized seed was two, or, at most, three weeks later than from untreated seed. Many species could not be vernalized sufficiently until the young plants reached a certain age (juvenile phase), if they were to form flowers in ensuing favourable conditions...|$|E

40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Germany, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from BASF to modify the existing MRLs for pendimethalin in various crops. In order to accommodate for the intended uses Germany proposed to raise the existing MRLs to 0. 2 mg/kg on salsify, to 0. 5 mg/kg for the group of herbal infusions (roots) and to 0. 3 mg/kg on spices (seeds) and on caraway, whereas the intended uses on <b>swedes,</b> <b>turnips,</b> celeriac and celery were not sufficiently supported by data and no amendment of the MRLs was proposed. Germany drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005 which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to propose a MRL of 0. 2 mg/kg on salsify, 0. 5 mg/kg on herbal infusions (roots) and 0. 05 mg/kg (LOQ) on spices (seeds) and on caraway. The intended uses on <b>swedes,</b> <b>turnips,</b> celeriac and celery are not adequately supported by residue data and no MRL proposals can be therefore derived. Analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of pendimethalin in the crops under consideration, which are fully validated on salsify matrices; further validation data would be desirable on herbal infusions and spices. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed use of pendimethalin on salsify, herbal infusions (roots), spices (seeds) and caraway will not result in a exposure exceeding the toxicological reference value and therefore is unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|R

In order to accommodate for the intended uses of chlorantraniliprole, the United Kingdom proposed to raise the existing MRLs in carrots, beetroot, celeriac, horseradish, Jerusalem artichokes, parsnips, parsley root, salsify, <b>swedes,</b> <b>turnips</b> and other root and tuber vegetables, except sugar beet and radish, from the values of 0. 02 mg/kg or 0. 04 mg/kg (depending on the crop) to 0. 06 mg/kg and in oilseeds, except peanuts, soya bean and cotton seed, from the limit of quantification of 0. 01 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg. The United Kingdom drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA.

5000|$|Rutabaga {{has many}} {{national}} and regional names. Rutabaga is the common North American term for the plant. This comes from the old Swedish dialectal word rotabagge, from rot (root) + bagge (short, stumpy object; probably related to bag). In the U.S., the plant {{is also known as}} Swedish turnip or yellow <b>turnip.</b> The term <b>swede</b> is used instead of rutabaga in many Commonwealth Nations, including much of England, Australia, and New Zealand. The name turnip is also used in parts of Northern and Midland England, the West Country (particularly Cornwall), Ireland, Manitoba, Ontario and Atlantic Canada. In Wales, according to region it is variously known as maip, rwden, erfin, swedsen or swejen in Welsh [...] and as <b>swede</b> or <b>turnip</b> in English. In Scotland, it is known as turnip, and in Scots as tumshie or neep (from Old English næp, Latin napus). Some areas of south east Scotland, such as Berwickshire and Roxburghshire, still use the term baigie, possibly a derivative of the original Swedish rutabaga. The term turnip is also used for the white turnip (Brassica rapa ssp rapa). Some will also refer to both <b>swede</b> and (white) <b>turnip</b> as just turnip (this word is also derived from næp). In North-East England, <b>turnips</b> and <b>swedes</b> are colloquially called snadgers, snaggers (archaic) or narkies.|$|R

50|$|The crops most {{susceptible}} to P. brassicae damage in areas in Europe {{are those in}} the genus Brassica (cabbage, mustard, and their allies), particularly Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, kohlrabi, rape, <b>swede,</b> and <b>turnip.</b> The attacks to crops are rather localized {{and can lead to}} 100% crop loss in a certain area. In addition, because of its strong inclination to migrate, adults may infest new areas that were previously free from attack. Because many of the host plants of P. brassicae are sold for consumption, damage by these butterflies can cause a great reduction of crop value. Larvae may also bore into the vegetable heads of cabbage and cauliflower and cause damage. High populations of these larvae may also skeletonise their host plants. In present-day areas such as Great Britain, P. brassicae are now less threatening as pests because of natural and chemical control reasons. However, it is still considered a pest in other European countries, in China, India, Nepal, and Russia. In fact, it is estimated to cause over 40% yield loss annually on different crop vegetables in India and Turkey.|$|R

50|$|The {{principal}} {{reason for}} the large concentrations of Southdown sheep on downland farms over these centuries was {{their role in the}} maintenance of soil fertility. The large flocks grazed the open downs by day and at dusk they came down to the lower arable land for folding. The downland soils are chalky and not naturally fertile, so the close-folding by the sheep on small areas manured and trod the soil. This meant wheat could be grown successfully the following year. With the gradual introduction of new crops such as field <b>turnips,</b> <b>swedes,</b> kohl rabi and other forage crops, the folding system took off, increasing in parallel with expanding human population. The system reached its zenith from about 1845 to 1880.|$|R
50|$|Downy mildew is {{a disease}} of major {{importance}} on the horticultural Brassica species. It is most serious on the flowerhead types (cauliflower, broccoli), less serious on the leaf brassicas (cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and least serious on the root brassicas (<b>turnips,</b> <b>swedes)</b> and oil brassicas (rape). The pathogen persists as oospores in the soil. Attacks are most important in Brassica seedbeds, with infection appearing as yellow speckling of the upper surface of seedling leaves, and white mildew on the lower surface. Severely affected seedlings are stunted or killed. Similar symptoms appear on leaves in the field, causing premature senescence and favouring bacterial spoilage in the cold store after harvest. Affected Brussels sprouts show black spotting, which reduces their market quality. The heads of flowerhead brassicas can be severely affected, and become unmarketable.|$|R
60|$|Imagine {{that going}} forth! In their days the {{sprawling}} suburbs of Victorian times with their vile roads, petty houses, foolish little gardens of shrub and geranium, {{and all their}} futile, pretentious privacies, had disappeared: the towering buildings of the new age, the mechanical ways, the electric and water mains, all {{came to an end}} together, like a wall, like a cliff, near four hundred feet in height, abrupt and sheer. All about the city spread the carrot, <b>swede,</b> and <b>turnip</b> fields of the Food Company, vegetables that were the basis of a thousand varied foods, and weeds and hedgerow tangles had been utterly extirpated. The incessant expense of weeding that went on year after year in the petty, wasteful and barbaric farming of the ancient days, the Food Company had economised for ever more by a campaign of extermination. Here and there, however, neat rows of bramble standards and apple trees with whitewashed stems, intersected the fields, and at places groups of gigantic teazles reared their favoured spikes. Here and there huge agricultural machines hunched under waterproof covers. The mingled waters of the Wey and Mole and Wandle ran in rectangular channels; and wherever a gentle elevation of the ground permitted a fountain of deodorised sewage distributed its benefits athwart the land and made a rainbow of the sunlight.|$|R
40|$|Bulb {{brassicas}} {{are used}} as supplementary feed in intensive pastures systems. However, {{there is a lack}} of quantitative data to define their growth and development. This has limited the creation and use of prediction models and decision support systems. Thus a series of experiments were used to clarify the growth and development of bulb turnips. Thermal time requirements for developmental phases of bulb brassicas were quantified and relationships to describe the time to bulb initiation were obtained in field and controlled environments. In the first controlled environment experiment cardinal temperatures were determined from germination of nine cultivars of forage brassicas and daily thermal time accumulation models were developed for three groups of forage brassicas and ‘Aparima Gold’ swede (Brassica napus spp. napobrassica). These models allowed the calculation of thermal time accumulation in two field experiments. The first field experiment evaluated ‘Aparima Gold’ swede and ‘Barkant’ and ‘Green Globe’ turnips sown on five dates from November 2008 to March 2009. A second field experiment evaluated ‘Green Globe’ turnip sown on four dates from December 2009 to March 2010 under two soil temperature regimes (covered with plastic sheets and uncovered). A second controlled environment experiment evaluated phyllochron and hypocotyl thickening of <b>swede,</b> <b>turnips</b> and rape cultivars sown on four dates and in three temperature regimes using two glasshouses and an outside environment from December 2011 to March 2012. ‘Aparima Gold’ swede had a thermal time requirement to 50 % emergence of 83 oCd (Tb = 0 oC) whereas the turnip cultivars averaged 56 oCd (Tb = 3. 6 oC). Total dry matter production of bulb brassicas was described by logistic curves where leaf production was the main component of yield until bulb development started. From this point, leaf production stabilized until leaf senescence became predominant and bulbs became the main component of yield. Dry matter yields decreased as sowing date was delayed and that was related to the total amount of radiation intercepted. Radiation use efficiency of ‘Green Globe’ turnips increased with mean temperature at a rate of 0. 07 g DM/MJ total/oC, from 10 to 20 oC. Bulb initiation was botanically defined as when hypocotyl was 10 mm thick and occurred at ~ 760 oCd for ‘Aparima Gold’ and at ~ 390 oCd for turnips. Until bulb initiation of ‘Green Globe’, increases in LAI (0. 4 m 2 /m 2 /oCd) and in leaf production (0. 3 kg DM/ha/oCd) were observed. From this point on, the relationship between the ratio leaf:root dry matter production and accumulated thermal time followed an exponential decline (R 2 = 0. 99) with a base parameter of 0. 995. Phyllochron of brassicas was not constant across sowing dates. The phyllochron of ‘Aparima Gold’ swede ranged from 52 to 106 oCd/leaf, ‘Goliath’ rape from 42 to 92 oCd/leaf (Tb = 3. 9 oC) and for turnips from 20 to 67 oCd/leaf across field and controlled environment experiments. Phyllochron increased with mean temperature at a rate of 3. 4 oCd/leaf/oC for ‘Green Globe’ and 3. 7 oCd/leaf/oC for ‘Barkant’ turnips from 7 to 21 oC. ‘Aparima Gold’ and ‘Goliath’ also increased phyllochron with mean temperature (2. 0 and 2. 8 oCd/leaf/oC, respectively) but further studies are recommended to uncouple the effects of temperature and photoperiod...|$|R
40|$|Cationic <b>swede</b> and anionic <b>turnip</b> peroxidases were {{partially}} purified by ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography, respectively. Heat {{treatment of}} these enzymes {{and of a}} commercial high purity horseradish peroxidase (HRP) caused a loss of enzyme activity and a corresponding increase in linoleic acid hydroperoxide formation activity. The hydroperoxide levels in model systems increased only {{in the early stages}} of the oxidation reaction and then declined as degradation became more significant. The presence of a dialysed blend of cooked swede markedly lowered the hydroperoxide level formed. Analysis of volatile compounds formed showed that hexanal predominated in a buffer system and in a blend of cooked turnip. In dialysed blends of cooked swede, hexanol was the primary volatile compound generated. After inactivation under mild conditions in the presence of EDTA, the peroxidases showed hydroperoxide formation activity and patterns of volatile compounds from linoleic acid that were similar to those found on heat-inactivation. This suggested that calcium abstraction from the peroxidases was critical for the enhancement of lipid oxidation activity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
