5|$|Assuming {{that the}} {{equivalence}} principle holds, gravity influences {{the passage of}} time. Light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted, whereas light <b>sent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction (i.e., climbing out of the gravity well) is redshifted; collectively, these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift. More generally, processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation.|$|E

Kicker Steve Aponavicius successfully kicked a 37-yard field goal {{early in the second}} quarter. but after his secondkick was blocked, Boston College head coach Jeff Jagodzinski seemed reluctant to try long field goals and instead <b>sent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> offense to attempt to convert the fourth down. Out of four tries, only one fourth down was converted into a first down.|$|E

Four German divisions still held the ridge. In all, the actions around Verrières Ridge during Operation Atlantic accounted for over 1,300 Allied casualties.|$|E

5|$|Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten are {{constituent}} {{countries of}} the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and thus have King Willem-Alexander as their sovereign, {{as well as the}} remaining islands forming the Caribbean Netherlands. Aruba was first settled under the authority of the Spanish Crown circa 1499, but was acquired by the Dutch in 1634, under whose control the island has remained, save for an interval between 1805 and 1816, when Aruba was captured by the Royal Navy of King George III. The former Netherlands Antilles were originally discovered by explorers <b>sent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1490s by the King of Spain, but were eventually conquered by the Dutch West India Company in the 17th century, whereafter the islands remained {{under the control of the}} Dutch Crown as colonial territories. The Netherlands Antilles achieved the status of an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1954, from which Aruba was split in 1986 as a separate constituent country of the larger kingdom. The former Netherlands Antilles again split as three areas in 2010. The monarch is represented in each region by the Governor of Aruba, Alfonso Boekhoudt, the Governor of Curaçao, Frits Goedgedrag, and the Governor of Sint Maarten, Eugene Holiday.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} quarter, Maryland {{started with the}} wind to their backs. Bill Walker kicked a punt that pinned Oklahoma on their own one-foot line. Oklahoma quarterback Gene Calame rushed twice to gain some {{breathing}} room before the Sooners punted it away. Maryland took over on the Oklahoma 37-yard line. Quarterback Charlie Boxold completed a nine-yard pass to Dick Nolan. Halfback Chet Hanulak then connected with Nolan again. That {{was followed by a}} first down by fullback Ralph Felton on the Oklahoma four-yard line. Hanulak rushed to pick up twoyards. Nolan then ran to the left but was stopped by Oklahoma back Larry Grigg for no gain. Hanulak rushed again to pick up one more yard. Felton rushed from the one-yard line, but was stopped sixinches shy of the end zone, and Maryland turned over on downs. Maryland again drove inside the Oklahoma 10-yard line. Wilkinson <b>sent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> alternate line-up and Oklahoma again stopped Maryland short. The Sooners fumbled at their own 20-yard line, but the Terrapins again failed to capitalize.|$|E
5|$|Krueger {{accepted}} {{reports of}} a Japanese counterattack at Saidor, and sent reinforcements in response, but the attack did not eventuate. Because the 32nd Infantry Division was required for the upcoming Hansa Bay operation, he was initially reluctant to authorize it to block the trails behind the American beachhead. When he finally did so, it was too late. The retreating Japanese made good their escape, thereby defeating {{the whole purpose of}} the operation. The next operation, the Admiralty Islands campaign in February 1944, played out differently. Based on Fifth Air Force reports that the islands were unoccupied, MacArthur accelerated his timetable and ordered an immediate reconnaissance in force of the islands. Krueger <b>sent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Alamo Scouts, who confirmed that the islands were still well-defended.|$|E

5|$|On October31, a {{disaster}} declaration was signed for Honduras {{due to the}} effects from Beta. USAID sent $50,000 in funds {{for the purchase of}} relief items such as blankets, foam mattresses, and hygiene kits. Two Fokker F27 aircraft were also supplied to help assist the transportation of relief supplies at a cost of $40,000. The United States Department of Defense sent military personnel to the affected areas from November4–8. During that time, more than 155,000lb (70,306kg) of relief supplies were airlifted to the affected communities. The United States embassy in Honduras also provided a C-12 Huron aircraft to transport 3,000lb (1,360kg) to Puerto Lempira. A total of $500,000 was <b>sent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of relief supplies and transport to Honduras from USAID.

The World Food Programme pre-positioned 509tons (461.7tonnes) of food to be used in temporary shelters and recovery activities.

5|$|When news {{first arrived}} that Philip was in Elatea, {{just three days}} march away, there was panic in Athens. In what Cawkwell {{describes}} as his proudest moment, Demosthenes alone counseled against despair, and proposed that the Athenians should seek an alliance with the Thebans; his decree was passed, and he was sent as ambassador. Philip had also sent an embassy to Thebes, requesting that the Thebans join him, or at least allow him to pass through Boeotia unhindered. Since the Thebans were still not formally at war with Philip, they could have avoided the conflict altogether. However, in spite of Philip's proximity, and their traditional enmity with Athens, they chose to ally with the Athenians, {{in the cause of}} liberty for Greece. The Athenian army had already pre-emptively been <b>sent</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of Boeotia, and was therefore able to join the Thebans within days of the alliance being agreed.|$|E
