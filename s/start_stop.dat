5|$|Wind turbine {{design is}} the process of {{defining}} the form and specifications of a wind turbine to extract energy from the wind. A wind turbine installation consists of the necessary systems needed to capture the wind's energy, point the turbine into the wind, convert mechanical rotation into electrical power, and other systems to <b>start,</b> <b>stop,</b> and control the turbine.|$|E
5|$|Jet streams {{are fast}} flowing, narrow, {{meandering}} air currents in the atmospheres of some planets, including Earth. On Earth, the main jet streams are {{located near the}} altitude of the tropopause and are westerly winds (flowing west to east). Their paths typically have a meandering shape. Jet streams may <b>start,</b> <b>stop,</b> split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including opposite to {{the direction of the}} remainder of the jet.|$|E
25|$|Domestication is a {{fluid and}} {{nonlinear}} process that may <b>start,</b> <b>stop,</b> reverse, or go on unexpected paths {{with no clear}} or universal threshold that separates the wild from the domestic. However, there are universal features held in common by all domesticated animals.|$|E

25|$|The {{speed of}} {{rotation}} is given by the angular frequency (rad/s) or frequency (turn/s, turns per minute), or period (seconds, days, etc.). The time-rate of change of angular frequency is angular acceleration (rad/s²), This change is caused by torque. The ratio of the two (how heavy is it to <b>start,</b> <b>stop,</b> or otherwise change rotation) is given by the moment of inertia.|$|E
25|$|SVG {{images can}} {{interact}} with users in many ways. In addition to hyperlinks as mentioned below, {{any part of}} an SVG image can be made receptive to user interface events such as changes in focus, mouse clicks, scrolling or zooming the image and other pointer, keyboard and document events. Event handlers may <b>start,</b> <b>stop</b> or alter animations as well as trigger scripts in response to such events.|$|E
25|$|Graphical user {{interface}} (GUI) wrappers circumvent the command-line interface versions (CLI) of (typically) Linux and Unix-like software applications and their text-based {{user interface}}s or typed command labels. While command-line or text-based application allow users {{to run a}} program non-interactively, GUI wrappers atop them avoid the steep learning curve of the command-line, which requires commands to be typed on the keyboard. By starting a GUI wrapper, users can intuitively interact with, <b>start,</b> <b>stop,</b> and change its working parameters, through graphical icons and visual indicators of a desktop environment, for example.|$|E

2500|$|The PPE, {{which is}} capable of running a {{conventional}} operating system, has control over the SPEs and can <b>start,</b> <b>stop,</b> interrupt, and schedule processes running on the SPEs. To this end the PPE has additional instructions relating to control of the SPEs. Unlike SPEs, the PPE can read and write the main memory and the local memories of SPEs through the standard load/store instructions. [...] Despite having Turing complete architectures, the SPEs are not fully autonomous and require the PPE to prime them before they can do any useful work. As most of the [...] "horsepower" [...] of the system comes from the synergistic processing elements, the use of DMA {{as a method of}} data transfer and the limited local memory footprint of each SPE pose a major challenge to software developers who wish {{to make the most of}} this horsepower, demanding careful hand-tuning of programs to extract maximal performance from this CPU.|$|E
60|$|The few foot-passengers <b>start,</b> <b>stop,</b> {{and stare}} about them. Some {{windows and doors}} are opened, and people come out to look. It was a loud report and echoed and rattled heavily. It shook one house, or so a man says who was passing. It has aroused all the dogs in the neighbourhood, who bark vehemently. Terrified cats scamper across the road. While the dogs are yet barking and howling--there is one dog howling like a demon--the church-clocks, {{as if they were}} startled too, begin to strike. The hum from the streets, likewise, seems to swell into a shout. But it is soon over. Before the last clock begins to strike ten, there is a lull. When it has ceased, the fine night, the bright large moon, and multitudes of stars, are left at peace again.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the problem of}} <b>starting</b> and <b>stopping</b> a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process with fixed costs.

We rigorously prove that the optimal <b>starting</b> and <b>stopping</b> strategies are of threshold type, and give the analytical expressions for the value functions in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the dependence of timing strategies on model parameters and transaction costs. Comment: To appear in Risk and Decision Analysi...|$|R
