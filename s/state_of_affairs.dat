40|$|Abstract: We {{argue that}} consequentialism may seem attractive, despite the {{well-known}} case intuitions against it, {{primarily due to}} the idea that it is clear how we have reason to bring about good <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> but entirely mysterious how we could have reason to do anything else. We show that a deep theoretical connection between good <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> and reasons to bring them about can indeed be vindicated by the conceptual connections between good <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs,</b> fitting desires that they obtain, and reasons to act out of them. We argue, however, that the conceptual connection between fitting attitudes and reasons for action equally vindicates reasons to do things other than bring about the best <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs.</b> The fittingness <b>of</b> motives other than desires for good <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> – some more intimately related to morality than such desires-undermines consequentialism whether as a theory of rationality or morality. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{claims that}} events, facts and <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> {{need to be}} differentiated. It takes as a {{starting}} point Chisholm’s (1976) claim that only his ontology <b>of</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> explains effectively thirteen sentences related to propositions and events. He does this by reducing propositions and events to <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs.</b> We argue that our ontology also solves those problems. We defend a hierarchized Platonist ontology that has concrete entities (objects and events) and abstract entities (properties, facts and <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs).</b> The distinctions we propose allow us to explain the pre-analytic data analyzed by Chisholm without reducing entities. We claim that our ontology provides a different way of explaining that data, and is, thus, promissory. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

I. Why Consequentialism? Consequentialism is the view that what an agent has most reason or most moral reason to do is determined solely by the goodness <b>of</b> some resulting <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs.</b> This may take the form of act consequentialism, according to which one’s (moral) reasons to perform an act are determined directly by whether the act brings about the best consequences.

5|$|Because the {{receipts}} {{were initially}} insufficient {{to cover the}} six per cent dividend on the £5,697 that the Conservators had invested, they added the difference to the capital, so that the debt steadily increased.

After letters were published in The Field deriding the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> it was decided to unite the kicking game under one set of laws. By this time the FA Cup had helped the FA gain a dominant position within the game. The FA accepted the Sheffield rule allowing throw-ins to be thrown in any direction, as opposed to right angles only as prevails in rugby lineouts. In return the FA's use of a three-man offside was adopted.|$|E

The country's defence arrangements were in a poor <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> at the time but the NDL gained little traction with the Labour Government.|$|E

Smith recommended the relief of its commander, Major General Lloyd Fredendall, as did General Harold Alexander and Major Generals Omar Bradley and Lucian Truscott. On their advice, Eisenhower replaced Fredendall with Major General George S. Patton, Jr. Eisenhower also relieved his Assistant Chief of Staff Intelligence (G-2), Brigadier Eric Mockler-Ferryman, pinpointing faulty intelligence at AFHQ as a contributing factor in the defeat at Kasserine. Mockler-Ferryman was replaced by Brigadier Kenneth Strong.|$|E
