5|$|The quarks {{are held}} {{together}} by the strong interaction (or <b>strong</b> <b>force),</b> which is mediated by gluons. The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held {{to each other in}} the nucleus by the nuclear force, which is a residuum of the <b>strong</b> <b>force</b> that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article on the nuclear force for more). The gluon is a member of the family of gauge bosons, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.|$|E
5|$|The <b>strong</b> <b>force</b> only acts {{directly}} upon elementary particles. However, {{a residual}} {{of the force}} is observed between hadrons (the best known example being the force that acts between nucleons in atomic nuclei) as the nuclear force. Here the <b>strong</b> <b>force</b> acts indirectly, transmitted as gluons, which form part of the virtual pi and rho mesons, which classically transmit the nuclear force (see this topic for more). The failure of many searches for free quarks {{has shown that the}} elementary particles affected are not directly observable. This phenomenon is called color confinement.|$|E
5|$|A hadron is a {{composite}} particle made of quarks held together by the <b>strong</b> <b>force.</b> Hadrons are categorized into two families: baryons (such as protons and neutrons) made of three quarks, and mesons (such as pions) made of one quark and one antiquark. Of the hadrons, protons are stable, and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable. Other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and are thus insignificant constituents of the modern Universe.|$|E

5000|$|Strong nuclear force: Unlike {{gravity and}} electromagnetism, the <b>strong</b> nuclear <b>force</b> {{is a short}} {{distance}} force that takes place between fundamental particles within a nucleus. It is charge independent and acts equally between a proton and a proton, a neutron and a neutron, and a proton and a neutron. The <b>strong</b> nuclear <b>force</b> is the <b>strongest</b> <b>force</b> in nature; however, its range is small (acting only over distances {{of the order of}} 10−15 m). The <b>strong</b> nuclear <b>force</b> mediates both nuclear fission and fusion reactions.|$|R

Radioactivity can occur when the radius of a nucleus is large compared with the radius of the <b>strong</b> <b>force,</b> which only acts over distances {{on the order of}} 1fm.|$|E
5|$|In early September, the German Army {{had sent}} a <b>strong</b> <b>force</b> into San Marino to defend it against the Allies; this would also give them control {{of one of the}} major roads in the area, and allow {{artillery}} observers to occupy the mountain peaks. The defending force was drawn from the 278. Infanterie-Division, whilst the 4th Indian Division was assigned to attack it on the 17th.|$|E

5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A is {{the total number of}} nucleons. This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual <b>strong</b> <b>force.</b> At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.|$|E
5|$|David’s good {{fortunes}} {{changed in}} 987 when he, anxious {{to make his}} extensive possessions a hereditary Bagratid domain, joined his long-time friend Bardas Phokas in a rebellion against the emperor Basil. Once the rebels were defeated by the Byzantine-Rus' forces in 989, Basil dispatched a <b>strong</b> <b>force</b> under John of Chaldea to punish the Georgians, and David had to submit. Reconciled with the emperor, he was granted, in c. 990, the title of kuropalates again in return for his promise that upon his death the lands previously placed under his sovereignty would revert to the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
5|$|For TypeII supernovae, the {{collapse}} is eventually halted by short-range repulsive neutron-neutron interactions, {{mediated by the}} <b>strong</b> <b>force,</b> {{as well as by}} degeneracy pressure of neutrons, at a density comparable to that of an atomic nucleus. When {{the collapse}} stops, the infalling matter rebounds, producing a shock wave that propagates outward. The energy from this shock dissociates heavy elements within the core. This reduces the energy of the shock, which can stall the explosion within the outer core.|$|E

5|$|When Otho was {{defeated}} by Vitellius at the First Battle of Bedriacum, the armies in Judaea and Egypt took {{matters into their own}} hands and declared Vespasian emperor on 1 July 69. Vespasian accepted and entered an alliance with Gaius Licinius Mucianus, the governor of Syria, against Vitellius.

5|$|As {{the fleet}} {{continued}} south from the Cape in early June, Burrough in the Roebuck took a Spanish flyboat {{after a long}} chase that brought him near the Spanish coast. The flyboat's master revealed that a great fleet was prepared at Cadiz and Sanlúcar de Barrameda. Having received intelligence that Raleigh was fitted out with a <b>strong</b> <b>force</b> for the West Indies, Philip II of Spain had provided a large fleet to oppose Raleigh and to escort the rich East India carracks to port. Don Alonso de Bazán, brother to the Marquis of Santa Cruz and Captain General of the Armada, was to pursue and intercept Raleigh's fleet. As Burrough's men were burning the flyboat, part of the Spanish fleet was spotted, and Burrough, having rejoined his own fleet, soon sailed to the Azores.|$|E

5|$|Early on 10 June {{another group}} of thirty-one men arrived at the 9th Parachute Battalion position. These and other stragglers, who had arrived through the night, brought the {{battalion}} strength to around 270 men. At 11:00 the Germans attacked 'A' Company again, {{but this time the}} attack was ill-coordinated and was easily repelled. Shortly afterwards the battalion killed around fifty Germans, who had started digging defences {{in full view of the}} British position. Then 'A' Company ambushed a German patrol, causing several casualties. That afternoon a <b>strong</b> <b>force</b> of Germans occupied the Château and used it as a base to start an infantry and self propelled gun assault on the British battalion. With no mortar ammunition left, the British had to use their PIATs and machine-guns to stop the attack.|$|E
5|$|In {{a sign of}} {{problems}} to come, three Spaniards passing through a region near the Peñol de Cerquín were attacked and killed. This area was considered pacified, and the attack deeply disturbed Montejo, since similar incidents during his conquest of Yucatán had been a prelude to general uprisings. He rushed {{to the scene of}} the attack with a <b>strong</b> <b>force,</b> and summoned all the native leaders to meet him, in an effort to forestall rebellion. He investigated the attack and meted out punishment to the most guilty, then continued with conciliatory policies towards the rest of the leaders, who reaffirmed their loyalty. Montejo let the leaders return to their people, then marched to Comayagua to reinforce Cáceres, before returning to Gracias a Dios.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the Byzantine {{right and}} centre had been {{engaging}} in skirmishes with the Normans opposite them. However, {{with the collapse}} of the Norman right, the knights were in danger of being outflanked. At this point, the Varangians (mainly Anglo-Saxons who had left England after the Norman Conquest) joined in the pursuit of the Norman right. With their massive battle axes, the Varangians attacked the Norman knights, who were driven away after their horses panicked. The Varangians soon became separated from the main force and exhausted so they were in no position to resist an assault. Guiscard sent a <b>strong</b> <b>force</b> of spearmen and crossbowmen against the Varangian flank and inflicted heavy casualties on them. The few remaining Varangians fled into the church of the Archangel Michael. The Normans immediately set the church on fire, and all Varangians perished in the blaze.|$|E

5000|$|A second {{approach}} is to introduce explicit forces that work to maintain the constraint; for example, one could introduce <b>strong</b> spring <b>forces</b> that enforce the distances among mass points within a [...] "rigid" [...] body. The two difficulties of this approach are that the constraints are not satisfied exactly, and the <b>strong</b> <b>forces</b> may require very short time-steps, making simulations inefficient computationally.|$|R
5|$|Otho and Vitellius {{realised}} {{the potential}} {{threat posed by}} the Flavian faction. With four legions at his disposal, Vespasian commanded a strength of nearly 80,000 soldiers. His position in Judaea further granted him {{the advantage of being}} nearest to the vital province of Egypt, which controlled the grain supply to Rome. His brother Titus Flavius Sabinus II, as city prefect, commanded the entire city garrison of Rome. Tensions among the Flavian troops ran high, but as long as Galba and Otho remained in power, Vespasian refused to take action. When Otho was defeated by Vitellius at the First Battle of Bedriacum however, the armies in Judaea and Egypt took {{matters into their own hands}} and declared Vespasian emperor on 1 July 69. Vespasian accepted, and entered an alliance with Gaius Licinius Mucianus, the governor of Syria, against Vitellius.

5|$|The League of Nations lacked {{an armed}} force {{of its own}} and {{depended}} on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, which they were very unwilling to do. Its two most important members, Britain and France, were reluctant to use sanctions and even more reluctant to resort to military action {{on behalf of the}} League. Immediately after the First World War, pacifism became a <b>strong</b> <b>force</b> among both the people and governments of the two countries. The British Conservatives were especially tepid to the League and preferred, when in government, to negotiate treaties without the involvement of that organisation. Moreover, the League's advocacy of disarmament for Britain, France, and its other members, {{while at the same time}} advocating collective security, meant that the League was depriving itself of the only forceful means by which it could uphold its authority.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} protons and {{neutrons}} in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies {{because of the}} <b>strong</b> <b>force.</b> Nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, {{at the core of}} the Sun protons require energies of 3–10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the coulomb barrier—and fuse together into a single nucleus. Nuclear fission is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.|$|E

40|$|The escape {{process from}} the native valley for {{proteins}} {{subjected to a}} constant stretching force is examined using {{a model for a}} ? barrel. For a wide range of forces, the unfolding dynamics can be treated as one-dimensional diffusion, parametrized in terms of the end-to-end distance. In particular, the escape times can be evaluated as first passage times for a Brownian particle moving on the protein free-energy landscape, using the Smoluchowski equation. At <b>strong</b> <b>forces,</b> the unfolding process {{can be viewed as a}} diffusive drift away from the native state, while at weak forces thermal activation is the relevant mechanism. An escape-time analysis within this approach reveals a crossover from an exponential to an inverse Gaussian escape-time distribution upon passing from weak to <b>strong</b> <b>forces.</b> Moreover, a single expression valid at weak and <b>strong</b> <b>forces</b> can be devised both for the average unfolding time as well as for the corresponding variance.
