2500|$|The 1950s started poorly as {{the club}} reached 2nd place behind Råå IF; several {{injuries}} to key players disturbed the season, and in 1951 the club board decided to rejuvenate the squad and {{which led to}} a 7th place. In 1952 the club yet again ended up in 2nd place, the club also went on a trip, first to Germany, where they played a series of matches, and then to the French Riviera, where the club played a game and enjoyed the weather and beach, they then returned home and played a game against Brazilian team Corinthians with a mixed team of Halmstads BK and IS Halmia players, the Brazilians won with 10–1, <b>Sylve</b> Bengtsson returned from the 1952 Summer Olympics with a bronze medal. 1953 saw a change in the league system and Halmstads BK was lucky as the club was able to stay only because of better goal difference as 6 teams was relegated. Things changed in 1954 as Halmstads BK dominated the new league and won promotion with 12 points ahead of IK Sleipner in second place, then made yet again a trip south, this time to North Africa and Spain, bowling was added to the club. Halmstads BK reached their best position so far in 1954–55 season as the club ended up in 2nd place, winning Stora Silvret (eng: The Big Silver), then during 1955–56 season, Halmstads BK biggest victory was recorded as they club crushed Västerås SK with 9–0, Östen Ståhl scored 6 goals in the match, <b>Sylve</b> Bengtsson also became the league's top goal scorer with 22 goals, Halmstads BK ended in 7th position.

2500|$|The 1960s wasn't Halmstads BK's decade, {{the club}} {{ended up in}} 4th place in 1960 even after Kjell [...] "Lill-Goggo" [...] Karlsson and <b>Sylve</b> Bengtsson had scored 34 goals together, in 1961 the club ended up in 7th {{position}} after poor play, in 1962 the club went through a rejuvenation and only won 9 matches out of 22, making the club end in 6th place, then in 1963 two victories against Norrby IF and IK Oddevold helped the club to 9th place, this year saw ice hockey {{become a part of}} the club's organization. Halmstads BK won Division 2 in 1964, but in the new qualify for Allsvenskan, a group of the four different Division 2 winners, the club played poorly and ended up dead last. 1965 was the darkest year for the club so far as it was relegated to Division 3 for the first time ever in club history, it took the club 2 years to return Division 2 again after ending up in 2nd place both 1966 and 1967, then in 1968 the club dominated Division 3 and had a goal difference of 87–23, a record in the Swedish league system, the ice hockey left the organization and started their own.

2500|$|With only 3 {{point in}} total in all away games saw Halmstads BK {{end up in}} 6th place in 1970. The year 1971 was turbulent, as manager Janne Holmberg left {{in the middle of}} the season due to a dispute with the board. [...] Former top player <b>Sylve</b> Bengtsson {{replaced}} him and the club subsequently defeated Perstorp SK in the seriefinal, securing 2nd place and qualifying for promotion to Allsvenskan. [...] The spell in the top league lasted only 1 year, however, as the club ended up dead last, scoring only 14 goals that year. [...] 1973 saw the club again achieve promotion, this time under the leadership of Sven Agne Larsson, who led the club through 20 games in a row without a defeat. [...] The club spent the next two years in Allsvenskan fighting off relegation, finishing in 11th place in 1974 and, in 1975, only surviving by beating GAIS on goal difference. In 1976 Halmstads BK hired Roy Hodgson as new manager and success came directly as the club went on and won Allsvenskan for the first time ever, the title was won in the second last game against IFK Norrköping, the last match against Östers IF was seen by 16000 people cheering for the team.

Halmstads BK won their second title in 1979.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the ongoing}} Second World War Sweden focused more on {{military}} readiness {{in case of an}} invasion than on sport, this led to Halmstads BK being forced to use 29 different players during the season and the result came thereafter as the club ended up in 3rd place behind Malmö BI and winners IS Halmia. Halmstads BK was the superior team in 1941 Division 2 but failed to defeat GAIS in the qualify for Division 1. Halmstads BK won Division 2 after hard competition with local rivals IS Halmia in 1942 and in the qualify the club was able to defeat Lundby IF with 3–2.

Halmstad was close to fall out of the top division in 1944 but a series of victories saved them in the end. 1945 saw the club end up in 8th place. In 1946 the club ended up second from last after a poor season, however the club's youth squad won the unofficial youth championship, first defeating IFK Göteborg and then playing 4–4 against AIK in the final, winning on drawing the winning lot, in the youth squad there were players like <b>Sylve</b> Bengtsson, Gunnar Johansson, Olle Ericsson, Östen Ståhl and Åke Hallström, who all later became noted players in the club's history. Halmstads BK returned to Division 1 after only 1 season in Division 2, the club crushed Örgryte IS with 6–1 in the 1947 qualify, the team also played their first match outside Sweden this year, they defeated Helsingør IF with 8–2 and the youth squad won the youth championship again after defeating Djurgårdens IF with 2–1. Just like the year before Halmstads BK time in Division 1 only became 1 year as they ended up dead last in 1948.

50|$|It {{all began}} {{one day in}} the 1960s, when a group of friends just back from a fishing trip, {{approached}} local businessman Thomas M. “Tipper” <b>Sylves</b> with an idea they had been kicking around for a community radio station for Monroeville. <b>Sylves</b> was a prominent citizen in the community. He had been a coal miner, horse trader, lumberman, railroader, cattle baron and real estate broker, and he was always alert to new business opportunities - he listened.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sylves</b> and Lieb soon formed Monroeville Broadcasting Company, Inc. The {{next step}} was to find a location. <b>Sylves</b> set aside five acres of some {{property}} that he owned just off Strochein road. There they would build a seven-room office building adjacent to the entrance of the US Steel Research labs. The facility, with an initial investment of over $100,000, represented one of the most modern equipped stations in western Pennsylvania. The new owner-operators appointed Bill Lynch as station manager and senior announcer. Sharing the microphone with Lynch would be Ed McLaughin and Bob McKee, both well-known local radio personalities.|$|R
50|$|The {{first step}} was {{to see if there was}} an AM {{frequency}} available. Jack Lieb, an attorney who work with the FCC, was contacted; he found that 1510 on the AM dial had been frozen for government use, but was about to be released. Leib wanted to pursue the opportunity, but he needed financial backing, and that’s where Tipper <b>Sylves</b> came in.|$|R

5|$|In {{the romantic}} period, typified by <b>Sylves</b> (1927) and Volumes (1928), Rabearivelo's poems are shorter and reflect a purer form of {{traditional}} models. He identified {{himself and his}} work as post-symbolist {{in the early part}} of his artistic career. Regarding Rabearivelo's works from this period, editor Jacques Rabemananjara acknowledged the poet's evident talent but critiqued his over-adherence to form and poetic conventions at the expense of innovation and genuine self-expression.|$|R
5|$|In 1925 he {{published}} a historical novel called L'Aube Rouge ("The Red Dawn") {{about the last}} years of the Kingdom of Imerina.

Rabearivelo published his second and third poetry anthologies, <b>Sylves</b> ("Woodlands") and Volumes, in 1927 and 1928 respectively. He also published his second historical novel in 1928, L'interférence ("Interference"), which depicts the life of a noble family from {{the last years of}} the monarchy until colonization. Throughout the 1920s, he translated the works of foreign poets and writers into Malagasy, including Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Laforgue, Rilke, Whitman, and Góngora; he also translated traditional Malagasy kabary (oratory) into French for publication in French-language literary reviews.|$|R

Certain it is that he became penitentiary to Pope John XXII at Avignon, that he enjoyed much favour with this pontiff, and was employed by him to refute the claims of the antipope Pietro Rainalducci of Corbario. In 1333 Alvarus became titular Bishop of Coron in Achaia, and two years later was appointed to the See of <b>Sylves</b> in Portugal. He also served as Apostolic nuncio in Portugal, but was not created cardinal, as some writers have asserted. He died in Seville, where he was buried in the Monastery of St. Clare.|$|R
