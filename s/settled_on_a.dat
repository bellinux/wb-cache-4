5|$|After the {{evacuation}} of Dunkirk in 1940, the British Armed Forces wanted to adopt a submachine gun similar to the MP 40. The Royal Air Force sent a request to the Ministry of Supply for 10,000 British-made copies of the MP 40, but eventually they <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> copy of the MP 28, known as the Lanchester.|$|E

5|$|Despite having <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> new {{standard}} type, Gresley continued to experiment on individual locomotives, {{in one of}} which experiments ACFI feedwater heaters were installed in A1 2576 The White Knight and A3 2580 Shotover. However, on the Pacifics the increase in efficiency was deemed insufficient and the apparatus was eventually removed. In 1935, number 2544 Lemberg received Trofimoff piston valves of an ingenious design with automatically varying steam passages.|$|E
5|$|Mobile, Alabama, {{had fallen}} to Union control on April 12, 1865. Reports reached Taylor of the meeting between Johnston and Sherman about the terms of Johnston's {{surrender}} of his armies. Taylor agreed to meet with Major General Edward R. S. Canby for a conference north of Mobile, and they <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 48 hour's truce on April 30. Taylor agreed to a surrender after this time elapsed, which he did on May 4 at Citronelle, Alabama.|$|E
5|$|New Orleans was <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> natural {{high ground}} along the Mississippi River. Later {{developments}} that eventually extended to nearby Lake Pontchartrain were built on fill {{to bring them}} above the average lake level. Navigable commercial waterways extended from the lake into {{the interior of the}} city to promote waterborne commerce. After the construction of the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal in 1940, the state closed these waterways causing the town's water table to lower drastically.|$|E

5|$|The Chincoteague Indians {{gradually}} withdrew northwards in {{the late}} 17th century as European colonization grew; most <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> reservation at present-day Snow Hill, Maryland, with allied tribes of Native Americans, though some may have remained in their traditional area. They were later forced from the reservation, and their descendants are among the Nanticoke people in southern Delaware.|$|E
5|$|Valve, {{based in}} Kirkland, Washington, {{was founded in}} 1996 by former Microsoft {{employees}} Mike Harrington and Gabe Newell. For its first product, Valve <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> concept for a horror first-person shooter (FPS) using the Quake engine licensed from id Software. Valve eventually modified 70% of the engine's code, adding skeletal animation and Direct3D support.|$|E
5|$|A bill {{setting out}} {{arrangements}} for funding and building the fleet was finalized in mid-July 1914. At {{this time the}} Navy had not yet <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> final battleship design. It was planned that the first ship's keel would be laid in December 1914 and fitting out be completed sometime in 1918. The bill was not immediately introduced into parliament, however, as Idenburg was given until 10 August to comment on it. The outbreak of the First World War led to the bill being withdrawn due to the uncertain international circumstances and the impossibility of buying battleships from foreign shipbuilders in wartime. Instead, the Government ordered three s in 1915, though only two were completed.|$|E

5|$|During that year, Tesla {{worked in}} Pittsburgh, helping {{to create an}} {{alternating}} current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 60-cycle AC current system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found {{that it would not}} work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, Admiral Fisher was {{prevented}} from ordering an improved {{version of the}} preceding s by a wartime restriction that banned construction of ships larger than light cruisers. To obtain ships suitable for traditional battlecruiser roles, such as scouting for fleets and hunting enemy raiders, he <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> design with the minimal armour of a light cruiser and the armament of a battlecruiser. He justified their existence by claiming he needed fast, shallow-draught ships for his Baltic Project, a plan to invade Germany via its Baltic coast.|$|E
5|$|Ford Road {{was named}} for William Ford, father of {{automobile}} pioneer Henry Ford. The elder Ford was born in Ireland and settled in Dearborn Township in 1847. William's carpentry business lead him around to regional businesses and neighbors, traveling the area until he took up the family business of farming after marriage to Mary Litogot. They <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> farm near the intersection of modern-day Ford Road and Greenfield Avenue; this farm was Henry's birthplace in 1863. Settling into his family life, William started serving the local community. He was a road commissioner, school board member and a justice of the peace. In honor of his accomplishments, Ford Road was named in his honor {{before his death in}} March 1905.|$|E

5|$|Manager Malcolm McLaren asked {{architect}} Ben Kelly {{to refurbish}} a basement rehearsal room {{he had bought}} from Badfinger. The Sex Pistols rehearsed in this room, lived above No. 6, and recorded their first demos there. Johnny Rotten drew cartoons of the members as graffiti which was later revealed in an archaeological survey of the site. Scott Gorham bought his first guitar with Thin Lizzy on Denmark Street. He had turned up at the audition with a Japanese Les Paul Copy—when he got the job, Phil Lynott took him shopping on Denmark Street. After being told several guitars were too expensive, he <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Sunburst Gibson Les Paul Deluxe. Andy's Guitars was established in 1978 at No. 27 and survived for many years before closing in 2007 because of increased shop rates.|$|E
5|$|Remember Me was {{developed}} as the debut project of Dontnod Entertainment, {{with one of}} the company's founding members Jean-Maxime Moris as its director. Part of his goal for the game was to create a thought-provoking narrative, and eventually <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> female protagonist to help convey the story's themes. Originally a PlayStation 3-exclusive under Sony titled Adrift, it was cancelled in 2011 and later purchased by Capcom which resurrected it as a multiplatform game. General praise was given for the world design, Olivier Deriviere's soundtrack, the ambition of the story and the Memory Remix segments, while the main criticisms laid against other aspects of the story, poor design choices and formulaic combat.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War necessitated a new aerodrome for the Royal Flying Corps. The Corps had received the Royal Warrant on 13 April 1912, whereupon Major Sefton Brancker of the War Office conducted aerial surveys in 1914 of Glebe Farm in Ickenham, and Hundred Acres Farm and Down Barnes Farm in Ruislip, looking for the most effective operating base for new squadrons. He <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> site near Northolt Junction railway station {{but it was not}} until January 1915 that the British government officially requisitioned the land. It is rumoured that the government official tasked with acquiring the land arrived at the site with his map upside down, leading to the government requisitioning and developing land on the wrong side of the railway line, including the old Hill Farm.|$|E

He became wealthy when a moderate deposit {{of oil and}} natural gas was discovered on his farm; when he sold the property in 1827 it earned $25,000, $ in 2015 chained dollars. The money allowed him to purchase a modest estate and {{spend the rest of his}} life as an active member of the Indiana Democratic Party, serving as an Indiana State Senator, party chairman, and financial contributor. He was also able to send his only child, Daniel, to medical school.|$|E
5|$|When Rovio {{began writing}} new {{versions}} of the game for other devices, new issues came to light. As the team began working on a version for Android systems, they observed {{the large number of}} configurations of device types and {{versions of the}} Android software. The number of combinations of software version, processor speed and even user interfaces was significantly larger than that for the iOS version. Ultimately, the team <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> minimum set of requirements, even though that left nearly 30 types of Android phones unable to run the game, including some newly released phones. It was released on October 15, 2010. One month after the initial release on Android, Rovio Mobile began designing a lite version of the game for these other devices.|$|E
5|$|A list of {{necessary}} equipment was compiled by 1 August and included, among other things, massive cables, capstans, pulleys, and 40 pounds of tallow for lubrication. The proposed salvage team comprised 30 Venetian mariners and a Venetian carpenter with 60 English sailors to serve them. The two ships {{to be used}} as hulks were Jesus of Lübeck and Samson, each of 700tons burthen and similar in size to the Mary Rose. Brandon was so confident of success that he reassured the king that it would only be a matter of days before they could raise the Mary Rose. The optimism proved unfounded. Since the ship had settled at a 60-degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into the clay of the seabed. This made it virtually impossible to pass cables under the hull and required far more lifting power than if the ship had <b>settled</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> hard seabed. An attempt to secure cables to the main mast appears only to have resulted in its being snapped off.|$|E
