Brown or tan boots can be authorized for wear with the Type II and III, though black is the standard color for sailors located in the contiguous United States. Boots come in two versions: black smooth leather boots, and black suede no-shine boots for optional wear while assigned to non-shipboard commands.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{shoelaces}} {{were made}} of leather, cotton, jute, hemp, or other materials used {{in the manufacture of}} rope. Modern shoelaces often incorporate various synthetic fibers, which are generally more slippery and thus more prone to coming undone than those made from traditional fibers. On the other hand, smooth synthetic shoelaces generally have a less rough appearance, suffer less wear from friction, and are less susceptible to rotting from moisture. Specialized fibers like flame resistant nomex are applied in <b>safety</b> <b>boots</b> for firefighters.|$|E

50|$|Motorcycle {{boots are}} {{associated}} with motorcycle riders and range from above ankle to below knee boots. They have an outside of a typical boot but a low heel to control the motorcycle.To improve motorcycle <b>safety,</b> motorcycle <b>boots</b> are generally made from a thick, heavy leather and may include energy absorbing and load spreading padding, metal, plastic and/or composite materials to protect the motorcycle rider's feet, ankles and legs in an accident. For use in wet weather, some boots have a waterproof membrane lining such as Gore-Tex or SympaTex.|$|R
40|$|The study {{assesses the}} {{effects of climate change}} on police {{operation}} in Delta state. To achieve this climate, data were extracted from the archives of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and the Met Station of the Department of Geography Delta State University Abraka, and police operation data were collected from the archive of the police diary at the state police headquarter. The results showed an evidence of climate change in delta state with a rise of 3 ˚C in temperature, and decadal rainfall increase of 120 mm; 56 mm and 121 mm in three epochs (1975 - 1984, 1985 - 1994 and 1995 - 2014). The first and last decades are wetter than the second epoch. There is a general in-crease in annual Police and vigilant operations from 1975 to 2014 and their operations are signif-icantly dependent on increase in rainfall and rise in temperature. Thus increase in rainfall and rise in temperature bring corresponding reduction in police and local vigilante operations in the state. It therefore recommended that federal and state government should provide rain coat, <b>safety</b> <b>boot,</b> umbrella, good vehicles to police on duty; and police and vigilante should embark on regular patrol be it raining or sunny day. This is because crimes (breaking and entry, armed rob-bery etc.) increase when it is raining heavily...|$|R

50|$|Magnesium oxalate is a {{skin and}} eye irritant. If inhaled, it will irritate the lungs and mucous membranes. Magnesium oxalate has no known chronic effects nor any {{carcinogenic}} effects. If magnesium oxalate does {{come in contact}} with skin or eyes, flush with water for at least 15 minutes and call a physician if irritation occurs. If inhaled, go to fresh air and call a physician. If swallowed, call a physician immediately. If a spill occurs wash with water and make sure that no dust is released into the air. Dispose of the wash water accordingly. Whenever working with magnesium oxalate, <b>safety</b> goggles, <b>boots,</b> and a lab apron should be worn. If there is dust in the air, a respirator should be worn also. Magnesium oxalate is non-flammable and stable, but in fire conditions it will give off toxic fumes. According to OSHA, magnesium oxalate is considered to be hazardous.|$|R
50|$|On September 30, 2008, Curcio, dressed identically to his decoy applicants, {{pretended to}} work the grounds near the bank. Wearing a blue shirt, jeans, yellow <b>safety</b> vest, work <b>boots</b> and painter’s mask, he pepper-sprayed the Brink's armored-car guard who was pushing a dolly loaded with money into the bank. The pepper spray forced the guard to reach for his eyes and release the cart that held the money. Curcio grabbed two bags of money, {{containing}} more than $400,000, and ran toward the creek. Meanwhile, police arrived to find the bank’s parking lot filled with men matching the robber’s description.|$|R
50|$|To {{fasten the}} binding, the spring {{assembly}} was lifted, sliding on a plastic disk. After being raised slightly it could move forward, releasing all {{tension on the}} clips. A metal clip prevented it from moving under the boot area, while also acting as a mounting spot for a <b>safety</b> strap. The <b>boot</b> could then be forced onto the angled upper area of the clips, forcing them to open outward, and then fastened by pushing the spring back down to re-apply tension. Step-in action in the S-2/3/4 series was accomplished by a small spring-loaded pin catch on the cams. When the spring assembly was lifted, the pin was forced upward into a hole on the T-arm running to the spring, holding it forward. When the skier stepped in, the pin would be pushed down and release the arm, springing the clips closed. The S-9 model improved on this using a large lever over the spring assembly that released spring pressure by pushing the spring forward when it was pushed down with a ski pole. The lever also had a finger that pressed up on the sole of the boot, helping it pop open the clips. This gave the system true step-in, step-out behaviour.|$|R

40|$|Sharps {{are among}} the most {{hazardous}} wastes generated in health care facilities. Syringes for injection is among the common sharps generated during diagnosis, prevention and treatment. The risk is mainly due to the blood borne diseases that could be transmitted through t- sharp prick or puncture. In this study seven health facilities were visited in Dar es Salaam region & health workers from different departments were interviewed and some observations were made of the situation in those health facilities. The concern was mainly on the types of sharps, knowledge of workers on the possible risk due mishandling of sharps, the actual handling and disposal facilities & procedures in practice. Some photos and samples were collected. The findings were that the situation is good in hospitals and satisfactory in health centers. There was no big difference between public and private hospitals only that monitoring is high in private hospitals. Disposable devices were available, abundant <b>safety</b> boxes and <b>boots</b> for the waste handlers. The problem was on the type of gloves which were used, since they were thin and could cause sharps to easily penetrate and bring injury, availability of advanced syringe was more pronounced in public hospitals. Training was also conducted - though didn’t cater for all the health care workers.. Most of the health care givers were able to mention the possible hazards due to sharp Mishandling. Most knew how to handle and what to avoid but mistakes occurred due to negligence and poor monitoring. There is need for sustainability of all the necessary equipments as well as instituting the training and monitoring of Health workers on hazards of sharps...|$|R

50|$|Sturdy and {{comfortable}} boots or shoes are essential because workers {{are on their}} feet much of the day. Hiking or <b>safety</b> <b>boots</b> are preferred because they protect feet from injury. Open-toed shoes or sandals are not allowed because bare feet can easily be injured. An extra pair of socks is beneficial when it rains or is cold. Gloves of two types are needed. First responders wear welder's gloves or Nomex gloves protect their hands when pushing a hot car or removing a hot car part from the racing surface. Other workers may wear insulated gloves to protect their hands from the cold.|$|E
50|$|The Variable-Angle Ramp is a German-developed {{method for}} obtaining {{pedestrian}} slip resistance values. Flooring samples are mounted horizontally on the ramp tester and an operator clad in <b>safety</b> <b>boots</b> or bare feet performs a standardized {{walk up and}} down the sample while wearing a harness to stop the operator from being injured. The sample is slowly inclined until the operator slips on the surface. The angle at which the subject slips is then recorded. Two operators repeat this test three times and then an average is calculated. The repeatability of this test method was extensively documented. Tests can be performed dry, wet with soapy water, wet with oil, etc.|$|E

The growing influence {{of the environmental movement}} in the late 60s, coupled with the fuel shortages of the early 70s, had directed the utilities’ focus away from expansion and toward conservation. RKI began to advise its licensees on environmental issues, urging them to use the character to advance a message of [...] "environmental improvement." [...] Reddy Kilowatt clip art began to depict the character in various “green” poses: planting seedlings and installing energy-efficient lighting, for example.
