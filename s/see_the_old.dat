25|$|The {{history of}} Fort Edmonton Park's {{conception}} goes {{back as far}} as 1915. In that year, the remains of the old fort next to the Alberta Legislature Building were torn down, amidst opposition from citizens who wished to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> structures relocated so that they could be cherished for their heritage value. A renewed interest after the Second World War began the momentum that saw the park begin construction in 1969 {{under the direction of the}} Fort Edmonton Foundation.|$|E

The black stands for the enslaved Africans brought to Puerto Rico, many to Guayama. The yellow represents sugar cane industry in Puerto Rico and the significance of Guayama's sugar plantations. The red symbolizes the blood shed by Taíno Indians in their fight against the Spanish/European colonizers.

He warned of a 'tsunami coming' due the governing bodies' failure to address issues surrounding new golf technology. After the 2017 Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, Player reiterated these comments, taking to Twitter to say he was 'sad' to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Course at St Andrews 'brought to her knees' after Ross Fisher broke the course record on a day of very low scoring during the final round.|$|E
500|$|After {{viewing the}} pilots, CBS {{executives}} immediately signed the 30-minute show to its fall 1954 schedule. Pal retired after filming the two pilots, and his son, Lassie Junior (who {{was three years}} old and had been in training for a couple of years), stepped into the television role. [...] Pal would come to the show's studio home at Stage One of KTTV in Los Angeles every day with his son during filming. [...] He had a bed behind the set, and was respectfully termed The Old Man.

500|$|Sue Crawford of the Daily Mirror said, [...] "playing a ladies' {{man comes}} {{naturally}} to Nigel Havers so it's hardly surprising he's playing a flirt in Coronation Street." [...] Crawford's colleague, Simon Boyle, wrote that Lewis was [...] "charming but devious." [...] Havers' {{role in the}} soap proved popular with female viewers. The actor told entertainment website Digital Spy {{that he had been}} sent sackfuls of fan mail and underwear. However, other viewers were unhappy with Havers' character's treatment of Audrey and the actor received abuse in the street. In November 2011, Jon Horsley of Yahoo! said viewers should be excited about Lewis' return to Coronation Street. Horsely added [...] "It'll be great to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> smoothy back on the cobbles. We're really looking forward to Audrey's reaction to him, too." [...] Lewis' return to Coronation Street was selected for Digital Spy's Picture of the Day feature.|$|E
500|$|Arthur Byne, an art agent {{living in}} Madrid, whose biggest client was American {{newspaper}} magnate William Randolph Hearst, {{was working for}} Hearst to acquire an old monastery in 1930. In 1925, Byne had bought Hearst the monastery of Santa María la Real de Sacramenia which was dismantled, crated and shipped to New York where it was stored in a warehouse in the Bronx. (In 1954 it was re-assembled in Florida as a tourist attraction, and was subsequently acquired by the Episcopal Diocese of South Florida and called the St. Bernard de Clairvaux Church.) Byne signaled Beloso to help him locate one; Beloso invited him to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Óvila monastery in December 1930, and Byne subsequently sent photographs and sketches to Hearst for approval. Byne listed specific elements, mostly architectural details, to be removed, such as vault ribs, door frames, window embrasures, columns and capitals. Some entire walls of fine facing stones were recommended for removal. He referred to the proposal as [...] "Mountolive", possibly to misdirect the Spanish authorities who {{were in charge of}} protecting historical artifacts.|$|E

[...] After four weeks at the new camp, they were moved back to Sumatra by paddle steamer. They {{had been told that}} it was a [...] "special mission" [...] to pick fruit. Instead they spent a year in Sumatra, with the Japanese using the men to cut through the jungle to lay railway track. Rations were a handful of maggot-ridden tapioca a day, which Frank continued to share with Judy. She also proved useful in conducting trades with the locals, as she would indicate when someone was hiding near to the track. Her barking deliberately alerted the guards to when there was something too large for her to handle in the jungle, such as tigers or elephants.|$|E

[...] SuChin Pak, also from MTV stated the show was [...] "no huge revelation", explaining, [...] "It {{was not the kind of}} show that says: 'She's back.

These are all really tiny baby steps." [...] Thomas K. Arnold of USA Today said the show [...] "turned out to be more rehearsal than comeback", although [...] "all those post-rehab workouts were worth the effort." [...] On May 2, 2007, scalpers outside the House of Blues in San Diego were selling tickets with a face value of $35 for prices between $200 and $500. Chris Lee of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "her 'comeback'– if you want to call it that– cemented Spears' place as pop music's reigning drama queen, capable of capturing worldwide tabloid headlines with a bare minimum of creative expenditure." ...|$|E

In the past using the negative sentiment towards the colonial era was often used as an excuse to disregard protests against the demolition of historical buildings.

2500|$|Pius IX celebrated several jubilees {{including}} the 300th {{anniversary of the}} Council of Trent. Pius celebrated the 1,800th anniversary of the martyrdom of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul on 29 June 1867 with 512 bishops, 20,000 priests and 140,000 lay persons in Rome. A large gathering was organized in 1871 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his papacy. The Italian government in 1870 outlawed many popular pilgrimages. The faithful of Bologna organized a nationwide [...] "spiritual pilgrimage" [...] to the pope and the tombs of the apostles in 1873. In 1875, Pius declared a Holy Year that was celebrated throughout the Catholic world. On the 50th anniversary of his episcopal consecration, people {{from all parts of}} the world came to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> pontiff from 30 April 1877 to 15 June 1877.

2500|$|In the Ice Age Harringay was on {{the edge}} of a huge glacial mass that reached as far south as Muswell Hill. [...] The area was then largely covered with forest until the Middle Ages when it was {{developed}} as agricultural land. From 1750 to 1880 Harringay experienced the pressures of the burgeoning population in London. Gradually inroads into the pastoral landscape were made, first for the leisure and then for the settlement of Londoners. By 1900 Harringay had become a respectable outer London suburb with all the land built over and only Finsbury Park remaining as a hint of its former character. Identified as a single unified urban area from 1900, Harringay was originally split between the old boroughs of Hornsey and Tottenham with the boundary between the two running slightly to the west of Green Lanes The unification of the two boroughs in 1965, as the London Borough of Haringey, brought all Harringay under the control of a single unit of local governance for the first time in more than a thousand years. On many of the roads in West Harringay, it is still possible to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Tottenham - Hornsey boundary where the paving stones give way to tarmaced pavement. The old parish / borough boundary markers are also still in place on some roads (see picture, right).|$|E

2500|$|In 1925, Kirchner became {{close friends}} with fellow artist, Albert Müller and his family. Rot-Blau, a new art {{group based in}} Basle, was formed by Hermann Scherer, Albert Müller, Paul Camenisch and Hans Schiess, who all visited Kirchner and worked under his guidance. At the end of 1925, Kirchner {{returned}} to Germany and made his rounds to Frankfurt, Chemnitz (where he mother was living), and Berlin where he met with Karl Schmidt-Rottluff who wanted Kirchner {{to form a new}} artist's group; Kirchner politely refused. He then returned to Frauenkirch and wrote to Dr. Hageman on 26 March 1926: [...] "Now I’m sitting quietly at home again and I’m happy {{to be able to work}} undisturbed. I made a lot of sketches of life in Germany and it was very intriguing to see life there. I was also glad to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> pictures of Rembrandt, Dürer, etc. again and to have the confirmation and encouragement they gave me. As for the moderns, I saw damned little that gripped me". In December 1926, Kirchner's close friend, Albert Müller, died of typhus along with his wife, Anni Müller. In 1927, Kirchner organized a memorial exhibition for Albert Müller at the Kunsthalle Basel. There was a major exhibition of Kirchner's work at the schoolhouse in Davos; the reviews were positive.|$|E
2500|$|As {{stated by}} Eden Miller of PopMatters, the music video for [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] opens with Madonna {{in a motel}} room, {{getting ready for a}} night out, which was seen as [...] "simple and pleasant" [...] enough. After {{stealing}} a car from the motel parking lot, Madonna picks up an old woman to accompany her in her drive around the city, and it quickly changes from there. Madonna rams her Camaro into a car full of young men who were looking at her suggestively. From here, she tasers a man at an automated teller machine (ATM) and takes his money (which she later stuffs into a waitress's pocket), and scrapes a police car with her car as two doltish cops look on. She then pulls a realistic-looking water gun on two police officers, and sprays them with water before driving backwards into their car to explode their airbags. After mowing down some roller-hockey players in a parking lot, she steals another car and blows up a gas station, all while still accompanied by the old woman. Finally, Madonna slams her stolen car into a cement pole in an apparent act of murder–suicide. In the final moments of the video, we <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> woman and Madonna putting on protective body gear (shin braces and a body vest, respectively). Although having a vision of violence, [...] "Madonna's violent acts in the video are either shown from a distance or take place off screen, and although ideas and events are clearly indicated, nothing graphic or gratuitous appears," [...] as noted by Miller.|$|E
