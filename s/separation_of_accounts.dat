50|$|The module {{constructed}} by Lee et al. implemented a tilted mirror plate that was positioned underneath the sample substrate. This conductive mirror was tilted at 45° and successfully reflected the illuminating laser to a focused spot directly underneath the conductive tip. The steering mirror was {{employed as a}} means of controlling the trajectory of the laser source, with this addition the position of the reflected beam on the sample could be easily adjusted for placement underneath the AFM tip. The illumination laser source was a diode-pumped solid-state laser system that produced a wavelength of 532 nm and a spot of 1 mm in the sample.The addition of the mirror and laser underneath the sample substrate results in a higher scanning level due to raising the sample substrate. This configuration has no effect on any other instrument component and does not affect AFM performance.

As to capital market development, the key is to contract out pension fund management to professional asset managers, to support China’s major financial players, and to speed up the financial opening. At this point, investment of pension assets in mutual funds and a pilot program of private-placed, open-end funds can be initiated. ...|$|R

These constraints include metric switching costs between arms, delayed feed-back about observations, concave reward functions over plays, and explore-then-exploit models. These problems {{do not have}} any known optimal (or near optimal) algorithms in sub-exponential running time; several of the variants are in fact computationally intractable (NP-Hard). All of these problems violate the exchange property that the reward from the play of an arm is not contingent upon when the arm is played.

40|$|Introduction]. The soul-searching for {{a modern}} {{constitutional}} role for the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> powers doctrine {{has led to a}} number of theoretical conclusions, the most important of which is the "relativity" thesis offered by H. Kelsen. Approaching constitutional law with the instruments of his pure theory of law, his re-evaluation of the three classic governmental functions has given rise to a "relativistic turn" in the understanding <b>of</b> the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> powers doctrine: The <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> powers doctrine, so Kelsen argued, "presupposes that the three so-called powers can be determined as three distinct coordinated functions of the State, and {{that it is possible to}} define boundary lines separating each of these three functions from the others. But this presupposition is not borne out by the facts. (…) [T]here are not three but two basic functions of the State: creation and application (execution) of law, and these functions are not coordinated but sub- and supra-ordinated. " 2 The classic triadic organisation of public power is thus replaced by a functional dichotomy: law-creation and law-application. Absent any "natural" distinctions between the legislative and the executive branch, the character of each normative act is, according to Kelsen, "relative" in so far as its nature must be determined in relation to the status quo of the legal order. The three classic branches of government – legislature, executive and judiciary – share in the law-making function since they all may create legal norms. The concept of executive power is therefore also "relative", for each positive act below the constitution can be constructed as "executing" a higher norm in the legal order. 3 Two competing conceptions of the notion of legislative power have emerged in the modern era. The choice among the two is difficult as each has its respective advantages and advocates. The parliamentary conception of legislation has been innately tied to our modern understanding of who should be in charge of the legislative function. Legislation is formally defined as every legal act adopted according to the parliamentary legislative procedure. Parliament’s legislative power is viewed as unlimited and supreme. This procedural conception of legislation has traditionally shaped British and French constitutional thought and recently started to strongly influence German constitutionalism. 4 In materially defining legislation as legal rules with general application, the functional conception of legislation also appeals to our historical precepts. Indeed, the thought that a legislative act represents a general and abstract legal norm runs through legal history. 5 The requirement to decide specific cases according to general rules has been developed as a defence to arbitrary government in absolutist States. The constitutional limit on the legislature to adopt only generally applicable norms had been cultivated by classic <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> powers <b>accounts...</b>|$|R
