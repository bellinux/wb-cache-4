30|$|The {{first is}} a <b>single-stage</b> heat <b>pump.</b> This means that the compressor, present in all heat pumps, is capable of running at just one speed. It is the {{simplest}} and least effective technology available today. <b>Single-stage</b> heat <b>pumps</b> must be on at full capacity or off. Figure  2 shows the performance curve for the chosen single-stage heat pump—a Coleman TH 4 B 36 heat pump [10, 49]. The rated capacity is only available down to about 8 – 10 ^∘C. At − 12.2 ^∘C, the heat pump has reached its normal low-temperature operating limit.|$|R
30|$|Nevertheless, {{the absence}} of {{consolidated}} approaches in this field implied that a similar technology still today can be reputed only a scientific exercise, although there are numerous studies conducted also on experimental sites [9, 10, 11]. Pumps manufactures, indeed, usually do not provide information about efficiency of a pump used like a turbine. Various researchers indicated the <b>single-stage</b> centrifugal <b>pumps</b> as the optimal and most convenient choice for a PAT, operating, however, in a range from low-to-medium head [12, 13, 14, 15]. However, most of tests and experiments were conducted on horizontal <b>single-stage</b> <b>pumps,</b> although different types of pumps are available like multi-stage, vertical pumps, etc. Despite the numerous models and equations able to define the efficiency of a pump used in a reverse mode, this issue is still open and the efficiency of a pump when operating as turbine remains the main criticism that limits their application [16]. Moreover, experimental investigations are carried out to improve the PAT performances modifying impeller diameter and rotational speed. A simple reshaping of the blades of the impeller (with a blade rounding) can increase the PAT performances; in the same way, the greater size of the impeller increases its performances, due to {{the absence of}} a lateral passageway for the turbinated water (differently that in pump mode) and to a refinement of the inlet and outlet parts [17].|$|R

During full operation of the pump, the AMBs are used as actuators to generate defined motions respectively forces as well as very precise sensor elements for the contactless measurement of the responding displacements and forces.

Based on these functions, a model-based fault detection and diagnosis is developed which facilitates the detection of faults compared to state-of-the-art diagnostic tools which are only based on the measurement of the systems outputs, i. e., displacements.

40|$|Lecturepg. 69 A {{submerged}} electric (SE) pump {{has been}} designed and analyzed for high flow applications. The challenges when designing a high power density SE pump are torsional and lateral dynamics and hydraulic stability. The case discussed in this paper is a <b>single-stage</b> <b>pump</b> rated for 7000 m 3 /h (31, 000 gpm) with a mixed flow impeller and differential head of 65 mlc (213 ft). The increased flow design means that the impeller/motor inertia ratio increases compared to smaller designs. It is therefore important to review the torsional vibrations during start up when having direct online start. In this case the fundamental torsional critical was {{much higher than the}} main excitation frequency during start up, hence the response can be regarded as quasistatic. The main challenge with the lateral analysis was related to rotordynamic coefficients for the fluid filled clearances in the motor and impeller. The first bending mode was related to the motor itself, but with satisfactory separation margin from the operation speed. in addition, the response was highly damped. The impeller/diffuser interaction was analyzed with regard to flow stability. The diffuser can be a source for rotating stall that again can affect both vibrations and performance. Numerical flow simulations (computational fluid dynamics, CFD) were used to analyze the performance and flow at off-design. No sign of propagating recirculation around the circumference was detected. Additionally, casing/bearing house vibration analysis showed low vibration values and stable blade passing frequencies, confirming no blade stall interaction and corresponding diffuser instability in the flow domain of interest...|$|E
40|$|Solutions are {{presented}} for the dynamic axial forces developed by pump-impeller-shroud surfaces. A bulk-flow {{model of the}} leakage path between the impeller and the housing {{is used for the}} analysis consisting of the path-momentum, circumfer-ential-momentum, and continuity equations. Shear stresses at the impeller and hous-ing surfaces are modeled according to Hirs ' turbulent lubrication model. The governing equations were developed earlier to examine lateral rotordynamic forces developed by impellers. A perturbation expansion of the governing equations in the eccentricity ratio yields a set ofzeroth and first-order governing equations. The zeroth-order equations define the leakage rate, velocity distributions, and the pressure distribution for a centered impeller position. The first-order equations define the perturbations in the velocity and pressure distributions due to axial motion of the impeller. Integration of the perturbed pressure and shear-stress distribution acting on the rotor yields the reaction forces acting on the impeller face. Calculated results yield predictions of resonance peaks of the fluid within the annulus formed by the impeller shroud and housing. Centrifugal acceleration terms in the path-momentum equation are the physical origin of these unexpected pre-dictions. For normalized tangential velocities at the inlet to the annulus, UBO(O) = Ueo{ 0) /RjW of 0. 5, the phenomenon is relatively minor. As u 6 o(0) is in-creased to 0. 7, sharper peaks are predicted. The fluid modes are well damped in all cases. Numerical results {{are presented}} for a double-suction <b>single-stage</b> <b>pump</b> which indicate that the direct stiffness of the perturbed impeller shroud forces are negligible. Small but appreciable added-mass and damping terms are developed which have a modest influence on damping and peak-amplitude excitation frequency.

However, if containment of the spill area with simultaneous recovery is the target, then <b>single-stage</b> <b>pumping</b> still provides the optimal design.

The diffusion coefficient d is an important parameter in fluid machinery but it has seldom {{been used in the}} diffuser design of <b>single-stage</b> centrifugal <b>pumps.</b> To improve the design method of radial diffuser use in centrifugal pumps, the diffusion coefficient was introduced into the design of radial diffusers based on a single-arc hydraulic design method and {{it was found that the}} vane outlet angle, vane outlet thickness and vane number have a significant impact on the design results. A <b>single-stage</b> centrifugal <b>pump</b> with a radial diffuser was selected as the research model.

The results indicate that the head and efficiency of the pump are best when the vane outlet angle is 6 °. The flow area decreases and the flow velocity at radial diffuser outlet increase when the outlet thickness is greater than 2 mm. The hydraulic loss is minimum and the head and efficiency are better when the vane number is 8 at different flow rates. So, the optimal range of the diffusion coefficient for the model pump is around 1. 6 to 2.

There are many studies proving the better performance of cascade heat <b>pumps</b> compared to <b>single-stage</b> heat <b>pumps</b> when the difference between the condensing and the evaporation temperature is large. In this system approach study, different GSHP arrangements are described and computationally compared. A two-stage heat pump arrangement is introduced in which water tanks of the heating system are utilized for warming up the DHW in two stages. It is shown that the electricity consumption with this two-stage system is approximately 31 % less than with the <b>single-stage</b> heat <b>pump</b> and 12 % less than with the cascade system. Further, both low temperature (LT) and HT heat pumps can run alone, which is not common in cascade or other two-stage heat pumps. This is advantageous because the high loads of the space heating and DHW production are not simultaneous. Proper insulation of the DHW and recirculation pipe network is essential, and drying towel rails or other heating coils should be avoided when aiming for a high efficiency.

The heat for driving the second-stage bubble pump is provided by refrigerant steam produced from the first-stage bubble pump. The experiment data shows that the heating of refrigerant vapor {{is only one of}} the elements of pump-up phenomenon. Another is that the intermediate solution flashes to vapor to become bubbles. The pump-up phenomenon of double-stage bubble pump has much to do with the pressure difference of intermediate solution and first-stage refrigerant vapor.
