A nano-slit is characterized as a sensor for coherent line-and-space features. Experiments and simulation verify image detection with contrasts greater than 0. 9. Effects of polarization on imaging performance are reported. A scanning and rotating nano-slit in conjunction with a filtered back-projection technique is used to reconstruct sub-micron coherent spot distributions. Simulation results show very good agreement with the experiment. Further, it is shown that the reconstruction is very resilient to some common random experimental errors. Imaging {{characteristics of}} a scanning nano-slit sensor are determined for high NA partially coherent images.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Sub-micron</b> <b>feature</b> sizes have {{resulted}} in a considerable portion of power to be dissipated on the buses, causing an increased attention on savings for power at the behavioral level and RT level of design. This paper ad-dresses the problem of minimizing power dissipated in switching of the buses in data path synthesis. Unlike the previous approaches in which minimization of the power consumed in buses has not been considered until operation scheduling is completed, our approach integrates the bus binding problem into scheduling to exploit the impact of scheduling on reduction of power dissipated on the buses more fully and effectively. We accomplish this by formu-lating the problem into a flow problem in a network, and devising an efficient algorithm which iteratively finds maxi-mum flow of minimum cost solutions in the network. Exper-imental results on a number of benchmark problems show that given resource and global timing constraints our de-signs are 22 % power-efficient over the designs produced by a random-move based solution, and 18 % power-efficient over the designs by a clock-step based optimal solution. ...|$|E
40|$|Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) {{microscopy}} has excellent {{magnetic field}} sensitivity, but suffers from modest spatial resolution {{when compared with}} other scanning probes. This spatial resolution is determined by both {{the size of the}} field sensitive area and the spacing between this area and the sample surface. In this paper we describe scanning SQUID susceptometers that achieve sub-micron spatial resolution while retaining a white noise floor flux sensitivity of ≈ 2 μΦ_ 0 /Hz^ 1 / 2. This high spatial resolution is accomplished by deep <b>sub-micron</b> <b>feature</b> sizes, well shielded pickup loops fabricated using a planarized process, and a deep etch step that minimizes the spacing between the sample surface and the SQUID pickup loop. We describe the design, modeling, fabrication, and testing of these sensors. Although sub-micron spatial resolution has been achieved previously in scanning SQUID sensors, our sensors not only achieve high spatial resolution, but also have integrated modulation coils for flux feedback, integrated field coils for susceptibility measurements, and batch processing. They are therefore a generally applicable tool for imaging sample magnetization, currents, and susceptibilities with higher spatial resolution than previous susceptometers. Comment: 13 figure...|$|E

Unlike other techniques such as electron beam lithography or focussed ion beam processing, DMD-based laser processing allows image field sizes of ~ 30 µm 2 to be processed using a single femtosecond laser pulse. When combined with step-and-repeat techniques, at laser repetition rates of 1 kHz and single pulse energies of ~ 1 mJ, final patterned areas of around 1 cm 2 with sub-micron resolution could be achieved within reasonable (less than 1 hour) time scales. We have used DMD-based highly demagnified image projection for ablation, multiphoton polymerisation and laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT). Using 800 nm femtosecond laser pulses, we have so far produced features by ablation with linewidths of ~ 400 nm in 300 nm thick films, and achieved <b>sub-micron</b> <b>feature</b> sizes in 10 µm thick photoresist via multiphoton processing. For LIFT, we have successfully printed solid-phase materials with few µm feature sizes, and are currently investigating the final aspect ratio (width-to-thickness of printed deposits) that is achievable without causing undesirable shattering or damage. We are also evaluating the role of single pulse versus multipulse exposure for ablation and polymerisation. For all three techniques, we are evaluating the ultimate resolution and feature sizes achievable, and also (for LIFT) the possibility of stacking deposits to form complex 3 -dimensional structures of few µm dimensions.

40|$|The {{progress}} of VLSI technology towards deep <b>sub-micron</b> <b>feature</b> sizes, e. g., sub- 100 nanometer technology, {{has created a}} growing impact of hardware defects and fabrication process variability, which lead to reductions in yield rate. To address these problems, a new approach, system-level error tolerance (ET), has been recently introduced. Considering that {{a significant percentage of}} the entire chip production is discarded due to minor imperfections, this approach is based on accepting imperfect chips that introduce imperceptible/acceptable system-level degradation; this leads to increases in overall effective yield. In this paper, we investigate the impact of hardware faults on the video compression performance, with a focus on the motion estimation (ME) process. More specifically, we provide an analytical formulation of the impact of single and multiple stuck-at-faults within ME computation. We further present a model for estimating the system-level performance degradation due to such faults, which can be used for the error tolerance based decision strategy of accepting a given faulty chip. We also show how different faults and ME search algorithms compare in terms of error tolerance and define the characteristics of search algorithm that lead to increased error tolerance. Finally, we show that different hardware architectures performing the same metric computation have different error tolerance characteristics and we present the optimal ME hardware architecture in terms of error tolerance. While we focus on ME hardware, our work could also applied to systems (e. g., classifiers, matching pursuits, vector quantization) where a selection is made among several alternatives (e. g., class label, basis function, quantization codeword) based on which choice minimizes an additive metric of interest...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} work {{undertaken to}} understand the physics of dry-etching AlGaInP/GaAs laser structures in Cl-based plasmas to develop a process that allows the fabrication of high-aspect-ratio, <b>sub-micron</b> <b>features.</b> The effects of the main process parameters on the etch rate, selectivity and post-etch surface roughness were studied {{to understand how the}} interactions between the semiconductor materials and the plasma gives rise to different sidewall geometries. The behaviour of the two types of material {{in the presence of a}} Cl-based plasma was found to be very different due to the production of InCb when etching the AlGaInP layers which is absent when etching GaAs. This product is involatile and rate limiting in Cl-rich plasmas. Effective removal of the inhibiting InCb was shown to be necessary to selectively etch the AlGaInP layers anisotropically at a reasonably high etching rate. A narrow range of plasma conditions satisfied these requirements. These conditions provided the thermal- and ion-assisted desorption of the InCh such that the removal rate matches the formation rate. In contrast, GaAs was shown to etch anisotropically under a much wider range of conditions as the mechanism for anisotropic etching does not require an inhibitor. With an optimized set of etch parameters, etching of high-aspect-ratio, <b>sub-micron</b> <b>features</b> in AlGaInP/GaAs laser structures was demonstrated. Despite the difference in etch mechanisms of GaAs and AlGaInP and the use of a 2 -step process, at the same Ar fraction vertical sidewall features were achieved in both materials when etching sub-micron gratings. Under conditions that provide smooth vertical sidewalls the etch rate was shown to be aspect-ratio dependent due to the depletion of neutral species at the base of the feature. A range of 1 -D gratings were etched with lattice constants as short as 200 nm and aspect ratios as high as 20 : 1. To the best of my knowledge these are the deepest vertically etched structures on this scale in AlGaInP/GaAs.

The goal of this thesis was to utilize an Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique to fabricate periodic metamaterial structures. Multi-Photon Polymerization (MPP) is a powerful AM method that has the capability to manufactures complex micro-scale 3 D structures using ultra-short laser pulses. Typically, MPP {{has been used to}} manufacture micron-scale components in photopolymer materials. However, the development of sub-micron scale processes that can produce components from multiple materials within a single manufacturing step would be advantageous and open the potential to include different materials that can be manipulated and embedded within structures with <b>sub-micron</b> <b>feature</b> sizes. A combined MPP and Optical Trapping (OT) setup was proposed to achieve the capability of fabricating periodic sub-micron structures with multiple materials. Firstly, a modular MPP system was designed, assemble and tested. Secondly, a bespoke OT setup was assembled and tested with a variety of particles. Thirdly, the single material system was combined with an optical trapping (OT) setup to independently manipulate microparticles in the x, y and z planes. An afocal lens arrangement was employed to reduce the gap produced by aberrations in the system.

Failure {{to meet these}} criteria may result in extremely costly loss of production or failure of experiments. For such facilities floors are massive but stiff, generally have first mode natural frequencies above 10 Hz and are typically classed as ‘high frequency floors’. The process of design to limit in-service vibrations to within specific or generic vibration criteria is termed ‘vibration control’. Several guidance documents for vibration control of high frequency floors have been published, for different applications. These design guides typically propose simplifications of complex floor systems and use of empirical predictive design formulae. A recently published guide uses a more rigorous approach based on first-principle modal analysis and modeling footfalls as effective impulses, but there remain unresolved issues about its application, and this paper addresses these {{in order to develop}} an improved methodology. First, the significant but conventionally discounted contribution of resonance well above the conventionally accepted boundary between low and high frequency floors is examined. The level of necessary modeling detail is then considered along with the effect of accounting for adjacent bays in simulation of a regular multi-bay floors. Finally, while it is assumed that contributions of higher modes to impulsive response decrease so that a cut-off frequency can be prescribed, simulations demonstrate that with both effective impulse and real footfall forces, there is not necessarily asymptotic response with rising floor mode frequency. The conclusion is that there are no shortcuts to predicting response of high frequency floors to footfall excitation.

Currently, there is no proven visually beneficial treatment for these types of disease; however, stem cell-based therapy is a recent strategy which has the potential to preserve and restore vision in these conditions. In addition to replacing lost or diseased cells, transplanted cells may be able to rescue dying photoreceptors of the host retina. While studies have shown that retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) delivered by bolus injection can differentiate into retinal specific neurons after subretinal transplantation, they {{have not been able to}} maintain morphologic development, lamination, or extensive integration with the host retina. Therefore, a mechanism is needed to confer organization and instructional cues to these grafted cells. In this research, micro and nano-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS) processing techniques were used to create biodegradable thin-film scaffolds to guide the differentiation and organization of stem cells for retinal tissue engineering. Through standard MEMS processes, including photolithography and reactive ion etching, a high throughput array of <b>sub-micron</b> <b>features</b> (500 nm to 1 pm) was fabricated into silicon wafers. A novel templating process was developed to then imprint these structures into biodegradable polycaprolactone (PCL) thin films (5 - 10 pm) with minimal deformation to the imprinted features. PCL was chosen due to its low melt temperature, adaptability to microfabrication processing, as well as its mechanical and bioresorptive properties. Furthermore, PCL thin films have been shown to be well tolerated long term when transplanted in the subretinal space of mice. RPCs were cultured on PCL thin films, and cell responses to sub-micron topography of varying dimension and geometry were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry. <b>Sub-micron</b> <b>features</b> were found to definitively affect cell behavior. For example, while RPCs cultured on post structures demonstrated an early upregulation of differentiation markers, including rhodopsin and recoverin, RPCs cultured on a ridge-groove topography developed substantial elongation and parallel alignment in addition to upregulation. This unique structured PCL thin-film platform therefore provides a means to organize and differentiate RPCs in a controlled manner and offers potential as a clinical treatment for retinal degenerative diseases. by Chi Wan Ko.

The characteristic dimension of the physical lithography systems which are simulated is on the order of 100 nm. At such size-scale, surface-tension-effects are predominant, and as a consequence, our simulations demonstrate that nanometer-sized structures with great application potentials can be fabricated. Specifically, this study demonstrates that surfaces with three-dimensional nanoscale structures can be fabricated from templates with micron or <b>sub-micron</b> <b>features</b> through the development of cusps in the corners of the polygonal capillaries. Quantitatively, the effects of contact angle, corner angle, meniscus confinement, and corner rounding radius are examined and scaling analyses are presented to describe the dependencies of the height variation across the meniscus on these parameters. These simulations serve as useful guides for extending the development and implementation of capillary force lithography. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Scanning {{electrooptic}} microscopy provides optical imaging {{of surface}} ferroelectric polarization patterns by measuring modulation of the output optical signal induced by a sinusoidal electric field. Ferroelectric single crystals and inhomogeneous phase transitions in ferroelectric thin films were investigated by this technique. Here we report {{investigation of the}} domain structure in relaxor materials. We have observed formation and evolution of microscopic domains under the action of a dc bias electric field. Furthermore, the local electrooptic switching loops have been measured with <b>sub-micron</b> resolution. <b>Features</b> of electrooptic imaging in ceramic samples are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} initial {{steps at}} fabricating a dielectric photonic bandgap accelerator structure designed {{to operate at}} near IR frequencies. Such a structure operating at these frequencies requires extremely small, <b>sub-micron</b> sized <b>features,</b> forcing one to use lithographic means for fabrication. A process based upon lithographic equipment at the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility has been developed and a four layer test structure has been fabricated. Unexpected problems with the final etch step, and corresponding modifications to the process flow addressing these problems, are described. Spectroscopic measurements of the structure have been taken and are compared to simulations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As {{semiconductor}} technology strides towards billions of transistors {{on a single}} die, problems concerned with deep <b>sub-micron</b> process <b>features</b> and design productivity call for new approaches {{in the area of}} behavioural models. This paper focuses on some of recent developments and new opportunities for Petri nets in designing asynchronous circuits such as synthesis of asynchronous control circuits from large Petri nets generated from front-end specifications in hardware description languages. These new methods avoid using full reachability state space for logic synthesis. They include direct mapping of Petri nets to circuits, structural methods with linear programming, and synthesis from unfolding prefixes using SAT solvers...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} lithography-free {{fabrication of}} <b>sub-micron</b> surface <b>features</b> on quartz substrates by the {{reactive ion etching}} (RIE) in a CF 4 /Ar atmosphere. These submicron glass columns are well defined, have a high aspect ratio, with the underlying substrate being very flat. The geometry of the fabricated surface columns {{is dependent on the}} RIE process parameters. The analysis of these glass columns shows that a differential etching process takes place. The optical characterization of these samples shows a significant absorption at visible wavelengths whereas the relative transmission is very high in the infrared range, suggesting that these samples could potentially be used for wavelength selection device applications...|$|R
40|$|Background: Controlled {{restriction}} of cellular movement using microfluidics {{allows one to}} study individual cells to gain insight into aspects of their physiology and behaviour. For example, the use of micron-sized growth channels that confine individual Escherichia coli has yielded novel insights into cell growth and death. To extend this approach to other species of bacteria, {{many of whom have}} dimensions in the sub-micron range, or to a larger range of growth conditions, a readily-fabricated device containing <b>sub-micron</b> <b>features</b> is required. Results: Here we detail the fabrication of a versatile device with growth channels whose widths range from 0. 3 ?m to 0. 8 ?m. The device is fabricated using electron beam lithography, which provides excellent control over the shape and size of different growth channels and facilitates the rapid-prototyping of new designs. Features are successfully transferred first into silicon, and subsequently into the polydimethylsiloxane that forms the basis of the working microfluidic device. We demonstrate that the growth of sub-micron scale bacteria such as Lactococcus lactis or Escherichia coli cultured in minimal medium can be followed in such a device over several generations. Conclusions: We have presented a detailed protocol based on electron beam fabrication together with specific dry etching procedures for the fabrication of a microfluidic device suited to study submicron-sized bacteria. We have demonstrated that both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria can be successfully loaded and imaged over a number of generations in this device. Similar devices could potentially be used to study other submicron-sized organisms under conditions in which the height and shape of the growth channels are crucial to the experimental design.
