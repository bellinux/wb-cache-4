60|$|Bathsheba {{never forgot}} that {{transient}} little picture of Liddy crossing the swamp to her {{there in the}} morning light. Iridescent bubbles of dank subterranean breath rose from the sweating sod beside the waiting-maid's feet as <b>she</b> trod, <b>hissing</b> as they burst and expanded away to join the vapoury firmament above. Liddy did not sink, as Bathsheba had anticipated.|$|R
6000|$|... "You fool!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>hissed</b> at him, {{and half}} raised her whip to strike, but checked on the impulse, be{{thinking}} her in time that, after all, what the poor lad had done {{he had done}} thinking her distressed.|$|E

60|$|As <b>she</b> spoke {{something}} <b>hissed</b> {{through the}} air just above her head, and stuck fast in the bark of a sapling. Noie sprang forward and plucked it out. It was a little reed, feathered with grasses, and having a sharp ivory point, smeared with some green substance.|$|R
6000|$|... "There isn't a good one," [...] <b>she</b> <b>hissed.</b> [...] "There was badness {{enough in}} the captain taking all that money, but I don't think there was much {{goodness}} in the prince giving it. The captain's {{not the only one}} with something against him." ...|$|E

50|$|In the Age of X reality, Jessica Drew is {{a member}} of the Avengers, mutant hunters who answer to General Frank Castle. Going by the codename Redback, Jessica is one of America's top killers and has been for eight years.

50|$|Yorga reunites Donna {{with her}} mother. Michael finds Paul's {{mutilated}} body while navigating the crypt. Brudah attacks him, but Michael stabs him, presumably to death.

Just as he does, Erica, now a vampire and completely under Yorga's control, and an unnamed, red-headed vampire charge into the room. Michael fends them off, chasing away the red-head while Erica pauses, giving Michael a chance to stake her. Despite seeing {{she is no longer}} the Erica he knows, he can't bring himself to do so, and proceeds upstairs while <b>she</b> <b>hisses</b> at him. On the way to the staircase, Brudah emerges from the living room, holding his profusely bleeding knife wound, intent on attacking Michael. Michael, somewhat stunned that Brudah is still alive, moves up the staircase as Brudah reaches out for him. Brudah then collapses, finally dying. Upstairs, Michael confronts Yorga and Donna's mother. Yorga pushes Donna's mother into Michael's stake and flees. Michael follows, and Yorga ambushes him outside the room. Michael rams the charging Yorga with his stake, killing him. Donna mourns her mother a second time before Michael collects her. He and Donna watch Yorga turn to dust.|$|R

She toured the States for many years, but her {{performance}} was often too ‘strong’ for the audience. <b>She</b> was <b>hissed</b> of the stage in Kansas City, for example. [...] "The people think I'm — ah — what you say? Naught-ee?," [...] she commented. [...] "Ah. monsieur, they don't understand. They will learn. Ah, these Americans, they are just a little slow, but they all like 'the great Fougere' when they know her. But, o-o-ooh ! I'm all breathless, c'est terrible!" ...|$|R

Annie brings drinks and bananas for Esther, tossing the food into the well, but there's still no response from Esther.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly she {{uttered a}} shrill shriek, for <b>she</b> heard a <b>hissing</b> whisper at {{her ear and}} felt an icy breath upon her cheek. She dared not turn round, for {{she saw that the}} door opening upon the churchyard {{remained}} closed as before, and that occasionally passing within the range of her fixed stare, a white hare with blood-red eyes gambolled round the belfry.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} trial, Hede Massing, an Austrian-born confessed Soviet spy {{who was being}} {{threatened}} with deportation, and whom the first judge had not permitted to testify, provided some slight corroboration of Chambers's story. <b>She</b> recounted meeting <b>Hiss</b> {{at a party in}} 1935.

6000|$|... "You boor!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>hissed.</b> [...] "You base underbred clod! Is {{this your}} care and your hospitality? I would rather wed a branded serf from my father's fields.

60|$|Lady Baxby precipitately {{retreated to}} {{the door in the}} turret, closed it, locked it, and ascended one round of the staircase, where there was a loophole. 'I am not coming!

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>hissed</b> out {{the words}} with intense malignity, nearly {{screaming}} in the bitterness she felt towards the beautiful daughter of better education than herself, almost of different station. It was all but a triumph for her that this had happened. It brought her daughter down; she turned the tables, and now, from the superiority of her virtue, she looked down upon her with utter contempt.|$|E

6000|$|... "Be still, fool!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>hissed</b> in his ear. She had need to {{keep her}} wits about her, to think, to weigh each word that she might utter. An abyss had opened in her path; a false step, {{and she and her}} son were irrevocably lost--sent headlong to destruction. Rotherby, already reduced to the last stage of fear, was obedient as he had never been, and fell silent instantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do as I bid you," [...] <b>she</b> <b>hissed,</b> {{and they}} let the boat drift with the wind till {{it came to a}} little island within thirty yards of the {{anchored}} vessel, an island with a willow tree growing upon its shore.

60|$|They say that, when Mrs. Crawley was {{particularly}} {{down on her}} luck, she gave concerts and lessons in music here and there. There was a Madame de Raudon, who certainly had a matinee musicale at Wildbad, accompanied by Herr Spoff, premier pianist to the Hospodar of Wallachia, and my little friend Mr. Eaves, who knew everybody and had travelled everywhere, always used to declare {{that he was at}} Strasburg in the year 1830, when a certain Madame Rebecque made her appearance in the opera of the Dame Blanche, giving occasion to a furious row in the theatre there. <b>She</b> was <b>hissed</b> off the stage by the audience, partly from her own incompetency, but chiefly from the ill-advised sympathy of some persons in the parquet, (where the officers of the garrison had their admissions); and Eaves was certain that the unfortunate debutante in question was no other than Mrs. Rawdon Crawley.|$|R

"As when th' {{imperial}} eagle soars on high, [...] And bears some speckled serpent through the sky, [...] While her sharp talons gripe the bleeding prey, [...] In many a fold her curling volumes play, [...] Her starting brazen scales with horror rise, [...] The sanguine flames flash dreadful {{from her eyes}} [...] <b>She</b> writhes, and <b>hisses</b> at her foe, in vain, [...] Who wins at ease the wide ærial plain, [...] With her strong hooky beak the captive plies, [...] And bears the struggling prey triumphant through the skies." ...|$|R
