50|$|A <b>scrag</b> is {{a marine}} troll, a gilled {{form of the}} common troll. A <b>scrag</b> is found in {{a large body of}} water, as it needs {{considerable}} room to hunt. The coloration of a <b>scrag</b> runs from blue-green to olive, and its forelimbs are shorter and weaker than ordinary trolls. The freshwater <b>scrag</b> is smaller than a normal troll and has heavy scales and less formidable claws, but its enlarged lower jaw bears many small, very sharp fangs. The saltwater <b>scrag</b> is found in seas and oceans, and is at least as large as an ordinary troll. A saltwater <b>scrag</b> has thick and heavily scaled skin, {{and some of them are}} intelligent enough to further protect themselves with armor made of shells and sharkskin or similar substances. A saltwater <b>scrag's</b> forelimbs are shorter and weaker than those of an ordinary troll, but it has developed a huge maw and numerous fangs. A <b>scrag</b> regenerates as a troll does, but only when in immersed in water of its natural element.|$|R

50|$|The fifteen-yard {{penalty was}} first {{introduced}} at senior level by the Victorian Football Association in 1939, {{as one of the}} rules included in its rival code of Australian rules football. The rule was introduced to give the umpire a means of penalising a player who cribbed over the mark or wasted time on the mark; under standard rules at the time, such infractions could only be policed by reports. The Australian National Football Council introduced the rule into the national rules during 1954 (leagues began using it in 1955), which was applied to both time-wasting and to crude, late challenges on the player with the mark. The length was increased to 50 metres in 1988 when it was determined that the fifteen metre penalty had become insufficient to deter time-wasting and <b>scragging.</b>|$|E

40|$|Property {{modification}} {{factors have}} been introduced into the AASHTO Guide Specification for Seismic Isolation Design to account for likely variations in isolation bearing properties {{over the life of}} a seismically isolated bridge. The design of an isolated bridge in the United States must now account for variations in temperature, ageing, velocity (strain rate), travel, contamination, and <b>scragging.</b> In the absence of elastomer compound test data, the Guide Specification provides de facto values for likely variations in temperature, ageing, and <b>scragging</b> for use in design. Experimental data from tests of high-damping and lead-rubber bearings were analyzed to assess the de facto values listed in the Specification. The AASHTO values for the <b>scragging</b> factor should be increased from 1. 2 to between 1. 5 and 2. 0 for HDR-A elastomeric bearings and left unchanged for lead-rubber bearings. Full recovery of virgin (unscragged) properties following <b>scragging</b> should be assumed. No change in the AASHTO ageing factors for high-damping and lead-rubber bearings are recommended at this time. The data support the listing of a velocity (strain rate) factor in the Guide Specification with a value equal to 1. 2 for high-damping elastomer compounds...|$|E

40|$|High damping rubber (HDR) shows a quite complex {{constitutive}} behaviour, {{which is}} nonlinear {{with respect to}} strain and {{is dependent on the}} strain rate. In addition, it exhibits a transient response during which the material properties change (<b>scragging</b> or more generally the Mullins effect). A number of recent works were dedicated to analysing and modelling material behaviour. This paper studies the nonlinear dynamics of systems with restoring force produced by HDR-based devices in order to propose a procedure to define equivalent linear models considering both transient and stationary behaviours. The reliability of these linear models is tested by evaluating the upper and lower bounds of the seismic response of a structural system equipped with HDR-based devices (structural system with dissipative bracings and isolated systems) ...|$|E

40|$|Although the {{magnitudes}} of inelastic and viscoelastic {{effects in}} filled rubbers are small relative {{to that of}} the elastic response, these effects are nevertheless critical in applications such as gaskets, seals and dampers. This study investigates the role of deformation history on relaxation of rubber through time-dependent experiments following a range of deformation histories. Two grades of carbon-black filled EPDM were subjected to uniaxial tensile deformation followed by stress-relaxation or stress memory at fixed deformation. Stress relaxation was found to be highly dependent on strain levels following a single loading. When an additional load-unload cycle was added to the history, the rubbers relaxed an approximately constant fraction of stress after a given time, provided that the strain at stress relaxation was smaller than the historical maximum. This fraction was independent of both the applied strain and of the maximum strain, and suggests that the relaxation process is independent of <b>scragging</b> procedures used to control the modulus. Stress memory observed following load-unload cycles was also approximately independent of strain history...|$|E
40|$|This work employs five {{commercial}} carbon-black filled elastomers {{made from}} ethylene-propylene-diene, nitrile, butyl and natural rubber compounds to study different {{manifestations of the}} stress-softening phenomenon known as the Mullins effect. The structure of the materials was characterised using density, hardness, thermal analysis and microscopy. Cyclic tensile deformations under uniaxial, constant-width and equibiaxial models were used to study the mechanical response following different strain histories. The mechanical response and the energies stored and dissipated were both dependent on the strain history. Elastomers with no strain history exhibited a relatively constant dissipated energy fraction, which reduced to a lower constant fraction when the historical maximum strain was higher than the current maximum strain. A physically based modelling approach with a simple representation {{of the evolution of}} bound rubber was proposed to account for this. The approach was able to qualitatively reproduce the energy maps observed in the experimental data. A set of time-dependent test protocols were developed in both uniaxial and biaxial modes of deformation to investigate the effect of strain history on stress-relaxation and stress-memory following cyclic loading. All filled rubbers relaxed an approximately constant fraction of the stress after a given time when the applied strain during stress relaxation was smaller than the historical maximum. Under these circumstances the relaxed fraction was independent of both the strain history and the current strain, with important implications for <b>scragging.</b> An empirical function involving just five parameters was proposed to predict the fraction of unrelaxed stress for an arbitrary strain history. Stress memory was observed following unloading, with a recovered stress magnitude approximately independent of history. Anisotropy was investigated through linear dimensional swelling measurements. A degree of anisotropy was observed specific to the manufacturing process: compression moulding led to transverse isotropy, while sheet-rolling led to full anisotropy. Following a strain history, the anisotropy was shown to evolve further...|$|E
