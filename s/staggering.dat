40|$|The {{competition}} between the <b>staggered</b> flux state, or the d-density wave state, and the d-wave pairing state is analyzed in two-dimensional t-J model based on the U(1) slave boson mean-field theory. Not only <b>staggered</b> flux of spinon but also <b>staggered</b> flux of holon are considered. In this formalism, the hopping order parameter of physical electron is described by the product of hopping order parameters of spinon and holon. The <b>staggered</b> flux amplitude of electron is the difference of <b>staggered</b> flux amplitude of spinon and that of holon. In π-flux phase of spinon, <b>staggered</b> fluxes of spinon and holon cancel completely and <b>staggered</b> flux order of electron does not exist. However, in <b>staggered</b> flux phase of spinon whose <b>staggered</b> flux amplitude is not π, fluxes does not cancel completely and <b>staggered</b> flux amplitude of electron remains. Thus, the phase transition between these two phases, π-flux phase and <b>staggered</b> flux phase of spinon, becomes a second order transition in physical electron picture. The order parameter which characterizes this transition is <b>staggered</b> flux order parameter of electron. A mean-field phase diagram is shown. It is proved analytically {{that there is no}} coexisistence of <b>staggered</b> flux and d-wave pairing. The temperature dependences of Fermi surface and excitation gap at (0,π) are shown.

With the escape of the US X Corps and the ROK I Corps, Mao's vision for Chosin was not realized, and the failure caused Song Shi-Lun to offer his resignation.
