500|$|Former {{executives}} at Sega have mixed {{opinions of the}} 32X. [...] Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves {{as a warning to}} the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the Kinect and PlayStation Move for doing so. [...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. [...] An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to <b>stick</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn’t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons. In hindsight, it was not a great idea for a whole bunch of other reasons." ...|$|E

[...] Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush felt {{the first seven}} episodes of the season seemed [...] "to have learned the best of both" [...] from season one and Jessica Jones, [...] "placing its most compelling imagery front and center straightaway, but still taking time to pick apart the characters beneath them, rather than shout platitudes about saving the city." [...] He also praised the castings of Bernthal and Yung as Punisher and Elektra, respectively, and enjoyed [...] "the improved spotlight" [...] for Foggy and Karen, given the reduction of Dawson saying, [...] "So many superhero series struggle to draw its supporting characters as compellingly as the action, and Daredevils particular blend of set piece and legal thriller feels inescapably original." [...] However, Fitzpatrick did note the series lacked the presence Vondie Curtis-Hall brought as Ben Urich in the first season. He concluded that the season's progression [...] "feels much cleaner" [...] than the first's, [...] "moving almost in acts more than back and forth victories...Even the aim feels that much more cohesive, to start in a place of Matt, Foggy and Karen all confident in their new roles, but wrestling with the consequence of their choice to always help the helpless." [...] Merrill Barr of Forbes said, [...] "Daredevil season two is very much the same excellent show Daredevil season one was...but in the places it isn’t, it’s also very much improved". Barr praised Bernthal as the Punisher, and noted the reduction in the amount of [...] "thick blacks" [...] in the cinematography that the first season was criticized for.|$|E
