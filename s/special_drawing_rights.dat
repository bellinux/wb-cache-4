5|$|As part of {{the first}} {{amendment}} to its articles of agreement in 1969, the IMF developed a new reserve instrument called <b>special</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> (SDRs), which could be held by central banks and exchanged among themselves and the Fund as an alternative to gold. SDRs entered service in 1970 originally as units of a market basket of sixteen major vehicle currencies of countries whose share of total world exports exceeded 1%. The basket's composition changed over time and presently consists of the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and British pound. Beyond holding them as reserves, nations can denominate transactions among themselves and the Fund in SDRs, although the instrument is not a vehicle for trade. In international transactions, the currency basket's portfolio characteristic affords greater stability against the uncertainties inherent with free floating exchange rates. <b>Special</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> were originally equivalent to a specified amount of gold, but were not directly redeemable for gold and instead served as a surrogate in obtaining other currencies that could be exchanged for gold. The Fund initially issued 9.5 billion XDR from 1970 to 1972.|$|E
5|$|For example, in March 2009, as {{a result}} of the late-2000s {{financial}} crisis, the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation pressed for urgent consideration of a new international reserve currency and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development proposed greatly expanding the I.M.F.'s <b>special</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>rights.</b> Conspiracy theorists fear these proposals are a call for the U.S. to adopt a single global currency for a New World Order.|$|E
5|$|In the March 2009 speech {{entitled}} Reform the International Monetary System, Zhou Xiaochuan, {{the governor}} of the People's Bank of China, came out in favour of Keynes's idea of a centrally managed global reserve currency.

Zhou proposed a gradual move towards increased use of IMF <b>special</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> (SDRs).|$|E

25|$|Voting {{power in}} the IMF {{is based on a}} quota system. Each member has a number of basic votes (each member's number of basic votes equals 5.502% of the total votes), plus one {{additional}} vote for each <b>Special</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Right</b> (SDR) of 100,000 of a member country's quota. The <b>Special</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Right</b> is the unit of account of the IMF and represents a claim to currency. It is based on a basket of key international currencies. The basic votes generate a slight bias in favour of small countries, but the additional votes determined by SDR outweigh this bias. Changes in the voting shares require approval by a supermajority of 85% of voting power.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Special</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Right</b> (SDR) is an {{international}} reserve asset, created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1969 to supplement its member countries’official reserves.

Since creation, in Bretton Woods, of the International Monetary Fund, two important amendments {{have been brought}} to the statutes of this institution. First, in July 1969, a <b>Special</b> <b>Drawing</b> mechanism was created; second, following the April 1978 amendment, the <b>Special</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Right</b> system is no longer based on gold.

40|$|ABSTRACT In the late- 1960 ’s, {{international}} discussions over {{a possible}} {{reform of the}} international monetary system originated the <b>Special</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Right</b> (SDR). While they had been created initially to represent an additional asset to complement the existing reserves of U. S. dollars and gold, after the crisis of the Bretton Woods system the SDR was considered a possible substitute of the U. S. dollar. Relying on a consolidated literature, this article aims at demonstrating that the origins of the SDR were not the exclusive result of technical financial negotiations, but of the convergence of higher political interests against the United States and the dollar dominance...|$|R
25|$|IMF {{policies}} have been repeatedly criticised for {{making it difficult for}} indebted countries to say no to environmentally harmful projects that nevertheless generate revenues such as oil, coal, and forest-destroying lumber and agriculture projects. Ecuador for example had to defy IMF advice repeatedly to pursue the protection of its rainforests, though paradoxically this need was cited in IMF argument to support that country. The IMF acknowledged this paradox in the 2010 report that proposed the IMF Green Fund, a mechanism to issue <b>special</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> directly to pay for climate harm prevention and potentially other ecological protection as pursued generally by other environmental finance.|$|E
25|$|The <b>special</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> (SDR) {{valuation}} is an IMF {{basket of}} currencies, including the Japanese yen. The SDR {{is linked to}} a basket of currencies with 41.9% for the U.S. dollar, 37.4% for the euro, 11.3% for the pound sterling, and 9.4% for the yen (as of 2011). The percentage for the yen has, however, declined from 18% in 2000. The exchange rate for the Japanese yen is {{expressed in terms of}} currency units per U.S. dollar; other rates are expressed as U.S. dollars per currency unit. The SDR currency value is calculated daily and the valuation basket is reviewed and adjusted every five years. The SDR was created in 1969, to support the fixed exchange system.|$|E
25|$|By 1968, {{the attempt}} to defend the dollar at a fixed peg of $35/ounce, {{the policy of the}} Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson administrations, had become {{increasingly}} untenable. Gold outflows from the U.S. accelerated, and despite gaining assurances from Germany and other nations to hold gold, the unbalanced fiscal spending of the Johnson administration had transformed the dollar shortage of the 1940s and 1950s into a dollar glut by the 1960s. In 1967, the IMF agreed in Rio de Janeiro to replace the tranche division set up in 1946. <b>Special</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> (SDRs) were set as equal to one U.S. dollar, but were not usable for transactions other than between banks and the IMF. Nations were required to accept holding SDRs equal to three times their allotment, and interest would be charged, or credited, to each nation based on their SDR holding. The original interest rate was 1.5%.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} if policymakers seek to enhance global liquidity, then the {{international}} community must provide a higher and better coordinated level of fiscal support than {{it has in the}} past. Loans to troubled sovereigns or financial institutions imply a credit risk that ultimately must be lodged somewhere. Expanded international lending facilities, including an expanded IMF, cannot remain unconditionally solvent absent an expanded level of fiscal backup. The same point obviously applies to the European framework for managing internal sovereign debt problems, including proposals for a jointly guaranteed eurozone sovereign bond. Even attainment of a significant role for the <b>Special</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Right</b> depends upon enhanced fiscal resources and burden sharing at the international level. ...|$|R
40|$|After {{several years}} of efforts, {{especially}} {{on the part of}} the Chinese government, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced on November 30, 2015 that the Chinese currency, yuan (RMB or人民币), will be included into the <b>Special</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Right</b> (SDR) basket, starting in October 2016. The SDR is an artificial currency created in 1969 to implement the U. S. dollar as an reserve asset. The SDR has been used as the unit of account in IMF. Currently, the SDR consists of four currencies: $, €, £, and ¥. These four currencies are also the major reserve currencies held by the central banks. Two questions arise: Is the RMB ready to be a major reserve currency? What are the benefits and costs of being a reserve currency...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the origin, evolution, and results of two initiatives {{taken by the}} United Kingdom in the early 1960 s. Both initiatives aimed at facilitating large-scale lending by the IMF (or in close parallel to the IMF), primarily {{in support of the}} two reserve currencies of the international monetary system, the US dollar and sterling. The first initiativeâ€”of which {{there appears to be no}} previous record extant anywhereâ€”achieved its objective, leading to three important changes in IMF policy, including the General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB). The design of the second practically ensured its failure to win international support; but it provoked the United States into proposing a powerful study group on international liquidity which, seven years later, resulted in the creation of the <b>Special</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Right</b> (SDR) facility in the IMF. ...|$|R
25|$|A renewed {{interest}} in Keynesian ideas {{was not limited to}} Western countries and stimulus plans were a common response to the crisis from nations across the globe. Stimulus packages in Asia were on a par with those in Europe and America. In a speech delivered in March 2009 entitled Reform the International Monetary System, Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China, revived Keynes's idea of a centrally managed global reserve currency. Dr Zhou argued that it was unfortunate that Keynes's bancor proposal was not accepted at Bretton Woods in the 1940s. He argued that national currencies were unsuitable for use as global reserve currencies {{as a result of the}} Triffin dilemma – the difficulty faced by reserve currency issuers in trying to simultaneously achieve their domestic monetary policy goals and meet other countries' demand for reserve currency. Zhou proposed a gradual move towards adopting IMF <b>special</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> (SDRs) as a centrally managed global reserve currency.|$|E
25|$|The Santiago Conference, 15 April 1972, was {{the third}} {{occasion}} on which the developing countries have confronted the rich {{with the need to}} use trade and aid measures more effectively to improve living standards in the developing world. Discussion centred on the international monetary system and specifically on the South's proposal that a higher proportion of new <b>special</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> (SDRs) should be allocated to LDCs as a form of aid (the so-called 'link'). In Santiago, substantial disagreements arose within the Group of 77 (G77) despite preconference meetings. There was disagreement over the SDR proposal and between those in the G77 who wanted fundamental changes such as a change in the voting allocations in the South's favour at the IMF and those (mainly the Latin American countries) who wanted much milder reforms. This internal dissent seriously weakened the group's negotiating position and led to a final agreed motion which recommended that the IMF should examine the link and that further research be conducted into general reforms. This avoided firm commitments to act on the 'link' or general reform, and the motion was passed by conference.|$|E

Other notable supporters include the Archbishop of Canterbury, Bill Gates and Michael Moore. David Harding, founder and CEO of one of London's biggest hedge funds has given qualified support for a European tax on financial transactions, breaking ranks with many of his peers fiercely opposed to such a measure. Speculator George Soros, put forward a different proposal, calling rich countries to donate their <b>special</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>rights</b> {{for the purpose of}} providing international assistance, without necessarily dismissing the Tobin tax idea. It has been widely reported that the Pope backs such a tax. However, the reality is that a commission of the Vatican of which the Pope is not a member merely said that such a tax would be worth reflecting on.|$|E

40|$|As part {{of discussions}} on {{reforming}} {{the international monetary}} system, there has been renewed interest in the <b>Special</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Right</b> (SDR). In April 2011, the finance ministers and central bankers of the G 20 decided {{to work on a}} “criteria-based path to broaden the composition of the SDR”. 1 In practice, this would lead to the inclusion of the Chinese currency in the SDR, alongside the dollar, the euro, the yen and the British pound. This project is motivated by two main objectives: first, to make the SDR more attractive as a store of value and unit of account; second, to strengthen international monetary cooperation. The main obstacle is that the Chinese currency is not "freely usable", in the terminology of the International Monetary Fund. Given the ongoing process of internationalization of the currency and flexibilization of the exchange-rate regime, relatively rapid inclusion of the renminbi in the SDR could bring substantial benefits in terms of representativeness, efficiency and stability.

40|$|Reform of the {{international}} monetary system is under discussion after three decades of apathy.

40|$|The global reserve {{system has}} {{returned}} {{to the top of the}} agenda in debates about international monetary reform. Much of the contemporary discussion draws on familiar issues but it has been given a new relevance in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008 / 09. One particular focus relates to the composition of international reserve assets and the role of the dollar. Will the dollar’s preeminent position be eroded and will the dollar be replaced by other international currencies? This paper examines the factors that determine a currency’s international status and assesses various candidate currencies including the euro and the Chinese renminbi. It also analyses the <b>Special</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Right</b> (SDR) as an international reserve asset. It concludes that, while there may be advantages in enhancing the SDR ’s role and endeavouring to implement the commitment made in the Second Amendment to the IMF’s Articles of Agreement to encourage it to become the world’s principal international reserve asset, the more likely outcome is that the dollar will retain its status as the main international currency, although it may be joined by other currencies in a multiple currency system. ...|$|R
