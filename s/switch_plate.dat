5000|$|In one instance, Cassagnes was {{performing}} a routine {{installation of a}} factory light <b>switch</b> <b>plate.</b> The plate was wrapped in a translucent decal covering. During the installation, Cassagnes removed the decal and wrote on it with a pencil. He quickly noticed that image transferred to the opposite face of the decal. Cassagnes tinkered with his discovery, {{which led to the}} world's first prototype of the Etch A Sketch. He called his invention L'Ecran Magique, which is translated as [...] "the Magic Screen." [...] The toy was first unveiled in 1959 at the [...] Nuremberg Toy Fair in Nuremberg, West Germany. Cassagnes later partnered with the American manufacturer Ohio Art Company to further develop the Etch a Sketch into its familiar form. The Ohio Art Company launched the Etch a Sketch in the United States during the 1960 holiday season. Cassagnes was also a well known kite designer and inventor in France. This was his main occupation but remained a hobby; he specialized in the creation of original modular kites throughout the 1980s. A 1992 article in Kite Lines magazine described him then as [...] "the most famous kitemaker in France." [...] He also invented several mechanical games: the Teleguide, which guides metal cars onto a track; and the SkeDoodle, a conceptual toy in which users draw images onto a globe-shaped screen.|$|E
40|$|SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is {{developing}} a next generation H-bridge <b>switch</b> <b>plate</b> [1], {{a critical component of}} the SNS High Voltage Converter Modulator [2]. As part of that effort, a new IGBT gate driver has been developed. The drivers {{are an integral part of}} the <b>switch</b> <b>plate,</b> which are essential to ensuring fault-tolerant, high-performance operation of the modulator. The redesigned driver improves upon the existing gate drive in several ways. The new gate driver has improved fault detection and suppression capabilities; suppression of shoot-through and over-voltage conditions, monitoring of dI/dt and Vce(sat) for fast over-current detection and suppression, and redundant power isolation are some of the added features. In addition, triggering insertion delay is reduced by a factor of four compared to the existing driver. This paper details the design and performance of the new IGBT gate driver. A simplified schematic and description of the construction are included. The operation of the fast over-current detection circuits, active IGBT over-voltage protection circuit, shoot-through prevention circuitry, and control power isolation breakdown detection circuit are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The 1 -MW High Voltage Converter Modulators [1] have {{operated}} {{in excess of}} 250, 000 hours at the Spallation Neutron Source.

An effort is underway at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory to redesign the modulator H-bridge <b>switch</b> <b>plate</b> {{with the goals of}} increasing reliability and performance [2]. The major difference between the SLAC design and the existing design is the use of press-pack IGBTs. Compared to other packaging options, these IGBTs have been shown to have increased performance in pulsed-power applications, have increased cooling capability, and do not fragment and disassemble during a fault event.

40|$|The RF source High Voltage Converter Modulator (HVCM) systems {{installed}} on the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) have operated well in excess of 200, 000 hours, during which time numerous failures have occurred.

The IGBTs are upgraded to 4500 V, 1200 A, press-pack devices, which increase the voltage margin, facilitate better cooling, and eliminate explosive disassembly of the package {{in the event of}} device failure. The upgrade to an advanced IGBT gate drive circuit decreases switching losses and improves fault-condition response. The upgrade design and development status will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{learning}} control algorithm is presented {{that reduces the}} closing time of a radio-frequency microelectromechanical systems switch by minimizing bounce while maintaining robustness to fabrication variability. The switch consists of a plate supported by folded-beam springs. Electrostatic actuation of the plate causes pull-in with high impact velocities, which are difficult to control due to parameter variations from part to part. A single degree-of-freedom model was utilized to design a simple {{learning control}} algorithm that shapes the actuation voltage based on the open/closed state of the switch. Experiments on three different test switches show that after 5 – 10 iterations, the learning algorithm lands the <b>switch</b> <b>plate</b> with an impact velocity not exceeding 0. 20 m/s, eliminating bounce. Simulations show that robustness to parameter variation {{is directly related to}} the number of required iterations for the device to learn the input for a bounce-free closure.

5000|$|The Nationality Room Program {{was founded}} by Ruth Crawford Mitchell {{at the request of}} Pitt Chancellor John Bowman in 1926 in order to involve the {{community}} {{as much as he could}} in constructing the Cathedral of Learning and to provide the spiritual and symbolic foundation of the Cathedral that what would make the inside of the building as inspiring and impressive as the outside. Under Mitchell's direction, invitations were extended to the nationality communities that made up the Pittsburgh area to provide a room that was representative of their heritage. Each group had to form a Room Committee, which would be responsible for all fundraising, designing, and acquisition. The University provided the room and upkeep in perpetuity once completed, while all other materials, labor, and design were provided by the individual committees. These were sometimes partly provided for by foreign governments which, [...] "...responded with generous support, often providing architects, artists, materials, and monetary gifts to assure authenticity and superb quality in their classrooms." [...] Each room's detail is carefully designed and executed down to the <b>switch</b> <b>plates,</b> door handles, hinges, and wastebaskets. The work is often performed and designed by native artists and craftsmen and involves imported artifacts and materials. Mitchell remained Director of the Nationality Rooms program until 1956, having overseen the creation of the first 19 rooms on the first floor of the Cathedral. A successor to Mitchell wasn't named until 1965, when current Director E. Maxine Bruhns took over the program, overseeing the completion (so far) of eight additional rooms on the third floor.|$|R
