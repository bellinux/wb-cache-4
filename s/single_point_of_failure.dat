The Chinese VLS has a lid for each launch cell, but {{uses the same}} cold launch mechanism for each cell. This eliminates the revolver system used in Russian VLS, and one <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> The Chinese claim this results in lower size, weight, and maintenance costs.|$|E
25|$|The central exchange, {{due to the}} system's design, {{is almost}} always a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> for local calls. As the {{capacity}} of individual switches and the optical fibre which interconnects them increases, potential disruption caused by destruction of one local office will only be magnified. Multiple fibre connections {{can be used to}} provide redundancy to voice and data connections between switching centres, but careful network design is required to avoid situations where a main fibre and its backup both go through the same damaged central office as a potential common mode failure.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{cases in which}} the use of a single {{computer}} would be possible in principle, but the use of a distributed system is beneficial for practical reasons. For example, it may be more cost-efficient to obtain the desired level of performance by using a cluster of several low-end computers, in comparison with a single high-end computer. A distributed system can provide more reliability than a non-distributed system, as there is no <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> Moreover, a distributed system may be easier to expand and manage than a monolithic uniprocessor system.|$|E

25|$|It {{was known}} that the filter room could be {{overwhelmed}} by a high volume of reports, {{and it was a}} constant complaint that it was a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> in reports from OR and in the RAF and Air Ministry. Most critics wanted the filter room to be moved from Bentley Priory to Group commands, lowering the reporting volume at each location and providing duplication. Dowding refused the change, leading to increasing friction with other commanders. Information overload occurred on several occasions and the filter room had to ask certain CH stations to stop reporting. But this had little effect on their capabilities. Later, stations reported information for multiple formations as a single plot.|$|E
25|$|The {{underwater}} environment {{presents a}} constant hazard of asphyxiation due to drowning. Breathing apparatus used for diving is life-support equipment, and failure can have fatal consequences - {{reliability of the}} equipment {{and the ability of}} the diver to deal with a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> are essential for diver safety. Failure of other items of diving equipment is generally not as immediately threatening, as provided the diver is conscious and breathing, there may be time to deal with the situation, however an uncontrollable gain or loss of buoyancy can put the diver at severe risk of decompression sickness, or of sinking to a depth where nitrogen narcosis or oxygen toxicity may render the diver incapable of managing the situation, which may lead to drowning while breathing gas remains available.|$|E
25|$|Some genetic {{diseases}} are named more precisely, and represent a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> on a metabolic pathway. For example, Tay-Sachs disease, GM2-gangliosidosis, AB variant, and Sandhoff disease might {{easily have been}} defined together as a single disease, because the three disorders are associated with failure of the same enzyme and have the same outcome. However, the three were discovered and named separately, and each represents a distinct molecular point of failure in a subunit that is required for activation of the enzyme. For all three disorders, compound heterozygosity is responsible for variant forms. For example, both TSD and Sandhoff disease have a more common infantile form and several late-onset variants. Post-infantile forms, which are rare, are generally caused by the inheritance of two unrelated alleles, of which one is usually a classic mutation, while {{the other is a}} rare or even novel one.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Shared disk cluster {{database}} management {{systems such as}} Oracle RAC are being discussed as a potential solution to the application scaling and robustness problem. This paper argues that the best solutions for availability have no <b>single</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> and support geo-clustering. RAC, with millions of lines of shared software between the DBMS and the disk that offer many <b>single</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure,</b> is less suitable as an availability solution and is better used as a multinode scale-out solution. This paper focuses on two important attributes of high-scale, data-intensive applications: 1) application availability and 2) affordable performance. The original design point for RAC was multinode scalability and it remains a less-than-ideal choice to address application availability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we propose a highly {{reliable}} wireless body area network (WBAN) that provides increased throughput and avoids <b>single</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> Such networks improve upon current WBANs by taking advantage of a new technology, Cooperative Network Coding (CNC). Using CNC in wireless body area network to support real-time applications is an attractive solution to combat packet loss, reduce latency due to retransmissions, avoid <b>single</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure,</b> and improve the probability of successful recovery of the information at the destination. In this paper, we have extended Cooperative Network Coding, from its original configuration (one-to-one) to many-to-many as in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Cooperative Network Coding results in increased throughput and network reliability because of the cooperation of the nodes in transmitting coded combination packets across spatially distinct paths to the information sinks.
