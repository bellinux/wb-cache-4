25|$|Robertson founded The Mechanics' Magazine in 1823, {{and edited}} and largely wrote {{it until the}} year of his death. It was a low-priced {{scientific}} weekly, and the first publication of its kind. To begin with he was in close alliance with Thomas Hodgskin: they had met in Edinburgh. It took advantage of a <b>stamp</b> <b>tax</b> exemption for technical weeklies not dealing in news. Robertson also devised a way of generating cheap content by an early crowdsourcing technique: {{letters to the editor}} were used without payment in continuing threads.|$|E

50|$|Historically, <b>stamp</b> <b>taxes</b> were {{administered}} by the Board of Stamps. This merged with the Board of Taxes in 1833/34, and the Board of Inland Revenue was created under the Inland Revenue Board Act 1849 by merger of the Board of Excise and Board of <b>Stamps</b> and <b>Taxes.</b> <b>Stamp</b> <b>taxes</b> were then {{administered by the}} Inland Revenue <b>Stamp</b> <b>Taxes</b> business stream (formerly the Stamp Office).

2500|$|The Glorious Revolution had {{established}} {{the principle of}} parliamentary supremacy. [...] Control of colonial trade and manufactures extended this principle across the ocean. This belief had never been tested {{on the issue of}} colonial taxation, but the British assumed that the interests of the thirteen colonies were so disparate that a joint colonial action was unlikely to occur against such a tax–an assumption that had its genesis in the failure of the Albany Conference in 1754. [...] By the end of December 1764, the first warnings of serious colonial opposition were provided by pamphlets and petitions from the colonies protesting both the Sugar Act and the proposed <b>stamp</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In London, the Rockingham {{government}} came {{to power}} (July 1765) and Parliament debated whether to repeal the <b>stamp</b> <b>tax</b> or to send an army to enforce it. Benjamin Franklin {{made the case for}} repeal, explaining that the colonies had spent heavily in manpower, money, and blood in defense of the empire in a series of wars against the French and Indians, and that further taxes to pay for those wars were unjust and might bring about a rebellion. Parliament agreed and repealed the tax (February 21, 1766), but insisted in the Declaratory Act of March 1766 that they retained full power to make laws for the colonies [...] "in all cases whatsoever". The repeal nonetheless caused widespread celebrations in the colonies.|$|E
2500|$|The Stamp Act {{was very}} unpopular among colonists. A {{consensus}} {{considered it a}} violation of their rights as Englishmen to be taxed without their consent—consent that only the colonial legislatures could grant. Their slogan was [...] "No taxation without representation." [...] Colonial assemblies sent petitions and protests. [...] The Stamp Act Congress held in New York City was the first significant joint colonial response to any British measure; it petitioned Parliament and the King. Local protest groups led by colonial merchants and landowners established connections through Committees of Correspondence, creating a loose coalition that extended from New England to Maryland. [...] Protests and demonstrations initiated by a new secret organization called the Sons of Liberty often turned violent and destructive as the masses became involved. [...] Very soon, all <b>stamp</b> <b>tax</b> distributors were intimidated into resigning their commissions, and the tax was never effectively collected.|$|E

2500|$|Stamp acts {{had been}} a very {{successful}} method of taxation within Great Britain; they generated over £100,000 in tax revenue with very little in collection expenses. [...] By requiring an official stamp on most legal documents, the system was almost self-regulating; a document would be null and void under British law without the required stamp. [...] Imposition of such a tax on the colonies had been considered twice before the Seven Years' War and once again in 1761. [...] Grenville had actually been presented with drafts of colonial stamp acts in September and October 1763, but the proposals lacked the specific knowledge of colonial affairs to adequately describe the documents subject to the stamp. At {{the time of the}} passage of the Sugar Act in April 1764, Grenville {{made it clear that the}} right to tax the colonies was not in question, and that additional taxes might follow, including a <b>stamp</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Stamp Act of 1765 (short title Duties in American Colonies Act 1765; 5 George III, c. 12) was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain that {{imposed a}} direct {{tax on the}} colonies of British America and {{required}} that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on stamped paper produced in London, carrying an embossed revenue stamp. Printed materials included legal documents, magazines, playing cards, newspapers, and many other types of paper used throughout the colonies. [...] Like previous taxes, the <b>stamp</b> <b>tax</b> had to be paid in valid British currency, not in colonial paper money. The purpose of the tax was {{to help pay for}} troops stationed in North America after the British victory in the Seven Years' War and its North American theater of the French and Indian War. The Americans said that there was no military need for the soldiers because there were no foreign enemies on the continent, and the Americans had always protected themselves against Indians. They suggested that it was actually a matter of British patronage to surplus British officers and career soldiers who should be paid by London.|$|E

60|$|The {{arrival of}} the fleet from England brought news of what had taken place since Captain Wilson's company had marched from Boston, a short time after the battle of Bunker's Hill. Immediately after the battle the colonists had sent two deputies, Penn and Lee, with a {{petition}} to Parliament {{for the restoration of}} peace. This petition was supported by a strong body in Parliament. The majority, however, argued that, from the conduct of the Americans, it was clear that they aimed at unconditional, unqualified, and total independence. In all their proceedings they had behaved as if entirely separated from Great Britain. Their professions and petition breathed peace and moderation; their actions and preparations denoted war and defiance; every attempt that could be made to soften their hostility had been in vain; their obstinacy was inflexible; and the more England had given in to their wishes, the more insolent and overbearing had their demands become. The <b>stamp</b> <b>tax</b> had been repealed, but their ill will had grown rather than abated. The taxations on imports had been entirely taken off save on one small item; but, rather than pay this, they had accumulated arms and ammunition, seized cannon belonging to the king, and everywhere prepared for armed resistance. Only two alternatives remained for the British nation to adopt--either to coerce the colonists to submission or to grant them their entire independence.|$|E
6000|$|Three {{months later}} he was, or {{believed}} himself to be, in the same mind. In a letter to Moore, dated April 9, 1814 (Letters, 1899, iii. 64), he writes, [...] "No more rhyme for--or rather, from--me. I have taken my leave of that stage, and henceforth will mountebank it no longer." [...] He had already--Journal, April 8 (Letters, 1898, ii. 408)--heard a rumour [...] "that his poor little pagod, Napoleon" [...] was [...] "pushed off his pedestal," [...] and before or after he began his letter to Moore he must have read an announcement in the Gazette Extraordinary (April 9, 1814--the abdication was signed April 11) that Napoleon had abdicated the [...] "throne of the world," [...] and declined upon the kingdom of Elba. On the next day, April 10, he wrote two notes to Murray, to inform {{him that he had}} written an [...] "ode on the fall of Napoleon," [...] that Murray could print it or not as he pleased; but that if it appeared by itself, it was to be published anonymously. A first edition consisting of fifteen stanzas, and numbering fourteen pages, was issued on the 16th of April, 1814. A second edition followed immediately, but as publications of less than a sheet were liable to the <b>stamp</b> <b>tax</b> on newspapers, at Murray's request, another stanza, the fifth, was inserted in a later (between the second and the twelfth) edition, and, by this means, the pamphlet was extended to seventeen pages. The concluding stanzas xvii., xviii., xix., which Moore gives in a note (Life, p. 249), were not printed in Byron's lifetime, but were first included, in a separate poem, in Murray's edition of 1831, and first appended to the Ode in the seventeen-volume edition of 1832.|$|E

50|$|A {{separate}} Board of Stamps {{was created}} by the Stamps Act 1694. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries at various points as financial strains on the economy demanded, and Parliament allowed, stamp duties were extended above a certain threshold of sale value to cover newspapers, pamphlets, lottery tickets, apprentices' indentures, advertisements, playing cards, dice, hats, gloves, patent medicines, perfumes, insurance policies, gold and silver plate and armorial bearings (coats of arms). One further category is the most widely cited example of an unpopular and most difficult to enforce tax, the Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795.
