40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine the {{relationships}} among various stepping parameters, sex, and age in the elderly. Healthy elderly Japanese individuals 60 - 85 years old (50 males and 61 females) performed 4 types of stepping motions for 20 s. Stepping motions included bilateral stepping (back/forth and right/left) and unilateral stepping (back/forth and right/left). The number of steps, the average connecting time of a foot during one step, and the average time of both feet touching the floor {{at the same time}} (bilateral connecting time) were measured with a foot <b>switch</b> <b>sheet.</b> The trial-to-trial reliability was very high (above 0. 86) except for the bilateral connecting time in the bilateral stepping back/forth test for 70 - 85 year olds (males: 0. 67, females: 0. 68). With age, the number of steps was significantly smaller, and the average connecting time and the bilateral connecting time were shorter in all stepping tests. There were significant sex differences in bilateral connecting time for bilateral stepping right and left and the number of steps for the bilateral stepping back and forth and the unilateral stepping right and left tests. The number of steps and average connecting time showed high correlations between bilateral stepping right/left and back/forth (r= 0. 71 - 0. 94) and between unilateral stepping back/forth and right/left (r= 0. 87 - 0. 99). There were significant correlations of the average connecting time between bilateral and unilateral stepping motions (r= 0. 51 - 0. 83), but both stepping motions are considered to have different motion properties from the viewpoint of center of gravity sway. The correlations between the bilateral connecting time and the number of steps in bilateral stepping were relatively low (males: |r|< 0. 70, females: |r|< 0. 57). The bilateral connecting time was near 0 s in many males; thus, it may depend greatly on individual or sex differences in stepping strategy. These results suggest that the stepping motions used in this study can evaluate dynamic balance ability, and that the unilateral test may be useful for the elderly who cannot walk independently with ease...|$|E

40|$|During {{vertebrate}} development, trunk {{neural crest}} cells delaminate {{along the entire}} length of the dorsal neural tube and initially migrate as a non-segmented sheet. As they enter the somites, neural crest cells rearrange into spatially restricted segmental streams. Extracellular matrix components are likely to play critical roles in this transition from a sheet-like to a stream-like mode of migration, yet the extracellular matrix components and their modifying enzymes critical for this transition are largely unknown. Here, we identified the glycosyltransferase Lh 3, known to modify extracellular matrix components, and its presumptive substrate Collagen 18 A 1, to provide extrinsic signals critical for neural crest cells to transition from a sheet-like migration behavior to migrating as a segmental stream. Using live cell imaging we show that in lh 3 null mutants, neural crest cells fail to transition from a sheet to a stream, and that they consequently enter the somites as multiple streams, or stall shortly after entering the somites. Moreover, we demonstrate that transgenic expression of lh 3 in a small subset of somitic cells adjacent to where neural crest cells <b>switch</b> from <b>sheet</b> to stream migration restores segmental neural crest cell migration. Finally, we show that knockdown of the presumptive Lh 3 substrate Collagen 18 A 1 recapitulates the neural crest cell migration defects observed in lh 3 mutants, consistent with the notion that Lh 3 exerts its effect on neural crest cell migration by regulating post-translational modifications of Collagen 18 A 1. Together these data suggest that Lh 3 –Collagen 18 A 1 dependent ECM modifications regulate the transition of trunk neural crest cells from a non...|$|R

40|$|Three {{separate}} till {{units are}} recognized on Orkney deposited {{during the last}} ice sheet glaciation: the Digger, Scara Taing and Quendal Till members. The Digger Till records an ice advance from the south that extended on to the Atlantic shelf. The Scara Taing Till records a later period of full ice cover when ice moved from the SE out of the Moray Firth and reached Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) limits on the shelf edge. The Quendal Till records a late phase of ice sheet flow from the SE to limits c. 20  km west of Orkney. No till unit or flow set has been identified to confirm {{the presence of a}} local ice cap on southern Orkney during the last glaciation. Whilst the blocking presence of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet (FIS) and the Shetland Ice Cap {{may have contributed to the}} deflection of ice flow over Orkney, similar flow patterns also occurred before and after the LGM. Scandinavian erratics on northern Orkney are probably reworked and provide no direct support for the passage of the FIS. Middle to Late Carboniferous palynomorphs found in tills in eastern Orkney may have been reworked from nearby Permian mudstones. Orkney carries the distinctive ‘shelly boulder clay’, a mud-rich till including far-travelled erratics and abraded Pleistocene marine shell fragments (Peach & Horne 1880). The shelly boulder clay has been long interpreted as a single stratigraphic unit deposited in the last glaciation (Peach & Horne 1880). Yet detailed lithological data exist for multiple till sequences (Rae 1976) and three separate till units have been identified on Rousay (Hall 1996 b), implying a greater complexity in the lithostratigraphic record on Orkney that is comparable to that in Caithness (Hall & Riding 2016) and Buchan (Merritt et al. in press). This paper assembles a Late Pleistocene stratigraphic framework for Orkney and derives from it a new event stratigraphy. Till units are linked to indicator erratics derived from Scotland and Scandinavia and to palynomorph assemblages derived from erosion of mud rocks in the Moray Firth basin. These far-travelled components provide important evidence of changing ice flow patterns on Orkney through the last glaciation and point to <b>switching</b> ice <b>sheet</b> configurations in adjacent parts of the North Sea...|$|R
40|$|Exchange {{rate policy}} in many {{emerging}} markets shifts between a stronger and weaker commitment to peg. This observation raises the following questions, which we address in our paper: Does intervention policy exhibit switching? And if so, what causes policy to shift? The theoretical literature increasingly {{points to the}} critical importance of financial fundamentals (Chinn, M. D., Kletzer, K. M., 2001. Imperfect information, domestic regulation and financial crises. In: Glick, R., Moreno, R., Spiegel, M. (Eds.), Financial Crises in Emerging Markets. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp. 196 - 237; Dooley, 2000; Chang, R., Velasco, A., 2005. Monetary policy and the currency denomination of debt: {{a tale of two}} equilibria. Kennedy School of Government Working Paper Series, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts; among others). Direct empirical validation to date is limited, however, although relevant intuitions come from duration and indicators literature (Kaminsky, G. L., Reinhart, C. M., Vegh, C. A., 2004. When it rains, it pours: procyclical capital flows and macroeconomic policies. NBER Macroeconomics Annual, National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc.; Domac, I., Peria, M. S., 2003. Banking crises and exchange rate regimes: is there a link? Journal of International Economics 61, 41 - 72; Tudela, M., 2004. Explaining currency crises: a duration model approach. Journal of International Money and Finance 23, 799 - 816). We use a panel of quarterly data starting 1985 through 2004 for 14 countries, mainly from Latin America and East Asia, and adopt a novel two-step empirical strategy. First, we apply regime switching methods to two simple indices of central bank exchange rate policy. This generates likelihoods of high and low intervention. In the second step, we establish the variables that determine these probabilities. We find strong evidence that the economy's balance sheet and economic performance determine the likelihood of switching in the exchange rate regime. Specifically, an increase in reserve currency debt relative to assets raises potential capital losses from devaluation and reduces the probability of switching to a low intervention regime, as does a decline in growth. The purpose here is not to present an alternative regime classification (Levy-Yeyati, E., Sturzenegger, S., 2005. Classifying exchange rate regimes: deeds vs. words. European Economic Review 49, 1603 - 1635; Reinhart, C. M., Rogoff, K., 2004. The modern history of exchange rate arrangements: a reinterpretation.

40|$|Systemic amyloid light-chain (LC) {{amyloidosis}} is {{a disease}} process characterized by the pathological deposition of monoclonal LCs in tissue. All LC subtypes are capable of fibril formation although lambda chains, particularly those belonging to the lambda 6 type, are overrepresented. Here, we report the thermodynamic and in vitro fibrillogenic properties of several mutants of the lambda 6 protein 6 aJL 2 in which Pro 7 and/or His 8 was substituted by Ser or Pro. The H 8 P and H 8 S mutants were almost as stable as the wildtype protein and were poorly fibrillogenic. In contrast, the P 7 S mutation decreased the thermodynamic stability of 6 aJL 2 and greatly enhanced its capacity to form amyloid-like fibrils in vitro. The crystal structure of the P 7 S mutant showed that the substitution induced both local and long-distance effects, such as the rearrangement of the V(L) (variable region of the light chain) -V(L) interface. This mutant crystallized in two orthorhombic polymorphs, P 2 (1) 2 (1) 2 (1) and C 222 (1). In the latter, a monomer that was not arranged in the typical Bence-Jones dimer was observed for the first time. Crystal-packing analysis of the C 222 (1) lattice showed the establishment of intermolecular beta-beta interactions that involved the N-terminus and beta-strand B and that these could be relevant in the mechanism of LC fibril formation. Our results strongly suggest that Pro 7 is a key residue in the conformation of the N-terminal <b>sheet</b> <b>switch</b> motif and, through long-distance interactions, is also critically involved in the contacts that stabilized the V(L) interface in lambda 6 LCs.
