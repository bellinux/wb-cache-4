5|$|From February 10 to 11, a low {{pressure}} system developed near the Rockies and moved towards the Great Plains of the United States.

It then moved over eastern Quebec on February 14 before exiting northeastern Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador on February 16. It dumped over <b>six</b> <b>inches</b> (15cm) of snow across numerous areas from Iowa to New Brunswick, including major cities such as Akron, Detroit, Champaign-Urbana, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Springfield, Peoria, Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, Dayton, Toledo, Cincinnati, London, Hamilton, the Niagara Region, Toronto, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Trois-Rivières, Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec City, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Rochester, Windsor, Syracuse and Albany.

5|$|In {{the early}} stages of {{mobilisation}} the men of the AIF were selected under some of the toughest criterion of any army in World War I and it is believed that roughly 30 per cent of men that applied were rejected on medical grounds. In order to enlist, men had to be aged between 18 and 35 years of age (although it is believed that men as old as 70 and as young as 14 managed to enlist), and they had to be at least five foot <b>six</b> <b>inches</b> tall (168 centimetres), with a chest measurement of at least 34inches (86 centimetres). Many of these strict requirements were lifted later in the war, however, as the need for replacements grew. Indeed, casualties among the initial volunteers were so high, that of the 32,000 original soldiers of the AIF only 7,000 would survive {{to the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{hurricane}} remained near the coastline, Hurricane David failed to cause extreme damage in Florida. The storm's winds shattered windows in stores near {{the coast and}} caused property damage, including blowing {{the frame of the}} Palm Beach Jai Alai fronton and downing the 186-foot (57-m) WJNO AM radio tower in West Palm Beach into the Intracoastal Waterway. A few roofs were torn off, and numerous buildings were flooded from over <b>six</b> <b>inches</b> (150 mm) of rainfall. A 450-foot (140-m) crane was even snapped in two at the St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant. The hurricane spawned over 10 tornadoes while passing over the state, though none caused deaths or injuries. Total damages in Florida amounted to $95 million ($270 million in 2005 USD), of which $30 million occurred in Palm Beach County, mostly from crop damage. Two journalists with TODAY newspaper from Brevard County followed {{the hurricane}} path from South Florida to Cocoa, FL and experienced extremely high winds as they reported on the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In Texas, most of {{the damage}} was due to inland flooding. Heavy {{rainfall}} of 6 to 18inches (150 to 450mm) was reported across a large swath of Texas. The heaviest measured amount was 17.4inches (426mm) near Monroe City, Texas. Rainfall amounts of two to <b>six</b> <b>inches</b> were common throughout {{the eastern part of}} the state. In total, 38 houses were flooded in southeast Texas. The freshwater flooding resulted in the evacuation of 20 families in Chambers County. 250 people had to evacuate from their homes near Abilene, Texas due to floodwater. The storm surge impacts were fairly minor, ranging from 3 to 5feet (1.2 to 1.8 m) above mean sea level. A portion of State Highway 87 was flooded from the storm surge, although no significant property damage was reported as a result of it. Minor beach erosion and street flooding was also reported on Galveston Island. The highest wind gust on land was 51mph (82km/h) at Scholes Field. There were two tornadoes confirmed as a result of Dean. One touched down on High Island in Galveston County, and the other touched down near Anahuac. Both tornadoes were rated as F0 on the Fujita scale, with minor damage.|$|E

5|$|Yao {{first tried}} {{out for the}} Shanghai Sharks junior team of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) when he was {{thirteen}} years old, and practiced ten {{hours a day for}} his acceptance. After playing with the junior team for four years, Yao joined the senior team of the Sharks, where he averaged 10points and 8rebounds a game in his rookie season. His next season was cut short when he broke his foot {{for the second time in}} his career, which Yao said decreased his jumping ability by four to <b>six</b> <b>inches</b> (10 to 15cm). The Sharks made the finals of the CBA in Yao's third season and again the next year, but lost both times to the Bayi Rockets. When Wang Zhizhi left the Bayi Rockets to become the first NBA player from China the following year, the Sharks finally won their first CBA championship. During the playoffs in his final year with Shanghai, Yao averaged 38.9points and 20.2rebounds a game, while shooting 76.6% from the field, and made all 21 of his shots during one game in the finals.|$|E
5|$|Leaf {{would again}} play poorly, as he threw four interceptions on December 3 against the San Francisco 49ers and {{completed}} only 9 of 23 passes on December 10 against the eventual Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens. He improved on December 17, completing 23 of 43 passes for 259 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception, but San Diego {{lost to the}} Carolina Panthers 30–22. In the Chargers' final drive, with nearly two minutes remaining in the game, Leaf completed a 10-yard pass to Curtis Conway that referees ruled was <b>six</b> <b>inches</b> short of the end zone. On first down, however, miscommunication between Leaf and running back Jermaine Fazande resulted in a fumble and 8-yard loss, and the next two plays followed by a penalty forced a fourth down and goal 10 yards from the end zone, and Leaf's fourth down pass was incomplete. On {{the final game of}} the season on December 24, Leaf made a 71-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Graham on the first play from scrimmage, but San Diego lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers 34–21. In the game, Leaf completed 15 of 29 passes for 171 yards, 1 touchdown, and 1 interception and fumbled his final snap. After finishing the season 1–15, the Chargers released Leaf on February 28, 2001. In three years with San Diego, Leaf had only four wins as a starter. For the 2000 season, Leaf completed 50% (161 of 322) of his passes for 1,883 yards, 11 touchdowns, and 18 interceptions.|$|E
