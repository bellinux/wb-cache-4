25|$|The {{part that}} I never really {{developed}} {{is the death}} of Luke and Leia's mother. I had a backstory for her in earlier drafts, but it basically didn't survive. When I got to Jedi, I wanted {{one of the kids}} {{to have some kind of}} memory of her because she will be a key figure in the new episodes I'm writing. But I really debated whether or not Leia <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> her.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{historians of}} the concept <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> the {{influential}} Simula 67. Simula was the first object-oriented programming language, and its classes were nearly identical to the modern concept as used in Java, C++, and C#. The class concept of Simula was also a progenitor of the package in Ada and the module of Modula-2. Even when developed originally in 1965, Simula classes could be included in library files and added at compile time.|$|E

25|$|Russert {{does not}} recall stating to Libby, in this conversation, {{anything}} about the wife of former ambassador Joe Wilson. Although he could not completely {{rule out the possibility}} that he had such an exchange, Russert was at a loss to remember it, and moreover, he believes that this would be the type of conversation that he would or <b>should</b> <b>remember.</b> Russert acknowledged that he speaks to many people on a daily basis and it is difficult to reconstruct some specific conversations, particularly one which occurred several months ago.|$|E
25|$|Nigamananda {{said that}} one <b>should</b> <b>{{remember}}</b> that death is coming. Before working on good or evil deeds one should also remember that death is not far off. Contemplating death drives away the desire for sensual pleasure and evil thoughts and stops acts of injustice. Attachment to wealth and relations will then diminish. Earthly matters remain even after departure from this world. Only spiritual wealth remains as an asset to the individual. Those who have puffed with pride on account of their accomplishments will submit to the God of death meekly when that hour comes. Drunk with pride, some persons ill-treat their brethren. They will {{be left in the}} deserted crematory ground with the beasts and birds joyously waiting to feast upon their flesh. Thinking of this will drive evil thoughts from the mind.|$|E

500|$|In {{the movie}} Apollo 13, Glynn Lunney was portrayed by Marc McClure. However, McClure had a {{relatively}} minor role. Writer Charles Murray lamented the fact that Lunney was [...] "barely visible in the movie", being overshadowed by the focus on Lunney's fellow flight director Gene Kranz. [...] "Without slighting Kranz's role", Murray commented, [...] "the world <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> that it was Glynn Lunney ... who orchestrated a masterpiece of improvisation that moved the astronauts safely to the lunar module while sidestepping a dozen potential catastrophes that could have doomed them." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{spokesperson}} for Hollyoaks confirmed that Ste didn't realise [...] "how much {{power and control}} Brendan was wielding over him". This was because Ste was still {{coming to terms with}} his sexuality. Ste felt a connection he never felt before because he hadn't had another male partner. Brendan manipulated Ste into believing he was to blame for Brendan's anger. The representative said this was why he ended up apologising. The storyline also aimed to shock viewers with the [...] "dark depths" [...] Brendan would go to in order to control Ste. Marquess later stated that Brendan's past would be explained and that everyone <b>should</b> <b>remember</b> it was Ste who used to hit Amy first, adding: [...] "So it's a dark and interwoven story made all the more complicated by the introduction of a new love interest for Ste".|$|E
