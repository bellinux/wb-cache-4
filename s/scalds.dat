On 5 January 1985, she had part of her left lung removed; the operation drew parallels with that of her father over 30 years earlier. In 1991, she quit smoking, though she continued to drink heavily. In January 1993, she was admitted to hospital for pneumonia. She experienced a mild stroke in 1998 at her holiday home in Mustique. Early the following year the Princess suffered severe <b>scalds</b> to her feet in a bathroom accident, which affected her mobility to the extent that she required support when walking and sometimes used a wheelchair. In January and March 2001, further strokes were diagnosed, which left her with partial vision and paralysis on the left side. Margaret's last public appearances were at the 101st birthday celebrations of her mother in August 2001 and the 100th birthday celebration of her aunt, Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, that December.|$|E

The possibility {{that this type of}} pure steam treatment can be used to avoid the conventional <b>scald</b> tank was investigated in a broiler and a turkey processing plant using a batch scale vacuum tank. Steam <b>scalded</b> birds were interspersed with birds on the same picking line used for tank <b>scalded</b> birds. Pure steam at sub-atmospheric pressure readily provided a uniform <b>scald</b> of either dry or damp birds. A steam temperature of 124 °F.

Under subscald conditions (134 - 138 °F.) typical subscald broilers, fowl, and turkeys were obtained by a 1 min. treatment. As anticipated, the air sacs of steam <b>scalded</b> birds had very few bacteria compared with the air sacs of tank <b>scalded</b> birds (more than 1, 000 -fold difference). However, after passing through the evisceration line and chiller the total bacterial load on the birds <b>scalded</b> by the two methods was similar.

40|$|In two turkey {{processing}} {{plants in the}} northwest of Germany, skin samples were taken at 4 different positions (prior to <b>scalding,</b> after plucking, before and during chilling), which {{was repeated three times}} per sampling day (two days). The <b>scalding</b> technique was different (steam respectively water <b>scalding).</b> Samples were examined for total aerobic plate count as a hygiene parameter and the zoonotic agents Salmonella and Campylobacter. The examinations followed § 35 LMBG, DIN 10113 - 1 and DIN-ISO DIS 10272. After identification, Salmonella and a selection of Campylobacter isolates were characterized using molecularbiological pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). It was the aim of this study to reflect the influence of steam <b>scalding</b> on the microbiological status of the turkey skin compared to water <b>scalding</b> and the distribution of zoonotic agents under different <b>scalding</b> techniques. <b>Scalding</b> is generally recognised a a weak point in poultry processing. <b>Scalding</b> by steam {{is considered to be a}} potential alternative to water <b>scalding.</b> In abattoir one (water <b>scalding),</b> an average total aerobic plate count was obtained lg 4 and 5. No significant reduction of the total aerobic plate count during <b>scalding</b> and plucking was observed. In the end, the microbial count at the chilling position was lower than in the beginning. In abattoir two (steam <b>scalding),</b> the total aerobic plate count was between lg 3, 63 and lg 7, 13. The microbial count was lower after plucking than prior to <b>scalding.</b> A reduction of the total aerobic plate count was sometimes significant. However, during the following procedures the microbial count increased. So in the end, steam <b>scalding</b> had no impact on the microbial count underlining the importance of the complete processing line. In abattoir one (water <b>scalding),</b> 58 % of the samples were Salmonella positive. 6 Salmonella serovars (S. Typhimurium, S. Indiana, S. Agona, S. Heidelberg, S. of Group B and S. Saintpaul) were recovered. No Salmonella was identified at the first position of sampling. 42 % of the samples were Campylobacter positive (C. jejuni und C. coli). In abattoir two (steam <b>scalding),</b> 22 % of the samples were Salmonella positive which were recovered at each of the 4 sampling sites. Salmonella serovars were S. Typhimurium, S. Heidelberg und S. Saintpaul. Altogether 89 % of the samples were Campylobacter positive at each sampling site: C. jejuni, C. coli and C. lari were identified. The results of PFGE demonstrate, that both, Salmonella and Campylobacter strains are being transferred through the whole processing line demonstrating the lack of critical points with respect to both zoonotic agents. With respect to restrictive legislation on zoonotic agents in the near future, the poultry processing lines must become more safe with respect to bacterial transfer...|$|R

40|$|Background: ‘Honeycrisp’ is {{an apple}} {{cultivar}} that {{is susceptible to}} soft <b>scald,</b> a chilling injury expressed as necrotic patches on the peel. Improved understanding of metabolism associated with the disorder would improve our understanding of soft <b>scald</b> and contribute to developing more effective management strategies for apple storage. It was expected that specific gene expression and specific metabolite levels in the peel would be linked with soft <b>scald</b> risk at harvest and/or specific time points during cold storage. Results: Fruit from nine ‘Honeycrisp’ apple orchards that would eventually develop different incidences of soft <b>scald</b> between 4 and 8 weeks of cold air storage were used to contrast and determine differential transcriptomic and metabolomic changes during storage. Untargeted metabolic profiling revealed changes {{in a number of}} distinct pathways preceding and concurrent with soft <b>scald</b> symptom development, including elevated γ-aminobutryic acid (GABA), 1 -hexanol, acylated steryl glycosides, and free p-coumaryl acyl esters. At harvest, levels of sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid acyl esters were relatively higher in peel of fruit that did not later develop the disorder. RNA-seq driven gene expression profiling highlighted possible involvement of genes and associated metabolic processes with soft <b>scald</b> development. These included elevated expression of genes involved in lipid peroxidation and phenolic metabolism in fruit with soft <b>scald,</b> and isoprenoid/brassinosteroid metabolism in fruit that did not develop soft <b>scald.</b> Expression of other stress-related genes in fruit that developed soft <b>scald</b> included chlorophyll catabolism, cell wall loosening, and lipid transport while superoxide dismutases were up-regulated in fruit that did not develop the disorder.

Broilers were stunned with carbon dioxide or Micrographics. electricity prior to slaughter to evaluate feather release force (FRF), and shear value, pH, and R-value of Pectoralis. Broilers (n = 72) were stunned using an electrical saline stunner (35 mA, 7 s) or a shackle-line carbon dioxide gas stunning tunnel (15 to 40 % CO 2 gradient for 90 s). After bleeding for 90 s, the broilers were <b>scalded</b> with a soft <b>scald</b> (53 C for 120 s) or a softer <b>scald</b> (53 C for 90 s). Within 2 min after <b>scalding,</b> feathers from the right femoral feather tract were removed perpendicularly using a force gauge to evaluate FRF. Following evisceration and chilling, breast fillets were harvested at 1. 5 h postmortem for pH, R-value, and cooked meat shear value. The results indicated that there were no significant (P >. 05) differences in FRF, shear value, pH, or R-value due to stunning method. FRF results indicated that {{there were no significant differences}} between the two stunning treatments (CO 2 and electrical) for either <b>scalding</b> treatment. However, the FRF for the soft <b>scald</b> was higher than that for the softer <b>scald.</b> These results suggest that this carbon dioxide stunning method does not influence FRF, the necessary <b>scalding</b> conditions, or rigor mortis development relative to electrical stunning...|$|R
