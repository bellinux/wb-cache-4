40|$|The novel {{software}} defined radio (SDR) technology allows taking {{the next step in}} the evolution of military tactical communications. SDRs allow military radio operators to change waveforms on-the-fly according to the mission needs. On the one hand, new wideband networking waveforms will offer new services like high data throughputs and mobile ad-hoc networking capabilities. On the other hand, legacy waveforms will ensure interoperability to legacy equipment in missions where both types of radios are deployed at the same time. In this article, we analyze if an added value can be provided to the operators at SDRs hosting an 'enhanced' legacy waveform. This enhancement shall be introduced such that interoperability to the legacy equipment is still guaranteed. The modern concept of hierarchical modulation allows fulfilling this side constraint. While the legacy waveform acts as base-layer, some enhancement-layers offer extra bit budget to transmit additional information.

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} dominates {{practically every}} aspect of the design of wireless camera networks (WCNs), and duty cycling of radios and cameras is an important tool for achieving high energy efficiencies. However, duty cycling in WCNs is made complex by the camera nodes having to anticipate the arrival of the objects in their field-of-view. What adds to this complexity is the fact that radio duty cycling and camera duty cycling are tightly coupled notions in WCNs. Abstract In this dissertation, we present a predictive framework to provide camera nodes with an ability to anticipate the arrival of an object in the field-of-view of their cameras. This allows a predictive adaption of network parameters simultaneously in multiple layers. Such anticipatory approach is made possible by enabling each camera node in the network to track an object beyond its direct sensing range and to adapt network parameters in multiple layers before the arrival of the object in its sensing range. The proposed framework exploits a single <b>spare</b> <b>bit</b> in the MAC header of the 802. 15. 4 protocol for creating this beyond-the-sensing-rage capability for the camera nodes. In this manner, our proposed approach for notifying the nodes about {{the current state of the}} object location entails no additional communication overhead. Our experimental evaluations based on large-scale simulations as well as an Imote 2 -based wireless camera network demonstrate that the proposed predictive adaptation approach, while providing comparable application-level performance, significantly reduces energy consumption compared to the approaches addressing only a single layer adaptation or those with reactive adaptation. ...|$|E

40|$|Opportunistic access {{has been}} {{considered}} by regu- lators {{for a number of}} different spectrum bands. In this paper, we discuss and qualitatively evaluate techniques used in the discovery of spectrum opportunities, also called white spaces, in the radar, TV, and cellular bands. These techniques include spectrum sensing, cooperative spectrum sensing, geolocation databases, and the use of beacons. We make the case that each of the three bands considered calls for a different set of spectrum access techniques. While TV bands are well matched to the adoption of geolocation databases, a database-assisted spectrum sensing mechanism may represent the most efficient solution to exploit the spectrum holes in radar bands. We drew this conclusion based on a multitude of factors, such as the radar antennas? constant motion, and the absence of a hidden node problems in these bands. The unpredictability of cellular systems, on the other hand, calls for a more coordinated spectrum access approach, namely beacon signaling, that could be implemented using the already established cellular infrastructure and <b>spare</b> <b>bits</b> of its logical channels...|$|R
40|$|Programs {{sometimes}} crash due to unusable values, for example, when Java and C # programs dereference null pointers {{and when}} C and C++ programs use undefined values to affect program behavior.

This paper presents efficient origin tracking of unusable values; it shows how to record where these values come into existence, correctly propagate them, and report them if they cause an error. The key idea is value piggybacking: when the original program stores an unusable value, value piggybacking instead stores origin information in the <b>spare</b> <b>bits</b> of the unusable value. Modest compiler support alters the program to propagate these modified values through operations such as assignments and comparisons. We evaluate two implementations: the first tracks null pointer origins in a JVM, and the second tracks undefined value origins in a memorychecking tool built with Valgrind. These implementations show that origin tracking via value piggybacking is fast and often useful, and in the Java case, has low enough overhead for use in a production environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{wireless}} {{commercial and}} military communications systems, where bandwidth is at a premium, robust low-bit-rate speech coders are essential. They operate at fix bit rates and those bit rates cannot be altered without major modifications in the vocoder design. In this paper, {{a novel approach}} to vocoders, {{in order to reduce}} the bit rate required to transmit speech signal, is proposed. While traditional low-bit-rate vocoders code original input speech, the proposed procedure operates on the time-scale modified signal. The proposed method offers any bit rate from 2400 b/s to downwards without modifying the principle vocoder structure, which is the new NATO standard, Stanag 4591, Mixed Excitation Linear Prediction (MELP) vocoder. We consider the application of transmitting MELP-encoded speech over noisy communication channels by applying different modulation tech-niques, after time-scale compression is applied. Three different time-scale modification algorithms have been evaluated and waveform similarity overlap and add (WSOLA) algorithm has been selected for time-scale modification purposes. Computer simulation results, both source and channel, are presented in terms of objective speech quality metrics and informal subjective listening tests. Design parameters such as codec complexity and delay are also investigated. Simulation results lead to a possible wireless communications system, whose performance might be enhanced by using the <b>spared</b> <b>bits</b> offered by the procedure.

For the selection of the signals, the hearing ability in an ageing population was also taken into consideration.
