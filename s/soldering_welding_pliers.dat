40|$|Fluids {{engineering}} {{is extremely important}} {{in a wide variety}} of materials processing systems, such as <b>soldering,</b> <b>welding,</b> extrusion of plastics and other polymeric materials, Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), composite materials manufacturing. In particular, mixed convection due to moving surfaces is very important in these applications. Mixed convection in a channel, as a result of buoyancy and motion of one of its walls has received little research attention and few guidelines are available for choosing the best performing channel configuration, particularly when radiative effects are significant. In this study a numerical investigation of the effect of radiation on mixed convection in air due to the interaction between a buoyancy flow and an unheated moving plate induced flow in a uniformly heated convergent vertical channel is carried out. The moving plate has a constant velocity and moves in the buoyancy force direction. The principal walls of the channel are heated at uniform heat flux. The numerical analysis is accomplished by means of the commercial code Fluent. The effects of the wall emissivity, the minimum channel spacing, the converging angle and the moving plate velocity are investigated and results in terms of air velocity and temperature fields inside the channel and wall temperature profiles, both of the moving and the heated plates, are given.

40|$|Background: Laser tissue {{soldering}} (LTS) is {{an alternative}} technique to suturing for tissue repair that avoids foreign body reaction and provides immediate sealing of the wound. One of the major drawbacks of LTS, however, is the weak tensile strength of the <b>solder</b> <b>welds</b> when compared to sutures. In this study, a crosslinking agent of low cytotoxicity was investigated {{for its ability to}} enhance the bond strength of albumin solders with sheep intestine. Study Design/Materials and Methods: <b>Solder</b> strips were <b>welded</b> onto rectangular sections of sheep small intestine using a diode laser. The laser delivered in continuous mode a power of 170 [*]±[*] 10 mW at λ[*]=[*] 808 nm, through a multimode optical fiber (core size[*]=[*] 200 μm) to achieve a dose of 10. 8 [*]±[*] 0. 5 J/mg. The solder thickness and surface area were kept constant throughout the experiment (thickness[*]=[*] 0. 15 [*]± 0. 01 mm, area[*]=[*] 12 [*]±[*] 1. 2 mm 2). The solder was composed of 62 % bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0. 38 % genipin, 0. 25 % indocyanin green dye (IG), and water. Tissue welding was also performed with a BSA solder without genipin, as a control group. The repaired tissue was tested for tensile strength by a calibrated tensiometer. Murine fibroblasts were also cultured in extracted media from heat-denatured genipin solder to assess cell growth inhibition in a 48 hours period. Results: The tensile strength of the genipin solder was doubled that of the BSA solder (0. 21 [*]±[*] 0. 04 N and 0. 11 [*]± 0. 04 N, respectively; P[*]=[*] 10 − 15 unpaired t-test, N[*] =[*] 30). Media extracted from crosslinked genipin solder showed negligible toxicity to fibroblast cells under the culture conditions examined here. Conclusion: Addition of a chemical crosslinking agent, such as genipin, significantly increased the tensile strength of adhesive-tissue bonds. A proposed mechanism for this enhanced bond strength is the synergistic action of mechanical adhesion with chemical crosslinking by genipin. 6 page(s...|$|R

The structure parameters of molten alloys are comparedwith ones for liquid pure components and with model values. Design/methodology/approach: The structure in liquid state has been studied with use of X-raydiffractometer containing special attachment for investigation of liquid metallic alloys.
