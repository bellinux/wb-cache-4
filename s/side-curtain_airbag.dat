Because these fleets typically sell off their cars after {{two to three years}} of use, many of the Impalas that were built without <b>side-curtain</b> <b>airbags</b> became privately owned cars. Current owners may be able to tell if their car has side airbags by checking the VIN and/or by checking to see if [...] "Air bag" [...] is printed on the roof support between the front and back rows.|$|R
