Because these fleets typically sell off their cars after {{two to three years}} of use, many of the Impalas that were built without <b>side-curtain</b> <b>airbags</b> became privately owned cars. Current owners may be able to tell if their car has side airbags by checking the VIN and/or by checking to see if [...] "Air bag" [...] is printed on the roof support between the front and back rows.|$|R

About 5,000 Chevrolet Cobalts and Buick LaCrosses were also purchased with the side air bags omitted. Enterprise admitted that it inaccurately advertised and sold 745 Chevrolet Impalas—model years 2006 through 2008—that were identified online as having side air bags, {{when in fact they}} did not. A company spokesman said that it would inform customers who had bought the cars, and offer to buy them back from the customers.According to Safety Research and Strategies, a safety research firm that regularly works with the automotive industry, deleting safety features is a highly unusual practice. [...] "I’ve never seen a standard safety feature removed from a vehicle. I’ve been doing this work for 17 years and, until now, had yet to see this happen,” said Sean Kane of Safety Research and Strategies.|$|R
