40|$|This {{study was}} an {{exploratory}} {{examination of the}} relationship between participation in <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> dancing and self-reports of personality and physical health. Using an Internet-based survey of dancers and non-dancers, it was found that <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> dancing tends to increase physical health for men and for dancers who primarily dance in the role as a leader. It was also found that as the number of styles and amount of time that individuals spent participating in <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> dancing increased, the self-reported measures of self-esteem, cognitive flexibility, resourcefulness also increased while the measures of social withdrawal decreased. The findings of the present study also indicate a higher frequency of positive experiences as opposed to negative experiences directly attributed to participation in <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> dancing. These {{results of the present study}} suggest a need for more in depth research on the mental health benefits of <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> dancing for the general population...|$|R

25|$|Hamilton {{originally}} {{suggested that}} high relatedness could arise in two ways: direct kin recognition between individuals or limited dispersal, or population viscosity, which can keep relatives together. The {{easiest way to}} generate relatedness between <b>social</b> <b>partners</b> is limited dispersal, a mechanism in which genetic similarity correlates with spatial proximity. If individuals do not move far, then kin usually surrounds them. Hence, any act of altruism would be directed primarily towards kin. This mechanism {{has been shown in}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria, where cooperation is disfavored when populations are well mixed, but favored when there is high local relatedness.|$|E
25|$|This {{mechanism}} {{is similar to}} {{what happens with the}} green-beard effect, but with the green-beard effect, the actor has to instead identify which of its <b>social</b> <b>partners</b> share the gene for cooperation. A green-beard system must always co-occur within individuals and alleles to produce a perceptible trait, recognition of this trait in others, and preferential treatment to those recognized. Examples of green-beard behavior have been found in hydrozoans, slime molds, yeast, and ants. An example is in side-blotch lizards, where blue-throated males preferentially establish territories next to each other. Results show that neighboring blue-throats are more successful at mate guarding. However, blue males next to larger, more aggressive orange males suffer a cost.|$|E
25|$|By-product benefit arises as a {{consequence}} of <b>social</b> <b>partners</b> having a shared interest in cooperation. For example, in meerkats, larger group size provides a benefit to all the members of that group by increasing survival rates, foraging success and conflict wins. This is because living in groups is better than living alone, and cooperation arises passively as a result of many animals doing the same thing. By-product benefit can also arise as {{a consequence}} of subordinate animals staying and helping a nest that is dominated by leaders who often suffer high mortality rates. It has been shown that cooperation would be most advantageous for the sex that is more likely to remain and breed in the natal group. This is because the subordinate will have a higher chance to become dominant in the group as time passes. Cooperation in this scenario is often seen between non-related members of the same species, such as the wasp Polistes dominula.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} simple, biologically-inspired {{mechanism}} by which synthetic entities {{can be made to}} form social relationships with each other. We describe an interactive multi-agent system, based on the social behavior of the gray wolf (Canis lupus), that features this mechanism of social relationship formation. This installation, shown at SIGGRAPH 2001, allowed several participants to direct semi-autonomous wolf pups in a virtual pack. In our mechanism, an entity has an emotional state that is affected by its interactions. It is able to recognize a <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> as the same individual on successive encounters. It learns an association between interacting with that <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> and its own current emotional state [...] an "emotional memory" of the partner. When the entity again encounters the <b>social</b> <b>partner,</b> its emotional memory of that partner influences its current emotional state. The emotional state, in turn, affects its expressive range of behavior. Finally, in the wake of each interaction, the entity revises its model of its emotional relationship with the <b>social</b> <b>partner.</b> Our mechanism for social relationship formation could be of use in a variety of domains, for example, creating believable virtual characters, building multi-agent systems, and designing human-computer interfaces...|$|R

2500|$|The {{ability to}} {{visually}} identify previous <b>social</b> <b>partners</b> {{is essential for}} successful interactions because it aids in recognizing which partners can and cannot be trusted.

This finding suggests that neonates are able to remember, recognize, and differentiate between faces. [...] Further research suggests that humans prefer to attend to faces rather than non-face alternatives. [...] Such specialized processing for faces aids in the encoding of memory for people. [...] This preference is one explanation for why humans are more proficient at memorizing faces than non-faces.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{researchers}} such as Randolph Nesse {{have proposed}} that grief {{is a kind of}} psychological pain that orients the sufferer to a new existence without the deceased and creates a painful but instructive memory. If, for example, leaving an offspring alone at a watering hole led to the offspring’s death, grief creates an intensively painful memory of the event, dissuading a parent from ever again leaving an offspring alone at a watering hole. [...] More recently, Winegard, Reynolds, Winegard, Baumeister, and Maner argued that grief might be a socially selected signal of an individual’s propensity for forming strong, committed relationships. From this social signaling perspective, grief targets old and new <b>social</b> <b>partners,</b> informing them that the griever is capable of forming strong social commitments. That is, because grief signals a person's capacity to form strong and faithful social bonds, those who displayed prolonged grief responses were preferentially chosen by alliance partners. The authors argue that throughout human evolution, grief was therefore shaped and elaborated by the social decisions of selective alliance partners.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{have shown that}} children with autism would increase in social responsiveness after being imitated by an adult, regardless whether the adult was a stranger or the child’s caregiver (Nadel et al, 2000; Escalona et al., 2002; Field et al., 2001; Heimann et al., 2006; Sanefuji, Yamashita & Ohgami, 2009; Sanefuji & Ohgami, 2011). Although no direct comparison has been made between the familiar and unfamiliar adult’s imitation effect on children with autism, existing literature has provided evidence suggesting that children with autism tend to preferentially display social behaviors towards their caregiver than to an unfamiliar person (Kasari, Sigman, Yirmiya, 1993; Kasari & Sigman, 1997). With that, the present study aimed to examine whether familiarity with the imitating <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> would induce a differential social responsiveness from children with autism after being imitated. A modified version of Nadel et. al (2000) ’s still face paradigm served as the basic procedure for the two conditions in the study - the familiar <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> condition (caregiver) and the unfamiliar <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> condition (experimenter). A total of 9 children with autism took part in both conditions in a repeated measures design. It was found that children with autism showed an increase in their proximity behaviors and also engaged in less solitary play after being imitated by their parent, but not after being imitated by the unfamiliar experimenter. The study highlighted the importance of familiarity with the <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> for children with autism in an imitative context and further discussed how this familiarity factor comes into play in a domestic and clinical setting...|$|R
