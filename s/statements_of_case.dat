50|$|In {{the courts}} of England and Wales, under the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR), a party is {{required}} to sign a statement of truth to verify facts in the case. Part 22 of the CPR contains the rules regarding the statement of truth. In 2001 case of Kelly v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, the claimant was allowed to amend her pleading {{at the end of}} the evidence phase to have an alternative pleading based on the evidence from the defendant side. In 2002 case of Clarke v Marlborough Fine Art (London) Limited, the court would allow pleading alternative facts. These were followed by the 2003 case of Binks v Securicor Omega Express Ltd, where the claimant submitted an amendment to the pleading {{at the end of the}} trial with another version of pleading that was contradictory to the original pleading. The trial court rejected the submission citing that Part 22 of the CPR would not allow conflicting versions of the complaint. However, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales disagreed and found that the purpose of Part 22 of the CPR is not to exclude the possibility of pleading inconsistent facts in the alternative. The series of these rulings showed that the requirement for a statement of truth does not prevent pleading alternative facts. In the past, there used to have rules for <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>case</b> which expressly allow alternative facts. A guideline for drafting <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>case</b> written in 2016 suggested that when raising the alternative facts, it should only be the case that the party understands that one of those sets of facts is true but does not know which. However, the alternative facts cannot be raised if the party has a knowledge to conclude that one of them must be a lie.|$|E
50|$|Civil {{procedure}} in South Africa is the formal rules and standards that courts follow {{in that country}} when adjudicating civil suits (as opposed to procedures in criminal law matters). The legal realm is divided broadly into substantive and procedural law. Substantive law is that law which defines the contents of rights and obligations between legal subjects; procedural law regulates how those rights and obligations are enforced. These rules govern how a lawsuit or case may be commenced, {{and what kind of}} service of process is required, along with the types of pleadings or <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>case,</b> motions or applications, and orders allowed in civil cases, the timing and manner of depositions and discovery or disclosure, the conduct of trials, the process for judgment, various available remedies, and how the courts and clerks are to function.|$|E
50|$|The {{pleadings}} {{are contained}} in various <b>Statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>Case</b> - usually the Claim and any associated Particulars of Claim, the Defence, and an optional reply to the Defence. The Claim, Particulars of Claim, and Defence, are broadly equivalent to the Summons, Complaint and Answer filed in some other jurisdictions). The pleadings set out succinctly the claims made by each side, and their legal basis, and provide a basis to explore the issues in the case. They must specify the basic facts which are alleged, but need not evidence those facts or any extensive legal argument (these are addressed at later stages of the process). Some types of allegation must be expressly stated in the appropriate statement of case, if they will be alleged or relied upon at a later stage.|$|E
