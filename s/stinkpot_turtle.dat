50|$|Turtle Park is a {{sculpture}} park created by Bob Cassilly located at Oakland Avenue and Tamm Avenue. The park contains concrete sculptures of seven turtle {{species that are}} endemic to Missouri, a clutch of eggs and a snake. The three large turtles are a snapping turtle, a Mississippi map turtle and a red-eared slider and the four smaller turtles are a <b>stinkpot</b> <b>turtle</b> and three box turtles. The snapping turtle is 40-foot long and used 120,000 pounds of concrete. The design allows kids to climb on the turtle's shells and in their open mouths.|$|E
50|$|The park {{contains}} seven turtle {{species that}} are native to Missouri {{as well as a}} clutch of eggs. The three large turtles are a snapping turtle, a Mississippi map turtle and a red-eared slider and named after Sunny Glassberg's children: Dick, Tom, and Sally. The four smaller turtles are a <b>stinkpot</b> <b>turtle</b> and three box turtles, named after Glassberg's grandchildren: David, Adam, Emily, and Antonio. The snapping turtle is 40-foot long and used 120,000 pounds of concrete. A concrete snake lines the park; its head is attached to and appears to be biting the Tamm Avenue Overpass at the west end of the park. The design allows kids to climb on the turtle's shells and into their open mouths.|$|E
5000|$|The lake {{is home to}} herons, loons, eagles, deer, snakes, <b>stinkpot</b> <b>turtles,</b> painted turtles and {{snapping}} turtles. According to older residents, there exists a very old and very large snapping turtle named Pork Chop, who is so-called because a summer resident claims to have fed the turtle pork chops each year. Stories of Ol' Pork Chop have been used successfully to coax children out of the water, {{but there have been}} no known snapping turtle attacks reported (aside from those on unsuspecting ducklings). Residents of the inlet on {{the north end of the}} lake call this turtle [...] "Scar" [...] due to a prominent laceration across his face. Aside from pork chops, Scar appears to favor leftover pizza crusts in supplement to his typical lake fare.|$|R

We assessed responses of aquatic turtles to features at multiple spatial scales in an intensively farmed region of the Midwestern United States. Spatially hierarchical sampling was conducted from 2001 to 2003 in 35 randomly selected 23 -km 2 cells throughout the upper Wabash River basin in Indiana. Hoop nets were used at wetlands to capture common snapping turtles (Chely-dra serpentina serpentina) (n= 258), midland painted turtles (Chrysemys picta marginata) (151), eastern spiny softshells (Apalone spinifera spinifera) (70), red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) (59), northern map turtles (Graptemys geographica) (27), false map turtles (Graptemys pseudogeographica pseudogeographica) (6), Blanding’s turtles (Emy-doidea blandingii) (3), and <b>stinkpot</b> <b>turtles</b> (Sternotherus odoratus) (3). We examined the degree to which these aquatic species were nonrandomly distributed in 14 landscapes. Assemblages of turtles generally were random and the extent of nestedness was influenced by the diversity of landcover, the proportion of grassland, and the total length of roads in each landscape. The occurrence and abundance of several species also were modeled to test hypotheses regarding the importance of site, patch, and landscape-level variables. Red-eared sliders appeared to be most sensitive to habitat fragmentation, whereas pain-ted turtles, snapping turtles, map turtles, and spiny softshells were less affected. Factors at multiple spatial scales affect turtle distributions, suggesting differential responses to landscape fragmentation...|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} {{signal transduction}} apparatus utilized by vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) in the vomeronasal organ (VNO) has been richly explored, while that of reptiles, and in particular, the <b>stinkpot</b> or musk <b>turtle</b> Sternotherus odoratus, is less understood. Given that the turtle 2 ̆ 7 s well-known reproductive and mating behaviors {{are governed by}} chemical communication, 247 patch-clamp recordings were made from male and female S. odoratus VSNs to study the chemosignal-activated properties {{as well as the}} second-messenger system underlying the receptor potential.

50|$|Brooker's Creek on Grenadier Island: In May 1999, 70.2 acre of ecologically {{sensitive}} wetland along Brooker's Creek on {{the north}} side of Grenadier Island became part of the park. The property is physically connected with other wetland property in the Park. It is protected as a wetland of high importance for conservation and high resource sensitivity. Two bird species found here, the least bittern and red-shouldered hawk, are rated as species of special concern by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. The swamp woods and marshes found here are home to numerous species of breeding birds and are alive with bird song in migration seasons. Reptiles such as the <b>stinkpot</b> <b>turtle</b> and Blanding's turtle and several amphibian species including a variety of frogs and salamanders thrive in this highly productive habitat. The property is not easily accessible by the public and is protected as highly sensitive lands.|$|E
