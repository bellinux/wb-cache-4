5|$|On 3 April 2016, the South Stand {{was renamed}} the Sir Bobby Charlton <b>Stand</b> <b>before</b> {{kick-off}} of the Premier League home match against Everton, {{in honour of}} Manchester United legend Sir Bobby Charlton who made his Manchester United debut 60 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Nausicaä liberates {{the baby}} Ohm and gains its trust. She and the Ohm <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> the raging herd and are run over. The Ohm {{calm down and}} use their golden tentacles to {{resuscitate}} her. Nausicaä, her dress drenched blue with Ohm blood, walks atop hundreds of golden Ohm tentacles as through golden fields, fulfilling the saviour's prophecy. The Ohm and Tolmekians leave the Valley, and the Pejites remain with the Valley people, helping them to rebuild. Deep underneath the Toxic Jungle, a non-toxic tree sprouts next to Nausicaä's lost aviation goggles.|$|E
5|$|The ground has {{undergone}} several major changes since its original construction in 1905. The original Main Stand, boasting a press loft and a balcony above the roof, burnt down in 1921, {{and was replaced}} by the current <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> the 1922–23 campaign. The new Main Stand was split into two: the upper tier contained wooden seats, so there was a ban on smoking in the stand; the lower tier, which became known as the Enclosure, was terracing.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from being}} an {{obligatory}} religious duty, the Hajj is seen to have a spiritual merit that provides the Muslims with an opportunity of self-renewal. Hajj serves {{as a reminder of}} the Day of Judgment when Muslims believe people will <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> God. Hadith literature (sayings of Muhammad) articulates various merits a pilgrim achieves upon successful completion of their Hajj. After successful pilgrimage, pilgrims can prefix their names with the title 'Al-Hajji', and are held with respect in Muslim society. However, Islamic scholars suggest Hajj should signify a Muslim's religious commitment, and should not be a measurement of their social status. Hajj brings together and unites the Muslims from {{different parts of the world}} irrespective of their race, colour, and culture, which acts as a symbol of equality.|$|E
5|$|Differences between Rama Rao and Varalakshmi {{due to the}} latter's tantrums, also occurred. When Varalakshmi {{refused to}} touch Rama Rao's feet in the scene in which his father drags him from the {{marriage}} hall, Prasad asked Nagi Reddy's son B. L. N. Prasad—the second assistant cameraman working under Bartley—to wear a dhoti and <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> her. Chakrapani liked a scene in a play in which a group of police officers in ascending hierarchy, each junior gave up his chair for the senior; he used the same idea in Savitri's marriage sequences in the film. Similarly, Prasad incorporated part of a stage play enacted by children into the film, which Nagi Reddy's son Venkatarami Reddy was a part of. Prasad also made a cameo appearance in the film.|$|E
5|$|Australia won the toss and Barnes and Morris put on 136 for {{the opening}} <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> the latter fell for 65. Barnes and Bradman then added 207 for the second wicket. Barnes' 176 came in 255 minutes and Bradman made 146 in 165 minutes. After Bradman {{departed}} at 403/3, wickets began to fall more regularly, but Hassett held up his end and made 110, while Tallon remained unbeaten on 50. Surrey's Test paceman Alec Bedser took 4/104. On the second afternoon, Surrey scored 141 runs in three hours in their first innings. Johnson took 5/53 and Laurie Fishlock carried his bat for 81 not out, but received little support, the next highest scores being 15 and 10. Australia enforced the follow on and took two early wickets before stumps on the second day. They made continual inroads on the final day, and Surrey were all out for 195 to complete an innings win. Johnston took 4/40 and Johnson 3/40.|$|E

5|$|From stanzas 22 to 24, {{more details}} are given by Odin about Valhalla: the holy {{doors of the}} ancient gate Valgrind <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> Valhalla, Valhalla has five hundred and forty doors that eight hundred men can exit from at once (from which the einherjar will flow forth to engage the wolf Fenrir at Ragnarök). Within Valhalla exists Thor's hall Bilskirnir, and within it exist five hundred and forty rooms, {{and of all the}} halls within Valhalla, Odin states that he thinks his son's may be greatest. In stanzas 25 through 26, Odin states that the goat Heiðrún and the hart Eikþyrnir stand on top of Valhalla and graze on the {{branches}} of the tree Læraðr. Heiðrún produces vats of mead that liquor cannot be compared to, and from Eikþyrnir's antlers drip liquid into the spring Hvergelmir from which flows forth all waters.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December, Vandermaesen made a <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> Port Napoleon, {{defending}} {{the entrance to}} the town with his available regular troops and some small cannon. Keating attacked him, engaging the French front while a second attack by Madras sepoys outflanked the French line and disrupted it, allowing a successful frontal assault. With their defences breached the French fell back and on 2 December Decaen proposed a ceasefire, which was accepted. The following day Decaen surrendered, although with guarantees that he and the garrison would be repatriated and allowed to retain their personal arms and Eagles. Although some in the British force were unhappy with the terms of the surrender, the British commanders were relieved to have the invasion complete before the hurricane season began later in the month. The danger to the 70 ships in the British fleet from such a storm was serious and it was vitally important that they be in a safe harbour when the hurricane season began.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{was built}} with one <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> {{the opening of}} another in 1928 which could hold 18,000 people to replace an earth embankment. It hosted its first {{international}} match in March 1911 with a Welsh match against Scotland. Towards {{the end of its}} lifespan, the ground eventually was replaced by Cardiff Arms Park as increasing doubts mounted over the safety of the aging ground. The club record attendance in the ground is 57,893 which was achieved during a league match against Arsenal on 22 April 1953. The record stands to this day, and is unlikely to be beaten due to the scaling down of grounds throughout the 1970s and 1980s due to safety fears, which saw the ground capacity fall to 22,000. In its final years of its use, the club was forced to seek special dispensation from authorities {{in order to keep the}} remaining standing areas of the ground open as clubs at Championship level or above were given three years to redevelop their grounds to remove standing areas.|$|E

Kevin reluctantly punches Chiron until {{he is unable to}} <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> watching as Terrel and several other students stomp on him. When a social worker urges him to reveal his attackers' identities, Chiron refuses, stating that reporting them will not solve anything. The following day, Chiron smashes a chair over Terrel's back and is subsequently arrested. As the police escort Chiron out of school, he glares at Kevin.|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} to prominence in 1984 {{as a senior}} cabinet minister in Brian Mulroney's cabinet, retiring from politics after not standing for re-election for the House of Commons in 1993. He made a political comeback in 1998 to lead the Progressive Conservatives in their last <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> the party's eventual dissolution, serving his final term in Parliament from 2000 to 2004. Clark today is recognized as a distinguished scholar and statesman, {{and serves as a}} university professor and as president of his own consulting firm.|$|E
25|$|A shrine {{adjacent}} to the southern sanctuary contains several famous icons, including one of the Virgin Mary dating to the 14th century. The Virgin Mary is seated on a tree that grows {{from the back of}} Jesse (Isaiah 11:1-10). She is surrounded by four major and twelve minor prophets, above whom are two angels. According to tradition, whenever Pope Matthew I fell into temptation, he would <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> this icon and address it in supplication. The Virgin Mary would appear before him to comfort his soul. It is also said that Saint Ruweiss prayed before this icon.|$|E

25|$|After being {{informed}} {{he needed}} to attend a hearing on a felony child abuse charge, Jorge Barahona tried twice to injure himself.

At the hearing, his bail was set for $1 million. He later attempted again to injure himself and was taken to a hospital for a CT scan, then returned to jail and placed in the mental health unit.|$|E

After returning to America, Wolverine finds himself approached at the airport by Magneto and Xavier while learning of a new threat to all mutants.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} account (by the Official Annamese Chronicles) {{states that}} Taksin {{was ordered to}} be executed in the traditional siamese way by General Chao Phraya Chakri at Wat Chaeng: by being sealed in a velvet sack and beaten {{to death with a}} scented sandalwood club. There was an account claiming that Taksin was secretly sent to a palace located in the remote mountains of Nakhon Si Thammarat where he lived until 1825, and that a substitute was beaten to death in his place. King Taksin's ashes and those of his wife are located at Wat Intharam (located in Thonburi). They have been placed in two lotus bud shaped stupas which <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> the old hall.|$|E
