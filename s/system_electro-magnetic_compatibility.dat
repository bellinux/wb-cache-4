30|$|At the circuit/system level, {{asynchronous}} design {{methods have}} been drawing continued interest from the research community {{over the past few}} decades due to several inherent advantages such as low noise (Paver et al. 1998) and almost nil electro-magnetic interference (Bouesse et al. 2004), greater modularity (van Kees Berkel et al. 1999), capacity to withstand process, temperature, and parametric variations (Kulikowski et al. 2008; Chang et al. 2010), consumption of power only when and where active (van Kees Berkel et al. 1999; Akgun et al. 2010), and being self-checking (David et al. 1995). Low noise and <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>compatibility</b> imply that asynchronous circuits are inherently resistant to side channel attacks (Yu et al. 2003; Sokolov et al. 2005) and are therefore preferable for secure environments demanded in cyber physical systems, banking and financial applications, and other consumer and industrial applications. Modularity, also known as design reusability, and the ability to tolerate process, temperature and parametric variations signifies that asynchronous circuits are well placed to cope with statistical timing analysis and reliability issues whilst delivering a good average case performance (Sparsø and Furber 2001). Due to power consumption only on demand, depending on when and where required, asynchronous circuits form a natural choice for low power VLSI designs where complimentary design strategies such as multiple supplies, multiple thresholds, and dynamic voltage and/or frequency scaling may be employed to leverage the maximum benefits from an asynchronous design.|$|R
