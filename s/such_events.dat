5|$|Most lunar {{scientists}} will acknowledge that transient {{events such as}} outgassing and impact cratering do occur over geologic time: the controversy lies {{in the frequency of}} <b>such</b> <b>events.</b>|$|E

5|$|However, it is {{more common}} to find Ediacaran fossils under sandy beds {{deposited}} by storms or high-energy bottom-scraping ocean currents known as turbidites. Soft-bodied organisms today rarely fossilize during <b>such</b> <b>events,</b> but the presence of widespread microbial mats probably aided preservation by stabilising their impressions in the sediment below.|$|E
5|$|Staunton {{proposed}} {{and was the}} principal organiser of the first international chess tournament, which proved that <b>such</b> <b>events</b> were possible, and which produced a clear consensus on who was the world's strongest player—Adolf Anderssen. All subsequent international tournaments took place in Great Britain until Paris 1867.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} in 1844 {{is said to}} have {{wiped out}} the population of Cuban macaws from Pinar del Río. Subsequent hurricanes in 1846 and 1856 further destroyed their habitat in western Cuba and scattered the remaining population. In addition, a tropical storm hit the Zapata Swamp in 1851. With a healthy macaw population, <b>such</b> <b>events</b> could have been beneficial by creating suitable habitat. However, given the species' precarious position, it may have resulted in fragmented habitat and caused them to seek food in areas where they were more vulnerable to hunting.|$|E

5|$|American {{alligators}} will occasionally prey {{on large}} mammals, such as deer, but will usually do so when fish and smaller prey levels go down. Rarely, American alligators {{have been observed}} killing and eating bobcats, but <b>such</b> <b>events</b> are not common and have little effect on bobcat populations. Although American alligators have been listed as predators of West Indian manatees, very little evidence exists of such predation. In the 2000s, when invasive Burmese pythons occupied the Everglades, American alligators have been recorded preying on them, possibly controlling populations, thus preventing the invasive species to spread up north.|$|E
5|$|At home, staying {{informed}} about volcanic activity, and having contingency plans {{in place for}} alternative shelter locations, constitutes good preparedness for an ash fall event. This can prevent some impacts associated with ash fall, reduce the effects, and increase the human capacity to cope with <b>such</b> <b>events.</b> A few items such as a flashlight, plastic sheeting to protect electronic equipment from ash ingress, and battery operated radios, are extremely useful during ash fall events.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, William Gray noticed a trend of low {{hurricane}} {{activity in the}} North Atlantic basin during El Niño years. He was the first researcher to make a connection between <b>such</b> <b>events</b> and positive results led him to pursue further research. He found numerous factors across the globe influence tropical cyclone activity, such as connecting wet periods over the African Sahel {{to an increase in}} major hurricane landfalls along the United States East Coast. However, his findings also showed inconsistencies when only looking at a single factor as a primary influence.|$|E

5|$|On 13 October 1990, {{meteoroid}} EN131090, with {{an estimated}} mass of 44kg, entered the Earth's atmosphere above Czechoslovakia and Poland and, after a few seconds, returned to space. Observations of <b>such</b> <b>events</b> are quite rare; {{this was the second}} recorded using scientific astronomical instruments (after the 1972Great Daylight Fireball) and the first recorded from two distant positions, which enabled the calculation of several of its orbital characteristics. The encounter with Earth significantly changed its orbit and, to a smaller extent, some of its physical properties (mass and structure of its outer layer).|$|E
5|$|On 26 July 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope {{captured}} a rare transit made by Ariel on Uranus, which {{cast a shadow}} {{that could be seen}} on the Uranian cloud tops. <b>Such</b> <b>events</b> are rare and only occur around equinoxes, as the moon's orbital plane about Uranus is tilted 98° to Uranus's orbital plane about the Sun. Another transit, in 2008, was recorded by the European Southern Observatory.|$|E
5|$|On September 11, 2012, the U.S. {{diplomatic}} mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, {{resulting in the}} deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S. On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after <b>such</b> <b>events.</b>|$|E

5|$|On the Eastern Shore {{island of}} Chincoteague the annual Pony Swim & Auction of feral Chincoteague ponies {{at the end}} of July is a unique local {{tradition}} expanded into a week-long carnival. The Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival is a six-day festival held annually in Winchester that includes parades and bluegrass concerts. The Old Time Fiddlers' Convention in Galax, begun in 1935, {{is one of the oldest}} and largest <b>such</b> <b>events</b> worldwide. Two important film festivals, the Virginia Film Festival and the VCU French Film Festival, are held annually in Charlottesville and Richmond, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The administration's {{response}} to racial violence was minimal, {{causing him to}} lose black support. When black postmasters at Hogansville, Georgia in 1897, and at Lake City, South Carolina the following year, were assaulted, McKinley issued no statement of condemnation. Although black leaders criticized McKinley for inaction, supporters responded by saying there was little the president could do to intervene. Critics replied by saying that he could at least publicly condemn <b>such</b> <b>events,</b> as Harrison had done.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} flooding stranded {{many residents}} who {{were forced to}} stay in place long after Hurricane Katrina had passed. Stranded survivors dotted the tops of houses citywide. Some were trapped inside attics and were unable to escape. Many people chopped their way onto their roofs with hatchets and sledge hammers, which Mayor Nagin had residents urged to store in their attics in case of <b>such</b> <b>events.</b> Clean water was unavailable, and power outages were expected to last for weeks.|$|E

5|$|The {{lieutenant}} governor is elected {{on the same}} election ticket as the Governor in a statewide election held every four years, concurrent with United States presidential elections. Should a {{lieutenant governor}} die while in office, resign, or succeed to the governorship, the constitution specifies no mechanism by which to fill vacancies in the lieutenant governor's office. Historically, the position has generally remained vacant during <b>such</b> <b>events.</b> The last attempt to fill such a vacancy in 1887 led to the outbreak {{of violence in the}} state legislature known as the Black Day of the General Assembly. However, in recent years the Governor has appointed a Lieutenant Governor if a vacancy arises.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune, {{like those of}} Uranus, {{are thought to be}} {{relatively}} young; their age is probably significantly less than that of the Solar System. Also, like those of Uranus, Neptune's rings probably resulted from the collisional fragmentation of onetime inner moons. <b>Such</b> <b>events</b> create moonlet belts, which act as the sources of dust for the rings. In this respect the rings of Neptune are similar to faint dusty bands observed by Voyager 2 between the main rings of Uranus.|$|E
5|$|Although casinos are {{not under}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the ABC, many of the regulations for casinos and casino vendors are similar to those for ABC class C retailer licensees. Casinos may generally only purchase alcoholic beverages from licensed wholesalers (i.e. ABC Class B licensees). A casino may have a brewpub on site, but production is limited to 3,000 barrels of beer per year, and the beer may only be distributed in open containers on casino floor and in hotel areas of the casino. Casinos may obtain a permit to have tastings, and tasting dinners. Non-profit organizations may obtain a permit to have a social event at a casino where they charge for alcoholic beverages. Organizations are limited to 12 casino social event permits per year, and a given casino may only host 25 <b>such</b> <b>events</b> per year.|$|E
