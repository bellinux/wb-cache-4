Between 1809 and 1811, Toulmin lived in Birmingham on Paradise Row, and he died there on 23 July 1815, at the age of seventy-five.|$|E

[...] The USAF agreed to take over funding for Frost's Special Projects Group, and a contract for US$750,000 followed in 1955. By 1956, Avro management was interested enough to commit $2.5 million to build a [...] "private venture" [...] prototype. In March 1957, the Air Force added additional funding, and the aircraft became Weapons System 606A.|$|E

5000|$|The {{asteroid}} {{itself is}} an elongated prolate spheroid {{which appears to}} be virtually identical to Juno, a large asteroid in the main belt. It has been hollowed out along its long axis, and subdivided into seven vast cylindrical chambers, and rotates to provide artificial gravity. The chambers are terraformed, with the second and third containing vast abandoned cities which have been maintained by automatic systems for centuries. As the Earth investigators explore the asteroid's interior, they make an even more stunning discovery — the end of the Stone's seventh chamber opens out into a vast cylindrical corridor ("The Way"), a [...] "pocket universe" [...] that extends far beyond the physical limit of the asteroid, and may possibly be infinite. These discoveries indicate both that the Stone's creators (who are dubbed the [...] "Stoners") have mastered the technology to open portals into other dimensions and alternate universes, and that, for unknown reasons, these original inhabitants had been evacuated from the Stone at some time in its past, and could well be living <b>somewhere</b> further <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way.</b>|$|R

He later wakes in a jail cell meeting Nadia (Bérénice Marlohe), a French foreign aide doctor who tells him they were taken prisoner by a gang of thugs. She calls him [...] "Bo" [...] after seeing the letters on his torn name tag. Nadia explains to Bo that the world had been invaded by strange machines that wiped out all the major cities and defeated the military around the world. Bo only recalls fragments {{of what happened to}} him and also exhibits the ability to absorb and discharge electricity {{as a result of his}} close encounter with one of the machines. After escaping the jail, Bo and Nadia work together trying to survive and get to the safety of Bo's military base that is <b>somewhere</b> near Nairobi. <b>Along</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> Nadia is taken by the aliens and Bo finds his base in ruins. He eventually enters the ruins of Nairobi where he meets a group of resistance fighters who plan to use an EMP bomb on the alien's support ship that hovers over the city and bring it down.|$|R
500|$|Deadline.com's Dominic Patten {{also had}} {{praise for the}} season, {{particularly}} Rosenberg's influence on it, the coverage of topics such as [...] "PTSD, abuse, assault, shame, and death" [...] and the cast, highlighting Tennant's Kilgrave as the actor's best role {{as well as the}} MCU's best villain. Mary McNamara from the Los Angeles Times felt Jessica Jones [...] "rewrote the definition of superhuman" [...] and was [...] "a marvel", lauding the season's [...] "breathtaking" [...] examination of recovery from a sexually, emotionally and physically abusive relationship. Daniel Fienberg for The Hollywood Reporter was also positive, saying the season [...] "looks and feels a bit like a cable anti-hero series—but it's really more of a post-hero story, making it fascinating and unique in a marketplace that doesn't lack for costumed do-gooders of all types." [...] His one criticism was that [...] "the show shares Jessica's monomaniacal fixation on [...] and the result is a sort of narrative claustrophobia...Everything in these opening episodes ties back to Kilgrave and Kilgrave is such a twisted figure that it's hard for any light to get in." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly was slightly more critical of the season, awarding it a [...] "B". Though Maerz felt Ritter was a good choice for Jessica and enjoyed the cinematography, she felt the season [...] "could've made for a gritty character drama if it weren't for the noir clichés (saxophone music, shadows through glass) and a procedural structure that's very CSI: Marvel. The show's biggest weakness is the same as Jessica's: It starts out with extraordinary potential, but <b>somewhere</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> it loses what make it special." ...|$|E
500|$|A black marketeer {{who makes}} a living dealing Kaiju organs. Perlman stated, [...] "I {{actually}} think this character {{was designed to be}} played by another ethnicity other than myself. And <b>somewhere</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> [...] had the notion, 'Wouldn't it be interesting to turn this guy into more of an invention.' So, in other words, somebody takes on a persona that completely sounds like he's someone else and acts like he's someone else but he's really, you know, as you see me. That added a dimension to the larger-than-life aspect of the character… I'm playing somebody very close to my own origins. But a completely made-up persona… which makes him even more full of shit. And I think that's the charm of the guy—that he's kind of elusive, hard to pin down." [...] Pacific Rim marks Perlman's fifth appearance in a del Toro film. The director stated: [...] "I think the moment you have a guy that is called Hannibal Chau and Ron shows up, and he's from Brooklyn and he's been selling black market organs, you know the whole story… That's all I need to know. If it's any other actor, there's a lot more explaining to do. But when Ron comes in with that look, {{you can make your own}} story and it'll be as compelling as anything I can invent. You do a little weightlifting with the audience." [...] The bird tattoos on Chau's fingers indicate his past as a gangster. In the film, Chau states he took the name from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn. Del Toro drew inspiration from Burt Lancaster's performance in Elmer Gantry when writing the character.|$|E

Furthermore, while Ruby Walsh's prediction a month earlier: [...] "Faugheen's unbeaten over timber but <b>somewhere</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that may go" [...] came true on his reappearance, the jockey found the actual defeat discouraging: [...] "It’s disappointing, he didn’t pick up like he can, but that’s horse racing isn’t it?

Although his daughter, Elizabeth, was born at the beginning of July, for unexplained reasons De Vere did not learn of her birth until late September.|$|E
2500|$|Metaphorically {{centered}} around the title1, Orrery is a single story told from the inclusion of well over 70 poems written in different styles and divided into three main sections: 'Hours' (time), 'Apples' (memory), and 'Physics.' A prelude of sorts to The Invention of the Zero, Orrery poses {{the belief that the}} world is now being mechanically driven, but it presents the view in a different fashion. The book centers around a long poem based on his experience at an apple cider farm in Vermont; 'Apples.' To Kenney, the cider mill represents [...] "a relic of that pre-electrical world...A comprehensible world, in many ways...None of it seems to have left this farm, at any rate--...crippled dance steps, disassembled stories, half-hummed tunes, all common property--disintegration projects...with the confusion of common sense, as it sometimes seems, from the decay of the clockwork universe" [...] (Orrery ix, Kenney).
