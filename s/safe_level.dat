The US Environmental Protection Agency designated 0.05 parts per million (ppm) of ozone to be a <b>safe</b> <b>level.</b> Lamps designed to release UVC and higher frequencies are doped so that any UV light below 254nm wavelengths will not be released, to minimize ozone production. A full-spectrum lamp will release all UV wavelengths, and will produce ozone when UVC hits oxygen (O2) molecules.|$|E

This process, though occurring in the brain, is outside conscious control.|$|E
25|$|The IARC and WHO {{designate}} {{airborne particulates}} a Group 1 carcinogen.

In 2013, a study involving 312,944 people in nine European countries revealed that there was no <b>safe</b> <b>level</b> of particulates and that for every increase of 10 μg/m3 in PM10, the lung cancer rate rose 22%. The smaller PM2.5 were particularly deadly, with a 36% increase in lung cancer per 10 μg/m3 as it can penetrate deeper into the lungs.|$|E

25|$|Dental and {{aluminum}} researchers then moved toward determining a relatively <b>safe</b> <b>level</b> of fluoride {{to be added}} to water supplies. The research had two goals: (1) to warn communities with a high concentration of fluoride of the danger, initiating a reduction of the fluoride levels in order to reduce incidences of fluorosis, and (2) to encourage communities with a low concentration of fluoride in drinking water to add fluoride in order to help prevent tooth decay. By 2006, 69.2% of the U.S. population on public water systems were receiving fluoridated water, amounting to 61.5% of the total U.S. population; 3.0% of the population on public water systems were receiving naturally occurring fluoride.|$|E
25|$|The {{initial stage}} of {{research}} yielded the following results: experts developed a common terminology {{to describe the}} protective properties of the respirators; a methodology for measuring protection factors in different conditions of respirators' usage in the workplaces and laboratories; and the realization that national legislation should set limits {{for the use of}} all types of respirators based on their performance, measured not in the laboratory, but in the workplaces. The first studies also clearly confirmed that the use of respirators is the most unreliable method of protecting workers from all known methods. Therefore, respirators should be used only when other methods can not be used; or when other methods can not reduce the exposure of air pollution on people to an acceptable <b>safe</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although lead is {{the least}} {{expensive}} dense (SG=11.34) material available, it is a toxic substance causing biological damage to wildlife and humans. The Centers for Disease Control has stated that no <b>safe</b> <b>level</b> of lead exposure in children has been determined, and that once lead has been absorbed into the body, its effects cannot be corrected. Even a very small amount of exposure causes a permanent reduction in intelligence, ability to focus attention, and academic ability. Lead can be inhaled or ingested as either a metal powder or powdered corrosion products, however most lead salts have very low solubility in water, and pure lead corrodes very slowly in seawater. Absorption through skin is not likely for metallic lead and inorganic corrosion products.|$|E

25|$|The European Union (EU) uses {{a linear}} dose {{response}} curve at low-levels of exposure, below {{the point where}} there are epidemiological data. In other words, the EU assumes there is no <b>safe</b> <b>level</b> of dioxins and PCBs. Accordingly, the European Union sets extremely stringent limits for dioxin and dioxin like PCBs in food, set just above the usual background levels found in various food categories e.g. fish, poultry, beef, pork etc. The limit set for dioxins in pork fat and meat is 1 pg/g TEQ i.e. 1 parts per trillion (ppt) (see swimming pool illustration). The maximum dioxin contamination measured in Irish pork was 0.2 ng/g TEQ fat (200 ppt), equivalent to dispersing 10 drops of TCDD throughout a 2.5 million litre Olympic sized swimming pool.|$|E
25|$|Many {{adverse effects}} of {{licorice}} poisoning can be seen and most are attributed to the mineralocorticoid effects of GZA. Depending on the dose and intake of licorice, serious problems and even hospitalization can arise. People with previously existing heart or kidney problems may be more susceptible to GZA and licorice poisoning. It is important to monitor the amount of licorice consumed {{in order to prevent}} toxicity. It is difficult to determine a <b>safe</b> <b>level,</b> due to many varying factors from person to person. In the most sensitive individuals, daily intake of about 100mg GZA can cause problems. This is equivalent to 50 g licorice sweets. However, in most people, they can consume up to 400mg before experiencing symptoms, which would be about 200 g licorice sweets. A rule of thumb says a normal healthy person can consume 10mg GZA a day.|$|E
25|$|Capacitors may {{retain a}} charge long after power {{is removed from}} a circuit; this charge can cause {{dangerous}} or even potentially fatal shocks or damage connected equipment. For example, even a seemingly innocuous device such as a disposable-camera flash unit, powered by a 1.5 volt AA battery, has a capacitor which may contain over 15 joules of energy and be charged to over 300 volts. This is easily capable of delivering a shock. Service procedures for electronic devices usually include instructions to discharge large or high-voltage capacitors, for instance using a Brinkley stick. Capacitors may also have built-in discharge resistors to dissipate stored energy to a <b>safe</b> <b>level</b> within a few seconds after power is removed. High-voltage capacitors are stored with the terminals shorted, as protection from potentially dangerous voltages due to dielectric absorption or from transient voltages the capacitor may pick up from static charges or passing weather events.|$|E
