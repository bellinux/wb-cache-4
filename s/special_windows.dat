25|$|While in battle, {{characters}} {{status is}} displayed in <b>special</b> <b>windows</b> {{on the battle}} screen: their window shows their current health, their Blast gauge (an energy bar linked to special abilities), and Spirit Chain (SC) gauge, which fuels the ability to link characters and perform special attacks. A high level of SC points grants conditional boons to characters, such as dealing higher damage and faster recovery of SC. Characters {{have the option to}} side-step (dodge forward, backward or to the side), and precisely timed dodges can allow characters to stagger enemies and fill the SC gauge. The Blast gauge allows characters to trigger a blast of energy which knocks enemies back and heals injuries. The SC gauge allows for a maximum of four linked attacks, and any remaining points in the gauge can be used for later linked attacks. The order of activation for linked attacks cannot be changed. At the end of battles, if certain requirements are fulfilled, characters can learn skills called Battle Acts, abilities that grant the characters advantages in battle, such as being able to run around the field freely.|$|E

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the inverse filter to noise is often {{thought to be the}} reason that inverse fllter restorations of motion-blurred images are normally dominated by errors. In this paper, we show that {{even in the absence of}} noise, there is a large error component, called the edge error, that arises due to the fact that real images seldom have the periodicity implicitly assumed by discrete Fourier transform operation. An analysis shows that the edge error has a triangular-wave structure with an amplitude proportional to the difference between the average pixel intensity levels of the left and right edges of the image. For the central region of an image, the edge error may be reduced by using Wiener filtering instead of inverse filtering. However, the restored images show reduced reso-lution as well as ghosting and ringing effects. We also derive mathematically a <b>special</b> <b>window</b> for treatment of the edge error. A sign&ant improvement in the quality of restorations is achieved with the use of this <b>special</b> <b>window.</b> The best restorations are obtained by subjecting the windowed-blurred image to a Wie-ner filter of large signal-to-noise ratio. 8 1591 Academic press, hf.

5000|$|Typically, {{users of}} a GUI {{can affect the}} Z-order by {{selecting}} a window {{to be brought to}} the foreground (that is, [...] "above" [...] or [...] "in front of" [...] all the other windows). Some window managers allow interaction with windows while they are not in the foreground, while others will bring a window to the front whenever it receives input from the user. It is also possible for <b>special</b> <b>windows</b> to be designated [...] "always on top"; these are then fixed {{to the top of the}} Z-order so that (with few exceptions) no other window can overlap them.|$|E

The KZ filter has two parameters, the length m of the moving average window and the number of iterations k of the moving average itself.

50|$|Forbes Park is a multi-use {{development}} in Chelsea, Massachusetts. It comprises 17 acre along the Chelsea River and Mill Creek.

30|$|The FAC {{algorithm}} {{is one of}} the key technologies in USAC, which enables the successful combination of two different types of codecs, especially at transition frames. To remove the aliasing terms caused by cascading different types of codecs, FAC additionally generates the aliasing cancellation signals, and then they are quantized and transmitted to the decoder. In the earlier version of USAC that had not introduced the FAC technique, the frame boundary of transition frame was variable; thus, a <b>special</b> <b>windowing</b> operation was needed for compensating the aliased signal in the overlap region. Although FAC somewhat solves the problem, it still requires additional bits.|$|R
50|$|After a rollover, {{the vehicle}} {{may end up}} lying on its side or roof, often {{blocking}} the doors and complicating the escape for the passengers. Large passenger vehicles such as buses, trams, and trolley buses that have doors on one side only usually have one or more methods of using windows for escape {{in case of a}} rollover. Some have <b>special</b> <b>windows</b> with handles to pull so that windows can be used as an emergency exit. Some have tools for breaking the windows and making an improvised exit. Some have emergency exit door or hatches in their roofs or {{on the opposite side of}} the bus to the usual entry door. Some combine two or more of these escape methods.|$|E
50|$|In 1980 {{the trains}} theme {{received}} a major overhaul. The builds were {{adapted to the}} minifigure, having appeared a few years earlier. The colour of the tracks was changed from blue to grey, and the 12-volt transformer changed to support utility functions in a more streamlined style with control switches that docked alongside the transformer, following the design style of increasingly streamlined model train controls of the time. The utility functions now included remotely controlled points, signals, wagon de-couplers and level crossings. The models gained a much more realistic appearance, including some with much longer carriage/wagon bodies and swivel bogies, and there were <b>special</b> <b>windows</b> which simulated having a pull-down glass section. The railcar bases were now again assembled from train-specific wheels and coupler and a greatly increased number of universal pieces.|$|E
5000|$|The Silver Case is a text-based {{point and}} click {{adventure}} visual novel video game where players {{take control of}} different characters through two linear scenarios: in the [...] "Transmitter" [...] scenario, players take {{the role of a}} detective solving a serial murder mystery, while in the [...] "Placebo" [...] scenario, they control a freelance journalist covering the investigation. During gameplay sequences, the player moves through environments in first-person. Proceeding through the scenario, story events play out in <b>special</b> <b>windows</b> against a single background: some are dedicated to text, while others show scenery related to events in the game. These scenery are a combination of 2D and 3D artwork, real-world photographs incorporated into the game, limited full-motion graphics, and short live action sequences. At some points in the game, quiz questions are shown for the player to answer, in addition to mini-games the player can complete. There are also puzzles which are strongly related to the game's text-based features and presentation.|$|E
