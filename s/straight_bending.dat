60|$|The bed {{is a broad}} four-poster, {{the posts}} being beautifully wrought golden or gilded rods, {{variously}} wreathed and branched, carrying a canopy of warm red. The princess's shield is {{at the head of}} it, and the feet are raised entirely above the floor of the room, on a dais which projects at the lower end so as to form a seat, on which the child has laid her crown. Her little blue slippers lie {{at the side of the}} bed, her white dog beside them; the coverlid is scarlet, the white sheet folded half way back over it; the young girl lies <b>straight,</b> <b>bending</b> neither at waist nor knee, the sheet rising and falling over her in a narrow unbroken wave, like the shape of the coverlid of the last sleep, when the turf scarcely rises. She is some seventeen or eighteen years old, her head is turned towards us on the pillow, the cheek resting on her hand, as if she were thinking, yet utterly calm in sleep, and almost colourless. Her hair is tied with a narrow riband, and divided into two wreaths, which encircle her head like a double crown. The white nightgown hides the arm, raised on the pillow, down to the wrist.|$|E

The left arm pushes the upper body off the ground until the arm is <b>straight,</b> <b>bending</b> at the waist to keep the lower body on the ground. The body is then lowered to the starting position. The exercise is repeated on the left side to work the right triceps.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:Rubber bladder {{hydroforming}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important technology in the aircraft manufacturing industry. The springback seriously restricted the one-step forming. This paper is a research on the springback angle of <b>straight</b> edge <b>bending</b> and curved edge bending by using FEM software PAM-STAMP 2 G. Comparing the angles between the <b>straight</b> edge <b>bending</b> and the curved edge bending to get the springback regularity along the circumference. The springback angle of the curved edge bending changes along the circumference closing to a parabola and the springback angle of the edge is approaching to that of <b>straight</b> edge <b>bending...</b>|$|R
50|$|Inner lip—from {{the corner}} of the outer lip a very thin layer of nacre spreads out a little way across the body, but then ceases entirely. The columella is spread out at its base as a confined, flattened, {{unevenly}} inclined, semicircular, iridescent umbilical pad. From the left corner of which the columella proper projects, it has a narrow but rounded edge, twisted, <b>straight,</b> <b>bending</b> to the left, and advances into a sharply angulated, and, as seen from behind, even mucronated junction with the basal aperture edge, to which the umbilical pad curving round the back of the pillar also attains. The inside is scored with the external sculpture, and is brilliantly iridescent. The umbilical pad is defined by a narrow furrow, and in front by a slightly tumid ridge, which is the least nacreous part of the whole shell. The operculum is membranaceous, horny, yellowish, with about six to seven turns, each strongly defined by a narrow line of thickening, and sharply scored with minute oblique radiating lines.|$|E
40|$|Brake forming {{is widely}} {{applied in the}} high variety and small batch part {{manufacturing}} of sheet metal components, for the bending of <b>straight</b> <b>bending</b> lines. Currently, the planning of the bending sequences is a task {{that has to be}} performed manually, involving many heuristic criteria. However, set-up and bend sequencing procedures and knowledge have to be formally formalized and modeled, for the development of computer-aided process planning systems for sheet metal forming. This paper describes the application of fuzzy set theory for the normalization and modeling of the set-up and bend sequencing process for sheet metal bending. A fuzzy-set based methodology is used to determine the optimal bending sequences for the brake forming of sheet metal components, taking into account the relative importance of handling and accuracy...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the propagation of current waves along the horizontal curved wire above the ground. On {{the base of the}} exact Mixed Potential Integral Equations (MPIE) for the current and scalar potential we have developed an iteration approach, which permits to obtain solutions including corrections accounting for line radiation. The zero iteration term correspond to the classical transmission line (TL) solution. The first iteration term gives corrections to the reflection and transmission coefficients associated with the line bend. The derived analytical expressions for the <b>straight</b> <b>bend</b> are compared with “exact ” numerical results published by other authors and very good agreement is found. The developed analytical expressions {{can also be used to}} evaluate the radiated power associated with the line bend...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Metal forming by a laser {{source is}} an {{efficient}} and economical method for forming sheet metal into <b>straight</b> <b>bend</b> and doubly curved shape. It can be most {{useful in the}} automation of sheet metal forming. This paper presents an FEM model for three dimensional thermo-mechanical simulation of the laser forming. The aim of this simulation and experimental study is to identify the response related to deformation and characterize the effects of process parameters such as laser power, beam diameter, scans velocity and pulse duration, in terms of bending angle for a square sheet part. Extensive experimentation, including a design of experiments, is performed to address the above-mentioned aims. From these experiments it has been determined that laser forming using Nd:YAG laser is a flexible manufacturing process for steel sheet bending...|$|R

50|$|Bend Or was not entered for the 2000 Guineas, but {{in early}} March, {{he was the}} 5/1 {{favourite}} for the Epsom Derby. He started his three-year-old campaign in the Derby. He was ridden by Fred Archer and started as the 2/1 favourite {{in a field of}} 19. After the start, he was in a prominent position but was dropped back into mid-division by Archer. At Tattenham Corner Robert the Devil was leading from Von der Tann, Bend Or being in about the sixth position. In the <b>straight</b> <b>Bend</b> Or passed some of the horses to move into third. The second placed Mask then began to fade as he was passed by Bend Or, who went off in pursuit of Robert the Devil. Bend Or won the Derby by a head from Robert the Devil, with Mask a further six lengths back in third.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Sheet metal bending is a {{metal forming}} process, in which flat sheets are bent along <b>straight</b> <b>bend</b> lines in a {{specific}} bending sequence to form three-dimensional parts. A large number of tools with different characteristics {{can be used in}} this process. The task to choose the right tooling for a requested sheet metal part is however one of the bottle necks in process planning. An inefficient tool selection may result in failure of finding a feasible bending sequence. In previous work, methodologies for tool selection and optimization have been proposed. The presented paper describes a framework to implement these methodologies into a system that allows automatic tool selection in consistent consideration of bend sequencing. As a result, automated and optimized tool selection for sheet metal bending is achieved, as illustrated by performance test results for a robust software implementation...|$|R

The fish for stroganina is usually caught by ice fishing during the late fall and fresh frozen {{in order to avoid the}} formation of ice crystals in the meat.

40|$|Egg white foam {{is a type}} of foam (a colloid {{in which}} a gas is {{dispersed}} or spread throughout a liquid) used in meringues, souffl és, and angel food cake to make them light and porous (airy). To prepare an egg white foam, egg whites are initially beaten (with a wire wisk or electric mixer) until they become frothy. Then an acid (such as cream of tartar) is added. Depending on the application, the beating of the egg white continues until soft (when the peaks stand <b>straight</b> and <b>bend</b> slightly at the tips) or stiff peaks (when the peaks stand <b>straight</b> without <b>bending)</b> are formed. Salt and sugar may also be added. How It Works: Egg whites are made up of water, protein, and small amounts of minerals and sugars. When the egg whites are beaten, air is added and the egg white protein, albumen, is denatured. Denaturation is the change of a protein’s shape under stress (in this case, beating). The denatured protein coats the air bubbles and holds in the water, causing them t...|$|R

The direct application of this technique is channel characterization of an HVAC duct system, which behaves as a multimode waveguide network at RF frequencies when used for indoor wireless communications.
