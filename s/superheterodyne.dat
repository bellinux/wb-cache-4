5|$|The most {{important}} and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the <b>superheterodyne</b> receiver (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming radio frequency signal from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which {{is sent to the}} loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|The {{receiver}} {{is generally}} {{one of two}} types: a super-regenerative receiver or a <b>superheterodyne.</b> The super-regenerative receiver works like that of an intermittent oscillation detection circuit. The <b>superheterodyne</b> works {{like the one in}} a radio receiver. The <b>superheterodyne</b> receiver is used because of its stability, high sensitivity and it has relatively good anti-interference ability, a small package and lower price.|$|E
25|$|In electronics, a <b>superheterodyne</b> {{receiver}} uses frequency mixing or heterodyning {{to convert}} a received signal to a fixed intermediate frequency, {{which can be}} more conveniently processed than the original radio carrier frequency. Virtually all modern radio and television receivers use the <b>superheterodyne</b> principle. The <b>superheterodyne</b> receiver was invented in 1918 by Edwin Armstrong. It {{was introduced to the}} market place in the late 1920s.|$|E
50|$|Around 1947, {{the company}} {{introduced}} their first amateur radio receiver, the 75A-1 (called the 75A). This set achieved excellent stability {{for the time}} due to high build quality {{and the use of}} a permeability tuned oscillator (PTO) in its second conversion stage. It {{was one of the few}} double conversion <b>superheterodynes</b> on the market and covered only the amateur bands.|$|R
50|$|RCA also {{produced}} a console version, the model R-9. The R-7 and R-9 share identical chassis (using RCA tubes 280, 227, 235, 245 and 224). There were several {{versions of the}} R7 table (mantel) version: the R-7A using pentode output tubes (RCA 247), R-7DC and R-9DC for 110 VDC power, and the R-7 LW for long wave listening. These early <b>superheterodynes</b> had no AVC so stronger stations were louder than weaker ones.|$|R
2500|$|In the 1920s, {{commercial}} IF filters {{looked very}} similar to 1920s audio interstage coupling transformers, had very similar construction and were wired up in an almost identical manner, {{and so they were}} referred to as [...] "IF transformers". By the mid-1930s however, <b>superheterodynes</b> were using much higher intermediate frequencies, (typically around 440–470kHz), with tuned coils similar in construction to the aerial and oscillator coils. However, the name [...] "IF transformer" [...] was retained and is still used today. Modern receivers typically use a mixture of ceramic resonator or SAW (surface-acoustic wave) resonators as well as traditional tuned-inductor IF transformers.|$|R
25|$|A <b>superheterodyne</b> receiver, often {{shortened}} to superhet, {{is a type}} {{of radio}} receiver that uses frequency mixing to convert a received signal to a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) which can be more conveniently processed than the original carrier frequency. It was invented by US engineer Edwin Armstrong in 1918 during World War I. Virtually all modern radio receivers use the <b>superheterodyne</b> principle.|$|E
25|$|Superette (radio) RCA {{trademark}} {{for their}} line of <b>superheterodyne</b> receivers {{during the early}} 1930s.|$|E
25|$|One major {{disadvantage}} to the <b>superheterodyne</b> receiver is {{the problem}} of image frequency. In heterodyne receivers, an image frequency is an undesired input frequency equal to the station frequency plus twice the intermediate frequency. The image frequency results in two stations being received at the same time, thus producing interference. Image frequencies can be eliminated by sufficient attenuation on the incoming signal by the RF amplifier filter of the <b>superheterodyne</b> receiver.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1930s most car radios, no longer experimental, were <b>superheterodynes</b> {{and used a}} {{vibrator}} power supply to step up the low voltage to high voltage ("B+" [...] voltage of anywhere from 90 to 250 volts) for the vacuum tubes. Vibrators are relatively unreliable as electromechanical components of limited life, buzz audibly, and produce radio interference. A few radios used a bulkier and more expensive motor-generator or motor-alternator set called a [...] "dynamotor" [...] that spun a high-voltage generator or alternator using a 6 or 12V DC motor. Filaments were powered using 6V and later 12V DC power from the vehicle's electrical system directly.|$|R
25|$|The French {{engineer}} Lucien Lévy filed {{a patent}} application for the <b>superheterodyne</b> principle in August 1917 with brevet n° 493660.|$|E
25|$|Radio {{transmitters}} {{may also}} use a mixer stage to produce an output frequency, working more or less as the reverse of a <b>superheterodyne</b> receiver.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong {{was able}} to put his ideas into practice, and the {{technique}} was soon adopted by the military. However, it was less popular when commercial radio broadcasting began in the 1920s, mostly due to the need for an extra tube (for the oscillator), the generally higher cost of the receiver, and the level of technical skill required to operate it. For early domestic radios, tuned radio frequency receivers (TRF) were more popular because they were cheaper, easier for a non-technical owner to use, and less costly to operate. Armstrong eventually sold his <b>superheterodyne</b> patent to Westinghouse, who then sold it to RCA, the latter monopolizing the market for <b>superheterodyne</b> receivers until 1930.|$|E
25|$|The {{front end}} of an SSB {{receiver}} {{is similar to that}} of an AM or FM receiver, consisting of a <b>superheterodyne</b> RF front end that produces a frequency-shifted version of the radio frequency (RF) signal within a standard intermediate frequency (IF) band.|$|E
25|$|<b>Superheterodyne</b> {{receivers}} {{have essentially}} replaced all previous receiver designs. The development of modern semiconductor electronics negated {{the advantages of}} designs (such as the regenerative receiver) that used fewer vacuum tubes. The <b>superheterodyne</b> receiver offers superior sensitivity, frequency stability and selectivity. Compared with the tuned radio frequency receiver (TRF) design, superhets offer better stability because a tuneable oscillator is more easily realized than a tuneable amplifier. Operating at a lower frequency, IF filters can give narrower passbands at the same Q factor than an equivalent RF filter. A fixed IF also allows {{the use of a}} crystal filter or similar technologies that cannot be tuned. Regenerative and super-regenerative receivers offered a high sensitivity, but often suffer from stability problems making them difficult to operate.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to keep stray radiation from the local oscillator below the level that a nearby receiver can detect. The receiver's local oscillator can act like a low-power CW transmitter. Consequently, there can be mutual interference {{in the operation of}} two or more <b>superheterodyne</b> receivers in close proximity.|$|E
25|$|Microprocessor {{technology}} allows {{replacing the}} <b>superheterodyne</b> receiver design by a {{software defined radio}} architecture, where the IF processing after the initial IF filter is implemented in software. This technique is already in use in certain designs, such as very low-cost FM radios incorporated into mobile phones, since the system already has the necessary microprocessor.|$|E
25|$|Early <b>superheterodyne</b> {{receivers}} used IFs {{as low as}} 20kHz, {{often based}} on the self-resonance of iron-cored transformers. This made them extremely susceptible to image frequency interference, but at the time, the main objective was sensitivity rather than selectivity. Using this technique, {{a small number of}} triodes could be made to do the work that formerly required dozens of triodes.|$|E
25|$|In early 1920s Russia, Oleg Losev was {{experimenting with}} {{applying}} voltage biases to {{various kinds of}} crystals for manufacture of radio detectors. The result was astonishing: with a zincite (zinc oxide) crystal he gained amplification. This was negative resistance phenomenon, decades before {{the development of the}} tunnel diode. After the first experiments, Losev built regenerative and <b>superheterodyne</b> receivers, and even transmitters.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the tetrode vacuum tube containing a screen grid led to a multi-element tube in which the mixer and oscillator functions could be combined, first used in the so-called autodyne mixer. This was rapidly followed {{by the introduction of}} tubes specifically designed for <b>superheterodyne</b> operation, most notably the pentagrid converter. By reducing the tube count, this further reduced the advantage of preceding receiver designs.|$|E
25|$|A {{klystron}} is {{a specialized}} linear-beam vacuum tube. Klystrons {{are used as}} amplifiers at microwave and radio frequencies to produce both low-power reference signals for <b>superheterodyne</b> radar receivers and to produce high-power carrier waves for communications and the driving force for modern particle accelerator. Russell and Sigurd Varian of Stanford University are {{generally considered to be}} the inventors. Their prototype was completed in August 1937.|$|E
25|$|Radio {{receivers}} is {{the fourth}} topic that covers the principles and operation of TRF receivers and <b>Superheterodyne</b> receivers, CW reception; with receiver characteristics such as sensitivity, selectivity and fidelity; Adjacent-channel interference and image interference; AGC and squelch; and {{signal to noise ratio}} (S/R). Similarly, the next topic on transmitters covers the principles and operation of low power transmitters; oscillators such as the Colpitts oscillator, Hartley oscillator, crystal oscillators, and stability of oscillators.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{the term}} {{aliasing}} evolved from radio engineering {{because of the}} action of <b>superheterodyne</b> receivers. When the receiver shifts multiple signals down to lower frequencies, from RF to IF by heterodyning, an unwanted signal, from an RF frequency equally far from the local oscillator (LO) frequency as the desired signal, but {{on the wrong side}} of the LO, can end up at the same IF frequency as the wanted one. If it is strong enough it can interfere with reception of the desired signal. This unwanted signal is known as an image or alias of the desired signal.|$|E
25|$|The radio {{receiver}} {{turned out to}} be a more difficult problem. Early on they decided to use the same basic receiver system as the earlier Mk. IV radar. This had originally been a television receiver designed by Pye Ltd. to pick up BBC transmissions on 45MHz. It was adapted to the MK. IV's ~200MHz by using it as the intermediate frequency stage of a <b>superheterodyne</b> system. To do this, they had added another tube that stepped down the frequency from the radar's 193MHz to 45MHz. In theory this should be just as easily adapted to the AIS's 3GHz, using a similar solution. The problem was that the magnetron's frequency tended to drift, in small amounts pulse-to-pulse, and much greater amounts as it heated and cooled. Any sort of fixed-frequency step-down like the one used in the Mk. IV wouldn't work. After trying a variety of designs based on klystrons and older-style magnetrons, they eventually gave up.|$|E
25|$|As of its {{founding}} RCA {{was the largest}} radio communications firm in the United States. However, American Marconi had been falling behind industry advances, particularly in vacuum tube technology, and GE needed access to additional patents before its new subsidiary could be fully competitive. The result {{was a series of}} negotiations and a complicated set of cross-licensing agreements between various companies. On July 1, 1920, an agreement was made with the American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT), which purchased 500,000 shares of RCA, although it would divest these shares in early 1923. The United Fruit Company held a small portfolio of radio patents, and signed two agreements in 1921. GE's traditional electric company rival, the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Corporation, had also purchased rights to some critical patents, including one for heterodyne receiving originally issued to Reginald Fessenden, plus regenerative circuit and <b>superheterodyne</b> receiver patents issued to Edwin Armstrong. Westinghouse was able to use this to negotiate a cross-licensing agreement, effective July 1, 1921, that included a concession that 40% of RCA's equipment purchases would be from Westinghouse. Following these transactions, GE owned 30.1% of RCA's stock, Westinghouse 20.6%, AT 10.3%, and United Fruit 4.1%, with the remaining 34.9% owned by individual shareholders.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Hibberd had {{successfully}} {{built a new}} push–pull amplifier using two of the same tubes but working in the 1.25-meter band, an upper-VHF band (around 220MHz); below 1.25m the sensitivity dropped off sharply. Gerald Touch, originally from the Clarendon Laboratory, converted the EMI receiver to this wavelength by using the existing set as the intermediate frequency (IF) stage of a <b>superheterodyne</b> circuit. The original 45MHz frequency would remain the IF setting for many following radar systems. On its first test on 17 August, Anson K6260 with Touch and Keith Wood aboard immediately detected shipping in the English Channel at a range of [...] The team later increased the wavelength slightly to 1.5m to improve sensitivity of the receiver, and this 200MHz setting would be common to many radar systems of this era.|$|E
2500|$|By the mid-1930s, {{commercial}} production of TRF receivers was largely replaced by <b>superheterodyne</b> receivers. [...] By the 1940s the vacuum-tube <b>superheterodyne</b> AM broadcast receiver was refined into a cheap-to-manufacture design called the [...] "All American Five", because it only used five vacuum tubes: usually a converter (mixer/local oscillator), an IF amplifier, a detector/audio amp, audio power amp, and a rectifier. [...] From this time, the <b>superheterodyne</b> design {{was used for}} virtually all commercial radio and TV receivers.|$|E

2500|$|As the <b>superheterodyne</b> is {{the most}} {{developed}} and widely used radio circuit, a terminology has grown up around it: ...|$|E
2500|$|The diagram {{at right}} shows the block diagram {{of a typical}} single-conversion <b>superheterodyne</b> receiver. The diagram has blocks that are common to <b>superheterodyne</b> receivers. The antenna {{collects}} the radio signal. [...] The tuned RF stage with optional RF amplifier provides some initial selectivity; {{it is necessary to}} suppress the image frequency (see below), and may also serve to prevent strong out-of-passband signals from saturating the initial amplifier. A local oscillator provides the mixing frequency; it is usually a variable frequency oscillator which is used to tune the receiver to different stations. [...] The frequency mixer does the actual heterodyning that gives the <b>superheterodyne</b> its name; it changes the incoming radio frequency signal to a higher or lower, fixed, intermediate frequency (IF). [...] The IF band-pass filter and amplifier supply most of the gain and the narrowband filtering for the radio. [...] The demodulator extracts the audio or other modulation from the IF radio frequency; the extracted signal is then amplified by the audio amplifier.|$|E
2500|$|Local {{oscillator}} (LO) - part {{of every}} <b>superheterodyne</b> circuit, a radio frequency electronic oscillator which produces a signal that mixes with the incoming radio signal from the antenna in the mixer to generate the intermediate frequency.|$|E
2500|$|Earliest {{research}} towards {{what was}} later named the phase-locked loop {{goes back to}} 1932, when British researchers developed an alternative to Edwin Armstrong's <b>superheterodyne</b> receiver, the Homodyne or direct-conversion receiver. In the homodyne or synchrodyne system, a local oscillator was tuned to the desired input frequency and multiplied with the input signal. The resulting output signal included the original modulation information. [...] The intent was to develop an alternative receiver circuit that required fewer tuned circuits than the <b>superheterodyne</b> receiver. [...] Since the local oscillator would rapidly drift in frequency, an automatic correction signal {{was applied to the}} oscillator, maintaining it in the same phase and frequency of the desired signal. The technique was described in 1932, in a paper by Henri de Bellescize, in the French journal L'Onde Électrique.|$|E
2500|$|BC-348 {{receivers}} were copied {{and manufactured}} by the U.S.S.R. following War II by the Russian Vefon Works and labeled [...] (US-9 in English, US as Universal <b>Superheterodyne,</b> not United States.) The УС-9 {{continued to be}} produced in the Soviet Union through the 1970s, with such improvements as a solid state inverter to replace the dynamotor.|$|E
2500|$|He {{patented}} the regenerative circuit in 1914, the <b>superheterodyne</b> {{receiver in}} 1918 and the super-regenerative circuit in 1922. Armstrong presented his paper, [...] "A Method of Reducing Disturbances in Radio Signaling by a System of Frequency Modulation", (which first described FM radio) before the New York {{section of the}} Institute of Radio Engineers on November 6, 1935. The paper was published in 1936.|$|E
2500|$|For example, {{the ranges}} 29MHz to 30MHz; 28MHz to 29MHz etc. might be {{converted}} down to 2MHz to 3MHz, there {{they can be}} tuned more conveniently. This is often done by first converting each [...] "block" [...] up to a higher frequency (typically 40MHz) and then using a second mixer to convert {{it down to the}} 2MHz to 3MHz range. The 2MHz to 3MHz [...] "IF" [...] is basically another self-contained <b>superheterodyne</b> receiver, most likely with a standard IF of 455kHz.|$|E
