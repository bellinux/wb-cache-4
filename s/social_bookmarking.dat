5|$|Project Chanology {{began its}} {{campaign}} by organizing and delivering {{a series of}} denial-of-service attacks against Scientology websites and flooding Scientology centers with prank calls and black faxes. The group was successful in taking down local and global Scientology websites intermittently from January 18, 2008 until at least January 25, 2008. Anonymous had early success rendering major Scientology websites inaccessible and leaking documents allegedly stolen from Scientology computers. This resulted in {{a large amount of}} coverage on <b>social</b> <b>bookmarking</b> websites.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} {{using data from}} the <b>social</b> <b>bookmarking</b> website Delicious, has shown that collaborative tagging systems exhibit a form of complex systems (or self-organizing) dynamics. Although there is no central controlled vocabulary to constrain the actions of individual users, the distributions of tags that describe different resources has been shown to converge over time to a stable power law distributions. Once such stable distributions form, examining the correlations between different tags can be used to construct simple folksonomy graphs, which can be efficiently partitioned to obtained a form of community or shared vocabularies. Such vocabularies {{can be seen as a}} form of collective intelligence, emerging from the decentralised actions of a community of users. The Wall-it Project is also an example of <b>social</b> <b>bookmarking.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{example of}} emergence in web-based systems is <b>social</b> <b>bookmarking</b> (also called collaborative tagging). In <b>social</b> <b>bookmarking</b> systems, users assign tags to resources shared with other users, which {{gives rise to}} a type of information organisation that emerges from this crowdsourcing process. Recent research which analyzes empirically the complex dynamics of such systems has shown that consensus on stable distributions and a simple form of shared vocabularies does indeed emerge, {{even in the absence of}} a central controlled vocabulary. Some believe that this could be because users who contribute tags all use the same language, and they share similar semantic structures underlying the choice of words. The convergence in social tags may therefore be interpreted as the emergence of structures as people who have similar semantic interpretation collaboratively index online information, a process called semantic imitation.|$|E

25|$|Several {{agencies}} in the Intelligence community, most notably the CIA and NGA, have developed training programs to provide time to integrate social software tools into analysts' daily work habits. These classes generally focus {{on the use of}} Intellipedia to capture and manage knowledge, but they also incorporate the use of the other social software tools. These include blogs, RSS, and <b>social</b> <b>bookmarking.</b> The courses stress immersion in the tools and instructors encourage participants to work on a specific project in Intellipedia. The courses also expose participants to social media technologies on the Internet.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the advent}} of <b>social</b> <b>bookmarking,</b> shared {{bookmarks}} have become a means for users sharing similar interests to pool web resources, or to store their bookmarks {{in such a way}} that they are not tied to one specific computer or browser.

2500|$|Websites such as Delicious, Digg, Slashdot, Diigo, Stumbleupon, and Reddit {{are popular}} <b>social</b> <b>bookmarking</b> sites used {{in social media}} promotion. Each of these sites is {{dedicated}} to the collection, curation, and organization of links to other websites that users deem to be of good quality. [...] This process is [...] "crowdsourced", allowing amateur social media network members to sort and prioritize links by relevance and general category. [...] Due to the large user bases of these websites, any link from one of them to another, the smaller website may in a flash crowd, a sudden surge of interest in the target website. In addition to user-generated promotion, these sites also offer advertisements within individual user communities and categories. [...] Because ads can be placed in designated communities with a very specific target audience and demographic, they have far greater potential for traffic generation than ads selected simply through cookie and browser history. [...] Additionally, some of these websites have also implemented measures to make ads more relevant to users by allowing users to vote on which ones will be shown on pages they frequent. [...] The ability to redirect large volumes of web traffic and target specific, relevant audiences makes <b>social</b> <b>bookmarking</b> sites a valuable asset for social media marketers.|$|E
2500|$|Instead {{of merely}} reading a Web 2.0 site, a user {{is invited to}} {{contribute}} to the site's content by commenting on published articles or creating a user account or profile on the site, which may enable increased participation. By increasing emphasis on these already-extant capabilities, they encourage the user to rely more on their browser for user interface, application software ("apps") and file storage facilities. This has been called [...] "network as platform" [...] computing. Major features of Web 2.0 include social networking websites, self-publishing platforms (e.g., WordPress' easy-to-use blog and website creation tools), [...] "tagging" [...] (which enables users to label websites, videos or photos in some fashion), [...] "like" [...] buttons (which enable a user to indicate that they are pleased by online content), and <b>social</b> <b>bookmarking.</b> Users can provide the data that is on a Web 2.0 site and exercise some control over that data. These sites may have an [...] "architecture of participation" [...] that encourages users to add value to the application as they use it. Users can add value in many ways, such as by commenting on a news story on a news website, by uploading a relevant photo on a travel website, or by adding a link to a video or TED talk which is pertinent to the subject being discussed on a website. Some scholars argue that cloud computing is an example of Web 2.0 because cloud computing is simply an implication of computing on the Internet.|$|E
