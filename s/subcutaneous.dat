5|$|Dermal and <b>subcutaneous</b> growths {{result from}} (1) {{reactive}} or neoplastic proliferation of cellular {{components of the}} dermis or <b>subcutaneous</b> tissue, or (2) neoplasms invading or aberrantly present in the dermis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Subcutaneous</b> {{emphysema}} is when gas or air is in {{the layer}} under the skin. <b>Subcutaneous</b> refers to the tissue beneath the skin, and emphysema refers to trapped air. It is sometimes abbreviated SCE or SE and also called tissue emphysema, or Sub Q air. Since the air generally comes from the chest cavity, <b>subcutaneous</b> emphysema usually occurs on the chest, neck and face, where {{it is able to}} travel from the chest cavity along the fascia. <b>Subcutaneous</b> emphysema has a characteristic crackling feel to the touch, a sensation that has been described as similar to touching Rice Krispies; this sensation of air under the skin is known as <b>subcutaneous</b> crepitation.|$|E
5|$|Air can {{be trapped}} {{under the skin}} in necrotizing infections such as gangrene, {{occurring}} as a late sign in gas gangrene, {{of which it is}} the hallmark sign. <b>Subcutaneous</b> emphysema is also considered a hallmark of fournier gangrene. Symptoms of <b>subcutaneous</b> emphysema can result when infectious organisms produce gas by fermentation. When emphysema occurs due to infection, signs that the infection is systemic, i.e. that it has spread beyond the initial location, are also present.|$|E
5|$|Conditions of the <b>subcutaneous</b> fat {{are those}} {{affecting}} {{the layer of}} adipose tissue that lies between the dermis and underlying fascia.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{pharmacological}} therapies for DVT {{were introduced in}} the 20th century: oral anticoagulants in the 1940s, <b>subcutaneous</b> LDUH in 1962 and <b>subcutaneous</b> LMWH in 1982. Diagnoses were commonly performed by impedance plethysmography in the 1970s and 1980s, {{but the use of}} Doppler ultrasound techniques, with their increased sensitivity and specificity, largely superseded this method.|$|E
5|$|Spontaneous <b>subcutaneous</b> {{emphysema}} {{is thought}} to result from increased pressures in the lung that cause alveoli to rupture. In spontaneous <b>subcutaneous</b> emphysema, air travels from the ruptured alveoli into the interstitium and along the blood vessels of the lung, into the mediastinum and from there into the tissues of the neck or head.|$|E
5|$|<b>Subcutaneous</b> {{emphysema}} {{is often}} found in car accident victims because of {{the force of the}} crash.|$|E
5|$|Vascular-related {{cutaneous}} conditions {{result from}} dysfunction {{of the blood}} or {{blood vessels in the}} dermis, or lymphatics in the <b>subcutaneous</b> tissues.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} <b>subcutaneous</b> {{emphysema}} (air {{trapped in the}} <b>subcutaneous</b> tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. <b>Subcutaneous</b> emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E
5|$|Difficult {{situations}} {{arise in}} deficiencies of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis in people (both men and women) who experience infertility; infertility in hypopituitarism may {{be treated with}} <b>subcutaneous</b> infusions of FSH, human chorionic gonadotropin–which mimics the action of LH–and occasionally GnRH.|$|E
5|$|If {{not treated}} carefully, {{necrosis}} will spread, causing skin, <b>subcutaneous</b> tissue and muscle {{to separate from}} healthy tissue and eventually slough with serous exudate. The slough may be superficial or deep, sometimes down to the bone. Gangrene and secondary infections commonly occurs and can result in loss of digits and limbs.|$|E
5|$|Numerous etiologies of <b>subcutaneous</b> {{emphysema}} {{have been}} described. Pneumomediastinum was first {{recognized as a}} medical entity by Laennec, who reported it {{as a consequence of}} trauma in 1819. Later, in 1939, at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Dr. Louis Hamman described it in postpartum woman; indeed, <b>subcutaneous</b> emphysema is sometimes known as Hamman's syndrome. However, in some medical circles, it can instead be more commonly known as Macklin's Syndrome after L. Macklin, in 1939, and M.T. and C.C. Macklin, in 1944, who cumulatively went on to describe the pathophysiology in more detail.|$|E
5|$|<b>Subcutaneous</b> {{emphysema}} of {{the chest}} wall is commonly among the first signs to appear that barotrauma, damage caused by excessive pressure, has occurred, {{and it is an}} indication that the lung was subjected to significant barotrauma. Thus the phenomenon may occur in diving injuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of <b>subcutaneous</b> emphysema {{in a person}} who appears quite ill and febrile after bout of vomiting followed by left chest pain is very suggestive of the diagnosis of Boerhaave's syndrome, which is a life-threatening emergency caused by rupture of the distal esophagus.|$|E
5|$|Apomorphine, a non-orally {{administered}} dopamine agonist, {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} off periods and dyskinesia in late PD. It is administered by intermittent injections or continuous <b>subcutaneous</b> infusions. Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are common, individuals receiving apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored. Two dopamine agonists that are administered through skin patches (lisuride and rotigotine) and are useful for people in the initial stages and possibly to control off states in those in the advanced state.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} stages of {{end-of-life}} care, midazolam is routinely used at low doses via <b>subcutaneous</b> injection to help with agitation, myoclonus, restlessness or anxiety in the last hours or days of life. At higher doses during the last weeks of life, midazolam is considered a first line agent in palliative continuous deep sedation therapy when it is necessary to alleviate intolerable suffering not responsive to other treatments, but the need for this is rare.|$|E
5|$|Other bite {{symptoms}} {{that may occur}} in humans include edema, which may become extensive, shock, watery blood oozing from the puncture wounds, nausea and vomiting, <b>subcutaneous</b> bruising, blood blisters that may form rapidly, and a painful swelling of the regional lymph nodes. Swelling usually decreases after a few days, except for the area immediately around the bite site. Hypotension, together with weakness, dizziness and periods of semi- or unconsciousness is also reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{filaments}} {{are preserved}} with {{a gap between}} the bones, which several authors have noted corresponds closely to the expected amount of skin and muscle tissue that would have been present in life. The feathers are closest to the bone on the skull and end of the tail, where little to no muscle was present, and the gap increases over the back vertebrae, where more musculature would be expected, indicating that the filaments were external to the skin and do not correspond with <b>subcutaneous</b> structures.|$|E
5|$|The meat of Highland cattle {{tends to}} be leaner than most beef because Highlands are largely {{insulated}} by their thick, shaggy hair rather than by <b>subcutaneous</b> fat. Highland cattle can produce beef at a reasonable profit from land that would otherwise normally be unsuitable for agriculture. The most profitable way to produce Highland beef is on poor pasture in their native land, the Highlands of Scotland. The meat is also gaining popularity in North America as the beef is low in cholesterol.|$|E
5|$|This {{inflammatory}} cascade typically {{leads to}} the formation of inflammatory acne lesions, including papules, infected pustules, or nodules. If the inflammatory reaction is severe, the follicle can break into the deeper layers of the dermis and <b>subcutaneous</b> tissue and cause the formation of deep nodules. Involvement of AP-1 in the aforementioned inflammatory cascade leads to activation of matrix metalloproteinases, which contribute to local tissue destruction and scar formation.|$|E
5|$|Also bird banding. The {{attachment}} of a small, individually numbered {{metal or}} plastic tag to the leg or wing {{of a wild}} bird to enable individual identification. This helps in {{keeping track of the}} movements of the bird and its life history. Upon capture for ringing, it is common to take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of <b>subcutaneous</b> fat, age indications and sex. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Chest x-ray is {{the initial}} imaging {{technique}} used to diagnose TBI. The film {{may not have}} any signs in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Indications of TBI seen on radiographs include deformity in the trachea or a defect in the tracheal wall. Radiography may also show cervical emphysema, air in the tissues of the neck. X-rays may also show accompanying injuries and signs such as fractures and <b>subcutaneous</b> emphysema. If <b>subcutaneous</b> emphysema occurs and the hyoid bone appears in an X-ray to be sitting unusually high in the throat, {{it may be an}} indication that the trachea has been severed. TBI is also suspected if an endotracheal tube appears in an X-ray to be out of place, or if its cuff appears to be more full than normal or to protrude through a tear in the airway. If a bronchus is torn all the way around, the lung may collapse outward toward the chest wall (rather than inward, as it usually does in pneumothorax) because it loses the attachment to the bronchus which normally holds it toward the center. In a person lying face-up, the lung collapses toward the diaphragm and the back. This sign, described in 1969, is called fallen lung sign and is pathognomonic of TBI (that is, it is diagnostic for TBI because it does not occur in other conditions); however it occurs only rarely. In as many as one in five cases, people with blunt trauma and TBI have no signs of the injury on chest X-ray. CT scanning detects over 90% of TBI resulting from blunt trauma, but neither X-ray nor CT are a replacement for bronchoscopy.|$|E
5|$|Due to this {{extremely}} thin membranous tissue, a bat's wing {{can significantly}} {{contribute to the}} organism's total gas exchange efficiency. Because of the high energy demand of flight, the bat's body meets those demands by exchanging gas through the patagium of the wing. When the bat has its wing in an open/spread out position it allows {{for an increase in}} surface area to volume ratio. The surface area of the wings is about 85% of the total body surface area, suggesting the possibility of a useful amount of gas exchange. The <b>subcutaneous</b> vessels in the membrane very close to the surface allow for the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} stage {{the aim is to}} reduce PD {{symptoms}} while controlling fluctuations in the effect of the medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or overuse have to be managed. When oral medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery, deep brain stimulation, <b>subcutaneous</b> waking day apomorphine infusion and enteral dopa pumps can be of use. The third stage presents many challenging problems requiring a variety of treatments for psychiatric symptoms, orthostatic hypotension, bladder dysfunction, etc. In the final stages of the disease, palliative care is provided to improve quality of life.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} fluid {{replaced}} {{depends on the}} estimated degree of dehydration. If dehydration is so severe as to cause shock (severely decreased blood pressure with insufficient blood supply to the body's organs), or a depressed level of consciousness, rapid infusion of saline (1 liter for adults, 10 ml/kg in repeated doses for children) is recommended to restore circulating volume. Slower rehydration based on calculated water and sodium shortage may be possible if the dehydration is moderate, and again saline is the recommended fluid. Very mild ketoacidosis with no associated vomiting and mild dehydration may be treated with oral rehydration and <b>subcutaneous</b> rather than intravenous insulin under observation for signs of deterioration.|$|E
5|$|The disease-modifying {{treatments}} {{have several}} adverse effects. One {{of the most}} common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with <b>subcutaneous</b> injections and 33% with intramuscular injections). Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes. More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, systolic dysfunction (12%), infertility, and acute myeloid leukemia (0.8%) from mitoxantrone, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring with natalizumab (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated).|$|E
25|$|Intramuscular {{injection}} can {{be complicated}} {{in that the}} depth of <b>subcutaneous</b> fat varies and may result in <b>subcutaneous</b> injection, or may be injected intravenously in error, or the wrong strength used. Intramuscular injection does give a faster and higher pharmacokinetic profile when compared to <b>subcutaneous</b> injection.|$|E
25|$|<b>Subcutaneous</b> (under the skin). This {{generally}} {{takes the}} form of <b>subcutaneous</b> injection, e.g. with insulin. Skin popping is a slang term that includes <b>subcutaneous</b> injection, and is usually used in association with recreational drugs. In addition to injection, it is also possible to slowly infuse fluids subcutaneously in the form of hypodermoclysis.|$|E
25|$|Gender: More {{bruising}} {{occurs in}} females {{due to increased}} <b>subcutaneous</b> fat.|$|E
25|$|Injectable {{dihydrocodeine}} is {{most often}} given as a deep <b>subcutaneous</b> shot.|$|E
25|$|Angiolipomas are painful <b>subcutaneous</b> nodules {{having all}} other {{features}} of a typical lipoma.|$|E
25|$|Specific {{types of}} mastectomy can also include: skin-sparing, nipple-sparing, <b>subcutaneous,</b> and prophylactic.|$|E
25|$|<b>Subcutaneous</b> {{adipose tissue}} regenerates {{cortisol}} from cortisone by the enzyme 11-beta HSD1.|$|E
25|$|Edward Tobinick (M.D. 1977) {{patented}} a use of <b>subcutaneous</b> TNF-α {{to treat}} intractable back pain.|$|E
25|$|The term {{injection}} encompasses intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), <b>subcutaneous</b> (SC) and intradermal (ID) administration.|$|E
25|$|Tumescent anesthesia: a {{large amount}} of very dilute local anesthetics are {{injected}} into the <b>subcutaneous</b> tissues during liposuction.|$|E
