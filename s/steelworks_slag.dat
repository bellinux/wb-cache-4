40|$|International audienceThe "ORLA" {{research}} project {{is attempting to}} evaluate the pathways and limitations of recycling <b>steelworks</b> <b>slag</b> through sequential physical sorting. The objective was to concentrate two distinct fractions; one comprising the iron-bearing slag for intra-steelworks recycling, and the other the calcium- and calc-silicate-bearing slag for cement-plant recycling...|$|E
40|$|A fine natural {{aggregate}} obtained through recovery {{treatment of a}} <b>steelworks</b> <b>slag</b> has been study to assess its use in the asphalt concrete production. Routinely this aggregate is only used, mixed with a (0, 25 – 1 mm) sand to produce asphalt. The process was developed in laboratory scale aiming to transform a waste product into raw material, following the principles of circular economy. The aggregate produced from this recovery has been studied, from a physical-dimensional point of view, to assess its compatibility with the production of asphalt concrete. We compared {{the results of the}} characterization with a {{natural aggregate}} from quarry. Specimens of asphalt concrete have been produced using the two aggregates to evaluate their mechanical characteristics. In particular, we examined the resistance to permanent deformations, associated with degradation and rutting of pavements. The tests were carried out in the laboratory through a Marshall test as well as dynamic creep test. The differences in the volumetric properties of the two asphalt products were also evaluated...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{technical}} feasibility of the utilization of waste from the cutting of granite to adjust the chemical composition of slag from steelworks LD, targeting the addition of clinker Portland cement. For this, chemical characterization of the waste, its mixture and fusion was performed, obtaining a CaO/SiO(2) relationship of around 0. 9 to 1. 2 for the <b>steelworks</b> <b>slag.</b> We selected samples of the waste, mixed, melted and cooled in water and in the oven. Samples cooled in water, after examining with X-ray difractrograms, had been predominantly amorphous. For samples cooled in the furnace, which had vitreous, there was the presence of mineralogical phases Akermanita and Gehlenita, which is considered as the ideal stage for the mineral water activity of the slag. The adjustment of the chemical composition of the slag from steel works {{by the addition of}} waste granite was efficient, transforming the waste into a product that is the same as blast furnace slag and can be used in the manufacture of cement...|$|E
40|$|Municipal {{sewage sludge}} from {{municipal}} {{wastewater treatment plants}} were thermally transformed into powders which were blended with two types of <b>steelworks</b> <b>slags</b> in different proportions. Mixtures of powders, performed by attrition milling, were pressed into specimens which were submitted to thermodilatometric tests in order to evaluate their shrinkage and then their softening temperatures on heating up to 1100 °C. Samples were then sintered in air using a muffle furnace and characterized by density, strength, hardness, fracture toughness measurements, X-Ray diffraction and SEM investigations. The mechanical properties of the sintered specimens are satisfactory {{and this may be}} due to the formation of small grains that, in some cases, are embedded into a vitreous matrix. Samples obtained by the various blends were aged in an acidic (HCl) water solution to evaluate the elution of the components and it was observed that, through the sintering procedure, it is possible to limit the release of many of the most hazardous metals contained in the starting powders...|$|R
50|$|The Glengarnock Ironworks and {{the later}} <b>steelworks</b> {{produced}} <b>slag</b> and other wastes which were disposed of into the loch, significantly reducing {{its size and}} depth. The south-west section of the loch is still hazardous due to slag lying close to the surface. The Dubbs Water was originally dug as a canal in the late 18th century for transporting coal and iron ore to the steelworks and to take finished products to their markets. Roads were unsuitable for transport of heavy goods {{at the time and}} the railways were in their infancy.|$|R
40|$|The {{high costs}} of the quarry crushed {{aggregates}} (producer costs to which additional railroad transport costs are taken into account) result {{in the fact that}} at large distance away from quarry lesser amounts of chippings and crushing sands are provided only. The initiation of the crushed aggregates production manufactured out of <b>steelworks</b> crushed <b>slag.</b> Lidonit, at a competitive delivering price, has led to the first series of laboratory tests. In the first stage two asphalt concrete mixtures were made in cube-shaped and cylinder-shaped (Marshall) test-tubes on which physical and mechanical characteristic values are determined. The results of these first tests outlined the real opportunity of using these products in supplying the roads and streets with asphalt mix for pavements...|$|R
40|$|A {{municipal}} sewage sludge (MSS) {{from a traditional}} wastewater treatment plant and a paper mill sludge (PS) were incinerated and transformed into powders which were blended in different proportions to give powders with different composition. Blendings were performed by attrition milling {{in order to reduce}} the milling time with respect to the traditional wet milling process. Powders were then pressed into specimens which were submitted to thermodilatometric tests to evaluate their shrinkage and their softening temperatures on heating up to 1350 °C. Samples were then air sintered by means of a muffle furnace and characterized by density, strength, hardness, fracture toughness measurements and XRD and SEM investigations. The mechanical properties of the sintered specimens are satisfactory for all compositions and this may be due to the formation of small grains that, in some cases, are surrounded by a vitreous phase. One binary composition (75 % MSS and PS 25 %) showed a strength over 150 MPa. A mixture containing 33 % wt MSS, 33 % wt PS and 33 % wt <b>steelworks</b> <b>slag</b> (SS) was also prepared, processed and characterized like the other blends. All sintered samples were finally aged in an acidic (HCI) water solution to evaluate the elution of the components. It was observed that it is possible to limit the release of many of the most hazardous metals contained in the starting powders by an appropriate sintering schedule...|$|E
40|$|Dredging spoils, due {{to their}} {{composition}} {{could be considered a}} new potential source for the production of monolithic ceramics. Nevertheless, abundance of coloured oxides in these materials preclude the possibility of obtaining white products, but not that of producing ceramics with a good mechanical behaviour. As goal of the present research we have produced and studied samples using not only dredging spoils alone, but also mixtures with other waste materials such as bottom ashes from an incinerator of municipal solid waste, incinerated seawage sludge from a municipal seawage treatment plant and <b>steelworks</b> <b>slag.</b> Blending of different components was done by attrition milling. Powders were pressed into specimens which were air sintered in a muffle furnace and their shrinkage on firing was determined. Water absorption, density, strength, hardness, fracture toughness, thermal expansion coefficient of the fired bodies were measured; XRD and SEM images were also examined. The fired samples were finally tested in acidic environment in order to evaluate their elution behaviour and consequently their environmental compatibility. It is observed that, although the shrinkage on firing is too high for the production of tiles, in all the compositions studied the sintering procedure leads to fine microstructures, good mechanical properties and to a limitation of the release of many of the most hazardous metals contained in the starting powder...|$|E
