50|$|The Spring {{team had}} the {{advantage}} of being able to examine what went wrong with the Mach model and fix it. The result was a much more cleanly separated system of address spaces in programs, mapped by the VM into various memory objects, which were in turn managed by a pager for backing <b>store</b> <b>handling.</b> When a program made a request for data the request was passed to the VM system in the kernel, which would find the appropriate pager and ask it to create and set up an appropriate memory object. In exchange the pager was passed a cache manager from the VM, which was responsible for keeping track of clean/dirty status of the local cache of that memory object. Implementation details added considerable complexity to this model, but most of this was hidden. In the end the basic system had pagers which were in charge of the memory, and address spaces which were in charge of the caches. The two had well-defined interfaces allowing them to pass commands back and forth to keep their data in sync.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. LDApp is {{designed}} as a very modular JavaScript Linked Data stack. A requirement for the modular design was an API to handle the graph data. RDF-Interfaces was the only JavaScript API standard, but lacks <b>store</b> <b>handling</b> and easy management of multiple parsers and serializers. The existing RDF-Interfaces API was extended to cover these use cases. To complete the framework, a JSON-LD integration is desir-able to use JavaScript native language features to deal with graph data. New modules for public interfaces, authentication, authorization, persis-tence and JSON-LD handling have been written to use this API...|$|E

40|$|In retail stores, {{handling}} of products typically forms the largest {{share of the}} operational costs. The handling activities are mainly driven by the shelf stacking process. While {{the impact of the}} handling costs on the profitability of a store is substantial, there are no models available of the different drivers influencing <b>store</b> <b>handling.</b> In this paper, a study of the shelf stacking process is presented. First, a conceptual model based on warehouse operations is derived. It is shown that stacking costs are non-linear with the number of consumer units stacked. Secondly, by means of a motion and time study, data has been collected for dry groceries in four stores of two different European retail companies. Using regression, the developed model clearly demonstrates the impact of the most important drivers for stacking efficiency: case pack (CP) size, number of CPs stacked simultaneously, the filling regime and the working place of the employees. Efficiency gains of 8 - 49 % by changing the driver parameter value are identified. Based on the presented insights both retail companies have already decided to structurally change their current operations.

40|$|The {{problem with}} food waste {{has become more}} and more evident during recent years and a {{reduction}} of the waste would be one important step towards a more sustainable society. The purpose of this comparative study is to examine how some Swedish grocery <b>stores</b> <b>handle</b> their food waste and compare if there are any differences between the three main actors on the Swedish grocery store market; Coop, ICA, and HemkÃ¶p. The study will examine how the grocery <b>stores</b> <b>handle</b> their food waste today, what they do to reduce it and if anything hinders them from taking better care of the waste. Theoretical results indicate an improved infrastructure at the grocery stores can reduce the waste, which involves resources, activities and partners. It also shows an efficient supply chain is important and to reach more efficiency must the chain actors be able to handle uncertainties, collaborate and share information. But to know {{what needs to be done}} is one thing, to make it happen is another and to change old habits and routines can be difficult. Empirical findings demonstrate the grocery stores are very much dependant on their customersâ€™ behaviours and attitudes as well as the efficiency of the whole food supply chain when it comes to food waste reduction.
