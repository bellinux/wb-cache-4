40|$|Ellis (1997) {{describes}} how Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) {{can be distinguished}} from Behavior Therapy (BT) and, perhaps more significantly, “adds” to BT. Among {{the issues raised by}} Ellis is the suggestion that traditional BT may lead only to temporary or <b>superficial</b> <b>behavior</b> changes, and that the goals of BT should be extended to include more comprehensive and enduring “personality change. ” In this commentary, I discuss the underlying medical model adopted by cognitive therapists, the empirical data that bear on the issue of “adding” to BT, and an alternative framework to evaluate clinical practice. It is suggested that there are more similarities among therapists, and their therapies, than differences. Thus, as Charles Ferster (1972) suggested 25 years ago, more effort should be devoted to studying what successful therapists do, and less to arguing the merits of therapists 2 ̆ 7 theoretically informed explanations for success...|$|E

30|$|In any case, one of {{the most}} {{appealing}} features of organizational learning theory for education researchers is the prospect that an organization can in fact grow, evolve, and change in a positive manner, and that these changes can be empirically studied to provide evidence for organizational improvement. When considering this application, it is useful to understand the long-standing debate in the field regarding what constitutes evidence of learning and change. For some theorists, evidence of organizational learning is only apparent by increased performance or observable changes in behavior, whereas others argue that changes resulting from learning may not be visible or immediately evident. For example, Huber ([1991]) argues that ‘an entity learns if, through its processing of information, the range of potential behaviors is changed’ (p. 89). This focus on alterations to the mechanisms that underlay the potentialities of human behavior is similar to Argyris and Schön ([1974]) well-known distinction between single- and double-loop learning. In this view, single-loop learning occurs when an organization changes <b>superficial</b> <b>behaviors</b> or protocols but leaves internal norms and practices intact. In contrast, double-loop learning focuses on the internal mechanisms of the group or organization and involves enacting changes to deeply held traditions, assumptions, and behaviors (Argyris and Schön [1974]). Interestingly, just as an organization may learn by altering entrenched behaviors, an ‘unlearning’ process can be useful when organizations discard old and unproductive information or practices (Nystrom and Starbuck [1984]).|$|R
5000|$|The Superficial {{is notable}} for its biting wit, irreverence towards the celebrities whose lives it chronicles, and liberal {{political}} viewpoint. Unlike other celebrity news {{sites such as}} E! Online and TMZ.com, The <b>Superficial</b> lampoons the <b>behavior</b> of celebrities, to a degree even greater than Perez Hilton. In particular, The Superficial currently focuses {{a disproportionate number of}} items on the drunken misadventures of Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, and Lindsay Lohan, which it has dubbed [...] "The Unholy Trinity," [...] as well as Amy Winehouse and Heidi Montag. The Superficial is also unafraid to make bold statements, such as referring to Heidi Klum and Seal's first son as an [...] "ugly mole creature." [...] The Superficial sometimes posts [...] "Not Suitable For Work" [...] (NSFW) photographs of celebrities, notably Britney Spears and Tara Reid, in various states of public undress.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the induction of the cell behaviors underlying neurulation in the frog,Xenopus laevis. Although planar signals from the organizer can induce convergent extension movements of the posterior neural tissue in explants, the remaining morphogenic processes of neurulation {{do not appear to}} occur in absence of vertical interactions with the organizer (R. Kelleret al., 1992,Dev. Dyn. 193, 218 – 234). These processes include: (1) cell elongation perpendicular to the plane of the epithelium, forming the neural plate; (2) cell wedging, which rolls the neural plate into a trough; (3) intercalation of two layers of neural plate cells to form one layer; and (4) fusion of the neural folds. To allow planar signaling between all the inducing tissues of the involuting marginal zone and the responding prospective ectoderm, we have designed a “giant sandwich” explant. In these explants, cell elongation and wedging are induced in the superficial neural layer by planar signals without persistent vertical interactions with underlying, involuted mesoderm. A neural trough forms, and neural folds form and approach one another. However, the neural folds do not fuse with one another, and the deep cells of these explants do not undergo their normal behaviors of elongation, wedging, and intercalation between the superficial neural cells, even when planar signals are supplemented with vertical signaling until the late midgastrula (stage 11. 5). Vertical interactions with mesoderm during and beyond the late gastrula stage were required for expression of these deep cell behaviors and for neural fold fusion. These explants offer a way to regulate deep and <b>superficial</b> cell <b>behaviors</b> and thus make possible the analysis of the relative roles of these behaviors in closing the neural tube...|$|R

However, the evaluation and characterization of those kinds of adoptions as policy performance distorts the true level of policy performance: social sustainability. This study proposes an affective policy performance evaluation model. The attitudes of employees toward adopting a policy are characterized into genuine and <b>superficial</b> compliance. Their <b>behaviors</b> are explained through voluntary and opportunistic adoptions. In order to validate the proposed model, a survey was conducted on an international trade policy target group (n = 216) for the Strategic Trade Control System (STCS), in order to understand their attitudes toward adopting the policy. The survey data was analyzed by a structural equation modeling method. The measures of the factors in the proposed model are adopted and modified from existing studies. The most effective resources of policy implementation on the firms’ genuine and superficial compliance and ultimately on the firms’ voluntary policy adoption are revealed through the analysis. Based on the results, this study presents a strategy for allocating and managing policy implementation resources to exclusively encourage firms’ trade policy adoptions...|$|R
