40|$|In {{documented}} incidents alone, between January 2006 and December 2009, 900 {{people were}} killed in 534 incidents of group conflict in Turkana. On the basis of this apparent lawlessness, the central research question queries whether the apparent inability of the <b>state</b> <b>law</b> and its institutions to manage group conflicts in Turkana districts denotes a crisis of application or a crisis of substance. Is the problem merely the extension of structures of <b>state</b> <b>law</b> such as courts, prosecutors, security agents, prisons and advocates to Turkana or does the crisis speak to a more fundamental challenge. The research argues the latter, that the relationship between <b>state</b> <b>law</b> and group conflicts in Turkana demands an interrogation of the conceptual and institutional dimensions of modern <b>state</b> <b>law.</b> The thesis interrogates how <b>state</b> <b>law</b> is incorporated; an apparatus of power through which certain regulative rationalities come to reframe the terrain upon which people in Turkana live and define their lives. In order to move <b>state</b> <b>law</b> in a radically improving direction, the research argues for a reorientation of rationalities and legality. The reorientation is advanced through two corresponding techniques that allude to the structural and perspectival elements of <b>state</b> <b>law.</b> Fashioned from amongst the unfinished representations of modernity and the initial task of conceiving a (post) colonial tension between regulation and emancipation, the first task involves building on those progressive aspects of <b>state</b> <b>law</b> that enhance its political legitimacy. The second requires the adoption of a transgressive mode of thinking described as 'knowledge-as-emancipation'. On the basis of these two prescriptions, <b>state</b> <b>law</b> can develop a more purposeful and emancipatory purpose within the conflict context of Turkana in particular, and Kenya in general...|$|R
50|$|Some {{states have}} legalized acts that are {{prohibited}} by federal law.

An act may be legal under <b>state</b> <b>law,</b> {{and at the same time}} illegal under federal <b>law.</b> The <b>states</b> that have legalized marijuana use have not attempted to declare that federal marijuana laws are invalid or unenforceable. Rather, federal marijuana laws still are valid and enforceable, even in states that have made marijuana legal under <b>state</b> <b>law.</b> Thus, these <b>states</b> have not attempted to nullify federal law.|$|R

5000|$|The {{other major}} {{implication}} of the Erie doctrine is that federal courts cannot dictate the content of <b>state</b> <b>law</b> {{when there is no}} federal issue (and thus no federal supremacy issue) in a case.
