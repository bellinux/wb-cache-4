40|$|Co-regulation in {{food safety}} {{represents}} the shared responsibility between food business operators and {{the competent authority}} (CA) to ensure food safety and {{to comply with the}} health requirements of importing countries. The evolution of food regulation on one hand and the quality assurance of the veterinary services of the ONSSA according to the ISO 17020 standard on the other hand, need studying the regulation model adopted at national level. The objective of this work is to analyze the main health risks associated with fishery products from a co-regulatory perspective. The hazards targeted by this study are histamine, parasites and sulfites. The approach is based on structured interviews with fishery products professionals and <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspectors</b> responsible for control and certification. The main hazards are controlled by adopting health control plans (PMS) by the professionals within the establishments as well as the official control carried out by the inspecting veterinarians. The PMS implementation can produce conflicting injunctions for the <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspectors</b> of the competent authority. ...|$|R

40|$|In South East Benin, {{control of}} porcine {{cysticercosis}} {{is carried out}} by using meat inspection. To assess routine inspection method for diagnostic of porcine cysticercosis, two studies were carried out. The study 1 was conducted by using data collected from seizures records from 2006 to 2011. The most important organ condemned was tongue (0. 54 %, 95 % CI: 0. 48 - 0. 60) {{and the most important}} proportion of carcasses seized was 0. 74 %. Prevalence of porcine cysticercosis estimated with meat inspection records was 0. 87 % (95 % CI: 0. 79 - 0. 94). The study 2 was performed on thirty-six pigs and did not revealed porcine cysticercosis by tongue examination. Nevertheless, a case of porcine cysticercosis was observed at meat inspection and 72. 22 % of collected sera were tested positive by Ag-ELISA (26 positive on 36).

Epizootiological investigations were carried out in four quarantine facilities for imported breeding pigs. Epizootiological investigations were conducted also in eight cases of internal sales.

Their work is characterized by intensive and at times adverse contact with inspectees, yet limited interaction with their colleagues. The results show that informal socialization has an important impact on the organizational socialization of inspectors, and provides further insights into the dynamic interplay between formal socialization practices and informal socialization.

40|$|Public professionalism is {{increasingly}} subject to organizational and societal pressures, {{which has led}} to ambiguity concerning its nature. Professionals face conflicting situations due to potential clashes between multifaceted professional, organizational, and societal factors. This raises questions about how these factors affect professional work, how professionals experience conflicts and how they cope. We investigate such conflicts, confusion, and coping strategies in a group of <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspectors.</b> Using semi-structured interviews, we analyse their work and link the resulting insights to different perspectives on professionalism. We show that workers experience conflicts as less stressful when they accept organizational factors, or when they are able to enact a more integrated set of professional/organizational work principles. We call this organizing professionalism. We trace factors that hinder and favour such organizing coping strategies...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{relationship}} between tail lesions, cold carcass weight and viscera condemnations in an Irish abattoir. The following data were collected at the evisceration point from every 3 rd pig slaughtered over 7 days: farm identification, sex, tail lesion score, viscera inspection outcome and cold carcass weight. Tail lesions were scored according to a 5 point scale. Disease lesions responsible for lung (pleurisy, pneumonia and abscess), heart (pericarditis) and liver (ascariasis) condemnation were recorded based on the decision of the <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspector.</b> Data on 3, 143 pigs from 61 batches were available. The relationship between disease lesions, tail lesion score and cold carcass weight was studied at individual carcass level, whereas the relationship between disease lesions and tail lesion score was studied at both carcass and batch level. Tail lesions (score ≥ 1) were found in 72 % of the study population, with 2. 3 % affected by severe tail lesions (scores ≥ 3). Pleurisy (13. 7 %) followed by pneumonia (10. 4 %) showed the highest prevalence, whereas the prevalence of ascariasis showed the greatest variation between batches (0 to 75 %). Tail lesion score, pleurisy, pleuropneumonia and pericarditis were associated with reductions in carcass cold weight (P ≤ 0. 05) ranging from 3 to 6. 6 kg. Tail lesion score was associated with condemnations for pleurisy, pneumonia and pleuropneumonia (P ≤ 0. 05) at a batch level. <b>Veterinary</b> <b>inspector</b> shift was associated with condemnations for pneumonia, pleuropneumonia and pericarditis (P ≤ 0. 05) at a carcass level and with pneumonia at a batch level. Sex was not associated with viscera condemnations but males were more likely to be affected by tail lesions. The relationship between overall tail lesion score and the lung diseases at batch level supports the relationship between poor health and poor welfare of pigs on farms. The inclusion of tail lesion scores at post mortem meat inspection should be considered as a health and welfare diagnostic tool...|$|R

40|$|This article refines Lipsky’s (1980) {{assertion}} that lacking resources negatively affect output performance. It uses fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to analyse the nuanced interplay of contextual and individual determinants of the output performance of <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspectors</b> as street-level bureaucrats in Switzerland. Moving ‘beyond Lipsky’, the study builds on recent theoretical contributions and a systematic comparison across organizational contexts. Against a widespread assumption, output performance {{is not all}} about the resources. The impact of perceived available resources hinges on caseloads, which prove to be more decisive. These contextual factors interact with individual attitudes emerging from diverse public accountabilities. The results contextualize the often-emphasized importance of worker-client interaction. In a setting where clients cannot escape the interaction, street-level bureaucrats are not primarily held accountable by them. Studies of output performance should thus sensibly consider gaps between what is being demanded of and offered to street-level bureaucrats, and the latter’s multiple embeddedness...|$|R
