In 1995, one user told a reporter it is [...] "more potent than cannabis." [...] A 1999 report interviewed a user, who said, [...] "With glue, I just hear voices in my head. But with jenkem, I see visions. I <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> who is dead and I forget about the problems in my life." [...] Fumito Ichinose, an anesthesia specialist in Boston who conducted {{a study on the}} effects of hydrogen sulfide gas, or [...] "sewer gas," [...] on mice, informed Salon.com that holding your breath, choking, or [...] "the inhalation of gases like those produced from jenkem could result in hypoxia, a lack of oxygen flow to the body that could be alternately euphoric and physically dangerous." ...|$|E

6000|$|Sometimes I read to {{my sister}} alone, and she assured me {{that she could not}} <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> among the women this time. This she said to humour me. Presently she would slip upstairs to {{announce}} triumphantly, ‘You are in again!’ ...|$|E
60|$|I did {{not again}} <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> that day, {{nor did she}} sup with us that evening. I was told by Fra Gervasio that on my account was she in retreat, praying for light and {{guidance}} in the thing that must be determined concerning me.|$|E

60|$|I hadn't <b>seen</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{in a year}} or so. And when I {{got there}} she knew my face; knew I was married; knew I had a family, and that I was living with them. But she couldn't, for the life of her, tell my name or who I was. So I told her I was her boy.|$|R
60|$|My {{father had}} once been a {{favourite}} of hers, I believe; but she was mortally affronted by his marriage, on the ground that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was 'a wax doll'. She had never <b>seen</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> but she knew her to be not yet twenty. My father and Miss Betsey never met again. He was double <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> age when he married, and of but a delicate constitution. He died a year afterwards, and, as I have said, six months before I came into the world.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not certain}} but that I could <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> again {{before we went}} up river, {{therefore}} our parting was not as sorrowful {{as it would have}} been had I known all the perils which were to be encountered ere I looked upon her dear face again.|$|E

6000|$|... "In those happy past days, when I {{was still}} dear to my father, {{you said you}} thought of writing to invite a dearly-valued friend to {{pay a visit to}} this house. You had first known him, as I understood, when <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was still living. Many {{interesting}} things you told me about this old friend, but you never mentioned that he knew, or that he had even <b>seen,</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> I was left to suppose that those two had remained strangers to each other to the day of her death.|$|R
60|$|Dim {{pictures}} come to me. I <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> at {{the spinning}} wheel, I help her fill the candle molds.

6000|$|... "That's {{what one}} MUST HAVE, I think," [...] he continued--"the real, real flame of feeling through another person--once, only once, if it only lasts three months. <b>See,</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{looks as if}} she'd HAD {{everything}} that was necessary for her living and developing.

5000|$|My God, that gravy is horrible. They buy {{tap water}} for 15 to 20 cents a {{thousand}} gallons {{and then they}} mix it with flour and starch and end up with pure wallpaper paste.

6000|$|... "Before I go, Mr. Merrick," [...] he said, [...] "I'd {{like you}} to give me <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> picture, {{which is in the}} secret drawer of the cupboard. You have the keys, now, and Ethel is curious to <b>see</b> how <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> looked." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{father was}} a man who was noted for his almost morbid love of truth. He was always pedantically accurate.

6000|$|I was {{now able}} to <b>see</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> again, and the park seats no longer loomed so {{prominent}} in our map of London.
