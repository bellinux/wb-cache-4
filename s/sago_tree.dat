6000|$|We {{were here}} in the great sago {{district}} of East Ceram which supplies most of the surrounding islands with their daily bread, and during our week's delay I had an opportunity of seeing {{the whole process of}} making it, and obtaining some interesting statistics. The <b>sago</b> <b>tree</b> is a palm, thicker and larger than the cocoa-nut tree, although rarely so tall, and having immense pinnate spiny leaves, which completely cover the trunk till it is many years old. It has a creeping root-stem like the Nipa palm, and when about ten or fifteen years of age sends up an immense terminal spike of flowers, after which the tree dies. It grows in swamps, or in swampy hollows on the rocky slopes of hills, where it seems to thrive equally well as when exposed to the influx of salt or brackish water. The midribs of the immense leaves form one of the most useful articles in these lands, supplying the place of bamboo, to which for many purposes they are superior. They are twelve or fifteen feet long, and, when very fine, as thick in the lower part as a man's leg. They are very light, consisting entirely of a firm pith covered with a hard thin rind or bark. Entire houses are built of these; they form admirable roofing-poles for thatch; split and well-supported, they do for flooring; and when chosen of equal size, and pegged together side by side to fill up the panels of framed wooden horses, they have a very neat appearance, and make better walls and partitions than boards, as they do not shrink, require no paint or varnish, and are not a quarter the expense. When carefully split and shaved smooth they are formed into light boards with pegs of the bark itself, and are the foundation of the leaf-covered boxes of Goram. All the insect-boxes I used in the Moluccas were thus made at Amboyna, and when covered with stout paper inside and out, are strong, light, and secure the insect-pins remarkably well. The leaflet of the sago folded and tied {{side by side on the}} smaller midribs form the [...] "atap" [...] or thatch in universal use, while the product of the trunk is the staple food of some= hundred thousands of men.|$|E

60|$|The {{village of}} Teluti is populous, but straggling and very dirty. <b>Sago</b> <b>trees</b> here cover the {{mountain}} side, instead of growing {{as usual in}} low swamps; but a closer examination shows that they grow in swampy patches, which have formed among the loose rocks that cover the ground, and which are kept constantly full of moisture by the rains, and by the abundance of rills which trickle down among them. This sago forms almost the whole subsistence of the inhabitants, who appear to cultivate nothing but a few small patches of maize and sweet potatoes. Hence, as before explained, the scarcity of insects. The Orang-kaya has fine clothes, handsome lamps, and other expensive European goods, yet lives every day on sago and fish as miserably as the rest.|$|R
50|$|Kombai also host parties (although very rarely), {{in which}} they invite people of other tribes, often to repay the other tribes for parties they held, or to clear their names after a Suangi attack on another family or tribe. In these parties the Kombai would feed their guest sago, and grubs from the <b>sago</b> <b>tree,</b> which are a {{delicacy}} to the Kombai. The leader of the family will hang brush from the ceiling of where the party was housed, and if the party was a success, the other tribesmen burn the brush.|$|E
50|$|Papeda is {{made from}} sago starch. The Moluccans and Papuans acquire the starch by felling {{the trunk of a}} sago palm tree, cutting it in half, and {{scraping}} the soft inner parts of the trunk, the pith, producing a crude sago pith flour. This flour is then mixed with water and squeezed to leach the starch from the flour. The still moist sago starch is usually stored in a container made of sago palm leaflets, called tumang in which it will keep for several months before spontaneous fermentation will turn it too acidic and unsuitable for making papeda. Depending on the variety and the growing conditions, it may take a <b>sago</b> <b>tree</b> five to fifteen years to accumulate enough starch in its trunk to make the effort of extracting it worthwhile.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sago</b> <b>tree</b> (Metroxylon rumphii) is a {{potential}} source of starch and an important contributor of non timber forest products for foodstuff reserve {{because it has a}} high carbohydrate content particularly starch. The idea of converting sago starch into dextrin compound is to enhance wider use and increase the economic value of the this commodity. Dextrin has been known for its use as additives in textile industries, pulp/paper industries and pharmaceutical industries. A laboratory trial has been conducted to convert sago into dextrin harnessing the activities of particular enzymes. The aim of this trial was to figure out optimum condition of enzymatic 2 ̆ 7 sago-processing into satisfactory-quality dextrin, able to comply with the requirement of Indonesian National Standard (INS). The target is to obtain appropriate technology development in sago-derived dextrin. The result revealed that the optimum condition was obtained at substrate concentration of 25 percent with enzyme dosage at 0, 9 gram per kg of substrate (dry-weight). In this condition, the dextrin solubility complies with the INS requirement; i. e 25 percent with enzyme dosage at 0, 5 gram per kg of substrate (dry- weight) ...|$|E
40|$|The Mentawai island group, due to {{relative}} remoteness, {{has been}} able to develop independently from activities on the mainland. Therefore, {{a large part of the}} population was raised on the organically developed culture and dynamic capacity of the community. This was possible due to the richly endowed environment, which includes the staple food provision in <b>sago</b> <b>trees</b> and an abundance of wildlife, including boars. The food source became an important element in the traditional believe of Arat Sabulungan, as it served as a binding agent in ritual feasts, bonding of sharing animal protein with clan members, payments to fulfil bride price requirements and traditional fines. In 1954, a compulsory introduction of state sanctioned religions was arranged. As the Mentawains acknowledge certain advanced wisdom and wealth of the sasareu or foreigners, many incentive programs made successful converts. Nevertheless, a remarkable adaptation was included; in which some layers of Mentawai identity was not lost in the conversion. In this adaptation the Islamic faith was infused with local perception.           ...|$|R

60|$|It {{is truly}} an {{extraordinary}} sight {{to witness a}} whole tree-trunk, perhaps twenty feet long and four or five in circumference, converted into food with so little labour and preparation. A good-sized tree will produce thirty tomans or bundles of thirty pounds each, and each toman will make sixty cakes of three to the pound. Two of these cakes are {{as much as a}} man can eat at one meal, and five are considered a full day's allowance; so that, reckoning a tree to produce 1,800 cakes, weighing 600 pounds, it will supply a man with food for a whole year. The labour to produce this is very moderate. Two men will finish a tree in five days, and two women will bake the whole into cakes in five days more; but the raw sago will keep very well, and can be baked as wanted, so that we may estimate that in ten days a man may produce food for the whole year. This is on the supposition that he possesses <b>sago</b> <b>trees</b> of his own, for they are now all private property. If he does not, he has to pay about seven and sixpence for one; and as labour here is five pence a day, the total cost of a year's food for one man is about twelve shillings. The effect of this cheapness of food is decidedly prejudicial, for the inhabitants of the sago countries are never so well off as those where rice is cultivated. Many of the people here have neither vegetables nor fruit, but live almost entirely on sago and a little fish. Having few occupations at home, they wander about on petty trading or fishing expeditions to the neighbouring islands; {{and as far as the}} comforts of life are concerned, are much inferior to the wild hill-Dyaks of Borneo, or to many of the more barbarous tribes of the Archipelago.|$|R

60|$|The {{island of}} Ke (pronounced exactly as the letter K, but erroneously spelt in our maps Key or Ki) {{is long and}} narrow, running in a north and south direction, and {{consists}} almost entirely of rock and mountain. It is everywhere covered with luxuriant forests, and in its bays and inlets the sand is of dazzling whiteness, resulting from the decomposition of the coralline limestone {{of which it is}} entirely composed. In all the little swampy inlets and valleys <b>sago</b> <b>trees</b> abound, and these supply the main subsistence of the natives, who grow no rice, and have scarcely any other cultivated products but cocoa-nuts, plantains, and yams. From the cocoa-nuts, which surround every hut, and which thrive exceedingly on the porous limestone soil and under the influence of salt breezes, oil is made which is sold at a good price to the Aru traders, who all touch here to lay in their stuck of this article, as well as to purchase boats and native crockery. Wooden bowls, pans, and trays are also largely made here, hewn out of solid blocks of wood with knife and adze; and these are carried to all parts of the Moluccas. But the art in which the natives of Ke pre-eminently excel is that of boat building. Their forests supply abundance of fine timber, though, probably not more so than many other islands, and from some unknown causes these remote savages have come to excel in what seems a very difficult art. Their small canoes are beautifully formed, broad and low in the centre, but rising at each end, where they terminate in high-pointed beaks more or less carved, and ornamented with a plume of feathers. They are not hollowed out of a tree, but are regularly built of planks running from ego to end, and so accurately fitted that {{it is often difficult to}} find a place where a knife-blade can be inserted between the joints. The larger ones are from 20 to 30 tons burthen, and are finished ready for sea without a nail or particle of iron being used, and with no other tools than axe, adze, and auger. These vessels are handsome to look at, good sailers, and admirable sea-boats, and will make long voyages with perfect safety, traversing the whole Archipelago from New Guinea to Singapore in seas which, as every one who has sailed much in them can testify, are not so smooth and tempest-free as word-painting travellers love to represent them.|$|R
60|$|We {{passed an}} anxious night, fearful of again {{breaking}} our anchor or rattan cable. In the morning (23d), finding all secure, I waded on shore with my two men, leaving the old steersman and the cook on board, with a loaded musketto recall us if needed. We first {{walked along the}} beach, till stopped by the vertical cliffs at {{the east end of}} the island, finding a place where meat had been smoked, a turtle-shell still greasy, and some cut wood, the leaves of which were still green, showing that some boat had been here very recently. We then entered the jungle, cutting our way {{up to the top of}} the hill, but when we got there could see nothing, owing to the thickness of the forest. Returning, we cut some bamboos, and sharpened them to dig for water in a low spot where some sago-trees were growing; when, just as we were going to begin, Hoi, the Wahai man, called out to say he had found water. It was a deep hole among the <b>Sago</b> <b>trees,</b> in stiff black clay, full of water, which was fresh, but smelt horribly from the quantity of dead leaves and sago refuse that had fallen in. Hastily concluding that it was a spring, or that the water had filtered in, we baled it all out as well as a dozen or twenty buckets of mud and rubbish, hoping by night to have a good supply of clean water. I then went on board to breakfast, leaving my two men to make a bamboo raft to carry us on shore and back without wading. I had scarcely finished when our cable broke, and we bumped against the rocks. Luckily it was smooth and calm, and no damage was done. We searched for and got up our anchor, and found teat the cable had been cut by grating all night upon the coral. Had it given way in the night, we might have drifted out to sea without our anchor, or been seriously damaged. In the evening we went to fetch water from the well, when, greatly to our dismay, we found nothing but a little liquid mud at the bottom, and it then became evident that the hole was one which had been made to collect rain water, and would never fill again as long as the present drought continued. As we did not know what we might suffer for want of water, we filled our jar with this muddy stuff so that it might settle. In the afternoon I crossed over to the other side of the island, and made a large fire, in order that our men might see we were still there.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the third}} report of of a {{longitudinal}} survey of neuro-degenerative diseases, walking in swampy jungle of West New Guinea. When we visited small city of Agats, where about five thousand people of the Asmat tribe lived, we found very few patients with neuro-degenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Parkinson disease. City of Agats lies a few hundred kilometers northwest to the main district of Mappi, where many patients with neuro-degenerative diseases have been found by our survey. When we had dinner in a hotel in Agats, we barely managed to eat the Sago worm which lived in a <b>Sago</b> palm <b>tree.</b> A female doctor from a big city of Indonesia {{said that she had}} never eaten those ugly worms and that it is another culture in her country. In the old days of coastal swampy jungle of West New Guinea, Sago was once the staple food among many tribes of Papua. But monetary economy has changed their self-sufficient living of life, and people now need money to get rice from outlander merchants. A young man has been suffering from retrobulbar optic neuritis, and became blind. He worked in a palm oil factory to get money only to take to drinking methyl-alcohol. A French film named "Cybèle ou les Dimanches de Ville d'Avray" was awarded the American Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1962. The heroine of the film confided that her true name is Cybèle, very old name in ancient times. In the cinema, I wondered how old it could be. Thirty years later when I visited Turkey, I found that Cybèle was a Greek goddess of the earth, a Gaea or Gaia. But I found also that the big plaster figure in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara was named as the Goddess of the Earth. This figure was thought to be built 8, 000 years ago. Nowadays modern Turkish people regard Cybèle as the same goddess of the earth. So the name of Cybèle might be traced as old as in the New Stone Age. Papuan people lived the Stone Age living until quite recently. And Asmat people make wood carvings resembling the Anatolian figure, and I wonder if they once called them Cybèle before the era of monetary economy...|$|R
