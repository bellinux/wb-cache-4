25|$|Smith {{initially}} {{had some}} difficulty sourcing suitable engines for the ship, as <b>screw</b> <b>propulsion</b> presented some unfamiliar technical challenges. Eventually the leading engineering firm of J. and G.

50|$|SS Austria was a {{steamship}} of the Hamburg America Line which sank on 13 September 1858, {{in one of}} {{the worst}} transatlantic maritime disasters of the nineteenth century, claiming the lives of 449 passengers and crew. The Austria was built by Caird & Co. of Greenock, Scotland and was launched on 23 June 1857. She was 318 ft and 2,684 BRT, with three masts and single <b>screw</b> propeller <b>propulsion.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The T-19 was {{provided}} with floatation equipment powered using pneumatic or [...] "skeleton" [...] floats, whose discharge could be produced without {{the output of}} crew from the machine. For the production were accepted the floating crafts of naval engineer B.S. Smirnov's system. There was initially the desire to equip tank with two detachable <b>screws</b> for <b>propulsion</b> through the water, but the T -19 was instead equipped with a special “water tractor”, which was created in 1931.|$|R
25|$|Archimedes had {{considerable}} influence on ship development, encouraging {{the adoption of}} <b>screw</b> <b>propulsion</b> by the Royal Navy, {{in addition to her}} influence on commercial vessels. She also had a direct influence on the design of another innovative vessel, Isambard Kingdom Brunel's , then the world's largest ship and the first screw-propelled steamship to cross the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} {{figure in}} the company {{for most of its}} existence was Jacob G. Neafie. Born in New Jersey on Christmas Day 1815, Neafie served his apprenticeship as a machinist in New York before joining the Philadelphian shipbuilding firm of Thomas Holloway in 1832, where he gained experience in shipbuilding and reportedly took an interest in the new technology of <b>screw</b> <b>propulsion.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1835, two inventors in Britain, John Ericsson and Francis Pettit Smith, {{began working}} {{separately}} on the problem. Smith, a farmer by trade who had entertained a lifelong fascination with <b>screw</b> <b>propulsion,</b> {{was first to}} take out a screw propeller patent on 31 May, while Ericsson, a gifted Swedish engineer then working in Britain, filed his patent six weeks later.|$|E

50|$|An inboard motor is {{a marine}} {{propulsion}} system for boats. As {{opposed to an}} outboard motor where an engine is mounted outside the hull of the craft, an inboard motor is an engine enclosed within the hull of the boat, usually connected to a <b>propulsion</b> <b>screw</b> by a driveshaft.|$|R
5000|$|The Volkswagen Schwimmwagen {{incorporated}} a boat-like body and <b>propulsion</b> <b>screw.</b> The Jeep was similarly adapted as the Ford GPA [...] "Seep", but was never {{as successful as}} the Schwimmwagen which became the most mass-produced amphibious car in history, and arguably the most capable light military wheeled off-roader in World War II.|$|R
25|$|The {{principle}} of moving {{water with a}} screw has been known since {{the invention of the}} Archimedes' screw, named after Archimedes of Syracuse who lived in the 3rd Century BC. It was not until the 18th century however, and the invention of the steam engine, that a practical means of delivering effective power to a marine <b>screw</b> <b>propulsion</b> system became available, but initial attempts to build such a vessel met with failure.|$|E
25|$|In September 1871, she sailed from Havre to Tyneside in Northern England {{where she}} was {{lengthened}} to 421.7ft by A. Leslie and Company, Hebburn-on-Tyne and her tonnage increased to 5,065 tons. She was also fitted with compound steam engines and rebuilt with single <b>screw</b> <b>propulsion,</b> and the paddle wheels were removed. A third mast was also fitted and after completion of the works she was renamed Ville du Havre. Following sea trials, she recommenced her Havre – Brest – New York service in early 1873.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{adoption}} of the screw propeller was an historical inevitability given the work of John Ericsson and others, Archimedes considerably hastened acceptance of the technology. The Dover trials, carried out in April–May 1840, persuaded the Royal Navy to build a 900-ton steam sloop-of-war, , which was trialled from 1843-45 against HMS Alecto, a sister ship fitted with paddle propulsion. As a result of these trials, the Navy adopted the screw propeller as its preferred propulsion method. By 1855, 174 ships of the Royal Navy had been fitted with <b>screw</b> <b>propulsion,</b> including 52 ships-of-the-line, 23 frigates, 17 corvettes, 55 sloops, and various other vessels.|$|E
40|$|Marine {{propulsion}} {{plants can}} experience large power fluctuations during tight maneuvers, with increases of shaft torque {{up to and}} over 100 % of the steady values in straight course and considerable asymmetry between internal and external shafts during turning circle. This phenomenon (studied in Viviani et al 2007 a and 2007 b), can be of particular interest for twin <b>screw</b> ships <b>propulsion</b> systems with coupled shaftlines, in which asymmetrical loads can represent a challenge for the whole propulsion system (e. g. unique reduction gear, shaftlines, automation). A joint research {{has been set up}} in order to deeply investigate the phenomenon, by means of large scale model testing and related numerical simulations. In the present work, preliminary simulation results with different simplified automation systems and with an automation system more similar to the real one are reported, allowing to get a better insight into this complex problem...|$|R
5000|$|SS California was [...] (6,791 {{under deck}} and 5,403 net), with {{a length of}} 470 ft, a beam of 58.3 ft and a draught of 34 ft. The California had three decks: the poop deck was 70 ft long, the bridge 213 ft long and the {{forecastle}} 91 ft long. She had two black funnels, two giant masts (one fore and one aft), twin <b>screw</b> propeller <b>propulsion</b> and was capable of achieving a speed of 16 kn. She was fitted with a triple expansion engine with 6 cylinders of 27, 46 and 75 inches each pair; it had a stroke of 54 inches and produced 827 nominal horsepower. The engine was built by the same company that built her hull. The ship was capable of carrying a total of 1214 passengers: 232 first class, 248 second class and 734 third class. She was outfitted with the latest appointments, including electric light and refrigerating machinery.|$|R
50|$|Fabian Wrede class {{ships are}} built with steel hull and {{aluminium}} superstructure. One 500 kW CAT C 18 engine driving a single <b>screw</b> provides the <b>propulsion</b> for the vessels, {{with a bow}} thruster provided for increased maneuverability. An auxiliary 38 kVA diesel generator is also carried. The ships are manned with a maximum of eight seaman students and four instructors and crew members. Intended as purpose-built training ships, the internal layout and equipment of the bridge is designed similar to larger warships. The engine room is built spacious enough for several students and the mess {{can be converted to}} a class room.|$|R
25|$|Though Smith's Archimedes {{had played}} an {{important}} role in the introduction of <b>screw</b> <b>propulsion,</b> Smith himself only lost money on the venture, and was forced to return to farming. He would later be recognized for his contribution however. In 1855, he was amongst five inventors awarded £4,000 each by the House of Commons for invention of the marine propeller. In 1858, a group of patrons arranged a testimonial dinner at which he was presented with a silver salver, claret-jug and subscription, with an aggregate value of £2,678. In 1860, Smith was appointed Curator of the Patent Office Museum in South Kensington, and in 1871 he received a knighthood.|$|E
25|$|Precisely {{when the}} Chaplin Distiller was {{installed}} on Xantho {{is open to}} conjecture. It is known that from 1864 to 1870, Xantho operated out of Wick, West Sussex and was permitted to take excursions to sea. It is possible that this apparatus was installed {{during this period of}} time. It is more feasible however that this device was installed at a later date as part of the major refurbishing programme implemented by the metal merchant Robert Stewart, who, in 1871, completely and radically re-engineered the ship, replacing the original side paddlewheel steam propulsion with a new marine fire tube boiler and <b>screw</b> <b>propulsion,</b> utilising a secondhand Horizontal Trunk Engine designed by John Penn and Son.|$|E
25|$|Roach {{had founded}} the Delaware {{shipyard}} {{in anticipation of}} a boom in iron shipbuilding in the United States. He was soon to discover that he had seriously underestimated the conservatism of American shipping lines, most of whom were content to continue ordering the familiar wooden-hulled paddle steamers in spite of the proven advantages of iron hulls and <b>screw</b> <b>propulsion.</b> In order to attract more business, Roach tried reducing the entry cost of purchase by offering to buy shares in the ships he sold, taking a corresponding ratio of their future earnings as part payment for their construction. In this way he found himself gradually accumulating substantial interests {{in a number of different}} shipping lines.|$|E
50|$|These {{warships}} {{more closely}} resembled the traditional sailing warship, and were built with steam engines and <b>screw</b> propeller for <b>propulsion.</b> The ships retained a full sail-plan however, due less to conservatism than {{to lack of}} coaling supplies around the globe, the last being an especially important consideration for frigates, which often operated independently {{on the far side}} of the world. These 'screw frigates', built first of wood and later of iron, continued to perform the traditional role of the frigate until late in the 19th century. France and the United Kingdom were the only two countries to develop fleets of wooden steam screw battleships, and both navies built numbers of screw frigates.|$|R
40|$|During ship design, {{its service}} speed {{is one of}} the crucial {{parameters}} which decide on future economic effects. As sufficiently exact calculation methods applicable to preliminary design stage are lacking the so called contract speed which a ship reaches in calm water is usually applied. In the paper [11] a parametric method for calculation of total ship resistance in actual weather conditions (wind, waves, sea current), was presented. This paper presents a parametric model of ship <b>propulsion</b> system (<b>screw</b> propeller - <b>propulsion</b> engine) as well as a calculation method, based on both models, of mean statistical value of ship service speed in seasonal weather conditions occurring on shipping lines. The method makes use of only basic design parameters and may be applied in preliminary design stage...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the special}} {{performances}} obtained {{by means of the}} optimisation method applied to the axial runners of run-of-river hydraulic turbines and of wind turbines, {{as well as in the}} case of the <b>screws</b> for boat <b>propulsion,</b> perfected by the first of the authors [1] - [10], in this work one extend the application of this method at the case of an organic mud agitator screw for fermentation and biogas production. One presents the obtaining of the bio liquid circulation minimal velocity in the two possible cases [3]: extracting the fluid velocity from the peripheral force exerted by the runner, as well as from the mechanical power consumed for its driving. After the obtaining of the optimal relative peripheral angle one determines also the optimal incidence angles of the profile for other blade radii. This method permits in the same time to find the optimal profile, using the multitude of the profile characteristics, experimentally studied...|$|R
25|$|Some merchants {{were also}} quick to adopt <b>screw</b> <b>propulsion.</b> In 1840, Wimshurst built a second propeller-driven vessel, the 300-ton Novelty, the first screw-propelled cargo ship {{and the first}} to make a {{commercial}} voyage. In 1841, a small passenger steamer fitted with Smith's patented propeller, Princess Royal, was built in the north of England, and in 1842, several more screw-propelled vessels were built or launched in Britain, including Bedlington, built at South Shields, Bee, launched at Chatham, and the largest ship built to that date in Ireland, Great Northern, launched at Derry. From this point, screw-propelled merchant ships grew rapidly in number. By the time the Cunard Line built the paddle steamer Persia for transatlantic service in 1856, the paddlewheel was already becoming an anachronism.|$|E

50|$|On Saturday 27 May 1899 Fenella was tasked {{to operate}} a sailing between Peel and Liverpool to {{transport}} troops of the 8th Lancashire Artillery Volunteers (TA), for their return from a summer camp. Departing at 11:00hrs, the Fenella was passing {{to the south of}} the Calf of Man, when a bracket on one of her propeller shafts broke, and she was consequently left with only one of her two <b>screws</b> available for <b>propulsion.</b> This would have meant arriving at Liverpool approximately 3hrs behind schedule.Capt. Faragher therefore, decided to divert the Fenella to Douglas so as the soldiers could be transferred to another vessel. Unfortuntaley, the Tynwald had already departed Douglas, when the partly disabled Fenella arrived off Douglas Head. The Fenella managed to attract the Tynwald's attention, by sounding her whistle and running various flag signals from her masts. Consequently, the Tynwald returned to Douglas, whereupon the soldiers were transferred, and the Tynwald departed for Liverpool.|$|R
5000|$|The first American {{military}} submarine was Turtle in 1776, a hand-powered egg-shaped (or acorn-shaped) device {{designed by}} the American David Bushnell, to accommodate a single man. It was the first submarine capable of independent underwater operation and movement, {{and the first to}} use <b>screws</b> for <b>propulsion.</b> However, according to British naval historian Richard Compton-Hall, the problems of achieving neutral buoyancy would have rendered the vertical propeller of the Turtle useless. The route the Turtle must take to attack its intended target HMS Eagle was slightly across the tidal stream which would, in all probability, have resulted in Ezra Lee becoming exhausted. There are also no British records of an attack by a submarine during the war. In the face of these and other problems, Compton-Hall suggests that the entire story around the Turtle was fabricated as disinformation and morale-boosting propaganda, and that if Ezra Lee did carry out an attack, it was in a covered rowing boat rather than the Turtle. Replicas of Turtle have been built to test the design. One replica (Acorn), created by Duke Riley and Jesse Bushnell (claiming to be a descendant of David Bushnell), used the tide to get within 200 feet of the RMS Queen Mary 2 in New York City (Acorn was stopped by a police boat for violating a security zone).Replicas of Turtle's [...] acknowledging its place in history are on display at the Connecticut River Museum, the U.S. Navy's Submarine Force Library and Museum, Britain's Royal Navy Submarine Museum and Monaco's Oceanographic Museum.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{considers}} {{the requirements for}} sta-ble control of simple devices that consist of a permanent magnet rigidly attached to a screw operating in soft tissue. Placing these devices in a rotating magnetic field causes the device’s permanent magnet to rotate synchronously with the applied field, making the attached <b>screw</b> generate forward <b>propulsion.</b> Although there has been significant {{research in the area}} of magnetic screws, this paper describes magnetic phenomena that have not been addressed in prior work, yet will be critical in the design of future steering and control strategies for medical applications. Using a time-averaged model of magnetic torque, we analyze the magnetic torque present when intentionally steering the screw or due to naturally occurring disturbances in the screw’s heading. We predict and experimentally demonstrate the existence of magnetic torques that simultaneously act to stabilize and destabilize magnetic screws operating in tissue. We find that there exists an applied field rotation speed, above which screws may become unstable, and we find that the interaction between the stabilizing and destabilizing magnetic torques may cause potentially undesired but predictable behavior while steering.
