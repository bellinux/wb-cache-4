25|$|Hollypaw and a {{few other}} cats go on a border patrol to the WindClan border because they scented WindClan on their territory, and find dead fresh-kill with WindClan scent on it. The next day, Hollypaw, Lionpaw, and a patrol go to the WindClan border for a second time. There, Hollypaw scents {{something}} in the bushes, which turns {{out to be one of}} the tunnels the leads to the river, the same one from Dark River. She doesn't tell the rest of the patrol, but Lionpaw goes back to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jean-Paul Borderie, the {{co-pilot}} {{was looking}} forward to spending Christmas with his family at their vineyard in Bordeaux. Zahida Kakachi was going to experience a Parisian Christmas; She had wanted to go to Midnight Mass to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like. Christophe Morin was especially anxious to get home. A few months before (over the summer), his brother and sister had both died, so Morin had asked Air France if it was possible for him not to fly during the actual Christmas celebrations, but they had refused his request... so he went to work on the flight feeling very reluctant, because he had wanted to be with his parents and family.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, Canada was {{importing}} 90% of its {{oil from}} the U.S. The situation changed dramatically in 1947 when, after drilling 133 consecutive dry holes, Imperial Oil decided to drill into a peculiar anomaly on its newly developed seismic recordings near the then-village of Leduc to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> The Leduc No. 1 well identified a large oil field, and provided the geological key for other important discoveries within Alberta. Geologists soon began to identify and drill other Devonian reefs within the province - mostly in the north-central portion of the province. The Alberta oil rush began, and drillers quickly began to identify other important oil-bearing formations like the one hosting the giant Pembina oilfield.|$|E

500|$|In an {{apparently}} non-political case of imitation of Quảng Đức, the young {{son of an}} American officer based at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon doused himself with gasoline and set himself on fire.

500|$|Ruby Messer Barber {{had this}} to say about joining the WAVES, [...] "It was a choice of adventure. I didn't have any brothers, and I thought that's {{something}} I can do, one way I can make a contribution. My sisters thought it was great, but they were not interested. There was too much discipline and routine involved. I felt like it would be a challenge, to step forth and do it, to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all about. It gave a sense of confidence. At the time girls just didn't join the WAVES or go into the military. But my Dad, he said, you'll be OK".|$|E

500|$|From Lisbon the Imperial couple {{went on to}} Porto. Isabel and {{her family}} {{departed}} to Spain on a trip. On 24 December, the Imperial Family received official news {{that they had been}} banished forever from the country. Up until that point, they had only been requested to leave with no indication as to how long they were to stay away. The [...] "news broke D. Teresa Cristina's will to live." [...] PedroII wrote in his journal on 28 December 1889: [...] "Hearing the Empress complain I went to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> She is cold with a pain in her sides; but she does not have any fever." [...] As the day passed, Teresa Cristina's breathing became increasingly labored, and the failure of her respiratory system led to cardiac arrest and death at 2:00pm.|$|E

2500|$|Raga was {{released}} on home video in 1991, distributed by Mystic Fire Video. The Shankar-affiliated East Meets West Music (EMWMusic) remastered the film and released it on DVD in October 2010, with the new title Raga: A Film Journey into the Soul of India. The release was part of EMWMusic's celebrations for Shankar's 90th birthday. Shankar said of his reasons for reissuing the film: [...] "It was a very special period of my life. I really want today's generation to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like {{for me to be}} in such a unique and exciting position – {{to be the first to}} bridge the gap between the East and the West and to devise a new way to attract, educate, initiate and draw those in the West to the exceptional world of Indian classical music and culture." ...|$|E

2500|$|His Life of the Fathers {{comprises}} twenty hagiographies of {{the most}} prominent men of the preceding generation, taking in a wide range the spiritual community of early medieval Gaul, including lives of bishops, clerics, monks, abbots, holy men and hermits. St. Illidius is praised for his purity of heart, St. Brachio the abbot for his discipline and determination in study of the scriptures, St Patroclus for his unwavering faith in the face of weakness, and St. Nicetius, bishop of Lyon, for his justice. It is the life of St. Nicetius of Trier, though, which dominates this book; his great authority and sense of episcopal responsibility [...] which is the focus of Gregory's account as his figure, predestined to be great, bestrides the lives of the others. It is told that he felt a weight on his head, but he was unable to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> when turning around, though upon smelling its sweet scent he realised that it was the weight of episcopal responsibility. (Life of the Fathers, XVII, 1) He surmounts the others in the glory of his miracles, and was chosen by God to have the entire succession of past and future Frankish kings revealed to him.|$|E

60|$|Augusta {{took the}} document, and having looked to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> shivered {{as she did}} so. It brought the whole thing back so painfully to her mind.|$|E

60|$|Richard readily consented. He {{had often}} heard his father {{speak of the}} street--how {{beautiful}} {{it had been years}} ago, and how trade had taken hold of it, and the boy was curious to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like.|$|E
60|$|But I {{was very}} much too curious to excuse him so easily. I shifted my ground swiftly to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that he was after. He was {{standing}} outside, and waving his hand frantically, as in a signal.|$|E
60|$|He was {{a kindly}} goodly man, and {{naturally}} prone, Instead of taking others' gold, {{to give away}} his own. But he had heard of Vice, and longed for only once to strike - To plan ONE little wickedness--to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like.|$|E
