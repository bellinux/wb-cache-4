5|$|Outside Mars, Jupiter {{was first}} visited by Pioneer 10 in 1973. More than 20 years later Galileo sent a probe into the planet's atmosphere, {{and became the}} first <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> orbit the planet. Pioneer 11 became the first <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> visit Saturn in 1979, with Voyager 2 making the first (and so far only) visits to Uranus and Neptune in 1986 and 1989, respectively. The first <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> leave the solar system was Pioneer 10 in 1983. For a time it was the most distant spacecraft, but it has since been surpassed by both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.|$|E
5|$|Several Gemini Ferry {{spacecraft}} were {{proposed to}} provide transportation of crews and cargo to NASA and USAF space stations in low Earth orbit. NASA contracted McDonnell {{to conduct a}} study into what modifications {{would be needed to}} allow the Gemini <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> support this. Three spacecraft were envisioned; a manned <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> transport crew to the stations, a manned spacecraft with a cargo module for both crew and cargo delivery, and a dedicated unmanned <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> resupply the station every three or four months.|$|E
5|$|Its first {{extended}} {{visit was}} to do a flyby of Comet Boethin, but with some complications. On July 21, 2005 Deep Impact executed a trajectory correction maneuver that allows the <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> use Earth's gravity to begin a new mission in a path towards another comet.|$|E

5|$|On 28 February {{the third}} Progress <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> visit the ISS, Progress M-44, docked to the Zvezda module. It brought air, food, rocket fuel and other equipment. It {{remained}} docked until Expedition 2, {{when it was}} intentionally burnt up during atmospheric reentry, like all Progress spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 2006, {{the first}} <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> explore the Kuiper belt, New Horizons, was launched, which flew by Pluto on July 14, 2015. Beyond the Pluto flyby, the mission's {{goal was to}} locate and {{investigate}} other, farther objects in the Kuiper belt.|$|E
5|$|The Shuttle–Mir Program was a {{collaborative}} space program between Russia and the United States, which involved American Space Shuttles visiting the Russian space station Mir, Russian cosmonauts flying on the shuttle, and an American astronaut flying aboard a Soyuz <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> engage in long-duration expeditions aboard Mir.|$|E

5|$|Voyager 1 {{became the}} first <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> cross the {{heliopause}} in August 2012, then {{at a distance of}} 121 AU from the Sun, although this was not confirmed for another year.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, it was {{announced}} that Voyager 1 might have become the first <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> enter interstellar space, having detected a marked change in the plasma environment on August 25, 2012. However, until September 12, 2013, it was still an open question as to whether the new region was interstellar space or an unknown region of the Solar System. At that time, the former alternative was officially confirmed.|$|E

5|$|On March 6, 2015, the Dawn {{spacecraft}} {{began to}} orbit Ceres, {{becoming the first}} <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> orbit a dwarf planet. On July 14, 2015, the New Horizons space probe flew by Pluto and its five moons. Dawn has also explored the former dwarf planet Vesta. Phoebe has been explored by Cassini (most recently) and Voyager 2, which also explored Triton. These three {{are thought to be}} former dwarf planets and therefore their exploration helps {{in the study of the}} evolution of dwarf planets.|$|E
5|$|Salyut 6's {{propulsion}} system experienced a serious malfunction {{during the second}} crew residency in 1978 and was not usable again {{for the remainder of}} the station's lifespan. As a consequence, it was limited to firing its attitude control thrusters and visiting spacecraft had to perform orbital adjustments. After each crew residency ended, it was necessary for Progress and TKS <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> boost the station into a high orbit so it wouldn't decay until the next residency began.|$|E
5|$|The United States Air Force {{intended}} to use the Gemini <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> transport astronauts to its proposed space stations, the Manned Orbital Development System and later the Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL). These stations would have been launched by Titan IIIM rockets, with a Gemini spacecraft atop, {{eliminating the need for}} rendezvous and docking maneuvers. For this purpose, several modifications were made to the Gemini capsule, including the installation of a hatch in the heat shield to allow access to the space station.|$|E

5|$|The first <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> {{perform a}} {{successful}} lunar soft landing was Luna 9 {{and the first}} unstaffed vehicle to orbit the Moon was Luna 10, both in 1966. Rock and soil samples were brought back to Earth by three Luna sample return missions (Luna 16 in 1970, Luna 20 in 1972, and Luna 24 in 1976), which returned 0.3kg total. Two pioneering robotic rovers landed on the Moon in 1970 and 1973 {{as a part of}} Soviet Lunokhod programme.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> reach escape {{velocity}} was the Soviet Luna 1, which performed a fly-by of the Moon in 1959. In 1961, Venera 1 {{became the first}} planetary probe. It revealed {{the presence of the}} solar wind and performed the first fly-by of the planet Venus, although contact was lost before reaching Venus. The first successful planetary mission was the Mariner 2 fly-by of Venus in 1962. The first <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> perform a fly-by of Mars was Mariner 4, which reached the planet in 1964. Since that time, unmanned spacecraft have successfully examined each of the Solar System's planets, as well their moons and many minor planets and comets. They remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space, as well as observation of the Earth. In August 2012, Voyager 1 became the first man-made object to leave the Solar System and enter interstellar space.|$|E
5|$|A {{range of}} {{applications}} were considered for Advanced Gemini missions, including military flights, space station crew and logistics delivery, and lunar flights. The Lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems {{developed for the}} Agena target vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the Centaur, which could propel the <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> the Moon, to complete modifications of the Gemini to enable it {{to land on the}} Lunar surface. Its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before Apollo was ready, to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded Apollo crews, or even replacing the Apollo program.|$|E

5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may choose}} to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons. While probes may {{take a long time}} to reach the Solar System, once there they would be able to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away. Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the only option other than to send large, crewed <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} mission {{would have}} seen a Gemini spacecraft rendezvous with a Pegasus satellite in low Earth orbit. The spacecraft would have either been launched directly into an orbit to rendezvous with the Pegasus, or into a lower orbit, subsequently docking with an Agena, and using that to raise its orbit. The Gemini would have flown around the Pegasus, {{and then one of}} the crew would have performed an EVA to recover a piece of one of the spacecraft's micrometeoroid detection panels. This mission would have been used to prove that rendezvous could be accomplished with any <b>spacecraft,</b> <b>to</b> collect data on the satellite's exposure to micrometeoroids — supporting data that the satellite had returned itself, and to demonstrate technology for military flights to inspect hostile satellites.|$|E
5|$|Apollo set major {{milestones}} {{in human}} spaceflight. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit, and landing humans on another celestial body. Apollo 8 {{was the first}} manned <b>spacecraft</b> <b>to</b> orbit another celestial body, while Apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond low Earth orbit to date. The program spurred advances {{in many areas of}} technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers. Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks. Many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums.|$|E
