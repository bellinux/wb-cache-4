5|$|Greenland ice cores show {{evidence}} of a large volcanic eruption in 1642±5BCE, which was suggested as being associated with <b>Santorini.</b> However, volcanic ash retrieved from an ice core does not match the expected <b>Santorini</b> fingerprint. The late Holocene eruption of the Mount Aniakchak, a volcano in Alaska, is now {{believed to be the}} source of the minute shards of volcanic glass in the Greenland ice core.|$|E
5|$|The Minoan {{eruption}} of Thera, {{also referred to}} as the Thera eruption or <b>Santorini</b> eruption, was a major catastrophic volcanic eruption with a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 6 or 7 and a dense-rock equivalent (DRE) of , Dated to the mid-second millennium BCE, the eruption was one of the largest volcanic events on Earth in recorded history. It devastated the island of Thera (now called <b>Santorini),</b> including the Minoan settlement at Akrotiri and communities and agricultural areas on nearby islands and the coast of Crete with a related earthquake and tsunami.|$|E
5|$|There is some archaeological, seismological and vulcanological {{evidence}} that the myth of Atlantis, described by Plato, {{is based upon the}} <b>Santorini</b> eruption.|$|E
50|$|The Greek {{government}} conducted {{their own}} investigation, with their leading scientist, physicist Dr. Paul <b>Santorinis,</b> in charge. <b>Santorinis</b> {{had been a}} developer of the proximity fuze on the first A-bomb and held patents on guidance systems for Nike missiles and radar systems. <b>Santorinis</b> was supplied by the Greek Army {{with a team of}} engineers to investigate what again were believed to be Russian missiles flying over Greece.|$|R

5|$|Elsewhere in the Mediterranean are pumice {{deposits}} {{that could}} have been caused by the Thera eruption. Ash layers in cores drilled from the seabed and from lakes in Turkey, however, show that the heaviest ashfall was towards the east and northeast of <b>Santorini.</b> The ash found on Crete is now known to have been from a precursory phase of the eruption, some weeks or months before the main eruptive phases, and it would have had little impact on the island. <b>Santorini</b> ash deposits were at one time claimed to have been found in the Nile delta, but this is now known to be a misidentification.|$|E
5|$|Activity of Cerro Blanco {{goes back}} 8 mya, when the Maricunga Belt {{in the west}} was active. The volcano is {{responsible}} for a large Holocene eruption with a Volcano explosivity index 7, {{the largest in the}} Andean Central Volcanic Zone for 5000 years. It is comparable to <b>Santorini</b> and Tambora's large eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Geologist Barbara J.

5|$|Volcanic eruptions eject {{large amounts}} of carbon into the air. The carbon is of {{geological}} origin and has no detectable , so the / ratio {{in the vicinity of}} the volcano is depressed relative to surrounding areas. Dormant volcanoes can also emit aged carbon. Plants that photosynthesize this carbon also have lower / ratios: for example, plants on the Greek island of <b>Santorini,</b> near the volcano, have apparent ages of up to a thousand years. These effects are hard to predict– the town of Akrotiri, on <b>Santorini,</b> was destroyed in a volcanic eruption thousands of years ago, but radiocarbon dates for objects recovered from the ruins of the town show surprisingly close agreement with dates derived from other means. If the dates for Akrotiri are confirmed, it would indicate that the volcanic effect in this case was minimal.|$|E
5|$|The last notable {{members of}} the family are {{mentioned}} in Constantinople during the early centuries of the Ottoman Empire, as with Michael or Mozalos Gabras, active ca. 1555–65, or Cyril Gabras, megas skeuophylax of the Patriarchate in 1604. Other family members are attested in Crete and the Aegean islands. Thus an unnamed Gabras held lands in <b>Santorini</b> in the early 17th century; and numerous Gabrades are to be found at Chios and in Crete, especially around Siteia, until the early 19th century. For Crete in particular, it has been often supposed, although with no definitive evidence, that the local Gabrades came directly from the Pontus.|$|E
5|$|For his successes, Licario {{was rewarded}} with the post of megas konostaulos, head of the Latin mercenaries, and {{eventually}} appointed as megas doux after Philanthropenos's death in ca. 1276; the first foreigner to be thus honoured. He commanded the Byzantine navy {{in a series of}} expeditions against the Latin-held Aegean islands. The first to fall was Skopelos, whose fortress was believed to be impregnable. Licario, however, knew that it lacked water supplies. Thus, he attacked it during the hot and dry summer of 1277 and forced its surrender. Its lord, Filippo Ghisi, was captured and sent to Constantinople; his other possessions, the islands of Skyros, Skiathos and Amorgos, were also taken soon after. After that, Licario went on to capture the islands of Kythera and Antikythera off the southern coast of the Morea, and later Kea, Astypalaia, and <b>Santorini</b> in the Cyclades. The great island of Lemnos was also captured, although its lord, Paolo Navigajoso, withstood a three-year siege before surrendering.|$|E

25|$|The Omega Stone, {{the sequel}} to Riddle of the Sphinx, climaxes at an Atlantean pyramid at <b>Santorini,</b> {{and goes on to}} state that there were two Atlantis cities, one at <b>Santorini,</b> and the other at Bimini. The cataclysm caused by a comet {{fragment}} (the titular 'Omega Stone') impacting Atlanti-Santorini caused a malfunction in the laser beam constructed to destroy the comet fragment, and somehow led to the sinking of both cities (precisely how is not made clear). Furthermore, it states that the ancient Egyptians, the Maya, the Easter Islanders, the Cretans and the builders of Stonehenge were all different Atlantean tribes.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1967 lecture to the Greek Astronomical Society, {{broadcast}} on Athens Radio, <b>Santorinis</b> first publicly revealed {{what had been}} found in his 1947 investigation. [...] "We soon established that they were not missiles. But, before we could do any more, the Army, after conferring with foreign officials (presumably U.S. Defense Dept.), ordered the investigation stopped. Foreign scientists [...] flew to Greece for secret talks with me". Later <b>Santorinis</b> told UFO researchers such as Raymond Fowler that secrecy was invoked because officials were afraid to admit of a superior technology against which we have [...] "no possibility of defense".|$|R

50|$|In May 2002, {{three of}} the <b>Santorinis</b> crewmembers were convicted, by a {{military}} tribunal, of attempting to smuggle weapons into Gaza. The key legal issues were whether the weapons were destined for Gaza (over which the court had jurisdiction, {{as it was then}} occupied by Israel), and whether the crew knew that Gaza was to be the final destination of the shipment. The fourth crewmember, Va’iza’s son, was acquitted when the court determined he had not participated in the previous three attempts and that it was not proven that he knew the ship’s destination.|$|R
