5|$|Neuner {{went into}} her first Winter Olympics in Vancouver with the {{declared}} aim of winning a gold medal. On 13 February 2010, she participated in the opening sprint, which was contested at Whistler Olympic Park in rainy conditions. With one shooting error, Neuner claimed the silver medal, finishing 1.5seconds behind Slovakia's Anastasiya Kuzmina. She uncharacteristically lost five seconds against the unheralded Slovak on the cross-country course, which led to speculation of inferior ski preparation in the German media. Three days later, Neuner won gold in the subsequent pursuit race. Despite missing two targets in the standing position, she beat sprint winner Kuzmina by 12.3seconds. In her third Olympic event, she finished tenth in the individual. She had three shooting mistakes and said it had been {{difficult for her to}} immediately get her concentration back after winning her first gold medal. On 21 February 2010, Neuner claimed her second gold of the Games in the mass start. After missing two targets, she had been trailing by as much as 29seconds, but <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> pace and a clean final standing shoot allowed her to overtake Russia's Olga Zaitseva on the last lap. After the race, Neuner made the announcement not to participate in the relay, citing mental exhaustion and her desire to give all of her team mates the chance to win a medal. Her withdrawal allowed her friend Martina Beck a start in her last Olympic Games. Neuner was Germany's most successful athlete in Vancouver and was chosen to carry the German flag at the closing ceremony.|$|E
25|$|<b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> feminist {{movement}} {{to focus on}} economic issues, especially equality in employment and business as well as provision for child care and other means by which {{both women and men}} could balance family and work. She tried to lessen the focuses on abortion, as an issue already won, and on rape and pornography, which she believed most women did not consider to be high priorities.|$|E
500|$|Gittings {{found a home}} in the gay {{group that}} formed in 1970 in the American Library Association, the first gay caucus in a {{professional}} association, and became its coordinator in 1971. <b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> American Library Association for more visibility for gays and lesbians in the profession. She staffed a kissing booth at the Dallas convention of the ALA, underneath the banner [...] "Hug a Homosexual," [...] with a [...] "women only" [...] side and a [...] "men only" [...] side. When no one took advantage of it, she and Patience and Sarah author Alma Routsong (pen name: Isabel Miller) kissed in front of rolling television cameras. In describing its success, despite most of the reaction being negative, Gittings said, [...] "We needed to get an audience. So we decided, let's show gay love live. We were offering free—mind you, free—same-sex kisses and hugs. Let me tell you, the aisles were mobbed, but no one came into the booth to get a free hug. So we hugged and kissed each other. It was shown twice on the evening news, once again in the morning. It put us on the map." ...|$|E
50|$|Janelle plays a {{wide variety}} of songs, {{everything}} from folk, jazz, bluegrass and avant-garde. <b>She</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> boundaries of cello music by combining it with her voice and the music of James Hill.|$|R

500|$|Gluck, an English artist whom Brooks painted around 1923, {{was noted}} in the {{contemporary}} press as much for her style of dress as for her art. <b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> masculine style further than most by wearing trousers on all occasions, which was not considered acceptable in the 1920s. Articles about her presented her cross-dressing as an artistic eccentricity or {{as a sign that}} she was ultra-modern. [...] Brooks' portrait shows Gluck in a starched white shirt, a silk tie, and a long black belted coat that she designed and had made by a [...] "mad dressmaker"; her right hand, at her waist, holds a man's hat. Brooks painted these masculine accoutrements with the same attention she had once given to the parasols and ostrich plumes of La Belle Époque. But while many of Brooks' early paintings show sad and withdrawn figures [...] "consumed by petticoats, veiled hats and other period trappings of femininity", Gluck is self-possessed and quietly intensean artist who insists on being taken seriously. [...] Her appearance is so androgynous that {{it would be difficult to}} identify her as a woman without help from the title, and the title itselfPeter, a Young English Girlunderscores the gender ambiguity of the image.|$|E
2500|$|Commensurate {{with the}} LGBT rights {{movement}} in other arenas, LGBTQ activists began visibly advocating for greater representation in libraries in 1969. In 1970, the Task Force on Gay Liberation formed within the American Library Association. Now known as the GLBT Round Table, this organization is the oldest LGBTQ professional organization in the United States. Barbara Gittings became its coordinator in 1971. <b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> American Library Association for more visibility for gays and lesbians in the profession.

6000|$|... "Good by," [...] {{answered}} Marcia, tranquilly. The baby stirred; <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> carriage to and fro, without glancing {{after him}} as he walked away.|$|E
60|$|For a {{few seconds}} she listened. Everything was still. Then very gently <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> open <b>the</b> door.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> open <b>the</b> door, and Mrs. X, went in. The {{next moment}} {{she came out}} with a white, scared face.|$|R
60|$|Elsa made no reply. <b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> open <b>the</b> door of {{the cottage}} and went in; Béla {{followed}} her, muttering between his teeth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Safe, all safe," [...] she replied, as, {{with the}} {{assistance}} of March Marston, <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> plank across the chasm, and returned to the centre cave.|$|E
60|$|Obeying {{the least}} signal with ready and timorous acquiescence, <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> door open, but {{instantly}} recoiled with terror. It was a charnel house, half filled with dry skulls and bones.|$|E
60|$|Waiting for {{no further}} speech, <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> boat off, {{and watched it}} vanish in the darkness; then went away to give thanks, and rest after her long work and excitement.|$|E
60|$|She {{ran to the}} end of the garden. The {{gate was}} shut, but <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> against <b>the</b> rusty lock so that it came open.|$|R
6000|$|She stopped abruptly, {{and tears}} fluttered from her eyes. In {{a few seconds}} <b>she</b> continued, <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> gems away, almost passionately-- ...|$|R
5000|$|Swift began teasing an {{announcement}} in August 2014. On August 4, she posted a video on Instagram in which <b>she</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> number 18 in an elevator. On August 6, she tweeted {{an image of}} the time [...] "5:00", and the next day a screenshot from a Yahoo! homepage. She then unveiled the album cover, a Polaroid picture with [...] "T. S. 1989" [...] written underneath.|$|R
60|$|I noticed, as I approached, {{that her}} pretty face was clouded and anxious. <b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> cat irritably off her shoulder; she welcomed me {{with only the}} faint {{reflection}} of her bright customary smile.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> tangled {{hair from}} her forehead, {{mechanically}} readjusting her cumbersome garments, then she stepped close up to the young Spaniard; {{she crossed her arms}} over her breast and looked him boldly in the eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir," [...] said Susan, with a glow of {{pleasure}} on her good-looking face, as <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> tea-pot from her, and dropt the cloth, in her haste {{to get away}} to see her sire.|$|E
6000|$|... "No--it's not good." [...] <b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> away <b>the</b> book <b>she</b> {{had been}} reading and took up the band of {{tapestry}} Pansy had left on the table.|$|R
60|$|A little wearily <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> back <b>the</b> {{masses of}} {{hair from her}} forehead. Her head rested for a moment upon her fingers. Her eyes {{deliberately}} sought mine.|$|R
60|$|And <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> away <b>the</b> splendid {{picture of}} a life of ease and reached out for comradeship with a man of toil, of dreams and hidden powers.|$|R
60|$|He {{started off}} bareheaded. Estella {{followed}} {{him up the}} road breathlessly. Surely it was the strangest walk ever a girl had, she told herself with mirthless laughter. <b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> key into his hand at the porch.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> lamp-post {{away from}} her violently, and found herself walking. But another wave of faintness overtook her like a great sea, washing away her heart clean out of her breast. “I will never get there,” she muttered, {{suddenly}} arrested, swaying lightly where she stood. “Never.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> boat to the shore, where a dozen Clowns seized it {{and drew}} it far {{up on the}} grassy bank. Then Dot and Tot stepped out upon land, and as they did so every Clown present turned a {{backward}} somersault and shouted, [...] "Here we are again!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What is that apathetic being doing?' <b>she</b> demanded, <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> thick {{entangled}} locks {{from her}} wasted face. 'Has he {{fallen into a}} lethargy, or is he dead?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> open <b>the</b> {{door of the}} office, {{and finding}} its first {{apartment}} empty, led the way with Annie to the inner room, where her husband sat writing at a table.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> {{him behind}} <b>the</b> curtain where the clothes hung, and {{switched}} off the light.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> window {{still more}} widely {{open with a}} large and noble gesture. ‘Enter, Señor,’ said she. ‘The {{time has come to}} which I have long looked forward, not without alarm; when I must either fear to lose your friendship, or tell you without {{disguise}} the story of my life.’ ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> {{wavy hair}} back from her forehead--her eyes were bright, {{and there was a}} deep flush of colour in her cheeks. But the man was not to be deceived. He knew that these things were not for him. It was the {{accomplice}} she welcomed and not the man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Whisper!" [...] said Mrs. Presty, {{pointing}} to {{the open door of}} communication with Mrs. Linley's room. [...] "This is your birthday present. You mustn't look at it till you wake to-morrow morning." [...] <b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> parcel under the pillow--and, instead of saying good-night, took a chair and sat down.|$|E
6000|$|He {{sent them}} word I {{had not gone}} [...] (We know it to be true): [...] If <b>she</b> should <b>push</b> <b>the</b> matter on, [...] What would become of you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{life has}} been a martyrdom!" [...] said the girl, {{breaking}} out again in spite of herself. [...] "Oh, my father! my father!" [...] <b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> aside <b>the</b> work and hid {{her face in her}} hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "How is the night?" [...] she said, as if {{to change}} the whole feeling in <b>the</b> room. <b>She</b> <b>pushed</b> back <b>the</b> thick grey-silk curtains. [...] "Why?" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "What is that light burning? A red light?" ...|$|R
