40|$|Purpose: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) {{strongly}} encourage {{health care}} professionals to use blunt-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> {{as an alternative to}} standard <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> when <b>suturing</b> fascia and muscle to decrease the risk of needlestick injury. Blunt-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> (Figure 1), which are not as sharp as standard (sharp-tip) <b>suture</b> <b>needles,</b> are designed to penetrate muscle and fascia and reduce the risk of needlesticks. Blunttip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> are regulated by the FDA and have been marketed in the U. S. for more than 25 years. Needlestick injuries continue to occur in surgical settings when suturing muscle and fascia, despite the availability of safety-engineered devices, such as blunt-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles,</b> and the endorsement of their use by professional organizations. Needlestick injuries have the potential to expose health care personnel to bloodborne viruses, such as Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Of the estimated 384, 000 needlestick injuries occurring in hospitals each year, 23 percent occur in surgical settings. (1) Published literature indicates that while needlestick injury rates have been decreasing among non-surgical health care providers, this has not been the case among those who work in surgical settings. According to a 2010 article published in the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses Journal, more than half of needlestick injuries involving <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> occur during the suturing of fascia or muscle. (2) Published studies show that using blunt-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> reduces the risk of needlestick injuries from <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> by 69 percent. (3) Although blunt-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> currently cost some 70 cents more than their standard <b>suture</b> <b>needle</b> counterparts, the benefits of reducing the risk of serious and potentially fatal bloodborne infections for health care personnel support their use when clinically appropriate. A 2007 report suggests that the slight difference in costs of blunt- and sharp-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> is balanced by the economic savings associated with needlestick injury prevention. This report, which assessed the costs of managing occupational exposures to blood and body fluids, concluded that the cost of managing a needlestick injury can range from 376 to 2, 456 per reported incident. (4) In addition, personnel who receive needlestick injuries may experience anxiety and a loss of productivity as they await the results of blood tests. The FDA, NIOSH, and OSHA strongly encourage {{health care professionals}} in surgical settings to use blunt-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> to <b>suture</b> muscle and fascia, when clinically appropriate, {{to reduce the risk of}} needlestick injury and subsequent pathogen transmission to surgical personnel.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Safety and Health Information Bulletin is: 1. To {{describe}} the hazard of sharp-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> {{as a source of}} percutaneous injuries to surgical personnel; 2. To present evidence of the effectiveness of blunt-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> in decreasing percutaneous injuries to surgical personnel, particularly when used to suture muscle and fascia; and 3. To emphasize OSHA's requirement to use safer medical devices - in this case, blunt-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> - where clinically appropriate. Conclusion: OSHA and NIOSH strongly encourage the use of blunt-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles,</b> whenever feasible and appropriate, to decrease percutaneous injuries to surgical personnel. Clinical use and scientific studies have established the effectiveness of blunt tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> in decreasing the risk of percutaneous injuries. Employers in workplaces that use <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> have the responsibility under the Bloodborne Pathogens standard to evaluate the use of blunt-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> as well as other appropriate safer medical devices. After this evaluation, which must include input from nonmanagerial employees responsible for direct patient care [29 CFR 1910. 1030 (c) (1) (v) ] - e. g., in this case surgical personnel - employers must use safer devices to replace corresponding conventional sharp-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> in their workplaces when clinically appropriate. The introduction of any device must include training of staff in its proper use and follow-up to ensure a successful transition from conventional to safer devices. Where an employer has determined that the use of available safer devices is not feasible, the clinical justification for this determination must be documented in the facility's Exposure Control Plan and the employer must implement alternative means of protecting surgical personnel from percutaneous injuries.

40|$|Background: Health {{care workers}} are {{entitled}} to safe working conditions and the organizations {{have the responsibility to}} provide the same for their employees (HCW). In this direction the epidemiological data on sharps injury events, becomes an essential pre-requisite. Objectives: 1) To study the prevalence and associated factors of Needle Stick Injuries (NSI) among the health care workers of our hospital. 2) To assess the level of awareness of the health care workers regarding NSI. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted and data was collected using a anonymous pre-tested structured questionnaire among the respondents (441) of the health care workers of a tertiary care rural hospital. Statistical analysis was done using chi square test in Open Epi version 2. Results: About 57 % (252 out of 441) of the Health Care Workers (HCW) had at least one episode of NSI in the preceding 12 months. Majority were Nurses (81 %). The commonest devices involved was <b>suturing</b> <b>needle</b> (41 %) and hypodermic needles (44 %). Majority of the NSI (46 %) occurred during use of needle on the patient. About (85 %) of the HCW didn’t report the injury. Hepatitis B vaccination rate was very low among HCW other than doctors. Doctors had better knowledge on all counts compared to other categories of HCW. A majority of the HCW (92 %) were not aware of the reporting system existing in their hospital. Conclusions: The present study showed a high occurrence of NSI in HCWs especially among nurses followed by doctors and a high rate of ignorance and apathy among other categories. These issues need to be addressed, through appropriate education and other interventional strategies by the hospital infection control committee...|$|E

According to the edge detection principle in mathematical morphology, combined with the characteristics of the magnified images of the ends of <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> to be drilled, the morphological edge detection operators with variable structural elements are constructed to achieve noise suppression and fully extract the detailed information of edges of images of needle end holes to be drilled. Then, the subdivision method of spatial moments is adopted to realize the subpixel positioning of pixel-level edges. Finally, least squares fitting method is used to achieve the high-precision positioning of center of needle end hole to be drilled. The experimental results of the 0. 5 mm needle samples show that, the drilling method proposed in this study has a concentricity error no more than ± 0. 2 µm and an average drilling time of 0. 65 S, boasting good real-time performance and stability and meeting the automated production needs of drilling process of <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> with thread...|$|R

The Version of Record is available online at [URL] 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd. 3 D printing is of great interest for tissue engineering scaffolds due to the ability to form complex geometries and control internal structures, including porosity and pore size. The porous structure of scaffolds {{plays an important role in}} cell ingrowth and nutrition infusion. Although the internal porosity and pore size of 3 D printed scaffolds have been frequently studied, the surface porosity and pore size, which are critical for cell infiltration and mass transport, have not been investigated. The surface geometry can differ considerably from the internal scaffold structure depending on the 3 D printing process. It is vital to be able to control the surface geometry of scaffolds as well as the internal structure to fabricate optimal architectures. This work presents a method to control the surface porosity and pore size of 3 D printed scaffolds. Six scaffold designs have been printed with surface porosities ranging from 3 % to 21 %. We have characterised the overall scaffold porosity and surface porosity using optical microscopy and microCT. It has been found that surface porosity has a significant impact on cell infiltration and proliferation. In addition, the porosity of the surface has been foun d to have an effect on mechanical properties and on the forces required to penetrate the scaffold with a surgical <b>suturing</b> <b>needle.</b> To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the surface geometry of extrusion-based 3 D printed scaffolds and demonstrates the importance of surface geometry in cell infiltration and clinical manipulation...|$|E
40|$|Surgery is {{continuously}} {{subject to}} technological innovations including {{the introduction of}} robotic surgical devices. The {{ultimate goal is to}} program the surgical robot to perform certain difficult or complex surgical tasks in an autonomous manner. The feasibility of current robotic surgery systems to record quantitative motion and video data motivates developing descriptive mathematical models to recognize, classify and analyze surgical tasks. Recent advances in machine learning research for uncovering concealed patterns in huge data sets, like kinematic and video data, offer a possibility to better understand surgical procedures from a system point of view. This dissertation focuses on bridging the gap between these two lines of the research by developing computational models for task analysis in robotic-assisted surgery. The key step for advance study in robotic-assisted surgery and autonomous skill assessment is to develop techniques that are capable of recognizing fundamental surgical tasks intelligently. Surgical tasks and at a more granular level, surgical gestures, need to be quantified to make them amenable for further study. To answer to this query, we introduce a new framework, namely DTW-kNN, to recognize and classify three important surgical tasks including <b>suturing,</b> <b>needle</b> passing and knot tying based on kinematic data captured using da Vinci robotic surgery system. Our proposed method needs minimum preprocessing that results in simple, straightforward and accurate framework which can be applied for any autonomous control system. We also propose an unsupervised gesture segmentation and recognition (UGSR) method which has the ability to automatically segment and recognize temporal sequence of gestures in RMIS task. We also extent our model by applying soft boundary segmentation (Soft-UGSR) to address some of the challenges that exist in the surgical motion segmentation. The proposed algorithm can effectively model gradual transitions between surgical activities. Additionally, surgical training is undergoing a paradigm shift with more emphasis on the development of technical skills earlier in training. Thus metrics for the skills, especially objective metrics, become crucial. One field of surgery where such techniques can be developed is robotic surgery, as here all movements are already digitalized and therefore easily susceptible to analysis. Robotic surgery requires surgeons to perform a much longer and difficult training process which create numerous new challenges for surgical training. Hence, a new method of surgical skill assessment is required to ensure that surgeons have adequate skill level to be allowed to operate freely on patients. Among many possible approaches, those that provide noninvasive monitoring of expert surgeon and have the ability to automatically evaluate surgeon 2 ̆ 7 s skill are of increased interest. Therefore, in this dissertation we develop a predictive framework for surgical skill assessment to automatically evaluate performance of surgeon in RMIS. Our classification framework is based on the Global Movement Features (GMFs) which extracted from kinematic movement data. The proposed method addresses some of the limitations in previous work and gives more insight about underlying patterns of surgical skill levels...|$|E

5000|$|Some {{studies have}} found that safer needles reduce injuries, but others have shown mixed results or no benefit. The {{adherence}} to [...] "no-touch" [...] protocols that eliminate direct contact with needles during use and disposal greatly reduces the risk of needlestick injuries. In the surgical setting, especially in abdominal operations, blunt-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> were found to reduce needle stick injuries by 69%. Blunt-tip or tapered-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> can be used to sew muscle and fascia. Though they are more expensive than sharp-tipped needles, this cost is balanced by the reduction in injuries, which are expensive to treat. Sharp-tipped needles cause 51-77% of surgical needlestick injuries. The American College of Surgeons (ACS) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have endorsed the adoption of blunt-tip <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> for <b>suturing</b> fascia and muscle. Hollow-bore needles pose a greater risk of injury than solid needles, but hollow-bore needle injuries are highly preventable: 25% of hollow-bore needle injuries to healthcare professionals can be prevented by using safer needles. Gloves can also provide better protection against injuries from tapered-tip as opposed to sharp-tipped needles. In addition, the use of two pairs of gloves (double gloving) can halve the risk of needle stick injury in surgical staff. Triple gloving may be more effective than double gloving, but using thicker gloves does not make a difference. However, the evidence is of low quality. A 2014 Cochrane review found low quality evidence showing that safety devices on IV start kits and venipuncture equipment reduce the frequency of needlestick injuries. However, these safety systems can increase the risk of exposure to splashed blood. Education with training for at-risk healthcare workers can reduce their risk of needlestick injuries.

Methods: Over a two-month period in the spring of 2010, 320 general surgical attendings, subspecialty surgical attendings, and surgical resident physicians practicing at a large academic health system, were approached during or after surgical conferences to participate in a cross-sectional study. Nearly 1 / 3 rd completed an anonymous and voluntary self-administered survey. The survey included questions regarding knowledge of each technique, beliefs about effectiveness of each technique, and adherence to the guidelines. Responses were compared by surgeon rank. Results: Awareness of ACS recommendation guidelines was high among surgical attendings (68 %) and residents (60 %). While 60 % of residents adhered to these recommendations, only 43 % of attendings adhered.

PARTICIPANTS All surgical procedures (n= 333, 073) performed in 2001 - 2010 as well as 2, 113 reported BBF exposures were analyzed. METHODS Crude exposure rates were calculated; Poisson regression was used to analyze risk factors and account for procedure duration. BBF exposures involving <b>suture</b> <b>needles</b> were examined separately from those involving other device types to examine possible differences in risk factors. RESULTS The overall rate of reported BBF exposures was 6. 3 per 1, 000 surgical procedures (2. 9 per 1, 000 surgical hours). BBF exposure rates increased with estimated patient blood loss (17. 7 exposures per 1, 000 procedures with 501 - 1, 000 cc blood loss and 26. 4 exposures per 1, 000 procedures with > 1, 000 cc blood loss), number of personnel working in the surgical field during the procedure (34. 4 exposures per 1, 000 procedures having ≥ 15 personnel ever in the field), and procedure duration (14. 3 exposures per 1, 000 procedures lasting 4 to < 6 hours, 27. 1 exposures per 1, 000 procedures lasting ≥ 6 hours).

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{study the}} impact of {{educational}} activities on the rates and frequencies of percutaneous injuries (PIs) at a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia. MethodsPI surveillance is a routine activity in King Abdulaziz Medical City (a 900 -bed teaching tertiary health care hospital) in Riyadh using the Exposure Prevention Information Network (EPINet) data collection tool. From 2001 through 2003, educational activities were conducted for health care workers (HCWs) to prevent PIs. The education included lectures on the risk of unsafe practices {{that may lead to}} PIs and how to avoid them. Data from before (1997 – 2000) and after (2004 – 2008) the intervention were imported from our surveillance system and statistically analyzed. ResultsThe total overall rate of PIs per 1000 HCWs was significantly lower in the post-intervention period than in the pre-intervention period (14 vs. 32. 8 / 1000 HCWs, respectively). The rates of PIs among nurses and housekeepers showed a significant decrease (15 vs. 37. 6 / 1000 HCWs and 10 vs. 34. 5 / 1000 HCWs, respectively). The frequency of PIs in the emergency department (ED) and intensive care units (ICUs) showed a significant decrease (3. 4 % for both vs. 12. 4 % and 13. 7 %, respectively). PIs associated with devices, such as needles on IV lines, IV catheters, lancets and <b>suture</b> <b>needles,</b> showed a significant decrease.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} needle tissue interaction forces that a rigid <b>suture</b> <b>needle</b> experiences during surgical suturing. The needle-tissue interaction forces are mod-eled as the sum of lumped parameters. The model has three main components; friction, tissue compression, and cutting forces. The tissue compression force uses the area that the needle sweeps out during a suture to estimate both the force magnitude and force direction. The area that the needle sweeps out {{is a direct result}} of driving the needle in a way that does not follow the natural curve of the needle. The friction force is approximated as a static friction force along the shaft of the needle. The cutting force acts only on the needle tip. The resulting force and torque model is experimentally validated using a tissue phantom. These results indicate that the proposed lumped parameter model is capable of accurately modeling the forces experienced during a suture. I...|$|R

Homologues of CA are being widely promoted in surgery as a tissue adhesive to replace traditional suturing techniques. Potential benefits of using CA adhesives include better cosmetic results, more rapid wound closure, and perhaps most significantly, the potential for significant reductions in percutaneous injuries from <b>suture</b> <b>needles,</b> which would in turn also reduce the risk of transmission of infectious diseases. Nevertheless, certain concerns have been raised regarding the potential toxicity of CA within patients, as well as among health professionals who are occupationally exposed when using CA compounds. Reported toxicity of CA in the workplace may result in dermatological, allergic and respiratory conditions. To help reduce the occupational burden, therefore, medical staff using CA adhesives should avoid direct contact with the compound and use appropriate personal protective measures at all times. Maintaining higher levels of humidity, optimizing room ventilation and using special air conditioning filters in surgical suites and operating theatres may also be useful in minimizing the exposure to volatile CA adhesives...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{development}} of microsurgery in the 1960 s, the prognosis of peripheral nerve lesions has greatly improved. However this new technique’s evolution has remained limited by human factors, in particular by physiological tremor. Telesurgery, a technique used in other surgical fields, {{was developed in the}} 1990 s. This study assesses the feasibility of peripheral nerve repair using telemicrosurgery. Anatomical material from three subjects of different species (rat, pig, and human) was used. The telesurgical step of the procedure was performed with a Da Vinci S robot (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Four anatomical epiperineural repairs were performed. Another neurotrophic repair was per-formed with a nerve regrowth guide. Regardless of the type of repair performed, the telemanipulator removed the physiological tremor factor. The <b>suture</b> <b>needle</b> was distorted when held by two clamps at a time. Repairs were all performed without any damaging twisting movements of both nerve ends. Our results demonstrated that telesurgery allows very safe and precise peripheral nerve repairs by counteracting physiological tremor and by improving the overview of the surgical field, either with an anatomical or a neurotrophic technique...|$|R
