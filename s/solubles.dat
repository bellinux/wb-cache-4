25|$|A {{fraction}} of the maize feedstock dry matter used for ethanol production is usefully recovered as DDGS (dried distillers grains with <b>solubles).</b> In the 2010/2011 marketing year, about 29.1 million tonnes of DDGS were fed to US livestock and poultry. Because starch utilization in fermentation for ethanol production leaves other grain constituents more concentrated in the residue, the feed value per kg of DDGS, with regard to ruminant-metabolizable energy and protein, exceeds that of the grain. Feed value for monogastric animals, such as swine and poultry, is somewhat lower than for ruminants.|$|E
25|$|Bioremediation Accelerator: Oleophilic, {{hydrophobic}} chemical, containing no bacteria, which chemically {{and physically}} bonds to both soluble and insoluble hydrocarbons. The bioremediation accelerator {{acts as a}} herding agent in water and on the surface, floating molecules {{to the surface of}} the water, including <b>solubles</b> such as phenols and BTEX, forming gel-like agglomerations. Undetectable levels of hydrocarbons can be obtained in produced water and manageable water columns. By overspraying sheen with bioremediation accelerator, sheen is eliminated within minutes. Whether applied on land or on water, the nutrient-rich emulsion creates a bloom of local, indigenous, pre-existing, hydrocarbon-consuming bacteria. Those specific bacteria break down the hydrocarbons into water and carbon dioxide, with EPA tests showing 98% of alkanes biodegraded in 28 days; and aromatics being biodegraded 200 times faster than in nature they also sometimes use the hydrofireboom to clean the oil up by taking it away from most of the oil and burning it.|$|E

40|$|Summary: In this {{cross-sectional}} study, we analysed serum {{concentrations of}} <b>soluble</b> markers of cellular immune activation, namely, interferon-γ, neopterin (a product of activated macrophages), <b>soluble</b> interleukin- 2 receptor, and <b>soluble</b> CDS, in 25 patients with congestive heart failure. Ten (40 %) patients showed increased concentrations (i. e. above the reference ranges of healthy controls) of neopterin, 14 (56 %) showed increased <b>soluble</b> interleukin- 2 receptor, and 6 (24 %) showed increased <b>soluble</b> CDS. Endogenous interferon-γ was detectable in 10 patients (40 %). In addition, we found significant correlations between neopterin and interferon-γ (rs = 0. 417, p < 0. 05), and between neopterin and <b>soluble</b> CDS concentrations (rs = 0. 430, p < 0. 05). All patients with increased <b>soluble</b> CDS also had increased <b>soluble</b> interleukin- 2 receptor. However, no significant correlations of <b>soluble</b> interleukin- 2 receptor with <b>soluble</b> CDS {{or any of}} the other quantities were observed. Increased concentrations of <b>soluble</b> interleukin- 2 receptors, <b>soluble</b> CDS and neopterin indicate that cellular immunity is stimulated in patients with congestive heart failure. Activated CDS-positive T-lymphocytes may represent the source of increased <b>soluble</b> CDS. Endogenous interferon-γ, which is derived from activated T-cells, may induce neopterin release by monocytes/macrophages.

40|$|AbstractEndogenous, {{constitutive}} <b>soluble</b> epoxide hydrolase in mice 3 T 3 cells was localized via immunofluorescence microscopy {{exclusively in}} peroxisomes, whereas transiently expressed mouse <b>soluble</b> epoxide hydrolase (from clofibrate-treated liver) accumulated {{only in the}} cytosol of 3 T 3 and HeLa cells. When the C-terminal Ile of mouse <b>soluble</b> epoxide hydrolase was mutated to generate a prototypic putative type 1 PTS (-SKI to -SKL), the enzyme targeted to peroxisomes.

50|$|Water {{temperature}} is subtler but {{crucial to the}} proper extraction of flavor from the ground coffee, as it affects the proportions in which <b>solubles</b> are extracted - one wishes to extract the desired flavors as much as possible, and the undesirable flavors as little as possible. The recommended brewing temperature range of coffee is 91 - 94 °C (195 - 202 °F), which is a trade-off between these goals. If cooler, some of the <b>solubles</b> {{that make up the}} flavor will not be extracted. If the water is too hot, some undesirable, bitter, elements will be extracted, adversely affecting the taste. Note that this desired temperature range is slightly below the boiling point of water (100 °C or 212 °F at standard pressure), so coffee is best made with water that has been allowed to come off the boil slightly. Another consideration is the difference between the temperature of the water and the temperature of the coffee slurry: for example, certain brewing methods (e.g., manual pourover) can result in losing a significant amount of heat to the atmosphere during the brewing process.|$|E
