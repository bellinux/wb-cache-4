25|$|Federally, Rhode Island is a {{reliably}} Democratic state during presidential elections, usually {{supporting the}} Democratic Presidential nominee. The state {{voted for the}} Republican Presidential candidate until 1908. Since then, it has voted for the Republican nominee for President seven times, and the Democratic nominee 17 times. The last 16 presidential elections in Rhode Island {{have resulted in the}} Democratic Party winning the Ocean State's Electoral College votes 12 times. In the 1980 presidential election, Rhode Island was one of six states to vote against Republican Ronald Reagan. Reagan was the last Republican to win any of the state's counties in a Presidential election until Donald Trump won Kent County in 2016. In 1988, George H. W. Bush won over 40% of the state's popular vote, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> Republican has done since.|$|E
25|$|In the 1972 season, Davourlis scored 15 {{goals and}} Panachaiki {{finished}} sixth. The best was {{still to come}} though. After an amazing 1973 season in which he scored again 15 goals, including a hat trick in Toumba Stadium against championship contender PAOK, he achieved with Panachaiki <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> other Greek countryside club ever had done at the time: participation in a European competition, for instance the 1974 UEFA Cup. In 1974, Davourlis' performances and leadership were still very good but rumors related to his transfer affected him considerably. Panachaiki proved to be unable to become a real threat to the local powerhouses and finished once again sixth. At {{the end of a}} season during which he scored 11 times in the Championship and once in the UEFA Cup, Davourlis was transferred to Olympiacos. The transfer fee was 9.25 million Drachmas, the highest in Greek football history at the time.|$|E
25|$|Noteworthy is {{that while}} {{organizing}} assistance to the Estonian mission, Pope Alexander III was also closely following the situation in Finland, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> previous Pope {{is known to have}} done. Eskil and Stefan, the Archbishop of Uppsala, who had also been appointed to his high office by Eskil in 1164, were both close acquaintances with the Pope, having met in France while the Pope had been exiled there in the 1160s. In Pope's letter to Stefan in 1171 (or 1172), he complains how Finns only turned to God at the time of war, harassing preachers as soon as the peril was over. No Diocese or Bishop of Finland is mentioned in the papal letter, and no information survives, whether it prompted any actions. In the apparent shortage of missionaries, it can be speculated that the frustrated Pope may have organized Fulco to deal with the Finns as soon as his assistant Nicolaus could have taken over the missionary work in Estonia.|$|E

25|$|New York City Police Commissioner Julius Enderby is {{secretly}} {{a member}} of the Medievalists, a subversive anti-robot group which pines for the 'olden days' where men did not live in the 'caves of steel'. He uses his position to engineer meetings with Spacer Dr. Sarton under the guise of further cooperation, but he actually intends to destroy R. Daneel - who lives with and resembles Dr. Sarton. Enderby orders R. Sammy to bring a blaster through the unmonitored 'open air' (<b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> Earthman could countenance), but {{in the heat of the}} moment Enderby drops his glasses and fails to distinguish between the human and robot, accidentally shooting the human. Knowing that Baley's wife is also a Medievalist, he assigns Baley to the case, working with R. Daneel who represents the Spacers, and spreads a rumour about humanoid robots amongst the subversives to throw suspicion on Baley when Enderby later destroys R. Sammy with radiation. Furthermore, Daneel rules out Enderby as the murderer as his brain patterns show him incapable of deliberately killing.|$|E

Joystiq gave the game a score of 9, and stated that [...] "L.A. Noire may not always be 'fun' in the traditional sense, but it's also unsatisfied with being 'merely fun,' and the result of that aspiration is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> one who cares about video games should miss." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of the game's release, the number of tracks and sound effects was unprecedented—the soundtrack spanned three discs in its 1995 {{commercial}} pressing. Square also released a one-disc acid jazz arrangement called [...] "The Brink of Time" [...] by Guido that year. The Brink of Time came about because Mitsuda wanted to do <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> one else was doing, and he noted that acid jazz and its related genres were uncommon in the Japanese market. Mitsuda considers Chrono Trigger a landmark title which helped mature his talent. While Mitsuda later held that the title piece was [...] "rough around the edges", he maintains that it had [...] "significant influence on [...] life as a composer". In 1999, Square produced another one-disc soundtrack to complement the PlayStation release of Trigger, featuring orchestral tracks used in cut scenes. Tsuyoshi Sekito composed four new pieces for the game's bonus features which weren't included on the soundtrack. Some fans were displeased by Mitsuda's absence in creating the port, whose instruments sometimes aurally differed from the original game's. Mitsuda arranged versions of music from the Chrono series for Play! video game music concerts, presenting the main theme, Frog's Theme, and To Far Away Times. He worked with Square Enix to ensure that the music for the Nintendo DS would sound closer to the Super NES version. Mitsuda encouraged feedback about the game's soundtrack from contemporary children (who he thought would expect [...] "full symphonic scores blaring out of the speakers"). Fans who preordered Chrono Trigger DS received a special music disc containing two orchestral arrangements of Chrono Trigger music directed by Natsumi Kameoka; Square Enix also held a random prize drawing for two signed copies of Chrono Trigger sheet music. Mitsuda expressed difficulty in selecting the tune for the orchestral medley, eventually picking a tune from each era and certain character themes. Mitsuda later wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Derbyshire, culture {{editor of}} the New Statesman called it [...] "a {{remarkable}} novel" [...] and its protagonist [...] "a convincing witness to the defining moral catastrophe of the 20th century." [...] Tim Martin of The Telegraph praised the novel for not being just another story about banality of evil: [...] "it is a magnificently artificial project in character construction, a highly literary and provocative {{attempt to create a}} character various enough to match the many discontinuous realities of the apocalyptic Nazi world-view. The result is a sprawling, daring, loose-ended monster of a book, one that justifies its towering subject matter by its persistent and troubling refusal to offer easy answers and to make satisfying sense." [...] Writing for The Guardian, British author James Lasdun criticized the novel for [...] "some large flaws" [...] such as its main character, [...] "a ghoul belonging more to the fictional universe of, say, Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho", and provocative use of anachronisms, but called it a [...] "monumental inquiry into evil. To say that it falls short of Melville's visionary originality (and lacks, also, the breadth and vitality of Tolstoy, despite the claims of some reviewers) is hardly a criticism. It's a rare book that even invites such comparisons, and for all its faults, for all its problematic use of history, The Kindly Ones does just that." [...] In The Spectator, British journalist and biographer Patrick Marnham wrote: [...] "Dr Aue cannot be brought to trial because he does not exist; on the other hand, he can give us something even more valuable than vengeance, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> real war criminal can manage, and that is total honesty." [...] Harvard University's English studies' Professor Leland de la Durantaye wrote that The Kindly Ones [...] "is indeed about cruelty and evil in the way that morality plays are, but it is also about evil in history, the weaving together of hundreds of objectives, millions of people, into an ensemble so vast, diverse, and ever-changing that even a well-placed and sharp-sighted observer cannot fully grasp it." ...|$|E

[...] Bloomquist was found not guilty of felony sale and distribution and guilty of misdemeanor drug possession and possessing drug paraphernalia. [...] "When they searched the house they found a short straw that had some residue of cocaine in it. The girl had left it there," [...] Bloomquist said. He was sentenced in November 1994 to the maximum penalty, a $5,000 fine and one year in prison. It was his first misdemeanor conviction, and he filed an appeal. His sentence was cut in half to 6 months in jail. He served his time as a work release beginning in 1997.|$|E
2500|$|By doing this, Hegelian critics accuse Kierkegaard {{of using}} the {{dialectic}} to disprove the dialectic, which seems somewhat contradictory and hypocritical. However, Kierkegaard would not claim the dialectic itself is bad, only the Hegelian premise that the dialectic {{would lead to a}} harmonious reconciliation of everything, which Hegel called the Absolute. Kierkegaard stated this most clearly in his book The Concept of Anxiety, Dogmatics must not explain hereditary sin but rather explain it by presupposing it, like that vortex about which Greek speculation concerning nature had so much to say, a moving <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> science can grasp. That such is the case with dogmatics will readily be granted if once again time is taken to understand Schleiermacher’s immortal service to this science. He was left behind long ago when men chose Hegel. Yet Schleiermacher was a thinker in the beautiful Greek sense, a thinker who spoke only of what he knew.

2500|$|After he {{had already}} {{explored}} all {{that had previously been}} discovered, Bishop began to grow bored with the cave. He knew there was more out there, but there was a limit to how far the more experienced guides would go. The farthest anyone had been in the cave was to the bottomless pit: a massive hole of darkness. None would dare venture near the pit for fear of being lost forever in its depths. Bishop was brave and his curiosity was greater than his fear. Along with a guest who was equally as curious and daring as Bishop, the two men journeyed to the pit. With the help of an old ladder found nearby, they laid it across the gaping mouth of the pit and slowly ventured across the ladder. What the two men discovered opened up a whole new part of the cave. A short way further from the pit Bishop discovered a river. This was the first body of water that had ever been encountered in the cave. [...] As he explored the river he found eyeless fish: <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> one had ever heard about at this time. This brought scientists to the cave to study the new creature. Some of the most popular areas of the cave were both discovered and named by Bishop after crossing the bottomless pit.|$|E

[...] They also praised the album for having [...] "the appearance of a genuine heart, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> other big country-pop album has had since {{the glory days of}} Come On Over." [...] USA Today also praised the album for its versatility saying [...] "The songs call for vulnerability (You Won’t Find This), urgency (Flat on the Floor), sympathy (Crazy Dreams, her co-written salute to “the hairbrush singers and dashboard drummers” from whose ranks she sprang), humor (The More Boys I Meet, the tag line of which goes “The more I love my dog”) and extreme role-playing (Last Name’s saga of a bar pickup that turns into an impulsive Vegas marriage). She delivers on all counts." [...] The Boston Herald gave the album a B, and claimed, [...] "Underwood manages enough spunk to occasionally avoid the cookie-cutter, especially with the curious beat-box-meets-banjo arrangement of [...] "Get Out of This Town" [...] and [...] "Just a Dream," [...] a bona fide [...] about a young war widow." ...|$|E
