60|$|This {{time the}} wind was also favourable, but, unfortunately, a little too strong; so we were obliged, in the evening, {{to come to an}} anchor in Esquimain River. This river has good {{anchorage}} close to the bank, but is very deep in the lead, or current; this, however, we did not know at the time, and seeing a small schooner close to shore, we rounded to a few fathoms outside of her, and let go our anchor. Whirr! went the chain--ten! twelve! sixteen! till at last forty fathoms ran out, and only a little bit remained on board, and still we had no bottom. After attaching our <b>spare</b> <b>cable</b> to the other one, the anchor at last grounded. This, however, was a dangerous situation to remain in, as, if the wind blew strong, we would have to run out to sea, and so much cable would {{take a long time to}} get in; so I ordered my two men, in a very pompous, despotic way, to heave up the anchor again. But not a bit would it budge. We all heaved at the windlass; still the obstinate anchor held fast. Again we gave another heave, and smashed both the handspikes.|$|E
50|$|By making {{available}} FM radios {{to boost}} FM penetration, {{which was only}} at 3% at the time, Ted Rogers {{was able to make}} more Canadians aware of FM transmitters. CHFI-FM quickly became one of Canada's most listened to FM radio stations {{and one of the most}} popular and profitable FM radio station in Canada. Rogers's interests in radio led him to cable television in the mid-1960s. He wanted Canada's fledgling cable operators to carry CHFI on a <b>spare</b> <b>cable</b> channel and the more he studied the cable world, the more he became attracted to the potential for programming choices on cable television. He entered the cable business in 1967, and was awarded television licences for areas in and around Toronto, Brampton and Leamington.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this final}} thesis was static {{protection}} for castle in Miroslavské Knínice. It was necessary to explore several respects and find signs of violation. Next analyze and propose suitable assurance of individual parts. Separe into the stages of construction and to consider the proposal in terms of ensuring the resistance of materials. Finally create a detailed documentation in the range suitable for performance. Based on engineering geology and visual survey was designed horizontal bracing prestressing cables at three levels. The first level "A" consists of a closed circuit of prestressed reinforced concrete passports, supplemented by the cross and construction of prestressed reinforced concrete passports. Next level "B,C" is used to secure {{the top of the}} building. Levels “B,C” are proposed using prestressed cable in <b>spare</b> <b>cable</b> channels...|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} October {{a violent}} gale almost wrecked Naiad near the Île de Ré. She sat for two days on shore under the guns of a French battery, which, much to the mystification of her captain and crew, did not fire on them. On the second day the French {{commander}} sent boats with <b>spare</b> <b>cables</b> and anchors and informed Wilkinson that England had signed the preliminaries of a peace treaty with France. Naiad then returned to Plymouth on 1 November.|$|R

40|$|IET International Conference on Railway Engineering 2008, ICRE 2008, Hong Kong, 25 - 28 March 2008 Intelligent control, {{building}} automation, networking is a {{basic provisions}} for modern building as well as railway station building. All these systems rely on a physical layer to transmit signal. Wire, wireless and powerline physical layer are commonly used. However, all these layers have their limitations and associated problems especially in existing building. Existing building without sufficient <b>spare</b> <b>cable</b> containment for future wiring, concrete chasing to install new cable containment is unavoidable for wiring new network cables. In view of higher cost and great nuisance to the occupant during concrete chasing, a feasibility study of using building reinforced steel bars to transmit signals is discussed in this paper for future application. The principle of signal transmission in reinforced steel bars is similar as signal coupling in a transformer by means of magnetic flux coupling. Signals are transmitted as magnetic flux {{by means of a}} transmission coil, which is installed through reinforced steel bar and cast-in the concrete. The magnetic flux shall flow all around the reinforced steel bars framework of the entire building. Another coil acting as receiver is installed in a remote area to couple the magnetic flux and transform the signals from the transmission coil. From the experiments in laboratory and two construction buildings, it proved that the building reinforced steel bars framework is feasible as a physical data transmission media. Signals injected into reinforced steel bars can be received in remote area of the entire building in acceptance performance.

You can {{remember}} how {{it was in the}} winter months before Toulon, Stone, when we had neither firing, wine, beef, pork, nor flour aboard the ships, nor a spare piece of rope, canvas, or twine. We braced the old hulks with our <b>spare</b> <b>cables,</b> and God knows there was never a Levanter that I did not expect it to send us to the bottom. But we held our grip all the same. Yet I fear that we do not get much credit for it here in England, Stone, where they light the windows for a great battle, but they do not understand that it is easier for us to fight the Nile six times over, than to keep our station all winter in the blockade. But I pray God that we may meet this new fleet of theirs and settle the matter by a pell-mell battle." ...|$|R
60|$|He had served, as he {{was proud}} to say, {{in the last of}} our ships which had been chased out of the Mediterranean in '97, and in the first which had re-entered it in '98. He was under Miller, as third {{lieutenant}} of the Theseus, when our fleet, like a pack of eager fox hounds in a covert, was dashing from Sicily to Syria and back again to Naples, trying to pick up the lost scent. With the same good fighting man he served at the Nile, where the men of his command sponged and rammed and trained until, when the last tricolour had come down, they hove up the sheet anchor and fell dead asleep upon the top of each other under the capstan bars. Then, as a second lieutenant, he was in one of those grim three-deckers with powder- blackened hulls and crimson scupper-holes, their <b>spare</b> <b>cables</b> tied round their keels and over their bulwarks to hold them together, which carried the news into the Bay of Naples. From thence, as a reward for his services, he was transferred as first lieutenant to the Aurora frigate, engaged in cutting off supplies from Genoa, and in her he still remained until long after peace was declared.|$|R
