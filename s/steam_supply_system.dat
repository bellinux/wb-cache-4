50|$|The Reactor Protection System (RPS) is a system, {{computerized}} {{in later}} BWR models, {{that is designed}} to automatically, rapidly, and completely shut down and make safe the Nuclear <b>Steam</b> <b>Supply</b> <b>System</b> (NSSS - the reactor pressure vessel, pumps, and water/steam piping within the containment) if some event occurs that could result in the reactor entering an unsafe operating condition. In addition, the RPS can automatically spin up the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) upon detection of several signals. It does not require human intervention to operate. However, the reactor operators can override parts of the RPS if necessary. If an operator recognizes a deteriorating condition, and knows an automatic safety system will activate, they are trained to pre-emptively activate the safety system.|$|E

Such large turbo-alternator sets were not available in the UK at the time Sizewell B was designed. So that orders could be given to UK manufacturers, and to avoid project risk in dealing with what were at the time newly designed very large turbo-alternator sets, Sizewell B uses two full-speed, 3,000 RPM (50 Hz), nominal 660 MW turbo-alternator sets {{similar to those used}} at Drax coal-fired power station, and at the last of the AGRs Heysham 2, but adapted to cope with the wetter steam conditions produced by the PWR <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system.</b> PWR steam supply systems produce saturated steam at lower temperature and pressure than the dry superheated steam produced by AGR reactors or coal-fired power stations, and the high- and intermediate-pressure stages of the steam turbines have to be designed cope with this Sizewell B can run at half power using one turbo-alternator.|$|E

40|$|Steam is an {{essential}} medium used in the industrial process. To ensure steam quality, small and middle scale boilers are often adopted. However, because a higher steam pressure (compared to the necessary steam pressure) is generated, the boiler’s steam pressure will be reduced via a pressure regulator before the steam is directed through the process. Unfortunately, pressure is somewhat wasted during the reducing process. Therefore, {{in order to promote}} energy efficiency, a pressure regulator is replaced by a steam expander. With this steam expander, the pressure will be transformed into mechanical energy and extracted during the expansion process. A new type of isothermal steam expander for an industrial <b>steam</b> <b>supplying</b> <b>system</b> will be presented in the paper. The isothermal steam expander will improve the energy efficiency of a traditional steam expander by replacing the isentropic process with an isothermal expansion process. With this, steam condensation will decrease, energy will increase, and steam quality will be improved. Moreover, the mathematical model of the isothermal steam expander will be established by using the Schmidt theory, the same principle used to analyze Stirling engines. Consequently, by verifying the correctness of the theoretical model for the isothermal steam expander using experimental data, a prototype of 100 [*]c. c. isothermal steam expander is constructed...|$|R

50|$|The RPV and Nuclear <b>Steam</b> <b>Supply</b> <b>System</b> (NSSS) have {{significant}} improvements, {{such as the}} substitution of RIPs, eliminating conventional external recirculation piping loops and pumps in the containment that in turn drive jet pumps producing forced flow in the RPV. RIPs provide significant improvements related to reliability, performance and maintenance, including a reduction in occupational radiation exposure related to containment activities during maintenance outages. These pumps are powered by wet-rotor motors with the housings connected {{to the bottom of}} the RPV and eliminating large diameter external recirculation pipes that are possible leakage paths. The 10 internal recirculation pumps are located at the bottom of the annulus downcomer region (i.e., between the core shroud and the inside surface of the RPV). Consequently, internal recirculation pumps eliminate all of the jet pumps in the RPV, all of the large external recirculation loop pumps and piping, the isolation valves and the large diameter nozzles that penetrated the RPV and needed to suction water from and return it to the RPV. This design therefore reduces the worst leak below the core region to effectively equivalent to a 2 in leak. The conventional BWR3-BWR6 product line has an analogous potential leak of 24 or more inches in diameter. A major benefit of this design is that it greatly reduces the flow capacity required of the ECCS.|$|E
40|$|The {{condensate}} and feedwater system (CFS) provides feedwater at {{the required}} temperature, pressure, and flow rate to the reactor for {{boiling water reactor}} (BWR) plants and to the steam generators for pressurized water reactor (PWR) plants. Condensate is pumped from the main condenser hotwell by the condensate pumps, passes through the low pressure feedwater heaters to the feedwater pumps, and then is pumped through the high pressure feedwater heaters to the nuclear <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system.</b> ASB reviews the CFS from the condenser outlet to the connection with the nuclear <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> and to the heater drain system to assure conformance to General Design Criteria 2, 4, 5, 44, 45 and 46.

40|$|The modular high {{temperature}} gas-cooled reactor (MHTGR) {{is a typical}} small modular reactor (SMR) that offers simpler, standardized and safer modular design by being factory built, requiring smaller initial capital investment, and having a shorter construction period. Thanks to its small size, the MHTGRs could be beneficial in providing electric power to remote areas that are deficient in transmission or distribution and in generating local power for large population centers. Based on the multi-modular operation scheme, the inherent safety feature of the MHTGRs can be applicable to large nuclear plants of any desired power rating. The MHTGR-based nuclear <b>steam</b> <b>supplying</b> <b>system</b> (NSSS) is constituted by an MHTGR, a side-by-side arranged helical-coil once-through steam generator (OTSG) and some connecting pipes. Due to the side-by-side arrangement, there is a tight coupling effect between the MHTGR and OTSG. Moreover, there always exists the parameter perturbation of the NSSSs. Thus, it is meaningful to study the model-free coordinated control of MHTGR-based NSSSs for safe, stable, robust and efficient operation. In this paper, a new model-free coordinated control strategy that regulates the nuclear power, MHTGR outlet helium temperature and OTSG outlet overheated steam temperature by properly adjusting the control rod position, helium flowrate and feed-water flowrate is established for the MHTGR-based NSSSs. Sufficient conditions for the globally asymptotic closed-loop stability is given. Finally, numerical simulation results {{in the cases of}} large range power decrease and increase illustrate the satisfactory performance of this newly-developed model-free coordinated NSSS control law...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} for the ASP large early release frequency (LERF) model development {{work is to}} build a Level 2 containment response model that would capture all of the events necessary to define LERF as outlined in Regulatory Guide 1. 174, can be directly interfaced with the existing Level 1 models, is technically correct, can be readily modified to incorporate new information or to represent another plant, and can be executed in SAPHIRE. The ASP LERF models being developed will meet these objectives while providing the NRC with the capability to independently assess the risk impact of plant-specific changes proposed by the utilities that change the nuclear power plants' licensing basis. Together with the ASP Level 1 models, the ASP LERF models provide the NRC with the capability of performing equipment and event assessments to determine their impact on a plant's LERF for internal events during power operation. In addition, the ASP LERF models are capable of being updated to reflect changes in information regarding the system operations and phenomenological events, and of being updated to assess the potential for early fatalities for each LERF sequence. As the ASP Level 1 models evolve to include more analysis capabilities, the LERF models will also be refined to reflect the appropriate level of detail needed to demonstrate the new capabilities. An approach was formulated for the development of detailed LERF models using the NUREG- 1150 APET models as a guide. The modifications to the SAPHIRE computer code have allowed the development of these detailed models and the ability to analyze these models in a reasonable time. Ten reference LERF plant models, including six PWR models and four BWR models, which cover a wide variety of containment and nuclear <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems</b> designs, will be complete in 1999.

40|$|The Darlington NGS {{consists}} of four 940 MWe CANDU reactors. A detailed RELAP 5 model of a Darlington NGS reactor has been created for use with RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 3. The model includes the primary heat transport system, the steam generator feedwater and main <b>steam</b> line <b>supply</b> <b>systems.,</b> the pressure and inventory control system, and the emergency coolant injection system. The modeling of Darlington required {{the creation of new}} subroutines for RELAP 5 to describe the functionality of the process control systems and emergency control systems with sufficient accuracy. The controller subroutines are standalone modules that are compiled and linked together with RELAP 5 source to facilitate integration with future revision of the code. The controllers relevant to loss-of-flow assessment have been tested against benchmark controller responses and found to be excellent agreement. The November 25, 1993, loss-of-flow event at Darlington was simulated using RELAP 5 model. Overall excellent agreement was obtained between the RELAP 5 predictions and the station measurements. The simulation results are not sensitive to header nodalization of the three thermal-hydraulic parameters of interest to the present assessment, the header pressures and the steam generator levels compared well to station data. Assessment of core flows could not be performed due to the absence of single channel RELAP 5 models.

40|$|Department of Nuclear EngineeringThe {{possibility}} of breakaway oxidation of zirconium alloy cladding at high temperatures around 1000 ºC during {{small and large}} LOCA has been a concern in recent years. In March 2014, NRC proposed the revision of the ECCS acceptance criteria which breakaway oxidation {{was added to the}} previous criteria: the peak cladding temperature, cladding embrittlement, maximum hydrogen absorption, etc. in recent Federal Register. The standard, 10 CFR 50. 46 which is proposed by NRC requires setting up the breakaway oxidation criterion based on actual performance of the fuel cladding and confirming the criterion by the periodic test of cladding tube which is used in the plant. High temperature oxidation of zirconium alloy has different trends with the low temperature oxidation because there are several differences between the low and high temperature oxidation. Because the oxidation depends on diffusion of oxygen, hydrogen, electron, and etc., oxidation rate is increased exponentially by increasing of oxidation temperature. Phase transformations of zirconium and their oxide are also concerned at high temperature; zirconium alloy can be received the distinctive phenomena by causing phase transformation. Zirconium alloy has a passivity of oxidation from the formation of dense oxide layer. The oxidation rate of zirconium alloy is reduced exponentially at first time. But when the zirconium oxide layer is changed into non-protective phase after some moment, oxidation kinetics is turned into linear or exponentially increased through the time. The transition of oxidation kinetics causes surface discoloration and this phenomenon is called as ‘breakaway oxidation’. As mentioned before, the transition of oxidation kinetics is usually faster at higher temperature. But breakaway oxidation can be easily observed at certain points which are 800 ºC and 1000 ºC not at higher temperature. In order to simulate LOCA condition which is represented by the high temperature steam oxidation of rapidly heated cladding and subsequent quenching by water, a radiant heating system with the <b>steam</b> and water <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> are used for the test. A radiant heating system that used in the most of LOCA simulation tests, adopts the 4 or 6 line bulbs in order to achieve uniform heating in a circumferential direction. The verification of test equipment should be performed with the sequence of draft regulatory guide which is published by U. S NRC. Axial and circumferential temperature distribution is measured by a specimen with the welded thermocouples and the results of measurement are satisfied with the recommendation in the guide. The <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> equipment is one of the important systems for the high temperature oxidation test because the high temperature oxidation test should be conducted in steam ambient. But the initial <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> equipment has a problem which is unstable steam flow, so the new <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> equipment was installed on the <b>system.</b> The new <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> equipment don’t show any unstable steam flow and the steam generation rates of new <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> equipment were measured by plate-type heat exchanger. The measurement of weight gain was performed and the results of measurement are compared with the well-established data of ZIRLO which was tested by Westinghouse and ANL. The results of ZIRLO weight gain measurement are consistent with the well-established data and these results are verified the high temperature oxidation test successfully. The microstructure of ZIRLO after the high temperature oxidation test is confirmed. At the first time, the microstructure of ZIRLO has flat interface between metal and oxide, but wavy metal / oxide interface can be observed in the picture after some moment. Wavy interface between metal and oxide is estimated to the precursor to breakaway oxidation phenomenon and the microstructure after the high temperature oxidation test is shown similar as the most of previous research. Thus, the successful test results are shown in the microstructure. ope...|$|R
