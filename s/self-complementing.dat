In this paper, we apply the concept of bipolar fuzzy sets to graph structures. We introduce certain notions, including bipolar fuzzy graph structure (BFGS), strong bipolar fuzzy graph structure, bipolar fuzzy Ni-cycle, bipolar fuzzy Ni-tree, bipolar fuzzy Ni-cut vertex, and bipolar fuzzy Ni-bridge, and illustrate these notions by several examples. We study ϕ-complement, <b>self-complement,</b> strong <b>self-complement,</b> and totally strong <b>self-complement</b> in bipolar fuzzy graph structures, and we investigate some of their interesting properties...|$|R

The <b>self-complemented</b> construct FimGt-DSF was obtained by fusing the FimF donor strand (ADSTITIRGYVRDN) via a (Gly) 9 -linker to the C-terminus of FimGt (FimG lacking the natural donor strand, i. e. residues 1 - 14). For cloning of these variants standard PCR procedures and genomic DNA of E. coli W 3110 as template were used.

Every permutation sigma of the set V such that sigma(e) is an edge of (H) over bar if and only if e is an element of E is called <b>self-complementing.</b> 2 -self-comlementary hypergraphs are exactly self complementary graphs introduced independently by Ringel (1963) and Sachs (1962).

In the paper we prove that a permutation sigma of [1, n] with orbits O- 1, [...] ., O-m O m is a <b>self-complementing</b> permutation of a k-uniform hypergraph of order n if and only if there is an integer l >= 0 such that k = a 2 (l) + s, a is odd, 0 (i) n = b 2 (l+ 1) + r,r is an element of { 0, [...] ., 2 (l) - 1 + s}, and (ii) Sigma(i:lambda(vertical bar Oi vertical bar) For k = 2 this result is the very well known characterization of <b>self-complementing</b> permutation of graphs given by Ringel and Sachs...|$|E
40|$|Amyloid-beta (Aβ) {{aggregates}} are {{the main}} constituent of senile plaques, the histological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. Aβ molecules form β-sheet containing structures that assemble {{into a variety of}} polymorphic oligomers, protofibers, and fibers that exhibit a range of lifetimes and cellular toxicities. This polymorphic nature of Aβ has frustrated its biophysical characterization, its structural determination, and our understanding of its pathological mechanism. To elucidate Aβ polymorphism in atomic detail, we determined eight new microcrystal structures of fiber-forming segments of Aβ. These structures, all of short, <b>self-complementing</b> pairs of β-sheets termed steric zippers, reveal a variety of modes of self-association of Aβ. Combining these atomic structures with previous NMR studies allows us to propose several fiber models, offering molecular models for some of the repertoire of polydisperse structures accessible to Aβ. These structures and molecular models contribute fundamental information for understanding Aβ polymorphic nature and pathogenesis...|$|E

Previous studies on T. brucei showed that acyl carrier protein (ACP) of mitochondrial fatty acid synthase type 2 (FASII) {{plays a crucial role}} in parasite survival. Additionally, 3 -oxoacyl-ACP synthase TbKASIII as well as TbHTD 2 representing 3 -hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase were also identified; however, 3 -oxoacyl-ACP reductase TbKAR 1 has hitherto evaded positive identification. Here, potential Leishmania FASII components LmjF 07. 0440 and LmjF 07. 0430 were revealed as 3 -hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratases LmHTD 2 - 1 and LmHTD 2 - 2, respectively, whereas LmjF 27. 2440 was identified as LmKAR 1. These Leishmania proteins were ectopically expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae htd 2 &#x 0394; or oar 1 &#x 0394; respiratory deficient cells lacking the corresponding mitochondrial FASII enzymes Htd 2 p and Oar 1 p.

40|$|Recombinant Adeno-associated virus vectors (rAAV) {{are widely}} used for gene {{delivery}} and multiple naturally occurring serotypes have been harnessed to target cells in different tissues and organs including the brain. Here, we provide a detailed and quantitative analysis of the transduction profiles of rAAV vectors based on six {{of the most commonly}} used serotypes (AAV 1, AAV 2, AAV 5, AAV 6, AAV 8, AAV 9) that allows systematic comparison and selection of the optimal vector for a specific application. In our studies we observed marked differences among serotypes in the efficiency to transduce three different brain regions namely the striatum, hippocampus and neocortex of the mouse. Despite the fact that the analyzed serotypes have the general ability to transduce all major cell types in the brain (neurons, microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes), the expression level of a reporter gene driven from a ubiquitous promoter varies significantly for specific cell type / serotype combinations. For example, rAAV 8 is particularly efficient to drive transgene expression in astrocytes while rAAV 9 appears well suited for the transduction of cortical neurons. Interestingly, we demonstrate selective retrograde transport of rAAV 5 along axons projecting from the ventral part of the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, we show that <b>self-complementing</b> rAAV can be used to significantly decrease the time required for the onset of transgene expression in the mouse brain...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis report {{describes}} {{a very simple}} method that facilitates {{the analysis of the}} functional activity of essential genes of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) in cell culture. The method, which depends on the use of complementing plasmids containing a virus origin of replication (oriS) and a packaging signal (amplicon plasmids), was tested for its ability to detect complementation of the defective HSV- 1 CgalΔ 42 virus, a UL 42 null mutant, by amplicon plasmids carrying either wild-type (pA-UL 42) or mutated alleles (pA-ΔUL 42) of the HSV- 1 UL 42 gene. In nonpermissive Vero cells transfected with amplicon plasmid pA-UL 42 and superinfected with the defective CgalΔ 42 virus, both the plasmid and the helper genomes were amplified and packaged, giving rise to a <b>self-complementing</b> amplicon/helper virus population able to disseminate and to form lytic plaques in cell culture. These plaques were due to complementation and not to recombination between the defective virus and the amplicon plasmid as confirmed by Southern blot analysis of individual plaques. No complementation was observed by superinfection of cells transfected with the noncomplementing pA-ΔUL 42 amplicon plasmid. Instead, small foci were observed in cells transfected with plasmids which express wild-type UL 42 but were unable to amplify or to become packaged, and the few true lytic plaques that were observed in these systems resulted from the spread of competent recombinant viruses. Results presented in this work indicate that (i) self-complementation between a defective virus and an amplicon plasmid provides a strong and very sensitive method to assess functional activity of an HSV- 1 essential gene in a one-step experiment and (ii) oriS-carrying plasmids could be instrumental in the production and selection of recombinant HSV- 1 vectors...|$|E
40|$|Background: Multiplication is {{the basic}} {{operation}} in any signal processing systems and financial applications, all these applications requires multiplication to be performed in a faster and efficient manner on a silicon chip. Methods: This paper describes the algorithm and architecture of a BCD parallel multiplier. The design exploits two properties of redundant BCD codes to speed up its computation. Namely, the redundant BCD excess- 3 code (XS- 3), and the overloaded BCD representation (ODDS). In addition to this, number of new techniques are used {{in order to reduce}} significantly latency, area and for implementation on FPGA compared to existing implementations. Findings: Parallel architecture is used for generating partial products using radix- 10 recoding technique for signed-digit of a BCD multiplier having set of digits between the range [– 5, 5] and a positive set of multiplicand multiples coded in XS- 3. Use of this encoding has various advantages like, as XS- 3 is a <b>self-complementing</b> code, finding a negative of it is by just complementing the bits of respective number. Also the redundancy in XS- 3 code is utilized for generating multiplicand multiples in a simple, faster and a carry-free way. Implemented design has three stages. Partial product generation, reduction and final conversion to BCD. For to implement the design in hardware the partial product reduction architecture is modified here to use a bank of ripple carry adder trees. ODDS representation uses 4 -bit binary encoding technique which is similar to non-redundant BCD code, for this reason conventional VLSI circuit techniques such as carry-save adders and compression trees can be used effectively to perform operations on decimal numbers. Conclusion: To show the advantages of the resulted design, RTL model for 8 × 8 -digit and 16 × 16 -digits multiplication has been synthesized and implemented in Virtex- 5 FPGA device. Results shows that the multiplier is about 10 – 15 % delay efficient with existing work and about 14 – 18 % area efficient...|$|E
40|$|Crohn's disease (CD) is an {{inflammatory}} bowel disease characterized by an exaggerated immune response to commensal microbiota in the intestines of patients. Metagenomic studies have identified specific bacterial species and strains with increased prevalence in CD patients, amongst which is the adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) strain LF 82. AIEC strains express long polar fimbriae (LPF), which are known to target Peyer's patches in a mouse CD model. Here, the recombinant production of a soluble, <b>self-complemented</b> construct of the LpfD protein of E. coli LF 82 is reported and it is demonstrated that it forms the adhesive tip subunit of LPF. The LpfD crystal reveals an N-terminal adhesin domain and a C-terminal pilin domain that connects the adhesin to the minor pilus subunit LpfE. Surface topology and sequence conservation in the adhesin domain hint at a putative receptor-binding pocket as found in the Klebsiella pneumoniae MrkD and E. coli F 17 -G (GafD) adhesins. Immunohistostaining of murine intestinal tissue sections revealed that LpfD specifically binds to the intestinal mucosa and submucosa. LpfD binding {{was found to be}} resistant to treatment with O- or N-glycosidases, but was lost in collagenase-treated tissue sections, indicating the possible involvement of an intestinal matrix-associated protein as the LpfD receptor. LpfD strongly adhered to isolated fibronectin in an in vitro assay, and showed lower levels of binding to collagen V and laminin and no binding to collagens I, III and IV...|$|R
40|$|The {{sequential}} deletion {{method is}} commonly applied {{to locate the}} functional domain of a protein. Unfortunately, manually designing primers for multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a labor-intensive task. In order to Speed LIP the experimental Procedure and to improve the efficiency of producing PCR products, this paper proposes a Multiplex PCR primers (MPCRPs) designer to design multiple forward primers with a single 3 '-UTR reverse primer for extracting various N-terminal truncated mutants to quickly locate the functional domain of a cDNA sequence. Several factors, including melting temperature, primer length, GC content, internal <b>self-complement,</b> cross-dimerization, terminal limitation, and specificity, are used as the criteria for designing primers. This study obtains a near-optimal solution of primer sets that can be placed in as few test tubes as possible for one multiplex PCR experiment. Results: Homo sapiens ribosomal protein L 5, Homo sapiens xylosyltransferase 1, and Bacteriophage T 4 gene product 11 were used as test examples to verify efficacy of the proposed algorithm. In addition, the designed primers of Homo sapiens ribosomal protein L 5 cDNA were applied in multiplex PCR experiments. A total of 48 forward primers and one reverse primer were designed and used to duplicate N-terminal truncated mutants of different lengths from the protein. The primers were classified into eight tube groups (i. e., test tubes) held within the same temperature range (53 - 57 C), and {{the validity of the}} PCR products were verified using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) with the functional domain correctly located. A software implementation of the proposed algorithm useful in assisting the researcher to design primers for multiplex PCR experiments was developed and available upon request. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Our {{recognition}} of the mitochondria as being important sites of fatty acid biosynthesis is continuously unfolding, {{especially in light of}} new data becoming available on compromised fatty acid synthase type 2 (FASII) in mammals. For example, perturbed regulation of murine 17 beta-HSD 8 encoding a component of the mitochondrial FASII enzyme 3 -oxoacyl-thioester reductase is implicated in polycystic kidney disease. In addition, over-expression in mice of the Mecr gene coding for 2 -trans-enoyl-thioester reductase, also of mitochondrial FASII, leads to impaired heart function. However, mouse knockouts for mitochondrial FASII have hitherto not been reported and, hence, {{there is a need to}} develop alternate metazoan models such as nematodes or fruit flies. Here, the identification of Caenorhabditis elegans W 09 H 1. 5 /MECR- 1 as a 2 -trans-enoyl-thioester reductase of mitochondrial FASII is reported. To identify MECR- 1, Saccharomyces cerevisiae etr 1 Delta mutant cells were employed that are devoid of mitochondrial 2 -trans-enoyl-thioester reductase Etr 1 p. These yeast mutants fail to synthesize sufficient levels of lipoic acid or form cytochrome complexes, and cannot respire or grow on non-fermentable carbon sources. A mutant yeast strain ectopically expressing nematode mecr- 1 was shown to contain reductase activity and resemble the <b>self-complemented</b> mutant strain for these phenotype characteristics. Since MECR- 1 was not intentionally targeted for compartmentalization using a yeast mitochondrial leader sequence, this inferred that the protein represented a physiologically functional mitochondrial 2 -trans-enoyl-thioester reductase. In accordance with published findings, RNAi-mediated knockdown of mecr- 1 in C. elegans resulted in life span extension, presumably due to mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, old mecr- 1 (RNAi) worms had better internal organ appearance and were more mobile than control worms, indicating a reduced physiological age. This is the first report on RNAi work dedicated specifically to curtailing mitochondrial FASII in metazoans. The availability of affected survivors will help to position C. elegans as an excellent model for future pursuits in the emerging field of mitochondrial FASII research...|$|R
