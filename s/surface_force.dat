25|$|VSI crushers use a {{different}} approach involving a high speed rotor with wear resistant tips and a crushing chamber designed to 'throw' the rock against. The VSI crushers utilize velocity rather than <b>surface</b> <b>force</b> as the predominant force to break rock. In its natural state, rock has a jagged and uneven surface. Applying <b>surface</b> <b>force</b> (pressure) results in unpredictable and typically non-cubical resulting particles. Utilizing velocity rather than <b>surface</b> <b>force</b> allows the breaking force to be applied evenly both {{across the surface of}} the rock as well as through the mass of the rock. Rock, regardless of size, has natural fissures (faults) throughout its structure. As rock is 'thrown' by a VSI Rotor against a solid anvil, it fractures and breaks along these fissures. Final particle size can be controlled by 1) the velocity at which the rock is thrown against the anvil and 2) the distance between the end of the rotor and the impact point on the anvil. The product resulting from VSI Crushing is generally of a consistent cubical shape such as that required by modern SUPERPAVE highway asphalt applications. Using this method also allows materials with much higher abrasiveness to be crushed than is capable with an HSI and most other crushing methods.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{is described in}} which a mica surface is driven towards a mercury drop immersed in aqueous electrolyte. Under appropriate conditions, hydrodynamic pressure in the aqueous film creates a classical dimple in the mercury drop. The use of optical interferometry and video recording to monitor {{the shape of the}} drop and the thickness of the aqueous film with sub-nanometre resolution yields a high density of precise data showing the formation and evolution of the dimple as the film drains. Variation of electrical potential applied to the mercury phase allows control of the <b>surface</b> <b>forces</b> acting between the drop and the mica surface, so that the effect of <b>surface</b> <b>forces</b> on the film drainage process is highlighted. It is found that the film thickness at the centre of the dimple and the lateral extent of the dimple are not significantly affected by <b>surface</b> <b>forces.</b> On the other hand, the minimum film thickness {{at the edge of the}} dimple is sensitive even to weak <b>surface</b> <b>forces.</b> Since this minimum film thickness is a major determinant of the film drainage rate, it is shown that <b>surface</b> <b>forces</b> have an important effect on the overall drainage process. <br /...|$|R

25|$|Following {{the earlier}} successes of Monte Carlo simulations, the method was first {{developed}} by Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and Tsingou {{in the mid}} 50s. In 1957, Alder and Wainwright used an IBM 704 computer to simulate perfectly elastic collisions between hard spheres. In 1960, Gibson et al., simulated radiation damage of solid copper by using a Born-Mayer type of repulsive interaction along with a cohesive <b>surface</b> <b>force.</b> In 1964, Rahman published landmark simulations of liquid argon that used a Lennard-Jones potential.

After the American entry into World War II and the Japanese attacks on the Philippines, Asheville, and most of the surface ships in the Philippines, moved to Java to defend the Malay Barrier against the Japanese advance. When the Allied defense crumbled in early March, the remaining American ships were ordered to retreat to Australia. Sailing alone, Asheville was spotted, attacked, and sunk south of Java by a Japanese <b>surface</b> <b>force</b> of a heavy cruiser and two destroyers on 3 March 1942.|$|E

The Admiralty also instructed the safety of the convoy from surface attack to the westward of Bear Island depended on Allied surface forces, while to the eastward it was to be met by Allied submarines. Furthermore, the convoy's cruiser covering force was not to go east of Bear Island, unless the convoy was threatened by the presence of a <b>surface</b> <b>force</b> which the cruiser force could fight, nor to go beyond 25° East under any circumstance.|$|E
25|$|Monssen resumed her {{position}} in the fast carrier force for further strikes on Japan on the 23d, followed by sweeps of the Ryūkyūs.

A week after the initial assault, she proceeded north to intercept a Japanese <b>surface</b> <b>force</b> headed south. During this engagement, carrier planes sank the super-battleship Yamato. On 11 May, Monssen retired to Ulithi for replenishment, returning to Okinawa on the 28th. After a week on picket station, she steamed north for fighter sweeps over Kyūshū, 2–3 June, then returned to Okinawa, whence she departed for further raids on Kyūshū, 8 June, and the bombardment of various northern Ryūkyū points.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} force, under Brown, stood toward Rabaul {{until the}} Japanese landings at Lae and Salamaua, New Guinea prompted {{a change of}} plans. Late on 8 March, Brown and his staff decided to shift objectives and attack the two new enemy beachheads by launching planes from the Gulf of Papua {{in the south and}} sending them across the width of New Guinea to the targets on the northern coast. Astoria, meanwhile, joined a <b>surface</b> <b>force</b> made up of heavy cruisers Chicago, Louisville, and , and destroyers Anderson, Hammann, , and Sims under the command of Rear Admiral John G.
