5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Gaveston's death, however, civil conflict in England rarely <b>seemed</b> <b>far</b> away, and it is currently believed that Thomas probably intended to create a secure retreat, a safe distance away from Edward's forces in the south. He also probably hoped to erect a prominent status symbol, illustrating his wealth and authority, and challenging that of the King. He may perhaps also have hoped to create a planned town alongside the castle, possibly intending to relocate the population of Embleton there.|$|E

The green slopes that he envisioned and built on his courses were the single best defense of a hole.|$|E
5|$|Strategic losses <b>seemed</b> <b>far</b> greater. The French army's {{ability to}} cross the Rhine at will gave them an advantage. Charles could not move much of his army away from Mannheim or Karlsruhe, where the French had also formed across the river; loss of the {{crossings}} at Hüningen, near the Swiss city of Basel, and the crossing at Kehl, near the Alsatian city of Strasbourg, guaranteed the French ready-access to most of southwestern Germany. From there, Moreau's troops could fan out over the flood plain around Kehl to prevent any approach from Rastadt or Offenburg.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon did {{not stay}} still. The French Emperor decided {{to set a}} {{psychological}} trap in order to lure the Allies out. Days before any fighting, Napoleon had been giving the impression that his army was weak and that he desired a negotiated peace. About 53,000 French troops—including Soult, Lannes and Murat's forces—were assigned to take Austerlitz and the Olmutz road, occupying the enemy's attention. The Allied forces, numbering about 89,000, <b>seemed</b> <b>far</b> superior and would be tempted to attack the outnumbered French army. However, the Allies {{did not know that}} Bernadotte, Mortier and Davout were already within the supported distance, and could be called in by forced marches from Iglau and Vienna respectively, raising the French number to 75,000 troops.|$|E
25|$|Paris started mobilizing for war in September 1939, when Nazi Germany invaded Poland, {{but the war}} <b>seemed</b> <b>far</b> {{away until}} May 10, 1940, when the Germans {{attacked}} France and quickly defeated the French army. The French government departed Paris on June 10, and the Germans occupied the city on June 14. During the Occupation, the French Government moved to Vichy, and Paris was governed by the German military and by French officials approved by the Germans.|$|E
25|$|After {{the demise}} of his father Bhaktivinoda on 23 June 1914, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati {{relocated}} his Calcutta press to Mayapur and then to nearby Krishnanagar in the Nadia district. From there he continued publishing Bhaktivinoda's Sajjana-toshani, and completed the publication of Chaitanya Charitamrita. Soon after, his guru Gaurakishora Dasa Babaji also died. Without these two key sources of inspiration, and {{with the majority of}} Bhaktivinoda's followers being married and thus unable to pursue a strong missionary commitment, Bhaktisiddhanta found himself nearly alone with a mission that <b>seemed</b> <b>far</b> beyond his means. When a disciple suggested that Bhaktisiddhanta relocate to Calcutta to establish a center there, he was inspired by the suggestion and began preparing for its implementation.|$|E

[...] Edwards made an appearance on the February 22, 2006, episode of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. Ferguson produced the cover of the February issue of ESPN The Magazine which featured a bare-chested photo of Edwards. Joking that Edwards' nipples <b>seemed</b> <b>far</b> apart, Ferguson suggested this was because of the high speeds at which Edwards often traveled.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the play}} in general, the {{reviewer}} did say it, [...] "begins badly but steadily improves; {{the first two}} scenes, which are dull and slow, might be telescoped. Mr. Morton, indeed, had a difficult job to perform in dramatising the novel, for the cleverness of Mrs. Christie's story lies {{not so much in}} the plot as in {{the fact that it is}} told by the murderer. Mr. Laughton, however, added so much to the part of Poirot that they play <b>seemed</b> <b>far</b> bigger than it is." [...] This reviewer, unlike the others quoted, did state that the rest of the cast was also [...] "excellent".|$|E

2500|$|Remarkably, this match {{turned out}} to be as {{exciting}} as the previous one had been. It has become known as [...] "Jessop's match", for his 104 in only 77 minutes in England's second innings turned the game. When he came to the wicket, England were 48/5, and scoring the 263 that they needed to win <b>seemed</b> <b>far</b> beyond them. Saunders had taken four of the wickets. Jessop's previous highest Test score was only 55, but now he reached his hundred off just 76 balls, after an uncertain start when he gave two chances with his score in the twenties. He and Jackson added 109, before Jackson was out for 49 to make the score 157/6. Hirst helped him take the score to 187 before Jessop himself was out. Wisden said of his innings: All things considered a more astonishing display has never been seen. What he did would have been scarcely possible under the same circumstances to any other living batsmen.|$|E
2500|$|Gallagher {{expressed}} further criticism on Tismăneanu, {{writing that}} [...] "he wishes {{to build up}} a vast patron-client network in contemporary history and political science not dissimilar to what the PSD did in those areas where it desired control". Referring to Tismăneanu's books, he also wrote: [...] "But what {{about the role of the}} Securitate? In his books, [...] has never been especially interested in their role. Much of the time, he has <b>seemed</b> <b>far</b> more concerned with creating a psycho-biography of the life and times of his illegalist family in order to overcome the long lasting shock of having been cast into the wilderness for over twenty years when his family fell from grace under Gheorghiu-Dej." [...] In other pieces he authored, Gallagher questioned Tismăneanu's expertise, comparing him to the Romanian-French businessman Adrian Costea, a person close to Iliescu who stood accused of encouraging political corruption, and claiming that he was using the academic environment as a venue for lobbying. He also took a negative view of his colleague's earlier collaboration with Jurnalul Național, a newspaper owned by Conservative Party leader Dan Voiculescu (who has been officially linked with the Securitate). Additionally, Gallagher complained about the publicized visit Tismăneanu paid to Gigi Becali, leader of the nationalist New Generation Party – Christian Democratic, at his residence in Pipera.|$|E
2500|$|Stewart was {{concerned}} that his expertise and celebrity status would relegate him to instructor duties [...] "behind the lines". His fears were confirmed when, after his promotion to first lieutenant on July 7, 1942, he was stationed from August to December 1942 at Kirtland Army Airfield in Albuquerque, New Mexico, piloting AT-11 Kansans used in training bombardiers. He was transferred to Hobbs Army Airfield, New Mexico, for three months of transition training in the four-engine B-17 Flying Fortress, then sent to the Combat Crew Processing Center in Salt Lake City, where he expected to be assigned to a combat unit. Instead, he was assigned in early 1943 to an operational training unit, the 29th Bombardment Group at Gowen Field, Boise, Idaho, as an instructor. He was promoted to captain on July 9, 1943, and appointed a squadron commander. To Stewart, now 35, combat duty <b>seemed</b> <b>far</b> away and unreachable, {{and he had no}} clear plans for the future. However, a rumor that Stewart would be taken off flying status and assigned to making training films or selling bonds called for immediate action, because what he dreaded most was [...] "the hope-shattering spectre of a dead end". Stewart appealed to his commander, 30-year-old Lt. Col. Walter E. Arnold Jr., who understood his situation and recommended Stewart to the commander of the 445th Bombardment Group, a B-24 Liberator unit that had just completed initial training at Gowen Field and gone on to final training at Sioux City Army Air Base, Iowa.|$|E
