40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} combinations of multiple, variable-intensity silvicultural treatments on fire and habitat management objectives were evaluated for a ± 6, 000 ha forest reserve using simulation models and optimization techniques. Our methods help identify areas within the reserve where opportunities exist to minimize conflict between the dual landscape objectives. Results suggest {{that most of the}} trees removed by silvicultural treatments designed to support fire and habitat objectives, while generating enough revenue to break-even, would be medium-sized (17 - 40 cm), shade-tolerant conifers. The study produced information that was used by a planning team on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest to develop stand-level treatments based on mid-scale landscape patterns. New contracting authorities give the Forest Service ways to offer sales that support landscape management objectives in the reserve, but the contracts are time-consuming to prepare and award.

40|$|Colonization {{is crucial}} to habitat {{restoration}} projects that rely on the spontaneous regeneration of the original vegetation. However, as a previously declining plant species spreads again, the likelihood of founder effects increases through recurrent population founding and associated serial bottlenecks. We related Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism markers genetic variation and fitness to colonization history for all extant populations of the outcrossing terrestrial orchid Dactylorhiza incarnata in an isolated coastal dune complex. Around 1970, D. incarnata suffered a severe bottleneck yet ultimately persisted and gradually spread throughout the spatially segregated dune slacks, aided by the restoration of an open vegetation. Genetic assignment demonstrated dispersal to vacant sites from few nearby extant populations and very limited inflow from outside the spatially isolated reserve. Results further indicated that recurrent founding from few local sources resulted {{in the loss of}} genetic diversity and promoted genetic divergence (FST = 0. 35) among populations, but did not influence population fitness. The few source populations initially available and the limited inflow of genes from outside the <b>study</b> <b>reserve,</b> as a consequence of habitat degradation and spatial isolation, may have magnified the genetic effects of recurrent population founding...|$|E
40|$|Reserve {{growth is}} {{recognized}} as {{a major component of}} additions to reserves in most oil provinces around the world, particularly in mature provinces. It takes place {{as a result of the}} discovery of new pools/reservoirs and extensions of known pools within existing fields, improved knowledge of reservoirs over time leading to a change in estimates of original oil-in-place, and improvement in recovery factor through the application of new technology, such as enhanced oil recovery methods, horizontal/multilateral drilling, and 4 D seismic. A reserve growth study was conducted on oil pools in Alberta, Canada, with the following objectives: 1) evaluate historical oil reserve data in order to assess the potential for future reserve growth; 2) develop reserve growth models/ functions to help forecast hydrocarbon volumes; 3) <b>study</b> <b>reserve</b> growth sensitivity to various parameters (for example, pool size, porosity, and oil gravity); and 4) compare reserve growth in oil pools and fields in Alberta with those from other large petroleum provinces around the world. The reported known recoverable oil exclusive of Athabasca oil sands in Alberta increased from 4. 5 billion barrels of oil (BBO) in 1960 to 17 BBO in 2005. Some of the pools that were included in the existing database were excluded from the present study for lack of adequate data. Therefore, the known recoverable oil increased from 4. 2 to 13. 9 BBO over the period from 1960 through 2005, with new discoveries contributing 3. 7 BBO and reserve growth adding 6 BBO. Thi...|$|E

Because cash flow analysis concerns itself only with actual transactions, it mathematically cannot be used for future planning of any costs that change with time, regardless of whether those changes result from actual changes in costs or inflation, unless it is revised often with updated future costs. In addition, because future cost estimates based on cash flow analysis are linear, while inflation is not; mathematically, using cash flow calculations to determine reserve deposits cannot calculate required deposits that equitably distribute costs among owners in proportion to their ownership, cannot assure that sufficient funds will always be available when they are needed, and cannot accurately determine current status.|$|R
