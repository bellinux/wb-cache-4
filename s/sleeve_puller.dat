The design is a runway system, consisting of a platform incorporating rails on which the carriages run as they bear the rotor being pulled with a pulling jack. We utilized statically indeterminate approach to design the platform to very high flexural rigidity to avoid deflection, a necessary condition, to prevent damage to the generator field winding. The design was successful; the system constructed and used to pull-out/pull-in six rotors of the gas turbine generators; and is still being stored for further use when the need arises...|$|E

This process places samples in individual sleeves that are sealed within a container for use by either the current mission or by following missions. A sample container is stored with its sleeves partially inserted. When a sample is ready to be contained, a transfer arm rotates over and grasps a <b>sleeve,</b> <b>pulls</b> it out of the container from below, rotates over and inserts the sleeve into a funnel where it is passively locked into place and then released from the arm. An external sampling tool deposits the sample into the sleeve, which is aligned with the tool via passive compliance of the funnel. After the sampling tool leaves the funnel, the arm retrieves the sleeve and inserts it all the way into the sample container. This action engages the seal. Full containers can be left behind for pick-up by subsequent science missions, and container dimensions are compatible for placement in a Mars Ascent Vehicle for later return to Earth...|$|R

40|$|Observation on {{previous}} comments on incomplete IUS removal A 61 -year-old para 1 + 1 {{type 2 diabetic}} patient attended our walk-in clinic for her intrauterine system (IUS) to be removed. The IUS had been inserted over 10 years previously and she had apparently forgotten about it. She had been amenorrhoeic for at least 6 years, presumably because she had reached the menopause. Examination revealed an atrophic lower genital tract and atro-phic cervix, with the IUS threads visible. The IUS was removed but its horizontal arms appeared to be missing (Figure 1). A pelvic ultrasound scan did not locate any foreign body in the uterus, and an abdominal X-ray was normal. Because this {{appeared to be an}} unusual event, the IUS was preserved in formalin. On reading Brechin’s letter 1 and Alanko et al. ’s response 2 in the October 2014 Journal, the IUS was retrieved, re-examined and the <b>sleeve</b> gently <b>pulled</b> towards the IUS tail (Figures 2 and 3). This clearly showed that the IUS sleeve was covering the horizontal arms. It would appear that during the removal process the sleeve had slid cranially as the IUS was pulled through the internal os and a cervical canal that were presumably narrow due to postmenopausal atrophy...|$|R
50|$|Still {{searching for}} victory in 2001, Petree kept Nemechek in the #33 and hired Bobby Hamilton {{to drive the}} #55. A 3rd team with Geoff Bodine driving made one start in 2000, but the deal fell through. It {{would turn out to}} be Petree's best season yet.

After multiple lead changes, Hamilton took the lead as he took the white flag and held off Tony Stewart to win Petree's first career race. Hamilton would earn 6 more top-10s and 18th in the final 2001 rundown. For Nemechek, the season was mixed. While practicing at Dover Downs, Nemechek slammed the wall, and injured his leg. Luckily, Hamilton's son, Bobby Hamilton Jr. was more than willing to join his father. Hamilton Jr. ran 3 races, Wally Dallenbach Jr. ran at Pocono, and Scott Pruett took over at Sears Point (now Sonoma). When Nemechek came back, his season was not the best and before October was over he announced his plans to leave.

40|$|Both bolt {{profile shape}} and profile spacing (rib spacing) {{have been found}} to {{influence}} the bonding capacity of the grouted rock bolt. The bolt surface profile configuration has greater importance to rock bolt than the steel rebar used in civil engineering construction, because the rock bolt is subjected to greater dynamic loading than the steel rebar. The increased bonding capacity of bolts is important when supported ground is either heavily fractured, faulted or the supported ground is of soft formation, typically that of coal measure rocks. Past laboratory studies have identified the bolt profile spacing as of significant relevance to bolt resin rock bonding increase, however, no attempt has been made to determine the optimum spacing between the bolt profiles spacing.

60|$|Henrietta thought not indeed {{when she}} looked over a gate leading into the farm-yard on the side {{opposite}} to the great old barn, raised on a multitude of stone posts, a short ladder reaching to the wide doors which were folded back so as to display the heaps of straw thrown violently back and forward; the dogs now standing in attitudes of ecstatic expectation, tail straight out, head bent forward, now springing in rapture on the prey; the boys rushing about with their huge sticks, and coming down now and then with thundering blows, the labourers with their white shirt <b>sleeves</b> and pitchforks <b>pulling</b> down the straw, Uncle Roger with a portentous-looking club {{in the thick of}} the fight.

60|$|Sotillo {{had taken}} up his {{quarters}} on the upper floor in a vast apartment with heavy black beams. But there was no ceiling, and the eye lost itself in the darkness under the high pitch of the roof. The thick shutters stood open. On a long table could be seen a large inkstand, some stumpy, inky quill pens, and two square wooden boxes, each holding half a hundred-weight of sand. Sheets of grey coarse official paper bestrewed the floor. It {{must have been a}} room occupied by some higher official of the Customs, because a large leathern armchair stood behind the table, with other high-backed chairs scattered about. A net hammock was swung under one of the beams--for the official's afternoon siesta, no doubt. A couple of candles stuck into tall iron candlesticks gave a dim reddish light. The colonel's hat, sword, and revolver lay between them, and a couple of his more trusty officers lounged gloomily against the table. The colonel threw himself into the armchair, and a big negro with a sergeant's stripes on his ragged <b>sleeve,</b> kneeling down, <b>pulled</b> off his boots. Sotillo's ebony moustache contrasted violently with the livid colouring of his cheeks. His eyes were sombre and as if sunk very far into his head. He seemed exhausted by his perplexities, languid with disappointment; but when the sentry on the landing thrust his head in to announce the arrival of a prisoner, he revived at once.|$|R
40|$|Sportsmen with {{overhead}} activities {{very frequently}} {{have an increased}} mobility of the shoulder joints. Thus {{it is often difficult}} to distinguish between stability, hyperlaxity, and instability of the joint. Repeated extreme movements strain static stabilizers and lead to their lengthening. The principal problem in sporters is to establish a balance between the mobility and stability of the shoulder joint. Clinical examinations and the following treatment should be focused not only on pain but also on the stability of the glenohumeral joint. We can encounter a whole range of possibilities from glenohumeral instability to the impingement syndrome. We often find a narrowing of the subacromial space in so-called tennis shoulder (rotation of the scapula and relative abduction of the humerus). A helpful therapeutic solution of this problem should be provided by a bandage of our own new construction. The shoulder bandage consists of an upper arm sleeve and an elastic strap leading across the axilla and fixed around the chest. If the upper extremity is free in adduction, there is no tension to the sleeve but in the moment of abduction, the elastic strap is gradually stretched and the <b>sleeve</b> <b>pulls</b> the proximal humerus down. Greater elevation and greater tension can be modified by the tightening or lengthening of the elastic strap. On the one hand the bandage causes broadening of the subacromial space, on the other hand muscle activity is modified and a higher muscle tonus increasingly stabilizes the joint. This paper describes the effect of the bandage from different points of view – orthopedic, biomechanical, and imaging. A group of 25 patients is evaluated. The feeling of an increased stability of the shoulder is described by 16 sporters and minimizing of pain by using the bandage is reported by 13 sporters. Constraining of locomotion in the edge position is claimed by 18 persons and decreasing of performance resulting from a slowed up lifting of the arm is declared by 16 persons. 9 sporters use the bandage regularly, 8 use it only in case of problems, 6 persons stopped using it after remission of acute complaints, 2 persons claim no effect of the bandage. The shoulder bandage increases glenohumeral stability, minimizes the risk of injuring the rotator cuff, reduces the risk of impingement syndrome, alleviates or even eliminates the pain in elevation and in extreme positions of the upper arm. It enables sporters to continue sports activities without the risk of worsening a pathological condition. Autoři předkládají první výsledky léčby impingement syndromu u sportovců léčených konzervativně pomocí ortézy vlastní konstrukce, s distálním elastickým tahem. Ramenní ortéza byla naložena u 25 pacientů – sportovců s diagnózou impingement syndromu. Byl sledován vliv na bolestivost, závažnost omezení rozsahu pohybu a změnu biomechaniky pletence ramenního. Dále schopnost zvýšit stabilitu glenohumerálního skloubení a subjektivní pocit sportujícího pacienta. Nový typ ortézy spočívá v netradičním pojetí konstrukce. Krátký rukáv, který je z elastického materiálu, je natažen na proximální paži. Pomocí pružného gumového tahu je fixován k hrudní stěně. Pokud horní končetina volně visí, není žádný tah za fixovanou pažní manžetu. V okamžiku elevace končetiny dochází k postupnému napínání gumového tahu a manžeta stahuje proximální paži směrem distálním. Čím větší je elevace končetiny, tím větší je tah distálním směrem a odlehčení subacromiálního prostoru. Tah je možno modifikovat přitažením nebo uvolněním upnutí fixace na hrudní stěnu. Subjektivně udávané zlepšení bolestivosti při sportu je u 23 pacientů, ve dvou případech nemá ortéza žádný efekt. Subjektivní pocit zpevnění ramene a zvýšení stability prokazujeme u 16 sportovců. Pocit omezení hybnosti v krajní poloze udává 18 jedinců. Pocit snížení výkonnosti v důsledku zpomaleného nápřahu je u 16 jedinců. Potřeba nezbytnosti užití ortézy na sport je u 6 jedinců, 9 používá ortézu intermitentně, 8 po odeznění akutních potíží ortézu odložilo, 2 pro nulový efekt nepoužívají. Vzhledem k tomu, že se jedná o zcela nový charakter bandáže, nelze komparovat se zkušenostmi v literatuře. Ortéza distalizuje hlavici humeru. Snižuje riziko vzniku zvýšeného tlaku subakromiálně při elevaci paže nad horizontálu a tím rozvoje (primárního) impingement syndromu. Působí jako agonista m. supraspinatus, který je primárním depresorem hlavice pažní kosti. Současně snižuje nároky na šlachu dlouhé hlavy bicepsu a snižuje napětí dolního glenohumerálního vazu. Ortéza svým tahem snižuje riziko poranění manžety rotátorů o distální stranu korakoakromiálního oblouku a snižuje riziko vzniku sekundárního impingement syndromu. Proti vzniku sekundárního impingement syndromu působí i tlakem přenášejícím se přes pažní kost do jamky glenohumerálního skloubení. Zvyšuje se stabilita kloubu a snižuje riziko translačních poloh hlavice humeru. Současně dvojím mechanismem dochází ke zvýšení svalového tonu v oblasti pletence pažního. Jednak aktivním překonáváním odporu při elevaci paže nad horizontálu jsou svaly nuceny ke zvýšené aktivitě, dále již samotné naložení bandáže mechanismem modifikace proprioceptívní inervace – trvalé dráždění exteroreceptorů bandáží vyvolá senzorické vzruchy v aferentních neuronech jdoucích do zadních provazců míšních, interneurony vybaví vzruchy v motoneuronech jednoho čí více segmentů a dojde k reflexní odpovědi, slabé dráždění a opakované podněty pak vedou ke zvýšení svalového tonu resp. k tonické reflexní odpovědi (reflexní činnost na úrovni míchy). Zvýšený tonus periskapulárních svalů i zvýšený tlak hlavice humeru proti lopatce současně snižuje riziko rozvoje skapulotorakální instability. Bandáž ramena s distálním tahem umožní pokračovat ve sportovní aktivitě bez rizika prohlubování impingement syndromu, zvýší stabilitu glenohumerálního skloubení, zmírní až odstraní algie v elevaci paže snížením tlaku v subacromiálním prostoru...|$|R
