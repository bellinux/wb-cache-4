50|$|Podocarpus are {{evergreen}} woody plants. They {{are generally}} trees {{but may also}} be shrubs. The trees can reach a height of 40 meters at their tallest. Some shrubby species have a decumbent growth habit. The primary branches form pseudo-whorls around the trunk. The bark can be scaly or fibrous and peeling with vertical <b>strips.</b> <b>Terminal</b> buds are distinctive with bud scales that are often imbricate and can be spreading.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Terminal</b> <b>strip</b> construction, {{which is}} often {{referred}} to as point-to-point construction within the tube guitar amplifier community, uses <b>terminal</b> <b>strips</b> (also called [...] "tag boards"). A <b>terminal</b> <b>strip</b> has stamped tin-plated copper terminals, each with a hole through which wire ends could be pushed, fitted on an insulating strip, usually made of a cheap, heat-resistant material such as synthetic-resin bonded paper (FR-2), or bakelite reinforced with cotton. The insulator has an integral mounting bracket, sometimes electrically connected to one or more of the stamped loops to ground them to the chassis.|$|R

50|$|Since February 2009, {{construction}} was completed on Grand Central Parkway, {{with the exception}} of the station themselves. Construction was still ongoing along Casino Center Boulevard and 3rd St. The route is set to use a dedicated lane from Grand Central to Imperial/3rd St. From that point, it is to operate in mixed flow travel, with special stations built along the route. It is expected to terminate at the South <b>Strip</b> Transfer <b>Terminal.</b>|$|R
40|$|A five-step {{technique}} for microswitch manufacture is described: (1) A clad board is inlaid with a precious metal {{and the board}} is pressed. (2) One end of the fixed contact containing a precious metal inlay section is curved, and this edge of the precious metal inlay section becomes a fixed contact. (3) Inserts are formed in the unit body and <b>terminal</b> <b>strips</b> are placed through {{the top and bottom}} of the base and held. (4) The unit body is held by the base and the sequential contact strips are cut off. (5) Movable stripes are attached to the support of the <b>terminal</b> <b>strips</b> on the movable side and movable contacts are placed opposite the fixed contacts...|$|R

50|$|In March 2010 a new bus {{rapid transit}} line {{connecting}} the Strip to downtown Las Vegas and Town Square and the South <b>Strip</b> Transfer <b>Terminal</b> became operational. This new 11 mile service was called ACE Gold Line and {{is similar to the}} Metropolitan Area Express BRT Line which has been operating since June 30, 2004. Due to a lawsuit by Ace Cab, the line was rebranded as the Gold Line. On November 7, 2010, it was rebranded {{to be known as the}} Strip and Downtown Express (SDX).|$|R
50|$|If {{parasitic}} {{effects are}} significant, point-to-point and <b>terminal</b> <b>strip</b> wiring have the disadvantage {{compared to a}} PCB of indeterminate parasitic components; while the inductance and capacitance due to a PCB are {{the same for all}} samples, values may vary between point-to-point wired units, changing circuit operation.|$|R
50|$|On February 25, 1953, the Sudbury Airport Committee {{was formed}} to lobby and arrange for {{commercial}} flights to Sudbury. A second landing <b>strip</b> and a <b>terminal</b> building had to be built and construction of these were completed in 1955. Regular commercial air service began on February 1, 1954, by Trans-Canada Air Lines.|$|R
50|$|Sweepstakes parlors {{are most}} often located in or {{adjacent}} to <b>strip</b> malls. Computer <b>terminals</b> are set up inside the parlors, where patrons can see if they have won a prize by playing a casino-style game, similar to a video slot machine. The decor of the cafes may also include casino-inspired elements and motifs.|$|R
50|$|When Hamas {{took over}} the Gaza <b>Strip,</b> the <b>terminal</b> was closed by the Israeli authorities. The {{previous}} operators, who were affiliated with Fatah, have fled to the West Bank. Hamas has offered to bring Fatah back to Karni or hire a Turkish company to operate the Palestinian side, but Israel persistently refused to deal with Hamas, the de facto authority in the Gaza Strip. In June 2007, the UNWRA coordinator commended the IDF on moving humanitarian shipments to the secondary Kerem Shalom and Sufa crossings, and hoped that Karni could be reopened {{as part of a}} longer-term solution.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2010, RTC {{introduced}} the ACE branding for its {{bus rapid transit}} offerings. The first ACE route was the ACE Gold Line, connecting downtown Las Vegas, the Las Vegas Convention Center, the Strip, and the South <b>Strip</b> Transfer <b>Terminal.</b> In addition, ACEXpress was introduced as branding for its express bus service, with an express bus line connecting the Centennial Hills neighborhood northwest of the city with downtown Las Vegas, the Center Strip, and UNLV. In May 2010, RTC rebranded its lines away from the [...] "ACE" [...] name due to a lawsuit from Ace Cab, a local Las Vegas taxi operator.|$|R
40|$|The work {{described}} {{here is an}} attempt to improve an electronic <b>stripping</b> for <b>terminal</b> sectors, VertiDigi, in order to design a version dedicated to the Planning Controller (PC). A brief description of the existing tool is done, as well as its design principles. Past experiments are then evoked. They confirm the good acceptability of the tool for clearance input, but also show the emergence of a specific issue: the Flight Integration Process (FIP). This process includes all the mental, physical and manipulation processes that take place between the announcement of a flight and the actual call from the pilot on the radio frequency. A field observation survey was conducted i...|$|R
5000|$|The South <b>Strip</b> Transfer <b>Terminal</b> (or [...] "SSTT"), {{owned by}} the RTC, is located just south of McCarran Airport on Sunset Rd. and Gilespie St. The SSTT was opened in 2003 after the Vacation Village hotel and casino was closed, which was the {{southern}} terminus for many CAT routes. The SSTT has 18 transit bays that are serviced by 8 RTC routes & Megabus, which began on December 12, 2012, providing service from the SSTT to Los Angeles via Riverside. In 2008 the Park & Ride lot was expanded, doubling the amount of spaces available {{in response to the}} overwhelming use of the lot by commuters heading to the airport.|$|R

50|$|Early speaker cable was {{typically}} stranded copper wire, insulated with cloth tape, waxed paper or rubber. For portable applications, common lampcord was used, twisted in pairs for mechanical reasons. Cables were often soldered {{in place at}} one end. Other terminations were binding posts, <b>terminal</b> <b>strips,</b> and spade lugs for crimp connections. Two-conductor Â¼-inch tip-sleeve phone jacks came into use in the 1920s and '30s as convenient terminations.|$|R
50|$|The Euroblock is a {{solderless}} connector {{that uses}} screw terminals to clamp connecting wires. Once the wires are installed, the entire assembly is plugged into a matching socket {{in the electronic}} device. Euroblocks are more convenient than the <b>terminal</b> <b>strips</b> they replace as the signal cables can be quickly disconnected from or connected to the electronic device, rather than unscrewing and re-screwing each wire individually.|$|R
25|$|RTC Transit (previously Citizens Area Transit, or CAT) {{provides}} {{bus service}} on the Strip with double decker buses known as The Deuce. The Deuce runs between Mandalay Bay {{at the southern end}} of the Strip (and to the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign and South <b>Strip</b> Transfer <b>Terminal</b> after midnight) to the Bonneville Transit Center (BTC) and the Fremont Street Experience in Downtown Las Vegas, with stops near every casino. RTC also operates an express bus called the Strip and Downtown Express (SDX). This route connects the Strip to the Las Vegas Convention Center and Downtown Las Vegas to the north, with stops at selected hotels and shopping attractions (Las Vegas Premium Outlets North & South).|$|R
50|$|RTC Transit Route(s) 113 (and the MAX, before February 2016, {{when it was}} decommissioned) {{serves the}} road from Downtown Las Vegas north to Nellis Air Force Base, The Deuce serves the Road from Downtown Las Vegas south to Mandalay Bay (except from 12:30am local time to 9:00am local time where it {{continues}} further south to the South <b>Strip</b> Transfer <b>Terminal</b> (SSTT)). South of Circus Circus, along side it runs the SDX (Strip & Downtown Express) which runs from 9am to 12:30am as a limited stop express line. Route 117 serves the road south from the SSTT past the Las Vegas Premium Outlet South store, the South Point Casino and Silverado Ranch Blvd.|$|R
2500|$|In 1928, the Los Angeles City Council {{selected}} [...] in {{the southern}} part of Westchester for a new airport. The fields of wheat, barley and lima beans were converted into dirt landing <b>strips</b> without any <b>terminal</b> buildings. It was named Mines Field for William W.

50|$|In {{the early}} days of radio, amateurs nailed bare copper wires or <b>terminal</b> <b>strips</b> to a wooden board (often {{literally}} a board to slice bread on) and soldered electronic components to them. Sometimes a paper schematic diagram was first glued to the board as a guide to placing terminals, then components and wires were installed over their symbols on the schematic. Using thumbtacks or small nails as mounting posts was also common.|$|R
50|$|In 1928, the Los Angeles City Council {{selected}} 640 acre in {{the southern}} part of Westchester for a new airport.

50|$|Point-to-point and <b>terminal</b> <b>strip</b> {{construction}} {{continued to}} be used for some vacuum tube equipment even after the introduction of printed circuit boards. The heat of the tubes can degrade the circuit boards and cause them to become brittle and break. Circuit board degradation is often seen on inexpensive tube radios produced in the 1960s, especially around the hot output and rectifier tubes. American manufacturer Zenith continued to use point-to-point wiring in its tube-based television sets until the early 1970s.|$|R
