[...] Instead he tells us that we must first determine whether our terms refer or not before we know {{the proper way to}} understand them. [...] However, Czesław Lejewski criticizes this belief for reducing the matter to empirical discovery when it <b>seems</b> <b>we</b> should have a formal distinction between referring and non-referring terms or elements of our domain.

2500|$|The {{presidency}} banks dominated banking in India {{but there}} were also some exchange banks and a number of Indian joint stock banks. All these banks operated in different segments of the economy. The exchange banks, mostly owned by Europeans, concentrated on financing foreign trade. Indian joint stock banks were generally under capitalised and lacked the experience and maturity to compete with the presidency and exchange banks. This segmentation let Lord Curzon to observe, [...] "In respect of banking it <b>seems</b> <b>we</b> are behind the times. We are like some old fashioned sailing ship, divided by solid wooden bulkheads into separate and cumbersome compartments." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2006, the {{unofficial}} website reported that The League of Gentlemen were to 'reunite' {{at the beginning}} of 2007, most likely to plan for the fourth series. Shearsmith and Pemberton appeared on The Russell Brand Show on 22 December 2006. When asked [...] "Will there be any more of The League of Gentlemen?", Shearsmith simply replied [...] "Yes" [...] but was quick to change the subject and not reveal anything about a new series. On the official website, Shearsmith's blog entry for 23 May 2007 stated that the troupe had recently met up in London's West End: [...] "We discussed our next project - it <b>seems</b> <b>we</b> have hit upon something. Early days - but exciting nevertheless." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Moving Behind Woman, who {{was about}} 14 {{at the time of}} the Washita attack, Black Kettle's wife Medicine Woman stood outside the lodge for a long time. She was angry that the camp was not moving that night, saying, [...] "I don't like this delay, we could have moved long ago. The Agent sent word for us to leave at once. It <b>seems</b> <b>we</b> are crazy and deaf, and cannot hear." [...] Black Hawk's brother White Shield (also known as Gentle Horse) had a vision of a wolf wounded on the right side of its head {{mourning}} its little ones which had been scattered and killed by a powerful enemy. He tried to persuade Black Kettle to move camp immediately, but was unsuccessful. [...] But five of Black Kettle's children (four daughters and a son) moved to the camp of Black Kettle's nephew Whirlwind, which was ten miles downriver (five miles straight-line distance).|$|E
2500|$|... "Today it <b>seems</b> <b>we</b> can {{be reunited}} in a will for peace that may express the {{aspirations}} of our country... Since already several years, a compromise peace, a peace negotiated with the opponent seemed to me commanded by the facts, while it commanded, in return, to put back in order our finances, the recovery of our economy and its expansion. Because this war placed on our country an unbearable burden. And here appears today a new and formidable threat: if the Indochina conflict is not resolved — and settled very fast — it is the risk of war, of international war and maybe atomic, that we must foresee. It is because I wanted a better peace that I wanted it earlier, when we had more assets. But even now there is some renouncings or abandons that the situation does not comprise. France {{does not have to}} accept and will not accept settlement which would be incompatible with its more vital interests [...] France will remain present in Far-Orient. Neither our allies, nor our opponents must conserve the least doubt on the signification of our determination. A negotiation has been engaged in Geneva... I have longly studied the report... consulted the most qualified military and diplomatic experts. My conviction that a pacific settlement of the conflict is possible has been confirmed. A [...] "cease-fire" [...] must henceforth intervene quickly. The government which I will form will fix itself — and will fix to its opponents — a delay of 4 weeks to reach it. We are today on 17th of June. I will present myself before you before the 20th of July... If no satisfying solution has been reached at this date, you will be freed from the contract which would have tied us together, and my government will give its dismissal to the President of the Republic." ...|$|E
