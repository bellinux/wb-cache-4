40|$|As the {{email system}} {{is widely used}} as a {{communication}} channel, and often is crucial {{for the performance of}} organizations, it is important that users can trust the content of what is being delivered to them. A standard called DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) has been developed by the IETF to solve the problem with authentication and integrity, by using digital signatures. This master's thesis goal is to evaluate the solution where an implementation of DKIM is extended with DNSSEC validation. DNSSEC is a solution which secures, among other, the mapping between IP addresses and domain names. The implementation of DKIM is deployed and evaluated with function testing, domain testing, threat analysis, and interoperability testing. DKIM does not need any new public-key infrastructure, thus inflicting less cost on the deployment compared with other cryptographic solutions such as S/MIME and PGP. We recommended to use DKIM together with DNSSEC to secure the transportation of the DKIM public key. The upcoming standard ADSP can inform the recipient of whether a domain is signing its email or not and thereby a possibility to detect any unauthorized signature removal. A further problem is that mailing lists often manipulate the email, thus breaking the signature. We therefore recommend to send email directly to the recipient or active DKIM <b>signing</b> on <b>the</b> <b>mailing</b> lists...|$|R

40|$|HYPERION {{is a new}} {{three-dimensional}} dust continuum Monte-Carlo {{radiative transfer}} code {{that is designed to}} be as generic as possible, allowing radiative transfer to be computed through a variety of three-dimensional grids. The main part of the code is problem-independent, and only requires an arbitrary three-dimensional density structure, dust properties, the position and properties of the illuminating sources, and parameters controlling the running and output of the code. HYPERION is parallelized, and is shown to scale well to thousands of processes. Two common benchmark models for protoplanetary disks were computed, and the results are found to be in excellent agreement with those from other codes. Finally, to demonstrate the capabilities of the code, dust temperatures, SEDs, and synthetic multi-wavelength images were computed for a dynamical simulation of a low-mass star formation region. HYPERION is being actively developed to include new features, and is publicly available ([URL] Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics.

40|$|We {{surveyed}} 470 Amazon. com merchants {{regarding their}} experience, knowledge {{and perceptions of}} digitally-signed email. Some of these merchants (93) had been receiving digitally-signed VAT invoices from Amazon {{for more than a}} year. Respondents attitudes were measured as to <b>the</b> role of <b>signed</b> and/or sealed mail in e-commerce. Among our findings: 25. 2 % of merchants thought that receipts sent by online merchants should be digitally-signed, 13. 2 % thought they should be sealed with encryption, and 33. 6 % thought that they should be both signed and sealed. Statistically-significant differences between merchants who had received <b>the</b> <b>signed</b> <b>mail</b> and those who had not are noted. We conclude that Internet-based merchants should send digitally-signed email as a "best practice," even if they think that their customers will not understand the signatures, on the grounds that today's email systems handle such signatures automatically and the passive exposure to signatures appears to increase acceptance and trust...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{states have}} process serving laws {{that govern the}} way service of process is effected, the {{licensing}} requirements to effect service, the forms to be used and the time deadlines that service of process may be accomplished upon individual respondents and corporations. These differences may be vast. For example, in New York, service of process may require licensing of the process server; in Pennsylvania, process may only be served by the sheriff or a sheriff's deputy in most cases (except in Philadelphia, where process may be served [...] "by any competent adult"); and in New Jersey, process is effected if, after making an affidavit that diligent efforts to effect personal service had failed, the party sends two copies of <b>the</b> pleading by <b>mail</b> - one by regular mail and one by certified mail, return receipt requested - and either <b>the</b> certified <b>mail</b> receipt is returned <b>signed</b> or <b>the</b> certified <b>mail</b> envelope is returned unclaimed and <b>the</b> regular <b>mail</b> is not returned to the sender. Generally, there are specific procedures and rules for most courts, from local small claims courts to United States District courts. Each court has specific rules, forms, guidelines and procedures which must be followed in order to successfully effect service of process. Failure to follow these guidelines may deem the attempted service improper. Indeed, many defendants in court hearings use the affirmative defense of [...] "I was not served" [...] as an often successful line of defense in any lawsuit. Not surprisingly, this defense tends {{to be effective in}} many cases because service of process upon defendant did not follow legal procedure. As for United States federal courts, service of process rules are in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, upon which most state service of process laws are based.|$|R

50|$|Email {{messages}} are composed, delivered, {{and stored in}} a multiple step process, which starts with the message's composition. When the user finishes composing the message and sends it, the message {{is transformed into a}} standard format: an RFC 2822 formatted message. Afterwards, the message can be transmitted. Using a network connection, <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> client, referred to as a mail user agent (MUA), connects to a mail transfer agent (MTA) operating on <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> server. <b>The</b> <b>mail</b> client then provides the sender’s identity to the server. Next, using <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> server commands, <b>the</b> client sends the recipient list to <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> server. <b>The</b> client then supplies the message. Once <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> server receives and processes the message, several events occur: recipient server identification, connection establishment, and message transmission. Using Domain Name System (DNS) services, <b>the</b> sender’s <b>mail</b> server determines <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> server(s) for <b>the</b> recipient(s). Then, the server opens up a connection(s) to <b>the</b> recipient <b>mail</b> server(s) and sends the message employing a process similar to that used by the originating client, delivering the message to the recipient(s).|$|R
