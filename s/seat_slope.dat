40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore the effect of a forward sloping seat on posture and muscular activity of the trunk and lower limbs. To this aim, twelve asymptomatic participants were tested in six conditions varying <b>seat</b> <b>slope</b> (0 °, 15 ° forward) and height (high, medium, low). Angular position of head, trunk and pelvis was assessed with an inertial orientation system, and muscular activity of 11 superficial postural muscles located in the trunk and lower limbs was estimated using normalized EMG. Results showed that a forward sloping seat, compared to a flat seat, induced a greater activity of the soleus (p< 0. 01), vastus later-alis (p< 0. 05) and vastus medialis (p< 0. 05), as well a lower hip flexion (p< 0. 01). In contrast, no significant variation of head, trunk and pelvis angular position was observed according to <b>seat</b> <b>slope.</b> It was concluded that forward sloping seats increase the load sustained by the lower limbs, without a systematic improvement of body posture...|$|E

30|$|One {{review of}} sitting posture {{suggests}} that intervertebral disk pressure and postural muscle activity is minimised {{in a chair}} with lumbar support, whose back slopes at 120 ° and whose <b>seat</b> <b>slopes</b> upward by up to 10 degrees (Harrison et al. 1999). It is clear from our spirometric data that reclining significantly reduces both vital capacity and forced vital capacity. The brass musicians found trying {{to play in this}} posture very uncomfortable so to avoid any risk of injury, we reduced the slope of the chair back for experiment 2. Standing in a stooped position or sitting on a backless seat in a forward slumped posture also reduces activity in the lateral abdominal muscles compared to standing (O’Sullivan et al. 2002; Snijders et al. 1995) and our experiences with upward <b>sloping</b> <b>seats</b> (which also bring the angle between thigh and trunk to below 90 °) suggest that this will reduce both vital capacity and forced vital capacity.|$|R

Mod 6 relined Mod 2 with a uniform twist rifling along with a modified new chase hoop and locking ring. Mod 7 took the Mod 3 and used a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling, and added a tube and liner locking ring. Mod 8 was the Mod 0 or Mod 4 also using a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling that was secured by a tube and liner locking ring with a liner locking collar at the breech end. The Mod 8s that used Mod 0 guns also added a new chase hoop and locking ring. Mod 9 was a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearances at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and liner locking ring and collar added at the breech end. Mod 10, like the Mod 9, was also a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearance at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and liner locking ring and collar added at the breech end. The Mod 10 used Breech Mechanism Mark 9 instead of the Mark 8 on the previous Mods. Mod 11 was a Mod 7 that had the chamber lengthened, adding , and a 3½° breech band <b>seating</b> <b>slope</b> and used Breech Mechanism Mark 12.

These mass movements result in several types of deep- <b>seated</b> <b>slope</b> failures, {{depending on the type of}} movement, lithological, structural, and geotechnical conditions and the water saturation of the landslide material. This thesis presents broad set of various methods of geomorphology, geophysics, engineering geology, dendrogeomorphology and geodesy in an attempt to fully understand the problem of slope failures in the Jezeří area located at the boundary between the Krušné Hory Mountains and the Most Basin (Czech Republic). An interdisciplinary approach has enabled an in-depth review of both the dynamics and development of recent slope failures as well as morphology and structure of slope failures. There are two sectors - Southeast and Southwest - with different types of slope failures. In the Southwest sector, mass movements occur in thick colluvial mantle and weathered Tertiary claystones. The main factors influencing their development include rainfall culminations, groundwater flowing from the valley of Šramnický Brook and [...] ...|$|R

30|$|Though {{spirometry}} {{requires a}} different type of breathing than brass playing (i.e. there is no resistance to exhalation) it nonetheless removes a number of confounding factors such as differences in the in the way particular instruments are supported, and isolates the potential influence of posture alone. One widely used pedagogic text on breathing in brass players suggests that sitting “seriously reduces the expansion area of the thorax” (Steenstrup 2004). While we did not observe any difference in the degree of thoracic expansion, the spirit of this idea may be supported by the significant or near significant reduction in vital capacity, forced vital capacity and maximum note duration when sitting on a flat or <b>sloping</b> <b>seat</b> compared to standing. However this amounted to a few percent at most and so is unlikely to {{have a major impact on}} performance. The widely held notion (Frederiksen 1996; Steenstrup 2004) that it is possible by sitting erect to create a lumbar posture that is comparable to standing (as sitting on a downward <b>sloping</b> <b>seat</b> was intended to do in our study) and that this is reflected in breathing patterns, was not upheld for spirometry or for moderate playing tasks carried out by the students, but when playing at high intensity, using a <b>sloping</b> <b>seat</b> may create a situation that is truly intermediate between sitting on a flat seat and standing.|$|R

30|$|Many {{pedagogical}} {{accounts of}} breathing in brass players discuss {{the effect of}} different standing and sitting postures and though numerous opinions have been expressed about this (Frederiksen 1996; Gordon 1987; Snell 1988; Steenstrup 2004), none {{has so far been}} based on experimental evidence. It is often suggested that when standing, vital capacity is greater and breathing movements more free than when sitting i.e. that during inspiration particularly, they require less effort (Steenstrup 2004). If the player does use a chair, they are often instructed to sit “as if you are standing” (Frederiksen 1996) though they may be warned not to sit too erect (Farkas 1956). The type of chair used also has an effect on posture which can in turn have an impact on breathing. It is now quite common for orchestral musicians (including wind players), to play on <b>seats</b> that <b>slope</b> down towards the front in order to improve comfort, particularly when playing for long periods (Horvath 2010; Paull and Harrison 1997). While some modern orchestral chairs have been ergonomically designed to incorporate a degree of slope, the chairs that players are most often presented with do not, and they may therefore adapt them by using wedge shaped cushions or by putting blocks under the back legs. Sitting on a flat seat, reduces or even reverses lumbar lordosis and the rationale for using a <b>sloping</b> <b>seat</b> is the belief that this will restore lumbar curvature to a conformation that more closely resembles standing thus reducing intervertebral disk pressure (see Watson 2009). Whether this can be achieved with the degree of slope that can be readily attained on the platform is rarely discussed; furthermore there has been little consideration of what effect <b>sloping</b> <b>seats</b> might have on breathing. This is the object of the present investigation.|$|R

For the study of large slope instability and deep <b>seated</b> <b>slope</b> gravitational deformations in the Susa and Aosta Valleys (Western Italian Alps) a complete multiscale program (spatial and temporal) analysis has been performed, giving contributions to the reconstruction and settings of their possible evolution. A complex geodatabase has been created, including thematic elements from field-data collection (geomorphology, hydrology, lithology, structural geology) and instability events analysis from data archives and remote sensing images. To facilitate the management of {{a large amount of}} collected data a G. I. S. (Geographical Information System) has been developed, including two main levels of information: local and regional. Local information is mainly devoted to detailed geothematic mapping of single instability phenomena. Clot Brun case study is presented, where original and derived landslide features have been elaborated through arithmetical and statistical operations, in order to identify different instability zones and to assess displacements and state of activity through-time. Regional information collected for a landslide inventory of Aosta Valley (IFFI project) summarizes historical and remote sensing data, combined with metadata from local analysis, in order to assess spatial and temporal hazards. To avoid problems of data accuracy (quality and positioning) due to different source archives, a semi-automatic system for selection and validation of data has been created, based on their spatial characteristics (buffer analysis and control).
