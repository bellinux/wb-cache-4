2500|$|Inside Soap Kate White later {{focused on}} Michael, {{saying that she}} could [...] "easily believe the worst of Michael Moon."

[...] She noted that Michael is the only suspect who has previously been involved with Kat, and that it was an emotional affair, rather than just a fling, so with Alfie being distant and Janine pushing Michael away, White said [...] "we don't reckon it would take much for these two to start seeing each other again." [...] She said that Michael has the means, unlike some of the others, as he got Janine to tear up their prenuptial agreement before they married, and the flat that Kat's lover obtained could be listed on the books of Janine's property management business, Butcher's Joints. However, White went on to say, [...] "something tells us Kat would find it very difficult to live with herself if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> with a man whose baby is in a bad way. It seems too cruel for a mother who went though the agony of thinking she'd lost her child, so we're not sure at could cause another mum that degree of heartache. Then again, that other woman is Kat's loathed enemy, Janine." [...] Shepherd said that Kat and Michael had [...] "nice chemistry" [...] and opined that Michael [...] "would have been very keen" [...] on a relationship with Kat, that [...] "the opportunity for Michael and Kat to team up has always been there, from the moment he arrived" [...] and that the writers are placed [...] "lots of little hints to insinuate that it could be Michael".
