In the present study, we have generated canine SULT 1 D 1 (cSULT 1 D 1) variants with mutations at amino acid residues in the substrate-binding pocket [A 146 E (Ala- 146 [...] >Glu), A 146 D, A 146 Q, I 86 D or D 247 L]. These mutation sites were chosen with regard to their possible contribution to the marked dopamine/PNP preference of cSULT 1 D 1. After characterization, we found that the overall sulphation efficiencies for the cSULT 1 D 1 A 146 and the I 86 mutants were strongly decreased for both substrates compared with wild-type cSULT 1 D 1 but the substrate preference was unchanged.

40|$|A form of sulphotransferase {{capable of}} <b>sulphating</b> {{dehydroepiandrosterone}} and other steroids was purified from cytosol prepared from human liver. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphotransferase was purified 621 -fold {{when compared with}} the activity in cytosol using DEAE-Sepharose CL- 6 B and adenosine 3 ', 5 '-bisphosphate-agarose affinity chromatography. During affinity chromatography, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphation activity could be resolved from p-nitrophenol sulphation activity catalysed by phenol sulphotransferase by using a gradient of adenosine 3 '-phosphate 5 '-phosphosulphate. The purified enzyme was most active towards dehydroepiandrosterone but was capable of conjugating a number of other steroids, including pregnenolone, androsterone and beta-oestradiol. No activity towards p-nitrophenol or dopamine, substrates for the phenol sulphotransferase, was observed with the pure enzyme.

40|$|The {{catalytic}} partial oxidation (CPO) {{of methane}} over precious metal catalyst {{has been shown}} to be an attractive way to obtain syngas (CO and H 2) or H 2 which can be converted to clean fuels by Fischer–Tropsch synthesis or employed in fuel cells. However, the presence of sulphur bearing compounds naturally occurring in the fuel, or added as odorants to pipe-line natural gas (approximately up to 10 ppm), can have a detrimental effect on the CPO activity. In this work the effect of sulphur addition on the catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) of methane in the low to moderate temperature regime (300 - 800 °C) and under self-sustained high temperature (> 800 °C) condition was investigated on Rh-based catalysts supported on either La 2 O 3 or SiO 2 stabilised γ-Al 2 O 3. Based on the results of catalytic activity measurements and in-situ FT-IR/DRIFT spectroscopic characterisation, as well as TPR/TPD studies, it has been shown that the presence of sulphur can severely suppress the formation of synthesis gas by inhibiting the steam reforming (SR) reactions during the CPO of methane. It was demonstrated that the support material plays a crucial role in the CPO of methane in the low to moderate temperature regime. In the presence of a <b>sulphating</b> support such as La 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 the partial oxidation reaction was much less inhibited than a less <b>sulphating</b> support such as SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3. The <b>sulphating</b> support acts as a sulphur storage reservoir, which minimises the poison from adsorbing on or near the active Rh sites where reactions take place. However under the typical operating conditions of methane CPO i. e. at high temperatures and short contact times over structured reactors, sulphur in the feed inhibits the SR reaction by directly poisoning the active Rh sites thus preventing the sulphur storage capacity of the support from showing any beneficial effect on the S-tolerance. Both steady state and transient operation of the CPO reactor were investigated particularly with regards to poisoning/regeneration cycles and low temperature light-off phase. The analysis of products distribution in the effluent and heat balance demonstrated that sulphur reversibly adsorbed on Rh selectively inhibits the SR reaction path to syn-gas production. The extent of SR inhibition is greater when operating in air and diminishes at lower CH 4 /O 2 feed ratios. The poisoning effect was also shown to be independent from the type of sulphur bearing compound and only indirectly affected by the type of catalyst support (La 2 O 3 or SiO 2 stabilised alumina) through the value of Rh dispersion. In fact by using in situ DRIFTS experiments of adsorbed CO at room temperature it was found that sulphur acts as a selective poison by preferentially adsorbing on smaller well dispersed Rh crystallites whilst larger metallic Rh sites are mostly unaffected. The adsorption of CO at room temperature before and after S poisoning is schematically represented below. Partial substitution of Rh/La-Al 2 O 3 monolith catalysts with either Pt or Pd did not influence the way S adsorbs on highly dispersed Rh sites. Pd was found to have a detrimental effect on the overall catalytic activity and to be ineffective at improving the S-tolerance. On the other hand the partial substitution of Rh with Pt reduced the detrimental impact of S, which strongly inhibits the SR reaction on dispersed Rh sites but has a much smaller impact on Pt active sites. The improved tolerance of the bimetallic Rh-Pt catalyst against sulphur is due to its higher operating temperature related to the high oxidation activity of Pt which facilitates sulphur desorption from the catalyst and reduces its accumulation...|$|E

This paper describes the first investigation into the distribution and function of the three main classes of proteoglycans on human corneal endothelium. Immuno-gold labelling techniques were used at the light, scanning and transmission electron microscope level to localise heparan <b>sulphate,</b> chondroitin <b>sulphate</b> and keratan <b>sulphate</b> proteoglycans on human corneal endothelium. Human corneas were freeze-wounded and kept in organ culture for 3 days in order to study the distribution of proteoglycans on migrating corneal endothelium.

Labelling for chondroitin <b>sulphate</b> and heparan <b>sulphate</b> was at very low levels on normal corneal endothelium while keratan <b>sulphate</b> labelling was at high levels.

These appear to encode {{the two major}} forms of phenol sulphotransferase (PST) characterized {{in a number of}} human tissue cytosols, these being the phenolsulphating (P-PST) and monoamine-sulphating (M-PST) forms of phenol sulphotransferase. HAST 1 and HAST 3 cDNAs were functionally expressed in COS- 7 cells and kinetically characterized using the model substrates for P-PST and M-PST, p-nitrophenol and dopamine (3, 4 -dihydroxyphenethylamine) respectively. COS-expressed HAST 1 was shown to be enzymatically active in <b>sulphating</b> p-nitrophenol with high affinity (Km 0. 6 microM), whereas dopamine was the preferred substrate for HAST 3 (Km 9. 7 microM). HAST 1 could also sulphate dopamine, as could HAST 3 sulphate p-nitrophenol, but the Km for these reactions were at least two orders of magnitude greater than for the preferred substrates. COS-expressed HAST 1 and HAST 3 displayed inhibition profiles with the ST inhibitor 2, 6 -dichloro- 4 -nitrophenol (DCNP), identical with human liver cytosolic P-PST and M-PST activities respectively. Thermal-stability studies with the expressed enzymes showed that HAST 1 was considerably more thermostable (TS) than HAST 3, which is consistent with P-PST being termed the TS PST and M-PST being termed the thermolabile (TL) PST. Western immunoblot analyses of the expressed PST proteins using an antibody generated to a bacterially expressed rat liver aryl/phenol ST showed that HAST 1 and HAST 3 migrated as single proteins with different electrophoretic mobilities (32 versus 34 kDa). This is consistent with the differences in electrophoretic mobilities observed for P-PST and M-PST in a variety of tissues reported by other workers.

The following methods were found to be the most satisfactory for the detection of: Amines An extremely intense green fluorescent product was produced in sites of proteins in tissue sections treated witha methanolic solution of pyridine containing a few drops of aqueous cyanogen bromide solution (the König-Sassi reaction). Treatment of sections with an alkaline solution of salicylaldehyde gave a thermolabile, green fluorescent conjugate. Tryptophane residues gave a characteristic purple fluorescence after reaction with a solution of dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in hydrochloric acid. The complex formed by mixing solutions of Solochrome dyes and alum fluoresced red after adsorption onto acidophilic primary and polymethyl amino groups. Chloraraine T oxidised the primary amine groups of α-amino-acid residues to aldehydes which were subsequently demonstrated as their blue fluorescent salicyloylhydrasones. The specificity of the preceding reactions were confirmed by the following deamination experiments. The diazotisation of amine groups with a cold solution of sodium nitrite and sulphuric acid, followed by diazotisation with warm ethanol was usually effective, out took some time to accomplish. Oxidative deamination with a dilute solution of sodium hypochlorite within the pH range 5. 5 - 7. 0 worked very efficiently and rapidly. Stable aldehydes were produced predominantly in nuclear sites provided the excess hypochlorite in the sections was destroyed by washing them in a neutral solution of ammonia containing a trace of copper sulphate. Cytophasmic proteins were probably converted to ketoacids. If sodium thiosulphate was used for destroying the excess hypochlorite, the induced aldehydes were destroyed. Instead strongly besophillc groupings, probably derivatives of sulphonic acids, were formed in both protoplasmic and nuclear proteins. Many of the reagents suggested by Danielli (1950) for blocking amine groups were found to be ineffective. Thiols Thiols condensed with N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) selectively to give a product containing an unconjugated ketone group. The zinc complex of the non-fluorescent hydrazone of the NEM-thiol conjugate derived from salicyloyl hydrazide fluoresced bluish-green. When all the basophilic substances and compounds containing hydroxyl groups were extracted from tissue sections by treating them with methanolic hydrochloric acid at 60 Â°- 90 Â° for several hours (drastic methylation), {{it was found that the}} remaining thiol groups could be converted to basophilic thiosulphonic acids by exposing dry sections afterwards to sulphuryl chloride vapour. These acid groups exhibited an anomalous bright blue fluorescence after the treated section had been stained in dilute solutions of auramine O or acridine yellow. Disulphides Oxidation with peracids yielded basophilic sulphinic acids which were unique in resisting methylation. Subsequent staining with coriphosphine gave an intense red fluorescence in the oxidised sites. Previous blocking of other basophilic materials with methanolic thionyl chloride and of thiols with iodoacetate was essential. Phenols Indirect method. Acidified solutions of 1 -nitroso- 2 -naphthol containing a trace of sodium nitrite coupled with tyrosine-rich sites to form an unstable green fluorescent conjugate. This test relied on the activating influence of the phenolic group on the ortho- and para- positions in the aromatic nucleus. The specificity of the reaction was confirmed by iodinating these positions. Direct method. Dinitrofluorobenzene reacted only with phenols and thiols (but not amines) at a pH below 5. 5. By blocking the latter with iodoacetate, only the former reacted. The nitro groups of the conjugate were reduced to amines, but unfortunately attempts to demonstrate these groups by fluorescent methods (1) were unsuccessful. Carboxylic acids C-terminal carboxyl groups have been converted to methyl ketones by treating them with a mixture of acetic anhydride and pyridine at 60 Â°. The ketones thus formed were demonstrated as the Blue fluorescent zinc complexes of their salicyloyl hydrazones. This, and other experimental evidence, vitiated the hypothesis put forward by Karnovsky and Fasman (1960) that the principal reaction here was the conversion of the side-chain carboxyl groups to mixed acid anhydrides. Sites containing side-chain carboxyl groups were detected by the changes in the colour of their fluorescence from blue to green in tissue sections stained with 0. 01 % solutions of coriphosphine at pH 2 - 3 and at PH 5. The interference of the C- terminal carboxyl groups was eliminated by previously converting then to their methyl ketones (5 a). RNA was also extracted beforehand with hot perchloric acid. Nucleic acids Zirconium ions had en affinity for the phosphate groups of both types of nucleic acid which were subsequently demonstrated as their greenish-yellow fluorescent complex with morin. DNA yielded an aldehyde after brief (Feulgen) hydrolysis which was subsequently detectable as its blue fluorescent salicyloyl hydrazone. Sulphates No direct chemical methods have been found, but the presence of this group (in acid mucopolysaccharides) was inferred from the following tests: Their basophilia (towards coriphosphine) when counterstained with the acid dye, thiazol yellow. Acid mucopolysaccharides, containing only acid groups, exhibited the brown or red fluorescence of coriphosphine, while the nucleic acids and proteins fluoresced a light yellow or blue as a result of the very strong interaction between their basic amino groups and the acid dye. Their basophilia (towards coriphosphine) after selective extraction of nucleic acids. Methylation and reduction of tissue sections with lithium aluminium hydride in hot dioxane removed phosphate groups selectively. Uronic acid groups and some protein carboxyl groups were reduced to primary alcohols. Subsequent saponification and staining showed a reddish-brown fluorescence in sites containing acid mucopolysaccharides which contrasted with the weak green fluorescence of the remainder of the section. Hot perchloric acid has been used for the selective extraction of RNA. Other mineral acids and nucleases were found to be unsatisfactory for the selective extraction of nucleic fields because acid mucopolysaccharides were removed at the same time. Mild methods of methylation (using methanolic thionyl chlorine or diazomethane) have been successfully used for both the temporary and permanent blocking of sulphate and other basophilic groups. The normal technique for methylating tissues, using hot methanolic solutions of hydrochloric acid (Fisher and Lillie, 195 U) were found to be unsatisfactory; much of the reactive material was extracted from tissue sections instead of being methylated. Sulphated acid mucopolysaccharides were desulphated to a limited extent by this reagent. Using published methods based upon iron mordants (Hicks and Mathaei, 1958; Hale, 1946), it was found that acid mucopolysaccharides did not always take up ferric ions whereas nucleic acids did. Experimental evidence has been collected to show that the results published previously were fortuitously successful and were not strictly specific. Uronic acids Sections were reduced with lithium aluminium hydride (7 b) to show that the non-fluorescent dye alcian blue had a selective affinity for this group. When sections were stained with coriphosphine, they were first stained with alcian blue so as to quench the potential fluorescence of coriphosphine adsorbed onto acid mucopolysaccharides which otherwise would have been difficult to distinguish from that of nuclei. An intense blue fluorescence and a visible purple colour was observed in sites known to contain uronic acid groups after immersing sections in concentrated sulphuric acid at 60 - 75 Â°. vic-Glycols 1, 2 -glycols were cleaved to "dialdehydes" by periodic acid. Those in neutral mucopolysaccharides and glycogen were oxidised completely within 10 minutes. Those in acid mucopolysaccharide required 24 hours or longer before they were oxidised significantly. The engendered dialdehydes have been conjugated with: solutions of homo- and heterocyclic amines (particularly aminoacridine dyes) containing dissolved sulphur dioxide (pseudo-Schiff reagents). Preliminary blocking with methanolic thionyl chloride of the basophilic substance initially present in tissue sections was essential for the observation of specific staining of the engendered dialdehydes. Protein thiol groups nevertheless still interfered with the specificity of the reaction for glycols. Evidence has been accumulated in favour of the following mechanism for this type of reaction which differs from that suggested by Kasten (1958); the engendered dialdehydes take up sulphur dioxide from the dye solution to form sulphenic acids which subsequently combine with the basic dye in a salt-like linkage. Apart from p-aminosalicylic acid, no potentially fluorescent amine has been found to condense with engendered aldehydes in situ, contrary to what Kasten (1958) conjectured and to the numerous reports of fluorescent anil formation of aldehydes in solution. Recent chemical work (Guthrie and Honeyman 1959) has indicated that hydrazines and hydrazides always react with engendered dialdehydes whereas Schiff-type reagents may not, particularly if the dialdehydes are converted to hemiacetal or hemialdol forms. This fact has been confirmed histochemically: salicyloyl hydrazide formed intensely blue fluorescent complexes reliably and more extensively with engendered dialdehydes than do pseudo-Schiff reagents. Moreover, salicyloyl hydrazides did not form any fluorescent artefacts with protein thiol groups after oxidation in periodic acid (Cf. 9 a). The phenylhydrazones of the dialdehydes formed in situ, unlike those in vitro, did not form formazans except with diazotised aniline in pyrnine. Hydroxyl groups The basophilic properties (towards azure A or coriphosphine) of this group after it had been sulphated were studied. The <b>sulphating</b> efficiencies of various Lewis base complexes of sulphur trioxide were investigated in both acid end basic media. The dioxan-sulphur trioxide dissolved in the weak base dimethylformamide (DMF) or sulphur trioxide dissolved in DMF were very efficient <b>sulphating</b> reagents, even for glycogen which could not be sulphated by acidic <b>sulphating</b> reagents. The amine groups of proteins were sulphated simultaneously by the DMF-sulphur trioxide complex. However, the N-sulphate groups, unlike O- sulphate groups, were easily hydrolysed off by methanolic hydrochloric acid at room temperature. If the amine groups were protected beforehand with suitable blocking reagents, the access of the <b>sulphating</b> complex to hydroxyl groups was completely hindered. Although glycogen in tissue sections can be sulphated normally by sulphuryl chloride vapour, the hydroxyl groups of neutral mucopolysaccharides were not sulphated in the same way: it is Relieved that in the latter, non-basophilic cyclic sulphate groups were formed. Primary hydroxyl groups The selective sulphation and subsequent basophilia (towards azure A or coriphosphine) of this group by the pyridine-sulphur trioxide complex in the DMF was investigated. Lipids Unsaturated lipids were oxidised by peracetic acid to aldehydes and subsequently condensed with salicyloyl hydrazide to form a blue fluorescent hydrazone. Lipids emitted a reddish-pink fluorescence when sections were stained with an acidified solution of protoporphyrin IX. Ketosteroids formed blue fluorescent salicyloyl hydrazones, most of whom, unlike aldehydo -salicyloylhydrazones, were stable towards alkalis. The interfering aldehydes originating from the autooxidation of lipids were blocked with sulphanilic acid. </ol...|$|E
40|$|Heparan {{sulphate}} proteoglycans (HSPGs) are cell surface/secreted molecules {{expressed by}} all cells. HSPGs consist of carbohydrate side-chains {{attached to a}} core protein and are involved in regulating key signalling pathways in the developing mammalian brain via sugar-protein interactions. It has been hypothesized, in the ‘heparan sulphate (HS) code hypothesis’, that the specificity for {{the interaction between the}} HSPGs and particular signalling pathways is encoded by its HS side-chain. HS has an enormous variety of structures due to postsynthetic modification. Hs 2 st and Hs 6 st 1 are enzymes involved in generating different HS structures by <b>sulphating</b> the 2 -carbon or 6 -carbon molecule of the sugar backbone respectively. Fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs) are a family of signalling molecules crucial for forebrain development. Some of its members such as Fgf 8 are morphogens which pattern the forebrain via regulated gradient formation while others such as Fgf 2 drive neurogenesis and cell proliferation. One of the main molecular consequences of Fgf signalling is activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) where the activation of Erk then drives developmental events such as neurogenesis or cell migration. Based on previous studies on the HS code hypothesis, we hypothesized that differential sulphation regulates Fgf signalling in a specific manner depending on the HS sulphation pattern. We performed binding assays on Hs 2 st-/- mice to ascertain the molecular mechanism behind the role of differential sulphation in Erk signalling through Fgf 2 in the forebrain. We found that differential sulphation also has an important role to play in regionally targeting Fgf 2 /Erk signalling through regulating the formation of active signalling complexes. Studying the Fgf 8 /Erk signalling axis at E 14. 5 developing mouse corticoseptal boundary (CSB) revealed increased Fgf 8 levels and Erk hyperactivation in both Hs 2 st and Hs 6 st 1 null mutants. The dysregulation of Fgf 8 /Erk signalling at the CSB also highly correlates with the high expression of Hs 2 st and Hs 6 st 1 at the CSB. A closer look into the molecular phenotypes of Hs 2 st-/- and Hs 6 st 1 -/- CSB revealed differences between them in which Hs 6 st 1 -/- CSB has higher Fgf 8 levels compared to Hs 2 st-/- CSB. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying Hs 2 st and Hs 6 st 1 role at the CSB, we investigated the formation and interpretation of Fgf 8 /Erk signalling gradient using Fgf 8 bead assays in mice with Hs 2 st and Hs 6 st 1 loss of function throughout development. We found that differential sulphation has a complex effect on Fgf 8 gradient formation and interpretation in the forebrain in which Hs 2 st acts to stabilise the Fgf 8 distribution through regulating Fgf 8 levels through time while Hs 6 st 1 acts to stabilise the Fgf 8 distribution by maintaining the shape of the Fgf 8 gradient through restricting Fgf 8 levels during the formation of the Fgf 8 distribution. In addition, we found Hs 2 st and Hs 6 st 1 both function to increase the sensitivity of the CSB to Fgf 8 for an Erk response although through different modes of action. Therefore, we conclude that differential HS sulphation plays a specific role in Fgf/Erk signalling depending on the HS sulphation pattern...|$|E

40|$|Smooth muscle cells {{isolated}} from neonatal rat hearts synthesize and secrete radioactively labelled proteoglycans into two distinct extracellular compartments, the pericellular (cell surface/matrix layer) {{and the culture}} medium (extracellular). Cultures grown {{in the presence of}} ascorbic acid synthesize proteoglycans that are more highly <b>sulphated</b> than those produced in the absence of ascorbate. The glycosaminoglycan chains associated with the proteoglycans synthesized by rat smooth muscle cells were heparan <b>sulphate,</b> chondroitin <b>sulphate</b> and dermatan <b>sulphate.</b> There was no evidence for the synthesis of hyaluronic acid by these cells. Most of the heparan <b>sulphate</b> was found {{to be associated with the}} pericellular and intracellular compartments, whereas the extracellular compartment contained the bulk of the chondroitin <b>sulphate.</b> In the presence of ascorbate there was an increase in dermatan <b>sulphate</b> content of the pericellular compartment at the expense of heparan <b>sulphate,</b> whilst in the absence of ascorbate the heparan <b>sulphate</b> content of this compartment was significantly increased. Hyaluronic acid and the antibiotic Tunicamycin had no effect on the biosynthesis of <b>sulphated</b> macromolecules produced by the rat smooth muscle cells. However, p-nitrophenyl-β-D-xyloside increased by 10 -fold the amount of radioactive <b>sulphate</b> incorporation into macromolecules in the extracellular compartment. This increase was due to increased sulphation of glycosaminoglycan chains synthesized in the presence of the exogenous acceptor, as evidenced by the sulphate/ uronate ratio of these <b>sulphated</b> macromolecules. Furthermore, heparan <b>sulphate</b> secretion into the extracellular compartment was decreased whilst dermatan <b>sulphate</b> increased in the presence of xyloside. Pulse-chase experiments with radioactive <b>sulphate</b> were used to study the pathways and kinetics of secretion in the rat smooth muscle cell system. The data from these studies are consistent with a very rapid intracellular sulphation mechanism followed by rapid secretion to the pericellular compartment of macromolecular <b>sulphated</b> proteoglycans. Subsequently some of these molecules then travel to the extracellular compartment. The time that different proteoglycan species remain associated with the pericellular compartment is influenced by the different matrix connective tissue proteins found in this compartment as a result of ascorbate supplementation or deprivation. During the course of these investigations, it was observed that the pericellular compartment contributed to catabolism of <b>sulphated</b> macromolecules. The <b>sulphated</b> proteoglycans associated with this compartment are acted upon by a sulphatase or sulphatases to give rise to free radioactive inorganic <b>sulphate</b> and macromolecules which have been desulphated.
