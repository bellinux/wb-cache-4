5|$|Harmless to humans, {{the tiger}} {{catshark}} is caught incidentally by bottom trawlers, recreational anglers, and rarely squid fishers. Though edible, {{it is not}} a valued catch and is usually discarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks <b>sufficient</b> <b>data</b> to assess its conservation status.|$|E
5|$|In a {{parliamentary}} hearing in 2002 both DNK director Tor Helge Lyngstøl and Minister of Justice, Odd Einar Dørum, {{stated that the}} choice of TETRA would provide <b>sufficient</b> <b>data</b> capacity. In {{a parliamentary}} decision in 2004 {{it was decided to}} opt for the open European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) as a data transmission standard, which is used by all other police TETRA systems in Europe, but this was later changed by the directorate to the proprietary TETRA Enhanced Data Service (TEDS) owned by Motorola. The latter would limit the number of supplies and would increase the investment costs.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Trepkos {{arrive on}} the scene. Mulder radios the {{evacuation}} team but—knowing that Trepkos will refuse to go—reports that only he and Scully have survived the ordeal. The agents enter a month-long quarantine while the Chemical Corps confiscates the lab and cordons off Mount Avalon. Firewalker is salvaged, but is too damaged to yield <b>sufficient</b> <b>data.</b> Trepkos and O'Neil are officially unaccounted for and presumed dead; Trepkos is last seen carrying O'Neil's body as he disappears into the volcano.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, the neurosciences clearly support Michael Lewis’s didactic {{approach}} to language acquisition/learning {{that has been}} in circulation for about two decades now: Language must be seen as ‘grammaticalized lexis’. A learner must have <b>sufficient</b> semantic <b>data</b> at hand {{in order to be able}} to construct meaning. At first this is exclusively semantic meaning, which is then transferred into higher level thinking once <b>sufficient</b> semantic <b>data</b> is available to enable the learner to infer the underlying structures. Learners move progressively from semantic meaning into more abstract syntactic and morphological meaning.|$|R

5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the viper dogfish captures prey by {{protruding}} its jaws and impaling them with its teeth. Its impressive gape {{allows it to}} swallow relatively large fish whole. The skeletal and muscular structure of its head shows unique features that support this feeding mechanism, which is unlike that of other dogfish sharks. This shark gives birth to live young, which are nourished by yolk during gestation; the litter size is probably fewer than 26 pups. Small numbers of viper dogfish are caught incidentally in purse seines and bottom trawls. The IUCN presently lacks <b>sufficient</b> <b>data</b> to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E
5|$|Small {{bony fishes}} {{are the main}} prey of the nervous shark, while crustaceans, molluscs, and snakes may also be eaten. It is viviparous, with the {{developing}} embryos nourished through a placental connection. The details of its life history seem to vary depending on latitudefor example, {{the timing of the}} breeding season and the length of the gestation period. Females produce litters of one to six young either annually or biennially. The harmless nervous shark is caught incidentally by coastal gillnet fisheries and perhaps also by line and trawl fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lacks <b>sufficient</b> <b>data</b> to assess the conservation status of this species except in Australian waters, where its population seems healthy and has been listed under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} prey of {{the common}} stingray are bottom-dwelling crustaceans, though it also takes molluscs, polychaete worms, and small bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous: the embryos are nourished by yolk and later histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females bear 4–9 young twice per year in shallow water, after a gestation period of four months. The common stingray can inflict a painful, though rarely life-threatening, wound with its venomous tail spine. During classical antiquity, its sting was ascribed many mythical properties. This species is not sought after by commercial fisheries, but is taken in large numbers as bycatch and utilized for food, fishmeal, and liver oil. Its population is apparently dwindling across its range, though there is not yet <b>sufficient</b> <b>data</b> for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it beyond Data Deficient.|$|E

5|$|With flabby {{muscles and}} a large oily liver, the false {{catshark}} is a slow-moving predator and scavenger {{of a variety of}} fishes and invertebrates. It has a viviparous mode of reproduction, featuring an unusual form of oophagy in which the developing embryos consume ova or egg fragments released by the mother and use the yolk material to replenish their external yolk sacs for later use. This species typically gives birth to two pups at a time. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks <b>sufficient</b> <b>data</b> to assess the conservation status of the false catshark. While neither targeted by fisheries nor commercially valuable, it is caught incidentally by longlines and bottom trawls, and its low reproductive rate may render it susceptible to population depletion.|$|E
5|$|The {{bramble shark}} {{is not known}} to pose a danger to humans. It is caught {{incidentally}} by commercial fisheries in bottom trawls and on fishing line, {{as well as by}} sport anglers. In the eastern Atlantic, this species is processed into fishmeal but has little commercial significance. Its liver oil is highly valued in South Africa as medicine, whereas in India the oil is considered poor and is used to coat canoes to discourage woodboring beetles. Historical accounts suggest that bramble shark numbers in the northeastern Atlantic have fallen markedly since the 18th and 19th centuries, such as that it is now extremely rare off northern Europe and in the Mediterranean. This decline has been attributed to fishing pressure, to which this species may be highly vulnerable as large, deep-sea sharks generally have slow growth rates and long lifespans. Regarding the species as a whole, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lacks <b>sufficient</b> <b>data</b> for an assessment beyond Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} reasons for the {{reluctance}} of some dealers to sell plug-in electric vehicles. PEVs do not offer car dealers the same profits as gasoline-powered car. Plug-in electric vehicles take more time to sell because of the explaining required, which hurts overall sales and sales people commissions. Electric vehicles also may require less maintenance, resulting in loss of service revenue, and thus undermining the biggest source of dealer profits, their service departments. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADS), dealers on average make {{three times as much}} profit from service as they do from new car sales. However, a NADS spokesman said there was not <b>sufficient</b> <b>data</b> to prove that electric cars would require less maintenance. According to the New York Times, BMW and Nissan are among the companies whose dealers tend to be more enthusiastic and informed, but only about 10% of dealers are knowledgeable on the new technology.|$|E
