40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we apply}} the {{technology}} of Internet of things in wireless base <b>station</b> <b>inspection.</b> This actualize the long distance information acquisition about base station equipment and environment, actualize the real time feedback about hitch and alarm of station equipment, and improve stabilization of communication system and efficiency of inspections. A new remote control method based on SMS interception is proposed aiming at the problem that remote control must be connected to internet. Also a new anti-collision algorithm for simple labeling system is introduced aiming at the problem of multi-tag RFID conflicts. Finally, users can realize the remote control and inspection {{as long as they}} connect with internet...|$|E
40|$|Problems {{which will}} be {{encountered}} by computer vision systems in Space Station operations are discussed, along with solutions be examined at Johnson Space Station. Lighting cannot be controlled in space, nor can the random presence of reflective surfaces. Task-oriented capabilities are to include docking to moving objects, identification of unexpected objects during autonomous flights to different orbits, and diagnoses of damage and repair requirements for autonomous Space <b>Station</b> <b>inspection</b> robots. The approaches being examined to provide these and other capabilities are television IR sensors, advanced pattern recognition programs feeding on data from laser probes, laser radar for robot eyesight and arrays of SMART sensors for automated location and tracking of target objects. Attention is also being given to liquid crystal light valves for optical processing of images for comparisons with on-board electronic libraries of images...|$|E

40|$|Flexible {{manufacturing}} systems (FMS) are {{production systems}} consisting of identical multipurpose numerically controlled machines (workstations), automated material handling system, tools, load and unload <b>stations,</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>stations,</b> storage areas and a hierarchical control system. The latter has {{the task of}} coordinating and integrating all {{the components of the}} whole system for automatic operations. A particular characteristic of FMSs is their complexity along with the difficulties in building analytical models that capture the system in all its important aspects. Thus optimal control strategies, or at least good ones, are hard to find and the full potential of manufacturing systems is not completely exploited...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{simulation}} of the flexible manufacturing system. Flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) are production systems consisting of identical multipurpose numerically controlled machines (workstations), automated material handling system, tools, load and unload <b>stations,</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>stations,</b> storage areas and a hierarchical control system. The model will prioritize the job and select the best alternative route with multi-criteria scheduling through an approach based on a fuzzy logic. There are three criteria for both the job sequencing and routing with 27 rules. With {{the help of the}} rules the sequence of the jobs are done and the best route is selected...|$|R
40|$|Mini Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (MUAVs) are {{becoming}} popular research platform and drawing considerable attention, {{particularly during the}} last decade due to their multi-dimensional applications in almost every walk of life. MUAVs range from simple toys found at electronic supermarkets for entertainment purpose to highly sophisticated commercial platforms performing novel assignments like offshore wind power <b>station</b> <b>inspection</b> and 3 D modelling of buildings. This paper presents an overview of the main aspects in the domain of distributed control of cooperating MUAVs to facilitate the potential users in this fascinating field. Furthermore it gives an overview on state of the art in MUAV technologies e. g. Photonic Mixer Devices (PMD) camera, distributed control methods and on-going work and challenges, which is the motivation for many researchers {{all over the world to}} work in this field...|$|E

By using 1 : 50 000 DEM (digital elevation model) and American ETM satellite image superposition, it fabricates electronic sand plate map of the area, superposes road, stream, reservoir, toponym, inhabited area and other geo-information and guard <b>station,</b> <b>inspection</b> station, watchtower and other forestry infrastructure and connects respective attribute database simultaneously. By using an integrative system of GPS, data transfer and call functions, it can realize forest inventory control, watchman inspecting post, real-time fire control command and measure of distance, area, desquamation excavated volume, intervisibility analyses, flooding analyses, query gradient, slope aspect and other geography parameters as well as localization observation and other three-dimensional analysis functions. 1...|$|E
40|$|Within the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings, {{momentum}} {{has been}} building to define and manage the human footprint of research stations in Antarctica. This has been reflected by national operators and researchers offering varied approaches to measuring “footprint”. By not having a standard method, comparative measurements have shown great disparity. By formulating a standard approach, this study delivered a method that enables comparison. To achieve this, recognition was needed of the vastly different environments in which Antarctic stations are situated. To aid this, defining what to measure, resources consumed, and location descriptors were developed to represent the actual impact of the footprint. The model was then tested on Australia’s Davis <b>Station.</b> <b>Inspection</b> of aerial photography and mapping with geographical information systems was supported by field measurements. The model {{was found to be}} applicable, with on-the-ground measurements detecting additional footprint area not obvious from the desktop methods. While open to refinement, this study offers a standardised and comparable approach to measuring the footprint of Antarctic research stations...|$|E
30|$|The {{system we}} {{consider}} {{in this paper}} consists of n machines, n fixed-size buffers, and m+ 1 <b>inspection</b> <b>stations</b> (one <b>inspection</b> <b>station</b> {{is at the end}} of the line and m are internal) in series. We explore the impact of quality constraints on the system performance and (numerical) complexity. The objective is to simultaneously minimize the combined storage and shortage costs, determine the optimal buffers’ sizes, and specify the optimal number and positions of the m internal <b>inspection</b> <b>stations.</b> The resulting mathematical model is an intractable combinatorial nonlinear optimization model; it is difficult to find an exact solution in a reasonable time, especially when the production line is large. This paper develops an efficient evolutionary heuristic for this complex model. While the number of machines considered in the literature does not exceed 10 (to the best of our knowledge), this paper aims at solving larger production lines and a variable number of <b>inspection</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R
