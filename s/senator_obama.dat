25|$|The Associated Press {{reported}} in September 2008 that <b>Senator</b> <b>Obama</b> was proposing a National Health Insurance Exchange {{that would include}} both private insurance plans and a Medicare-like government run option. Coverage would be guaranteed regardless of health status, and premiums would not vary based on health status either. The campaign estimates {{the cost of the}} program at $60 billion annually. The plan requires that parents cover their children, but does not require adults to buy insurance.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the election, {{commentators}} discussed whether <b>Senator</b> <b>Obama</b> {{would be}} able to redraw the electoral map by winning states that had been voting for Republican candidates in recent decades. In many ways, he was successful. He won every region of the country by double digits except the South, which John McCain won by nine percent. Obama won Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, North Carolina, Florida, and Virginia in the South (region as defined by the US Census Bureau). McCain won most of the Deep South, where white voters have supported Republican candidates by large margins in the last few decades. Obama also defied political bellwethers, becoming the first person to win the presidency while losing Missouri since 1956 (as well as the first Democrat ever to do so) and while losing Kentucky and Tennessee since 1960. He was the first Democrat to win without Arkansas since that state joined the Union in 1836 and the first Democrat to win the presidency without winning West Virginia since 1916. Because one West Virginia elector voted for the Democrat in 1916, Obama was the first Democrat to win without any electors from the state since its founding in 1863. Indiana and Virginia voted for the Democratic nominee {{for the first time since}} 1964. Although Obama did not win other normally Republican states such as Georgia and Montana (which were won by Bill Clinton in 1992), he nonetheless was competitive in both. He lost Montana by just under 3% and Georgia by slightly more than 5%. Also notably, Barack Obama won all of the 2004 swing states (states that either Kerry or Bush won by less than 5%) by a margin of 8.5 percent or more except for Ohio, which the Democrat carried by 4.5 percent.|$|E

[...] In October 2008, she increased the intensity of her public remarks against Obama's candidacy, speaking with surprising vitriol in accusing the Obama campaign of being the dirtiest in history and saying of his position against a war-funding bill, [...] "The day that <b>Senator</b> <b>Obama</b> cast a vote not to fund my son when he was serving sent a cold chill through my body."

You actually have done a very balanced job of reporting the news, {{and some of the other}} stations are just caught up with <b>Senator</b> <b>Obama,</b> who is a great guy, but <b>Senator</b> <b>Obama</b> can do no wrong, and Senator Clinton can do no right." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 18, McCain told a {{campaign}} rally in Melbourne, Florida {{that he had}} phoned Wurzelbacher {{for the first time}} on October 17. McCain said, [...] "He's a great guy, proud of his grandfather who served in the US Marine Corps. We're going to fight for Joe, my friends, we are going to fight for him. The question Joe asked about our economy is important, because <b>Senator</b> <b>Obama's</b> plan would raise taxes on small businesses that employ 16 million Americans. <b>Senator</b> <b>Obama's</b> plan will kill those jobs at just the time when we need to be creating more jobs.
