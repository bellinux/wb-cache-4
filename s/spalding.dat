5|$|Frank Pick {{was born}} on 23 November 1878 at <b>Spalding,</b> Lincolnshire. He was the first child of five born to draper Francis Pick and his wife Fanny Pick (née Clarke). Pick's {{paternal}} grandfather, Charles Pick, was a farmer in <b>Spalding</b> who died in his forties, leaving eight children. His maternal grandfather, Thomas Clarke, was a blacksmith and Wesleyan lay preacher. As a child, Pick was bookish, preferring to read and build collections of moths and butterflies and objects found on the beach rather than take part in sports.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, Stocksbridge {{qualified}} {{for the end of}} season play-offs in their bid to return to the Premier Division, but were beaten in the semi-finals by <b>Spalding</b> United.|$|E
5|$|In July 2005 a water {{taxi service}} was {{launched}} in <b>Spalding.</b> Its route is from just off Spalding's High Street upstream along the river, turning onto the Coronation Channel, and going to Springfields Outlet Shopping & Festival Gardens, and back.|$|E
5|$|Richard de Rulos, who was Lord of Deeping Fen {{during the}} reign of William the Conqueror erected a strong {{embankment}} to prevent flooding of the meadows adjoining the river, which then became fertile fields and a pleasure garden. During the reign of Henry III (1207–1272), complaints were made that of the two channels below Crowland, the one to <b>Spalding</b> was more favourable to the passage of barges, but the Abbot of Crowland had obstructed and narrowed its course by planting willow trees. In the fourteenth century, <b>Spalding</b> was charged with failing to scour and repair the river, causing damage to the king's liege people, but argued that because it was tidal at this point, it was an arm of the sea, and so they were not responsible.|$|E
5|$|The {{management}} of Deeping Fen by trustees, appointed {{under the terms}} of the 1801 Act, continued until they were replaced in 1939 by the Deeping Fen, <b>Spalding</b> and Pinchbeck Internal Drainage Board, subsequently renamed the Welland & Deepings Internal Drainage Board.|$|E
5|$|The {{names of}} a further 24 {{casualties}} from the First World War {{were added to}} the central panel of the memorial prior to Remembrance Sunday 2014. The additions were the result of research {{by a member of the}} local branch of the Royal British Legion (RBL), which produced a list of 50 names, though the remaining casualties' connections to <b>Spalding</b> were deemed too tenuous for their names to be included. As a result of local government reorganisations, the memorial is now the responsibility of South Holland District Council, which is based in <b>Spalding.</b>|$|E
5|$|The river, in {{its upper}} reaches, {{supports}} a wild brown trout population. Chub and perch dominate the middle reaches around Stamford, with pike, perch and zander inhabiting the lower lengths around <b>Spalding.</b>|$|E
5|$|Trade on {{the lower}} river was carried in barges and keels. During the early 1800s as trade was increasing, so the river was {{simultaneously}} silting up. Around 1800, vessels carrying 60 tons could reach the port facilities at Spalding; however, by the 1820s, ships could only be loaded with 40 tons each as the river silting had worsened. Trade records indicate that in 1829, vessels carried just under 20,000 tons to and from <b>Spalding,</b> and by 1835 this had increased to over 34,000 tons. There was pressure from merchants to cater for larger vessels, and with later improvements, carried out under an act of parliament obtained in 1837, barges and sloops of up to 120 tons could use the port. Because the river was maintained for drainage, some commercial traffic continued despite the railways, and tolls of £478 were collected on 11,690 tons in 1888. Coal for <b>Spalding</b> gasworks arrived by boat until the early 1900s, and the last regular trade was the carriage of corn, hay and straw from <b>Spalding</b> to Fosdyke, where the cargo was transferred to larger ships. All commercial carrying had ceased {{by the end of}} the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|War {{memorials}} {{became a}} common sight in British towns and cities following the First World War (1914–1918). Almost one million men from Britain {{were killed in the}} conflict, and monuments were erected in virtually every settlement in the country. The memorial raised in <b>Spalding,</b> a town in southern Lincolnshire in eastern England, was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, who had previously established his reputation designing country houses for wealthy clients. From 1917 onwards, Lutyens dedicated much of his time to the memorialisation of the war dead, first advising the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) and later designing war memorials both for the commission and through his own practice. <b>Spalding</b> was one of his first war memorial commissions.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 {{a common}} grey seal {{found its way}} from the Wash up the river and spent a few weeks {{sleeping}} in gardens next to the river in Deeping St James. The seal was spotted further downstream in <b>Spalding</b> as it eventually made its {{way back to the}} sea.|$|E
5|$|In September 1919, the <b>Spalding</b> War and Victory Memorials Committee {{was formed}} to oversee {{fundraising}} and construction of the memorial, {{the total cost of}} which was £3,500. McLaren and her father-in-law Charles McLaren, 1st Baron Aberconway contributed £1,000 each, Sir Herbert and Dame Agnes Jekyll donated £100, Henry McLaren (Barbara's brother-in-law) donated the stone flags, and the remainder was raised by public subscription, which took until 1922.|$|E
5|$|Several {{prominent}} {{civil engineer}} considered {{the problems of}} Deeping Fen and the river outfall {{at the end of}} the 1700s. Two reports were produced, one by George Maxwell, and the second by Edward Hare, who had been assisted by William Jessop and John Rennie. They formed the basis for the Deeping Fen Act of 1801. The channel above <b>Spalding</b> was made deeper, the north bank was made stronger, and the North and South Drove Drains were enlarged through the fen. One of Rennie's recommendations had been to replace the windmills which drove the drainage pumps with a steam pumping station at Pode Hole, but this was not implemented. After reports by Rennie and Thomas Pear in 1815, and by Rennie alone in 1818 and 1820, the provision of steam engines was authorised by an act in 1823. The trustees appointed by the 1801 act continued to manage Deeping Fen until they were replaced in 1939 by the Deeping Fen, <b>Spalding</b> and Pinchbeck Internal Drainage Board, subsequently renamed the Welland & Deepings Internal Drainage Board.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the three}} major {{four-year}} universities in Louisville are located adjacent to Old Louisville, with <b>Spalding</b> University to the north and the University of Louisville to the south. DuPont Manual High School, a public magnet school, and Presentation Academy, an all-girls Catholic high school, are two other well-known schools located in Old Louisville.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 21st century, the {{landscape}} of large leveraged buyout firms was changing. Several large and storied firms, including Hicks Muse Tate & Furst and Forstmann Little & Company were dragged down by heavy losses in the bursting of the telecom bubble. Although, KKR's track record since RJR Nabisco was mixed, losses on such investments as Regal Entertainment Group, <b>Spalding,</b> Flagstar and Primedia (previously K-III Communications) were offset by successes in Willis Group, Wise Foods, Inc., Wincor Nixdorf and MTU Aero Engines, among others.|$|E
5|$|Barbara McLaren engaged Lutyens {{to design}} a {{memorial}} for the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which <b>Spalding</b> Urban District Council had purchased in 1897 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Lutyens proposed a U-shaped cloister sheltering a Stone of Remembrance {{standing in front of}} a circular lily pool, in the centre of which would be a cross. McLaren hoped to include space for the families of those commemorated to add their own epitaphs but this proved impractical due to the amount of space that would have been required; she insisted that her husband not receive any special commemoration beyond that afforded to the other casualties.|$|E
5|$|Hi-5 are an Australian children's musical group {{formed in}} 1998, who are {{associated}} with the children's television series of the same name. As of December 2016, the members are Lachie Dearing, Courtney Clarke, Shay Clifford, Joe Kalou and Bailey <b>Spalding.</b> The group is aimed at preschoolers, composed of five performers who entertain and educate children through music, movement and play. Hi-5 was created by Helena Harris and Posie Graeme-Evans, initially a television series for the Nine Network, which premiered in 1999. The cast of the show became a recognised musical group for children.|$|E
5|$|In May 1803 a shipload of captive West Africans, upon {{surviving}} the middle passage, were landed by U.S.-paid captors in Savannah by slave ship, to be auctioned off {{at one of}} the local slave markets. The ship's enslaved passengers included a number of Igbo people from what is now Nigeria. The Igbo were known by planters and slavers of the American South for being fiercely independent and resistant to chattel slavery. The group of 75 Igbo slaves were bought by agents of John Couper and Thomas <b>Spalding</b> for forced labor on their plantations in St. Simons Island for $100 each.|$|E
5|$|The National League's {{first win}} {{champion}} was Albert <b>Spalding,</b> {{who led the}} senior circuit with 47 wins after leading the semi-professional National Association in each of its five seasons. Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young led the American League in wins in each of its first three years (1901–1903), amassing 33, 32, and 28 victories in those seasons for the Boston Americans. Warren Spahn leads all players with 8 win championships for the Boston and Milwaukee Braves in his 21 seasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{dispute in}} 1885 {{concerned}} Game 2, which was forfeited by St. Louis when they pulled their team {{off the field}} protesting an umpiring decision. The managers, Cap Anson and Charles Comiskey, initially agreed to disregard the game. When St. Louis won the final game and an apparent 3–2 Series championship, Chicago White Stockings owner Albert <b>Spalding</b> overruled his manager and declared that he wanted the forfeit counted. The result of a tied Series was that neither team got the prize money that had been posted by the owners before the Series (and was returned to them after they both agreed it was a tie).|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the breed in America is {{relatively}} recent. The first recorded Cavalier living in the United States was brought from the United Kingdom in 1956 by W. Lyon Brown, together with Elizabeth <b>Spalding</b> and other enthusiasts, she founded the Cavalier King Charles Club USA which continues to the present day. In 1994, the American Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club was created {{by a group of}} breeders to apply for recognition by the American Kennel Club. The Cavalier would go on to be recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1995, and the ACKCSC became the parent club for Cavaliers.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} for the <b>Spalding</b> war memorial originated with Barbara McLaren (née Jekyll). Barbara was the widow of Francis McLaren—Spalding's Member of Parliament and a Royal Flying Corps officer, {{who was killed in}} a flying accident near RAF Montrose in 1917—and the niece of garden designer Gertrude Jekyll, with whom Lutyens had collaborated on multiple previous projects. Lutyens designed the McLarens' London house on Cowley Street in Westminster in 1911 and shortly after Francis' death in 1917 designed the headstone for his grave in Busbridge in Surrey. He was later responsible for the war memorial in the same village.|$|E
5|$|With {{the passing}} of the Land Drainage Act 1930, the Welland Catchment Board was created. They had spent £91,537 on the outfall by 1937. Towards the end of the Second World War, E. G. Taverner, the chief {{engineer}} for the drainage board, devised a plan to relieve flooding in <b>Spalding</b> by creating a bypass channel, and building the Greatford Cut to divert the waters of the West Glen river into the Welland upstream of Market Deeping. The scheme cost £723,000, with much of the work being carried out by W. & C. French, and the Coronation Channel around <b>Spalding</b> was opened in September 1953. Fulney lock was constructed {{at the same time to}} exclude the tide from the upper river, as was the Maxey Cut, an embanked channel that bypasses the villages of Market Deeping, Deeping Gate and Deeping St James. During the 1960s and 1970s, several sections of the river above Stamford were made straighter and deeper, to reduce the risk of flooding of agricultural land. To address the habitat and environmental issues causes by such engineering work, the Welland Rivers Trust, a limited company and charitable trust, was set up in 2010. They are seeking to direct regeneration of the river by co-ordinating various organisations, which are known collectively as the Welland Valley Partnership. They published a major document outlining their proposals in February 2013.|$|E
5|$|Below <b>Spalding,</b> {{there were}} no {{restrictions}} on headroom, which allowed small coasters to reach the town. The bridge at Fosdyke was a swing bridge, {{to comply with the}} provisions of the Fosdyke Bridge Act of 1870. The demise of such traffic allowed it {{to be replaced by a}} fixed bridge with headroom of , but the powers of the original act had to be rescinded, and the Port of Fosdyke Act was obtained in 1987 to allow this to happen. The redundant wharfs at Fosdyke have been developed to provide moorings for yachts and other pleasure craft. The lock at Fulney has three sets of gates, two pointing towards the sea, and a third between them which points upriver. The lock can thus only be used when the level below it is higher than the level above it, and as the tide falls, the intermediate gate closes to prevent its use.|$|E
5|$|Georgia State Route 279 {{was also}} flooded over {{with more than}} one foot (300mm) of water. The Lamar County Emergency Management Director {{reported}} that several dirt roads in the county were flooded and some were washed out. De Kalb County had many of its streams and creeks surpass flood stage, causing minor damage to businesses and homes. <b>Spalding</b> County also reported 15roads with extensive flooding damage. Fourteen mobile homes in Clayton County were damaged beyond repair by the flooding; 52residents were evacuated. In Riverdale, several homes were flooded, although damage was generally limited to the basements of the homes. In Fayette County, the historic Starrs Mill was inundated, and water rose to the bridge level on McDonough Road. There was also a dam breach on Lake Fowler, causing $300,000dollars (2005USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|In the late-19th century, the Sleaford {{area was}} a major barley {{producer}} and by the 1880s, Sleaford was a stop on railway lines connecting the town to Boston, Grantham, Bourne, <b>Spalding</b> and Lincoln. These qualities made the town desirable {{for the production of}} malt, a crucial ingredient in beer production. The brewers Bass, Ratcliffe and Gretton Ltd were attracted to the town and in 1880 proposed a new malting complex there, which would consolidate malting closer to the barley source and reduce costs by up-scaling production. Drilling in 1892 revealed suitable artesian water sources under Sleaford; plans were submitted nine years later and over 13 acres of land off Mareham Lane was purchased; work started in 1901 and was complete by 1907.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{improvements}} {{were made}} to the river in the 1660s, when a new cut with 10 locks was constructed between Stamford and Market Deeping, and two locks were built on the river section below Market Deeping. The canal section was known as the Stamford Canal, and was the longest canal with locks in Britain when it was built. The river provided the final outlet to the sea for land drainage schemes implemented in the seventeenth century, although they were not completely successful until a steam-powered pumping station was built at Pode Hole in 1827. Navigation on the upper river, including the Stamford Canal, had ceased by 1863, but <b>Spalding</b> remained an active port {{until the end of the}} Second World War.|$|E
5|$|<b>Spalding</b> {{had been}} a port from before any of the river {{improvements}} were made. The townspeople had refused to repair the river {{during the reign of}} Henry III, as they claimed {{it was part of the}} sea here. Its importance as a port increased with the river improvements and the Stamford Canal, and although it did not have a customs house, by 1695 it had various officials who acted as customs officers for goods arriving at the quays and warehouses. Exports included oats, coleseed, rape oil, hides and wool, with a much greater variety of imports, including stone, timber, coal, groceries, glass and beeswax. More exotic imports included French and Spanish wines, and some of the first imports of tea, coffee and chocolate.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{prevents}} even hereditary {{peers who}} {{are the first to}} hold their titles from sitting automatically in the House of Lords. The Government did agree, however, to give life peerages (the titles of which are indicated in parentheses) to four such new hereditary peers: Toby Low, 1st Baron Aldington (Baron Low), Frederick Erroll, 1st Baron Erroll of Hale (Baron Erroll of Kilmun), Francis Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford, 1st Baron Pakenham (Baron Pakenham of Cowley) and Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon (Baron Armstrong-Jones). Additionally, life peerages were created for former Leaders of the House of Lords: John Ganzoni, 2nd Baron Belstead (Baron Ganzoni), Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington (Baron Carington of Upton), Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, Viscount Cranborne (Baron Gascoyne-Cecil), George Jellicoe, 2nd Earl Jellicoe (Baron Jellicoe of Southampton), Malcolm Shepherd, 2nd Baron Shepherd (Baron Shepherd of <b>Spalding)</b> and David Hennessy, 3rd Baron Windlesham (Baron Hennessy).|$|E
5|$|The Chicago Cubs are a Major League Baseball {{team that}} {{plays in the}} National League (NL) Central Division. Since their {{inception}} as the White Stockings in 1876, the Cubs have employed 56managers. The duties of the team manager include team strategy and leadership {{on and off the}} field.

The general manager controls player transactions, hiring and firing of the coaching staff, and negotiates with players and agents regarding contracts. The first person to officially hold the title of general manager for the Cubs was Charles Weber, who assumed the title in 1934. The franchise's first manager was Baseball Hall of Famer Albert <b>Spalding,</b> who helped the White Stockings become the first champions of the newly formed National League.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson was a Jacobite. The {{records of}} the <b>Spalding</b> Club include a soldier's letter which {{indicates}} it is likely Ferguson was willing to offer refuge to Jacobites {{who participated in the}} Battle of Culloden. Jacobite rebels captured from throughout Scotland were taken to stand trial at Carlisle Castle in 1746. Ferguson and fellow advocate Alexander Lockhart argued in their defence. Prosecutors showed little mercy, calling for the rebels to be executed by hanging. Since the prosecution assumed anyone dressed in tartan was guilty, Ferguson and Lockhart had their servants dress in tartan and appear along with the other defendants. They called each other to the stand to testify as to the whereabouts of the servants and proved that, despite their tartan dress, the defendants could not have taken part in the rebellion. Many were found guilty, but the tactic succeeded, as some of the accused were acquitted, including the Laird of Dunfallandy, a kinsman of Ferguson.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge at}} Deeping Gate carries the date 1651, {{and is a}} Grade II* listed stone {{structure}} with three round arches. After the remains of Deeping High lock and Deeping Low lock, there is a junction where the old course, the Maxey Cut, the South Drain and the Folly River, also a drain, meet. The river is officially navigable below this point. Through Crowland and Cowbit {{to the edge of}} <b>Spalding,</b> the river is laid out with washlands, which were historically used as pasture, because the river was allowed to flood the land when tidal levels prevented the water discharging into the sea. The river is bounded on the north and west by a bank, while the New River, a drainage channel to the south and east of it, is bounded by another bank. The land between the channels forms Crowland High Wash, Crowland Fodder Lots and Cowbit Wash. The southern bank is variously named Corporation Bank, Wash Bank and Barrier Bank. These wash lands were designed to be flooded in extremis, although the building of the Coronation flood relief channel has made this purpose obsolete.|$|E
5|$|The fen was {{inundated}} in 1798, and {{the civil}} engineers William Jessop and John Rennie were asked to assist the local engineers Edward Hare and George Maxwell. There was a clear understanding that the outfalls were too high to allow proper drainage by gravity, and two possible solutions were considered. The first was an outfall at a lower level, which would involve hugh expense in its construction, and the second, favoured by Jessop and Rennie, was the provision of steam pumping engines at Pode Hole. These would pump water from the internal drains of the fen to Vernatt's Drain, and the lower internal water levels would allow the existing wind-powered drainage mills to work efficiently. A report was produced, which {{formed the basis for}} the Deeping Fen Act of 1801. The channel of the Welland above <b>Spalding</b> was made deeper, the north bank was made stronger, and the North and South Drove Drains which crossed the fen to join Vernatt's Drain at Pode Hole were made deeper. At the time there were no steam engines working in the fens, and Rennie's recommendation of a steam pumping station at Pode Hole was not implemented.|$|E
