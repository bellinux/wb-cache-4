50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the bar frame while the slide valves, arranged above the cylinders, were actuated by <b>Stephenson</b> <b>link</b> <b>motion</b> through rocker shafts. Two sandboxes were mounted atop the boiler, {{fore and aft}} of the steam dome.|$|E
5000|$|... 4767 was {{completed}} {{on the last}} day of the LMS, 31 December 1947 at Crewe Works. It was unique amongst the 842-strong class in that it featured outside <b>Stephenson</b> <b>link</b> <b>motion</b> in addition to other experimental features; a double chimney, Timken roller bearings throughout and electric lighting.|$|E
5000|$|The engine had {{inclined}} cylinders, arranged {{outside the}} plate frames. Its balanced slide valves were arranged above the cylinders and were actuated by <b>Stephenson</b> <b>link</b> <b>motion</b> through rocker shafts.

5000|$|The locomotive's {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the frame, while the slide valves were arranged between the frames and actuated by <b>Stephenson</b> valve gear <b>link</b> <b>motion</b> through rocker shafts. The boiler dome was arranged above the firebox, with two Salter safety valves which were adjusted {{to blow off}} at [...] The locomotive was equipped with a No. 40 combination ejector and two vacuum brake cylinders, each 15 in in diameter.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s both 44686 and 44687 worked off Southport shed (code 27C) on {{passenger}} trains from Southport to Manchester and Rochdale via Bolton. Other non-standard LMSR 5MTs were at Southport including LMSR Caprottis and the unique <b>Stephenson</b> <b>Link</b> machine 44767.|$|R
50|$|For {{the first}} time on Bavarian locomotives, running plates and Hardy vacuum brakes were {{installed}} on these saturated-steam engines. Several examples had gangways as well. An unusual feature was the location of the sandbox under the running plate between the coupled axles. They had slide valves on top and outside <b>Stephenson</b> <b>link</b> <b>motion.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} had a round-topped firebox. The cylinders were inclined {{and arranged}} outside the engine frame, while the slide valves were actuated by <b>Stephenson</b> <b>Link</b> <b>motion.</b> The cab {{sides of the}} early locomotives were not enclosed, but were equipped with canvas roller blinds to offer the crew some protection against the elements.|$|E
50|$|For {{improved}} accessibility, {{the steam}} chests were mounted outside the frames instead of between them. The slide valves, operated by <b>Stephenson</b> <b>Link</b> <b>motion,</b> were {{on top of}} the cylinders and employed rocker shafts. The balance weight for the Stephenson motion was seldom used on American locomotives and was replaced by a powerful coiled spring.|$|E
50|$|The Stephenson {{valve gear}} or <b>Stephenson</b> <b>link</b> or {{shifting}} link {{is a simple}} design of valve gear that was widely used throughout the world {{for all kinds of}} steam engines. It is named after Robert Stephenson but was invented by his employees.|$|R
5000|$|The London and South Western Railway L11 {{class was}} {{a class of}} 4-4-0 steam {{locomotives}} designed for mixed traffic work. They were introduced in 1903 and were nicknamed [...] "Large Hoppers". As with most other Drummond productions, the locomotive had two inside cylinders and <b>Stephenson</b> <b>link</b> valve gear.|$|R
50|$|A {{distinctive}} feature of these engines was {{their use of}} external valve gear. Using external cylinders, valve gear and Walschaerts valve gear rather than <b>Stephenson</b> <b>link</b> were all features of the same post-war trends that also appeared in the BR Standard classes, but they were largely alien to traditional industrial saddle tanks.|$|R
50|$|The pistons, with a bore of 18.5 in, {{were the}} largest yet {{used on the}} 6th Class. The piston valves, {{arranged}} above the cylinders, were cast iron, 6 in in diameter and actuated by <b>Stephenson</b> <b>Link</b> <b>motion</b> through rocking shafts. The balance weight {{was replaced by a}} compression spring encased in a cast-steel cylinder.|$|E
50|$|There {{was talk}} of them at one point having outside Walschaerts valve gear {{which would have been}} a major break from {{traditional}} GWR designs. In the event the favoured inside <b>Stephenson</b> <b>link</b> <b>motion</b> of the GWR was used, but the GWR 1500 Class, also designed by Hawksworth, used outside Walschaerts - the only standard gauge locomotive designed by the GWR to do so.|$|E
50|$|British Railways built twenty {{locomotives}} of the LMS Stanier Black Five type, {{fitted with}} Caprotti valve gear, in 1948. These were numbered 44738-57. The LMS Stanier Black Fives had been fitted with Walschaerts valve gear as standard. In 1947, {{as part of}} an experimental programme by George Ivatt to try to improve the already good design, (4)4767 was built with <b>Stephenson</b> <b>link</b> <b>motion.</b> The Caprotti-fitted Black Fives were part of the same programme.|$|E
2500|$|The design spawned {{from the}} {{relative}} failure of Drummond's C8 Class of 1898, utilising many {{lessons learned from}} this design. [...] A larger boiler was implemented, and such confidence was placed in Drummond's design that an order of 50 locomotives was placed straight off the drawing board. Large fireboxes and <b>Stephenson</b> <b>link</b> valve gear ensured a free-steaming locomotive.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} used {{saturated steam}} and had flat [...] "D" [...] type slide valves, placed above the cylinders {{and operated by}} <b>Stephenson</b> <b>Link</b> valve gear through rocker shafts. The leading wheels were mounted in a spring control bogie {{which was designed to}} overcome the problems of excessive flange wear on the coupled wheels and rail cutting on curves.|$|R
50|$|The locomotive's slide valves were {{arranged}} above the inclined cylinders and were actuated by Joy valve gear, {{which had been}} invented in 1879 by David Joy, the Locomotive Superintendent of the Oxford, Dorchester and Wolverhampton Railway. Joy valve gear did not make use of eccentrics like the <b>Stephenson</b> <b>Link</b> valve gear which had hitherto been used and which, at times, proved to be troublesome.|$|R
50|$|In 1879, four 4-4-0 American type tender {{passenger}} locomotives {{were delivered}} to the CGR from Avonside Engine Company for fast passenger service out of Cape Town and East London respectively. They were equipped with 48 in coupled wheels and six-wheeled tenders, numbered W25 and W26 for the Western System and E8 and E9 for the Eastern System. Their slide valves were actuated by <b>Stephenson</b> <b>Link</b> <b>motion,</b> while their boiler barrels were constructed in three sections, arranged telescopically.|$|E
50|$|In 1902, {{a drawing}} was made showing a 2-6-4T tank locomotive, {{based on a}} {{proposal}} to convert the NZR V class 2-6-2 tender locomotives to tank locomotives. It was noted that the tractive effort of the new engine was 10,260lbs, considerably less than the 12,890lbs of the slightly smaller NZR W class 2-6-2T, and that a new boiler with a greater working pressure of 140psi {{would be required to}} have made the conversion of any real use. It was considered uneconomic to fit new boilers to the old V class frames and running gear, which would have retained the obsolete <b>Stephenson</b> <b>link</b> <b>motion</b> and so the proposal lapsed in favour of developing the last three engines of the WA class 2-6-2T tank locomotives, nos. 50, 68, and 137.|$|E
5000|$|The {{increased}} {{distance travelled}} by many trains highlighted {{problems with the}} fireboxes and chimneys. With the co-operation of the North Midland Railway at their Derby works, he measured {{the temperature of the}} exhaust gases, and decided to lengthen the boilers on future engines. Initially these [...] "long-boiler" [...] engines were 2-2-2 designs, but in 1844, Stephenson moved the trailing wheel to the front in 4-2-0 formation, so that the cylinders could be mounted between the supporting wheels. It was one of these, the [...] "Great A" [...] along with another from the North Midland Railway, which was compared with Brunel's [...] "Ixion" [...] in the gauge trials in 1846. In 1846 he added a pair of trailing wheels - the first with eight wheels. Another important innovation in 1842 was the <b>Stephenson</b> <b>link</b> <b>motion.</b>|$|E
50|$|Interestingly, in {{both the}} UK and the USA, single Fairlies were the first {{locomotives}} in each country to use the European Walschaerts valve gear. The <b>Stephenson</b> <b>link</b> gear, which was usual at the time, used multiple eccentrics between the frames but the Walschaerts gear was mounted outboard of the frames and connecting rods. This was advantageous because the Fairlie system required this space between the frames for the bogie pivot.|$|R

50|$|A prestigious {{contract}} for Humphrys, Tennant and Co. was {{the power plant}} for the 1899 Royal Yacht Victoria and Albert (see image). The two engines were capable of 7500 indicated horsepower continuously, and 11,000 indicated horsepower for short periods at a maximum of 140 rpm. The engines had high- and intermediate-pressure cylinders located between double low-pressure cylinders. The cylinder diameters were 26.5 in, 44.5 in and 2x53 in, all with a 39 in stroke. There was both steam and hand reversing gear operating via <b>Stephenson</b> <b>link</b> <b>motion.</b> The high- and intermediate-pressure cylinders used piston valves, whereas the low-pressure cylinders used slide valves. Each engine had twin condensers arranged so that either could {{be taken out of}} service for repair without stopping the engines, and each engine had two air pumps driven off the low-pressure connecting rods. Eighteen Belleville boilers provided steam at up to 300 psi, though this was dropped to 250 psi at the engines by reducing valves.|$|E
50|$|By early 1922 {{management}} decided {{things could}} not be left alone and in April of that year No.s 957 and 958 were rebuilt to the strange arrangement of Walschaerts valve gears for the outside cylinders and <b>Stephenson</b> <b>link</b> <b>motion</b> for the inside one. At the same time No. 959 was given {{a modified version of}} the standard Caledonian equipment but with dashpots added to absorb stress that was thought to exist at some points. No. 956 was first given a different variation of the standard arrangement, then brought into line with No. 959, but by the end of 1922 both had been altered again, this time to the same mixed gear arrangement as 957/958. It would have been difficult to retrofit Walschaerts gear to the inside cylinder (because there would be no mounting-point for the combination lever) but it seems strange that a modified Walschaerts gear was not used. It would have been possible to add a second eccentric to drive the combination lever.|$|E
50|$|The Finnish Steam Locomotive Class C1s were {{typical of}} the Victorian {{principles}} of locomotive design and the British 0-6-0 of the period with inside cylinders and <b>Stephenson</b> <b>link</b> <b>motion.</b> There is a similarity with the NER Class C1, Caledonian Railway 294 and 711 Classes, Caledonian Railway 812 and 652 Classes, LB&SCR C class, and SER O class. The wood-burning smoke stacks and wooden cab sides were installed for Finnish conditions. It should be remembered that the Grand Duchy of Finland was an autonomous part of the Russian Empire until 1917. Neilson also supplied a number of similar 5 foot gauge 0-6-0s to other railways in the Russian Empire, but few photographs and drawings remain. No 1427 at the Finnish Railway Museum is the only preserved example, and is therefore the only surviving example of the varied 0-6-0 types that were once common across the Russian Empire in the 19th Century. It therefore {{is one of the}} few clues as to the design of these Russian 0-6-0 locomotives that we now have. In fact, No.30 ended up remaining in Finland Station, St. Petersburg, Russia in 1918 during the civil wars in Finland and Russia.|$|E
25|$|On 15 September 1830, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was opened, {{the first}} inter-city railway {{in the world}} and was {{attended}} by Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington. The railway was engineered by Joseph Locke and George <b>Stephenson,</b> <b>linked</b> the rapidly expanding industrial town of Manchester with the port town of Liverpool. The opening was marred by problems, due to the primitive nature of the technology being employed, however problems were gradually ironed out and the railway became highly successful, transporting passengers and freight. The success of the inter-city railway, particularly in the transport of freight and commodities, led to Railway Mania.|$|R
5000|$|North British Railway S class (later LNER J37 class) 0-6-0 freight tender engine {{designed}} by William Reid, two inside cylinders, slide valves, indirect <b>link</b> <b>motion</b> with rocker arm valve gear.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} horizontally {{and outside the}} engine frame. The slide valves, mounted above the cylinders, were actuated by Stephenson's <b>Link</b> <b>motion.</b> The engine's boiler barrel setions were not arranged telescopically, but were jointed end-to-end with butt straps.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} built by William Mason for the Baltimore and Ohio in 1856, most likely for {{passenger}} service. The engine, while not given a name (the road had ended the practice of naming locomotives at the time no. 25 was built), was the road's second engine to be numbered 25, replacing an earlier 4-4-0 of that number built by William Norris in 1839. Among the engine's notable features is the [...] "three-point suspension," [...] where unlike most earlier locomotives (i.e. the road's Lafayette), which the front bogie has its wheels closely spaced, the number 25's bogie had its wheels spread apart, with the cylinder mounted horizontally between them. While the engine {{was not the first}} to have this design, it represented a major improvement in locomotive design which would come to define the [...] "American Standard" [...] locomotive. Another, similarly revolutionary design was the engine's smokebox. Unlike earlier designs, such as that of the General, built a year earlier, the number 25 had its smokebox sitting on a [...] "saddle" [...] which carried the cylinders. This design further lowered the engine's center of gravity and made re-boilering easier. The number 25 was the road's first engine to have this smokebox design, as well as the road's first engine to have <b>Stephenson</b> <b>link</b> <b>motion</b> valve gear.|$|E
40|$|Some {{computer}} simulation programs were developed on the quadric link mechanisms {{for the study}} of <b>link</b> <b>motion.</b> Using these softwares, practical lessons were tried on the machine studies in junior high schools. A programming method by BASIC interpreter were thought out to remove the flicker of moving links during the {{computer simulation}}. These softwares were judged {{to be able to use}} by the computer set on Junior high schools. In accordance with the school book, kinds and utilizations of link mechanisms, relations of lengths to the lever-crank mechanism, and changes of the <b>link</b> <b>motion</b> were confirmed to be able to teach during shorter time as compared with that of the usual teaching method...|$|R
50|$|Breaking {{coupling}} rods were a {{cause of}} accidents in 1873 and 1884 and in 1885 the cross section was increased. The problem was eventually solved in 1893 when the original Allan motion {{was replaced by a}} Gibson & Lilley <b>link</b> <b>motion,</b> this being fitted to all locomotives by 1896.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{expansive}} working {{was already}} recognised for stationary engines, although this was usually only required for engines working under a constant load. By shutting off {{the supply of}} steam early, the steam within the cylinder was allowed to expand whilst doing work against the piston. This provided considerable savings in efficiency of both coal and water consumption. In 1844, William Williams, a pattern-maker for Stephenson, made the remarkable invention of realising that if a closed gab {{was made into a}} curved link, so that it fitted the pin closely throughout its travel, then the valve gear could also be set into an intermediate position, and that this would also have the effect of giving expansive working. This gear was the genesis of the well-known <b>Stephenson</b> <b>link</b> gear.|$|R
50|$|The {{valve gear}} {{is of the}} Heusinger type, with {{internal}} <b>link</b> <b>motion</b> driven by flycrank on the left wheel of the rear coupled axle. This arrangement proved itself very reliable in contrast to maintenance problems with the Gresley conjugated valve gear and was used for all subsequent Czechoslovak three-cylinder locomotives except of one series (Class 486.1).|$|R
500|$|The unusual shape {{was also}} {{dictated}} {{by the use of}} materials; the lagging was made of a glass fibre insulation material known as 'Idaglass', which, although cheap and plentiful during the war years, could not support any weight, and therefore a separate casing was required which followed that seen in the Merchant Navy class locomotives, and the boiler rings were adapted to lend the lagging the support needed. [...] A copper, rather than steel, firebox was utilised, unlike Bulleid's Pacific designs. [...] The wheels were smaller, 5ft 1 in (1.55 m) adaptations of the Bulleid Firth Brown type utilised on the Pacifics. [...] The locomotive had two cylinders with <b>Stephenson</b> <b>link</b> outside admission piston valves, having a travel in full gear of [...] and a steam lap of [...] It was provided with a five-nozzle blast-pipe.|$|R
