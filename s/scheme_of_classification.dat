[...] "Pseudo-penannular" [...] is a coinage restricted to brooches, and refers to those brooches where there is no opening in the ring, but the design retains features of a penannular brooch—for example, emphasizing two terminals. Some pseudo-penannular brooches are very similar in design to other penannular brooches, but have a small section joining the two terminals. Others have fully joined terminals, and emphasize in their design the central area where the gap would be—for example the Tara Brooch. Pseudo-penannular brooches may also be described as [...] "annular", or as [...] "ring brooches".

[...] The original route of the designated A9 began in Edinburgh at the Corstorphine junction in {{the west of the}} city, branching north off the A8. [...] The route went through Kirkliston and onwards to Polmont and Falkirk. [...] The road then followed the now familiar route to Stirling and then up to Perth and onwards to Inverness, going through numerous villages en route. [...] The original A9 terminated at Inverness, but {{in the years that followed}} it was extended all the way up to John O'Groats. [...] By the 1970s, the A9 went north-west out of Inverness in what had originally been classified as the A88, following the Beauly Firth coast westwards through Kirkhill, Beauly and Muir of Ord. Continuing north through Dingwall, the road then began to follow the Cromarty Firth coast, where it followed largely the modern alignment, going through Alness and Tain (both now bypassed). The A9 from here followed west along the south side of the Dornoch Firth coast before reaching Bonar Bridge where the road turned sharply eastwards on the north side of the Dornoch Firth. [...] On reaching the village of Dornoch, the A9 headed north along the coast, going through several villages before reaching the town of Wick. [...] The final stretch continued north along the coast before it finally reached John O'Groats.|$|E
2500|$|Until {{the end of}} the 18th century all {{studies of}} spiders, {{scorpions}} and related forms were treated as part of the wider study of entomology, for these were described as wingless insects and included in one genus, the Aranea of Linnaeus, of perhaps 500 different species.

During the mid-19th century the centre of activity shifted away from France to Germany. An important part of this shift was due to the 14-volume work of C. W. Hahn and C. L.

In contrast to the French manuscripts with their terse descriptions and infrequent illustrations, the two-thousand-plus pages of beautiful coloured plates of this work captured the attention of zoologists everywhere.
