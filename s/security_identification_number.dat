30|$|Data were {{obtained}} through the Athens Stock Exchange website ([URL] They were checked for inconsistencies such as missing or erroneous transaction dates. They were also randomly checked with prices reported on company websites. No errors were found. The {{main body of}} data consists of daily transactions spanning time period from 1 / 1 / 2006 to 31 / 8 / 2008. They include stock code, transaction date, closing price, change (%), Volume, Highest price, Lowest price, Total Value of Transactions, Opening Price and the International <b>Securities</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Number</b> (ISIN). Transaction data before 31 / 12 / 2005 were no longer available on the Athens Stock Exchange website {{and so they were}} not included. Data after 31 / 8 / 2008 were intentionally left out because fluctuations, caused by the economic crisis which broke out in September 2008, might render transaction data unsuitable {{for the purposes of the}} present study.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new ECG based biometric {{system that has}} a doubly secure characteristic when applied to authentication. In this system {{the parameters of the}} new underlying pulse active ratio (PAR) feature vector process are represented by a 4 digit <b>security</b> personal <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> (PIN). The authentication is achieved by firstly using the correct PIN and, secondly, by obtaining a positive ECG feature vector match. The proposed method is validated by experiments on 113 subjects recorded over wide time duration. It is shown that the PAR parameters can be used to generate different set of features with similar high authentication performance in a doubly secure fashion...|$|R
40|$|We examine risk spreads charged on {{corporate}} bonds placed by emerging market borrowers on international exchanges. While global developments {{have an important}} effect on spreads, changes in firm-level default risk also matter significantly in a way consistent with theory and experience in mature markets. In contrast, except during periods of financial crisis, country factors play a limited role. These findings go against the supposition that limited information on emerging market firms or significant agency problems prevent firm-level credit discrimination by international investors. The firm-level information capitalization into spreads possibly reflects protection afforded by the exchange listing on international markets.

50|$|Normally, records {{should not}} be filed under seal without a court permission. However, FRCP 5.2 {{requires}} that sensitive text - like Social <b>Security</b> <b>number,</b> Taxpayer <b>Identification</b> <b>Number,</b> birthday, bank accounts, and childrenâs names - should be redacted off the filings made with the court and accompanying exhibits. A person making a redacted filing can file an unredacted copy under seal, or the Court can choose to order later that an additional filing be made under seal without redaction. Alternately, the filing party may ask the courtâs permission to file some exhibits completely under seal.|$|R

The redacted text can be erased with black-out or white-out, and the page should have an indication that it was redacted - most often by stamping word [...] "redacted" [...] on the bottom. Alternately, the filing party may ask the courtâs permission to file some exhibits completely under seal. A minor's name of the petitions should be replaced with initials.|$|R

Parents may also be required to furnish details relating to their marriage and divorce, if applicable, as well as documents certifying the identity and parentage of the child(ren). Local jurisdictions may charge fees for filing such applications, however, if the filing parent is receiving any sort of public assistance, these fees may be waived.|$|R
50|$|Identity theft can be {{partially}} mitigated by not identifying oneself unnecessarily (a form of information security control known as risk avoidance). This implies that organizations, IT systems and procedures should not demand excessive amounts of personal information or credentials for identification and authentication. Requiring, storing and processing personal identifiers (such as Social <b>Security</b> <b>number,</b> national <b>identification</b> <b>number,</b> driver's license number, credit card number, etc.) increases {{the risks of}} identity theft unless this valuable personal information is adequately secured at all times. Committing personal identifiers to memory is a sound practice that can reduce the risks of a would-be identity thief from obtaining these records. To help in remembering numbers such as social security numbers and credit card numbers, {{it is helpful to}} consider using mnemonic techniques or memory aids such as the mnemonic Major System.|$|R
