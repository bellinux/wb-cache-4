500|$|Actress Natalie Dormer, who {{was cast}} to play Queen Margaery Tyrell in the show's second season, also made her final {{appearance}} {{as a main}} cast member for the series. In contrast to Chapman, Dormer found out about her character's impending death approximately {{six months before the}} rest of the cast, saying [...] "I requested while making season 5 that showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss release me from working on the show earlier than usual so I could do another project, and they ended up phoning me — and that was The Call. But I got it six months ahead of normal. They were like, 'We weren't going to tell you this for a few more months, but we're not going to release you now, so you can't do that job {{you really want to do}} and we're really <b>sorry</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> But on the bright side, we are going to release you proper in the not-so-distant future.' It was good news, bad news — no you can't do this, but don't worry, you're going to have lots more opportunities very soon." [...] Dormer also stated about her departure, [...] "It's the longest time I've ever spent playing a character. I'll always have a little yellow rose after my heart, and I think it was just the right length of time, to be honest. It's time for the Westeros story to move on and it's a perfect time for her to exit." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 11, over 5,000 people {{marched in}} support of the {{striking}} hospital workers-including United Auto Workers president Walter Reuther and five U.S. Congressmen. Moultrie roused the crowd to a fever pitch by declaring, 'You thought we'd say 'Sorry, boss' and put those handkerchiefs back on our heads. <b>Sorry</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> governor, but we just had to disappoint you.' ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a thread}} on the {{official}} Message Boards of Douglas Adams' website, when a reader inquired about the specific mechanics of how the ending worked out, Adams responded: [...] "Ahem. All I {{can say is that}} it was as clear as day to me when I wrote it and now I can't figure it out myself. <b>Sorry</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I'm actually thinking about it at the moment as I've been re-reading the book in preparation for doing a screenplay.

2500|$|David Hammer, {{the lawyer}} who {{represented}} RDR Books, said, [...] "I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>about</b> the result, <b>that</b> the lexicon was {{not found to be}} sufficiently transformative, but I am happy the judge endorsed the genre of reference works and companion books as valuable and important and that authors don't have an automatic right to control what's written about their works." ...|$|R

As a matter of fact, that's why I shot over here in the first place. As an ambassador, don't you know. I told Jill all about it {{directly}} I saw her, but she seemed inclined to give it a miss rather, so I cabled old Derek to pop here in person. Seemed to me, don't you know, that Jill might be more likely to make it up and all that if she saw old Derek." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{document}} was online for only an hour, but {{long enough to}} be viewed by some readers. Soon after, the Houston Review, a conservative newspaper published by students at the University of Houston, printed the memo's full text and an accompanying commentary that criticized the paper. The Chronicle's response was initially muted. Its first official response appeared in the [...] "corrections" [...] section later the same week stating: [...] "An internal Houston Chronicle {{document was}} mistakenly posted to the editorial/opinion area of the Web site early Thursday morning. We apologize for any confusion it may have caused." [...] Chronicle editor Jeff Cohen, who gave a statement in defense of the memorandum: [...] "I make no apologies for having a thorough discussion of the issue. We have nothing to apologize for…There was an inadvertent posting of it to the Web site, and I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> but I make no apologies for the contents of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On one {{occasion}} Humph {{announced that they}} had a very distinguished actor as a guest who would join in the game of Mornington Crescent. When the game started, after great ceremony, the penultimate player, the last of the panellists, won on his first move, thus denying the distinguished guest the opportunity to make a single move. The chairman apologised but explained that this was an unavoidable possibility and the guest left without having uttered a word. The show was allegedly inundated with complaints at the treatment of Sir Alec Guinness as on the actual recording Lyttelton can be heard to say, [...] "Well I'm very <b>sorry</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Rather unfortunate. We would like to go on and ask you a few things about what you're doing currently, Sir Alec, but we do have to hurry on to the next game." [...] This story became a favourite of Lyttelton's, who claimed in interviews that the [...] "distinguished actor" [...] had never actually been named on the show.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{claiming}} {{that she would}} never return to EastEnders in 1997, Lawrence was upset when she discovered that both Sid Owen and Mike Reid (Ricky and Frank) were leaving EastEnders in 2000 as, in her opinion, it ruled out any chance of her character returning to the show. She commented, [...] "It would be great fun to get all the Butcher clan back for a few months. I hear Diane's name mentioned quite a lot on the show — it makes me feel like I've never really left. But all the people I'm connected with are leaving, which makes going back harder and I'm really <b>sorry</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> It would be great to have the Butcher clan come back for Mike's sendoff. But, sadly, I don't think there is the space for me to go back full-time." [...] In 2002, she was asked if she would ever return to the soap and she responded, [...] "If they asked me, I’d love to go back. Not on a long term contract or anything because I love doing other things but I’d definitely like to go back." ...|$|E

[...] Major Brian Weimer with the school's police department responded by saying, [...] "There is no Ku Klux Klan on campus." [...] Weimer {{also said that the}} National Guard was not on campus.

500|$|Two {{days after}} the sinking, on 11 February, U.S. President George W. Bush apologized for the {{accident}} on national television, stating, [...] "I want to reiterate what I said {{to the prime minister}} of Japan: [...] I'm deeply <b>sorry</b> <b>about</b> the accident <b>that</b> took place; our nation is sorry." [...] Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld also publicly apologized. [...] The U.S. ambassador to Japan, Tom Foley, personally apologized to both Prime Minister Mori and to the Emperor of Japan. The public apologies to the Japanese from the highest American officials stirred resentment among some American veterans of the Pacific War and their families, as well as among Asian victims of Imperial Japanese aggression and occupation. Richard Cohen wrote a column in the Washington Post, saying [...] "We've Apologized Enough to Japan", denounced the [...] "hypocrisy" [...] of Japan's recent gestures of compensation and remorse to some of its World War II victims, which he said were offered [...] "grudgingly", while noting that the U.S. had apologized profusely over the accidental collision.|$|R

But I wasn't meant for a banker; bankers are not so easy to kill. Don't you think I have been very easy to kill? It's not like a serious man. It's really very mortifying.

I was firmly resolved, when you left me in charge this morning, not to imagine anything, but keep my thoughts on facts. I did pretty well until I put the pie in, and then an irresistible temptation came to me to imagine I was an enchanted princess shut up in a lonely tower with a handsome knight riding to my rescue on a coal-black steed. So that is how I came to forget the pie. I didn't know I starched the handkerchiefs. All the time I was ironing I was trying to think of a name for a new island Diana and I have discovered up the brook. It's the most ravishing spot, Marilla. There are two maple trees on it and the brook flows right around it. At last it struck me that it would be splendid to call it Victoria Island because we found it on the Queen's birthday. Both Diana and I are very loyal. But I'm <b>sorry</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> pie and the handkerchiefs. I wanted to be extra good today because it's an anniversary. Do you remember what happened this day last year, Marilla?" ...|$|E
