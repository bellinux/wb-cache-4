5000|$|Bendon traded as a stamp dealer, {{first in}} the United Kingdom and later in Cyprus from where his first book on {{specimen}} stamps, UPU Specimen Stamps, was self-published in 1988. The book was the first worldwide account of the method <b>of</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>specimen</b> <b>stamps</b> {{among the members of}} the Universal Postal Union, earlier works having concentrated on the <b>stamps</b> <b>of</b> Britain or British Commonwealth countries. In 2015, an updated edition was published with colour illustrations and expanded content including a reprint in an appendix of the pioneering article [...] "The Distribution <b>of</b> <b>SPECIMEN</b> <b>Stamps</b> by the U.P.U." [...] by Marcus Samuel that originally appeared in Stamp Collecting in 1964/65.|$|R

5000|$|Samuel began {{collecting}} specimen stamps in 1924 {{when his father}} acquired a collection which contained many specimens.

He subsequently formed a comprehensive collection <b>of</b> <b>specimen</b> <b>stamps</b> {{at a time when}} few other collectors were interested in them. Dealers were pleased to sell him their unwanted stamps and one was quoted as saying [...] "The trouble with Marcus is that all his stamps are overprinted specimen".|$|R
50|$|Four {{unofficial}} {{issues were}} also produced in 1914; one consisting <b>of</b> overprinted Albanian <b>stamps</b> (six values), {{the other three}} bearing new designs of varied quality.

They were likely issued for publicity and propaganda purposes; their regular postal use is questionable, though cancelled <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> the Erseka and Moschopolis issues and examples <b>of</b> these <b>stamps</b> on covers exist.

In these upper regions of the ruin Rollo had a good opportunity to procure <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> marble and <b>of</b> <b>stamped</b> bricks, for in various places there, he found immense stores of bricks and marble, and other rubbish, piled up in square heaps under arches, or in great recesses among the ruins. Rollo selected some of the bricks which had stamps upon them, and then, with a piece of marble for a hammer, he contrived to break away all of the brick except the part which contained the stamp, and thus procured <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> a convenient form for carrying. These specimens he wrapped separately in pieces of newspaper, and put them in his pockets.|$|R
