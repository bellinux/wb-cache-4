It is shown that masking gives rise to tensile surface residual stresses adjacent to the peened area. Peening of austenitic stainless steel produces surface martensite in amounts that depend upon the composition of the steel. Transformation of retamed austenite on peening of carburised steel is found to give a substantial improvement in the surface and sub-surface residual stresses. <b>Shot</b> <b>peened</b> austenitic stainless steel is found to lose its compressive surface residual stress on fatigue testing at high levels of applied alternat-ing stress.

The finite element method was used to determine the actual strain at surface and facture mechanics parameters calculated from cracks emerged on the residual stress profile. The total fatigue life is obtained by adding initiation life, which is calculated by the strain-life model, with crack propagation life determined using da/dN curves.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{combining}} a compressed air jet with entrained hydroxyapatite (HA) particles with a jet of abrasive particles can be used to deposit a well adhered crystalline HA coatings onto titanium substrates. A similar particle bombardment process utilising a flow of <b>shot</b> <b>peen</b> particles and a flow of suitable powder particles has been used to deposit a range of coatings, though the deposition of bioceramic powders have not yet been reported by this method. In this study a direct comparison between the <b>shot</b> <b>peen</b> and abrasive bombardment processes has been undertaken to determine which technique yields coatings exhibiting higher levels of adhesion on titanium alloy substrates. Both processes were shown to effectively deposit a layer of crystalline apatite onto the titanium substrates over a range of pressures and jet to substrate heights. It was observed that for both processes that an increase in particle kinetic energy producing corresponding enhancements in both deposition rate and surface roughness. The <b>shot</b> <b>peen</b> process however produced a smooth layer of laminar apatite, which was readily removed from the surface using a scratch adhesion test technique. In contrast the combination of a jet of HA and abrasive powders resulted in an increase in surface abrasion and increased mechanical interlocking of the HA into the metal surface was observed. The mechano-chemical affect achieved resulted in a better adhered HA layer. The surface morphology obtained using the two treatments was significantly different with an increase in the average roughness (Ra) of ≈ 70 and 80 % for samples treated with abrasive particles over <b>shot</b> <b>peen.</b> This difference in surface treatment is further highlighted by the removal of the HA using an acid etch.

The structural model of the suspension arm was utilizing the solidworks. The finite element model and analysis were performed utilizing the finite element analysis code. In addition, the fatigue life was predicted using the strain-life approach subjected to variable amplitude loading. The three types of variable amplitude are considered in this project. TET 10 mesh and maximum principal stress were considered in the linear static stress analysis and the critical location was considered at node (6017).

The most widely used application are for engine valve springs (compression springs) due to high cyclic fatigue.
