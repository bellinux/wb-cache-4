40|$|Background The first {{commercial}} system for digital radiography {{was introduced in}} 1987, and it has evolved a great deal since then. Currently, {{it is possible to}} enhance images in digital radiography. Objectives The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of image enhancement in direct digital radiography as it relates to interproximal carries assessment. Materials and Methods Following extraction, 50 human teeth were kept in acidic gel (methyl cellulose + acetate buffer PH = 4. 8) for 42 days at 37 °C to cause caries before mounting. Direct digital radiography was then taken. Two filters were used: sharpen and emboss. Three radiologists evaluated the images with two weeks interval. The histologic assessments were gold standard. Additionally, SPSS 20 was used to draw an ROC curve and calculate AUC. Cohen’s kappa and interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to measure intra- and inter-observer reliability. Results For the emboss filter, sensitivity was 95 %, specificity was 100 %, and accuracy was 96 %. For the <b>sharpen</b> <b>filter,</b> sensitivity was 88 %, specificity was 100 %, and accuracy was 90 %. Also, the AUC for the emboss filter was 0. 97, and it was 0. 94 for the <b>sharpen</b> <b>filter.</b> Cohen’s simple kappa was in the range of excellent. Conclusions Using these filters in intra-oral direct digital radiography (especially the emboss filter) can help some clinicians to increase diagnostic accuracy in the assessment of inter proximal caries of posterior teeth...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{performance}} of photostimulable storage phosphor (PSP) radiographs with or without using the <b>sharpen</b> <b>filter</b> and cone beam CT (CBCT) for detecting enamel subsurface demineralization. Methods: Enamel subsurface demineralization was induced on one of the approximal surfaces of 120 sound human teeth. Standardized images of all teeth were acquired after the demineralization phase using the Digora (R) Optime (Orion Corp. /Soredex, Helsinki, Finland) (PSP) and the i-CAT (TM) (Imaging Sciences International, Hatfield, PA) (CBCT) systems. Three calibrated observers interpreted the images using a five-point scale (1, demineralization definitely absent; 2, demineralization probably absent; 3, unsure; 4, demineralization probably present; and 5, demineralization definitely present). Diagnoses were validated by cross-sectional microhardness profiling in the test areas of the approximal surfaces. Interobserver agreement was analysed using kappa statistics. Accuracy was estimated by the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (4,), which were compared using the Kruskal Wallis test (alpha = 5 %). Results: Interobserver agreement was higher for CBCT (kappa = 0. 7 - 0. 8), followed by sharpen-filtered (kappa = 0. 6 - 0. 7) and original (kappa = 0. 5 - 0. 6) images. CBCT presented the highest accuracy value (A(z) = 0. 897) compared with the original (A(z) = 0. 792) and sharpen-filtered (A(z) = 0. 712) images. However, no statistical differences were observed between the imaging modalities (p = 0. 0794). Conclusions: It can be concluded that PSP radiographs with or without using the <b>sharpen</b> <b>filter</b> and the CBCT images may be useful adjuncts for detecting subtle approximal enamel demineralization...|$|E

Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to compare the performance of digital radiography with and without enhancement filters for the detection of induced proximal caries lesions. The total sample consisted of 120 sound human teeth (40 premolars, 80 molars). Enamel subsurface demineralization was induced in one of the proximal surfaces of 60 teeth. Standardized radiographs of all teeth were acquired after the demineralization phase using the Digora-Optime (R) system. Four radiologists examined the digital radiographs and applied the following filters provided by the Digora (R) for Windows 2. 6 package: Negative, Sharpen and both (Negative plus Sharpen). Validation of radiographic diagnosis was carried out by Knoop cross-sectional micro-hardness profiling on the proximal surfaces. Intraobserver agreement was estimated using Kappa statistics (k). Sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy were compared using ANOVA/Tukey test (alpha = 5 %). Intraobserver agreement ranged from good to very good/optimal (k: 0. 65 - 0. 83). Although not statistically significant, the highest sensitivity (0. 68 +/- 0. 22) and accuracy (0. 76 +/- 0. 16) values were observed using the <b>Sharpen</b> <b>filter</b> as opposed to the Negative filter, which presented the lowest performance indices (0. 57 +/- 0. 13 and 0. 70 +/- 0. 10, respectively).

40|$|Abstract. We {{analyze the}} problem of reconstructing a 2 D {{function}} that approximates a set of desired gradients and a data term. The combined data and gradient terms enable operations like modifying the gradients of an image while staying close to the original image.

Analysis of this equation in the Fourier domain leads to a direct, exact, and efficient solution to the problem. Further analysis reveals {{the structure of the}} spatial filters that solve the 2 D screened Poisson equation and shows gradient scaling to be a well-defined <b>sharpen</b> <b>filter</b> that generalizes Laplacian sharpening, which itself can be mapped to gradient domain filtering.

Digital enhancement of contrast and brightness was performed and a X 2 digital zoom was utilised. The grades from the unenhanced and enhanced digitised images were compared with the same retinal fields viewed as slides.  RESULTS—Overall agreement in retinopathy grade from the digitised images improved from 83. 3 % (125 / 150) to 94. 0 % (141 / 150) with sight threatening diabetic retinopathy (STDR) correctly identified in 95. 5 % (84 / 88) and 98. 9 % (87 / 88) of cases when using unenhanced and enhanced images respectively. In total, five images were overgraded and four undergraded from the enhanced images compared with 17  and eight images respectively when using unenhanced images.  CONCLUSION—This study demonstrates that the already good agreement in grading performance can be further improved by software manipulation or processing of digitised retinal images. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{last decade}} has {{witnessed}} an explosive use of medical images and Electronics Patient Record (EPR) {{in the healthcare}} sector for facilitating the sharing of patient information and exchange between networked hospitals and healthcare centers. To guarantee the security, authenticity and management of medical images and information through storage and distribution, the watermarking techniques are growing to protect the medical healthcare information. This paper presents a technique for embedding the EPR information in the medical image to save storage space and transmission overheads and to guarantee security of the shared data. In this paper a new method for protecting the patient information in which the information is embedded as a watermark in the discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) of the medical image using the hospital logo as a reference image. The patient information is coded by an error correcting code (ECC), BCH code, to enhance the robustness of the proposed method. The scheme is blind so that the EPR can be extracted from the medical image without the need of the original image. Therefore, this proposed technique is useful in telemedicine applications. Performance of the proposed method was tested using four modalities of medical images; MRA, MRI, Radiological, and CT. Experimental results showed no visible difference between the watermarked and the original image. Moreover, the proposed watermarking method is robust against {{a wide range of}} attacks such as JPEG coding, Gaussian noise addition, histogram equalization, gamma correction, contrast adjustment, and <b>sharpen</b> <b>filter</b> and rotation...|$|E

40|$|Figure 1 : The figure shows image {{enhancement}} filters {{we have created}} or improved upon using our optimization framework. Our framework is designed for expressing image and video processing applications that can account for certain perceptual biases of the human visual system. We present an optimization framework for expressing image processing applications that can account for three perceptual biases of the human visual system (HVS) already well-known in the perception literature. (1) The perception literature is ripe with studies demonstrating the HVS {{to be more sensitive}} to local pixel gradients than absolute pixel values, which has led to some important work in gradient-domain image-filtering. Inspired by this work, our optimization framework allows image and video processing applications to easily specify both zeroth order constraints (i. e., desired pixel values) and first order constraints (i. e., desired pixel gradients in space and time) in the optimization. (2) We introduce a spatiallyvarying weighting scheme for these constraints that reduces artifacts by approximating the more robust L 1 -norm even when using a simple weighted least squares optimization. (3) We also demonstrate that edge length in addition to local gradient magnitude is a useful measure of local gradient saliency. Our saliency measure is inspired by perception studies that show long coherent edges in an image, even when faint, are perceptually salient to the HVS. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our formulation in creating effective yet simple to implement solutions for common image processing tasks. To exercise our formulation we have created a new saliency-based <b>sharpen</b> <b>filter</b> and a pseudo image relighting application.
