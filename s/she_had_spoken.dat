At some point before falling asleep, she recalled, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>spoken</b> to Farrar, who had phoned asking which member of the {{household}} had paged him. She {{told police that}} she and Farrar {{were in the process of}} divorce, though she did not know how far along they were, and that although the children were very upset at the prospect, she herself was not and was looking forward to being able to rebuild her life.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, the Duchess {{launched}} the Big Bone walk campaign, leading 90 children and osteoporosis sufferers for a 10-mile walk and climb around Loch Muick at the Balmoral Estate in Scotland {{to raise money}} for the charity. The campaign raised £200,000 and continues almost every year as one of the fundraisers for the charity. In 2011, she appeared in the BBC Radio drama The Archers, playing herself, to raise the profile of the disease, and in 2013 teamed up with the television series Strictly Come Dancing to raise funds for the National Osteoporosis Society.

Almost every year, the Duchess attends and partakes in World Osteoporosis Day, by attending events around the UK on 20 October. She continues to attend conferences around the world and meets with health experts to further discuss the disease.|$|E

[...] The track [...] "Freedun" [...] features vocals by former One Direction member Zayn Malik, although the two did not actually meet during its recording. [...] M.I.A. stated that she had written the song at a much earlier date but had previously deemed it [...] "a bit too mainstream sounding" [...] for her to record, {{but that it was}} well-suited to the collaboration with Malik. [...] She also stated that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>spoken</b> to Popcaan and Rihanna about collaborating on the album, but that neither opportunity had come to fruition.|$|E

500|$|The {{remainder}} of the trial was spent on this last charge. [...] The prosecution intended to demonstrate that Hutchinson had made disparaging remarks about the colony's ministers, {{and to use the}} October meeting as their evidence. [...] Six ministers had presented to the court their written versions of the October conference, and Hutchinson agreed with the substance of their statements. [...] Her defence was that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>spoken</b> reluctantly and in private, that she [...] "must either speak false or true in my answers" [...] in the ministerial context of the meeting. [...] In those private meetings, she had cited Proverbs 29:25, [...] "The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe." [...] The court was not interested in her distinction between public and private statements.|$|E
500|$|The pirates {{reportedly}} {{then set}} course for Eyl. Eyl official Abdullahi Saed Yusuf said that [...] "We are powerless to help," [...] while a French military spokesman {{announced that the}} French Navy and base at Djibouti were [...] "on standby, ready to intervene." [...] A contradictory report from the East African Seafarers' Assistance Programme stated that the Delannes had been moved to a pirate base in the Xaabo mountains, and that the pirates were using the Carré d'As IV as a [...] "decoy vessel" [...] to attract more victim ships. The couple's daughter, Alizee, claimed on Tahitian radio that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>spoken</b> with her parents on a satellite phone, {{and that they were}} [...] "fine". According to another press account, a feud developed between Yacub and the pirates' sponsor, [...] "Shire," [...] a Puntland organized crime figure who belonged to a different clan; on September 12, Yacub sailed for Eyl, prompting a [...] overland pursuit by Shire's men that ended at Ras Hafun.|$|E
500|$|Despite her largely demure {{public persona}} as a {{traditional}} wife and homemaker, Nixon was not as self-effacing and timid as her critics often claimed. When a news photographer wanted her to strike yet another pose while wearing an apron, she firmly responded, [...] "I think we've had enough of this kitchen thing, don't you?" [...] Some journalists, such as columnist and White House Correspondent Robert Thompson felt that Pat was an ideal balance for the 1970s; Thompson wrote that she proved that [...] "women can {{play a vital role}} in world affairs" [...] while still retaining a [...] "feminine manner." [...] Other journalists felt that Pat represented the failings of the feminine mystique, and portrayed her as being out of step with her times. Those who opposed the Vietnam War identified her with the Nixon administration's policies, and, as a result, occasionally picketed her speaking events. After <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>spoken</b> to some of them, though, one student told the press that [...] "she wanted to listen. I felt like this is a woman who really cares about what we are doing. I was surprised." [...] Veteran CBS correspondent Mike Wallace expressed regret that the one major interview he was never able to conduct was that of Pat Nixon.|$|E

500|$|Twenty-six people, mainly police officers, {{were interviewed}} in 1998 {{as part of}} the {{subsequent}} PIC inquiry. Several witnesses from the party, as well as Webster, Wilson and NC1 were also questioned. The inquiry heard allegations that police assaulted four people during interviews: Webster, Wilson, NC1 and another unnamed suspect referred to as NC5, a relative of Webster who was 17 {{at the time of the}} murder. Admitting to the inquiry that he killed Leigh and insisting that he was alone in doing so, Webster stated that police repeatedly punched and kicked him when he refused to confess to her murder. According to Scott Tucker writing in The Newcastle Herald, police were also accused of threatening violence, falsifying reports and withholding evidence; one of the officers being investigated had his police locker raided by internal affairs, who discovered several records on the murder that had previously been listed as missing. Carrington was also summoned to give evidence, though she was not informed why; her book, Who Killed Leigh Leigh, which criticised police over their handling of the investigation, had been released earlier that year. Carrington was cross-examined for three days, longer than any of the police officers who were questioned, in what was described by Hillary Byrne-Armstrong as [...] "an inquisition on just about every word <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>spoken</b> [...] written" [...] in relation to Leigh's murder". Byrne-Armstrong accused the PIC of summoning Carrington for the sole purpose of attacking her credibility on issues they had no intention of investigating, and to discredit someone who had attracted considerable media attention for criticising police.|$|E
2500|$|She said, [...] "It is {{one thing}} for me to come before a public magistracy and there to speak what they would have me speak and another when a man comes to me in a way of {{friendship}} privately." [...] Hutchinson's defense was that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>spoken</b> only reluctantly and in private, and that she [...] "must either speak false or true in my answers" [...] in the ministerial context of the meeting. [...] The court, however, did not make any distinction between public and private statements.|$|E

But I don't want to pre-empt in any way President Karzai's statement, which will set the stage for how we go forward in the next stage of this." [...] An unnamed diplomatic source also said that Karzai would be making a nationwide address flanked by U.S. Senator John Kerry and U.N. Special Representative to Afghanistan Kai Eide, and claimed that Karzai was prepared to make concessions, such as forming a power-sharing coalition or agreeing to a run-off.|$|E

2500|$|Gonzales {{filed suit}} in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against Castle Rock, Colorado, its police department, and the three {{individual}} police officers with whom <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>spoken</b> under 42 U.S.C. §1983, claiming a federally protected property interest in enforcement of the restraining order and alleging [...] "an official policy or custom of failing to respond properly to complaints of restraining order violations." [...] A motion to dismiss the case was granted, and Gonzales appealed to the Denver, Colorado Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. A panel of that court rejected Gonzales's substantive due process claim but found a procedural due process claim; an en banc rehearing reached the same conclusion. The court also affirmed {{the finding that the}} three individual officers had qualified immunity and as such could not be sued.|$|E
