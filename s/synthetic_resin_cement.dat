40|$|A {{problem of}} current {{practical}} {{interest to the}} field of Aeronautics is whether cement coatings associated with strain gages and fatigue warning indicators have appreciable effect upon fatigue characteristics. Fatigue tests in rotary bending were conducted at room temperature, 200 [degrees]F and 400 [degrees]F on plain specimens of 2014 -T and 7075 -T and specimens coated with a synthetic resin lacquer, a <b>synthetic</b> <b>resin</b> <b>cement,</b> and an epoxy resin cement. The effect of these coatings was slight at room temperature, falling within the scatter band, but apparently affording a small increase in fatigue life.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the degree of {{conversion}} (DC), Vickers microhardness (VH) and elastic modulus (E) of <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> cured through different ceramic systems. One 1. 5 -mm-thick disc of each ceramic system (feldspathic, lithium dissilicate and zircônia veneered with feldspathic) was used. Three dual-cured (Allcem, Variolink II and RelyX U 200) and one chemically-cured (Multilink) <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> were activated through ceramic discs. For dual-cured <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> was used a conventional halogen light-curing unit (Optilux 501 at 650 mW/cm 2 for 120 s). Samples cured without the ceramic disc were used as control. The samples were stored at 37 °C for 24 h. ATR/FTIR spectrometry was used to evaluate the extent of polymerization in the samples (n= 5). Micromechanical properties - VH and E - of the <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> (n= 5) were measured with a dynamic indentation test. Data were statistically analyzed with two-way ANOVA, Tukey's test and Pearson's correlation (&# 945;= 0. 05). DC was affected only by the type of <b>resin</b> <b>cement</b> (p= 0. 001). For VH, significant interaction was detected between <b>resin</b> <b>cement</b> and ceramic (p= 0. 045). The dual-cured <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> showed no significant differences in mean values for E and significantly higher values than the chemically-cured <b>resin</b> <b>cement.</b> The degree of conversion and the mechanical properties of the evaluated <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> depend on their activation mode and the type of ceramics used in 1. 5 mm thickness.

Following the adhesive resin application on ceramic disk surface, <b>resin</b> <b>cement</b> cylinders were produced. After 24 h, the mu SBS test was performed (n= 8), a shear load was applied at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min until failure and fracture patterns were determined. <b>Resin</b> <b>cement</b> DC analysis was performed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (n= 5). Data were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey test (alpha= 0. 05). The interaction of adhesive protocol and ceramic type significantly affected the micro-shear bond strength and <b>resin</b> <b>cement</b> DC (p < 0. 0001). For the FLC, adhesive protocols containing the conventional <b>resin</b> <b>cement</b> produced higher mu SBS values compared to the remaining protocols. For the LDC, the combination of the conventional <b>resin</b> <b>cement</b> and an adhesive resin containing photoactivators produced higher mu SBS compared to the other tested adhesive protocols.

Cements were either: 1) not exposed to light (chemical activation = self-cured groups) or 2) photoactivated through mylar strips (chemical and photo-activation = dual-cured groups) (n = 10). After a 24 h storage in 37 masculineC distilled water, specimens were subjected to compressive load in a testing machine. A self-curing <b>resin</b> <b>cement</b> (Cement-It) and a zinc phosphate cement served as controls.

30|$|For {{cementation}} to zirconia without separate primer application before luting, bonding efficacy depends {{entirely on}} the luting agent and its mechanical stability [24]. Regular bis-GMA <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> which do not contain the MDP itself may show low bond strength values. However, RelyX U 200 cement contains methacrylate monomers with phosphoric ester functional groups (MDP) and these functional monomers of RelyX U 200 cement are able to form hydrogen bonds with zirconium oxide surfaces, enhancing adhesion and bond strength [26 – 28]. Significantly higher bond strength values between lithium disilicate ceramic and self adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cement</b> was also stated.

40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Self-adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> were {{designed}} to bond without any pretreatment of dentin. However, pretreatments such as the application of desensitizing resin or the resin sealing of dentin with priming/bonding solutions might influence the bonding quality of these self-adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cements.</b> Little {{is known about the}} effect of dentin pretreatment on the bond quality of self-adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cements.</b> PURPOSE: This study evaluated whether dentin desensitizing or sealing methods influenced the shear bond strength of 1 self-adhesive and 2 conventional <b>resin</b> <b>cements.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS: One-hundred and eighty human molars were assigned to 5 different pretreatment groups: 1) freshly ground dentin, 2) glutaraldehyde/hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) desensitized dentin (Gluma), 3) contamination of desensitized dentin with provisional cement, 4) sealed dentin (dual bonding technique), and 5) contamination of sealed dentin with provisional cement. The shear bond strength of a self-adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cement</b> (RelyX Unicem; RXU) and 2 conventional <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> (Variolink II; VAR, Panavia 21; PAN) was assessed for each pretreatment group (n= 12 per cement types). Two-way ANOVA and 1 -way ANOVA together with the post hoc Tukey multiple comparison (α=. 05) were performed. RESULTS: On freshly ground dentin, PAN exhibited the highest shear bond strength values (P<. 001). The use of the glutaraldehyde/HEMA resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} bond strength of RXU as compared to fresh dentin (P<. 001). Resin sealing of dentin increased the bond strength of RXU but had no significant effect on VAR or PAN. RXU exhibited the highest mean bond strength after the contamination of resin-sealed dentin by provisional cement.

Thishas led to {{greater use of}} adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> to provide strength for all-ceramic restorations and to ensure secure attachment to the tooth. 1, 2 Cements with adhesive properties have a distinct advantage because of their poten-tial to reduce microleakage and associated sequelae. Porcelain veneers, ceramic inlays and onlays, and adhesive fixed partial dentures became predictable treatment options only {{with the development of}} <b>resin</b> <b>cements.</b> The retention of conventional indirect restorations and fixed prostheses can be improved with the use of adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cements.</b> 3, 4 Such cements provide better retention for short crown 3 and short post 4 preparations in vitro when adjunctive retentive design features are inadequate. <b>Resin</b> luting <b>cements</b> also exhibit low solubility. Numerous proprietary <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> and bonding agents are available, and in vitro assessment is essential to determine optimal performance. There have been anecdotal reports 5, 6 of low bond strength with autocured (AC) resin composite materials, particularly when light-cured (LC) bonding agents that combine primer and adhesive in a 1 -bottle preparation are used. These reports led to speculation that some bonding agents and <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> may be incompatible an...|$|R
30|$|Self-adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> {{present a}} series of {{advantages}} on the bond of fiber posts, e.g. reduced clinical chair time, as they do not require any pre-treatment of the dental substrate, and elimination of the following steps: priming and air-drying for solvent evaporation [18 – 20]. However, {{the results of the}} present study showed that 5.25 % NaOCl, either with or without 17 % EDTA, affected the bond strength between self-adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cement</b> and root canal dentin. Eventually, 2 % CHX gel promoted a more favorable condition to the cementation of fiber posts with self-adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cement</b> than 5.25 % NaOCl, and should be preferred in the root canal biomechanical preparation, without a final application of 17 % EDTA, when a fiber post is planned to be <b>cemented</b> with self-adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cement.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{pre-treatment}} of dentin {{surface with}} CHX {{has been shown}} to reduce the bond strength of self-adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> to dentin [14]. On the other hand, a final rinse with CHX did not affect the immediate push-out bond strength in post bond cementation with self-adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> [15]. However, the performance of chemical substances used for biomechanical preparation of the root canals on the bond strength of self-etching adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> remains unknown. Hence, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of the substances used as endodontic auxiliary chemical substances, 5.25 % NaOCl and 2 % CHX gel and their association with 17 % EDTA on the retention of fiber posts luted using a self-adhesive cement. The study tested the null hypothesis that endodontic substances do not affect the bond strength of fiber posts <b>cemented</b> with self-adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cement.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: No {{specific}} indications {{about the}} pre-treatment of indirect composite restorations {{is provided by}} the manufacturers of most self-adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cements.</b> The potential effect of silane treatment to the bond strength of the complete tooth/indirect restoration complex is not available. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the contribution of different surface treatments on microtensile bond strength of composite overlays to dentin using several self-adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> and a total-etch one. Material and Methods: Composite overlays were fabricated and bonding surfaces were airborne-particle abraded and randomly assigned to two different surface treatments: no treatment or silane application (RelyX Ceramic Primer) followed by an adhesive (Adper Scotchbond 1 XT). Composite overlays were luted to flat dentin surfaces using the following self-adhesive resin cements: RelyX Unicem, G-Cem, Speedcem, Maxcem Elite or Smartcem 2, and the total-etch <b>resin</b> <b>cement</b> RelyX ARC. After 24 h, bonded specimens were cut into sticks 1 mm thick and stressed in tension until failure. Two-way ANOVA and SNK tests were applied at α= 0. 05. Results: Bond strength values were significantly influenced by the <b>resin</b> <b>cement</b> used (p 0. 05). All self-adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> showed lower bond strength values than the total-etch RelyX ARC. Among self-adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cements,</b> RelyX Unicem and G-Cem attained statistically higher bond strength values. Smartcem 2 and Maxcem Elite exhibited 80 - 90 % of pre-test failures. Conclusions: The silane and adhesive application after indirect resin composite sandblasting did not improve the bond strength of dentin-composite overlay complex.

40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the tensile bond durability of two different types of 4 -META containing <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> over a period of 3 years. Methods: Ten bovine dentin specimens were tested for tensile bond strengths with each of the following materials: Super Bond C&B: unfilled methyl methacrylate (MMA) /polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) <b>resin</b> <b>cement,</b> MASA Bond (experimental material) : filled dimethacrylate <b>resin</b> <b>cement</b> at 1 day, 6 months, 1 and 3 years. The mean bond strengths were compared statistically by two-way ANOVA and Fisher's PLSD test (P 0. 05) during the experimental periods, the 1 -day bond strengths were significantly greater than those at the other experimental periods except for 6 months (P< 0. 05). Regarding the fracture modes, at 6 months and 1 year, statistical differences were observed between Super Bond C&B and MASA Bond (P< 0. 05). Significance: The bond strengths of both <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> to dentin significantly decreased after 6 months, and the long-term failure patterns of the 4 -META/TBB <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> showed a marked change. © 2002 Academy of Dental Materials.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of adhesive primer applications on the bond strength of <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> to cast titanium. Four adhesive primers - Metaltite, Metal Primer II, Alloy Primer and Ceramic Primer - and their respective <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> - Bistite II DC, Link Max, Panavia F 2. 0, RelyX Unicem and RelyX ARC - were tested. Cast plates were prepared from titanium ingots (n= 6 specimens/cement) and had their surfaces airborne-particle abraded with Al 2 O 3 (50 &# 956; m). Three <b>resin</b> <b>cement</b> cylinders were built on each bonded titanium surface, using a cylindrical translucent tubing mold and were subjected to micro-shear testing. Data were analyzed statistically by two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test (&# 945;= 0. 05). The application of Metal Primer II and Ceramic Primer resulted in significant higher bond strength for Link Max and RelyX Unicem <b>resin</b> <b>cements,</b> respectively, than nonuse of adhesive primers. Panavia F 2. 0 and RelyX ARC yielded high bond strength means with or without adhesive primers.
