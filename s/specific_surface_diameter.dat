40|$|International audienceExperimental Determination and Modeling of the Radiative Properties of Silica Nanoporous Matrices Superinsulating {{materials}} are currently of interest because the {{heating and cooling}} of houses and offices are responsible for {{an important part of}} CO 2 emissions. In this study, we aim at modeling the radiative transfer in nanoporous silica matrices that are the principal components of nanoporous superinsulating materials. We first elaborate samples from different pyrogenic amorphous silica powders that slightly differ one from another in terms of <b>specific</b> <b>surface,</b> nanoparticle <b>diameter,</b> and composition. The various samples are optically characterized using two spectrometers operating on the wavelength range (250 nm; 20 ␮m). Once the hemispherical transmittance and reflectance spectra are measured, we deduce the radiative properties using a parameter identification technique. Then, as the considered media are made of packed quasispherical nanoparticles, we try to model their radiative properties using the original Mie theory. To obtain a good agreement between experiment and theory on {{a large part of the}} wavelength range, we have to consider scatterers that are up to five times larger than the primary nanopar-ticles; this is attributed to the fact that the scatterers are not the nanoparticles but aggregates of nanoparticles that are constituted during the fabrication process of the powders. Nevertheless, in the small wavelength range (␭ smaller than 1 ␮m), we can never get a satisfactory agreement using the Mie theory. This disagreement is attributed to the fact that the original Mie theory does not take into account the nanostructure of the aggregates. So we have developed a code based on the discrete dipole approximation that improves the modeling results in the small wavelength range, basing our computations on aggregates generated using the diffusion-limited cluster-cluster aggregation algorithm in order to ensure a fractal dimension close to what is usually found with aggregates of silica nanoparticles...|$|R

Milk was homogenized at pressures ranging from 17. 2 MPa to 100 MPa to determine the effect of homogenization pressure on the fat globule size distribution, viscosity, color, and temperature changes in milk. Milk containing 0, 1. 5 and 3. 0 % milk fat was heated to 62. 5 and 79. 5 'C and homogenized using a Rannie Model 12. 51 H double stage homogenizer. The difference in whiteness between unhomogenized milk and homogenized milk was significant. Homogenization appeared to have a slight effect on the viscosity of milk. Homogenization increased the temperature of milk an average of 3 'C ? 1. 5 'C per 17. 2 MPa. Increasing homogenizing pressure at 62. 5 'C reduced fat globule size which was reflected in the reduction of the volume <b>surface</b> average <b>diameter</b> and tenth percentile parameter and increased <b>specific</b> <b>surface</b> area.

The established objectives consist on determine the unknown components, obtaining them separately, and assay different combinations in order to optimize the enzymatic cocktail avoiding antagonisms and promoting synergisms. In the present study, the laboratory has been able to know the two main enzymes of the cocktail, and nanofibers have been obtained applying different combinations and enzymatic proportions. Then, nanofibers have been characterized in terms of: nanofibrillation yield, transmittance, carboxyl content, cationic demand, <b>specific</b> <b>surface</b> and <b>diameter.</b> Moreover, it has been tried to produce hydrogels with nanofibers obtained applying the commercial treatment, since these nanofibers have shown greatest characteristics. Therefore, the principal objective consisting on optimizing the enzymatic cocktail has not been accomplished.

Based on this fact, some hypotheses have arisen, these include the fact that maybe there is another key enzyme, or the possibility that the enzymatic proportions facilitated by the commercial company were distorted. These unsatisfactory values have been reflected when producing hydrogels, since they rapidly disintegrated when were submerged in water.
