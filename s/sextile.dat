40|$|Association of urinary pH {{with body}} weight in nephrolithiasis. BackgroundThe {{prevalence}} of kidney stone {{disease in the}} United States is progressively increasing, paralleling the growing rate of obesity. Uric acid nephrolithiasis, a condition associated with a low urinary pH, {{has been linked to}} obesity and insulin resistance. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that urinary pH may be inversely associated to body weight in nephrolithiasis. MethodsData were retrieved from 4883 patients with nephrolithiasis who underwent ambulatory evaluation at two established stone clinics in Dallas and Chicago. The patients collected 24 -hour urine samples on an outpatient basis, while avoiding any drug that could alter urinary pH. Patients were divided in increasing <b>sextiles</b> of body weight, and urinary pH was adjusted for urinary creatinine and for age. ResultsUrinary pH had a strong, graded inverse association with body weight. Urinary creatinine and age were both found to be significant covariates of urinary pH, while gender was not a significant independent variable after adjustment for urinary creatinine. Mean 24 -hour urinary pH, adjusted for age and urinary creatinine, were 6. 09, 6. 04, 6. 01, 5. 99, 5. 97, and 5. 91 for <b>sextiles</b> of body weight in increasing order from Dallas (P for linear trend < 0. 0001), and 6. 18, 6. 10, 6. 04, 6. 02, 5. 97, and 5. 88 for the <b>sextiles</b> from Chicago (P for linear trend < 0. 0001). ConclusionWe conclude that urinary pH is inversely related to body weight among patients with stones. The results confirm the previously proposed scheme that obesity may sometimes cause uric acid nephrolithiasis by producing excessively acid urine due to insulin resistance...|$|R

First and foremost, less weight is assigned to the outliers in this method than in the moment estimates, and the PM estimators can still be calculated when moments do not exist. Second, the validity of this method is seriously restricted {{because of the lack of}} a theoretical justification in the selection of a specific set of percentiles. Third, the <b>sextiles</b> utilized in our experiments have brought about adequate results for symmetric distributions.|$|R
30|$|Infructescence {{length is}} an easy {{criterion}} for farmers to differentiate between plants. Our results showed that plants with higher infructescence length (in the higher <b>sextiles)</b> at pruning {{were more likely to}} have produced slips at pruning time (Figure  3) and produced more slips than plants with lower infructescence length (Figure  4). The higher number of slips will be related to more assimilates available in these plants and/or a better nutrient status (cf. Malézieux and Bartholomew 2003; Swete Kelly 1993). This also suggests that plants in Expt 1 –with slightly higher fruit and infructescence weight– had a better nutritional status than those in Expt 2 at the moment of pruning, what is in line with findings by Fassinou Hotegni et al. (2014 b) who showed a positive association between the plant vigor at flowering induction and the slip number, fruit weight and infructescence weight at the moment of fruit harvest.|$|R

40|$|CEO as {{the most}} senior {{executive}} carries vast responsibility of the company's operations and decision making, including decisions on M&A transactions. Thus, various CEO traits may influence the corporate decision making, as also prior literature suggests. This research focuses on studying the effect of CEO age on M&A propensity. Younger CEOs can be hypothesized to be more prone to M&A transactions, as their personal compensation gain is bigger than the compensation gain for older CEOs, as Yim (2013) explains her results that show the pioneering effect of the acquisitiveness of youth. I add to Yim's (2013) findings by studying the effect with a data set compiled from a longer time period and moreover, by studying {{the differences in the}} CEO age effect across industries and different market circumstances. Differences are anticipated to be found due to young CEOs' quicker adaptability to changed market conditions and pursue for personal compensation gains in the more favorable M&A circumstances. The data is extracted from various sources. The final data set consist of 2617 unique firm-year observations of US headquartered companies within the 20 -year time frame of 1993 - 2012. This sample includes 144 companies, 474 CEOs and 716 M&A transactions. The data set is used in a number of regression models, yet the logistic models being the primary method for investigating the CEO age effect. The dependent variable in this research is a binary variable indicating if the company and CEO have acquired at least one other firm during the respective observation year or not. The CEO age effect is studied by observing age as a count variable, in <b>sextiles,</b> and in interaction with industry dummies and year dummies to compare if the magnitude of the effect varies in divergent circumstances. I find a decrease in M&A propensity for ageing CEOs until the age of 62. The likelihood for an acquisition in a particular year reaches 40 % for 36 -year-old CEOs and declines to 17 % for the least acquisitive 62 -year-old executives. This 26 -year increase in age represents a 58 % decrease in M&A propensity. Surprisingly however, I find that after passing the age of 62 M&A propensity starts to increase, and a further 18 -year increase in CEO age increases the M&A propensity with a marginal effect of 59 %, as an 80 -year old CEO has an M&A propensity estimate of 27 %. Thus, young CEOs are shown to be more prone to pursuing acquisitions, maybe due to the larger personal compensation gains, as expected. The novel finding of the increased M&A propensity of old CEOs {{can be explained by the}} approaching retirement causing executives to pursue one last compensation gain and monument building. I find no evidence for CEOs exploiting more favorable market circumstances. The effect of CEO age is not shown to vary across industries, and furthermore I find no support for an emphasized age effect during more favorable times when the M&A market is considered to be hot...|$|R

[...] My Substitutes I send ye, and Create [...] Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might [...] Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now [...] My hold of this new Kingdom all depends, [...] Through Sin to Death expos'd by my exploit. [...] If your joynt power prevaile, th' affaires of Hell [...] No detriment need feare, goe and be strong. [...] So saying he dismiss'd them, they with speed [...] 410 [...] Thir course through thickest Constellations held [...] Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan, [...] And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips [...] Then sufferd. Th' other way Satan went down [...] The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side [...] Disparted Chaos over built exclaimd, [...] And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild, [...] That scorn'd his indignation: through the Gate, [...] Wide open and unguarded, Satan pass'd, [...] And all about found desolate; for those [...] 420 [...] Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge, [...] Flown to the upper World; the rest were all [...] Farr to the inland retir'd, about the walls [...] Of Pandemonium, Citie and proud seate [...] Of Lucifer, so by allusion calld, [...] Of that bright Starr to Satan paragond. [...] There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand [...] In Council sate, sollicitous what chance [...] Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee [...] Departing gave command, and they observ'd. [...] 430 [...] As when the Tartar from his Russian Foe [...] By Astracan over the Snowie Plaines [...] Retires, or Bactrian Sophi from the hornes [...] Of Turkish Crescent, leaves all waste beyond [...] The Realme of Aladule, in his retreate [...] To Tauris or Casbeen. So these the late [...] Heav'n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell [...] Many a dark League, reduc't in careful Watch [...] Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting [...] Each hour their great adventurer from the search [...] 440 [...] Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt, [...] In shew plebeian Angel militant [...] Of lowest order, past; and from the dore [...] Of that Plutonian Hall, invisible [...] Ascended his high Throne, which under state [...] Of richest texture spred, at th' upper end [...] Was plac't in regal lustre. Down a while [...] He sate, and round about him saw unseen: [...] At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head [...] And shape Starr bright appeer'd, or brighter, clad [...] 450 [...] With what permissive glory since his fall [...] Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz'd [...] At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng [...] Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish'd beheld, [...] Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th' acclaime: [...] Forth rush'd in haste the great consulting Peers, [...] Rais'd from thir dark Divan, and with like joy [...] Congratulant approach'd him, who with hand [...] Silence, and with these words attention won. [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, [...] 460 [...] For in possession such, not onely of right, [...] I call ye and declare ye now, returnd [...] Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth [...] Triumphant out of this infernal Pit [...] Abominable, accurst, the house of woe, [...] And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess, [...] As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven [...] Little inferiour, by my adventure hard [...] With peril great atchiev'd. Long were to tell [...] What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine [...] 470 [...] Voyag'd the unreal, vast, unbounded deep [...] Of horrible confusion, over which [...] By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav'd [...] To expedite your glorious march; but I [...] Toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride [...] Th' untractable Abysse, plung'd in the womb [...] Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wilde, [...] That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd [...] My journey strange, with clamorous uproare [...] Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found [...] 480 [...] The new created World, which fame in Heav'n [...] Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful [...] Of absolute perfection, therein Man [...] Plac't in a Paradise, by our exile [...] Made happie: Him by fraud I have seduc'd [...] From his Creator, and the more to increase [...] Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat [...] Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up [...] Both his beloved Man and all his World, [...] To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us, [...] 490 [...] Without our hazard, labour or allarme, [...] To range in, and to dwell, and over Man [...] To rule, as over all he should have rul'd. [...] True is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather [...] Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape [...] Man I deceav'd: that which to mee belongs, [...] Is enmity, which he will put between [...] Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel; [...] His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: [...] A World who would not purchase with a bruise, [...] 500 [...] Or much more grievous pain? Ye have th' account [...] Of my performance: What remaines, ye Gods, [...] But up and enter now into full bliss. [...] So having said, a while he stood, expecting [...] Thir universal shout and high applause [...] To fill his eare, when contrary he hears [...] On all sides, from innumerable tongues [...] A dismal universal hiss, the sound [...] Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long [...] Had leasure, wondring at himself now more; [...] 510 [...] His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare, [...] His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining [...] Each other, till supplanted down he fell [...] A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone, [...] Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power [...] Now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd, [...] According to his doom: he would have spoke, [...] But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue [...] To forked tongue, for now were all transform'd [...] Alike, to Serpents all as accessories [...] 520 [...] To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din [...] Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now [...] With complicated monsters, head and taile, [...] Scorpion and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire, [...] Cerastes hornd, Hydrus, and Ellops drear, [...] And Dipsas (Not so thick swarm'd once the Soil [...] Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle [...] Ophiusa) but still greatest hee the midst, [...] Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun [...] Ingenderd in the Pythian Vale on slime, [...] 530 [...] Huge Python, and his Power no less he seem'd [...] Above the rest still to retain; they all [...] Him follow'd issuing forth to th' open Field, [...] Where all yet left of that revolted Rout [...] Heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array, [...] Sublime with expectation when to see [...] In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief; [...] They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd [...] Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell, [...] And horrid sympathie; for what they saw, [...] 540 [...] They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms, [...] Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast, [...] And the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form [...] Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment, [...] As in thir crime. Thus was th' applause they meant, [...] Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame [...] Cast on themselves from thir own mouths. There stood [...] A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change, [...] His will who reigns above, to aggravate [...] Thir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that [...] 550 [...] Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve [...] Us'd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange [...] Thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining [...] For one forbidden Tree a multitude [...] Now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame; [...] Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce, [...] Though to delude them sent, could not abstain, [...] But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees [...] Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks [...] That curld Megaera: greedily they pluck'd [...] 560 [...] The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew [...] Neer that bituminous Lake where Sodom flam'd; [...] This more delusive, not the touch, but taste [...] Deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay [...] Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit [...] Chewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste [...] With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd, [...] Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft, [...] With hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws [...] With foot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell [...] 570 [...] Into the same illusion, not as Man [...] Whom they triumph'd once lapst. Thus were they plagu'd [...] And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss, [...] Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd, [...] Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo [...] This annual humbling certain number'd days, [...] To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't. [...] However some tradition they dispers'd [...] Among the Heathen of thir purchase got, [...] And Fabl'd how the Serpent, whom they calld [...] 580 [...] Ophion with Eurynome, the wide- [...] Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule [...] Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driv'n [...] And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born. [...] Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair [...] Too soon arriv'd, Sin there in power before, [...] Once actual, now in body, and to dwell [...] Habitual habitant; behind her Death [...] Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet [...] On his pale Horse: to whom Sin thus began. [...] 590 [...] Second of Satan sprung, all conquering Death, [...] What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd [...] With travail difficult, not better farr [...] Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch, [...] Unnam'd, undreaded, and thy self half starv'd? [...] Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon. [...] To mee, who with eternal Famin pine, [...] Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven, [...] There best, where most with ravin I may meet; [...] Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems [...] 600 [...] To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps. [...] To whom th' incestuous Mother thus repli'd. [...] Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, & Flours [...] Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle, [...] No homely morsels, and whatever thing [...] The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar'd, [...] Till I in Man residing through the Race, [...] His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect, [...] And season him thy last and sweetest prey. [...] This said, they both betook them several wayes, [...] 610 [...] Both to destroy, or unimmortal make [...] All kinds, and for destruction to mature [...] Sooner or later; which th' Almightie seeing, [...] From his transcendent Seat the Saints among, [...] To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice. [...] See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance [...] To waste and havoc yonder World, which I [...] So fair and good created, and had still [...] Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man [...] Let in these wastful Furies, who impute [...] 620 [...] Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell [...] And his Adherents, that with so much ease [...] I suffer them to enter and possess [...] A place so heav'nly, and conniving seem [...] To gratifie my scornful Enemies, [...] That laugh, as if transported with some fit [...] Of Passion, I to them had quitted all, [...] At random yeilded up to their misrule; [...] And know not that I call'd and drew them thither [...] My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth [...] 630 [...] Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed [...] On what was pure, till cramm'd and gorg'd, nigh burst [...] With suckt and glutted offal, at one fling [...] Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son, [...] Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave at last [...] Through Chaos hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell [...] For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes. [...] Then Heav'n and Earth renewd shall be made pure [...] To sanctitie that shall receive no staine: [...] Till then the Curse pronounc't on both precedes. [...] 640 [...] Hee ended, and the heav'nly Audience loud [...] Sung Halleluia, as the sound of Seas, [...] Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways, [...] Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works; [...] Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son, [...] Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom [...] New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise, [...] Or down from Heav'n descend. Such was thir song, [...] While the Creator calling forth by name [...] His mightie Angels gave them several charge, [...] 650 [...] As sorted best with present things. The Sun [...] Had first his precept so to move, so shine, [...] As might affect the Earth with cold and heat [...] Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call [...] Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring [...] Solstitial summers heat. To the blanc Moone [...] Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five [...] Thir planetarie motions and aspects [...] In <b>Sextile,</b> Square, and Trine, and Opposite, [...] Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne [...] 660 [...] In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt [...] Thir influence malignant when to showre, [...] Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling, [...] Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set [...] Thir corners, when with bluster to confound [...] Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle [...] With terror through the dark Aereal Hall. [...] Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse [...] The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more [...] From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd [...] 670 [...] Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun [...] Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode [...] Like distant breadth to Taurus with the Seav'n [...] Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins [...] Up to the Tropic Crab; thence down amaine [...] By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales, [...] As deep as Capricorne, to bring in change [...] Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring [...] Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours, [...] Equal in Days and Nights, except to those [...] 680 [...] Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day [...] Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun [...] To recompence his distance, in thir sight [...] Had rounded still th' Horizon, and not known [...] Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow [...] From cold Estotiland, and South as farr [...] Beneath Magellan. At that tasted Fruit [...] The Sun, as from Thyestean Banquet, turn'd [...] His course intended; else how had the World [...] Inhabited, though sinless, more then now, [...] 690 [...] Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate? [...] These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd [...] Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast, [...] Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot, [...] Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North [...] Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shoar [...] Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice [...] And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw, [...] Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud [...] And Thrascias rend the Woods and Seas upturn; [...] 700 [...] With adverse blast up-turns them from the South [...] Notus and Afer black with thundrous Clouds [...] From Serraliona; thwart of these as fierce [...] Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent Windes [...] Eurus and Zephir with thir lateral noise, [...] Sirocco, and Libecchio. Thus began [...] Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first [...] Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational, [...] Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie: [...] Beast now with Beast gan war, & Fowle with Fowle, [...] 710 [...] And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving, [...] Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe [...] Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim [...] Glar'd on him passing: these were from without [...] The growing miseries, which Adam saw [...] Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, [...] To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within, [...] And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost, [...] Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint. [...] O miserable of happie! is this the end [...] 720 [...] Of this new glorious World, and mee so late [...] The Glory of that Glory, who now becom [...] Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face [...] Of God, whom to behold was then my highth [...] Of happiness: yet well, if here would end [...] The miserie, I deserv'd it, and would beare [...] My own deservings; but this will not serve; [...] All that I eate or drink, or shall beget, [...] Is propagated curse. O voice once heard [...] Delightfully, Encrease And Multiply, [...] 730 [...] Now death to heare! for what can I encrease [...] Or multiplie, but curses on my head? [...] Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling [...] The evil on him brought by me, will curse [...] My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure, [...] For this we may thank Adam; but his thanks [...] Shall be the execration; so besides [...] Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee [...] Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound, [...] On mee as on thir natural center light [...] 740 [...] Heavie, though in thir place. O fleeting joyes [...] Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes! [...] Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay [...] To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee [...] From darkness to promote me, or here place [...] In this delicious Garden? as my Will [...] Concurd not to my being, it were but right [...] And equal to reduce me to my dust, [...] Desirous to resigne, and render back [...] All I receav'd, unable to performe [...] 750 [...] Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold [...] The good I sought not. To the loss of that, [...] Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added [...] The sense of endless woes? inexplicable [...] Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late, [...] I thus contest; then should have been refusd [...] Those terms whatever, when they were propos'd: [...] Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good, [...] Then cavil the conditions? and though God [...] Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son [...] 760 [...] Prove disobedient, and reprov'd, retort, [...] Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not: [...] Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee [...] That proud excuse? yet him not thy election, [...] But Natural necessity begot. [...] God made thee of choice his own, and of his own [...] To serve him, thy reward was of his grace, [...] Thy punishment then justly is at his Will. [...] Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair, [...] That dust I am, and shall to dust returne: [...] 770 [...] O welcom hour whenever! why delayes [...] His hand to execute what his Decree [...] Fixd on this day? why do I overlive, [...] Why am I mockt with death, and length'nd out [...] To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet [...] Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth [...] Insensible, how glad would lay me down [...] As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest [...] And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more [...] Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse [...] 780 [...] To mee and to my ofspring would torment me [...] With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt [...] Pursues me still, least all I cannot die, [...] Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man [...] Which God inspir'd, cannot together perish [...] With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave, [...] Or in some other dismal place, who knows [...] But I shall die a living Death? O thought [...] Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath [...] Of Life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life [...] 790 [...] And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither. [...] All of me then shall die: let this appease [...] The doubt, since humane reach no further knows. [...] For though the Lord of all be infinite, [...] Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so, [...] But mortal doom'd. How can he exercise [...] Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end? [...] Can he make deathless Death? that were to make [...] Strange contradiction, which to God himself [...] Impossible is held, as Argument [...] 800 [...] Of weakness, not of Power. Will he, draw out, [...] For angers sake, finite to infinite [...] In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour [...] Satisfi'd never; that were to extend [...] His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law, [...] By which all Causes else according still [...] To the reception of thir matter act, [...] Not to th' extent of thir own Spheare. But say [...] That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos'd, [...] Bereaving sense, but endless miserie [...] 810 [...] From this day onward, which I feel begun [...] Both in me, and without me, and so last [...] To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear [...] Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution [...] On my defensless head; both Death and I [...] Am found Eternal, and incorporate both, [...] Nor I on my part single, in mee all [...] Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie [...] That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able [...] To waste it all my self, and leave ye none! [...] 820 [...] So disinherited how would ye bless [...] Me now your Curse! Ah, why should all mankind [...] For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn'd, [...] If guiltless? But from mee what can proceed, [...] But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav'd, [...] Not to do onely, but to will the same [...] With me? how can they acquitted stand [...] In sight of God? Him after all Disputes [...] Forc't I absolve: all my evasions vain [...] And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still [...] 830 [...] But to my own conviction: first and last [...] On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring [...] Of all corruption, all the blame lights due; [...] So might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support [...] That burden heavier then the Earth to bear, [...] Then all the world much heavier, though divided [...] With that bad Woman? Thus what thou desir'st, [...] And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope [...] Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable [...] Beyond all past example and future, [...] 840 [...] To Satan onely like both crime and doom. [...] O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears [...] And horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which [...] I find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd! [...] Thus Adam to himself lamented loud [...] Through the still Night, now now, as ere man fell, [...] Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air [...] Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom, [...] Which to his evil Conscience represented [...] All things with double terror: On the ground [...] 850 [...] Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft [...] Curs'd his Creation, Death as oft accus'd [...] Of tardie execution, since denounc't [...] The day of his offence. Why comes not Death, [...] Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke [...] To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word, [...] Justice Divine not hast'n to be just? [...] But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine [...] Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries. [...] O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs, [...] 860 [...] With other echo farr I taught your Shades [...] To answer, and resound farr other Song. [...] Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld, [...] Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh, [...] Soft words to his fierce passion she assay'd: [...] But her with stern regard he thus repell'd. [...] Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best [...] Befits thee with him leagu'd, thy self as false [...] And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, [...] Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew [...] 870 [...] Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee [...] Henceforth; least that too heav'nly form, pretended [...] To hellish falshood, snare them. But for thee [...] I had persisted happie, had not thy pride [...] And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe, [...] Rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd [...] Not to be trusted, longing to be seen [...] Though by the Devil himself, him overweening [...] To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting [...] Fool'd and beguil'd, by him thou, I by thee, [...] 880 [...] To trust thee from my side, imagin'd wise, [...] Constant, mature, proof against all assaults, [...] And understood not all was but a shew [...] Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib [...] Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears, [...] More to the part sinister from me drawn, [...] Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie [...] To my just number found. O why did God, [...] Creator wise, that peopl'd highest Heav'n [...] With Spirits Masculine, create at last [...] 890 [...] This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect [...] Of Nature, and not fill the World at once [...] With Men as Angels without Feminine, [...] Or find some other way to generate [...] Mankind? this mischief had not then befall'n, [...] And more that shall befall, innumerable [...] Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares, [...] And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either [...] He never shall find out fit Mate, but such [...] As some misfortune brings him, or mistake, [...] 900 [...] Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain [...] Through her perverseness, but shall see her gaind [...] By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld [...] By Parents, or his happiest choice too late [...] Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound [...] To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame: [...] Which infinite calamitie shall cause [...] To humane life, and houshold peace confound. [...] He added not, and from her turn'd, but Eve [...] Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas'd not flowing, [...] 910 [...] And tresses all disorderd, at his feet [...] Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught [...] His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. [...] Forsake me not thus, Adam, witness Heav'n [...] What love sincere, and reverence in my heart [...] I beare thee, and unweeting have offended, [...] Unhappilie deceav'd; thy suppliant [...] I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, [...] Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, [...] Thy counsel in this uttermost distress, [...] 920 [...] My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee, [...] Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? [...] While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps, [...] Between us two let there be peace, both joyning, [...] As joyn'd in injuries, one enmitie [...] Against a Foe by doom express assign'd us, [...] That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not [...] Thy hatred for this miserie befall'n, [...] On me already lost, mee then thy self [...] More miserable; both have sin'd, but thou [...] 930 [...] Against God onely, I against God and thee, [...] And to the place of judgement will return, [...] There with my cries importune Heaven, that all [...] The sentence from thy head remov'd may light [...] On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe, [...] Mee mee onely just object of his ire. [...] She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight, [...] Immoveable till peace obtain'd from fault [...] Acknowledg'd and deplor'd, in Adam wraught [...] Commiseration; soon his heart relented [...] 940 [...] Towards her, his life so late and sole delight, [...] Now at his feet submissive in distress, [...] Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking, [...] His counsel whom she had displeas'd, his aide; [...] As one disarm'd, his anger all he lost, [...] And thus with peaceful words uprais'd her soon. [...] Unwarie, and too desirous, as before, [...] So now of what thou knowst not, who desir'st [...] The punishment all on thy self; alas, [...] Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine [...] 950 [...] His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part, [...] And my displeasure bearst so ill. If Prayers [...] Could alter high Decrees, I to that place [...] Would speed before thee, and be louder heard, [...] That on my head all might be visited, [...] Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv'n, [...] To me committed and by me expos'd. [...] But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame [...] Each other, blam'd enough elsewhere, but strive [...] In offices of Love, how we may light'n [...] 960 [...] Each others burden in our share of woe; [...] Since this days Death denounc't, if ought I see, [...] Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac't evill, [...] A long days dying to augment our paine, [...] And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv'd. [...] To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, repli'd. [...] Adam, by sad experiment I know [...] How little weight my words with thee can finde, [...] Found so erroneous, thence by just event [...] Found so unfortunate; nevertheless, [...] 970 [...] Restor'd by thee, vile as I am, to place [...] Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine [...] Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart, [...] Living or dying from thee I will not hide [...] What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n, [...] Tending to som relief of our extremes, [...] Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, [...] As in our evils, and of easier choice. [...] If care of our descent perplex us most, [...] Which must be born to certain woe, devourd [...] 980 [...] By Death at last, and miserable it is [...] To be to others cause of misery, [...] Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring [...] Into this cursed World a woful Race, [...] That after wretched Life must be at last [...] Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power [...] It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent [...] The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot. [...] Childless thou art, Childless remaine: [...] So Death shall be deceav'd his glut, and with us two [...] 990 [...] Be forc'd to satisfie his Rav'nous Maw. [...] But if thou judge it hard and difficult, [...] Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain [...] From Loves due Rites, Nuptial embraces sweet, [...] And with desire to languish without hope, [...] Before the present object languishing [...] With like desire, which would be miserie [...] And torment less then none of what we dread, [...] Then both our selves and Seed at once to free [...] From what we fear for both, let us make short, [...] 1000 [...] Let us seek Death, or hee not found, supply [...] With our own hands his Office on our selves; [...] Why stand we longer shivering under feares, [...] That shew no end but Death, and have the power, [...] Of many wayes to die the shortest choosing, [...] Destruction with destruction to destroy. [...] She ended heer, or vehement despaire [...] Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts [...] Had entertaind, as di'd her Cheeks with pale. [...] But Adam with such counsel nothing sway'd, [...] 1010 [...] To better hopes his more attentive minde [...] Labouring had rais'd, and thus to Eve repli'd. [...] Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems [...] To argue in thee somthing more sublime [...] And excellent then what thy minde contemnes; [...] But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes [...] That excellence thought in thee, and implies, [...] Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret [...] For loss of life and pleasure overlov'd. [...] Or if thou covet death, as utmost end [...] 1020 [...] Of miserie, so thinking to evade [...] The penaltie pronounc't, doubt not but God [...] Hath wiselier arm'd his vengeful ire then so [...] To be forestall'd; much more I fear least Death [...] So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine [...] We are by doom to pay; rather such acts [...] Of contumacie will provoke the highest [...] To make death in us live: Then let us seek [...] Som safer resolution, which methinks [...] I have in view, calling to minde with heed [...] 1030 [...] Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise [...] The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless [...] Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe [...] Satan, who in the Serpent hath contriv'd [...] Against us this deceit: to crush his head [...] Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost [...] By death brought on our selves, or childless days [...] Resolv'd, as thou proposest; so our Foe [...] Shall scape his punishment ordain'd, and wee [...] Instead shall double ours upon our heads.

5000|$|Jupiter is in a {{feminine}} sign, while the Sun and Mars {{are both in}} masculine signs. Jupiter is also in a mutable water sign, while the Sun is in a cardinal air sign and Mars in a fixed fire sign. Jupiter shares neither duality, element, nor mode with the two planets that aspect it in quincunx. This complete lack of commonality of Jupiter with the two <b>sextile</b> planets illustrates how the yod triggers an irritating situation that can be overcome only through adaptation and discovering new paths. If {{there is no other}} aspect outlet for Jupiter (as would be reflected in a trine or <b>sextile</b> angle to another planet), a transiting planet in opposition to Jupiter and conjunct the midpoint of the <b>sextile</b> planets can trigger major life events which are difficult to handle and take great creativity to overcome. This is why the yod is often called the [...] "Finger of God", for it takes great initiative and fortitude to overcome the limitations created by the yod, but great rewards can result if the native does the necessary work.|$|E

5000|$|Yod {{is a rare}} astrological aspect that {{involves}} any three planets or points in the horoscope that form an isosceles triangle. This phenomenon occurs when two planets are <b>sextile</b> (60° aspect) to each other, and both are then quincunx (150° aspect) to a third. [...] The Yod is formed when the two planets make a <b>sextile</b> aspect and the third planet is opposite their mid-point. That third planet must make angles of 150 degrees with the other two. If you drew lines on the chart connecting the planets, you would get a Y-shaped formation that seems to point to {{one part of the}} horoscope.|$|E

50|$|Other {{proposals}} are more creative or aesthetic, for example, Edna Kramer in her 1951 book The Main Stream of Mathematics used a six-pointed asterisk (<b>sextile)</b> ⚹ for ten and a hash (or octothorpe) # for eleven. The symbols were chosen {{because they are}} available in typewriters and already present in telephone dials.

50|$|A Yod is a {{name for}} an aspect which forms a {{triangle}} shape. The two <b>sextile</b> (60° apart) planets means that they are harmonious to each other but weak where as the quincunx (150° apart) planet is incompatible to that pairing as it shares neither gender (masculine/assertive or feminine/receptive), element (fire, water, air, or earth), or modality (cardinal, fixed, or mutable). This aspect activates a powerful conduit of energy, and/or a deeply felt block, {{in the direction of}} the third, separated planet.|$|E
5000|$|Leap {{years in}} the {{calendar}} are a point of great dispute, due to the contradicting statements in the establishing decree stating: Each year begins at midnight, with the day on which the true autumnal equinox falls for the Paris Observatory. and: The four-year period, after which {{the addition of a}} day is usually necessary, is called the Franciade in memory of the revolution which, after four years of effort, led France to republican government. The fourth year of the Franciade is called <b>Sextile.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A square (abrv. SQr or Squ) is {{an angle}} of 90° (1/4 of the 360° ecliptic, or 1/2 of an {{opposition}} 180°). An orb of somewhere between 5° and 10° is usually allowed. As with the trine and the <b>sextile,</b> in the square, {{it is usually}} the outer or superior planet that has an effect on the inner or inferior one. Basically, the square's energy {{is similar to that of}} a trine but it is intensified to such an extent that the energy is said to be stressful.|$|E
50|$|In medieval astrology, certain aspects, like certain planets, were {{considered}} to be either favorable (benefic) or unfavorable (malefic). Modern usage places less emphasis on these fatalistic distinctions. The more modern (but still unscientific) approach to astrological aspects is exemplified by research on astrological harmonics, of which John Addey was a major proponent, and which Johannes Kepler earlier advocated in his book Harmonice Mundi in 1619. But even in modern times, the aspects are divided into hard aspects or easy aspects. Major hard aspects being the square and opposition and the easy aspects as trine and <b>sextile.</b> The conjunction can be in either category depending on the planets that are connected.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} major aspects {{are sometimes}} called Ptolemaic aspects {{since they were}} defined and used by Ptolemy in the 1st Century, AD. These aspects are the conjunction (0°), <b>sextile</b> (60°), square (90°), trine (120°), and opposition (180°). It {{is important to note}} that different astrologers and separate astrological systems/traditional utilize differing orbs (the degree of separation between exactitude) when calculating and using the aspects, though almost all use a larger orb for a conjunction when compared to the other aspects. The major aspects are those that can be used to divide 360 evenly and are divisible by 10 (with the exception of the semi-sextile).|$|E
50|$|The {{midpoint}} of the <b>sextile</b> is a very sensitive point in the chart, as transiting planets, when conjunct with this midpoint, will then be {{in opposition to the}} quincunxed planet. This situation is said to trigger major events, thus revealing the true power of the Yod. Multiple sextiles and trines involving Yod planets can be extremely beneficial and thus spread the energy of this aspect in one side of the chart or produce a focal point for intense energies {{on the other side of}} the chart. Hence, the yod is the most difficult natal chart aspect to interpret and requires a great aptitude in astrological interpretation to divine accurately.|$|E
5000|$|If the two {{planets are}} not in astrological aspect to one other (that is, the signs {{in which they are}} placed {{are not in}} <b>sextile,</b> trine, square or {{opposition}} angles to one another, the condition of mutual reception will be much less forceful, since there is no connection between the two planets in which this mutuality can be effected. Furthermore, if the aspect between the two signs is one of opposition, the planets will both be opposite their signs of rulership, which is the definition of being in detriment, and hence both will be too weak to be of much help to the other.|$|E
50|$|Mutual {{reception}} is {{not limited}} to exchange of the signs of dignity of rulership. Ancient and medieval astrologers gave equal force to mutuality obtained by planets being in each other's signs of exaltation—for example, Jupiter in Taurus in a chart where the Moon is in Cancer. Jupiter is exalted in the sign of Cancer; Moon is exalted in the sign of Taurus. This is a very powerful mutual reception, not only because Taurus and Cancer are in a <b>sextile</b> aspect to one another, but also because the Moon is also in its own house in Cancer. This placement would tend to give a notably generous and probably religious individual, with a good deal of luck and talent.|$|E
