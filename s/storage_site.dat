5|$|During World War II, Hungarian {{mathematician}} Pál Turán {{was forced}} {{to work in a}} brick factory, pushing wagon loads of bricks from kilns to storage sites. The factory had tracks from each kiln to each <b>storage</b> <b>site,</b> and the wagons were harder to push at the points where tracks crossed each other. Turán was inspired by this situation to ask how the factory might be redesigned to minimize the number of crossings between these tracks.|$|E

30|$|An {{important}} decision for policy makers is selecting strategic petroleum reserve sites. However, policy makers may not choose {{the most suitable}} and efficient locations for strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) due to the complexity {{in the choice of}} sites. This paper proposes a multi-objective programming model to determine the optimal locations for China’s SPR <b>storage</b> <b>sites.</b> This model considers not only the minimum response time but also the minimum transportation cost based on a series of reasonable assumptions and constraint conditions. The factors influencing SPR sites are identified to determine potential demand points and candidate <b>storage</b> <b>sites.</b> Estimation and suggestions are made for the selection of China’s future SPR <b>storage</b> <b>sites</b> {{based on the results of}} this model. When the number of petroleum <b>storage</b> <b>sites</b> is less than or equals 25 and the maximum capacity of <b>storage</b> <b>sites</b> is restricted to 10 million tonnes, the model’s result best fit for the current layout scheme selected thirteen <b>storage</b> <b>sites</b> in four scenarios. Considering the current status of SPR in China, Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, Daqing and Zhanjiang, Chengdu, Xi’an, and Yueyang are suggested to be the candidate locations for the third phase of the construction plan. The locations of petroleum <b>storage</b> <b>sites</b> suggested in this work could be used as a reference for decision makers.|$|R

5|$|In May 2007, Npower {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} new £2billion clean coal power station on the site. The proposed station would have generated electricity using three 800MW advanced supercritical steam, high-efficiency coal-fired units, giving the station a total generation capacity of 2,400MW. This was one of two new coal-fired stations proposed by Npower in the UK. The site was chosen because of its readily available proximity to the national grid, its rail and port links, and its position next to the North Sea, which is useful for both cooling water, and as a potential CO2 <b>storage</b> <b>site,</b> where CO2 could be piped to oil and gas wells, and saline aquifers.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{there was}} an {{modernization}} of the upstream logistics. A breakthrough occurred when it was established that lumber {{did not have to}} be air-dried for two years before being made to pulp, freeing up a <b>storage</b> <b>site</b> at Veden which had stored up to one million logs. Trucks were introduced in transport and hundreds of kilometers (hundreds of miles) of lumber roads were built to ease extraction. For instance they were used to truck lumber from Store Le to Øymarkasjøen, thus closing the Otteeid Canal. Increased lumber demand was covered through procurement from Värmland and the Glomma watershed. Log driving was eliminated on tributaries and limited to the main course of Haldenvassdraget.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear power arguably {{began in}} Illinois with the Chicago Pile-1, the world's first {{artificial}} self-sustaining nuclear chain {{reaction in the}} world's first nuclear reactor, built on the University of Chicago campus. There are six operating nuclear power plants in Illinois: Braidwood; Byron; Clinton; Dresden; LaSalle; and Quad Cities. With {{the exception of the}} single-unit Clinton plant, each of these facilities has two reactors. Three reactors have been permanently shut down and are in various stages of decommissioning: Dresden-1 and Zion-1 and 2. Illinois ranked first in the nation in 2010 in both nuclear capacity and nuclear generation. Generation from its nuclear power plants accounted for 12 percent of the Nation's total. In 2007, 48% of Illinois's electricity was generated using nuclear power. The Morris Operation is the only de facto high-level radioactive waste <b>storage</b> <b>site</b> in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The ongoing {{controversy}} over {{high-level radioactive waste}} disposal is a major constraint on the nuclear power’s global expansion. Most scientists agree that the main proposed long-term solution is deep geological burial, either in a mine or a deep borehole. However, almost six decades after commercial nuclear energy began, no government has succeeded in opening such a repository for civilian high-level nuclear waste, although Finland is in the advanced stage {{of the construction of}} such facility, the Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository. Reprocessing or recycling spent nuclear fuel options already available or under active development still generate waste and so are not a total solution, but can reduce the sheer quantity of waste, and there are many such active programs worldwide. Deep geological burial remains the only responsible way to deal with high-level nuclear waste. The Morris Operation is currently the only de facto high-level radioactive waste <b>storage</b> <b>site</b> in the United States.|$|E
40|$|Majority of {{geologic}} CO 2 <b>storage</b> <b>sites</b> for currently operated large-scale integrated {{carbon capture}} and storage projects (LSIPs) in operation {{around the world}} are depleted oil fields that have been undergone significant depletion and re-pressurization prior to injection of captured CO 2. A better understanding of any of the implications associated with past depletion and re-pressurization histories to “out of injection zone” migration of injected CO 2 can help in making monitoring strategies significantly more effective. Being the geologic CO 2 <b>storage</b> demonstration <b>sites</b> for two most active LSIPs in the US, the West Hastings and the Bell Creek Oil Fields are the main focus of present study. The monitoring technologies that have been used/deployed/tested at both the normally pressured West Hastings and the subnormally pressured Bell Creek <b>storage</b> <b>sites</b> appear to adequately address any of the potential “out of zone migration” of injected CO 2 at these sites. It would {{be interesting to see if}} any of the collected monitoring data at the West Hastings and the Bell Creek <b>storage</b> <b>sites</b> could also be used in future to better understand the viability of initially subnormally pressured and subsequently depleted and re-pressurized oil fields as secure geologic CO 2 <b>storage</b> <b>sites</b> with relatively large storage CO 2 capacities compared to the depleted and re-pressurized oil fields that were initially discovered as normally pressured...|$|R

25|$|The Draft Environmental Impact Study (DEIS) for {{the project}} was issued in June 2017. Four {{alternatives}} for alignments under the Hudson River and the Palisades. Option 1 would have the new tunnels run close to the existing tunnels with a ventilation site near the Lincoln Tunnel Helix. This option would have required a construction staging site within the Lincoln Tunnel Helix, thus displacing New Jersey Transit's Weehawken bus <b>storage</b> <b>site,</b> which would {{have a negative impact}} on the operation of buses to the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Option 2 would have the new tunnels run further south than the first option, with a shaft site north of 19th Street near JFK Boulevard East. This option would require the acquisition and demolition of an existing multi-story office building to build the shaft site. The third option would be further south with a shaft site south of 19th Street. This option would preclude the development of a portion of a planned residential development under construction at 800 Harbor Boulevard. The fourth option would be further south with a shaft site south of 18th Street–following the same horizontal alignment identified in the ARC FEIS. Alignment Option 4 was chosen for the build alternative even though it would have a slightly longer tunnel than in the other alternatives. Because of the additional length, there would be additional tunneling costs for this option. However, the first three options have greater pre-construction risks, meaning that if construction was delayed the cost difference would be minimized. In addition, Option 4 does not have the issues that the first three options have.|$|E
