40|$|Global {{growth of}} nuclear energy in the 21 st century is {{creating}} new challenges to limit the spread of <b>nuclear</b> <b>technology</b> without hindering adoption in countries now considering nuclear power. Independent nuclear states desire autonomy over energy choices and seek energy independence. However, this independence comes with high costs for development of new indigenous fuel cycle capabilities. Nuclear supplier states and expert groups have proposed fuel supply assurance mechanisms such as fuel take-back services, international enrichment services and fuel banks in exchange for recipient state concessions {{on the development of}} <b>sensitive</b> <b>technologies.</b> <b>Nuclear</b> states are slow to accept any concessions to their rights under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. To date, decisions not to develop indigenous fuel cycle capabilities have been driven primarily by economics. However, additional incentives may be required to offset a nuclear state’s perceived loss of energy independence. This paper proposes alternative economic development incentives that could help countries decide to forgo development of <b>sensitive</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>technologies.</b> The incentives are created through a nuclear-centered industrial complex with “symbiotic” links to indigenous economic opportunities. This paper also describes a practical tool called the “Nuclear Materials Exchange” for identifying these opportunities...|$|R

Since {{the collapse of the}} Soviet Union, <b>sensitive</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>technologies</b> and materials have become increasingly available. Globalization and the inadequate enforcement of treaties and export controls have allowed the proliferation of nuclear weapons materials.

" As political scientist Graham Allison notes, this could be achieved with either 1, 334 attacks similar in magnitude to those of 9 / 11, or one nuclear bomb. Building a nuclear program is an arduous task that requires tacit knowledge, the recruitment of nuclear scientists, engineers, and machinists, and the resources and time to obtain nuclear materials and components.

40|$|AbstractThe {{growing number}} of {{countries}} wishing to use nuclear energy, and the expansion in the geography of NPPs entails the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation, given that political leaders in some countries may want to purchase or develop <b>sensitive</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>technologies.</b> A certain risk of proliferation through <b>nuclear</b> power <b>technologies</b> and materials cannot be excluded altogether. In the nuclear fuel cycle there are large inventories of nuclear materials, including fissile materials, (many hundreds and thousands of tons). The problem of spent nuclear fuel with plutonium in it, especially for novice countries and countries with small nuclear power program, also {{increases the risk of}} proliferation, including the growing risk of actions on the part of subnational or terrorist organizations because of the proliferation of <b>nuclear</b> <b>technologies</b> and materials as respective protection measures are insufficient in these countries. In the event of thermal reactors, uranium enrichment is indispensable to production of fuel. Long-term storage of SNF from thermal reactors in an open fuel cycle, which is a common practice nowadays, entails an increased risk of proliferation due to the weakening of the radiation barrier over time and the potentiality of unauthorized removal of fuel by the proliferator state and its theft by criminals and terrorists. Fast-neutron reactors started up and operating on plutonium fuel do not require uranium enrichment. There is no long-term storage of SNF in the closed fuel cycles of fast reactors. Gradual replacement of thermal reactors by fast reactors, due to natural uranium being in short supply, creates prerequisites for phasing out uranium enrichment. However, countries having small nuclear power programs and, therefore, a limited number of nuclear units will use thermal reactors still for a long time, which will require uranium enrichment. Creation of nuclear weapons based on energy-grade plutonium using a simpler “gun-type” design is practically impossible because of a high neutron background inherent in this kind of plutonium. However, this does not exclude the potentiality of terrorist attempts to fabricate a primitive nuclear explosive device. Both sensitive technologies (uranium enrichment and SNF processing with separation of plutonium) will be used to start up fast reactors on uranium fuel with the subsequent transition to plutonium fuel. In this case, plutonium with a small content of higher isotopes will be bred not only in the blanket, but also in the reactor core in much greater quantities. The paper considers various technological and institutional approaches to solving the problem of fast reactor blankets in terms of ensuring a strong proliferation resistance...|$|R
