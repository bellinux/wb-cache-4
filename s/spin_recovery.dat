25|$|One {{critical}} area of design was the {{positioning of the}} vertical stabilizer (fin). The CL-41 was intended to demonstrate <b>spin</b> <b>recovery.</b> If the fin is too far forward, a spin cannot be initiated, {{but if it is}} too far aft, recovery becomes impossible.

The original Tutor wind-tunnel model had a cruciform tail, which was revised to the T-tail design by removing the portion above the horizontal stabilizer.|$|E
25|$|The Tomahawk was Piper's {{attempt at}} {{creating}} an affordable two-place trainer. Before designing the aircraft, Piper widely surveyed flight instructors for their {{input into the}} design. Instructors requested a more spinnable aircraft for training purposes, since other two-place trainers such as the Cessna 150 and 152 were designed to spontaneously fly out of a spin. The Tomahawk's NASA GA(W)-1 Whitcomb airfoil addresses this requirement by making specific pilot input necessary in recovering from spins, thus allowing pilots to develop proficiency in dealing with <b>spin</b> <b>recovery.</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the <b>spin</b> and <b>recovery</b> characteristics of a scale model of the Grumman XF 9 F- 2 airplane has been conducted in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel. The effects of control settings and movements on the erect and inverted <b>spin</b> and <b>recovery</b> characteristics of the model in the flight loading were determined. The investigation also included spin-recovery-parachute, pilot-escape, and rudder-pedal-. force tests. The recovery characteristics of the model were satisfactory for all configurations tested.

25|$|In {{the course}} of further testing, {{it was found that}} the Hurricane had poor <b>spin</b> <b>recovery</b> characteristics, in which all rudder {{authority}} could be lost due to shielding of the rudder. Hawker's response to the issue was to request that spinning tests be waived, but the Air Ministry refused the request; the situation was resolved by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), who established that the aerodynamic problem had been caused by a breakdown of the airflow over the lower fuselage, and could be cured by the addition of a small ventral fairing and extension of the bottom of the rudder. This discovery had come too late for the changes to be incorporated in the first production aircraft, but were introduced upon the 61st built and all subsequent aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Deliveries of {{production}} P-63As began in October 1943. The USAAF concluded the Kingcobra was {{inferior to the}} Mustang, and declined to order larger quantities. American allies, particularly the Soviet Union, had a great need for fighter aircraft, however, and the Soviets were already the largest users of the Airacobra. Therefore, the Kingcobra was ordered into production to be delivered under Lend-Lease. In February 1944, the Soviet government sent a highly experienced test pilot, Andrey G. Kochetkov, and an aviation engineer, Fyodor P. Suprun, to the Bell factories {{to participate in the}} development of the first production variant, the P-63A. Initially ignored by Bell engineers, Kochetkov's expert testing of the machine's spin characteristics (which led to airframe buckling) eventually led to a significant Soviet role in the development. After flat <b>spin</b> <b>recovery</b> proved impossible, and upon Kochetkov's making a final recommendation that pilots should bail out upon entering such a spin, he received a commendation from the Irving Parachute Company. The Kingcobraâ€™s maximum aft CG was moved forward to facilitate recovery from spins.|$|E

The spoilers provided good roll control at all speeds and the distinctive four-petal airbrakes (which also opened slightly when the afterburner was engaged to allow for the larger flow of exhaust gases) were highly effective even at supersonic speeds.

500|$|The B-37, {{given the}} service name [...] "Firebrand" [...] on 11 July 1941, was a low-winged, {{all-metal}} monoplane.

The radiators for the neatly cowled Sabre engine were housed in wing-root extensions. The large wing consisted of a two-spar centre section with manually folded outer panels (with five degrees of dihedral) to allow more compact storage in the hangar decks of aircraft carriers. To increase lift and reduce landing speed the wing was fitted with large, hydraulically powered Fairey-Youngman flaps that extended {{to the edges of}} the Frise ailerons. The fixed armament of four [...] Hispano autocannon was fitted in the outer wing panels with 200 rounds per gun. The fin and rudder were positioned forward of the elevator to ensure <b>spin</b> <b>recovery</b> and that the rudder would retain its effectiveness. The mainwheels of the conventional landing gear were mounted at the ends of the centre wing section and retracted inwards. The Firebrand was unusual in {{the fact that there was}} an airspeed gauge mounted outside of the cockpit so that during landing the pilot would not have to look down into the cockpit to take instrument readings, foreshadowing the modern heads-up display.|$|E

2500|$|The B.E.2c {{was a major}} redesign, {{the result}} of {{research}} by E.T. Busk intended to provide an inherently stable aeroplane.

Relatively large orders were placed for the new version, with deliveries of production aircraft starting in December 1914. During 1915 this model replaced the early B.E.2s in the squadrons in France. The B.E.2c used the same fuselage as the B.E.2b, but was otherwise really a new type, being fitted with new wings of different plan form, increased dihedral, and forward stagger, ailerons replacing the wing warping of the earlier models.

Results obtained to date are presented herein. Test results indicate {{that it may be}} difficult to obtain an erect or inverted spin on the airplane, but, if a spin is obtained, the spin will be very oscillatory and recovery from the developed erect spin by rudder reversal may not be possible.

Based on limited preliminary tests made in this investigation to make the model recover satisfactorily, it appears that canards near the nose of the airplane or differentially operated horizontal tails may be utilized to provide rapid recoveries. The parachute test results indicate that an 11 -foot-diameter (laid-out-flat) parachute with a drag coefficient of 0. 650 (based on the laid- out-flat diameter) and with a towline length equal to the wing span is the minimum-size parachute required to satisfactorily terminate an erect or inverted spin in an emergency...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the <b>spin</b> and <b>recovery</b> characteristics of a 0. 057 -scale model of the Chance Vought XF 7 U- 1 airplane has been conducted in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel.

The investigation also included wing-tip spin-recovery-parachute tests, pilot-escape tests, and rudder-control-force tests. The investigation indicated that the <b>spin</b> and <b>recovery</b> characteristics of the airplane will be satisfactory for all conditions. It was found that a single 4. 24 -foot (full-scale) parachute when opened alone from the outboard wing tip or two 8. 77 -foot (full-scale) parachutes when opened simultaneously, one from each wing tip, would effect satisfactory emergency recoveries (the drag coefficients of the parachutes, based on the surface area of the parachute, were 0. 83 and 0. 70 for the 4. 24 - and 8. 77 -foot parachutes, respectively). The towline length in both cases was 25 feet (full scale).
