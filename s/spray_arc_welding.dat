40|$|An ongoing {{continuous}} process of automatization {{of the production}} lines is used in industry to reduce production costs. Automatization of quality control {{should be seen as}} part of a cost reduction process, as well as of quality control of the welding. Mostly the time-consuming and expensive checking procedure of the weld joint is carried out off-line by an experienced welding operator. The need for automatic quality control is thus great in order to achieve higher cost efficiency. The present thesis focus on the weld quality of pulsed, short-circuiting and spray Gas Metal Arc welding. The purpose is to design algorithms to detect defects on-line and automatically during a robotic welding pass using the measured weld voltage and current. Experiments with different specimens are performed in order to cause defects in weld joints and introduce symptoms in the measured signals. The defects produced in the weld joint are found to be of two main kinds. In pulsed welding, burn-through occurs. In spray arc and short-circuiting welding, the size of the weld was reduced. The two types of defects and their relation to the measured welding voltage and current are discussed. The environment around the measurements is highly disturbed by electrical noise. Several measurement techniques is used accordingly in order to prevent interference of the measurements. To obtain a reliable detection, features which are sensitive to changes in the weld process must be extracted from the measured signals. Features which are suggested in other works of this field, and features which are obtained through observation of the measured signals from the experiments of the present thesis are investigated. The investigation shows that the mean and variance of the weld voltage and current yield promising results when welding in short-circuiting and spray mode due to the robustness of the extracted features. When welding in pulsed mode, the prediction error from an autoregressive model with extra input is used as a feature. The extracted features are fed into a detection algorithm to further enhance the signal to noise ratio of the resulting test quantity. The filtering of the features is then compared to a threshold. Six statistical detection algorithms for weld quality have been designed and tested on measured data. Two methods have been applied to pulsed GMA welding, one for short-circuiting welding and three for the <b>spray</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding.</b> The results obtained from the experiments shows {{that it is possible to}} detect changes in the weld quality both automaticall...|$|E
50|$|In gas {{tungsten}} <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (GTAW), inert gases {{are used to}} shield the tungsten from contamination. It also shields the fluid metal (created from the arc) from the reactive gases in air which can cause porosity in the solidified weld puddle. Inert gases are also used in gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (GMAW) for welding non-ferrous metals. Some gases which are not usually considered inert but which behave like inert gases in all the circumstances likely to be encountered in some use can often {{be used as a}} substitute for an inert gas. This is useful when an appropriate pseudo-inert gas can be found which is inexpensive and common. For example, carbon dioxide is sometimes used in gas mixtures for GMAW because it is not reactive to the weld pool created by <b>arc</b> <b>welding.</b> But it is reactive to the arc. The more carbon dioxide that is added to the inert gas, such as argon, will increase your penetration. The amount of carbon dioxide is often determined by what kind of transfer you will be using in GMAW. The most common is <b>spray</b> <b>arc</b> transfer, and the most commonly used gas mixture for <b>spray</b> <b>arc</b> transfer is 90% argon and 10% carbon dioxide.

These cracks were detected in structural steel exhibiting a yield strength level of up to 960 MPa and are neither dependent on the used weld power source nor {{a consequence of the}} modified <b>spray</b> <b>arc</b> process itself. The metallographic and fractographic investigations of the rather exceptional fracture surface lead to the classification of the microcracks as hot cracks. The effects of certain welding parameters on the crack probability are clarified using a statistical design of experiment.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of work to date concerned with obstacle avoidance for manipulators has dealt with task descriptions in the form ofpick-and-place movements. The added flexibility in motion control for manipulators possessing redundant degrees offreedom permits the consideration of obstacle avoidance {{in the context of}} a specified end-effector trajectory as the task description. Such a task definition is a more accurate model for such tasks as <b>spray</b> painting or <b>arc</b> <b>welding.</b> The approach presented here is to determine the required joint angle rates for the manipulator under the constraints of multiple goals, the primary goal described by the specified end-effector trajectory and secondary goals describing the obstacle avoidance criteria. The decomposition of the solution into a particular and a homogeneous component effectively illustrates the priority of the multiple goals that is exact end-effector control with redundant degrees of freedom maximizing the distance to obstacles. An efficient numerical implementation of the technique permits sufficiently fast cycle times to deal with dynamic environments. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For arcs at {{atmospheric}} pressure which have cathodes that are thermionic emitters, {{it is possible}} to calculate the major properties of the arc and the electrodes as a function of current, by accounting for electrode shape and the heat transfer processes occurring at the surface of the electrodes. Such processes occur due to eleclron and ion emission and absorption and also from radiation emission and absorption. Electrical resistance of the plasma near the electrodes is calculated either by laking account of ambipolar diffusion or simply using the local plasma value, with mesh sizes sufficiently large to account for ambipolar diffusion. Derived temperature profiles are in fair agreement with experiment. Results of electrode temperatures and arc melting effects, including such phenomena as the transition from globular to <b>spray</b> modes in <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> are also in good agreement with experiment. Prediction of properties for non-thermionic cathodes still constitute a major problem. Approximate calculations indicate that electrons at the surface of the non-thermionic cathodes may be produced by photo ionisation of neutral atoms rather than by field emission. 1...|$|R
30|$|Arc {{behaviour}} is {{a significant}} factor in all <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> processes. Understanding of arc types and their inherent properties can help enhance weld prediction and weld quality and reduce welding cost and production cycle time. Advanced welding processes utilize real-time control and prediction, increasing the need for detailed knowledge of arc characteristics and arc applications. This paper analyses the types of <b>welding</b> <b>arcs</b> used in the welding industry, explains corresponding features and characteristics, provides guidance for suitable applications, and presents arc type comparisons, benefits, and weaknesses. The study is based on a review of the literature, and it provides a comprehensive overview of arc phenomena. The results of this work show that in many applications, greater benefit accrues from <b>spray</b> and pulsed <b>arcs</b> than short and globular arc modes. Controlled short arc, heavy deposition rate <b>arc,</b> and controlled <b>spray</b> <b>arc</b> are enhanced arc processes offering significant improvements in efficiency and usability. This review can assist companies in making appropriate choices of <b>arc</b> and <b>welding</b> process for different materials and applications.

This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> flux cored <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> and submerged <b>arc</b> <b>welding.</b> In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current.
