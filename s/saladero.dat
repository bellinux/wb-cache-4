These were built entirely of cows' skulls, seven, eight, or nine deep, placed evenly like stones, the horns projecting. Hundreds of thousands of skulls had been thus used, and some of the old, very long walls, crowned with green grass and with creepers and wild flowers growing from the cavities in the bones, had a strangely picturesque but somewhat uncanny appearance.

6000|$|In those days, {{and indeed}} {{down to the}} seventies of last century, {{the south side of}} the capital was the site of the famous <b>Saladero,</b> or killing-grounds, where the fat cattle, horses and sheep brought in from all over the country were {{slaughtered}} every day, some to supply the town with beef and mutton and to make charque, or sun-dried beef, for exportation to Brazil, where it was used to feed the slaves, but the greater number of the animals, including all the horses, were killed solely for their hides and tallow. The grounds covered a space of three or four square miles, where there were cattle enclosures made of upright posts placed close together, and some low buildings scattered about To this spot were driven endless flocks of sheep, half or wholly wild horses and dangerous-looking, long-horned cattle in herds of a hundred or so to a thousand, each moving in its cloud of dust, with noise of bellowings and bleatings and furious shouting of the drovers as they galloped up and down, urging the doomed animals on. When the beasts arrived in too great numbers to be dealt with in the buildings, you could see hundreds of cattle being killed in the open all over the grounds in the old barbarous way the gauchos use, every animal being first lassoed, then hamstrung, then its throat cut --a hideous and horrible spectacle, with a suitable accompaniment of sounds in the wild shouts of the slaughterers and the awful bellowings of the tortured beasts. Just where the animal was knocked down and killed, it was stripped of its hide and the carcass cut up, a portion of the flesh and the fat being removed and all the rest left on the ground to be devoured by the pariah dogs, the carrion hawks, and a multitude of screaming black-headed gulls always in attendance. The blood so abundantly shed from day to day, mixing with the dust, had formed a crust half a foot thick all over the open space: let the reader try to imagine the smell of this crust and of tons of offal and flesh and bones lying everywhere in heaps. But no, it cannot be imagined. The most dreadful scenes, the worst in Dante's Inferno, for example, can be visualized by the inner eye; and sounds, too, are conveyed to us in a description so that they can be heard mentally; but it is not so with smells. The reader can only take my word for it that this smell was probably the worst ever known on the earth, unless he accepts as true the story of Tobit and the [...] "fishy fumes" [...] by means of which that ancient hero defended himself in his retreat from the pursuing devil.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the main}} causes of the spread of this disease were the {{insufficient}} supply of drinking water, pollution of ground water by human waste, the warm and humid climate in summer, the overcrowding suffered by the black people and, since 1871, the overcrowding of the European immigrants who entered the country incessantly and without sanitary measures. Also, the <b>saladeros</b> (manufacturing establishments for producing salted and dried meat) polluted the Matanza River (south of the city limits), and the infected ditches full of debris which ran through the city encouraged {{the spread of the}} mosquito Aedes aegypti, which was responsible of transmitting Yellow Fever.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the {{material}} components of ceramic artifacts. Compositional analysis was performed on Saladoid series ceramics primarily from Puerto Rico, but also from St. Croix, St. Martin, Antigua, Trinidad, and Venezuela. Samples from the sites of Hacienda Grande (Loisa, P. R.), Punta Candelero (Humacao, P. R.), Maisabel (Vega Baja, P. R.), Sorce/La Hueca (Vieques, P. R.), Salt River and Richmond (St. Croix), Hope Estate (St. Martin), Indian Creek (Antigua) and <b>Saladero</b> (Venezuela). It has been postulated by Irving Rouse (1948) and other Caribbean archaeologists, that the people responsible for these sites had come from mainland South America. The movement of the population is traced through the Antilles by the trail of stylistically homogeneous pottery left behind over a time period of approximately five hundred years. ^ Recent excavations at Hope Estate, St. Martin (Haviser, 1989), Sorce/La Hueca, Vieques, P. R. (Baik and Narganes, 1986), and Punta Candelero, Humacao, P. R. (Rodriguez, 1989) have produced a variation of this distinctive artifact assemblage. Some archaeologists (Baik, 1983; Haviser, 1989; and Narganes, 1989) now question whether the mainlanders were a culturally homogeneous group following a single route to their northern frontier in what is now Santo Domingo and Haiti (see Rouse, 1987). Baik and Narganes have proposed that a separate cultural group arrived in the Vieques Channel area (the eastern end of Puerto Rico and outlying islands to Culebra) from the coast of Venezuela following a due north route circumventing the rest of the Antilles. Haviser has linked this group to his findings at the Hope Estate site in St. Martin (1989). The components of these sites that possess the distinctive ceramic assemblage referred to by Rouse as a possible Huecan subseries of the Saladoid series of styles, and by Baik and Narganes as Huecoid, provide the variation, and hence the controversy, on which my research centers. The results of the compositional analysis provide evidence that the La Hueca-style pottery should be classified within the Cedrosan Saladoid series of styles, rather than a distinct series (Huecoid). ...|$|E
