40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to explore {{some of the}} reasons why teachers <b>shift</b> <b>codes</b> in an ESL classroom by using Goffman’s (1981) concept of footing. In English as a Second Language (ESL) classrooms, especially in the rural areas in Sarawak, Malaysian pupils of different levels of proficiency in the target language – English- are placed in the same class. When this happens the ESL teacher has to <b>shift</b> from <b>code</b> to code several times within the same lesson when communicating with pupils having different levels of proficiency in English. This <b>shift</b> in <b>codes</b> helps the teacher get responses from the students. In this paper we demonstrate this change in footing by an ESL teacher during a Reading Comprehension lesson. The reading teacher shifted from English to the national language, Malay which is the medium of instruction in Malaysia and even shifted to Bidayuh (the mother tongue of most of the students) with the objective of facilitating understanding of the text. Both the teacher and the pupils in this case study are Bidayuhs. We contend that if rural pupils find it difficult to understand English then the ESL teacher MUST at times <b>shift</b> <b>codes</b> to facilitate understanding.

40|$|To provide {{high speed}} mobile services, {{orthogonal}} multi-code transmission is {{employed in the}} orthogonal frequency and code division multiplexing (OFCDM) system. However, in a wireless frequency selective channel either with or without Doppler <b>shift,</b> <b>code</b> orthogonality is distorted and multi-code interference (MCI) is caused. The variance of the MCI is dependent on which codes to be used. This paper investigates the code assignment in the OFCDM system, aiming to mitigate the MCI. The code assignment can be explored {{in terms of the}} code distance defined in this paper. Generally, the codes with large code distances to each other should be assigned with high priority. Moreover, to avoid large interference from the powerful code-multiplexed pilot channel, the time spreading code adjacent to the pilot code in the code tree [9] is suggested not be used when the time domain spreading factor is large. The performance of the proposed non-sequential code assignment scheme is analytically evaluated. It has been shown that the system performance can be improved significantly by the non-sequential scheme under various channel conditions, especially when a low to medium system load is assumed. © 2008 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|Surface {{reconstruction}} using coded {{structured light}} {{is considered one}} of the most reliable techniques for high-quality 3 D scanning. With a calibrated projector-camera stereo system, a light pattern is projected onto the scene and imaged by the camera. Correspondences between projected and recovered patterns are computed in the decoding process, which is used to generate 3 D point cloud of the surface. However, the indirect illumination effects on the surface, such as subsurface scattering and interreflections, will raise the difficulties in reconstruction. In this paper, we apply maximum min-SW gray code to reduce the indirect illumination effects of the specular surface. We also analysis the errors when comparing the maximum min-SW gray code and the conventional gray code, which justifies that the maximum min-SW gray code has significant superiority to reduce the indirect illumination effects. To achieve sub-pixel accuracy, we project high frequency sinusoidal patterns onto the scene simultaneously. But for specular surface, the high frequency patterns are susceptible to decoding errors. Incorrect decoding of high frequency patterns will result in a loss of depth resolution. Our method to resolve this problem is combining the low frequency maximum min-SW gray code and the high frequency phase <b>shifting</b> <b>code,</b> which achieves dense 3 D reconstruction for specular surface. Our contributions include: (i) A complete setup of the structured light based 3 D scanning system; (ii) A novel combination technique of the maximum min-SW gray <b>code</b> and phase <b>shifting</b> <b>code.</b> First, phase <b>shifting</b> decoding with sub-pixel accuracy.

40|$|SummaryIt was proved by Ahlswede (1971) that codes whose codewords form a {{group or}} even a linear space do not achieve Shannon's {{capacity}} for discrete memoryless channels even if the decoding procedure is arbitrary. Sharper results were obtained in Part I of this paper. For practical purposes, one is interested not only in codes which allow a short encoding procedure but also an efficient decoding procedure. Linear codes—the codewords form a linear space and the decoding is done by coset leader decoding — have a fairly efficient decoding procedure. But {{in order to achieve}} high rates the following slight generalization turns out to be very useful: We allow the encoder to use a coset of a linear space as a set of codewords. We call these <b>codes</b> <b>shifted</b> linear <b>codes</b> or coset codes. They were implicitly used by Dobrushin (1963). This new code concept has all the advantages of the previous one with respect to encoding and decoding efficiency and enables us to achieve positive rate on discrete memoryless channels whenever Shannon's channel capacity is positive and the length of the alphabet is less or equal to 5 (Theorem 3. 1. 1). (The result holds very likely also for all alphabets with a length a = ps, p prime, s positive integer). A disadvantage of the concepts of linear <b>codes</b> and of <b>shifted</b> linear <b>codes</b> is that they can be defined only for alphabets whose length is a prime power. In order to overcome this difficulty, we introduce generalized <b>shifted</b> linear <b>codes.</b> With these codes we can achieve a positive rate on arbitrary discrete memoryless channels if Shannon's capacity is positive (Theorem 3. 2. 1...|$|R
