500|$|New York {{plastic surgeon}} Dr. Pamela Lipkin, {{who has never}} treated Jackson or {{reviewed}} his medical records, said, [...] "when {{you look at the}} other features, the skin bleaching sort of goes along with what I think was his quest for beauty, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wonder what came first? Vitiligo or lighter skin?" [...] Noting that Jackson had even skin tone when he was younger, Lipkin's interpretation was that [...] "probably he's trying to look Caucasian: His skin is whiter. His nose is getting thinner every six months. His lips are getting thinner. His eyebrows are getting higher. His eyes are getting wider every time. His cheekbones are getting bigger." ...|$|E
500|$|Åkerman {{was born}} in Sweden {{and grew up in}} Canada; she has [...] "conflicting feelings" [...] for the two countries. In an {{interview}} for Toronto Star, she said, [...] "Every time I'm in Canada I feel more Swedish, and every time I'm in Sweden I feel more Canadian. I belong in both places and I love them both equally." [...] She holds both Swedish and Canadian passports. Apart from speaking fluent English and Swedish, she also speaks French and Spanish. She describes herself as a feminist as she believes in equal treatment for both sexes, but also considers that [...] "We [...] are different", adding that she [...] "embrace those differences." [...] She has revealed that she is dyslexic and said that it took her [...] "a long time" [...] to learn her lines. [...] "I get horrified when I have to do table reads with the whole cast, because there’s a lot of stuttering coming from me, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do a lot of prep", she explained. Because of this, she prefers to improvise her lines.|$|E
500|$|Upon his return, {{he found}} that the story {{was not going to be}} used in the current form. Gerrold later said that [...] "I was told that Gene's lawyer did not like the script and felt that this was not a good episode, and so on his advice, it seems, the script was cancelled. That's what I was told by someone who was in a {{position}} to know. I don't have any proof in writing, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> qualify it by saying someone told me." [...] Official sources stated that Paramount became involved, and that the company felt the story was inappropriate for younger viewers in the syndicated marketplace and that complaints would be received from parents. The script was given to Herbert Wright to re-write. Roddenberry gave Wright a number notes on the script, who accidentally handed over notes on the script to Gerrold which were written by Roddenberry's lawyer, Leonard Maizlish. Due to the workload on Wright at the time, Gerrold offered to make a first attempt at the re-write with the intention of removing the homosexual characters. However, after initially clearing that with Roddenberry, Wright later received a phone call from him telling Wright not to let Gerrold work on it. Shortly after, Wright received a second call from Maizlish to reinforce the message that Gerrold must not be allowed to work on the script.|$|E
6000|$|Herbert was not base {{enough to}} let this pass. He muttered, 'A fellow would not {{take my word for}} it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> show him.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> wipe {{myself with}} a {{newspaper}} which <b>I</b> happened <b>to</b> <b>have</b> in my pocket, and a more unsatisfactory thing to dry oneself upon I cannot conceive.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it's {{the fashion}} to kick kings nowadays. I {{was a pretty}} good King--to myself--but those dreadful Oz people wouldn't let me alone. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> abdicate." ...|$|R
2500|$|Braun said Reese's {{feelings}} toward Zach {{can be summed}} up as a [...] "dear, dear friendship and connection on an intimate but not sexual level". She said that Reese has never had a clear point of view. [...] "One minute I think I am playing a storyline that is going one way, and then there is a detour. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make it clear in my head. Yes, it’s not fun playing the outsider who has nobody, and no strong leg to stand on," [...] said Braun. [...] "Reese has been under a microscope since she came to town and doesn't have any family to support her. There is no one around who knows the essence of who she really is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hopkins {{formerly}} {{suffered from}} epilepsy; {{she was being}} hospitalised around once every 10 days in early 2014, she told Decca Aitkenhead: [...] "When I have a fit at night, my arms come out. They dislocate. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go into hospital to have them relocated. That's happened 26 {{times in the last}} nine months". The seizures could occur up to ten times at night, according to Sathnam Sanghera who interviewed her for The Times in mid-2015. They began in her late teens whenever she fell asleep and did not respond to prescribed drugs, she said in 2017. In a piece for The Sun, published the following August, she announced she was considering surgery to help prevent seizures. In mid-November 2015, her condition led her to fall to the ground in the street, injuring her face, and for an ambulance to be called.|$|E
2500|$|Shamrock {{was portrayed}} badly on the show, feuding with his fighters and often {{appearing}} uninterested. Shamrock admitted to doing {{a poor job}} with his fighters: [...] "I failed them miserably, completely. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{figure out a way}} to get this...back in the driver's seat", Shamrock said during the show. Shamrock responded to his critics in an interview: [...] "I trained three fighters that were the first three (UFC) Middleweight Champions: Jerry Bohlander, Guy Mezger and Frank Shamrock. And I’ve trained dozens of guys to be champs in other organizations. In Pancrase, I had eight fighters in the top ten at one point. I was the champion and (Masakatsu) Funaki was the number one contender. The rest were all Lion's Den fighters. My reputation doesn’t have to be spoken for or defended. The UFC and Spike TV did what they thought they needed to do for ratings, but in the end, my fans, my family and my God know exactly who I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Confound the old thing! It always stuck <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> give a jerk. Now, {{there it}} is, topsy-turvy," [...] and Thorny looked Much disgusted {{at his own}} awkwardness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{the corn}} was {{contracted}} for, and father wasn't able <b>to</b> come--he <b>had</b> another attack of neuralgia last night, {{after he got}} the corn loaded, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sanch {{would come}} after Ben; I couldn't make him go home, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> hold on till {{he was safe}} here, else he'd be lost, and then Ben would feel bad." ...|$|R
60|$|You {{always agree}} with me, and there's {{an end of}} it. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> rack my brains again.|$|E
6000|$|Signs notify [...] Napoleon's {{plans as}} changed! He purports now [...] To strike our left--between Sombreffe and Brye.... If <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{readjust}} my ward.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{the only}} way I can get my living," [...] said the butterfly. [...] "Nobody ever gives me anything, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take what I want." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay with me {{till the}} end," [...] she muttered. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> stay, {{wondering}} what Saduko heard Umbelazi whispering to Mameena, and on {{which side of}} me he saw her standing.|$|R
6000|$|... "They did {{not send}} me out this morning," [...] she said, [...] "and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> stay, until <b>I</b> could slip out without being noticed; {{but they may}} miss me at any moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sad to say, Your Royal Highness, <b>I</b> did not! <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> take a {{situation}} as--as Waiter, which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> now held {{for some years}} haven't I?" [...] He again glanced at Lady Muriel.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{sacrifice}} some of {{the things}} I might like to tackle, though I do, by golly, play about as good a game of golf as the next fellow!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jest {{a mile or}} <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{think of}} you, you know. I should feel more easy. If we was locked up, you know--Not that I should mind on my own account--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How could you? I'm {{sorry for}} sick people, and I like to nurse them, {{but it makes}} my legs shake <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> run away. I'm not a brave girl," [...] sighed Daisy.|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> planned Garak not as {{homosexual}} or heterosexual but omnisexual, and {{the first}} episode <b>I</b> <b>had</b> with Bashir played that way gave people fits. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> remove that characteristic from him. Andrew J. Robinson ...|$|R
5000|$|In rural Alabama, the {{depression}} {{days of the}} 1930s and early 1940s were rough. Lum York remembers [...] "I only had two pairs of overalls. My mother washed on Wednesdays <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> wear them all week long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{want the}} bay," [...] {{explained}} Jones, [...] "but I couldn't drive the others without him. When I told that redskin {{that we had}} two lions, he ran off into the woods, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't intend {{going over}} until the afternoon," [...] he said, [...] "but Joe Hemming sent word {{yesterday}} he wouldn't be buying pork after twelve today. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tote my hogs over at once.

6000|$|... "I hope," [...] he said, [...] "you don't {{mind the}} smell," [...] {{which was a}} mingled one of oil-colors and tobacco-smoke. [...] "The woman's putting my office to rights, and it's all {{in a cloud of}} dust. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> bring you in here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{flooring}} is all disconnected at night," [...] he remarked. [...] "I have {{no doubt}} that there is a good deal of gossip in the servants'-hall about this sealed chamber, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> guard myself against some inquisitive ostler or too adventurous butler." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I got in last night, but I couldn't {{find the}} opening, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> anchor outside. <b>I</b> {{never been this}} run before, but my people had some stuff they wanted to bring over here. Gray, d'you know him?" ...|$|R
30|$|The written exam […] is a {{completely}} different kind of evaluation from any other one used in the University because it’s based on cases […] <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> actually apply the concepts that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been learning (Student interview).|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{had spent}} a lot of money when I was young, and the estate, as you call it, was not large enough to bear the loss. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go out and work, and get back what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> squandered.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{unfortunately}} Miss Norman is not here; and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do {{the best}} I can. I really must have some proof that I have fulfilled my trust.

6000|$|... "I can't do everything," [...] said Elsa, in {{that same}} gentle, even voice which held in its tones all the gamut of hopeless discouragement; [...] "since father has been {{stricken}} he wants constant attention.

6000|$|... "I {{know you}} did, m'dear, {{and that is}} where the trouble lies.

And now I can't take Ffoulkes away from his young wife, and Tony and the others are so mighty slow." ...|$|E
6000|$|By {{this time}} he was sitting quietly on the dead mouse with his arms folded, and the weeding wasn't getting on a bit: <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say [...] "Work first, {{pleasure}} afterwards: no more talking till that bed's finished." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{arrived here}} late last night, and all day Aunt Martha has kept her room <b>to</b> rest. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> keep mine also, {{although}} I felt {{as fresh as}} a morning lark, and just {{in the mood for}} enjoyment.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{never thought}} of that. I wanted to fall upon all their necks and bless them; but the stream was running too strong just there to allow of this, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> content myself with mere cold-sounding words of gratitude.|$|R
