40|$|This paper {{presents}} the theoretical modeling and numerical simulation of the probe tip based nanochannel <b>scratching.</b> According to the <b>scratching</b> depth, the probe tip is modeled as a spherical capped conical tip or a spherical capped regular three side pyramid tip {{to calculate the}} normal force needed for the nanochannel <b>scratching.</b> In order to further investigate the impact of <b>scratching</b> speed, <b>scratching</b> depth and <b>scratching</b> direction on the <b>scratching</b> process, the <b>scratching</b> simulation is implemented in LS-DYNA software, and a mesh-less method called smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) {{is used for the}} sample construction. Based on the theoretical and simulated analyses, the increase of the <b>scratching</b> speed, the <b>scratching</b> depth and the face angle will result in an increase in the normal force. At the same <b>scratching</b> depth, the normal forces of the spherical capped regular three side pyramid tip model are different in different <b>scratching</b> directions, which are in agreement with the theoretical calculations in the d 3 and d 4 directions. Moreover, the errors between the theoretical and simulated normal forces increase as the face angle increases...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} rock art sites containing <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs in the Bennett Hills, Idaho. Despite their research potential, <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs have received little attention in rock art research or literature. This study contributes valuable data to <b>scratched</b> rock art {{research and the}} corpus of rock art research in general. Two samples of ten <b>scratched</b> petroglyph sites were examined and recorded {{for a total of}} twenty petroglyph sites. Using formal and contextual research methods, multiple attributes of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are identified and analyzed. The formal qualities of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are examined to define the extent and to characterize the motif assemblage. Formal qualities were also studied to test hypotheses concerning the relationship between <b>scratched</b> and pecked petroglyph styles and associations between <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs and other archaeological phenomena. The contexts of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are studied on site and landscape scales to identify correlations with other archaeological phenomena and environments. The formal analyses revealed that there are more <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs in the Bennett Hills than records and literature currently indicate. Few site records document the presence of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs, although {{as a result of this}} analysis it appears to be ubiquitous in the Bennett Hills. It is possible that <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are under recorded in other locales as well, and that further investigations may identify a greater frequency of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs throughout the Great Basin. Proper identification of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs may alter how these properties are evaluated and in turn how they are managed. The Bennett Hills encompass a limited and unique assemblage of <b>scratched</b> petroglyph motifs that are dissimilar to petroglyphs manufactured using other techniques. This is significant in that it helps support the idea that <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are distinct. Rather than just an alternative method to pecking, <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs serve a unique function that is different from and independent of pecked petroglyphs. Contextual analyses indicated that <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are located in patterned and significant associations with artifacts, features, environments, and landscapes. The contextual analysis suggested that <b>scratched</b> rock art was produced in a public context in close proximity to subsistence related activities, perhaps in association with resource gathering events. There are various hypotheses that deal with the interaction between <b>scratched</b> and pecked petroglyph styles. <b>Scratched</b> petroglyphs occur both independent of and in association with other pecked petroglyph styles, although <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs do not commonly occur with any one pecked motif. When <b>scratched</b> and pecked petroglyph styles overlap <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are always later than and superimposed over earlier pecked petroglyphs. Data was collected to test three hypotheses concerning the intention of association between <b>scratched</b> and pecked petroglyphs. It does not appear that <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs serve to obliterate earlier pecked petroglyphs or function as a sketch that would be pecked later. There is evidence that some <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs enhance earlier pecked petroglyphs however, this hypothesis cannot sufficiently describe the range of patterns and associations found in the Bennett Hills <b>scratched</b> petroglyph assemblage. Hypotheses suggesting associations between <b>scratched</b> rock art and other archaeological phenomena were also examined. The association between <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs and <b>scratched</b> stones is deserving of further research. It may also be too soon to dismiss the association between <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs and quartz. The examination of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs in the Bennett Hills provides a unique insight into the minds of the makers of these petroglyphs, contributing valuable data our knowledge of the prehistoric peoples of the Bennett Hills and surrounding areas...|$|R

40|$|Pruritus (itch) is {{a severe}} side effect {{associated}} with the use of drugs as well as hepatic and hematological disorders. Previous studies in rodents suggest that bombesin receptor subtypes i. e. receptors for gastrin-releasing peptide (GRPr) and neuromedin B (NMBr) differentially regulate itch <b>scratching.</b> However, to what degree spinal GRPr and NMBr regulate <b>scratching</b> evoked by intrathecally administered bombesin-related peptides is not known. The first aim of this study was to pharmacologically compare the dose-response curves for <b>scratching</b> induced by intrathecally administered bombesin-related peptides versus morphine, which is known to elicit itch in humans. The second aim was to determine if spinal GRPr and NMBr selectively or generally mediate <b>scratching</b> behavior. Mice received intrathecal injection of bombesin (0. 01 - 0. 3 nmol), GRP (0. 01 - 0. 3 nmol), NMB (0. 1 - 1 nmol) or morphine (0. 3 - 3 nmol) and were observed for one hour for <b>scratching</b> activity. Bombesin elicited most profound <b>scratching</b> over one hour followed by GRP and NMB, whereas morphine failed to evoke <b>scratching</b> response indicating the insensitivity of mouse models to intrathecal opioid-induced itch. Intrathecal pretreatment with GRPr antagonist RC- 3095 (0. 03 - 0. 1 nmol) produced a parallel rightward shift in the dose response curve of GRP-induced <b>scratching</b> but not NMB-induced <b>scratching.</b> Similarly, PD 168368 (1 - 3 nmol) only attenuated NMB but not GRP-induced <b>scratching.</b> Individual or co-administration of RC- 3095 and PD 168368 failed to alter bombesin-evoked <b>scratching.</b> A higher dose of RC- 3095 (0. 3 nmol) generally suppressed <b>scratching</b> induced by all three peptides but also compromised motor function in the rotarod test. Together, these data indicate that spinal GRPr and NMBr independently drive itch neurotransmission in mice and may not mediate bombesin-induced <b>scratching.</b> GRPr antagonists at functionally receptor-selective doses only block spinal GRP-elicited <b>scratching</b> but the suppression of <b>scratching</b> at higher doses is confounded by motor impairment...|$|R

40|$|Based on the self-developed three {{dimensional}} micro/nano machining system, {{the effects}} of machining parameters and sample material on micro/nano machining are investigated. The micro/nano machining system is mainly composed of the probe system and micro/nano positioning stage. The former is applied to control the normal load and the latter is utilized to realize high precision motion in the xy plane. A sample examination method is firstly introduced to estimate whether the sample is placed horizontally. The machining parameters include <b>scratching</b> direction, speed, cycles, normal load and feed. According to the experimental results, the <b>scratching</b> depth is significantly affected by the normal load in all four defined <b>scratching</b> directions but is rarely influenced by the <b>scratching</b> speed. The increase of <b>scratching</b> cycle number can increase the <b>scratching</b> depth as well as smooth the groove wall. In addition, the <b>scratching</b> tests of silicon and copper attest that the harder material is easier to be removed. In the <b>scratching</b> with different feed amount, the machining {{results indicate that the}} machined depth increases as the feed reduces. Further, a cubic polynomial is used to fit the experimental results to predict the <b>scratching</b> depth. With the selected machining parameters of <b>scratching</b> direction d 3 /d 4, <b>scratching</b> speed 5 μm/s and feed 0. 06 μm, some more micro structures including stair, sinusoidal groove, Chinese character ‘田’, ‘TJU’ and Chinese panda have been fabricated on the silicon substrate...|$|R

40|$|Bombesin is a pruritogenic {{agent that}} causes intense itch-scratching {{activity}} in rodents. Bombesin has high {{affinity for the}} gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptor (GRPr) and the neuromedin B (NMB) receptor (NMBr). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate pharmacologically the ability of GRPr and NMBr to elicit <b>scratching</b> behavior in rats. The intracerebroventricular route was selected for drug delivery because the study focused on supraspinal sites of action. The magnitude and duration of <b>scratching</b> produced by the naturally occurring peptides GRP and NMB were characterized. Antagonists selective for GRPr [(d-Tpi 6, Leu 13 Ψ(CH 2 -NH) -Leu 14) Bombesin(6 - 14) (RC- 3095) ] and NMBr [(S) -α-methyl-α-[[[(4 -nitrophenyl) amino]carbonyl]amino]-N-[[1 -(2 -pyridinyl) cyclohexyl]methyl]- 1 H-indole- 3 -propanamide (PD 168368) ] were used to define the role of GRPr and NMBr in the <b>scratching</b> response. After intracerebroventricular administration, GRP (0. 03 – 0. 3 nmol) and NMB (0. 1 – 1 nmol) dose-dependently elicited marked <b>scratching.</b> There was a tolerance to <b>scratching</b> elicited by daily repeated administration of bombesin, GRP, or NMB. Presession administration of RC- 3095 (0. 1 – 1 nmol) and PD 168368 (0. 3 – 3 nmol) dose-dependently antagonized <b>scratching</b> elicited by GRP and NMB, respectively.
