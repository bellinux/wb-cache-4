60|$|She said no more. The still pause lengthened. <b>She</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> {{meet his}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|Later on, <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> speak again, {{and asked}} the old man his name.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> {{look into}} his face, and started to find his eyes so terribly penetrating.|$|E
50|$|Yet <b>she</b> <b>forces</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> do so.|$|R
50|$|Miranti (Jenny Rachman) is left a widow {{after her}} pilot husband dies in an accident. <b>She</b> <b>forces</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> work independently, despite feeling alienated. She soon learns that her {{brother-in-law}} Dimas (Roy Marten) cares greatly for her. Miranti ultimately realises that his feelings {{are more than}} just pity, and the two can unite.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>She's</b> <b>forcing</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> it, poor dear little thing; and you've no notion what she's suffering. I {{was never}} much for {{religion}} nor against it, but it can't be right {{to let her}} do this, and you ought to persuade her out of it. Of course everybody will say {{it was very good}} and forgiving of 'ee to take her to 'ee again. But for my part I don't." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{had been}} making little efforts as if to rise; now <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> her feet, and ran from the room.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> speak through lips {{suddenly}} pale. What strange {{words they}} sounded, frozen things, scarcely audible! Yet the effort hurt her.|$|E
6000|$|One bitter drop always marred the {{pleasure}} of that hour; for when she had asked for Mrs. Sterling, and sent her love, <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> say kindly: ...|$|E
5000|$|Throughout {{the book}} {{it seems as}} though Helen and Giles Carnaby, the lawyer, will end up in a happy relationship. This does not happen, as Giles turns out to be {{something}} of a philanderer; but the relationship seems beneficial <b>to</b> Helen as <b>she</b> <b>forces</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> {{take an active role in}} breaking it off, rather than letting events take their course passively as when her mother was alive, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the midst}} of so much chatter, Sire?" [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>forcing</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> smile gaily. [...] "Nay, but 'tis a serious matter--and I must consult with my father." ...|$|R
60|$|So, {{when the}} morning {{came of age}} {{and it was time}} to rise, by no action, look, or sign, did she betray the {{presence}} of the unusual in her soul. If this which was before her must be done, it would be carried out as though it were of no import, as though it were a daily action; nor did <b>she</b> <b>force</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> quietude, or pride herself thereon, but acted thus from instinct, the instinct for avoiding fuss and unnecessary suffering that was bred in her.|$|R
6000|$|... "What can I tell you?" [...] Helen reflected, {{speaking}} more {{to herself}} in a rambling style than as a prophetess delivering a message. <b>She</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> speak.|$|E
6000|$|... "I should like," [...] she began, and hesitated quite a {{long time}} before <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> add, with a change of voice, [...] "to study mathematics--to know about the stars." ...|$|E
60|$|But Lucy {{would not}} allow herself, even for a moment, to doubt her father. Now that {{she thought of the}} matter, she saw that it was absurd. <b>She</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> give a laugh.|$|E
6000|$|An unwonted {{resolution}} {{came into}} her face. Her lips whitened. [...] "Don't you know, Rag," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>forcing</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> speak----"Don't you guess? You don't know half! In that bureau there----In there! It's stuffed with bills. Unpaid bills." ...|$|R
5000|$|Her {{off-screen}} {{life and}} personality {{during those years}} was quite different from what audiences assumed. She {{spent much of her}} time feeling lonely and homesick. She might swim at her agent's pool, but shunned the beaches and staring crowds. When asked for an autograph, she wondered why anyone would want it. Writer Howard Sharpe interviewed her and gave his impression: Hedy has the most incredible personal sophistication. She knows the peculiarly European art of being womanly; she knows what men want in a beautiful woman, what attracts them; and <b>she</b> <b>forces</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> be these things. She has magnetism with warmth, something that neither Dietrich nor Garbo has managed to achieve.|$|R
60|$|She {{seemed about}} to go on, but she stopped, and again he waited. At length <b>she</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>force</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> speak.|$|R
6000|$|The {{young lady}} laughed again, {{but she did}} not say {{anything}} further, and a space of silence fell so long that by-and-by <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> say, [...] "My cousin findeth not the ball presently." ...|$|E
60|$|From {{this day}} <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> take pains to avoid him--never {{allowing}} herself, as formerly, to remain long in his company, {{even if their}} juxtaposition were purely accidental. She gave the other three every chance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you think}} you can help us with the concert," [...] <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> say. Oh, if only Irene would stop looking at that boot! Rilla could just hear her giving Olive Kirk an account of it.|$|E
60|$|Therefore <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> not <b>to</b> look on that departing, sable-clad figure, on {{that evil}} face, and those hands that held Percy's fate in their cruel grip; but her ears caught the welcome {{sound of his}} departure--the opening and {{shutting}} of the door, his light footstep echoing down the stone stairs.|$|R
50|$|The {{theme of}} choice is evident through the {{characters}} of Leonardo, the bride, and the bridegroom. The bride is very conflicted because <b>she</b> <b>forces</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> marry the bridegroom, when in reality she is {{still in love with}} Leonardo. Leonardo, despite being married, is also still madly in love with the bride. Their combined choice to run away with each other after the marriage is one that manifests their latent and pent up desires left over from their previous relationship. The bridegroom is in love with his bride-to-be, however. Despite the fact that she lives in a cave located hours away, the bridegroom still loves the bride and takes her as the woman he wants to remain with for the remainder of his life.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But I {{must go to}} Mary!' cried Louis, {{as though}} {{reproaching}} himself for the delay. 'Oh! that <b>she</b> should have <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> that wedding, and spared me!' ...|$|R
60|$|They did not answer, but stopped, {{and she sat}} on {{a boulder}} by the wayside. They stood {{motionless}} in front of her, waiting patiently till she was ready. After a little while <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> get up.|$|E
60|$|Anne had {{an uncomfortable}} {{conviction}} that Mr. Harrison was right, and <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> expunge {{most of her}} beloved descriptions, though it took three re-writings before the story could be pruned down to please the fastidious Mr. Harrison.|$|E
6000|$|He durst not glance towards her, or {{he would}} have seen her cheek white as wax, and her eye seeking his in dismayed inquiry. There was a pause; then <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> falter--'Yes. I suppose it is very right--very grand. It is settled?' ...|$|E
2500|$|Alisa is a half-blood witch {{with the}} powers of a full-blood witch. Initially, {{she was afraid of}} Wicca, but when she finds out she is part witch, <b>she</b> <b>forces</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> confront her powers. She finds her mother's Book of Shadows after Morgan {{receives}} it from the owner of the store [...] "Practical Magick". Within the Book of Shadows, Alisa finds out that her mother, Sarah Curtis, had stripped herself of her powers in fear of them, which inadvertently resulted in Alisa inheriting those powers. It turns out that in Alisa's family, the firstborn female is cursed with uncontrollable telekinesis. Alisa also possesses this power and, as it is later revealed, so does her grandmother. Alisa meets her mother's family later in the series and even receives her mother's tools from her grandmother.|$|R
60|$|She {{deliberately}} {{turned to}} the left, and once more traversed the vast and gorgeous halls where, half an hour ago, she had suffered such keen humiliation and such overwhelming disappointment. <b>She</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> not <b>to</b> dwell on that scene again, and even closed her eyes with a vague fear that the mental vision might become materialized.|$|R
50|$|Williams writes from {{personal}} experience, {{and many of}} her songs are based on people she grew up with. <b>She</b> doesn't <b>force</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> write, which is an approach she learned in college when she decided that whatever she could do {{at any given time}} was enough. She prides herself on having songs that all came from some kind of inspiration.|$|R
6000|$|... "And why not? What can he {{possibly}} {{have learned to}} your injury?" [...] And then as it seemed to Lady Mason that Mr. Furnival expected some reply to this question, <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> give him one. [...] "I suppose that he cannot know anything." ...|$|E
60|$|Lucy felt on {{a sudden}} sick at heart. She {{began to tremble}} a little, {{and it was only}} by great {{strength}} of will that <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> go on. She was horribly frightened. Her mouth was dry, and when at last the words came, her voice sounded unnatural.|$|E
6000|$|Next morning, remorselessly {{carrying}} out that plan, <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> smile and talk {{as if nothing}} had happened, watching the relief in his face, his obvious delight at the change, with a fearful aching in her heart. She waited till he was ready to go down, and then, still smiling, said: ...|$|E
50|$|Since the mid-00's she {{has only}} {{appeared}} in gossip {{programs such as}} Sálvame Deluxe where <b>she</b> found <b>herself</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> defend <b>herself</b> from slanderous claims made about her by journalist Lydia Lozano.|$|R
60|$|He came {{quite close}} <b>to</b> her, and <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> not <b>to</b> draw back one inch. For {{the sake of}} the {{fugitive}} prince and his friends, who had trusted in the honour of France; for the sake of that honour which, in her peculiar position, was as dear to her as her own, she would not flinch now; she would show no repulsion, no fear, though her whole being rose in revolt at contact with this man.|$|R
50|$|Mumtaz (Tabu) is a naive young rural {{woman whose}} family is killed in {{communal}} riots. After her village is burnt to the ground, {{she moves to}} Mumbai with her uncle, the only family member she has left. They are desperately poor and her uncle persuades her to become a bar girl (dancer) at Chandni Bar. He promises her that this is merely temporary, until {{he is able to}} get a job. Mumtaz is shy and loathes the work, but <b>she</b> <b>forces</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> dance and flirt. However, her uncle doesn't keep his word; he lives on her earnings, drinking them away, and never gets a job. One night, after spending time drinking and watching the girls dance at the bar, Mumtaz's uncle rapes her. Mumtaz is distraught and emotionally confides in the other dancers. Even though they console her, Mumtaz is given a reality check when she realises that many other women at the bar have equally disturbing and painful stories. She manages <b>to</b> pull <b>herself</b> together and immerses herself in her work at the bar.|$|R
