25|$|In 1966, the British {{government}} {{purchased the}} privately owned copra plantations and closed them. Over {{the next five}} years, the British authorities forcibly and clandestinely removed {{the entire population of}} about 2,000 people, known as Chagossians (or Ilois), from Diego Garcia and two other Chagos atolls, Peros Banhos and Salomon Islands, to Mauritius. In 1971, the United Kingdom and the United States signed a treaty, leasing the island of Diego Garcia to the US military for the purposes of building a large air and naval base on the island. The deal was important to the UK government, as the United States granted it a <b>substantial</b> <b>discount</b> on the purchase of Polaris nuclear missiles in return {{for the use of the}} islands as a base. The strategic location of the island was also significant at the centre of the Indian Ocean, and to counter any Soviet threat in the region.|$|E
500|$|The film {{begins with}} the {{coronation}} of Karl Alexander, Duke of Württemberg (Heinrich George), a man much beloved by his Swabian people, who swears an oath to obey {{the laws of the}} dukedom [...] "according to the traditional Württemberg loyalty and honesty." [...] However, the Duke soon becomes frustrated because the Württemberg Diet (the provincial council) refuses him the funds needed to maintain a lifestyle comparable to his neighboring sovereigns; in particular, he wants a personal bodyguard, an opera company, and a ballet company. Lacking funds even to purchase coronation gifts for the Duchess (Hilde von Stolz), the Duke sends a courtier to Frankfurt to borrow money from Joseph Süß Oppenheimer (Ferdinand Marian). Süß shows the emissary jewels and jewelry that are obviously beyond the Duke's means and then says that it would be his honor to provide the Duke with jewelry at a <b>substantial</b> <b>discount.</b> However, Süß insists on presenting the items to the Duke personally despite a ban against Jews (Judensperre) entering the city that has been in force for over a century. Armed with a pass from the Duke, Süß cuts his hair, shaves his beard, and dons [...] "Christian" [...] clothes so that he can enter Württemberg disguised as a Christian. As his carriage gets into an accident, Süß gets a lift from Dorothea Sturm (Kristina Söderbaum) to the city.|$|E

2500|$|Zero-coupon bonds (zeros) pay no regular {{interest}}. They {{are issued}} at a <b>substantial</b> <b>discount</b> to par value, {{so that the}} interest is effectively rolled up to maturity (and usually taxed as such).

In other words, the separated coupons and the final principal payment of the bond may be traded separately. [...] See IO (Interest Only) and PO (Principal Only).|$|E
2500|$|Marketing became {{important}} to the phenomenal rise of the furniture industry in North Carolina in the twentieth century. Store owners had to visit the factory to select their orders due to the large size and weight of the furniture. This situation improved {{at the turn of}} the century with the mass marketing and sales of North Carolina furniture from the catalogues of Sears Roebuck and Co. At the same time, competitors in large cities like New York and Chicago held a national exposition twice a year to display the manufacturers' products and to take orders from furniture dealers and buyers. Recognizing the need for a more convenient southern location, High Point furniture manufacturers began planning for an exposition to display and sell their product to the public. The first North Carolina furniture exposition was held in High Point in 1905. In 1921, a brand new Southern Furniture Exhibition Building was built with ten stories and [...] at a cost of $2 million. The event that became known as the High Point Furniture Market was attended by 700 buyers and generated $2.25 million in sales. High Point had overtaken Chicago as the site of the nation's most important semi-annual furniture show. Gradually the High Point Furniture Market, held in April and October, has grown into an internationally renowned furniture trade fair for all home furnishings. High Point continues to be the prime location in the United States to purchase brand-name furniture at a <b>substantial</b> <b>discount.</b>|$|E
