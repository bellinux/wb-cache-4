25|$|The {{last two}} metrics appear {{for example in}} routing a machine that drills a given <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> in a printed circuit board. The Manhattan metric {{corresponds}} to a machine that adjusts first one co-ordinate, and then the other, so the time {{to move to a}} new point is the sum of both movements. The maximum metric corresponds to a machine that adjusts both co-ordinates simultaneously, so the time to move to a new point is the slower of the two movements.|$|E

50|$|Various designs {{attempt to}} improve on the basic concept {{in any number of}} ways. One common change is to use two sets of holes, each {{designed}} specifically to be efficient at capturing or releasing the gas. In this case the forward <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> is similar to the single-hole example, but a second rearward <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> is added, using check valves (typically ball bearings in a pit) to allow the high-pressure gases in, but not out again. The system may be arranged to allow the gases to escape through the forward <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> before the shell reaches it, causing a partial vacuum to develop directly behind the shell, aiding extraction.|$|E

50|$|Most of the molars {{display a}} very marked wear that {{is typical of}} the prehispanic Nicaragua population, the upper molars are spent in the form of channel, {{attrition}} in the enamel and well-worn dental cusps, teeth of this specimen were compared with a collection of dental pieces belonging to archaeological excavations and indigenous people.

5000|$|There were {{a number}} of {{engineering}} challenges to overcome in designing an autoloading [...]22 WMR handgun such as extraction problems. The extraction problems stem {{from the fact that the}} slow burning rifle powder of the [...]22 WMR cartridge develops a late peak pressure. This can cause the case mouth to expand and jam in the chamber when fired from a handgun. AMT overcame this issue by drilling 18 holes at 90 degrees to the chamber. A sleeve was then welded over the chamber; providing a tiny amount of clearance for the excess gas to escape from the first <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> on back to the second set, thereby relieving the pressure enough to prevent the case from sticking.|$|E
50|$|The {{evacuator}} is {{a simple}} passive device. It consists of a ring of holes drilled into the barrel, surrounded by a cylindrical pressure reservoir. As the shell moves down the barrel during firing, it creates a high pressure {{in front of the}} projectile and the evacuator is filled with high pressure air, it reaches a point where the base of the shell passes the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes.</b> The high-pressure is then released through these holes. As the shell continues down the barrel the pressure begins to drop, and then suddenly returns to near atmospheric pressure as the shell leaves the barrel. During this process the high-pressure air in the reservoir begins to blow back into the barrel towards the front of the gun tube. By aiming these holes forward, their exhaust causes the pressurized air to be blown forward and out of the barrel extracting fumes from the barrel.|$|E

40|$|We {{prove the}} non-existence of maximal partial spreads of size 76 in PG(3, 9). Relying on the {{classification}} of the minimal blocking sets of size 15 in PG(2, 9) [22], we show {{that there are only}} two possibilities for the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> of such a maximal partial spread. The weight argument of Blokhuis and Metsch [3] then shows that these sets cannot be the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> of a maximal partial spread of size 76. In [17], the non-existence of maximal partial spreads of size 75 in PG(3, 9) is proven. This altogether proves that the largest maximal partial spreads, different from a spread, in PG(3, q = 9) have size q 2 − q + 2 = 74. ...|$|E
40|$|We give a {{geometric}} {{description of the}} <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> in a non-normal affine monoid $Q$.

From this, we see how various properties of $k[Q]$ like local normality and Serre's conditions $(R_ 1) $ and $(S_ 2) $ are encoded in the geometry of the holes. A combinatorial upper bound for the depth the monoid algebra $k[Q]$ is obtained and some cases where equality holds are identified. We apply this results to seminormal affine monoids.
