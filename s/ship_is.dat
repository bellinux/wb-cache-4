5|$|International law {{requires}} that every merchant ship be registered in a country. The country in which a <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> registered is its flag state, and the flag state gives the ship the right to fly its civil ensign. A ship's flag state exercises regulatory control over the vessel and is required to inspect it regularly, certify the ship's equipment and crew, and issue safety and pollution prevention documents. A ship operates under the laws of its flag state, and these laws are used if the <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> involved in an admiralty case. The organization which actually registers the <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> known as its registry. Registries may be governmental or private agencies.|$|E
5|$|A Rebel <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> {{captured}} by a Star Destroyer. On the ship are the droids C-3PO (Quagmire), R2-D2 (Cleveland) and the rebel leader Princess Leia (Lois). While the <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> boarded by stormtroopers, Leia tries {{to send an}} MPEG to Obi-Wan Kenobi through R2, but encounters so many complications that R2 offers to deliver the message himself. Leia is {{captured by}} Darth Vader (Stewie) while R2 and 3PO flee to Tatooine in an escape pod, where they are captured by Jawas.|$|E

5000|$|About 41 <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{built for}} the Soviet Navy, One <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> lost to an {{accidental}} explosion in the Black Sea in 1989. All the <b>Ships</b> <b>were</b> decommissioned by the mid-1990s ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{commissioned}} on 19 September 1939 by Harland and Wolff from Belfast in Northern Ireland. The <b>ship's</b> keel <b>was</b> laid on 22 May 1940, and the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{launched on}} 2 September. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> commissioned in about one month later, on 18 October.|$|R
50|$|These <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{designed}} for a surface warfare role. Soviet priorities were changed to an anti-submarine role and only 4 <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> built with this configuration. These <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> followed by the , an anti-submarine derivative.|$|R
5|$|Ikaruga is a {{vertically}} scrolling shoot 'em up. The game features five stages, {{three levels}} of difficulty, and supports single-player or two-player cooperative modes. The player pilots the Ikaruga fighter, moving to avoid obstacles and other danger. A key gameplay feature to Ikaruga is its polarity system. The player can press a button at any time to switch the polarity of their ship between black and white. When white, the ship will absorb white bullets fired by enemies and store their power until released with a special attack. However, if the <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> white and hit by black bullets, it will be destroyed. The opposite is true when the <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> black. Enemy fighters also have black and white polarities. If the player <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> white and the enemy is black, the player's bullets will do twice the damage than if their ship was black. If an enemy is destroyed with the same polarity as the player, the ship will expel energy which can be absorbed or, if the player changes polarities too quickly, present a fatal danger.|$|E

5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{is a form}} {{of military}} deception in which a <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> painted in one or more colors in order to obscure or confuse an enemy's visual observation. Several types of marine camouflage have been used or prototyped: blending or crypsis, in which a paint scheme attempts to hide a ship from view; deception, in which a <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> made to look smaller or, as with the Q-ships, to mimic merchantmen; and dazzle, a chaotic paint scheme which tries to confuse any estimate of distance, direction, or heading. Counterillumination, to hide a darkened ship against the slightly brighter night sky, was trialled by the Royal Canadian Navy in diffused lighting camouflage.|$|E
5000|$|In all, twenty <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{built for}} the Soviet Navy, one <b>ship</b> (...) <b>was</b> later {{transferred}} to Poland, while five similar <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> built to a modified design for the Indian Navy as the Rajput class.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{laid down}} on 21 October 2008 at the Nordic Yards Wismar in Wismar, Germany with the yard number 147. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{launched}} as Cynthia on 27 January 2009 and work was completed on the vessel on 1 May 2010. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> renamed Amorito in 2010. That same year the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> renamed again to Neermoor, operating under an Antigua and Barbuda flag while owned by Briese Schiffahrts GmbH & Co KG. In 2013 the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> renamed Asterix.|$|R
50|$|Similar <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{built in}} Leningrad also. Leningrad-build <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{almost the same}} as Moscow-build ships, but their {{superstructure}} was little bit lower than on Moscow-build <b>ships.</b> The reason <b>was</b> that Leningrad had many low bridges. Leningrad-built <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> known as Leningradets-type ships, project 564K.|$|R

50|$|A {{total of}} 68 <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> built by Nikolayev yards (20 ships), Komsomolsk na Amure (7 ships) and Kaliningrad (the lead yard 41 <b>ships).</b> Most <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{decommissioned}} by 1980, however some {{were sold to}} China. The programme was cut short by Nikita Khrushchev in 1956 as the <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> becoming obsolete and the last <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> completed in 1959.|$|R
50|$|During {{the summer}} months of 2008, a {{competition}} for naming the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> held. Since the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> never delivered to Viking Line, {{the winner of the}} contest and the final name of the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> never published.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the episode, {{concerns}} arise over shipboard fraternization. After Captain Janeway and Chakotay (Robert Beltran) {{discuss whether}} the <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> an appropriate {{place to raise}} children, Ensign Samantha Wildman (Nancy Hower) announces that she is pregnant by her husband, who {{is still in the}} Alpha Quadrant.|$|E
5|$|Two {{ships of}} the United States Navy have been christened USS Nassau; USS Nassau (LHA-4), an amphibious assault <b>ship,</b> <b>is</b> named {{specifically}} {{in recognition of}} this battle, while USS Nassau (CVE-16) was named for Nassau Sound, the body of water {{off the coast of}} Florida near Jacksonville.|$|E
5|$|All battleships are top {{heavy and}} tend to settle upside down when they sink. Arkansas settled upside down, but a 1989 diver's sketch of the wreck shows hardly any of the {{starboard}} side of the hull, making it look like the <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> lying on her side. Most of the starboard side is present, but severely compacted.|$|E

5|$|Flag of {{convenience}} (FOC) {{is a business}} practice whereby a merchant <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> registered in a country other {{than that of the}} ship's owners, and the ship flies that country's civil ensign. Owners of a ship may register the ship under a flag {{of convenience}} to reduce operating costs or avoid the regulations of the owner's country. The closely related term open registry, which describes a ship register that will register foreign-owned ships, also exists.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ships</b> <b>are</b> also {{considered}} units and can perform different tasks. Fishing ships can gather {{food in the}} form of fish, merchant <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> the nautical alternative to traders, and other <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> designed for naval battle or troop transport.|$|R
50|$|Barrack <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> common {{during the}} era of sailing ships when shore {{facilities}} were scarce or non-existent. Barrack <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> usually hulks.

5|$|<b>Ships</b> <b>were</b> {{sometimes}} camouflaged {{in classical}} times. Mediterranean pirate <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> sometimes painted blue-gray for concealment. Vegetius records that Julius Caesar's scout <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> painted bluish-green when gathering intelligence {{along the coast}} of Britain during the Gallic Wars. <b>Ships</b> <b>were</b> sometimes painted deceptively during the Age of Sail, while both sides in the American Civil War camouflaged their ships, whether to run blockades or for night reconnaissance.|$|R
5|$|Great Britains {{builders}} recognised {{a number}} of advantages of iron over the traditional wooden hull. Wood was becoming more expensive, while iron was getting cheaper. Iron hulls were not subject to dry rot or woodworm, and they were also lighter in weight and less bulky. The chief advantage of the iron hull was its much greater structural strength. The practical limit {{on the length of}} a wooden-hulled <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> about 300feet, after which hoggingâ€”the flexing of the hull as waves pass beneath itâ€”becomes too great. Iron hulls are far less subject to hogging, so that the potential size of an iron-hulled <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> much greater. The ship's designers, led by Brunel, were initially cautious in the adaptation of their plans to iron hulled-technology. With each successive draft however, the ship grew ever larger and bolder in conception. By the fifth draft, the vessel had grown to 3,400tons, over 1,000tons larger than any ship then in existence.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the game}} {{features}} {{a variety of}} weapons which can be utilised to destroy other opponents or for self-defence. Offensive weapons include rockets, plasma bolts, missiles, and grenades, whilst defensive weapons range from deployable mines to energy shields. Every <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> also equipped with a standard energy shield which will protect the player from damage caused by collisions or weapons fire. If a shield runs out, the ship will explode and the player in question will be eliminated from the race.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September 2014, the {{expedition}} announced that on 7 September it had located one of Franklin's two ships. The <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> preserved {{in very good}} condition, with side-scan sonar picking up even the deck planking. The wreck lies {{at the bottom of}} the eastern portion of Queen Maud Gulf, west of O'Reilly Island. On 1 October at the House of Commons, Prime Minister Stephen Harper confirmed that the wreck is indeed HMS Erebus.|$|E
2500|$|The third SS Empress of China was a 21,860-ton vessel {{launched}} in 1913 from Stettin, Germany, as the SS Tirpitz.
