It is a day-flying moth, noxious-tasting, with brilliant warning colour in flight, but cryptic at rest. The moth is colonial in habit, and prefers marshy ground or hedgerows. The preferred food of the larvae is the herb Comfrey (Symphytum officinale). In England {{it has one}} generation per year.|$|E

50|$|Aside from football, {{the stadium}} has also hosted two other {{large-scale}} events. On 28 April 2002 the stadium hosted a semi-final of rugby's Heineken Cup in which Leicester <b>Tigers</b> beat Llanelli <b>Scarlets</b> 13-12. Leicester <b>Tigers</b> once again played at City Ground {{when they were}} defeated 16-19 by Racing 92 on 24 April 2016 in the semi-final of the European Rugby Champions Cup. The stadium hosted its first music concert when R.E.M. performed {{there in front of}} an audience of 20,000.|$|R
50|$|The site {{contains}} many invertebrates including the uncommon <b>scarlet</b> <b>tiger</b> moth (Callimorpha dominula) and the nationally scarce pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne). Pasture areas within the site supports the scarce hornet robberfly (Asilus crabroniformis).|$|E
50|$|In 1961 Sheppard {{started a}} colony of <b>scarlet</b> <b>tiger</b> moths by the Wirral Way, West Kirby, Merseyside, which were rediscovered in 1988 by Cyril Clarke, who {{continued}} to observe them in his retirement to study changes in the moth population.|$|E
50|$|Clarke {{answered}} an advert in {{an insect}} magazine for swallowtail butterfly pupae {{that had been}} placed by Philip Sheppard. They met and began working together in their common interest of lepidoptery. From 1959 they started running a moth trap in Caldy Common near West Kirby, Wirral, England. They studied the peppered moth, the <b>scarlet</b> <b>tiger</b> moth and swallowtail butterfly. They published papers on the genetics of Lepidoptera and also on Rh disease. Clarke continued research in his retirement and in 1988 he rediscovered a <b>scarlet</b> <b>tiger</b> moth colony on the Wirral Way, West Kirby, that had been started in 1961 by Philip Sheppard. The colony was useful for study of the genetics of changes in populations.|$|E

Butterflies and moths which can be found here include the dark green {{fritillary}} and gatekeeper butterflies and the <b>scarlet</b> <b>tiger</b> and Portland moths.|$|E

50|$|This data is from E.B. Ford (1971) on the <b>Scarlet</b> <b>tiger</b> moth, {{for which}} the phenotypes of {{a sample of the}} {{population}} were recorded.

The null hypothesis is that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg proportions, and the alternative hypothesis is that the population is not in Hardy-Weinberg proportions.|$|E

50|$|Racing in England {{remained}} severely {{restricted by}} the War and Turkhan {{was sent to}} neutral Ireland to contest the Irish Derby. Ridden by Smirke, he started the 4/11 favourite and won by two lengths from <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Tiger</b> to win a £2,500 first prize.

5000|$|Callimorpha dominula has a {{wingspan}} of 45 - 55 mm. Adults of {{this species}} are quite variable in color. The forewings usually have a metallic green sheen on the blackish areas, with white and yellow or orange markings. Hindwings are red with three large and irregular black markings. These moths may also occur in rare colour forms, one with yellow hindwings and body and one with extended black on hindwings. The thorax is black glossed with green and shows two longitudinal short yellow stripes. [...] The abdomen is black. <b>Scarlet</b> <b>tiger</b> moth has developed mouthparts, that allow it to feed on nectar. The caterpillars can reach a length of about 40 mm. They are dark gray with yellow stripes and small white dots.|$|E
50|$|Animal {{species such}} as the water vole, grass snake, reed bunting, brown trout, and brook lamprey {{flourish}} here, despite being in decline {{in other parts of}} the country. Crayfish are very common in parts of the river. However, most, if not all, are now the alien American signal crayfish, having escaped from crayfish farms, which has replaced the native white-clawed crayfish in most southern rivers, although a small population still survives in the River Lambourn. And not forgetting the foundation to supporting this varied wildlife food chain, there are the insects, many hundreds of species, common and rare, that can be found in and around the River Kennet. There are large hatches of mayflies, whose long-tailed, short-lived adults are a favourite food of trout; many species of water beetle and insect larvae. Caddisflies are also very numerous, especially in the late summer. Alongside the river, the reed beds, grasses and other vegetation support many other insect species, including the <b>scarlet</b> <b>tiger</b> moth, poplar hawk moths and privet hawks.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of the <b>scarlet</b> <b>tiger</b> moth Callimorpha (Panaxia) dominula (family Arctiidae), which is a diurnal moth occurs in {{continental}} Europe, western Asia and southern England, three forms occur in England: the typical homozygote; the rare homozygote (bimacula) and the heterozygote (medionigra). It was studied there by E. B. Ford, and later by P. M. Sheppard and their co-workers over many years. Data is available from 1939 to the present day, got by the usual field method of capture-mark-release-recapture and by genetic analysis from breeding in captivity. The records cover gene frequency and population size for much of the twentieth century. In this instance the genetics appears to be simple: two alleles at a single locus, producing the three phenotypes. Total captures over 26 years 1939-1964 came to 15,784 homozygous dominula (i.e. typica), 1,221 heterozygous medionigra and 28 homozygous bimacula. Now, assuming equal viability of the genotypes 1,209 heterozygotes would be expected, so the field results do not suggest any heterozygous advantage. It was Sheppard who found that the polymorphism is maintained by selective mating: each genotype preferentially mates with other morphs. This is sufficient to maintain the system despite the fact that in this case the heterozygote has slightly lower viability. Another example is the genetic polyrmorphism of larval developmental rates seen in the Phengaris rebeli, in which there exist slow-developing larvae (SDL) (75% of the total P. rebeli larval population) and fast-developing larvae (FDL) (25% of the total P. rebeli larvae population). The slow-developing larvae do not grow much during the first year, but grow rapidly during {{the early part of the}} second summer and remain a second winter within the ant colonies. On the other hand, the FDL complete their growth the following spring after they are taken into the ant nest.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{recurring}} arguments in evolutionary biology is whether evolution occurs principally through natural selection or through neutral {{processes such as}} genetic drift. A 60 -year-long time series {{of changes in the}} genotype frequency of a colour polymorphism of the <b>scarlet</b> <b>tiger</b> moth, Callimorpha dominula, was used to compare the relative effects of genetic drift and variable natural selection. The analysis showed that most of the variation in frequency was the result of genetic drift. In addition, although selection was acting, mean fitness barely increased. This supports the ‘Red Queen’s hypothesis’ that long-term improvements in fitness may not occur, because populations have to keep pace with changes in the environment...|$|E
40|$|Defensive fluids {{obtained}} from the Garden Tiger, <b>Scarlet</b> <b>Tiger</b> and Burnet Moths and from the Monarch Butterfly and the Seven-Spot Ladybird Beetle, haemolymphs taken from the wasp, the Burying Beetle and the Rat Flea, and fluids from the eggs of the Garden Tiger, Gypsy Moth and Oak Eggar Moth were examined in the electron microscope after negative staining. Except for the ladybird all the defensive fluids, haemolymphs and egg fluids contained particles 100 - 150 A across which frequently had rectangular or square outlines. In some species the particles were occasionally arranged in groups of 2 and 4 and in the egg fluid of the Garden Tiger they were arranged in rows which were aligned side by side to form strands of considerable length. The particles {{are believed to be}} protein. They correspond in size to the 16 s component of the haemocyanin 8 of Limulus and Homarus and the protein particles found in Calliphora by other workers...|$|E
