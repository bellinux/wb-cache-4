5|$|Captivated by Hedren's Nordic looks, Hitchcock becomes {{infatuated}} with her. While filming The Birds, he makes physical advances {{to her in}} the back of a limousine but she rebuffs him and escapes through the back door. In retaliation for her rejection, Hitchcock exposes Hedren to terrifying encounters with birds. A mechanical bird breaks the apparently <b>shatterproof</b> glass of a telephone booth during filming, scratching Hedren's face with splintering glass. After arriving on set to shoot a scene where Hedren's character (Melanie Daniels) is trapped in an attic with aggressive birds, she discovers that Hitchcock has ordered the mechanical birds to be replaced with live ones. He demands the scene be repeated until he is satisfied that Hedren's reaction looks authentic. This takes a protracted several days of filming, leaving Hedren traumatised.|$|E
5|$|In general appearance, {{the current}} {{operating}} line of SIR looks somewhat like an outdoor {{line of the}} New York City Subway. Since the 1960s, it has been grade separated from all roads, but it runs more or less at street level for a brief stretch north of Clifton, between the Grasmere and Old Town stations, and from south of the Pleasant Plains station to Tottenville, {{the end of the}} line. It uses NYC Transit-standard 600 V DC third rail power. Its equipment are R44 subway type cars that are specially modified with headlight dimmers, electric windshield defrosters, FRA Compliant cab signals and horns, and FRA regulation 223 required <b>shatterproof</b> glazing, and exterior mounted grab rails near the side doors. The cars were built in early 1973, {{at the tail end of}} the R44 order of subway cars for New York City Transit (the Staten Island R44s being the last cars built by the St. Louis Car Company). Heavy maintenance of the equipment is performed at NYCT's Clifton Shops. Any work that cannot be performed at Clifton requires the cars to be trucked over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the subway's Coney Island Complex shops in Brooklyn. The right-of-way also includes elevated, embankment and open-cut portions, and a tunnel near St. George.|$|E

25|$|Silicone: Silicone {{bakeware}} is light, {{flexible and}} able to withstand sustained temperatures of 360°C (675°F). It melts around 500°C (930°F), depending upon the fillers used. Its flexibility is advantageous in removing baked goods from the pan. This rubbery material should {{not to be confused}} with the silicone resin used to make hard, <b>shatterproof</b> children's dishware, which is not suitable for baking.|$|E
25|$|White fuming {{nitric acid}}, pure nitric acid or WFNA, {{is very close}} to {{anhydrous}} nitric acid. It is available as 99.9% nitric acid by assay. One specification for white fuming nitric acid is that it has a maximum of 2% water and a maximum of 0.5% dissolved NO2. Anhydrous nitric acid has a density of 1.513g/cm3 and has the approximate concentration of 24 molar. Anhydrous nitric acid is a colorless mobile liquid with a density of 1.512g/cm3, which solidifies at −42°C to form white crystals. As it decomposes to NO2 and water, it obtains a yellow tint. It boils at 83°C. It is usually stored in a glass <b>shatterproof</b> amber bottle with twice the volume of head space to allow for pressure build up, but even with those precautions the bottle must be vented monthly to release pressure.|$|E
25|$|The UV {{intensity}} is specified for each lamp {{at a distance}} of 1 meter. UV {{intensity is}} inversely proportional to the square of the distance so it decreases at longer distances. Alternatively, it rapidly increases at distances shorter than 1m. In the above formula the UV intensity must always be adjusted for distance unless the UV dose is calculated at exactly 1m from the lamp. Also, to ensure effectiveness the UV dose must be calculated at the end of lamp life (EOL is specified in number of hours when the lamp is expected to reach 80% of its initial UV output) and at the furthest distance from the lamp {{on the periphery of the}} target area. In some applications coating is applied to the lamp to make it <b>shatterproof.</b> The coating is Fluoro Ethylene Polymer which completely encapsulates the lamp and contains the shards and mercury in case of accidental breakage. The coating decreases the UV intensity up to 20%.|$|E
500|$|Four {{pairs of}} [...] wide {{observation}} windows are provided, spaced [...] apart, inner stone edge to edge, all {{just above the}} lowest course of slabs (504-foot level). Six are [...] high while two on the east face are [...] high for easier egress. All were originally provided with thin marble shutters in a bronze frame each {{of which could be}} opened inward, one left and the other right per wall. After two people committed suicide by jumping through the open windows in the 1920s, hinged horizontal iron bars were added to them in 1929. A ninth opening in a slab on the south face just below the capstone is provided for access to the outside of the pyramidion. It is covered by a stone slab which is internally removable. In 1931, four red aircraft warning lights were installed, one per face in one of its observation windows. Pilots complained that they could not be easily seen, so the monument was floodlit on all sides as well. In 1958, eight [...] diameter holes for new red aircraft warning lights were bored, one above each window near the top edge of the fourth course of slabs (516-foot level) in the pyramidion. In 1958 the observation windows were glazed with <b>shatterproof</b> glass. In 1974–76, they were glazed with bulletproof glass and the shutters removed. New bulletproof glass was installed during 1997–2000.|$|E

2500|$|The racquetball {{court is}} {{reminiscent}} of an old country club, furnished in dark leather and a functional bar. There is a sunken sitting area with the ever-present stereo system found throughout Graceland, {{as well as the}} dark brown upright piano upon which Elvis played for what were to be his last songs, Willie Nelson's [...] "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain" [...] and The Righteous Brothers' [...] "Unchained Melody". Reports conflict about which one was the last song. The sitting area has a floor-to-ceiling <b>shatterproof</b> window designed to watch the many racquetball games that took place here when Elvis was alive. In {{the early hours of the}} morning Elvis died he, his girlfriend Ginger Alden, his first cousin Billy Smith and Billy's wife Jo played a game of racquetball ending the game with the song on the piano before Elvis walked into the main house to wash his hair and go to bed. Today the two story court has been restored to the way it was when Elvis used the building.|$|E
5000|$|Contreras {{explains}} that American Securit Co. v. <b>Shatterproof</b> Glass Corp. is a notable case {{because it is}} the first decision to address the consequences of a patent holder’s violation of the terms of a court-imposed compulsory patent licensing decree. In 1948, a district court entered a consent decree establishing that Securit and other glass-manufacturer defendants violated the Sherman Act by conspiring to exploit patents covering technology for tempering flat glass panes in a restrictive manner. The defendants were ordered to grant to any applicant a non-exclusive license under their patents and to refrain from including any restrictions or conditions in that license. The consent decree included a prohibition against requiring a licensee to take a license under any patent not covered by the decree. <b>Shatterproof</b> Glass requested a license from Securit in 1951 for a license under some patents covered in the consent decree. Securit refused to grant <b>Shatterproof</b> a license unless it agreed to license a larger portfolio of patents that included patents not covered in the decree, at a single, fixed royalty rate—a so-called package license. After inconclusive negotiations, <b>Shatterproof</b> began to manufacture glass in a manner allegedly covered by Securit’s patents. Securit then sued <b>Shatterproof</b> for patent infringement. <b>Shatterproof</b> raised as defenses patent misuse and Securit's violation of the consent order, which expressly prohibited Securit's package-licensing demand. The district court in Delaware ruled for <b>Shatterproof</b> on both grounds and barred Securit from enforcing its patents against <b>Shatterproof,</b> and the Third Circuit affirmed. Securit argued to the district court that the package license was its standard form of license and deviating from that standard offering would discriminate against Securit’s existing licensees. The district court rejected the argument, saying that obey the consent decree. Contreras states that this is [...] "the first example of patents being rendered unenforceable {{as a result of the}} violation of a court-imposed patent licensing commitment." ...|$|E
