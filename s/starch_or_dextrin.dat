Its characteristics of environmental friendly, highly selectivity and availability helps a lot in its application either in food or mining industries. The common digestion methods in flotation of polysaccharides, such as <b>starch</b> <b>or</b> <b>dextrin,</b> include thermal treatment at different temperatures or alkali-digestion at different concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Bile acid {{sequestrants}} (BAS) {{represent a}} therapeutic approach {{for the management}} of hypercholesterolemia that relies on the cationic polymeric nature of BAS to selectively bind negatively charged bile acids. We hypothesized that the cross-linking of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) and saccharides such as <b>starch</b> <b>or</b> <b>dextrin</b> with divinyl sulfone (DVS) yields homo- and hetero-polymeric materials with the ability to trap sterols. Our hypothesis was put to test by synthesizing a library of 22 polymers that were screened to evaluate their capability to sequester both cholesterol (CHOL) and cholic and deoxycholic acids (CA and DCA). Three polymers synthesized in high yield were identified as promising. Two were neutral hetero-polymers of β-CD and <b>starch</b> <b>or</b> <b>dextrin</b> and the third was a weakly cationic homo-polymer of starch, highlighting the importance of the cavity effect. They were tested in hypercholesterolemic male Wistar rats and their ability to regulate hypercholesterolemia was similar to that for the reference BAS cholestyramine, but with two additional advantages: (i) they normalized the TG level and (ii) they did not increase the creatinine level. Neither hepatotoxicity nor kidney injury was detected, further supporting them as therapeutical candidates to manage hypercholesterolemia...|$|E
40|$|Alcoholic fermentation, growth, and {{glucoamylase}} {{production by}} 12 strains of Saccharomyces diastaticus were compared by using starch and dextrins as substrates. Haploid progeny produced from a rapidly fermenting strain, SD 2, {{were used for}} hybridization with other S. diastaticus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae haploids. Alcoholic fermentation and enzyme production by hybrid diploids and their haploid parents were evaluated. Although the dosage of the STA or DEX (<b>starch</b> <b>or</b> <b>dextrin</b> fermentation) genes may enhance ethanol production, epistatic effects in certain strain combinations caused decreases in starch-fermenting activity. Both {{the nature of the}} <b>starch</b> <b>or</b> <b>dextrin</b> used and the fermentation medium pH had substantial effects on alcohol production. Commercial dextrin was not as good a substrate as dextrins prepared by digesting starch with α-amylase. Crude manioc starch digested by α-amylase was fermented directly by selected hybrids with almost 100 % conversion efficiency. The manioc preparation contained adequate minerals and growth factors. This procedure should be suitable for direct commercial application in manioc-producing regions in Brazil and elsewhere. A rapidly fermenting haploid strain, SD 2 -A 8, descended from strain SD 2, contains two unlinked genes controlling formation of extracellular amylase. A convenient method for detecting these genes (STA genes) in replica plates containing large numbers of meiotic progeny was developed...|$|E
25|$|Dextrins are a {{group of}} low-molecular-weight {{carbohydrates}} produced by the hydrolysis of <b>starch</b> <b>or</b> glycogen. <b>Dextrins</b> are mixtures of polymers of D-glucose units linked by α-(1→4) or α-(1→6) glycosidic bonds.|$|R
40|$|The gene {{encoding}} the {{branching enzyme}} (BE) from the thermoalkaliphilic, anaerobic bacterium Anaerobranca gottschalkii was fused with a twin arginine translocation protein secretory-pathway-dependent signal sequence from Escherichia coli and expressed in Staphylococcus carnosus. The secreted BE was purified using hydrophobic interaction and gel filtration chromatography. The monomeric enzyme (72 kDa) shows maximal activity at 50 degrees C and pH 7. 0. With amylose the BE displays high transglycosylation and extremely low hydrolytic activity. The conversion of amylose and linear dextrins was analysed by applying high-performance anion exchange chromatography and quantitative size-exclusion chromatography. Amylose (10 (4) - 4 x 10 (7) g/mol) was {{converted to a}} major extent to products displaying molecular masses of 10 (4) - 4 x 10 (5) g/mol, indicating that the enzyme could be applicable {{for the production of}} <b>starch</b> <b>or</b> <b>dextrins</b> with narrow molecular mass distributions. The majority of the transferred oligosaccharides, determined after enzymatic hydrolysis of the newly synthesized alpha- 1, 6 linkages, ranged between 10 (3) and 10 (4) g/mol, which corresponds to a degree of polymerisation (DP) of 6 - 60. The minimal donor chain length is DP 16. Furthermore, the obtained results support the hypotheses of a random endocleavage mechanism of BE and the occurrence of interchain branching...|$|R
40|$|Pea (Pisum sativum L.) tissues {{with reduced}} {{chloroplast}} density (e. g. petals and stems) or function (i. e. senescent leaves and leaves darkened for prolonged periods) were surveyed {{to determine whether}} tissues with genetically or environmentally reduced chloroplast density and/or function also have significantly different amylolytic enzyme activities and/or isoform patterns than leaf tissues with totally competent chloroplasts. Native PAGE followed by electrophoretically blotting through a <b>starch</b> <b>or</b> β-limit <b>dextrin</b> containing gel and KI/I 2 staining revealed that the primary amylases in leaves, stems, petals, and roots were the primarily vacuolar β-amylase (EC 3. 2. 1. 2) and the primarily apoplastic α-amylase (EC 3. 2. 1. 1). Among tissues of light grown pea plants, petals contained {{the highest levels of}} total amylolytic (primarily β-amylase) activity and considerably higher ratios of β- to α-amylase. In aerial tissues there was an inverse relationship between chlorophyll and starch concentration, and β-amylase activity. In sections of petals and stems there was a pronounced inverse relationship between chlorophyll concentration and the activity of α-amylase. Senescing leaves of pea, as determined by age, and protein and chlorophyll content, contained 3. 8 -fold (fresh weight basis) and 32 -fold (protein basis) higher α-amylase activity than fully mature leaves. Leaves maintained in darkness for 12 days displayed a 14 -fold (fresh weight basis) increase in α-amylase activity over those grown under continuous light. In senescence and prolonged darkness studies, the α-amylase that was greatly increased in activity was the primarily apoplastic α-amylase. These studies indicate that there is a pronounced inverse relationship between chloroplast function and levels of apoplastic α-amylase activity and in some cases an inverse relationship between chloroplast density and/or function and vacuolar β-amylase activity...|$|R
40|$|Maximum {{production}} of the alpha toxin by Cl. welchii {{is dependent on the}} inclusion in the medium of several substances in addition to those required for growth. These factors include: 1. Some substance present in enzymatic digests of certain proteins such as casein and gelatine. 2. Glycerylphosphorylcholine and other substances that are present in extracts of pancreas. 3. The use of <b>starch</b> <b>or</b> <b>dextrin</b> as a carbohydrate source in the absence of other fermentable carbohydrates. The omission of any one of these factors from the medium results in a very low yield of alpha toxin...|$|E
40|$|Glucose infused {{into the}} abomasum of Holstein steers {{resulted}} in higher arterial glucose concentrations and increased net glucose absorption than either <b>starch</b> <b>or</b> <b>dextrin</b> infusions. Increasing infusion rates above 20 g/hr for both starch and dextrin {{resulted in no further}} increases in net glucose absorption. Even though the enzymatic starch and dextrin hydrolysis became saturated above 25 g/hr, {{the amount of}} starch and dextrin disappearing in the small intestine increased with higher infusion rates. This was accompanied by increased volatile fatty acid concentrations in the ileal fluid with starch and dextrin infusions, but not when glucose was infused. These data support two concepts: (l) microbial fermentation is involved in small-intestinal starch disappearance and (2) starch and dextrin hydrolysis in the small intestine of steers is more rate limiting than glucose absorptive capacity...|$|E
40|$|Becker et al. (1954 a) {{have shown}} that newborn pigs can neither hydrolyze su-crose nor can they utilize fructose. How-ever, early in life piglets develop the ca-pacity to utilize sucrose (Becker et al., 1954 b) and, {{according}} to Kidder et al. (1963), at an age of 17 days {{they appear to have}} the ability to completely hy-drolyze sucrose. Mitchell et al. (1937) ob-served a slight impairment in the digesti-bility of organic nutrients in a sucrose ration for rats, as compared with a ration containing glucose, and a slower rate of growth and of protein deposition on a fructose-containing ration. In the same species, Ruttloff and Ketz (1961) ob-served a decreased absorption rate for fructose as compared with glucose. In the chicken, the protein level has been shown to play a role in the compara-tive utilization of carbohydrates, sucrose diets promoting a growth rate equivalent to that obtained with dextrin diets on high- but not low-protein levels (Monson et al, 1954). Chalupa and Fisher (1963) found that on a low-protein diet (13 %) a mixture of glucose, starch, and dextrin promoted better growth than any single carbohydrate; when using a single carbo-hydrate, they obtained better results with sucrose alone than with <b>starch</b> <b>or</b> <b>dextrin...</b>|$|E
50|$|British gum <b>or</b> <b>dextrin</b> is {{prepared}} by heating starch. It varies considerably in composition, sometimes being only slightly roasted and consequently only partly converted into dextrine, {{and at other}} times being highly torrefied, and almost completely soluble in cold water and very dark in colour. Its thickening power decreases and its gummy nature increases as the temperature at which it is roasted is raised. It is useful for strongly acid colours, and with the exception of gum Senegal, it is the best choice for strongly alkaline colours and discharges. Like the natural gums, it does not penetrate as well into the fibre of the cloth pr as deeply as pure <b>starch</b> <b>or</b> flour and is unsuitable for very dark, strong colours.|$|R

40|$|The absorption, disposition, metabolism, and {{excretion}} of 14 C-labeled γ-cyclodextrin ([14 C]γ-CD) {{was examined}} in four separate experiments with Wistar rats. In experiment 1, [14 C]γ-CD (25 μCi, 600 mg/kg body wt) was administered intravenously to four male and four female conventional rats. In experiment 2, [14 C]γ- CD (25 μCi, 1000 mg/kg body wt) {{was given by}} gavage to four male and four female germ-free rats. In experiments 3 and 4, [14 C]γ-CD (25 and 100 μCi, respectively, 1000 mg/kg body wt) was given to four male and four female conventional rats by gavage. In all experiments, 14 C was measured in respiratory CO 2, urine, feces contents of the gastrointestinal tract, blood, main organs, and residual carcass. The chemical identity of the 14 C-labeled compounds was examined by HPLC in urine (experiments 1 - 4), blood (experiments 1 and 4), and samples of intestinal contents (experiments 3 and 4). Recovered 14 C was expressed {{as a percentage of}} the administered dose. Total recovery of 14 C varied between about 90 % (experiments 3 and 4) and 100 % (experiments 1 and 2). Experiment 1 showed that about 90 % of intravenously administered γ-CD is excreted in urine within 24 h. During the first 2 h after dosing, plasma 14 C levels decreased rapidly (t(1 / 4), 15 - 20 min). The remaining 10 % of the dose was probably excreted into the gastrointestinal tract with bile and saliva. In addition, some [14 C]γ-CD may have been degraded by plasma and tissue amylases. Since glucose is the common product of systemic hydrolysis and intestinal digestion, it is not possible to quantitate the relative flux of [14 C]γ-CD through these two pathways. Upon oral administration of [14 C]γ-CD to germ-free rats (experiment 2), about 66 % of the label was expired as CO 2 within 24 h. The rate of 14 C exhalation reached a maximum at 90 min after dosing and then declined steadily. In the urine, and in the contents of the cecum and colon collected at 24 h, [14 C]γ-CD was not found (except for a trace in the cecum of females). In conventional rats (experiments 3 and 4), a similar, fast appearance of respiratory 14 CO 2, was observed. There was no delayed formation of 14 CO 2 due to incomplete digestion and subsequent microbial fermentation in the cecum and colon. In pooled urine collected at 4 h after dosing, a small amount of unchanged [14 C]γ-CD was detected (experiment 4). From this result, it was estimated that less than 0. 02 % of ingested intact γ-CD was absorbed and excreted with the urine. It is concluded from the data that ingested [14 C]γ-CD is rapidly and essentially completely digested in the small intestine to absorbable [14 C]glucose. The absorption of intact [14 C]γ-CD by passive diffusion is very low (< 0. 02 %). Therefore, the metabolism of γ-CD resembles closely that of <b>starch</b> <b>or</b> linear <b>dextrins...</b>|$|R
40|$|Holstein steers (775 lbs) were surgically {{fitted with}} abomasal and ileal cannulae, portal and {{mesenteric}} venous catheters, and an elevated carotid artery. These steers {{were used to}} study starch digestion in the small intestine. Glucose, corn starch, and corn dextrin were infused into the abomasum at various levels and ileal digesta samples were collected. Disappearance of carbohydrate (CHO) in the small intestine was determined using Cr:EDTA as an indigestible marker. Blood samples were collected from the portal vein and carotid artery during carbohydrate infusion. Blood flow was determined, and net glucose absorption across the small intestine was calculated. Glucose infusions resulted in higher arterial glucose concentrations and increased net glucose absorption than either <b>starch</b> <b>or</b> <b>dextrin</b> infusions. Increasing infusion rates above 20 g/h for both starch and dextrin {{resulted in no further}} increases in net glucose absorption. Even though the enzymatic processes for starch and dextrin hydrolysis became saturated at a low infusion rate, the amount of starch and dextrin disappearing in the small intestine increased with higher infusion rates. This was accompanied by an increased volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration in the ileal fluid with starch and dextrin infusions, but not when glucose was infused. Data from these experiments support two concepts: (1) microbial fermentation is involved in small-intestinal starch appearance and (2) starch and dextrin hydrolysis in the small intestine of steers is more rate limiting than glucose absorptive capacity...|$|E
40|$|During {{studies of}} {{nutritional}} effects on tuberculous mortality in NCS mice a consistent deviation {{was found in}} the frequency distribution of death. This was due almost entirely to the fact {{that a large number of}} animals responded to the infection in a hyperacute manner. Since a knowledge of this response would appear to be important to the understanding of mechanisms of resistance to tuberculosis, a report of our findings is given below. Materials and Methods Animuls. [...] The new NCS colony of mice maintained at The Rockefeller Institute has been described elsewhere (1 - 6). Female mice were used in the majority of experiments, although occasional groups of male mice were included. All animals were obtained at 4 to 6 weeks of age, and were distributed at random in groups of three to twenty animals. The size of cage was selected to insure that crowding did not occur. The litter of wood shavings was changed weekly. D/ets. [...] Animals were maintained on one of several nutritional regimens. Unless otherwise noted, they were given commercial D & G pellets (Dietrich and Gambrill, Frederick, Maryland). In other experiments animals were fed commercial Rockland mouse pellets (A. E. Staley Manufacturing Co., Decatur, Illinois) or semisynthetic rations containing 15 or 20 per cent vitamin-free casein, 4 per cent Wesson salt mixture, 10 per cent aiphacel, 0. 4 per cent vitamin fortification mixture, 0. 1 per cent cystine, 5 per cent fat (peanut or corn oil), and <b>starch</b> <b>or</b> <b>dextrin</b> to 100 per cent. The several semisynthetic diets used differed slightly, as indicated, but these differences were without effect on the results.
