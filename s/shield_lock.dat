50|$|Along {{with the}} rise of the {{city-state}} evolved a new style of warfare: the hoplite phalanx. Hoplites were armored infantryman, armed with spear and shield, and the phalanx was a formation of these soldiers with their <b>shields</b> <b>locked</b> together and spears pointed forward. The Chigi vase, dated to around 650 BC, is the earliest depiction of a hoplite in full battle array. With this evolution in warfare, battles seem to have consisted mostly of the clash of hoplite phalanxes from the city-states in conflict. Since the soldiers were citizens with other occupations, warfare was limited in distance, season and scale. Neither side could afford heavy casualties or sustained campaigns, so conflicts seem to have been resolved by a single set-piece battle.|$|R
60|$|Sempronius {{brought up}} his second line {{to fill the}} {{intervals}} in the first, and the Romans advanced with equal steadiness to the conflict; but the much greater closeness of the Carthaginian formation served them in good stead. They moved like a solid wall, their <b>shields</b> <b>locked</b> closely together, and pressed steadily forward {{in spite of the}} desperate efforts of the Roman centre in its more open order to resist them; for each Roman soldier in battle was allowed the space of a man's width between him and his comrade on either side, to allow him the free use of his weapon. Two Carthaginians were therefore opposed to each Roman, in addition to which the greater depth of the African formation gave them a weight and impetus which was irresistible.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{study is}} an {{analysis}} and {{a comparison of}} traditional furniture styles in China and Korea in terms of size, style of leg, and metal mounts. The {{study was limited to}} the household wardrobes, cabinets, and chests of both countries from the fifteenth to the early twentieth century. A total of 141 examples (65 examples of Chinese furniture, 76 of Korean) included illustrations from publications and actual pieces from the Portland Art Museum and six antique shops in Oregon and California. A work sheet was developed to record observations of the sample. For statistical analysis the binomial probabilities table, contingency table analysis, and t-test were used; level of significance was established at 0. 05. All Chinese wardrobes and 82. 2 percent of the cabinets had straight legs. Chinese chests had either legs of horse's hoof style or no legs. The most frequent motif of Chinese hinges and <b>lock</b> <b>shields</b> was the square, and the most frequent motif of the pulls was the leaf. Chinese circle <b>lock</b> <b>shields</b> tended to appear with circle hinges, and square <b>lock</b> <b>shields</b> with square hinges. More than half of Korean wardrobes had horse's hoof legs. Of Korean cabinets, 66. 7 percent had straight legs and 64. 7 percent of chests did not have legs. The square motif appeared most often on Korean hinges and <b>lock</b> <b>shields.</b> The most frequent motif of Korean pulls was the circle. Whereas Korean circle <b>lock</b> <b>shields</b> tended to appear with circle hinges, Korean square <b>lock</b> <b>shields</b> did not tend to have square hinges. The overall features of Chinese furniture in this study were quite different from Korean. Even though both Chinese and Korean furniture were simple and straight in structure, Chinese furniture was simpler. Usually a piece of Korean wardrobe or cabinet consisted of several stories, and the front was symmetrically divided into many rectangular panels and drawers. Chinese wardrobes were significantly larger than Korean in height, width, and depth; the width and depth of Chinese cabinets were significantly larger than those of Korean. Chinese chests, however, were significantly smaller than Korean in height and width. For both Chinese and Korean furniture, wood grains served as an important-decorative element; but the wood grains on Korean furniture were more distinct and arranged more variedly. Usually, on a piece of Korean furniture the designs of wood grains were symmetrically arranged; vertical and horizontal grains were combined. Metal mounts were used as decorative as well as functional elements for the furniture of both countries, but Korean furniture had more kinds and amounts of metal mounts than Chinese. Even though each country had its preferred motifs and its own motifs on metal mounts, the majority of both Chinese and Korean metal mounts were of geometric motifs...|$|R

Cindy of Earth-65 almost had a similar spider bite accident to the main one, but a teacher swatted it with a newspaper. Dissatisfied with her life, she joins S.H.I.E.L.D. as a researcher in spiders. There was a spider-related incident in which Jesse Drew was nearly killed, but Cindy's research saves his life and gives him spider powers, with Agent Drew making it up to Cindy by becoming one of her top agents. She eventually recovers the altered spider back from S.H.I.E.L.D. with Jesse's help and releases it into the open, where it bit Gwen Stacy and led to her becoming Earth-65's Spider-Woman. During the Spider-Women event, Jesse steals Gwen's interdimensional teleporter and travels to Earth-616, where she steals a large amount of technology while framing her 616 counterpart. When she encounters Gwen and her counterpart, she uses her technology to take away Gwen's powers. When she returns to her hideout after Jesse's betrayal, she is ambushed by Jessica Drew, Gwen, and her counterpart and is defeated. <b>S.H.I.E.L.D.</b> <b>locks</b> her up for her crimes and her counterpart teases her by sending her a care package with all the things she had in her bunker.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} Roman and Byzantine armies, similar {{formations}} of <b>locked</b> <b>shields</b> and projecting spears were called fulcum (φοῦλκον, phoulkon in Greek), and were first {{described in the}} late 6th-century Strategikon. Roman legions were typically well-trained, and often used short stabbing-swords (such as the Gladius) in the close-quarters combat that inevitably resulted when their shield-walls contacted the enemy. As Auxiliaries were often less well-armed, a shield-wall with spearmen was commonly used to provide a better defence.|$|R

It depicts two groups of warriors locked in battle: on the one side are jaguar warriors, armed with spears, obsidian knives, and round <b>shields,</b> who are <b>locked</b> in battle with an army of bird warriors (some of whom are shown naked and in various stages of dismemberment).|$|R
2500|$|This delay {{had allowed}} {{the bulk of}} the Norse army to form a shieldwall to face the English attack. Harold's army poured across the bridge, forming a line just short of the Norse army, <b>locked</b> <b>shields</b> and charged. The battle went far beyond the bridge itself, and {{although}} it raged for hours the Norse army's decision to leave their armour behind left them at a distinct disadvantage. Eventually, the Norse army began to fragment and fracture, allowing the English troops to force their way in and break up the Scandinavians' shield wall.

60|$|The Mandayas {{are forced}} to seek a refuge from would-be baganis by {{perching}} {{on the tops of}} trees like birds, but their aerial abodes do not always shelter them from their enemies. They build a hut on a trunk from forty to fifty feet in height, and huddle together in it to pass the night, and to be in sufficient numbers to repulse their assailants. The baganis generally try to take their victims by surprise, and begin their attack with burning arrows, with which they endeavour to set on fire the bamboo roof. Sometimes the besiegers form a testudo, like the ancient Romans, with their <b>locked</b> <b>shields,</b> and advance under cover up to the posts, which they attack with their axes, while the besieged hurl down showers of stones upon their heads. But, once their ammunition is exhausted, the hapless Mandayas have nothing to do but witness, as impotent spectators, the work of destruction, until the moment comes when their habitation topples over and falls. Then the captives are divided among the assailants. The heads of the old men and of the wounded are cut off, and the women and children are led away as slaves.|$|R
5000|$|The phalanx depth could vary {{depending}} on the needs of the moment and plans of the general. While the phalanx was in march, an eis bathos formation (loose, meaning literally [...] "in depth") was adopted in order to move more freely and maintain order. This was also the initial battle formation as, in addition, it permitted friendly units to pass through whether assaulting or retreating. In this status, the phalanx had twice the normal depth and each hoplite had to occupy about 1.8 - 2 m in width. When enemy infantry was approaching, a rapid switch to the pycne (spelled also pucne) formation (dense or tight formation) was necessary. In that case, each man's space was halved (0.9 - 1 m in width) and the formation depth returned to normal. An even denser formation, the synaspismos or sunaspismos (ultra tight or <b>locked</b> <b>shields</b> formation), was used when the phalanx was expected to experience extra pressure, intense missile volleys or frontal cavalry charges. In synaspismos, the rank depth was half that of a normal phalanx and the width each man occupied was as small as 0.45 m.|$|R
