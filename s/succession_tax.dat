50|$|According to the Bulgarian {{legislation}} regulating local taxes, <b>succession</b> <b>tax</b> is levied on estate {{succeeded by}} law or by will within Bulgaria or abroad by Bulgarian citizens {{as well as}} on the estate located within Bulgaria succeeded by foreign nationals. The succeeded estate includes the movable and immovable property owned by the decedent and the rights over such property, as well as their other property rights, receivables and liabilities at the time of opening of the succession, unless otherwise provided by legislative statute. The inherited estate is subject to deductions as to the obligations and tax reliefs laid down in Bulgarian law, or in those cases where it is inherited by the state.Art. 38 lists the types of property that are tax free:• property passed to the State or municipalities;• ordinary household furnishings;• pensions not received by the decedent;• estate of Bulgarian citizens located abroad to which the <b>succession</b> <b>tax</b> of the respective state has applied.Taxable persons are:• heirs by law, such that as of 2004, <b>succession</b> <b>tax</b> in Bulgaria does not apply to the surviving spouse and the lineal heirs;• testamentary heirs, beneficiaries and legatees;• stateless persons are subject to the <b>succession</b> <b>tax</b> for inherited estate on the territory of Bulgaria, if the person in question has been permanently resident within the territory of Bulgaria (Art. 29 LTFA).The heirs may waive the succession through a unilateral act and as a result, they are subject to the <b>succession</b> <b>tax.</b> The waiver needs to be express, written and recorded in a specific book at the District Court. In case there is more than one heir, the tax is due in accordance with their share, and the taxable amount depends on the degree of kinship and the size of the inherited share. The tax is determined and communicated to each co-heir - Art. 106 and Art. 107 TIPC.|$|E

40|$|As a main {{principle}}, {{income is}} taxed when earned. This principle is broken {{in case of}} unrealized capital gains (recovered depreciations, unrecorded intangible assets etc.). Such incomes are taxed when realized or the ‘latent tax’ is {{passed on to the}} new owner (<b>tax</b> <b>succession).</b> In Denmark, <b>tax</b> <b>succession</b> is allowed only if the new owner is a close relative to the previous owner. However, recently it has been proposed to extend the access to <b>tax</b> <b>succession</b> to a wider group of potential purchasers as a means of facilitating generational chances in small and medium sized firms. One argument is that taxation of capital gains gives the previous owner an incentive to delay the generational change longer than appropriate from an efficiency point of view (the ‘lock-in’ effect). Sections 2 and 3 analyse, within a very simple framework, the impact of <b>tax</b> <b>succession</b> on the price of a firm, the after-tax revenue to the previous owner, and the tax proceeds. The conclusion is that <b>tax</b> <b>succession</b> has significant effects on before-tax and after-tax prices and that the associated indirect tax subsidy is an appreciable expenditure. Sections 4 and 5 address the problem of efficiency losses from <b>tax</b> <b>succession</b> and ‘lock-in. The conclusion is that, most probably, the former efficiency loss out-weighs the latter one, in particular, if the rules are discriminatory giving the previous owner an incentive to choose a less efficient purchaser who are allowed to succeed rather than a more efficient one who is not.

40|$|Under Belgian {{constitutional}} law, <b>succession</b> <b>tax</b> {{and registration}} tax are regional taxes. For the Flemish government, the legislative competence {{in this field}} seems an important instrument for policy making. In an attempt to sustain familial entrepreneurship as a valuable element in our society's economic texture, the inheritance of a family-owned company is exempted from the <b>Succession</b> <b>Tax</b> (art. 60 bis <b>Succession</b> <b>Tax</b> Code for the Flemish Region). It is useful to analyse this measure. More precisely, {{it is interesting to}} figure out the material conditions for the aforementioned exemption and policy-goals that inspired to them. Questions to be dealt with are the characteristics of a family-owned company - how must the company be organised; minimum control/participation of the deceased's family - and the minimum standards the company must fulfil in terms of - ongoing - employment. For transfer by death, an exemption exists; while for the gift of a company inters vivo, a reduced tax rate is applied (art. 140 bis-octies Registration Tax Code for the Flemish Region). The conditions for this reduction need to be analysed, as well as the differences with the conditions for the exemption of art. 60 bis <b>Succession</b> <b>Tax</b> Code for the Flemish Region shall be commented. It has to be clear why the reduction of the percentage of the Registration Tax is not reserved to family-owned companies and why {{it does not seem to}} be subject to an employment condition, but only to keep the company ongoing during a period of five years. Lastly, the Flemish measures to promote entrepreneurship form the viewpoint of <b>Succession</b> <b>tax</b> and Registration tax need to be situated in an international and inter-regional context...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{exploits}} {{a natural}} experiment {{to study the}} effect of succession taxes on firm succession and investment decisions. The experiment is {{made possible by the}} Greek government’s decision to abolish its high tax on intra-family transfers of businesses in 2002. This change in tax policy is used to identify the effect on investment using two methodologies: 1) A difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) methodology, and 2) an instrumental variables (IV) approach, which exploits the gender of the first-born child of the departing entrepreneur as an instrument for family successions. Both the DDD and the IV estimates show that in the presence of high succession taxes firms undergoing an intra-family transfer of ownership experience a more than 40 % drop in investment around succession. High succession taxes are also associated with lower propensity for intra-family succession, slow total asset growth and a depletion of cash reserves (presumably used to pay taxes) for firms experiencing family successions. To identify the mechanism through which taxes affect investment, I collect data on the income of the entrepreneurs from sources other than the firm undergoing succession. I find that the investment effects are much stronger for family firms owned by entrepreneurs with relatively low income from other sources. This suggests that the observed effect of the <b>succession</b> <b>tax</b> on investment is driven by financial constraints...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} hereditary succession {{as a kind}} {{of ownership}} acquisition. Firstly, it deals with the overall nature of ownership, distinct ways of its acquisition, as well as explains the term real property.

Within the framework of inheritance proceedings, the main attention is devoted to a notary acting as a court commissioner. The matters of inheritance procedures with real property being their subjects and issues connected with the subsequent ownership acquisition of such property are discussed separately. The part of the problem also concerns inheritance <b>tax</b> (<b>succession,</b> death duty). The practical part concentrates on two individual examples from legal practice.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploratory}} study undertaken to analyse Irish BMW Dealerships {{and whether they}} plan for <b>succession</b> and the <b>taxes</b> to be paid on the death or retirement of the founder. This study also explores {{the composition of the}} family business and the involvement of family members in the family business to ascertain the extent of generational transition. A substantial body of the literature is reviewed which initially defines succession in family business context. It then specifically highlights the meaning of succession planning and emphasizes the importance of succession planning for businesses. The literature review explores the many merits gained by having a succession planning process in operation within the business. Finally, the problems of succession and the ambivalence towards it are also explored, putting forward explanations as to why family businesses resist succession planning and the multitude of consequences that can arise when the process is ignored. The research methodology involved both quantitative and qualitative collection of data. The quantitative research was conducted using postal questionnaires and follow up emails. The qualitative research focused on one-to-one interviews with a family business specialist and a senior manager of BMW Ireland. The evidence from the analyse of the questionnaires suggests that the majority of Irish BMW Dealer Principals do plan for succession, however some of the respondents were of the belief that is was too early to plan for succession since they were still quite young. There was a general agreement amongst all the Dealerships that it was advisable to consult external professionals concerning succession and taxation planning. The findings also suggest that many of the Dealer Principals are making provisions for the taxes to be paid on death or retirement and thus availing of the numerous tax concessions available...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Taking company {{succession}} as {{an alternative}} means of embarking on an entrepreneurial activity, {{the aim of this}} study is to explore those intangible assets that are regarded as attractive from the viewpoints of external successors. Thereby, the focal point is on the preparation stage in which promising companies are identified and scrutinised. Design/methodology/approach – The strategy of research behind this paper is the application of a mixed methods approach that is divided into an internet-mediated questionnaire and a series of in depth interviews (given priority). Findings – The findings suggest that intangible assets have a notable influence on the intention of an external successor to take over a company. This would suggest that the traditional issues considered with regard to company <b>succession,</b> such as <b>tax,</b> legal and financial aspects, should be extended to include intangible aspects. The findings are summarized by proposing a framework for the role of intangibles in external succession, thereby highlighting critical intangibles as perceived by external successors. Research limitations/implications – This explorative study is by no means exhaustive; however it is regarded as a valuable fundament for further research activities associated with the role of intangible assets in terms of company succession, particularly external succession. Practical implications – The framework appears to be a valuable tool for understanding the importance of intangibles in external company succession in general and particularly their influence on external successors’ business acquisition intentions. The findings are particularly considered as helpful for incumbent-owners who plan to sell off their companies. Originality/value – The study’s findings can be viewed as a new perspective on company succession as it highlights the intangible assets that make a company attractive to external successors. Given the increasing number of small to medium-sized enterprises waiting to be transferred to new owners, these findings are highly important as they provide a more holistic view of the dynamics of company succession (and external succession in particular).

40|$|The Commission of the European Communities (2006) {{estimates}} in {{its report}} that one third of all EU entrepreneurs will leave within the next ten years. In conjunction with the situation that (1) the majority of Europeans prefer being an employee and (2) the fact that changes in demography will reduce the pool of potential successors over the next decades, this paper argues that external (non-family) successors take on an important role and {{are in a position}} to choose the company, which best matches their expectations. A successful company succession depends on a multitude of different aspects. In the case of external succession, certainly the available funds represent a critical point. However, the assumption is that the decision to acquire a company is based on other factors. It is hypothesised that the potential external successor will be interested in those companies offering potential expansions. In view of the increasing relevance of intangible assets within the firm regarding company success, it is suggested that these assets primarily influence the external successor to go further in the succession process. Thus, it is expected that the future perspectives of the company are founded on its inherent intangibles and which in turn justify a financial investment. The aim of this paper is to explore the role of intangible assets as seen from the viewpoints of external successors. The strategy of research behind this paper is the application of a mixed methods approach which is divided into a survey approach and a case study approach (given priority). Within the quantitative stage a web-survey was used to obtain data on the relevance of intangible assets in terms of external company succession in SMEs whilst addressing members of German trade corporations and chambers of commerce. The results of the quantitative study were enhanced through qualitative interviews with ten external successors in SMEs. The data that were gathered explores the role of intangible assets during the successors’ deliberations as to whether or not the company should be acquired. Intangible assets are found to be important features for external successors. Specifically five intangibles can be highlighted which are brand, partner(s), key-employees, knowledge retention, and corporate culture. The critical intangibles were summarised in a conceptual framework. The findings suggest that in the case of external succession, intangible assets have a remarkable influence on the external successor’s decision-making and traditional issues in the view of company <b>succession</b> such as <b>tax,</b> legal and, financial aspects should be extended to include intangible aspects...|$|R
