40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} study was to evaluate the levels of 14 C and 3 H radionuclides in Hartbeespoort Dam water and to determine if these radionuclides are within regulatory concerns. Water samples from Hartbeespoort Dam were prepared using the <b>Sample</b> <b>Oxidiser</b> Method and measurements of selected radionuclides were done using Liquid Scintillation Counter Quantulus 1220. The results evaluated suggest that water from Hartbeespoort Dam contains levels of 14 C and 3 H radionuclides that are within regulatory limits. The highest average concentration for 14 C measured was 3. 77 E+ 01 (+/- 2. 47 E- 01) Bq/L, whereas the highest average concentration measured for 3 H was 2. 74 E+ 01 (+/- 2. 30 E- 01) Bq/L. The observations made regarding the impacts of climate on the 14 C radionuclide were that, the concentration levels were higher during winter season when there was a rain than during rainy seasons. Tritium results showed that the climate conditions did not have any significant impacts on the concentration levels. When the concentrations of these radionuclides are above regulatory levels (14 C is 100 Bq/L and 3 H is 10000 Bq/L), their impacts may cause harm to public`s health and the environment. Therefore, Necsa as a nuclear facility owner and National Nuclear Regulator (NNR) as a regulator are responsible for ensuring the public protection from radioactive effluents that contain not just 3 H and 14 C, but any radionuclide which may cause harm to public`s health.
