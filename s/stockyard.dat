In the rear yards of some of houses in Old Arabi, there are remnants of blood traps from the area. When excavation for swimming pools was done, residents found dishes from New Orleans hotels and restaurants whose table scraps were once used to feed animals.|$|E

Mining incorporates a fleet of fifteen Komatsu 830E haul trucks. The ore is processed on site in the plant to produce lump (<31.5mm, >6mm) and fines (<6mm) product. There is a primary Jaw Crusher, two secondary cone crushers, a six bin screening building and a 1.2 Million tonne capacity <b>stockyard.</b> Stockpiled ore is loaded onto rail and then transported to the coast through the Hamersley & Robe River railway, where it is loaded onto ships.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} after the {{founding}} of Omaha, the city's economy grew in cycles. Early success as a transportation hub drew a variety of economic sectors to the downtown area. The early warehousing area was located next to the Missouri River, drawings good from steamboats coming upriver from Kansas City and St. Louis, Missouri, as well as points east. The Union Pacific Railroad has been headquartered in Omaha since its inception, eventually bringing the meatpacking, <b>stockyard,</b> and regional brewing companies to the city. The American Smelting and Refining Company owned a large plant on the Omaha riverfront from 1881 into the 1990s, when the Environmental Protection Agency forced it to close.|$|E

50|$|In 1866, {{cattle in}} Texas were worth only $4 per head, {{compared}} to over $40 per {{head in the}} North and East, because lack of market access during the American Civil War had led to over stock of cattle in Texas. In 1867, Joseph G. McCoy built <b>stockyards</b> in Abilene, Kansas. He encouraged Texas cattlemen to drive their herds to his <b>stockyards.</b> The <b>stockyards</b> shipped 35,000 head that year and became the largest <b>stockyards</b> west of Kansas City, Kansas.|$|R
25|$|The {{population}} grew enough that School 5, now a church, was built at 226-228 North Pearl. Development {{pressure on the}} west end of Clinton Avenue came later in the 1850s when Erastus Corning combined many of the state's railroads into the New York Central. To handle the new road's maintenance needs, he began building a yard north of Clinton Avenue west of Northern Boulevard. The facility also had the largest <b>stockyard</b> east of Chicago. The city expanded its horsecar lines to run further west along the former Schenectady Turnpike, now Central Avenue, in the 1860s. This made possible the development of the blocks at {{the west end of}} the district. Many of the clapboard-sided homes there were filled by German immigrants.|$|E
25|$|At the age {{of sixteen}} Curry joined the circus {{in order to help}} provide for his four {{brothers}} and sisters. His job at the circus was that of the “tough man” who took on all comers from the audience in a fight. He had 65 straight wins without anyone going past one 5 minute round. Then In his twenties, Curry became a policeman in his hometown of Hartford, Connecticut where he put his “tough man” background to good use in the streets, quickly earning him a reputation for toughness. Its been claimed that on one occasion a wild steer bull broke out of the Hartford <b>stockyard</b> and ran wild in the streets. Curry literally grabbed the bull by the horns and managed to wrestle it to the ground, however it is likely this was in fact nothing more than a fictional story created by wrestling promoters in order to give reason to his nickname of “Wild Bull” that stuck with him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

The <b>stockyards</b> are referred to in Carl Sandburg's poem Chicago: [...] "proud to be Hog Butcher, Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat, Player with Railroads and Freight Handler to the Nation." [...] Frank Sinatra mentioned the yards in his 1964 song [...] "My Kind of Town," [...] and the <b>stockyards</b> receive a mention in the opening chapter of Thomas Pynchon's novel Against the Day. The Skip James song [...] "Hard Times Killing floor blues" [...] refers to the nickname of the slaughter part of the <b>stockyards</b> during the great depression in the 1930s. The Yards were a major tourist stop, with visitors such as Rudyard Kipling, Paul Bourget and Sarah Bernhardt.

In 1955 the <b>Stockyards</b> became the biggest livestock distribution center in the United States, {{and almost all of}} the cattle was shipped by truck.|$|R

[...] While only one watchman was killed, a few cattle also perished, but the yards were in business the following Sunday evening.|$|E
500|$|Before {{construction}} of the various private stockyards, tavern owners provided pastures and care for cattle herds waiting to be sold. [...] With the spreading service of railroads, several small stockyards were created {{in and around the}} City of Chicago. In 1848, a <b>stockyard</b> called the Bulls Head Market was opened to the public. [...] The Bulls Head Stock Yards were located at Madison Street and Ogden Avenue. [...] In the years that followed, several small stockyards were scattered throughout the city. [...] Between 1852 and 1865, five (5) railroads were constructed to Chicago. [...] The stockyards that sprang up were usually built along various rail lines of these new railroad companies. Some railroads built their own stockyards in Chicago. [...] The Illinois Central and the Michigan Central railroads combined to build the largest set of pens on the lake shore east of Cottage Grove Avenue from 29th Street to 35th Street. [...] In 1878, the New York Central Railroad managed to buy a controlling interest in the Michigan Central Railroad. [...] In this way, Cornelius Vanderbilt, owner of the New York Central Railroad, got his start in the <b>stockyard</b> business in Chicago.|$|E
500|$|In addition, hedging {{transactions}} by the <b>stockyard</b> companies was pivotal in {{the establishment}} and growth of the Chicago-based commodity exchanges and futures markets. [...] Selling on the futures market allowed the seller to have a guaranteed price at a set time in the future. [...] This was extremely helpful to those sellers who expected their cattle or hogs to come to market with a glut of other cattle or hogs when prices might necessarily be substantially lower than the guaranteed futures price.|$|E

5000|$|Track renewal {{work in the}} Eketahuna station yard {{prompted}} a request {{to dispose of the}} <b>stockyards</b> in 1979 to simplify the new layout.

[...] However, {{with the end of}} the American Civil War, the meat packing industry had started to move westward along with the westward migration of the population of the United States. [...] For the meat packing industry moving west meant coming to Chicago. [...] As early as 1827, Archibauld Clybourn had established himself as a butcher in a log slaughter house on the north branch of the Chicago River and supplied most to the garrison of Fort Dearborn. [...] Other small butchers came later. [...] In 1848, the Bull's Head <b>Stockyard</b> began operations at Madison Street and Ogden Avenue on the West Side of Chicago.
