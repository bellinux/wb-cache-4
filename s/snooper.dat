5|$|On October 14, Japanese {{air forces}} {{attempted}} a reprisal against Task Force 38, but poor weather conditions complicated {{their search for}} the U.S. fleet. Only approximately 25 bombers {{made it to the}} vicinity of Task Group 38.2. VF-18's Combat Air Patrol (CAP), which had been flying above the task group continuously for almost two hours, was vectored to intercept these bombers just outside the task group's picket. They took care of the first formation of twelve bombers that emerged from the clouds. Two recently launched divisions of VF-18 <b>Snooper</b> Anti-Submarine Patrol (SNASP) were also routed to intercept, including one division led by Harris. His division had barely finished grouping up after launch when they sighted a second formation of bombers coming towards the ships. Harris exploded one midair then raked a second, sending it crashing into the sea.|$|E
500|$|The {{heavy cruiser}} [...] and two destroyers {{reinforced}} {{the task force}} on 10 February and Brown rendezvoused with the ANZAC Squadron six days later. Even after emptying Neosho of her oil {{there was not enough}} fuel for the ANZAC Squadron to join Brown's proposed raid on Rabaul and they were forced to remain behind. Brown was reinforced by the heavy cruiser [...] and two destroyers on 17 February and tasked these ships to bombard Rabaul in addition to the attack by Lexingtons aircraft. While still some [...] northeast of Rabaul, the task force was spotted by a Kawanishi H6K [...] "Mavis" [...] flying boat on the morning of 20 February. The <b>snooper</b> was detected by Lexingtons radar and was shot down by Lieutenant Commander Jimmy Thach and his wingman, but not before it radioed its spot report. Another H6K was vectored in to confirm the first aircraft's report, but it was detected and shot down before it could radio its report. Brown's plan had depended on the element of surprise and he canceled the raid, although he decided to proceed toward Rabaul to lure Japanese aircraft into attacking him.|$|E

40|$|Protecting confidential, {{numerical}} data in databases from disclosure {{is an important}} issue both for commercial organizations as well as data-gathering and disseminating organizations (such as the Census Bureau). Prior studies have shown that perturbation methods are effective in protecting such confidential data from <b>snoopers.</b> Perturbation methods have to provide legitimate users with accurate (unbiased) information, and also provide adequate security against disclosure of confidential information to <b>snoopers.</b> For databases described by nonnormal multivariate distributions, existing perturbation methods do not provide unbiased characteristics. In this study, we develop a copula-based perturbation method capable of maintaining the marginal distribution of perturbed attributes to be the same before and after perturbation. In addition, this method also preserves the rank order correlation between the confidential and nonconfidential attributes, thereby maintaining monotonic relationships between attributes. The method proposed in this study provides a high level of protection against inferential disclosure. An investigation of the new perturbation method for simulated databases shows that the method performs effectively. The methodology presented in this study represents a signicant step toward improving the practical applicability of data perturbation methods. database management, data security, data perturbation, privacy and confidentiality, copulas...|$|R
