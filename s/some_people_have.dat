5|$|You {{supported}} a stimulus package in 2009. In fact, {{you said the}} Obama stimulus package was not big enough. As governor, you signed onto a regional cap-and-trade market. You endorsed civil unions for same-sex couples. And you served as President Obama's ambassador to China. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> suggested that maybe you're running for president in the wrong party.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion is {{considered}} moderately dangerous in overdose. For significant overdoses, seizures {{have been reported}} in about a third of all cases; other serious effects include hallucinations, loss of consciousness, and abnormal heart rhythms. When bupropion was one of several kinds of pills taken in an overdose, fever, muscle rigidity, muscle damage, hypertension or hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported. While most people recover, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> died, and before they died suffered multiple uncontrolled seizures and heart attacks.|$|E

Media outlets noted that the photo was overexposed and had poor white balance, causing its colours to be washed out, giving rise to the perception by some that the dress is white and gold rather than its actual colours.|$|E
5|$|Elias Magnus Fries and Christopher Theodor Hök first {{described}} this species as Boletus torosus in 1835, a name {{by which it}} was known for many years. Modern molecular phylogenetics shows {{that it is only}} distantly related to Boletus edulis—the type species of Boletus—and it was duly placed in the new genus Imperator in 2015. Eating raw mushrooms of this species leads to vomiting and diarrhea. Gastrointestinal symptoms have also occurred after eating cooked specimens, though <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> eaten it without ill-effects.|$|E
5|$|Ornamentation {{assumes a}} preeminent role {{in much of}} Sorabji's music. His {{harmonic}} language, which frequently combines tonal and atonal elements, is thus freer than in the music of many other composers and less amenable to analysis. Like many other 20th-century composers, Sorabji displays a fondness for tritone and semitone relationships. The opening gesture of his Fourth Piano Sonata, for example, emphasises these two intervals, and the two long pedal points in its third movement are a tritone apart. However, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> remarked that his music rarely contains the tension that is commonly associated with very dissonant music.|$|E

5|$|The {{reasons for}} {{piercing}} or not piercing are varied. Some people pierce for religious or spiritual reasons, while others pierce for self-expression, for aesthetic value, for sexual pleasure, {{to conform to}} their culture or to rebel against it. Some forms of piercing remain controversial, particularly when applied to youth. The display or placement of piercings have been restricted by schools, employers and religious groups. In spite of the controversy, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> practiced extreme forms of body piercing, with Guinness bestowing World Records on individuals with hundreds and even thousands of permanent and temporary piercings.|$|E
5|$|The {{temperature}} of {{a lightning bolt}} can be five times hotter than {{the surface of the}} sun. Although the lightning is extremely hot, the duration is short and 90% of strike victims survive.

5|$|Decatur House (748 Jackson Place NW) is {{allegedly}} {{haunted by}} the ghost of Stephen Decatur. In 1820, Commodore James Barron challenged Commodore Decatur to a duel over comments Decatur had made regarding Barron's conduct in the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair of 1807. The two men duelled on March 20, and Decatur was mortally wounded in the stomach. Decatur was rushed back to his home, and died there on March 22. A year after Decatur's death, his ghost reportedly began appearing at the house—standing in a second floor window looking out at H Street NW or leaving {{the back door of}} the house with a box of dueling pistols. So many witnesses saw the specter of Decatur that the window was walled up. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> also claimed that they can hear his widow, who became hysterical at his death, weeping in the house.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Matheson's {{opinion about the}} name Ljótr, the 20th-century historian A. Morrison was {{of the opinion that}} the name may not be as rare as <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> thought. Morrison noted that the 19th century antiquary F.W.L. Thomas considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods—this character was Ljótólfr, who would have lived on Lewis about a century before Leod's time. Morrison considered it possible that Leod's name could have ultimately originated from that of Ljótólfr's; however, while he considered it possible that Ljótólfr could have been an ancestor of Leod, he did not think it could have been in the male-line.|$|E
5|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD), {{also known}} simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by {{at least two weeks}} of low mood that is present across most situations. It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause. People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal while others nearly always have symptoms present. Major depressive disorder can negatively affect a person's personal, work, or school life, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health. Between 2–7% of adults with major depression die by suicide, and up to 60% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> opposed {{feminism}} on {{the grounds}} that they believe it is contrary to traditional values or religious beliefs. These anti-feminists argue, for example, that social acceptance of divorce and non-married women is wrong and harmful, and that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their different traditional roles in society should be maintained. mistake: the radical impact of feminism on church and culture | page = 10 | publisher = Crossway Books | location = Wheaton, Illinois | year = 2005 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781581345704 | quote = The feminist assault on traditional gender roles and families began in earnest in the 1960s and increasingly turned radical in the 1970s. }} Other anti-feminists oppose women's entry into the workforce, political office, and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families.|$|E

5|$|Negative {{perceptions}} of the Hinomaru exist in former colonies of Japan as well as within Japan itself, such as in Okinawa. In one notable example of this, on October 26, 1987, an Okinawan supermarket owner burned the Hinomaru {{before the start of}} the National Sports Festival of Japan. The flag burner, Shōichi Chibana, burned the Hinomaru not only to show opposition to atrocities committed by the Japanese army and the continued presence of U.S. forces, but also to prevent it from being displayed in public. Other incidents in Okinawa included the flag being torn down during school ceremonies and students refusing to honor the flag as it was being raised to the sounds of Kimigayo. In the capital city of Naha, Okinawa, the Hinomaru was raised for the first time since the return of Okinawa to Japan to celebrate the city's 80th anniversary in 2001. In the People's Republic of China and South Korea, both of which had been occupied by the Empire of Japan, the 1999 formal adoption of the Hinomaru was met with reactions of Japan moving towards the right and also a step towards re-militarization. The passage of the 1999 law also coincided with the debates about the status of the Yasukuni Shrine, US-Japan military cooperation and the creation of a missile defense program. In other nations that Japan occupied, the 1999 law was met with mixed reactions or glossed over. In Singapore, the older generation still harbors ill feelings toward the flag while the younger generation does not hold similar views. The Philippines government not only believed that Japan was not going to revert to militarism, but the goal of the 1999 law was to formally establish two symbols (the flag and anthem) in law and every state has a right to create national symbols. Japan has no law criminalizing the burning of the Hinomaru, but foreign flags cannot be burned in Japan. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> humorously drawn an analogy between the Japanese flag and the appearance of a menstruation stain on a white bedsheet.|$|E
