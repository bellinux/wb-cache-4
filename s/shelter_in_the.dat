5|$|Due to the hurricane's threat, workers fled oil {{platforms}} in the Gulf of Mexico, {{while the}} Coast Guard moved their boats inland. Officials in Mississippi suggested that about 100,000people evacuate the coastal counties. Shelters were opened in Hancock and Harrison counties, though only 68people {{went to a}} <b>shelter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> former. Gambling ships were moved into harbors and inland canals. Two run-offs for special legislative elections scheduled for August 25 were postponed.|$|E
5|$|Jeita IV (Mugharet-el-Mal) is a rock <b>shelter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cliff {{upstream}} from the grotto. It once contained a large quantity of Paleolithic material {{which has been}} looted and was deemed unfit for excavation by Sami Karkaby, Director of the Caverns in 1965. Study of the lithic remains at this shelter were hoped to shed further light on the Paleolithic or Mesolithic communities that inhabited the different sites at different times.|$|E
5|$|The Superdome {{sustained}} significant damage, {{including two}} {{sections of the}} roof when waterproof membrane had essentially been peeled off by wind. On August 30, Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco ordered the complete evacuation of the remaining people that sought <b>shelter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Superdome. They were then transported to the Astrodome in Houston, Texas.|$|E

40|$|Title: Emergency Overnight <b>in</b> Nature and <b>the</b> Project of <b>Shelters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Giant Mountains National Park. Some {{forms of}} outdoor trips include planned {{overnight}} under the open sky (bivouac) or {{in a tent}} without delay longer in place. This phenomenon (mainly in protected areas) comes into conflict with nature protection and {{need to find a}} compromise to satisfy both sides, the visitor and the institution administering the area. The aim of this thesis is to introduce the phenomenon of emergency overnight shelters and the possibilities of camping and bivouacking in nature at home and abroad, to ascertain the awareness of emergency <b>shelters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Šumava National Park at other Administrations of National Parks and Protected Landscape Areas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Czech Republic and propose suitable locations for <b>the</b> <b>shelters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Giant Mountains National Park. Quantitative research was conducted by questionnaire. It examined Administrations of National Parks and Protected Landscape Areas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Czech Republic. The obtained data were statistically processed in Microsoft Excel and interpreted in graphic and verbal form. Qualitative research was carried out using a structured interview with an employee of the Šumava National Park. Interview focuses on collecting data on the project of emergency <b>shelters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Šumava [...] ...|$|R

As Rick (Andrew Lincoln) escorts Carl back to the others, the walker horde emerges from the forest, and Rick and Carl take <b>shelter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> barn.|$|E
5|$|The local legend {{suggests}} that the Cailleach and her family were given <b>shelter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glen by the locals and while they stayed there the glen was always fertile and prosperous.

5|$|The {{men were}} met with jeers by a crowd of 2,000 to 4,000. This {{escalated}} into paving stones thrown {{through the door and}} windows of the building. Soldiers who subsequently arrived were beaten and driven away.

5|$|After {{the mint}} closed, it {{performed}} {{a variety of}} functions for the Federal government. It was first downgraded to an assay office for the U.S. Treasury {{as it had been}} from 1876 to 1879. Then, in 1932, the assay office closed and the building was converted into a Federal prison, in which capacity it served until 1943. The Coast Guard then took over the building as a nominal storage facility, though in truth the structure was largely abandoned and left to decay until it was transferred to the state of Louisiana in 1965. During the Cold War, when many believed there to be a high risk of nuclear war, the old Mint was considered to be the best fallout <b>shelter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 14th century, Conwy Castle was {{involved}} in the downfall of Richard II. Richard returned from Ireland in August 1399 and took <b>shelter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> castle from the forces of his rival, Henry Bolingbroke. Henry Percy, Bolingbroke's emissary, went into the castle to conduct negotiations with the king. Henry Percy took an oath in the castle chapel to protect the king if he agreed to leave the castle, but when Richard left he was promptly taken prisoner, and was taken away to die later in captivity at Pontefract Castle.|$|E

5|$|Bob {{receives}} a package containing his childhood toys, which consist of {{nothing more than}} a scouring pad, a rusted spatula, and a dog-shaped soap bar. The toys make Bob recall memories of constantly working at his father's restaurant, and he realizes that his job deprived him of a normal childhood. Worried that he is doing the same to his own children, he fires Tina, Gene and Louise and encourages them to enjoy their summer vacation. In their place, he hires newly released bank robber Mickey, whom the family had previously befriended, to do various jobs around the restaurant, in exchange for free meals and <b>shelter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basement.|$|E
5|$|During the winter, Ellie and Joel <b>shelter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains. Joel is on {{the brink}} of death and relies on Ellie to care for him. Hunting for food, Ellie {{encounters}} David (Nolan North) and James (Reuben Langdon), scavengers willing to trade medicine for food; David turns hostile after revealing the university bandits were part of his group. Ellie manages to lead David's group away from Joel, but is eventually captured; David intends to recruit her into his cannibal group. Refusing the offer, she escapes after killing James, but David corners her in a burning restaurant. Meanwhile, Joel recovers from his wounds and sets out to find Ellie. He reaches Ellie as she kills David and breaks down crying; Joel comforts her before they flee.|$|E
5|$|Implementation of Care Not Cash {{began on}} July 1, 2004. As {{part of his}} Care Not Cash initiative, 5,000 more {{homeless}} people were given permanent <b>shelter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city. As of October 21, 2007, about 2,000 people have been placed into permanent housing with support. Other programs initiated by Newsom to end chronic homelessness include the San Francisco Homeless Outreach Team (SF HOT), and Project Homeless Connect (PHC). On October 27, 2004, during a strike by hotel workers on a dozen San Francisco hotels, Newsom joined UNITE HERE union members on a picket line {{in front of the}} Westin St. Francis Hotel. He vowed that the city would boycott the hotels by not sponsoring city events in any until the hotels agreed to a contract with workers. The contract dispute was settled in September 2006.|$|E

5|$|In 1574, Queen Elizabeth I {{promoted}} {{the restoration of}} the church, to serve as the grand parish church of Bath. She ordered that a national fund should be set up to finance the work, and in 1583 decreed that it should become the parish church of Bath. James Montague, the Bishop of Bath and Wells from 1608–1616, paid £1,000 for a new nave roof of timber lath construction; according to the inscription on his tomb, this was prompted after seeking <b>shelter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> roofless nave during a thunderstorm. He is buried in an alabaster tomb in the north aisle.|$|E
5|$|Nearby is {{the former}} site of St. Mary's (Whitechapel Road) tube station. It opened in March 1884 but its close {{proximity}} to both Whitechapel and Aldgate East tube stations made it superfluous, leading to its closure in April 1938. It {{was used as an}} air raid <b>shelter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Second World War, but was destroyed by bombing in 1940. Opposite to the south {{is the former}} Royal London Hospital building, built in 1740. The hospital suffered significant structural damage during the Second World War, but much of the 18th and 19th centuries architecture still remains. A new building now sits adjacent to the original.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{subsequent}} French {{effort to reach}} Martinique, launched in February 1809 before news of the British invasion had reached Europe. Three ships {{of the line and}} two disarmed frigates were sent with soldiers and supplies towards the island, but learned of Villaret de Joyeuse's surrender in late March and instead took <b>shelter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Îles des Saintes, blockaded by Cochrane's squadron. On 14 April, Cochrane seized the Saintes and the French fled, the three ships of the line drawing away Cochrane's forces so that the frigates could slip away and reach Guadeloupe. During the ensuing Action of 14–17 April 1809, the French flagship Hautpoult was chased down and captured, but two escaped and the frigates reached Guadeloupe, although neither would ever return to France.|$|E

2500|$|There is no {{evidence}} to suggest that moa were colonial nesters. While evidence of moa nesting is often inferred from accumulations of eggshell fragments found in caves and rock shelters, little evidence exists of the nests themselves. Excavations of rock <b>shelters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern North Island during the 1940s uncovered moa nests, which were described as [...] "small depressions obviously scratched out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soft dry pumice". Moa nesting material has also been recovered from rock <b>shelters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Central Otago region of the South Island, where the dry climate has resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> preservation of plant material used to construct the nesting platform (including twigs that have been clipped by moa bills). Seeds and pollen within moa coprolites found amongst the nesting material provide evidence that the nesting season was late spring to summer.|$|R
5|$|Thousands of {{residents}} evacuated coastal areas of South Carolina, {{many of whom}} stayed at inland hotels; 850people sought protection in shelters, including 500 at an elementary school in Horry County and 240 in a <b>shelter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grand Strand. In Beaufort County, city and county offices were closed early and businesses were advised to send their workers home prematurely. Officials in Chatham County, Georgia evacuated nursing homes on Tybee Island, and encouraged others to leave due to the potential for high tides to isolate the island by cutting off U.S. Route 80.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of the Balkan Wars, Prince Andrew was {{reinstated}} in the army and Princess Andrew acted as a nurse, assisting at operations and setting up field hospitals, work for which King George V awarded her the Royal Red Cross in 1913. During World War I, her brother-in-law, King Constantine of Greece, followed a neutrality policy despite the democratically elected government of Venizelos supporting the Allies. Princess Andrew and her children were forced to <b>shelter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> palace cellars during the French bombardment of Athens on 1 December 1916. By June 1917, the King's neutrality policy had become so untenable that she {{and other members of the}} Greek royal family were forced into exile when her brother-in-law abdicated. For the next few years, most of the Greek royal family lived in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|According to naval {{historian}} Ian Buxton, {{the most}} important role of the Royal Navy was to blockade the Dardanelles and thus guard the Eastern Mediterranean against a breakout by Goeben. On 12 January 1918, Rear-Admiral Arthur Hayes-Sadler hoisted his flag aboard Lord Nelson at Mudros as the new commander of the Aegean Squadron. Needing transportation to Salonika for a conference with the British Army commander there, and finding his personal yacht unavailable, Hayes-Sadler opted to have Lord Nelson take him there, and thus she was not present when Goeben and Breslau finally made their breakout attempt on 20 January. The ship could not {{get back to the}} Dardanelles in time to participate in the resulting Battle of Imbros or intercept Goeben before she gained <b>shelter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dardanelles. Lord Nelson was later given a short refit at Malta in October.|$|E
