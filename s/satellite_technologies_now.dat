40|$|When {{monitoring}} {{local or}} regional hydrosphere dynamics for {{applications such as}} agricultural productivity or drought and flooding events, {{it is necessary to}} have accurate, high-resolution estimates of terrestrial water and energy storages. Though in-situ observations provide reliable estimates of hydrologic states and fluxes, they are only capable of accurately capturing the dynamics at relatively discrete points in space and time, which makes them inadequate for characterizing the variability of the water budget across scales. In contrast, satellite-based remote sensing is ideal for providing observations of hydrological states and fluxes because it provides spatially-distributed observations at spatial and temporal scales required for regional land surface process modeling. Due to the continued progress in algorithm development and emerging <b>satellite</b> <b>technology,</b> we <b>now</b> have near-real time monitoring of several components of the water cycle including precipitation, soil moisture, lake and river height, terrestrial water storage, snow cover, and evapotranspiration. As these data become more readily available, their application to hydrologic modeling is becoming more common, however there remains little consensus on the most appropriate method for optimal integration and evaluation in regard to hydrological applications. Here we present two case studies operationally applying several remotely sensed products from AMSR-E, GRACE, and MODIS and discuss assimilation strategies, ease of integration and interpretation, and methods for quantifying the success of the application methodology...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{potential}} {{applications of}} wireless data communications and mobile <b>satellite</b> <b>technology</b> are described which aim at improving education. The motivation behind {{this work is}} that the <b>technology</b> <b>now</b> exists for providing today's teachers and students with not only better access to educational facilities, but also instantaneous communications with distant sites and mobile units. Wireless data communications systems integrated with mobile <b>satellite</b> <b>technology</b> use wireless radio packet modems for message transmission between a fixed dispatching center and mobile units. Messages are relayed over a wireless data network, and mobile units are equipped with satellite receivers which read signals from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites. A discussion of mobile satellite communications includes an examination of GPS, the Magellan AIV- 10 OEM GPS Module, and Blue Marble Graphics MAIL Map, Geo View, and GeoCalc.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Master of Science In Environmental Systems: Mathematical Modeling, 2004. Patricia O. McConkey Outstanding Thesis Award, 2005 Landmines are {{currently}} being cleared using unmanned vehicles. There {{is a need for}} verification of the ground covered by a vehicle???s landmine clearing apparatus to ensure clearance of the entire minefield. Recent advancements in <b>satellite</b> positioning <b>technology</b> <b>now</b> make accurate verification possible. In this project we will model the ground covered by the clearance apparatus of a landmine clearance vehicle to a specified confidence level using real-time kinematic differential GPS and inertial sensing technologies. A two-dimensional probability density function of the ground covered by the front flail will be developed. The probability density function is intended to be a main component in a real-time two-dimensional mapping application for tracking the ground covered by a landmine clearance vehicle. It will be a function of the following: ??? Flail size (length and width) ??? Position of the flail in relation to the GPS antenna ??? GPS antenna position ??? GPS antenna position error ??? Vehicle heading ??? Vehicle heading error This function relates to the probability a point was covered when given the estimated vehicle state by an INS/GPS system. A method for implementing the probability density function into software is explained. The viability of the software implementation is then tested through an experiment conducted using a prototype landmine clearance vehicle. Results of the experiment show that the implementation is effective at limiting both Type I and Type II errors...|$|R

These <b>technologies</b> <b>now</b> produce information that can create a competitive advantage and are emerging as valuable tools to marketing decisionmakers. Remote Sensing (RS) as defined here refers to the set of <b>satellite</b> <b>technologies</b> that produce images for the design and production that are exact replica of a geographic location and relevant situation. These are high-resolution images of specific geographic locations that depict the exact location {{on the surface of the}} Earth. These technologies also include the location identification and tracking systems that employ remote sensing technologies such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS). The term geographic information systems (GIS) as employed here refers to the set of integrated computer hardware units, various software programs and database systems that transform geographically coded data into information that create maps of the Earth's surface (Marshall, 1997). The maps may optionally be overlaid with additional and selective information showing social, demographic, economic, and physical characteristics and infrastructure data corresponding to specific geographic locations. A GIS with RS technologies provides a different perspective on geo-demographics, consumer behavior and competitive market situations because of the synoptic view provided from a GIS supported by remote sensin...|$|R
