5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} {{about the origin}} of Bowie seamount: Geological studies indicate that the Kodiak-Bowie <b>Seamount</b> <b>chain</b> may have formed above a center of upwelling magma called a mantle plume. The seamounts comprising the Kodiak-Bowie <b>Seamount</b> <b>chain</b> would be formed above the mantle plume and carried away from the mantle plume's magmatic source as the Pacific Plate moves in a northwesterly direction towards the Aleutian Trench, along the southern coastline of Alaska.|$|E
40|$|The {{probable}} N 055 °-oriented extinct spreading {{ridge of}} the East Sub-basin is cut across by the post-spreading volcanic ridge oriented approximately E–W in its western part {{and called the}} Zhenbei–Huangyan <b>seamounts</b> <b>chain.</b> A three-dimensional ocean bottom seismometer survey was conducted in 2011 and covered both the extinct spreading ridge and the Zhenbei–Huangyan <b>seamounts</b> <b>chain</b> in the East Sub-basin. The comprehensive seismic record sections of 39 ocean bottom seismometers underline the high-quality data with clear and reliable P-wave seismic first arrivals. The three-dimensional tomographic {{results show that the}} crust is oceanic {{on each side of the}} Zhenbei–Huangyan <b>seamounts</b> <b>chain.</b> The seafloor spreading lineaments and associated fracture zones pattern provide channels for magma migration and eruption. Based on the ratio of volcanic extrusive and intrusive materials and the shape of the upward convex 6. 4 [*]km/s iso-velocity curve beneath the Zhenbei and Huangyan seamounts, we conclude that the Zhenbei and Huangyan seamounts appear to be dominantly formed by intra-crustal intrusion. Combining previous geochemical studies of post-spreading volcanic ridge outcropping samples, the formation mechanism of the <b>seamounts</b> <b>chain</b> might be explained by a buoyancy-driven decompression melting mechanism occurring as separately evolving partial melting bodies beneath each seamount...|$|R
40|$|The 140 -km wide last {{phase of}} {{opening of the}} South China Sea (SCS) {{corresponds}} to a N 145 ° direction of spreading with rift features identified on swath bathymetric data trending N 055 ° (Sibuet et al., 2016). These N 055 ° seafloor spreading features of the East Sub-basin are cut across by a post-spreading volcanic ridge oriented approximately E-W in its western part (Zhenbei-Huangyan <b>seamounts</b> <b>chain).</b> The knowledge of the deep crustal structure beneath this volcanic ridge is essential to elucidate not only the formation and tectonic evolution of the SCS, but also the mechanism of emplacement of the post-spreading magmatism. We use air-gun shots recorded by ocean bottom seismometers to image the deep crustal structure along the N-S oriented G 8 G 0 seismic profile, which is perpendicular to the Zhenbei-Huangyan <b>seamounts</b> <b>chain</b> but located in between the Zhenbei and Huangyan seamounts, where topographic changes are minimum. The velocity structure presents obvious lateral variations. The crust {{north and south of}} the Zhenbei-Huangyan <b>seamounts</b> <b>chain</b> is ca. 4 - 6 km in thickness and velocities are largely comparable with those of normal oceanic crust of Atlantic type. To the south, the Jixiang seamount with a 7. 2 -km thick crust, seems to be a tiny post-spreading volcanic seamount intruded along the former extinct spreading ridge axis. In the central part, a 1. 5 -km thick low velocity zone (3. 3 - 3. 7 km/s) in the uppermost crust is explained by the presence of extrusive rocks intercalated with thin sedimentary layers as those drilled at IODP Site U 1431. Both the Jixiang seamount and the Zhenbei-Huangyan <b>seamounts</b> <b>chain</b> started to form by the intrusion of decompressive melt resulting from the N-S post-spreading phase of extension and intruded through the already formed oceanic crust. The Jixiang seamount probably formed before the emplacement of the E-W post-spreading <b>seamounts</b> <b>chain...</b>|$|R

5|$|Models of how Siletzia formed are of {{two general}} types: (1) Formation well {{offshore}} (possibly as seamounts, like the Hawaiian-Emperor <b>seamount</b> <b>chain,</b> or a hotspot at a spreading ridge, like Iceland) and then accretion to the continent; (2) formation inshore, {{on or near}} the continental margin (perhaps as a result of transcurrent extension, or of a slab window).

5|$|The {{accretion}} of Siletzia {{against the}} North American continent approximately 50 {{million years ago}} (contemporaneous with the initiation of the bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor <b>seamount</b> <b>chain)</b> was a major tectonic event associated with a reorganization of the earth's tectonic plates.

40|$|The {{formation}} of intraplate volcanic ridges {{on the south}} Pacific seafloor {{do not appear to}} be governed by conventional models of tectonic plate motion over a stationary hotspot. Although these volcanic <b>seamount</b> <b>chains</b> are oriented perpendicular to the plate spreading axis and parallel to the Pacific plate motion direction, geochemical evidence suggests that volcanism along the Pukapuka ridge propagates from west to east at a rate of 300 mm/yr, approximately 3 times faster than the plate velocity (Sandwell et al., 1995). Pronounced isotopic anomalies are found along the East Pacific Rise (EPR) (Mahoney et al., 1994) where the Pukapuka ridge is projected to have intersected the spreading center; anomalies with the same mixing trend that is found in Pukapuka (Janney et al., 2000), suggesting that there is material transport of anomalous mantle associated with volcanic ridge formation. We present seismic and petrologic results from the MELT and GLIMPSE marine geophysical expeditions indicating that enriched, and/or hotter mantle may underlie Pukapuka-type <b>seamount</b> <b>chains.</b> We are developing a new, alternative model in which intraplate volcanism is the surface expression of return flow to the EPR concentrated in low-viscosity channels or fingers in the asthenosphere...|$|R

5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor <b>seamount</b> <b>chain</b> reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain. Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E

5|$|The {{volcanic}} rocks {{which make}} {{up some of the}} seamounts in the Kodiak-Bowie <b>Seamount</b> <b>chain</b> are unusual in that they have an acid-neutralizing chemical substance like typical ocean-island basalts but a low percentage of strontium as found at mid-ocean ridge basalts. However, the strontium-bearing volcanic rocks comprising Bowie Seamount also contain lead. Therefore, the magma mixtures that formed Bowie Seamount seem to have originated from varying degrees of partial melting of a depleted source in the Earth's mantle and basalts which had distinctly high lead isotopic ratios. Estimates during geological studies indicate that the abundance of the depleted-source component ranges from 60 to 80 percent of the erupted material.|$|E
5|$|Lōʻihi Seamount's first {{depiction}} {{on a map}} was on Survey Chart 4115, a bathymetric {{rendering of}} part of Hawaiʻi compiled by the US Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1940.

MacDonald hypothesized that the seamount was actually an active submarine shield volcano, similar to the two active Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kīlauea. Macdonald's hypothesis placed the seamount as the newest volcano in the Hawaiian-Emperor <b>seamount</b> <b>chain,</b> created by the Hawaiʻi hotspot. However, because the earthquakes were oriented east–west (the direction of the volcanic fault) {{and there was no}} volcanic tremor in seismometers distant from the seamount, Macdonald attributed the earthquake to faulting rather than a volcanic eruption.|$|E

5|$|The Hawaiian–Emperor <b>seamount</b> <b>chain</b> is {{a series}} of volcanoes and seamounts {{extending}} across the Pacific Ocean. The chain has been produced by the movement of the ocean crust over the Hawaii hotspot, an upwelling of hot rock from the Earth's mantle. As the oceanic crust moves the volcanoes farther away from their source of magma, their eruptions become less frequent and less powerful until they eventually cease to erupt altogether. At that point erosion of the volcano and subsidence of the seafloor cause the volcano to gradually diminish. As the volcano sinks and erodes, it first becomes an atoll island and then an atoll. Further subsidence causes the volcano to sink below the sea surface, becoming a seamount and/or a guyot. This list documents the most significant volcanoes in the chain, ordered by distance from the hotspot; however, there are many others that have yet to be properly studied.|$|E
5|$|The {{oldest and}} most heavily eroded part of the chain are the Emperor seamounts, which are 39 to 85million years in age. The Emperor and Hawaiian chains are {{separated}} by a large L-shaped bend that causes the orientations of the chains to differ by about 60°. This bend was long attributed to a relatively sudden change {{in the direction of}} plate motion, but research conducted in 2003 suggests that it was the movement of the hotspot itself that caused the bend. The issue is still currently under debate. All of the volcanoes {{in this part of the}} chain have long since subsided below sea level, becoming seamounts and guyots (see also the seamount and guyot stages of Hawaiian volcanism). Many of the volcanoes are named after former emperors of Japan. The <b>seamount</b> <b>chain</b> extends to the West Pacific, and terminates at the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, a subduction zone at the border of Russia.|$|E
5|$|The Hawaii hotspot is a {{volcanic}} hotspot {{located near the}} namesake Hawaiian Islands, in the northern Pacific Ocean. One of the most well-known and heavily studied hotspots in the world, the Hawaii plume {{is responsible for the}} creation of the Hawaiian – Emperor <b>seamount</b> <b>chain,</b> a chain of volcanoes over 5,800 kilometres (3,600mi) long. Four of these volcanoes are active, two are dormant, and more than 123 are extinct, many having since been ground beneath the waves by erosion as seamounts and atolls. The chain extends from south of the island of Hawaii {{to the edge of the}} Aleutian Trench, near the eastern edge of Russia. While most volcanoes are created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries, the Hawaii hotspot is located far from plate boundaries. The classic hotspot theory, first proposed in 1963 by John Tuzo Wilson, proposes that a single, fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then, cut off from their source by the movement of the Pacific Plate, become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level over millions of years. According to this theory, the nearly 60° bend where the Emperor and Hawaiian segments of the chain meet was caused by a sudden shift in the movement of the Pacific Plate. In 2003, fresh investigations of this irregularity led to the proposal of a mobile hotspot theory, suggesting that hotspots are mobile, not fixed, and that the 47-million-year-old bend was caused by a shift in the hotspot's motion rather than the plate's.|$|E
40|$|A stratigraphic {{sequence}} in the Yamato Basin is acoustically distinguished between {{the central and}} northeastern portions. In the central portion we can identify at least six acoustic units. Units except acoustic basement and volcanic apron sediments distributed around the Yamato <b>Seamounts</b> <b>Chain</b> are correlated with four detrital turbidites from middle Miocene to Recent. The Toyama Deep Sea Fan, uppermost unit, has been formed since 0. 5 Ma based on the drilling result of DSDP Site 299. The huge sediments supply to the Yamato Basin through the Toyama Deep Sea Channel was presumably caused by the uplift of the Hida Mountains. The acoustic basement of the Yamato Basin is characterized by smooth morphology associated with low frequency stratified reflectors when compared to normal oceanic layer II. We propose that the acoustic basement is composed of an alternation of sediments and sill. The Yamato <b>Seamounts</b> <b>Chain</b> aligning in NE-SW direction in the central portion of the Yamato Basin was built by the same volcanism responsible for the basalt sill. Northeast of 39 ° 40 'N, an acoustic basement shows morphologically high relief and the {{stratigraphic sequence}} differs from that in the central portion. The high relief is identified with the eastern extension of the Yamato Rise. It is thought that the high relief of the acoustic basement and the Yamato Rise structurally separate the Yamato Basin from the Japan Basin. 大和海盆の音響層序は中央部と北東部で区別される. 中央部では少なくとも 6 層が音響的に識別される. 基盤および大和海山列周辺に見らるvolcanic apron sedimentsをのぞいた各層はMiddleMioceneからHoloceneの 4 層の砕屑性乱泥流堆積物に対比される. 富山深海扇状地は最上位層に相当し,その形成は約 50 万年前から始まったと考えられ,これは飛騨山脈の隆起により大量の堆積物がもたらされた結果であろう. 音響的基盤はその上面が平坦であること,また内部に反射面を持つことで特徴づけられ,堆積物とそれに貫入したシルから構成されていると推測される. 海盆中央に北東-南西方向に配列している大和海山列はシルをもたらしたと同じ火成活動により形成されたものと思われる. この火成活動の年代は,背弧拡大により海盆が形成されたと考えられる 15 Ma前と同時かあるいはわずかに後と思われる. 大和海盆の北緯 39 ° 4 'より北東では層序が異なり,しかも音響的基盤は地形的にせり上がっている. この基盤の高まりの西延長が大和堆に当たる. つまり大和堆を含めた基盤の高まりが大和海盆と日本海盆を構造的に区分している...|$|R
