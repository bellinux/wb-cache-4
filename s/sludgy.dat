25|$|Historically, {{the river}} was {{actively}} dredged by Boral Sands Inc, ostensibly to make the river navigable. The constant extraction of river bed material by dredges has had considerable effect on the river. These impacts include increased turbidity, bed and bank erosion and changes in tidal hydraulics. The tidal nature {{of the river and}} the generally muddy nature of the sands removed by dredging created a woefully <b>sludgy</b> clayey sediment load in the river which did not clear.|$|E
25|$|Sludge doom (also {{known as}} sludge metal) is {{a style that}} {{combines}} doom metal and hardcore punk, and sometimes southern rock. Many sludge bands compose slow and heavy songs that contain brief hardcore passages. However, some bands emphasise fast tempos throughout their music. The string instruments are heavily distorted and are often played with large amounts of feedback to produce an abrasive, <b>sludgy</b> sound. Drumming is often performed in typical doom metal fashion, but drummers may employ hardcore d-beat or double-kick drumming during faster passages. Vocals are usually shouted or screamed, and lyrics often focus on suffering, drug abuse, politics and anger towards society. The style was pioneered in the early late 1980s by the Melvins, and in the 1990s by bands such as Eyehategod, Crowbar, Buzzov*en, Acid Bath and Grief.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, the slow, heavy, and <b>sludgy</b> {{style of}} the Melvins was a {{significant}} influence on the grunge sound. Roy Shuker states that grunge's success built on the [...] "foundations...laid throughout the 1980s by earlier alternative music scenes." [...] Shuker states that music critics [...] "...emphasized the perceived purity and authenticity of the Seattle scene.|$|E
5000|$|Guitarist Greg Mackintosh {{said of the}} record, “The {{new album}} will be slower, <b>sludgier</b> and more doom filled than ever before.” He adds {{that it will be}} “eight riff laden monster tracks of sheer Northern misery.” ...|$|R
50|$|Disease is {{the second}} studio album by the industrial/horror techno band G.G.F.H.. This album saw the band take a more techno approach, pushing aside the <b>sludgier</b> sound of their earlier material. The album {{features}} three of the tracks recorded for the Reality EP, (Room 213, Dead Men Don’t Rape, Real), {{in a slightly different}} form.|$|R
5000|$|According to Giant Squid's {{official}} website, [...] "The {{middle eastern}} aesthetic that the band has embraced throughout its entire cannon consumes this new material to its core. Riff worship meets gypsy jangle and Arabesque male/female vocal harmonies, further enhancing the band's trademark, otherworldly, musical storytelling. Unarguably, Cenotes is the deepest, fastest, <b>sludgiest,</b> and most adventurous release from Giant Squid yet." ...|$|R
500|$|Some critics {{commented that}} the album is not as {{appealing}} to audiences who are unfamiliar with the band. Saul Austerlitz from The Boston Globe wrote that the album was [...] "intended to cater primarily to rabid fans", commenting {{that those who are}} not fans of Slipknot will probably [...] "find the experience of listening to both discs of 9.0: Live roughly comparable to being hit in the head repeatedly with a two-by-four two hours of <b>sludgy,</b> indistinguishable songs, punctuated by profane outbursts about how the idiot media [...] has ignored and abused them".|$|E
500|$|In {{the book}} Legends of Rock Guitar, Hell Awaits {{was defined as}} [...] "a {{psychotic}} exploration {{into the depths of}} Satanism and physical torture." [...] The book, a chronology of the great guitarists of rock which includes both Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, observed the band's evolution in comparison with their previous album, Show No Mercy, saying, [...] "The musicianship is improved, as is lead singer Tom Araya's voice, making the band sound less like hacks and more like metal fiends. The <b>sludgy</b> riffs, which were pure [...] Sabbath, are offset by some of King's and Hanneman's faster solos, giving Slayer entrée into the speed metal realm." ...|$|E
500|$|Grunge is {{generally}} {{characterized by a}} <b>sludgy</b> electric guitar sound with a [...] "thick" [...] middle register and rolled-off treble tone and {{a high level of}} distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers [...] and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs [...] ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most [...] "lugubrious sound"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive [...] "buildup of sonic fog". or even dismissed as [...] "noise" [...] by one critic. As with metal and hardcore, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.|$|E
5|$|Powerviolence is a raw and dissonant subgenre of {{hardcore}} punk. The {{style is}} closely related to thrashcore and similar to grindcore. While powerviolence took inspiration from Napalm Death and other early grind bands, powerviolence groups avoided elements of heavy metal. Its nascent form was pioneered in the late 1980s in the music of hardcore punk band Infest, who mixed youth crew hardcore elements with noisier, <b>sludgier</b> qualities of Lärm and Siege. The microgenre solidified into its most commonly recognized form in the early 1990s, with the sounds of bands such as Man Is the Bastard, Crossed Out, No Comment, Capitalist Casualties, and Manpig.|$|R

Chris Gramlich of Exclaim! said {{the album was}} [...] "Conceptually darker", {{compared}} to The Burial Plot Bidding War, {{and said it was}} [...] "lyrically and artistically, laced with black-humour, technical excursions, metallic breaks, [...] intertwining and eclectic guitar work". Jason D. Taylor of AllMusic says the album showcases the band [...] "careening from metalcore crunch to exhausting screamo and even meandering into slightly emotional melodic singing" [...] to the likes of Glassjaw. Mustapha Mond of Lambgoat said the album had a [...] "darker, <b>sludgier</b> metal sound." ...|$|R

500|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, the American {{alternative}} scene {{was dominated by}} styles ranging from quirky alternative pop (They Might Be Giants and Camper Van Beethoven), to noise rock (Sonic Youth, Big Black, The Jesus Lizard) and industrial rock (Ministry, Nine Inch Nails). These sounds were in turn followed by the advent of Boston's Pixies and Los Angeles' Jane's Addiction. Around the same time, the grunge subgenre emerged in Seattle, Washington, initially referred to as [...] "The Seattle Sound" [...] until its rise to popularity in the early 1990s. Grunge featured a <b>sludgy,</b> murky guitar sound that synthesized heavy metal and punk rock. Promoted largely by Seattle indie label Sub Pop, grunge bands were noted for their thrift store fashion which favored flannel shirts and combat boots suited to the local weather. Early grunge bands Soundgarden and Mudhoney found critical acclaim in the U.S. and UK, respectively.|$|E
500|$|The {{digestive}} {{system of the}} octopus begins with the buccal mass which consists of the mouth, pharynx, radula and salivary glands. The radula is a spiked, tongue-like organ made of chitin. Food is broken down and is forced into the oesophagus by two lateral extensions of the esophageal side walls {{in addition to the}} radula. From there it is transferred to the gastrointestinal tract, which is mostly suspended from the roof of the mantle cavity by numerous membranes. The tract consists of a crop, where the food is stored, a stomach, where food is ground down, a caecum where the now <b>sludgy</b> food is sorted into fluids and particles and which {{plays an important role in}} absorption, the digestive gland, where liver cells break down and absorb the fluid and become [...] "brown bodies", and the intestine, where the accumulated waste is turned into faecal ropes by secretions and blown out of the funnel via the rectum.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} edition peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart, while the reissue charted at number 43 on the Top Independent Albums chart. Russ Hockenbury of AbsolutePunk said the album [...] "improved on every level" [...] from their previous album, And Their Name Was Treason. McKinnon's vocals were noted by Hockenbury as [...] "the greatest improvement". Allmusic reviewer Corey Apar spoke of [...] "Fast Forward to 2012" [...] {{as being an}} appropriate opening track that summarized a [...] "display of the band's volatile persona; it launches forth in melodic hardcore mode before quickly dropping into death snarling and <b>sludgy</b> riffing". Apar {{also said that the}} combination endures [...] "in varying levels" [...] {{throughout the rest of the}} album. For PopMatters, Andrew Blackie had written the album was a mix of [...] "death metal grunts with the brash melodies of pop-punk". Speaking of [...] "The Plot to Bomb the Panhandle", Blackie said the song had [...] "a Green Day sensibility to it", with music that [...] "fitted together with class and precision" [...] helped by that of Shelnutt.|$|E
500|$|Kim Neely of Rolling Stone {{dismissed}} the album as [...] "genuinely offensive satanic drivel". However, the magazine would later rank the album 47th on their 2017 [...] "100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time" [...] list. Slayer's official biography states: [...] "The new sounds disappointed {{some of the}} band's fans who were more accustomed to the style of earlier releases." [...] Michael Roberts of Westworld Online said {{this was due to}} some of the numbers moving [...] "at the <b>sludgier</b> speed of Black Sabbath". Araya commented that the [...] "album was a late bloomer—it wasn't really received well, but it kind of grew on everybody later".|$|R
500|$|... "Enter Sandman" [...] was {{the second}} music video from Metallica. It {{was also the first}} of six Metallica music videos {{directed}} by Wayne Isham. [...] Recorded on July 3, 1991 in Los Angeles, it premiered on July 30, 1991, two weeks before the release of the album. The plot of the music video directly relates to the theme of the song, combining images of a child having nightmares and images of an old man (R. G. Armstrong) with shots of the band playing the song. The child dreams that he is drowning, falling from the top of a building, covered in snakes, being chased by a truck and finally falling from a mountain while escaping the truck. During the part of the song in which the child recites a prayer, he is being watched by the Sandman. Throughout the video, the picture flickers continuously. The music video won Best Hard Rock Video at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards and was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Editing. Andrew Blackie of PopMatters has said the video's [...] "narrative suits the <b>sludgy</b> riffs and James Hetfield’s twisted lullaby lyric".|$|E
500|$|Devil's Halo was {{released}} by Downtown Records on October 6, 2009, to generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on seven reviews. In Billboard, Gary Graff wrote that the record [...] "neatly straddles a line between challenging and accessible", featuring some of Ndegéocello's strongest compositions yet. Jurek claimed she [...] "hasn't been so nakedly vulnerable and brazenly honest on record as she is here". Tyler Lewis of PopMatters hailed it as her most consistent and [...] "emotionally potent work" [...] since 1999's Bitter while adding that Devil's Halo featured [...] "a greater sense of perspective of life's realities". According to Q, the songs expressing frantic feelings were balanced by [...] "unpredictable but always apposite moments of beauty". Salon journalist Heather Havrilesky said [...] "like a world-weary muse, Ndegéocello taps into something rich and melancholy at the <b>sludgy</b> bottom of our hearts" [...] while possessing a [...] "mellow depth" [...] in her singing. Washington Post critic Mark Jenkins believed the music's [...] "stripped-down approach accentuated her musical brawn". Noel Murray from The A.V. Club found the album [...] "bracingly unpredictable and persistently enjoyable; it's an art-soul record {{for those who like}} to be challenged while they’re tapping their toes. Or vice versa".|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1980s, {{northern}} West Coast state bands such as Melvins, Flipper and Green River {{developed a}} <b>sludgy,</b> [...] "aggressive sound that melded the slower tempos of heavy metal with {{the intensity of}} hardcore," [...] creating an alternative rock subgenre known as grunge. Grunge evolved from the local Seattle punk rock scene, and it was inspired by bands such as The Fartz, 10 Minute Warning and The Accüsed. Grunge fuses elements of hardcore and heavy metal, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other. Grunge's key guitar influences included Black Flag and The Melvins. Black Flag's 1984 record My War, on which the band combined heavy metal with their traditional sound, made a strong impact in Seattle.|$|E
2500|$|Bring Me the Horizon have {{attempted}} to grow and change with each album, as they believe each album should be different. Raziq Rauf, when writing for Drowned In Sound, Described Count Your Blessings as possessing [...] "Norma Jean-style thunderous riffs mixed with some dastardly <b>sludgy</b> doom moments and more breakdowns than your dad's old Nissan Sunny." [...] Suicide Season was described by Metal Hammer as a [...] "creative, critical and commercial success" [...] for the band as they started to adopt a more eclectic style, with its [...] "crushingly heavy party deathcore". Leading up to its release Sykes described [...] it as [...] "100% different to Count Your Blessings" [...] and that the album sounds [...] "more rock than metal". As time went by, Bring Me the Horizon became rejecting of their debut album Count Your Blessings and considered Suicide Season as their [...] "Year Zero [...] wipe-the-slate-clean time".|$|E
2500|$|According to DeRogatis, {{the roots}} of stoner rock can be heard on Black Sabbath's Master of Reality, Hawkwind's 25 Years On 1973–1977 box set, the {{aforementioned}} Blue Cheer album, Deep Purple's Machine Head and Blue Öyster Cult's Workshop of the Telescopes. Black Sabbath's Master of Reality is often cited as the first album of the genre, and Martin Popoff states: [...] "When 'Sweet Leaf' kicks in, one witnesses simultaneously the invention of stoner rock". Allmusic summarizes this unique fusion as follows: [...] "Stoner metal bands updated the long, mind-bending jams and ultra-heavy riffs of bands like Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer, Blue Öyster Cult, and Hawkwind by filtering their psychedelia-tinged metal and acid rock through the buzzing sound of early Sub Pop–style grunge." [...] However, Kyuss members Josh Homme and John Garcia have shrugged off the heavy metal influence, and instead cite punk rock and hardcore punk, particularly the <b>sludgy</b> hardcore of Black Flag's album My War as influences.|$|E
2500|$|Predicting {{critical}} reception to the {{new direction}} of the album, Cronise proposed that [...] "It will absolutely alienate some fans. The kind of music we play is partially described as heavy metal and unfortunately, a lot of dudes that like heavy metal are very narrow-minded and only like it to sound one particular way. So I'm sure we alienated people with our second album." [...] Despite this, he assured that {{the sound of the}} music would not change as much, explaining that [...] "There'll definitely still be heavy stuff on the record, and fast, thrashy, and slow and <b>sludgy</b> stuff like we've done before. Heavy metal, basically. But a lot of the songs are just what I'd call hard rock songs. The attitude and the vibe is different. It's not as aggressive, sonically. It's a little bit more ... I don't know how to explain it. It's just rock. It's a rock album. Some parts will be heavier than the heaviest stuff we've done, but at the same time, there will be acoustic stuff. It is a varied record, I guess.|$|E
2500|$|AllMusic's Johnny Loftus {{called the}} song [...] "flawless". According to Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe, the song [...] "...is {{a mix of}} Lee's {{ethereal}} soprano, piano interludes, and layers of serrated guitar crunch that conjure visions of Sarah McLachlan fronting Godsmack." [...] In his review of Evanescence's second studio album, The Open Door, Brendan Butler of Cinema Blend compared [...] "Sweet Sacrifice" [...] (2007) with [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] calling them [...] "...radio-friendly songs." [...] Jason Nahrung of The Courier-Mail called the song [...] "...an ear-grabber". Adrien Bengrad of the website PopMatters said that Lee and McCoy made [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] sound [...] "...like a love song between a Lilith Fair girl and an Ozzfest dude." [...] Blair R. Fischer from MTV News called the song a [...] "...ubiquitous rap-rock confection". Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said that [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] "...floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee and then hits like a brick." [...] Richard Harrington from The Washington Post called [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] a [...] "...crunching metallic" [...] song which helped the band to win a Grammy Award. Joe D'Angelo called it an [...] "...unrelenting paean that begins as hauntingly delicate" [...] and that [...] "Lee's vocals soar above the whole <b>sludgy</b> mixture {{to keep it from}} sinking into tired mediocrity." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} to mid-1990s, a number of southern-California bands {{developed}} the style that would be called stoner rock. In 1992, Kyuss emerged from the Palm Desert Scene with Blues for the Red Sun. Critics have hailed it as [...] "a major milestone in heavy music," [...] while NME described their music {{as an attempt to}} figuratively melt [...] "a hundredweight of hot desert sand into metal". In 1992, San Jose doom metal band Sleep released their album Sleep's Holy Mountain, and along with Kyuss were heralded by the heavy metal press as leaders of the emerging stoner scene. These two bands {{were among the first to}} introduce a psychedelic groove to their doom-influenced sound. During the same year, New Jersey's Monster Magnet released their debut album Spine of God, which displayed fewer metal influences but was psychedelic and <b>sludgy,</b> in the vein of their California peers. Together with these three bands, southern-Californians Fu Manchu, who released their eponymous album in 1994, are credited with being [...] "one of the most enduring and influential bands" [...] of the genre. In 1994, San Francisco's Acid King and Britain's Acrimony released their debut albums, both of which adopted this psychedelic approach to doom metal. Other influential bands from this era include Clutch, Sons of Otis and Corrosion of Conformity.|$|E

60|$|As this ice {{surrounded}} all the Polar land, {{and stretched}} out to sea far {{beyond the reach of}} vision, it followed that there was little or no difference between the winter experience of our discoverers and that of all other Arctic voyagers. This realm of what we may style island-ice stretched away, all round, {{in the direction of the}} Arctic circle, getting thinner and thinner towards its outer margin, until at last it became <b>sludgy,</b> and, finally, melted away into the open sea. This open sea, in its turn, stretched southward, all round, to the known Arctic regions. Thus the Arctic basin was found to be a zone of open water, surrounded by ice on the south, and with a patch of ice and land in its centre.|$|E
60|$|Since the {{discovery}} of Evolution as the method of the Life Force the religion of metaphysical Vitalism has been gaining the definiteness and concreteness needed to make it assimilable by the educated critical man. But {{it has always been}} with us. The popular religions, disgraced by their Opportunist cardinals and bishops, have been kept in credit by canonized saints whose secret was their conception of themselves as the instruments and vehicles of divine power and aspiration: a conception which at moments becomes an actual experience of ecstatic possession by that power. And above and below all have been millions of humble and obscure persons, sometimes totally illiterate, sometimes unconscious of having any religion at all, sometimes believing in their simplicity that the gods and temples and priests of their district stood for their instinctive righteousness, who have kept sweet the tradition that good people follow a light that shines within and above and ahead of them, that bad people care only for themselves, and that the good are saved and blessed and the bad damned and miserable. Protestantism was a movement towards the pursuit of a light called an inner light because every man must see it with his own eyes and not take any priest's word for it or any Church's account of it. In short, there is no question of a new religion, but rather of redistilling the eternal spirit of religion and thus extricating it from the <b>sludgy</b> residue of temporalities and legends that are making belief impossible, though they are the stock-in-trade of all the Churches and all the Schools.|$|E
