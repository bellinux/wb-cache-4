5|$|According to some sources, the Poles resented their {{change of}} {{fortunes}} because, before the war, Poles had a privileged position. Then, {{in the space}} of a few days, Jews and other minorities from within Poland occupied positions in the Soviet occupation government—such as teachers, civil servants and engineers—that they allegedly had trouble achieving under the Polish government. What to the majority of Poles was occupation and betrayal was, to some Jews—especially Polish communists of Jewish descent who emerged from the underground—an opportunity for revolution and retribution. There were even some extreme cases of Jewish participation in massacres of ethnic Poles such as Massacre of Brzostowica Mała. <b>Such</b> <b>behavior</b> affronted non-Jewish Poles.|$|E
5|$|Solid xenon {{changes from}} face-centered cubic (fcc) to {{hexagonal}} close packed (hcp) crystal phase under pressure and begins to turn metallic at about 140GPa, with no noticeable volume change in the hcp phase. It is completely metallic at 155GPa. When metallized, xenon appears sky blue because it absorbs red light and transmits other visible frequencies. <b>Such</b> <b>behavior</b> is unusual for a metal and is explained by the relatively small width of the electron bands in that state.|$|E
5|$|<b>Such</b> <b>behavior</b> {{has been}} witnessed, {{as well as}} {{documented}} from stomach contents, with the American alligators eating such fruit as wild grapes, elderberries, and citrus fruits directly from the trees. The discovery of this unexpected part of the American alligator diet further reveals that American alligators {{may be responsible for}} spreading seeds from the fruit it digests across its habitat. Additionally, American alligators engage in what seems to be cooperative hunting.|$|E

5|$|The chewing of cud by {{animals such as}} cows, goats, and giraffes is {{considered}} normal behavior. These animals are known as ruminants. <b>Such</b> <b>behavior,</b> though termed rumination, {{is not related to}} human rumination syndrome, but is ordinary. Involuntary rumination, similar to what is seen in humans, has been described in gorillas and other primates. True merycism, as opposed to the cud-chewing process in ruminants, is also a normal part of the digestive process in some other animals, such as kangaroos.|$|E
5|$|The olive baboon also {{actively}} hunts prey, {{from small}} rodents and hares to foxes and other primates. Its limit is usually small antelope, such as Thomson's gazelle and also, rarely, sheep, goats, and live chickens, which may amount to 33.5% of its food from hunting. Hunting {{is usually a}} group activity, with {{both males and females}} participating. Interestingly, this systematic predation was apparently developed recently. In a field study, <b>such</b> <b>behavior</b> was observed as starting with the males of one troop and spreading through all ages and sexes.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} amount of new star formation and star destruction data {{is expected to be}} recorded from continued observation of Sakurai's Object, as well as be used as reference data in the future research of similar stars. The reason that stars such as Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae exist, as well as experience a shorter lifespan compared to most stars, is largely unknown. Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae have been observed experiencing born-again behavior for only 10 years, while FG Sagittae has undergone <b>such</b> <b>behavior</b> for 120 years. It is hypothesized that this is due to Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae evolving to the asymptotic giant branch of stars for the first time, while FG Sagittae is undergoing the process a second time.|$|E

There is tremendous variability in <b>such</b> <b>behaviors,</b> although many are practiced with fundamentalist fervor. Such variation exists across individuals, centers, regions, and countries. In addition, endophthalmitis after cataract surgery is relatively rare, thus making it almost impossible for an individual surgeon or even a practice to extrapolate from its own local clinical experience.

40|$|In this paper, {{practical}} stabilization {{problems for}} integrator switched systems are studied. In such class of switched systems, no subsystem has an equilibrium. However, {{the system can}} still exhibit interesting behaviors around a given point under appropriate switching laws. <b>Such</b> <b>behaviors</b> {{are similar to those}} of a conventional stable system near an equilibrium. We introduce some practical stability notions to define <b>such</b> <b>behaviors.</b> In particular, a necessary and sufficient condition for practical stabilizability of such systems is given. Moreover, for practically stabilizable systems, we develop a minimum dwell time switching law which can easily be implemented. Finally, as an application, we apply the switching law to a batch process example. ...|$|R
5|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 2006 Swedish general election, Reinfeldt was {{subjected}} to a smear campaign. Mats Lindström, a staff member in the Social Democratic Party headquarters, admitted to sending e-mails accusing Reinfeldt of tax fraud, false financial declarations and only attaining his position because of his father's influence. The IP address used in the e-mails was traced to the Social Democratic Party headquarters. Social Democratic Party Secretary Marita Ulvskog apologized and said that <b>such</b> <b>behavior</b> was completely unacceptable. A short time after the e-mail campaign, images that depicted Reinfeldt and the Moderate Party in an unflattering light were spread internally within the Social Democratic Party and subsequently leaked to the media. Social Democratic Party spokeswoman Carina Persson confirmed that the material came from the Social Democratic Youth League, but denied the existence of an official smear campaign and stated that the material was not meant to be released or spread to a wider audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{bog turtle}} is {{primarily}} diurnal, active {{during the day}} and sleeping at night. It wakes in the early morning, basks until fully warm, then begins its search for food. It is a seclusive species, making it challenging to observe in its natural habitat. During colder days, the bog turtle will spend much of its time in dense underbrush, underwater, or buried in mud. <b>Such</b> <b>behavior</b> is indicative of the bog turtle's ability to survive without oxygen. On warmer days, the bog turtle's activities include scavenging, mating (during early spring), and basking in sunlight, the last of which it spends {{a great deal of the}} day doing. However, the bog turtle usually takes shelter from the sun during the hottest part of the day. Occasionally, during times of extreme heat, the turtle will either estivate, or become subterranean, sometimes occupying networks of tunnels filled with water. At night, the bog turtle buries itself in soft tunnels.|$|E
5|$|The {{habitat of}} the Mediterranean monk seal {{has changed over}} the years. Prior to the 20th century, Mediterranean monk seals had been known to congregate, give birth, and seek refuge on open beaches. Since sealing had ended, they have left their former habitat and now only use sea caves for <b>such</b> <b>behavior.</b> More often than not, these caves are rather {{inaccessible}} to humans due to underwater entries, and because the caves are often along remote or rugged coastlines. Scientists have confirmed this is a recent adaptation, most likely due to the rapid increase in human population, tourism, and industry, which have caused increased disturbance by humans and the destruction of the species' natural habitat. Because of these seals' shy nature and sensitivity to human disturbance, they have slowly adapted to try to avoid contact with humans completely within the last century, and, perhaps, even earlier. The coastal caves are, however, dangerous for newborns, and are causes of major mortality among pups when sea storms hit the caves.|$|E

Common types of challenging behavior include self-injurious <b>behavior</b> (<b>such</b> as hitting, headbutting, biting), aggressive <b>behavior</b> (<b>such</b> as hitting others, screaming, spitting, kicking, swearing, hairpulling), inappropriate sexualized <b>behavior</b> (<b>such</b> as public masturbation or groping), behavior directed at property (such as throwing objects and stealing) and stereotyped <b>behaviors</b> (<b>such</b> as repetitive rocking, echolalia or elective incontinence). <b>Such</b> <b>behaviors</b> can be assessed to suggest areas of further improvement, using assessment tools such as the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (NCBRF).|$|R

5|$|Themes from Plato and his {{influence}} on Western political philosophy are also {{prevalent in the}} novel. Mainly, {{the debate over the}} nature of 'Good Society' and how to achieve it are seen in the positions of the Supreme. He argues that it is the ruler's role, as well as his duty and obligation, to bring about the good society, and this can only be done by the imposition of absolute order from above. The dictator’s job is to bring about the Good Society, to impose the needed order, and the people's job is to obey the dictator, thereby enjoying the fruits of the good society. The result of <b>such</b> <b>behavior</b> by both the ruler and the ruled will be good for everyone.|$|E
5|$|While most early ornithologists defended Bartram's honesty, Joel Asaph Allen {{argued that}} the painted vulture was mythical and that Bartram mixed {{elements}} of different species to create this bird. Allen {{pointed out that the}} birds' behavior, as recorded by Bartram, is in complete agreement with the caracara's. For example, Bartram observed the birds following wildfires to scavenge for burned insects and box turtles. <b>Such</b> <b>behavior</b> is typical of caracaras, but the larger and shorter-legged king vultures are not well adapted for walking. The northern crested caracara (Caracara cheriway) was believed to be common and conspicuous in Bartram's days, but it is notably absent from Bartram's notes if the painted vulture is accepted as a Sarcoramphus. However, Francis Harper {{argued that the}} bird could, as in the 1930s, have been rare in the area Bartram visited and could have been missed.|$|E
5|$|Divine {{considered}} {{himself to be}} male, and was not transgender or transsexual. He was gay, and during the 1980s had an extended relationship with a married man named Lee, who accompanied him almost everywhere that he went. They later separated, and Divine went on to have a brief affair with gay porn star Leo Ford, which was widely reported upon by the gay press. According to his manager Bernard Jay, Divine regularly engaged in sexual activities with young men that he would meet while on tour, sometimes becoming infatuated with them; in one case, he met {{a young man in}} Israel whom he wanted to bring back to the United States, but was prevented from doing so by Jay. This image of promiscuity was disputed by his friend Anne Cersosimo, who claimed that Divine never exhibited <b>such</b> <b>behavior</b> when on tour. Divine initially avoided informing the media about his sexuality, even when questioned by interviewers, and would sometimes hint that he was bisexual, but {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s changed this attitude and began being open about his homosexuality. Nonetheless, he avoided discussing gay rights, partially at the advice of his manager, realizing that it would have had a negative effect on his career.|$|E
