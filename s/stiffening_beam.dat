The shear wall {{is considered to be}} made up of a finite number of sections in the vertical direction, with or without <b>stiffening</b> <b>beams</b> between each pair of consecutive sections. This method of analysis, which accounts for thickness variation and elastic beam-wall connections, treats the discrete connecting beams as a continuous layered medium. To implement the foregoing analysis a computer program has been developed in the MATHEMATICA computer algebra system.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, free {{vibration}} analysis of plane stiffened coupled shear walls is presented {{based on a}} discrete-continuous approach, where the structure is considered as both a discrete system and a continuous system {{at different stages of}} the analysis. The stiffened system is reinforced by an additional <b>stiffening</b> <b>beam</b> at some level of the structure. This induces additional axial forces, and thus reduces the bending moments in the walls, as well as helping to reduce the lateral deflections and increase the natural frequencies. A method of analysis is derived for investigating the free vibration characteristics of stiffened coupled shear walls. The results of analysis show that the natural frequencies of vibration of coupled shear walls can be significantly increased and the dynamic performance can be improved by the installation of a <b>stiffening</b> <b>beam.</b> The optimal position for the <b>stiffening</b> <b>beam</b> to increase as far as possible the first natural frequency of vibration is also presented. The investigation of effects of foundation flexibilities on both static and dynamic behaviors of stiffened coupled shear walls is carried out by considering foundation flexibilities in rotational, vertical and horizontal directions. The results of parametric investigations indicate that foundation vertical stiffness and rotational stiffness have important effects on both static and dynamic characteristics; while horizontal foundation stiffness has little effect and it is normally ignored in the analysis. Based on the discrete-continuous approach in association with the principle of virtual work, the effect of shear deformations is taken into account on the free vibration analysis of stiffened coupled shear walls. The accuracy of the methodology has been verified by experimental investigations of models and study of a realistic structure. Numerical investigations show that shear effects on the fundamental frequencies of stiffened coupled shear walls are slight but on the higher frequencies are significant. Moreover, it is shown that shear deformation of the structural walls, rather than the connecting beams, is the dominating influence on the free vibration characteristics of stiffened coupled shear wall systems...|$|E

Although the double integration expression in some responses makes the technique infeasible, a practical way to overcome that difficulty is demonstrated using a standard branch-cut integration to eliminate one integration step analytically. The model and numerical scheme readily allow investigation of additional interesting topics, like the passband and stopband characteristic and the mode localization phenomenon that are observed in ribbed structures. Furthermore, an extension to comprehension of the mechanisms that generate the mode localization phenomenon on disordered structures has been realized;A secondary effort examines natural modes of vibration and acoustic radiation for finite <b>stiffened</b> multiple-span <b>beams</b> with the efficient transfer matrix method.

40|$|Based on the {{conventional}} yet accurate continuum approach, a general analysis is presented {{for a pair}} of coupled shear walls, stiffened by an outrigger and a heavy beam in an arbitrary position on the height. Subsequently, a parametric study is presented to investigate the behavior of the structure. The optimum location of the outrigger and the parameters affecting its position were also investigated. The results showed that the behavior of the struc-ture can be significantly influenced by the location of the outrigger. It was also indicated that in most ordinary cases the best location of the structure to minimize top drift is somewhere between 0 · 4 to 0 · 6 of the height of the structure.

40|$|Swelling {{soils are}} a major {{geological}} hazard causing extensive damage to structures world-wide every year. The ultimate aim of this investigation is to study broadly and in depth the stiffened raft foundation {{as one of the}} various foundation alternatives that can be adopted to found a simple and cheap residential building on Sudanese expansive soils, and to make better utilization of its advantages; economical, ease to construct and its ability to withstand rigidly against the anticipated large soil differential heave as a floating foundation. For determining stiffened raft foundation design values the computer program SLAB 2 was applied based on the concept of the rational analysis for solving soil-structure interaction problem. SLAB 2 program necessitated various parameters, structural and soil as a program input data. The structural parameters are mainly from the stiffened raft itself and the load applied on it, while the soil parameters are obtained from the foundation soil. The selected site for this investigation is located at Barakat HQ’s of Elgaziera Scheme {{in the center of the}} clay plains of the Sudan. For studying the behaviour of the supporting expansive soil, various laboratory experiments have been carried out that included the tests for soil engineering index properties, oedometer and unconfined triaxial tests and from them the essential soil parameters were obtained such as the maximum differential heave (ym) and soil Young’s modulus (Es). From soil experiments, it was found that; Barakat expansive soil experienced large heave values. In this study the Post Tensioning Institute (PTI) design method have been assessed. It was found that the contribution of the stiffened raft foundation length (L) and the <b>stiffening</b> <b>beam</b> spacing is not influential in determining the stiffened raft foundation design values; moment, shear and deflection. The heavy perimeter load and the large differential heave at Barakat were found to produce large design values when using SLAB 2 program, while PTI design method produced irrelevant values to what resulted by SLAB 2, particularly when soil differential heave exceeds 100 mm. Also it was found that the stiffened raft design values increase systematically with increasing the underneath soil Young’s modulus (Es). From the comparative analysis that has been made in this study, it was generally found that; PTI design method and some of the other previous existing methods will not eventually suit the highly potential Sudanese expansive soils...|$|E

30|$|Due to superabundant {{usage of}} core wall systems in {{high-rise}} buildings, some researchers such as Emsen et al. (2009) have studied {{on the behavior}} of core wall systems. Their studies focused on the static analysis of non-planar coupled shear walls with any number of <b>stiffening</b> <b>beams.</b> They found that the stiffening of coupled shear walls decreases the maximum displacement at the top and the maximum bending moment {{at the bottom of a}} building. Thus, utilizing such <b>stiffening</b> <b>beams</b> in heights of buildings can be increased more. The stiffening of coupled shear walls can be realized by placing high connecting beams at the levels of whole or partial stories which are used as storage or service areas (Emsen et al. 2009). In addition, the recent study conducted by Mendis (2001) showed that when a substantial torsional moment is present, the magnitude of the longitudinal stresses on the core walls due to warping and the header beam forces is quite significantly high and those actions are too large to be neglected (Mendis 2001). Swaddiwudhipong et al. (2002) demonstrated that the effect of axial deformation should be considered for tall and/or slender buildings. Furthermore, the effect of axial force in columns should be included for structures under high column load, which may occur for buildings with soft stories. This phenomenon could be related to the termination of shear walls in the lower portion of the building (Swaddiwudhipong et al. 2002). In 2009, K.A. Zalka indicated that the interaction between the bending and shear modes is always beneficial, so that it reduces the deflection of the structure (Zalka 2009).|$|R

We further found that irregular rib spacing on the ribbed plate can only localize the group of modes, where the modal response is dominated by coupling of flexural waves in the sub-plates and interfacing beams.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this work}} the {{quasi-static}} response of thermoplastic butt-joint <b>stiffened</b> <b>beam</b> in bending conditions is modeled. In these panels, the stiffener {{is connected to}} the skin by a short-fiber reinforced filler. Although this type of connection performs very well in a pull-off loading (fracture loading is 10 times higher than welded connection), optimization is required regarding its impact performance. The main issue concerning this loading type is the extreme resistance to impact until a certain threshold, upon which the stiffener-skin connection fails in an instable manner, however leaving only barely visible damage on the skin side. Impact tests have been performed on a typical butt joint panel and the main conclusion was that the impact resistance of the butt joint and understanding the impact and post impact behavior is of prime importance. Control of the impact induced damage is therefore crucial for the applicability of such production and connection techniques. This asks for thorough understanding of the mechanism playing a role in deformation, failure initiation and propagation for the combination of materials and production process used.

40|$|Designing {{footbridges}} (pedestrian bridges) {{with the}} deck supported by R/C shells {{is an interesting}} approach, that is illustrated in this paper. The advantage of this structural solution is that R/C shells can be shaped {{in accordance with the}} “minimal surface” criterion. In so doing, the shells are mainly subjected to biaxial compression with membrane stresses. The shape of the minimal surface shells is first studied by suitably choosing the position of the boundary restraints and of the applied forces. Then, through a form-finding process containing an optimisation algorithm, different R/C footbridges with architecturally-valuable shapes are worked out. It is also shown how Maillart’s bridges can be re-shaped {{in order to avoid the}} well known undesired bending effects, even though some tensile stresses may occur. In the case of footbridges having a straight deck, it is shown how: (a) the choice of the position of the deck supports, (b) the shape of the shell close to the abutments, (c) the arrangement of the shell edges along the abutments, and (d) the <b>stiffening</b> <b>beams</b> (if any) along the free edges can minimize the bending effects and improve the behaviour of this type of structures. ...|$|R

Six boundary value problems with respect to the plate transverse deflection, to the plate inplane displacement components, to the beam transverse deflections, to the beam axial deformation and to the beam non-uniform angle of twist are formulated and solved using the analog equation method (AEM), a boundary element method (BEM) based method employing a boundary integral equation approach. The solution of the aforementioned plate and beam problems, which are non-linearly coupled, is achieved using iterative numerical methods. The adopted model describes better the actual response of the plate beams system and permits the evaluation of the shear forces at the interfaces in both directions, the knowledge of which is very important in the design of prefabricated ribbed plates. The evaluated lateral deflections of the plate-beams system are found to exhibit considerable discrepancy from those of other models, which neglect inplane and axial forces and deformations.
