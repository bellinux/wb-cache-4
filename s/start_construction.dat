5|$|The Phase 2 {{budget was}} {{originally}} $1.5 billion, {{which would be}} used to <b>start</b> <b>construction</b> of the tunnels; the MTA reduced the amount of money allocated in the budget, projecting that the agency {{would not be able to}} <b>start</b> <b>construction</b> by the end of the 5-year cycle in 2019. Although the MTA previously expressed concerns about funding the Capital Program, a spokesman stated that the reduction in funding was a result of uncertain timing and not money problems. The delay had upset politicians and residents of East Harlem, who objected to the 3-to-4-year delay.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{stations in}} Russia {{are due to}} be replaced by the Voronezh radar. The Dneprs in Mishelevka, Irkutsk will close once the second array of the new Voronezh radar is operational. The Dnepr at Olenegorsk, Murmansk will be replaced by a Voronezh as well. It is planned to <b>start</b> <b>construction</b> there in 2017.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, still {{frustrated}} {{by the lack of}} activity {{on the part of the}} Railway and Port Company, Hesketh-Fleetwood organised the formation of the Preston and Wyre Railway Company to raise the funds required to bring the railway to Fleetwood. The estimated cost was £122,000. The company obtained Royal assent to <b>start</b> <b>construction,</b> with an underwritten guarantee from Hesketh-Fleetwood. The following year Hesketh-Fleetwood and Burton oversaw the marking out of Fleetwood's first street, and the first railway lines were laid.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} new {{crossings}} have been proposed as relief for the Dartford Crossing. The proposed Thames Gateway Bridge to the west was given planning permission by Transport for London (TfL) in December 2004, but was cancelled in November 2008 when Boris Johnson became Mayor of London. Johnson subsequently proposed the Gallions Reach Ferry, a ferry crossing in the same location, as an alternative. The Lower Thames Crossing is a proposed tunnel to the east between Shorne, Kent and South Ockendon, Essex. Thurrock Council suggest that this crossing will be essential for managing congestion. A public consultation on the scheme ended in March 2016, with the route announced in April 2017, though Highways England {{do not expect to}} <b>start</b> <b>construction</b> before 2026.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{reserves}} of crude oil are non-commercial, Jordan has the 5th largest oil-shale reserves in the world, which could be commercially exploited in the central and northwestern regions of the country. Official figures estimate the kingdom's oil shale reserves at more than 70 billion tonnes. Attarat Power Plant, which will <b>start</b> <b>construction</b> in late 2017, is a $2.2 billion oil shale-dependent power plant that will be completed in 2020 with a total capacity of 470 megawatts. The project {{is part of the}} kingdom's visionary plan that aims to diversify its energy resources by 2025. The extraction of shale oil had been delayed by a couple of years due to: the advanced level of technology that is required for extraction; and the relatively higher cost.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, M.A.C. {{expanded}} its curriculum well beyond agriculture. By 1925 it had expanded enough it {{changed its name}} to Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science (M.S.C.). In 1941, the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, John A. Hannah, became president of the College. He began the largest expansion in the institution's history, {{with the help of the}} 1945 G.I. Bill, which helped World War II veterans to receive an education. One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to <b>start</b> <b>construction</b> on a new dormitory. Under his plan, enrollment increased from 15,000 in 1950 to 38,000 in 1965.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{for rail}} transit have existed since the 1970s, {{following}} the 1965 {{closing of the}} Bergen Tramway. A rapid transit design was first discarded, and in the 1990s a light rail line was proposed. The decision to <b>start</b> <b>construction</b> was made in 2005. The first stage was built by the municipality, with financing {{from the state and}} the toll road ring, based on the Bergen Program. Ownership, maintenance and further extensions and vehicles are the responsibility of Hordaland County Municipality through its wholly owned subsidiary Bybanen AS. Operation is governed by public service obligation contracts issued by the county public transport authority Skyss. From 2010 to 2017 the line and its 20 Variotrams will be operated by Keolis Norge (formerly Fjord1 Partner).|$|E
5|$|The company Sotrasambandet AS {{has been}} {{established}} to lobby for and potentially debt-finance the construction, which potentially could include other parts of National Roads 555 and 561. In 2008, the company estimated {{that it might be}} possible to <b>start</b> <b>construction</b> in 2013, and complete the project by 2016. On 21 April 2009, State Secretary Geir Pollestad stated that the government would support a bridge, but did not indicate if a two-lane or four-lane solution would be chosen. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration has recommended a four-lane bridge, while the Institute of Transport Economics has recommended the two-lane bridge. It is largely up to the city councils of Bergen and Fjell to determine which of the bridge alternatives will be chosen.|$|E
5|$|The largest dams in Russia are the Sayano-Shushenskaya Dam, {{which has}} an {{installed}} capacity of 6,400MW; the Krasnoyarsk Dam (6,000MW); the Bratsk Dam (4,500MW); the Ust-Ilimsk Dam (4,320MW) and the Zeya Dam (1,330MW). Some {{of the most recent}} dam projects are the Bureya Dam (2010MW) and the Irganai Dam (800MW). The Boguchany Dam (1920MW), Zelenchuk Dam (320MW), Zaramag Dam (352MW) and Nizhne-Chereksky (60MW) are currently under construction. RusHydro is the largest hydroelectric company in Russia and the second largest hydroelectric producer in the world. In October 2010, China Yangtze Power, the largest hydropower corporation in China, and EuroSibEnergo, a Russian energy company, signed a cooperation agreement to expand hydroelectric energy production in Russia and export energy to China's northern territories. The West Siberian Generating Company has plans to <b>start</b> <b>construction</b> of eight mini-hydroelectric power plants in the Altai region before 2015.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, {{the down}} became {{the site of}} a major road protest against the {{completion}} of a section of the M3 motorway from London to the south coast of England. There had been plans since the 1970s to replace an earlier 1930s-built bypass of Winchester, which became regularly congested due to design features that had become out of date. This became problematic {{due to the lack of}} available land between Winchester College and St. Catherine's Hill. After several public inquiries, particularly with problems using the water meadows near the college, a route was chosen that took the motorway over the down, ultimately in a cutting. Although protesting against the M3 had been ongoing since the early 1970s, the protest-action on top of the down, described in 1994 as the most controversial British motorway project ever to <b>start</b> <b>construction,</b> attracted a wider group of classes of people than had previously been the case, and included physical violence from onsite security officers.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} the hotel's {{demolition}} started, Raskob had secured all of the investors {{that he needed to}} fund the construction of the building. The plan was to <b>start</b> <b>construction</b> later that year, but on October 24, the New York Stock Exchange started a steep and sudden crash, sparking what would become the decade-long Great Depression. Even so, Raskob refused to cancel the project because of the progress that had been made up to that point. Neither Raskob nor Smith lost much money in the crash: Raskob because he had stopped his speculation about the stock market the previous year, Smith because he had never invested a great amount of money in the market. However, most of their investors did lose money, and as a result, in December of that year, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company loaned Empire State Inc. some $27.5 million so the group could <b>start</b> <b>construction.</b> Even though the stock market crash obviated the need for any new office space, Raskob and Smith proceeded to <b>start</b> <b>construction</b> anyway, since canceling the project would cause investors to incur great losses.|$|E
