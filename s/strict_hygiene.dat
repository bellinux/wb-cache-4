Better canopy management and yield control have led to riper grapes being harvested earlier with more developed tannins in the grape skins. , winemaking for both traditionalist and modernist Barolo producers includes <b>strict</b> <b>hygiene</b> controls and the use of some modern winemaking equipment such as temperature-control fermentation vessels. Rather than fall into one hardline camp or the other, many producers take a middle-ground approach that utilizes some modernist techniques along with traditional winemaking. In general, the traditional approach to Nebbiolo involves long maceration periods of 20 to 30 days and the use of older large botti-size barrels. The modern approach to Nebbiolo utilizes shorter maceration periods of 7 to 10 days and cooler fermentation temperatures between 82-86°F (28-30°C) that preserve fruit flavors and aromas. Towards the end of the fermentation period, the cellars are often heated to encourage the start of malolactic fermentation which softens some of Nebbiolo's harsh acidity. Modern winemakers tend to favor smaller barrels of new oak that need only a couple years to soften the tannic grip of the wines. While new oak imparts notes of vanilla, it has the potential to cover up the characteristic rose notes of Nebbiolo.|$|E

Another study showed that, in Guinea, a satisfactory knowledge had not altered the level of comprehensive knowledge about the virus. As a consequence, the high level of misinterpretation was responsible for a low comprehensive knowledge about the virus; 82% of individuals believed that Ebola was the result of a virus (36.2% thought that a higher power had caused it).

40|$|Abstract Background Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{is one of}} {{the leading}} strains among multiresistant {{hospital}} microflora. In 2003, we noted an increase in the number of MRSA strain 35 among patients at the University of Zurich, Department of Dermatology. At the end of 2003, we implemented additional policies in hospital hygiene, which significantly decreased the number of MRSA infections. Methods This is a retrospective study on 65 consecutive patients at the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital of Zurich, in whom MRSA contamination was newly diagnosed during the period of 2003 - 2008. All isolated strains were genotyped. We implemented additional policies as <b>strict</b> hand <b>hygiene</b> and avoidance of sharing the same ointment pots or tubes amongst patients. As soon as the skin disease was healed, decolonization of MRSA was undertaken by a 5 -day topical treatment. Results Of the 65 MRSA patients, 19 (29 %) patients carried a genotypical strain (MRSA 35) that was identified to be specific for the Department of Dermatology. Three health care workers (HCWs) were tested positive. The outlined measures reduced the incidence of new transmissions of this specific strain MRSA 35 significantly (P = 0. 001) with a complete disappearance of new transmissions of MRSA 35 in the year 2008. Of the 65 patients, 15 (23 %) patients became long-term carriers, among all (15 / 15; 100 %) had persisting active skin lesions. Conclusions <b>Strict</b> hand <b>hygiene</b> and avoidance of sharing ointments among patients were highly effective measures in controlling an outbreak of MRSA. Complete of near-to-complete remission of the underlying dermatoses, skin lesions or chronic wounds, is a prerequisite for complete decolonization of MRSA carriers...|$|R
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Processamento e Conservação de Alimentos - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaFood safety {{consumer}} concern is increasing, {{which led to}} the implementation of <b>stricter</b> <b>hygiene</b> rules which are applicable to animal products. In this scenario, slaughterhouses and sanitary inspection plays a critical role, since they allow to identify and minimize the specific hazards for human health. Through the assurance of animal well-being and through the ante and post-mortem inspection, it is possible to guarantee that products of animal origin reach the consumer in a safe way. Mainly goals of this thesis were the classification and quantification of the animal origin by-products obtained during health inspection and slaughter operations, as well as the assessment of the economic impact of these products for the slaughterhouse. A record was made for the weights of the by-products obtained monthly through the slaughtered species in Mafra´s Regional Slaughterhouse, bovine, equine, ovine and caprine, during the internship period from February to July 2015. During this period, it was possible to determine that, from the by-products produced over these months, more than 50 % were of category 3 by-products. The amount of category 1 by-products produced varied between 31 000 kg and 45 000 kg, the amount of category 2 by-products varied between 28 000 kg and 36 000 kg and the amount of category 3 by-products varied between 67 000 kg and 86 000 kg. Economically, despite of animal origin by-products being considered just a “complementary” service, the income of category 3 by-products generates a value of 41 709 € which covers the cost associated with the elimination of category 1 and 2 by-products (37 517 €) ...|$|R
