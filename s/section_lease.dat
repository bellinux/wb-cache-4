5000|$|With Weisfield's {{continuing}} {{to own the}} properties that Fred Meyer leased, this kept grocery <b>sections</b> <b>leased</b> to Associated Grocers (where Valu-Mart had a grocery section within the store). Most were converted into Mark-it Foods. A no frills discount store popular in the 1970s that allowed the customers to mark their own prices with a grease pencil as well as bag their own groceries. Stores also contained automotive repair sections which served as Good Year Tire Stores as well. The restaurants and beauty salons continued to keep their leases and operate as independent businesses that operated within the stores even after the Fred Meyer conversion (until Kroger acquired Fred Meyer and purchased the Valu-Mart properties). Some of the restaurants were converted to Eve's (Fred Meyer's dining brand) after the conversion. Some food departments were leased to Fred Meyer later on as remodeling happened in the late 1970s (with {{the exception of the}} Burien and Greenwood locations).|$|R

50|$|Rockhampton's {{citizens}} first petitioned their Council for {{the establishment}} of a market in 1870. Land bounded by East, Bolsover and William Streets was designated a Market Reserve the following year. As the Council then lacked the funds to erect a suitable building, <b>sections</b> were <b>leased</b> for a period of fifteen years. Conditions applied to the type of construction allowed. In this manner it was envisaged that suitable buildings would be erected, while a fund for further development accrued.|$|R

50|$|The company {{drastically}} {{changed its}} business model around 1993. Instead of stocking the merchandise itself near airports, Skymall began <b>leasing</b> <b>sections</b> of the magazines to various distributors which customers would then order from directly.

50|$|In 2001, the Mangakino Township Incorporation {{obtained}} approval {{through the}} Māori Land Court to legally change {{the title of}} the majority of residential sections in Mangakino from Maori land to General title. They then put Mangakino’s 500+ leasehold sections on the market as a single purchase. In July 2002, the majority of the town’s sections were sold to MV Properties of Pukekohe. A stipulation of the tender was that residents would be given the first opportunity to purchase their perpetually <b>leased</b> <b>sections.</b> The land valuations that had been exceedingly low for decades, then skyrocketed. Some locals chose to freehold their homes immediately, empty <b>sections</b> without current <b>leases</b> were sold on the open market. Many residents continue to remain perpetual leaseholders.|$|R

50|$|In 1947 {{all three}} {{remaining}} steam locomotives were unusable and the railway was moribund. The locomotives were cut up at Snailbeach in 1950. The lower <b>section</b> was <b>leased</b> by Shropshire County Council who {{used it to}} transport road-building materials from Callow Hill Quarry to Pontesbury. When the last steam locomotive failed, loaded wagons were run from the quarry to Pontesbury by gravity, and then, when enough were ready, hauled back using a Fordson tractor straddling the rails. The railway finally closed in 1959, the last railway equipment being scrapped in 1961. The Talyllyn Railway purchased the remaining track.|$|R

The middle of the park is a non-vehicle area (The Walking Dunes), and the southernmost <b>section</b> is <b>leased</b> to the Mac Wood's Dune Rides for scenic dune cruising with spectacular views of Lake Michigan and Silver Lake.|$|R
5000|$|After {{failing to}} attract {{sufficient}} private buyers on time, the residential <b>section</b> was <b>leased</b> to the London Borough of Camden {{for use as}} council housing, while the developer retained ownership of the structure and shopping areas. [...] The exterior of the building was never painted because the Borough {{could not afford to}} complete work on the building after they took control. In Hodgkinson's design, the blocks would have been painted cream, a shade typical of the Georgian period, as a homage to the terraced houses that previously stood on the site and those that still surround it.|$|R

5000|$|In 1973, Fred Meyer {{acquired}} {{all five}} Oregon stores of the Valu-Mart discount chain (formerly known as Villa-Mart in Oregon) from its parent company, Seattle-based Weisfield's, Inc. [...] The following year, Weisfield's leased its remaining stores (renamed [...] "Leslie's"), in 1975 [...] According {{to an article}} published in the business section of The Seattle Times on August 10, 1975, Fred Meyer signed long-term leases with most of the 21 Weisfield's-owned stores (Tacoma and Everett locations were not acquired). Some of the properties may have been purchased by Fred Meyer at the time in the Oregon market but Weisfield's maintained existing leases on properties in the Seattle/Tacoma market since leases for the grocery <b>sections</b> (<b>leased</b> to Associated Grocers in 1973) and other smaller businesses within the stores were kept. Kroger acquired these properties from Weisfield's during the 1990s and 2000s. Some of these properties such as the Greenwood and Midway locations were demolished to rebuild the locations. In 1975, Fred Meyer opened its first stores in Alaska as a result of acquiring Leslie's/Valu-Mart, and changed the Leslie's/Valu-Mart stores to the Fred Meyer banner. As Fred Meyer became better known in the Seattle area, the Marketime Drug chain became known as Fred Meyer-Marketime. While Fred Meyer was building new stores in Washington state some smaller discount stores in the state would lease a portion of their stores to Fred Meyer as well such as The Hi-Ho Shopping Center in Puyallup and the Yard Birds Shopping Center in Centralia.|$|R
2500|$|From 1920 onward it {{was owned}} by the Grace Brothers retail company, and several <b>sections</b> were <b>leased</b> out as shops or accommodation. For many years the shopfront on the {{northern}} {{side of the building}} housed Maurice's Lebanese Restaurant, commemorated in John Kennedy's [...] "On King St, I'm A King". The building was purchased by Moore Theological College in 1974, and from 1981 to 1994 it housed the Con Dellis used furniture store, but all occupation ceased after that time. Fortunately, a sympathetic restoration program during 2005–06 by Moore College has returned this outstanding 19th-century building, including its elaborate Flemish-style facade, to its former glory.|$|R

5000|$|Although Allentown has {{not seen}} a {{property}} tax increase during Pawlowski's terms, the administration's fiscal responsibility has come into question. under Mayor Pawlowski's tenure in late 2012, Allentown's bond rating was downgraded to an A3 with a [...] "negative outlook." [...] In 2012, he addressed a police pension fund crisis by offering a controversial solution (see controversies <b>section)</b> of <b>leasing</b> the city's publicly owned water and sewer systems {{for a period of}} 50 years.

50|$|Unlike the {{original}} branch in Buckingham County, the new <b>section</b> is <b>leased</b> for a 20-year period. CSX retains overhead trackage rights on the trackage leased to the Buckingham Branch, and continues its same pattern of running empty westbound coal and grain trains over the route, sometimes {{as many as}} 8 a day. Buckingham Branch train crews must contend with this fact by continually dodging the CSX westbounds, {{as well as the}} Amtrak trains, by going into the various sidings along the lines. Amtrak's Cardinal continues to use the Buckingham Branch line between Orange and Clifton Forge on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays, the only instance where an Amtrak train utilizes a Class III railway line.|$|R

2500|$|In New York City, the New York City Housing Authority, {{which is}} not a {{legislature}} but rather a city government authority which provides affordable housing for low- and moderate-income residents and administers a citywide government-legislature-approved <b>Section</b> 8 <b>Leased</b> Housing Program, in May 2009 prohibited residents of the [...] Authority from owning the following dog breeds: Akita Inu, Alangu Mastiff, Alano Español, American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, Argentine Dogo, Bedlington Terrier, Boston Terrier, Bull and Terrier, Bull Terrier, Bully Kutta, Cane Corso, Dogue de Bordeaux, Dogo Sardesco, English Mastiff, Fila Brasileiro, Gull Dong, Gull Terr, Irish Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Korean Jindo Dog, Lottatore Brindisino, Neapolitan Mastiff, Perro de Presa Canario, Perro de Presa Mallorquin, Shar Pei, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Tosa Inu.|$|R
50|$|The {{story of}} Penryn begins in late 1864 when a Welsh {{immigrant}} {{by the name}} of Griffith Griffith established a granite quarry on quarter <b>section</b> of land <b>leased</b> from the Central Pacific Railroad. A siding was completed on February 6, 1865, and the first load of cut stone was shipped less than a week later. The quarry was open for business, but as yet, had no name. The railroad, matter-of-factly, designated the siding “Griffith’s Granite Station,” but Griffith had something else in mind.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the mine}} {{remained}} financially viable {{and continued to}} provide employment to the workers, {{by the time of}} the buyout the only seam worked at Tower was the Seven Feet/Five Feet, a combined seam of several leaves which offered 1.3m of anthracite in a mined section of 1.65m. Working directly under the shaft of the former Glyncorrwg Colliery's [...] "nine feet" [...] workings, the four faces worked in the western <b>section</b> of the <b>lease</b> were considered uneconomic by British Coal.|$|R
5000|$|In those days, railroads {{were often}} built in {{sections}} using different contractors and money sometimes ran {{out before the}} line was tied together. This happened to the [...] narrow gauge Cheraw and Chester. In 1879, it made it the 22 mi from Chester County to the Catawba River but did not cross it. On the other end, rail was laid from Cheraw to Pageland before the capital was exhausted in that direction. It operated for three years in these sections before being split. The Chester <b>section</b> was <b>leased</b> to the Charlotte, Columbia and Augusta Railroad who built a wooden bridge across the Catawba and extended the track one mile (1.6 km) beyond Lancaster in 1883. It was then leased to the Richmond and Danville Railroad, which in turn went into receivership. Meanwhile, the line from Cheraw to Pageland became the Chesterfield and Lancaster Railroad but never extended any further.|$|R
50|$|Water is {{supplied}} to Lake Hico by a five mile long pipeline from the Pearl River. Lake Hico is the headwater of Eubanks Creek, {{a tributary of}} the Pearl. Hico is an abbreviation for Hinds County, the county in which the lake is situated.

The <b>lease</b> is overseen by Mississippi's Secretary of State, Entergy pays $258,000 per year for Lake Hico.|$|R
5000|$|After {{successfully}} opening smaller suburban locations, Miller & Rhoads set its {{sights on}} large stores in regional malls. However, its {{first attempt at}} a larger store in the suburban Richmond market was thwarted because of a clause in a lease on an existing location. Because of a <b>section</b> in their <b>lease</b> at Southside Plaza that prevented additional locations within five miles of that shopping center, Miller & Rhoads was unable to be an anchor at Cloverleaf Mall, Richmond’s first large regional mall, which was only four miles away.|$|R
25|$|During {{the early}} 1930s, the Company {{considered}} enlarging the navigation above Nottingham, {{in conjunction with}} improvements to the River Soar Navigation, between Trent Lock and Leicester. There were also negotiations with the London and North Eastern Railway, who {{were responsible for the}} Nottingham Canal between Trent Lock and Lenton. Plans for new larger locks at Beeston and Wilford were abandoned when the Trent Catchment Board opposed them. The Grand Union refused to improve the Soar Navigation, because the Trent Navigation Company could not guarantee 135,000 tons of additional traffic. The Company also considered a plan to reopen the river to Burton, which would have involved the rebuilding of Kings Mills lock, and the construction of four new locks. An extra set of gates were added to Cromwell lock in 1935, effectively creating a second lock, while the Lenton to Trent Lock <b>section</b> was <b>leased</b> from the LNER in 1936, and ultimately purchased in 1946.|$|R
