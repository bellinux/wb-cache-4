5000|$|Over {{the course}} of U.S. history, federal {{holidays}} were created and then abolished over time as their <b>significance</b> <b>waned.</b> Two holidays, the Eighth and Victory Day, were once celebrated. Between 1828 and 1861, [...] "The Eighth" [...] was a holiday that marked the U.S. victory in the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815, with Tennessee's Andrew Jackson leading a successful battle against regular British soldiers and freed slaves. Following Jackson's election as President, the day earned official national recognition. The Eighth continued as an official national holiday from 1828 until {{the advent of the}} Civil War. Victory Day marked the [...] "Victory over Japan" [...] and remained a national holiday until 1975. While both holidays remain largely forgotten by the American public, the U.S. state of Rhode Island still officially observes Victory Day, with public offices and schools being closed.|$|E
5000|$|Marwan later {{changed the}} {{succession}} order agreed to at Jabiyah by designating {{his own son}} Abd al-Malik as his heir. During the latter's reign (685-705), Jabiyah was often used by the caliph as a month-long resort in the spring on his return to Damascus from his winter resort at al-Sinnabra on Lake Tiberias. It was at Jabiyah that Abd al-Malik decreed that his sons al-Walid I and Sulayman should succeed him as caliph. Lammens and Shahid both described this as [...] "the last great political event" [...] that occurred in Jabiyah. During Caliph Sulayman's reign (715-717), Jabiyah's role declined as the main Syrian military camp was shifted north to Dabiq near the Arab-Byzantine frontier. Nonetheless, Jabiyah remained {{the center of a}} district within Jund Dimashq. Its <b>significance</b> <b>waned</b> further with the rise of the Baghdad-based Abbasid Caliphate in 750.|$|E

It opened in 1877 between Girvan and Challoch Junction, where it joined the Portpatrick Railway, {{which had already}} reached Stranraer from Castle Douglas. Portpatrick had been an {{important}} ferry terminal for traffic {{to and from the}} north of Ireland, but its <b>significance</b> was <b>waning</b> and Stranraer assumed greater importance.

Ohum is the time to thank the fetish and show appreciation for the abundant harvest as well as to ask the fetish for more of such harvest. Although Ohum marks the beginning of the harvest season and epitomizes the traditional beliefs of the people, its <b>significance</b> began <b>waning</b> with the advent of Christianity in Mampong.|$|R

40|$|Originally a Christian festival to {{celebrate}} the birth of Jesus Christ, Christmas is now a major secular festival celebrated in numerous Christian and non-Christian countries. It is also a major holiday period that from a destination perspective offers an opportunity to attract significant numbers of visitors. The aim {{of this paper is}} to explore issues related to developing a Christmas-themed holiday product in a destination that has not previously used the festive nature of Christmas as a major destination pull factor. This paper finds that while its religious <b>significance</b> has <b>waned,</b> the celebration of Christmas remains an important tradition reflected in the expectation that Christmas symbols and activities are present at holiday destinations. The paper also finds that the development of a Christmas product needs to include an authentic "Christmas feel" that is able to be created by street and shop decorations such as Christmas lights and trees, nativity scenes and Santa Claus, as well as Christmas carols and the availability of special foods associated with Christmas...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to explain the effect of {{government}} agricultural support payments on farmland rental prices. The regression specified farmland rental prices as a function of farm income (net of government payments received), and direct government agricultural support payments. The regression was estimated using seemingly unrelated regression for the years 2002, 2007, and 2012. Our results show the effect of government agricultural support payments on farmland rental prices was significant in 2002, then became insignificant for 2007 and 2012. We conclude the <b>waning</b> <b>significance</b> was caused by a change in the format of government support payments from a known value, activity-based payment, to a variable value, insurance payment...|$|R
40|$|The present article {{endeavors to}} examine {{narratives}} of virginity {{as they have}} been viewed by some contemporary literary trends and to conceptualize, articulate and interpret oral testimonies elicited from Greek-Australian women across three generations. These oral testimonies encompassed and redefined a view of virginity - and the sequence of three intergenerational women affirms that its <b>significance</b> is <b>waning</b> - as a gradual evolution, transformation or even rejection of the concept. In literature, virginity has been presented antithetically as both anatomical and ideological, real and imagined, private and social/public, prestigious and as an obstacle, sacred and profance as well as a commodity and artifact. Oral testimonies, on the other hand, have the ability to reveal hidden realities of the individual self and to incorporate a novel variety of experiences and perspectives to this subject matter. As an epithet the word "virgin" means the unknown, the unattached, the unspoiled and the pure; as a noun "virginity" means an intact hymen and the absence of sexual intercourse between male and female. In this article the discussion is limited to this framework and won't extend to other connotations and subdivisions of the term. 22 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|The Company's {{next step}} was to bring in Chinese {{migrants}} to work the land. It resorted to bringing in foreign workers for the purpose because it felt that [...] "the productive and industrial value of the alien races is... far greater than that of the natives of Borneo... {{it will be a very}} long time before the natives become, individually, as valuable assets to the State as the alien races". In 1882, the then Governor of North Borneo, William Crocker, requested the help of Walter Medhurst, who had just been appointed as immigration commissioner in China, to send Chinese migrants to British North Borneo. Medhurst offered free passage to British North Borneo to any Chinese people interested in seeking employment there. Most of these migrants disembarked and settled in Kudat and Sandakan, which were then the largest towns in the colony. By the time Medhurst returned to the United Kingdom in 1885, 348 of the 937 residents of Kudat were Chinese. Of these, 222 worked as shopkeepers. During this time, Kudat's <b>significance</b> had <b>waned</b> significantly as the Company moved the capital of British North Borneo to Sandakan. However, Chinese migration to Kudat continued, albeit at a slower pace.|$|R
50|$|Preslav regained {{some of its}} {{importance}} in Bulgarian politics during {{the first years of}} the joint rule of the founders of the Second Bulgarian Empire, Peter IV of Bulgaria and Ivan Asen I. Apparently, Ivan Asen ruled from the centre of the uprising, Tarnovgrad, whereas his brother and co-ruler Theodore Peter resided in Preslav as a symbol of the renewed statehood of Bulgaria. The strategic advantages of Tarnovgrad were, however, decisive in the long run and the <b>significance</b> of Preslav <b>waned</b> in the course of the 13th century. The Tatar raids during the 1270s drove away the last citizens of Preslav, along with the protothroned bishop of the city. Some of the surviving refugees built up a village of the same name only two kilometres north from the fortress where the contemporary town of Veliki Preslav is now situated.|$|R

This article discusses contemporary handmade film-making as a form of critical practice that is now developing within the context of celluloid obsolescence and the frequent proclamations about the <b>waning</b> <b>significance</b> of film in the digital era. Because of its engagement with the materiality of film, artisanal film-making offers itself as a form of metacinematic reflection - film reflecting on the possibility and meaning of its own disappearance and the eventuality of its survival. Hence, in the films described below, to work with celluloid is to go beyond `analogue nostalgia' in a restrictive, fetishistic sense, and to focus instead on the significance and topicality of the specific creative process that artisanal film-making entails. We argue that, whilst these films continue a structural-materialist tradition of experimental cinema, they reframe and renew materialist practice by engaging with wider themes of technological and cultural obsolescence.

5000|$|By 28 March 1497, Ferdinand and Isabella were {{convinced}} that Perkin Warbeck's <b>significance</b> was <b>waning</b> and war between England and Scotland must be avoided. Dr Puebla, in London, was instructed to placate Henry VII who had heard that Ayala was credulous in believing the Scottish account of the situation. The chronicler George Buchanan mentions Ayala's negotiation at Jedburgh with Richard Foxe, Bishop of Durham and keeper of Norham Castle representing Henry VII. John Lesley says this first discussion with Foxe was held at Melrose Abbey. A second instruction to Foxe mentioned his previous meeting at 'Jenyn Haugh.' James IV still refused to hand Perkin, his guest, to the English. Henry VII considered the offers made at Jenyn Haugh by the Earl of Angus and Lord Home as inadequate and asked the Bishop of Durham to press James IV to surrender Perkin before negotiations for peace commenced. John Lesley, writing in the 1570s, gave a useful summary of Ayala's activity and Spanish intent to this point, quoted as his 16th-century translator put it;"Quhen Ferdinand king of Hispanie harde of sik trubles betwene thir twa kingis, quhom he lovet sa weil, he labouris quhat he can to sett thame at ane, and mak thame gude freindis. Quairfor he directes to Scotland an ambassatour Petre Hiela, a singular man in pietie, cunning, prudent and wise, to persuade the Scotis king peace and concord be al meines possible. Quhen partelie the Scotis king was inclyne, and Ferdinand had a gude hope of his good wil, he sendes to king Henrie of Ingland, that he shortlie send an ambassadour to Scotland, for {{the conclusion of the}} peace." [...] Soon after this meeting, James relented, and Perkin Warbeck finally left Scotland around 7 July, and it may be a measure of Ayala's success that Perkin sailed under-equipped in a recently impounded French ship called the Cuckoo, captained according to James by a reluctant hired Breton called Guy Foulcart.|$|R
40|$|Hungary’s {{external}} balance indicators improved {{a great deal}} in 2007. Simultaneously, however, the external debt ratio also rose which, in an international climate of uncertainty stemming from the sub-prime crisis, drew investors’ attention to the structure of the country’s external financing. This study argues that the recent increase in debt-creating external financing does not necessarily increase risks associated with sustainability. On the one hand, the record rise in debt-creating financing in 2007 is largely due to one-off items. On the other hand, the <b>waning</b> <b>significance</b> of non-debt-creating financing is not attributable to declining inflows but rather mostly to residents’ stepped up capital exports, which is partly a result of the development in the institutional investor sector, and partly of the foreign expansion of a few large resident companies. The picture becomes even more intricate as according to recent research, the advantages generally associated with non-debt-creating financing are not always supported by findings, and empirical experience indicates that more developed countries are often characterised by a higher share of debt-type external liabilities. Naturally, and irrespectively of the structure of financing, Hungary’s high level of net foreign liabilities in an international comparison continues to be a strong risk factor. foreign direct investment, portfolio shares, structure of external financing, debt-creating and non-debt-creating financing. ...|$|R
