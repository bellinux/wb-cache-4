25|$|During reincarnation {{consciousness}} {{tries to}} liberate {{itself from the}} burden of collected impressions. Yet, since it tries to achieve this by associating itself with impressions opposite from the previously accumulated ones, it gets further entangled in accumulating fresh impressions. Thus the soul experiences itself in a seemingly endless succession of human lives, as {{a man or a}} woman, as rich or poor, strong or weak, beautiful or ugly, black or white, in various places, religions, castes etc. It is only after numerous apparent births and deaths, that the range of human experience <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> exhausted. In this way the soul starts dissociating itself from the gross world, enabling its consciousness to become aware of the subtle sphere.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{recurring}} storylines involves Garfield getting lost or running away. The longest {{one of these}} lasted for over a month (in 1986 August 25 to September 28); it began with Jon telling Garfield to go get the newspaper. Garfield walks outside to get it, but speculates {{about what will happen}} if he wanders off – and decides to find out. Jon notices Garfield has been gone too long, so he sends Odie out to find him. He quickly realizes his mistake (Odie, being not too bright, also gets lost). Jon <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> lonely, so he offers a reward for the return of Garfield and Odie. He is not descriptive, so animals including an elephant, monkeys, a seal, a snake, a kangaroo and joey, and turtles are brought to Jon's house for the reward. After a series of events, including Odie being adopted by a small girl, both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined, and both going to a pet shop, Garfield and Odie make it back home.|$|E

500|$|Following this interchange, {{the freeway}} becomes six lanes, with three in each {{direction}} as it continues into more wooded areas and reaching an exit with access to US46 and US202/CR511. In this area, the highway runs {{to the west of}} the Jersey City Reservoir and immediately to the east of US202/CR511. I-287 comes to the Intervale Road exit, which carries US202 and CR511. The freeway enters Boonton, where it turns northeast, with New Jersey Transit's Montclair-Boonton Line located a short distance to the northwest. In Boonton, there is another interchange with US202/CR511. From here, I-287 curves more to the east, with US202 running immediately to the north of the road. Along this stretch, there is an exit for US202 and Vreeland Avenue. Upon entering Montville, the freeway draws away from US202 as it passes near wooded residential areas before coming to another interchange with US202. I-287 continues northeast from this point, crossing under New Jersey Transit's Montclair-Boonton Line before running north-northeast through more woodland as the terrain <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> more mountainous. The freeway runs through Kinnelon, where the northbound direction has four lanes, and Pequannock Township before entering Riverdale. In Riverdale, there is an interchange with Route23.

2500|$|The Aviators {{opened their}} {{season with a}} four-game series against the Orange County Breakers, who were {{returning}} to Southern California after playing the previous two seasons as the Austin Aces. When the Breakers last called Orange County their home in 2013, the Aviators had not yet moved to California and were known as the New York Sportimes. While the teams {{did not have any}} history as geographic rivals, the franchises did meet in the 2005 WTT Finals with the Sportimes earning the title with a 21–18 victory over the Newport Beach Breakers. The two franchises also boasted the best regular-season records in WTT over the past two seasons with the Aviators achieving the feat in 2014, and the Aces doing so in 2015.

2500|$|To {{perform the}} [...] "dismount to mount" [...] exchange, the first rider must exit {{the pack and}} coast for about 15 meters in order to slow down. Then the rider on the bike will soft pedal until the right foot is back and level with the left foot in the front. Once the feet are set, the rider will then forcefully pedal backwards. Because the Little 500 Bikes are coaster brakes, this action causes the bike's wheels to stop dead and forces the bike to skid along the cinder track. During this skid, the rider on the bike will take her left foot off the pedal and swing {{it over to the}} right side. Then the left foot will come behind the right and hit the ground, soon {{followed}} by the right foot. This rider will still be running once off the bike and hand it off to the next rider. This is where many riders differ. Some mount the bike by crossing their left foot over and stepping on the left petal and then swinging their right foot over the bike. But more commonly, riders will run and then literally jump onto the bike seat. Both types have their advantages. The step on style can be very slow (if performed incorrectly) and impossible to perform if the pedals are not set properly by the first rider. But it is far less painful for the rider and much more reliable. On the other hand, jumping on the bike guarantees that the rider will get on the bike, and, when performed correctly, is faster than stepping on, but it can be very painful for most riders and often the initial shock of landing causes a momentary delay before the rider <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up to speed. This delay can cost crucial seconds when it comes to catching the pack. Also, for men there is the possibility of permanent damage to their reproductive organs. And many women suffer from vaginal bruising. Jumping on is also more dangerous because if performed improperly, riders are likely to take very hard falls.|$|E
