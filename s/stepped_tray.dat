To Hamilton, her eight-room home felt like a piece of France, scooped up and replanted in the Emerald Hill countryside. The home had a brick façade, with Palladian windows, and a gravel drive leading up to the front door. It was expansive with noble proportions and high, <b>stepped</b> <b>tray</b> ceilings that she designed herself in the wide, one-story [...] "Chartreuse" [...] style, common in southern France.|$|E

The concept of integrating the stepped solar still along with inclined flat plate collector is introduced in this research work. In this stepped type solar still, a conventional basin of area 1 m 2, was placed at the bottom. Another absorber plate, stepped type was fixed {{on the top of}} the conventional basin. It consists of subsequent trays and inclined flat plate collectors. This ensures an additional exposure area which augments the evaporation rate. Experiments were conducted with various depths in the conventional basin. A conventional still was fabricated and run parallel with the experimental set up for comparison. Sensible heat storage mediums such as rocks, pebbles were added to the top basin of <b>stepped</b> <b>trays</b> and bottom conventional basins to increase the temperature of water in the still. Wicks were placed on the inclined flat plate collector to augment the evaporation rate due to capillarity. A higher evaporation rate is obtained in the packing material with wicks and pebbles in tray combinations. Theoretical analysis was performed and it agrees with experimental values. Efficiency of the system was also compared with conventional solar still...|$|R

It was a merry sight and a {{pleasant}} one. The day was warm and balmy, and the yellow sunlight fell in waving uncertain patches of light, dappling the table-cloth, and twinkling and sparkling upon the dishes, cups, and flagons.|$|R

Primero, se nos ofrece una visión sobre la genealogí­a desde la manera en que Foucault la percibe en Nietzsche; después, se muestra que la tarea suprema de la genealogí­a es la genealogí­a del humanismo; en un tercer momento, se nos sugiere que esa genealogí­a del humanismo se despliega en la interpretación heideggeriana de Nietzsche; y, finalmente, el autor se propone entender, en relación con esa genealogí­a del humanismo, el debate sobre el humanismo originado por el filósofo alemán Peter Sloterdijk en 1999 "Ultrahumanisms?"In this {{articles}} {{the author}} research about the genealogy of the humanism.

High-throughput automatic classification of protein crystals requires to alleviation of the time-consuming task of manual visual inspection. We propose a classification framework {{combined with a}} multi-scale image processing method for recognizing protein crystals and precipitates versus clear drops. The main two points of the processing method are the multi-scale Laplacian pyramid filters and histogram analysis techniques to find an effective feature vector. The processing <b>steps</b> include: 1. <b>Tray</b> well cropping using Radon Transform; 2. Droplet cropping using an ellipsoid Hough Transform; 3. Multi-scale image separation with Laplacian pyramidal filters; 4. Feature vector extraction from the histogram of the multi-scale boundary images. The feature vector combines geometric and texture features of each image and provides input to a feed forward binomial neural network classifier. Using human (expert crystallographers) classified images as ground truth, the current experimental results gave 86 % true positive and 94 % true negative rates (average true percentage is 90 %) using an image database which contained over 2, 000 images. To enable NESG collaborators to carry our crystal classification, a web-based Matlab © server was also developed. Users at other locations on the internet can input micro-array crystal image folders and parameters for training and testing processes through a friendly web interface. Recognition results are shown on the client side website and may be downloaded by a remote user as an Excel © spreadsheet file...|$|R
