50|$|Stoke City {{entered the}} 1990-91 {{season in the}} Third Division {{for only the second}} time in their history and the feeling from the {{supporters}} was that a club of Stoke's size <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to <b>easily</b> <b>gain</b> an instant return to the second tier. However Stoke experienced their worst ever season in terms of league position as they could only muster a 14th place finish. Alan Ball was sacked in February and his assistant Graham Paddon took over for the remainder of the season.|$|R

40|$|Correlation {{analysis}} {{is a basic}} problem {{in the field of}} data stream mining. In this paper we propose a new method based on Boolean representation for lag correlation analysis among multiple data streams. The raw stream sequence is transformed into the Boolean sequence, and the lags in any correlation pairs of sequences can <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> <b>gained</b> by simple bit operations. Compared with pair-wise approach, this proposed method can get the exact result more efficiently by reducing huge calculation in very limited space. Both the theory analysis and the experimental evaluations show that this method has great computation complexity with high accuracy...|$|R
