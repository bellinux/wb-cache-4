5|$|Over 3 million {{vessels are}} {{employed}} in sea fishing. Modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers with a small crew, stern trawlers, purse <b>seiners,</b> long-line factory vessels, and large factory ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets, and long-lines. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide food security to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty.|$|E
25|$|Seine netters - {{the basic}} types of seine netters are the anchor <b>seiners</b> and Scottish seiner in {{northern}} Europe and the Asian <b>seiners</b> in Asia.|$|E

25|$|Scottish <b>seiners</b> are {{basically}} configured {{the same as}} anchor <b>seiners.</b> The only difference is that, whereas the anchor seiner has the coiler and winch mounted transversally amidships, the Scottish seiner has them mounted transversally in the forward part of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|Anchor <b>seiners</b> {{have the}} {{wheelhouse}} and accommodation aft {{and the working}} deck amidships, thus resembling side trawlers. The seine net is stored and shot from the stern, and they may carry a power block. Anchor <b>seiners</b> have the coiler and winch mounted transversally amidships.|$|E
25|$|Purse <b>seiners</b> {{are very}} {{effective}} at targeting aggregating pelagic species near the surface. The seiner circles the shoal {{with a deep}} curtain of netting, possibly using bow thrusters for better manoeuvrability. Then {{the bottom of the}} net is pursed (closed) underneath the fish shoal by hauling a wire running from the vessel through rings along the bottom of the net and then back to the vessel. The {{most important part of the}} fishing operation is searching for the fish shoals and assessing their size and direction of movement. Sophisticated electronics, such as echosounders, sonar, and track plotters, may be used are used to search for and track schools; assessing their size and movement and keeping in touch with the school while it is surrounded with the seine net. Crows nests may be built on the masts for further visual support. Large vessels can have observation towers and helicopter landing decks. Helicopters and spotter planes are used for detecting fish schools. The main types of purse <b>seiners</b> are the American <b>seiners,</b> the European <b>seiners</b> and the Drum <b>seiners.</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} find out the {{magnitude}} of resistance and effective power on the three casco models of purse <b>seiner</b> i. e. round bottom, round flat-bottom and U-V bottom. In the present study, we employed a numerical simulation using Holtrop and Mennenn method. To get the values of motion resistance and effective power on various purse <b>seiner,</b> it was used the purse <b>seiner</b> speed of 0 - 12 knot. We developed the simulation using 12 purse <b>seiner</b> sampling data which were operating in Makassar Strait. Simulation results indicated that the increasing main dimension of purse <b>seiner</b> was proportional to the increasing the magnitude of resistance and effective power. This study suggested that the round flat of casco model has greater resistance compared with the othercasco model for purse <b>seiner</b> operating in Makassar Strait...|$|R
25|$|European <b>seiners</b> {{have their}} bridge and {{accommodation}} located {{more to the}} after part of the vessel with the working deck amidships. European <b>seiners</b> are most common in waters fished by European nations. The net is stowed in a net bin at the stern, and is set over the stern from this position. The pursing winch is normally positioned at the forward part of the working deck.|$|E
25|$|Tuna purse <b>seiners</b> {{are large}} purse <b>seiners,</b> {{normally}} over 45 metres, {{equipped to handle}} large and heavy purse seines for tuna. They have the same general arrangement as the American seiner, with the bridge and accommodation placed forward. A crows nest or tuna tower is positioned {{at the top of}} the mast, outfitted with the control and manoeuvre devices. A very heavy boom which carries the power block is fitted at the mast. They often carry a helicopter to search for tuna schools. On the deck are three drum purse seine winches and a power block, with other specific winches to handle the heavy boom and net. They are usually equipped with a skiff.|$|E

25|$|Asian <b>seiners</b> – In Asia, {{the seine}} netter usually has the {{wheelhouse}} forward {{and the working}} deck aft, {{in the manner of}} a stern trawler. However, in regions where the fishing effort is a labour-intensive, low-technology approach, they are often undecked and may be powered by outboards motors, or even by sail.|$|E
25|$|Trawler/purse <b>seiners</b> are {{designed}} so the deck equipment, including an appropriate combination winch, can be rearranged {{and used for}} both methods. Blocks, purse davits, trawl gallows and rollers need to be arranged so they control the pursing lines and warp leads and {{in such a way}} as to reduce the time required to convert from one arrangement to the other. These vessels are usually classified as trawlers, since the power requirement for trawling is higher.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, the U.S. fishing fleet used sailing vessels. By the early 20th century, fishing vessels were built as steam boats with steam engines, or as schooners with {{auxiliary}} gasoline engines. By the 1930s the fleet was almost completely converted to diesel vessels. Fishing gear became more technical: Alaska purse <b>seiners</b> were in use by 1870, longliners {{were introduced in}} 1885; otter trawls were operating in the groundfish and shrimp fisheries by the early 20th century. In the late 1960s, factory ships from other countries started fishing haddock, herring, salmon and halibut on traditional U.S. fishing grounds.|$|E
2500|$|American <b>seiners</b> {{have their}} bridge and {{accommodation}} placed {{forward with the}} working deck aft. American <b>seiners</b> are most common on both coasts of North America and {{in other areas of}} Oceania. The net is stowed at the stern and is set over the stern. The power block is usually attached to a boom from a mast located behind the superstructure. American <b>seiners</b> use Triplerollers. [...] A purse line winch is located amidships near the hauling station, near the side where the rings are taken on board.|$|E

2500|$|Cornwall has {{a strong}} culinary heritage. Surrounded on three sides by the sea amid fertile fishing grounds, Cornwall {{naturally}} has fresh seafood readily available; Newlyn is the largest fishing port in the UK by value of fish landed, and {{is known for its}} wide range of restaurants. Television chef Rick Stein has long operated a fish restaurant in Padstow for this reason, and Jamie Oliver chose to open his second restaurant, Fifteen, in Watergate Bay near Newquay. MasterChef host and founder of Smiths of Smithfield, John Torode, in 2007 purchased <b>Seiners</b> in Perranporth. One famous local fish dish is Stargazy pie, a fish-based pie in which the heads of the fish stick through the piecrust, as though [...] "star-gazing". The pie is cooked as part of traditional celebrations for Tom Bawcock's Eve, but is not generally eaten at any other time.|$|E
2500|$|The Tuvaluan economy {{therefore}} {{relies heavily}} on its fishing income, with 42% of the Tuvaluan population involved in fishing activity at various levels. UN Data calculated a gross value of fisheries at US$43,773,582 (2007 est), which accounted for the output of coastal commercial fishing, coastal subsistence fishing, locally based offshore fishing, foreign-based offshore fishing, freshwater fishing and aquaculture. In recent years [...] all of the income has been generated through the listed activities in Tuvalu waters, rather than through exports direct from Tuvalu. The activities of international fishing vessels, which in 2008 comprised 42 longline fishing vessels, 3 pole/line vessels and 126 purse <b>seiners,</b> far outweigh domestic activity, with a production volume of 35,541 tonnes worth US$40,924,370 (2009 est) or 93.5% of gross value, although Tuvalu retains a sizeable share in income via licensing. The fishing in the 900,000km2 of water area mainly consists of Skipjack Tuna, Yellowfin Tuna and Bigeye Tuna.|$|E
60|$|Since noon {{cautious}} coasters of {{all sorts}} had been dropping in with a casual air; the coal schooners and barges had rocked and nodded knowingly to one another, with their taper and truncated masts, on the breast of the invisible swell; and the flock of little yachts and pleasure-boats which always fleck the bay huddled together in the safe waters. The craft that came scurrying in just before nightfall were mackerel <b>seiners</b> from Gloucester. They were all of one graceful shape and one size; they came with all sail set, taking the waning light like sunshine on their flying-jibs, and trailing each two dories behind them, with their seines piled in black heaps between the thwarts. As soon as they came inside their jibs weakened and fell, and the anchor-chains rattled from their bows. Before the dark hid them we could have counted sixty or seventy ships in the harbor, and as the night fell they improvised a little Venice under the hill with their lights, which twinkled rhythmically, like the lamps in the basin of St. Mark, between the Maine and New Hampshire coasts.|$|E
