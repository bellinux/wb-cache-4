50|$|In 1995, Jerry Harvey was Van Halen's touring monitor engineer, mixing their stage sound through stage wedges—powerful {{loudspeakers}} {{aiming at}} each of the musicians. Drummer Alex Van Halen had great difficulty hearing the other band members over all the noise of the stage; louder monitors did not help. Harvey created a custom molded earpiece for the drummer to block some of the <b>stage</b> <b>noise</b> and focus on the desired sound: a prototype earpiece that contained two tiny speaker drivers, one for low frequencies and one for high frequencies, the frequencies split by a passive audio crossover. The high frequency driver was a stock Japanese component but a suitable low frequency driver was difficult to find. The only driver which survived strong kick drum signals was a Knowles-made pacemaker part, a balanced armature transducer intended to warn the pacemaker wearer of internal problems. Other Van Halen band members became interested and Harvey crafted further sets. The musicians touring with Van Halen—Skid Row—wanted some in-ear monitors and Harvey sold them six pairs for $3,000. Pop singer Engelbert Humperdinck wanted a set and at that point Harvey determined to start a company to supply the demand.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWallpaper fabric, {{a part of}} {{patterned}} fabric, is a new decorative material {{covered with}} fabric or other natural fibre materials. Wallpaper fabrics are different from other indoor decorative materials and are designed for daily use with easy maintenance instructions. Because of their high demand, quality assurance or fault detection and recognition, in wallpaper fabrics is important. One step that is important during fault detection is the removal of noise. A common type of noise that affects patterned fabric images is the impulse noise. In this paper, a method that modifies a switching median filter is proposed. The algorithm contains two <b>stages,</b> namely, <b>noise</b> detection <b>stage</b> and <b>noise</b> filtering <b>stage.</b> During <b>noise</b> detection a modified adaptive switching median filter with three new thresholds are used to remove the impulse <b>noise.</b> During filtering <b>stage,</b> an adaptive switching median filter is {{used to determine the}} size of the sliding window. To detect noisy pixels which are close to its neighbours that are normally missed with the traditional threshold of switching median filter, a modified threshold that considers the ranking order of the pixels in the sliding window is used. Both the enhanced <b>stages</b> improve the <b>noise</b> removal process while maintaining image details. The proposed denoising model was evaluated using three performance metrics, namely, PSNR, FoM and execution time.

Speech reconstruction at the back end is achieved by sinusoidal speech representation. Finally, the performance of the system is measured by the segmental signal-noise ratio, MOS tests, and the recognition accuracy of an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in comparison to other noise reduction methods...|$|E

30|$|From these results, it is {{convenient}} {{that the total}} output noise of the implemented amplifying and filtering chain is mostly defined by the induction coil thermal noise and less by the preamplifier noise. In particular, experimental measurements on several outdoor environments indicate that voltage gain amplifier stage should have a passband gain of 4 for better performance on Schumann measuring and recording resonances. In that case, the equivalent rms input noise of the last amplifying and filtering chain stage approximates to 5135.3  nV. Besides, each system stage has its own impact on the total output noise. That impact is determined by each <b>stage</b> <b>noise</b> value and its sequential arrangement at our amplifying and filtering chain system. The last consideration {{is based on the}} fact that the stage voltage noise experiences lower gain and thus exhibits less effect on the total system noise as it arranges closer to the output of our chain.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a novel spatial domain 2 -D sigma-delta {{modulation}} using two-layered discrete-time cellular {{neural networks}} (DT-CNNs) with multi-stage noise shaping (MASH) property is proposed. Although the sigma-delta modulation {{is widely used}} for realizing of {{analog to digital converter}} (ADC), sigma-delta concepts are only for 1 -D signals. Signal processing in the digital domain is extremely useful in 2 -D signals such as image processing, medical imaging, ultrasound imaging and so on. In the proposed architecture, the A-template is used for a digital to analog converter (DAC), the C-template works as an integrator, and the nonlinear output function is used for the bilevel output. Besides, due to the CNN characteristic, each pixel of an image corresponds to the cell of CNN, and each cell is connected spatially by the A-template. Also, the multi <b>stage</b> <b>noise</b> shaping (MUSH) property, which is one of a very effective framework for a high order sigma-delta modulation, is exploited for realizing a second order sigma-delta modulator by cascade connected first-order CNN sigma-delta modulators.
