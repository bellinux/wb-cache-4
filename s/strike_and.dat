5|$|Desert Strike was {{followed}} by four sequels Jungle Strike, Urban Strike, Soviet <b>Strike,</b> <b>and</b> Nuclear Strike that expanded on the basic gameplay it established. The design staff made efforts to retain game mechanics they felt embodied {{the core of the}} original. They believed removing those elements would result in a loss of focus of what attracted fans. As the series moved to more advanced consoles, Posehn became less involved in the programming side of development. Jungle <b>Strike</b> <b>and</b> Urban Strike, both released for the Genesis, featured additional vehicles and locations. Soviet Strike, released for the original PlayStation and the Sega Saturn in 1996, featured 3D graphics, as did Nuclear Strike, released on PC and PlayStation in 1997 and the Nintendo 64 in 1999. A fifth sequel provisionally titled Future Strike was planned, but the game was eventually released as , a mech-based shooter game.|$|E
25|$|The law limited wildcat <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> {{prohibited}} {{limitations on}} legitimate strikes. It also established the National Industrial Relations Court, which was empowered to grant injunctions {{as necessary to}} prevent injurious <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> settle a variety of labour disputes.|$|R
50|$|Redesigned {{striking}} game emphasizing jabs, quick <b>strikes,</b> <b>and</b> combinations. Elbow spamming {{has been}} fixed, with only certain fighters having elbows in clinch range. A fighter's reach {{is now a}} big part in <b>striking,</b> <b>and</b> new feint system and takedown-intercepting knees have been added.|$|R
5000|$|These unpopular {{measures}} led {{to increasing}} <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> protests in the country. At {{the beginning of}} May '69, a succession of <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> popular assemblies occurred in Córdoba, which were harshly repressed by the provincial and national militar authorities of the junta.|$|R
5|$|During the strike, despite {{considerable}} tensions, {{the city}} of Philadelphia remained mostly calm {{and there were no}} major outbreaks of violence. All of the city's newspapers editorialized against the <b>strike</b> <b>and</b> the public was, by and large, opposed to the strike as well. Several of the strike leaders, including James McMenamin and Frank Carney, were arrested for violating the anti-strike act. The NAACP played an active role both in pressuring the PTC and the federal government to institute fair hiring practices at the PTC for several years before the <b>strike,</b> <b>and</b> in maintaining the calm during the strike itself.|$|E
5|$|Romney took a {{leave of}} absence from Bain Capital from November 1993 to November 1994 to run for the U.S. Senate.

Against the advice of Bain Capital lawyers, Romney met the strikers, but told them he had no {{position}} of active authority in the matter.|$|E

5|$|A {{group of}} about 1,500 men began marching towards the {{electric}} distribution center used to power the entire streetcar system, several blocks away from the terminal building. The police had maintained a heavy guard around the building during the ongoing <b>strike</b> <b>and</b> Sheriff Porttens had given orders to use firearms to disperse any attempt by the strikers to take the building. As the crowd neared the building, the police opened fire. Several were injured and the crowd was driven away.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difficulty}} encountered {{during the}} aircraft's introduction was {{the occurrence of}} surging and stalling with the Avon engines. The F.2, which used the Armstrong-Siddeley Sapphire engine, did not suffer from this issue. Further problems occurred; ejected cannon ammunition links {{had a tendency to}} <b>strike</b> <b>and</b> damage the underside of the fuselage, and diverting the gas emitted by the cannon during firing was another necessary modification. The original split-flap airbrakes caused adverse changes in pitch trim and were quickly replaced by a single ventral airbrake. This meant, however, that the airbrake could not be used for landings.|$|E
5|$|During August, the Ju 87s {{also had}} some success. On 13 August {{the opening of the}} main German attacks on airfields took place; it was known to the Luftwaffe as Adlertag ("Eagle Day"). Messerschmitt Bf 109s of Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG 26) were sent out in advance of the main <b>strike</b> <b>and</b> {{successfully}} drew off RAF fighters, allowing 86 Ju 87s of StG 1 to attack RAF Detling in Kent unhindered. The attack killed the station commander, destroyed 20 RAF aircraft on the ground and a great many of the airfield's buildings. However, Detling was not an RAF Fighter Command station.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, UK and France were {{developing}} a new aircraft which could fill the RAF tactical <b>strike</b> <b>and</b> reconnaissance missions: the SEPECAT Jaguar was introduced into service in 1974, {{and led to a}} re-think of the Phantom's role as, at the same time, the limitations of the Lightning as an interceptor were becoming more apparent. The conversion of the RAF's FGR.2 squadrons to operate the Jaguar, combined with its use of the Blackburn Buccaneer, meant {{that it was possible to}} begin transferring Phantoms to operate purely as interceptors in the air defence role.|$|E

50|$|The {{government}} recorded 1,825 <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> lockouts in 1990. As a result, 24.1 million workdays were lost, 10.6 {{million to}} <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> 13.5 million to lockouts. More than 1.3 million workers {{were involved in}} these labour disputes. The number <b>and</b> seriousness of <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> lockouts have varied from year to year. However, the figures for 1990 and preliminary data from 1991 indicate declines from levels reached in the 1980s, when between 33 and 75 million workdays per year were lost because of labour disputes. In 1999, the government of India recorded about 927 <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> lockouts, or {{about half of those}} for 1990. The number of lost man-days were about the same for 1999 and 1991, even though Indian economic output and number of workers had grown significantly over the 1990s.|$|R

5|$|During the Pittston strike, the UMWA {{wanted to}} only use nonviolent means of {{protest against the}} company. Many union members practiced this method of civil disobedience and found {{creative}} ways for their message to be heard such as mass sit down <b>strike</b> <b>and</b> road blockades. However, many wildcat strikers ignored {{the request of the}} UMWA and used violence to express the anger that they felt toward the Pittston Coal Company. By the time the strike had ended, over 4,000people had been arrested for their actions.|$|E
5|$|Early Seventies Britain {{was a very}} {{depressing}} {{place with}} both the colour <b>strike</b> <b>and</b> the UK postal workers strike in full swing. It was completely run-down with trash on the streets, and total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if you came from {{the wrong side of}} the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then a whole bunch of copycat wankers after us.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, a huge {{general strike}} took place {{across the country}} at the {{instigation}} of the Belgian Workers' Party on the issue of voting rights. The system of plural voting, in force since 1893, was extremely unpopular because of its perceived unfairness, but also because the system tended to favor the Catholic Party. Although between 300,000 and 450,000 workers were involved, the strike was ultimately unsuccessful. The party voted in favor ending the <b>strike</b> <b>and</b> taking future action by parliamentary means, on 22 April 1913.|$|E
