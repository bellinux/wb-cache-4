5|$|Primitive {{fish have}} a four-chambered heart, but the {{chambers}} are arranged sequentially <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects deoxygenated blood, from the body, through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood {{flows into the}} atrium {{and then to the}} powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place. The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus which contains several valves and sends blood to the ventral aorta. The ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, into the rest of the body. (In tetrapods, the ventral aorta has divided in two; one half forms the ascending aorta, while the other forms the pulmonary artery).|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} type of {{single-mode}} fiber has a core diameter of 8–10 micrometers and is designed for use in the near infrared. The mode structure depends on the wavelength of the light used, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> fiber actually supports a small number of additional modes at visible wavelengths. Multi-mode fiber, by comparison, is manufactured with core diameters as small as 50 micrometers and as large as hundreds of micrometers. The normalized frequency V for this fiber should be less than the first zero of the Bessel function J0 (approximately 2.405).|$|E
25|$|An {{improved}} junction {{replaces the}} diamond with turnouts, {{which can be}} of as fine an angle as possible, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> junction can carry branch traffic at high speed. This configuration assumes power operation of the points, as high speed turnouts are generally not suitable for mechanical operation. The high speed turnouts may require more than one point machine each. The turnouts can have no superelevation while the curve in the branch can; therefore the radius in the turnouts must be greater than the radius of the curve in the branch.|$|E

25|$|These FM {{systems are}} unusual, {{in that they}} have a ratio of carrier to maximum {{modulation}} frequency of less than two; contrast this with FM audio broadcasting, where the ratio is around 10,000. Consider, for example, a 6-MHz carrier modulated at a 3.5-MHz rate; by Bessel analysis, the first sidebands are on 9.5 and 2.5MHz and the second sidebands are on 13MHz and −1MHz. The result is a reversed-phase sideband on +1MHz; on demodulation, this results in unwanted output at 6−1 = 5MHz. The system must be designed <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> unwanted output is reduced to an acceptable level.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide is also {{involved}} in the clearance of amyloid-β peptide. Amyloid-β peptides {{are one of the}} hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. When they are not degraded properly, these peptides accumulate and create plaques, which are clumps of amyloid-β peptide pieces, and they are highly associated with Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-β peptide clearance is important <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> accumulation does not occur. Sulfatide facilitates amyloid-β peptide removal through an endocytotic pathway, so when there are high levels of sulfatide, there are lower amounts of amyloid-β peptides. Since subjects with Alzheimer's disease have lower sulfatide levels, the clearance of amyloid-β peptides is lower, which allows the peptides to accumulate and create plaques in the brain.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of a plasma for polymerization depends {{on many of the}} following. An electron energy of 1–10 eV is required, with electron densities of 109 to 1012 per cubic centimeter, in order to form the desired plasma state. The {{formation of}} a low-temperature plasma is important; the electron temperatures are not equal to the gas temperatures and have a ratio of Te/Tg of 10 to 100, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> process can occur at near ambient temperatures, which is advantageous because polymers degrade at high temperatures, so if a high-temperature plasma was used the polymers would degrade after formation or would never be formed. This entails non-equilibrium plasmas, which means that charged monomer species have more kinetic energy than neutral monomer species, and cause the transfer of energy to a substrate instead of an uncharged monomer.|$|E

25|$|The massive {{amount of}} fruits and {{vegetables}} consumed daily by the zoo's animals are acquired free of charge through an agreement Shulov worked out with Israeli companies that tithe their produce in accordance with Jewish law. During the days of the Temple in Jerusalem, terumah, a tithe on agricultural produce, was designated for the kohanim (priests) and their animals. After the destruction of the Temple, the rabbis decreed that the tithed produce could not be used and had to be destroyed. The animals of the Biblical Zoo were symbolically sold to a Kohen <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> tithed produce could be given to them. The animals of the Biblical Zoo receive nearly a ton of the choicest fruits and vegetables every day through a distribution handled by the local religious council. Meat consumed by the carnivores is furnished by kosher butchers, veterinarians, and fishermen. Pruned branches from edible plants in the park, such as date palms, olive trees and carob trees, are also used for fodder.|$|E
25|$|The serious {{divisions}} between {{the western and}} eastern sections of Virginia had been simmering for decades, related to class and social differences. The western areas were growing and were based on subsistence farms by yeomen; its residents held few slaves. The planters of the eastern section were wealthy slaveholders who dominated state government. By December 1860 secession was being publicly debated throughout Virginia. Leading eastern spokesmen called for secession, while westerners warned {{they would not be}} legislated into treason. A statewide convention first met on February 13; after the attack on Fort Sumter and Lincoln's call to arms, it voted for secession on April 17, 1861. The decision was dependent on ratification by a statewide referendum. Western leaders held mass rallies and prepared to separate, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> area could remain in the Union. Unionists met at the Wheeling Convention with four hundred delegates from twenty-seven counties. The statewide vote in favor of secession was 132,201 to 37,451. An estimated vote on Virginia's ordinance of secession for the 50 counties that became West Virginia is 34,677 to 19,121 against secession, with 24 of the 50 counties favoring secession and 26 favoring the Union.|$|E
25|$|Now, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has {{invented the}} Esperanto language. It {{has all the}} {{potential}} qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice {{on the part of}} its devotees Esperanto will become universal. Therefore every one of us must study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of the world, and {{become a part of the}} curriculum in all the public schools. I hope that Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses, so that all people need acquire only two languages—one their own tongue and the other the international language. Then perfect union will be established between all the people of the world. Consider how difficult it is today to communicate with various nations. If one studies fifty languages one may yet travel through a country and not know the language. Therefore I hope that you will make the utmost effort, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> language of Esperanto may be widely spread.|$|E
