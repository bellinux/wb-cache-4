40|$|OBJECTIVE The {{period when}} <b>soccer</b> <b>players</b> detrarining {{at the end}} season is very {{important}} {{because it is not}} known how <b>soccer</b> <b>players</b> spend this period. The {{purpose of this study was}} to search opinions of <b>soccer</b> <b>players</b> about off sea-son in Turkish super league. METHODS 144 <b>soccer</b> <b>players</b> from Fenerbahce, Trabzonspor Denizlispor, Samsunspor, Genclerbirligi, Ankaragucu, Diyarbakırspor and Caykur Rizespor participated in this study. A questionnaire was developed, with 18 items. The reliability of quastionnaire was 0, 84. The following evalations were used in 5 point Likert Scale a) disagree totally, b) disagree, c) not sure, d) agree, e) agree totally RESULTS <b>Soccer</b> <b>players</b> had some physological and phycholigical loses in off season. They should rest actively and their taining should be descreased. It is necessary to give information to <b>soccer</b> <b>players</b> on how much strenght they lose during off season, and <b>soccer</b> <b>players</b> should spend off season accordingly. <b>Soccer</b> <b>players</b> want to rest and get healed from injuries during off season. At the same time they want to get psychological support. <b>Soccer</b> <b>players</b> don’t accept big losses in off season in off season while starting preparation period before season, and they think thet preparation period before season is a waste of time.

40|$|Body {{composition}} {{is a key}} consideration in the physical make-up of professional <b>soccer</b> <b>players.</b> The aims {{of the present study}} were to determine whether the body composition of professional <b>soccer</b> <b>players</b> varied according to playing position, international status or ethnicity, and to establish which variables best distinguished the <b>soccer</b> <b>players</b> from a reference group. Body composition was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 64 male professional <b>soccer</b> <b>players.</b> Measured variables included bone mineral density and the relative amounts of lean and fat mass. Data were analysed using analysis of variance and stepwise discriminant function. The <b>soccer</b> <b>players</b> recorded better values than a reference group (n = 24) for all body composition compartments. Percent lean mass and bone mineral density were the variables best able to identify the <b>soccer</b> <b>players</b> (95. 5 % correctly classified). Differences in body composition were evident between goalkeepers and outfield players, but not between outfield playing positions. No differences were found on the basis of international status.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} if an intensive pre- season training program modifies the inflammatory status in professional <b>soccer</b> <b>players</b> and if this inflammatory profile may be associated with the physical state.

No differences were found in cardiac high frequency, cardiac high frequency/low frequency ratio, tension index and oxygen volume consumption. Alpha- 1 -antitrypsin isotype- 3, fibrinogen-gamma isotypes- 1, 2 and 3 and vitamin-D-binding protein isotype- 1 were reduced in professionals players compared with those in recreational players. However, an increased content of alpha- 1 -antitrypsin isotype- 6 and alpha- 1 -antichymotrypsin 1 and 4 were found in professional <b>soccer</b> <b>players.</b> Spearman´s analysis showed a positive correlation between LF and fibrinogen-gamma chain isotype 3; but LF was negatively correlated with alpha-antichymotrypsin isotype 4. Professional <b>soccer</b> <b>players</b> submitted to an intensive training showed differences in the content of plasma proteins associated with inflammatory/oxidative stress and thrombosis with respect to recreational <b>soccer</b> <b>players.</b> Proteomics analysis in combination with the analysis of cardiac function assessment may be useful to know more in depth molecular processes associated with sport and intensive exercise...|$|R

40|$|<b>Soccer</b> <b>players</b> are {{required}} to have well-developed physical, technical and cognitive abilities. The present systematic review, adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, {{examined the effects of}} cognitive training strategies on motor and positive psychological skills development in soccer performance and identified the potential moderators of the “cognitive training-soccer performance” relationship. Thirteen databases were systematically searched using keywords related to psychological or cognitive training in <b>soccer</b> <b>players.</b> The review is based on 18 studies, employing 584 <b>soccer</b> <b>players</b> aged 7 - 39 years. Cognitive strategies, particularly imagery, appear to improve sports performance in <b>soccer</b> <b>players.</b> Regarding imagery, the combination of two different types of cognitive imagery training (i. e., cognitive general and cognitive specific) have a positive influence on soccer performance during training, whereas motivational imagery (i. e., motivational general-arousal, motivational general-mastery, and motivational specific) enhance competition performance. Younger <b>soccer</b> <b>players</b> employ cognitive general and cognitive specific imagery techniques {{to a greater extent than}} older <b>soccer</b> <b>players.</b> Combined cognitive training strategies were more beneficial than a single cognitive strategy relative to motor skills enhancement in elite (particularly midfielders) and amateur (i. e., when practicing complex and specific soccer skills in precompetitive period) <b>soccer</b> <b>players.</b> In conclusion, it appears that there are differences in cognitive/psychological training interventions, and their efficacy, according to whether they are directed towards training or competition, and the age, standard and playing position of the players...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate cardiac structures and function in <b>soccer</b> <b>players,</b> cyclists and long-distance runners, and compare them with non-athlete controls. Material/Methods: Cardiac structural, systolic, and diastolic function parameters in 53 athletes and 36 non-athlete controls were evaluated by Doppler echocardiography. Results: Athletes presented higher left atrial volume, left ventricular (LV) thickness, and LV and right ventricular (RV) diastolic diameters (LVDD and RVDD, respectively) compared to non-athletes. Left atrium and LVDD were higher in cyclists than runners, and RVDD was higher in cyclists than <b>soccer</b> <b>players.</b> LV mass index was higher in athletes, and cyclists had higher values than runners and <b>soccer</b> <b>players.</b> LV systolic function did not differ significantly between groups. The only altered index of LV diastolic function was a higher E/A ratio in cyclists compared to controls. There was no difference in LV E/E' ratio. RV systolic function evaluated by tissue Doppler imaging was higher in cyclists and <b>soccer</b> <b>players</b> than runners. There were no conclusive differences in RV diastolic function.
