25|$|The American {{woodcock}} is {{the only}} species of woodcock inhabiting North America.

25|$|The {{white-rumped sandpiper}} {{is placed in}} class Aves, which is {{contains}} all birds.

25|$|The bill tip organ is {{a region}} found near {{the tip of}} the bill in several types of birds that forage {{particularly}} by probing. The region has a high density of nerve endings known as the corpuscles of Herbst. This consists of pits in the bill surface which in the living bird is occupied by cells that sense pressure changes. The assumption is that this allows the bird to perform 'remote touch', which means that it can detect movements of animals which the bird does not directly touch. Bird species known to have a 'bill-tip organ' includes members of ibisis, shorebirds of the family <b>Scolopacidae,</b> and kiwis.|$|E
