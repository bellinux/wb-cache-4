5000|$|Metropolitan Avenue was {{a station}} on the {{demolished}} section of the BMT Jamaica Line. It had two tracks and two side platforms, with space for a third track in the center. A short stretch of third track was added {{for use as a}} lay-up or storage track, along with a <b>scissor</b> <b>crossover</b> near the temporary Queens Boulevard terminal in 1976, in anticipation of the line being cut back from 168th Street. This station was built as part of the Dual Contracts. It opened on July 3, 1918 by the Brooklyn Union Elevated Railroad, an affiliate of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, after the removal of Atlantic Avenue Rapid Transit service from Dunton LIRR station, and closed on April 15, 1985, with the Q49 bus replacing it until December 11, 1988. [...] The Q49 bus was discontinued {{when the rest of the}} Jamaica Line was connected to the Archer Avenue Subway.|$|E

Trains from Waterford also reverse back from [...] "Keane's points", where the curve out from the station joins the line. The track layout here {{has been reduced to}} now only two platforms. The bay platform to the north is used for trains to Limerick and Waterford/Rosslare and the main line platform is used for Dublin to Cork trains. The Waterford bay, which was located {{at the south end of}} the station, is now lifted and the so has the line that ran behind the station. The <b>scissor</b> <b>crossover</b> which is located halfway down the mainline platform is due to be lifted and the south loop of the mainline has now been disconnected. The Cork half of the through platform has also been removed and the area used to extend the car park.|$|E
