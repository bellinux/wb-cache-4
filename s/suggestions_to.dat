5|$|Historically Leigh {{was well}} {{connected}} to the local transport infrastructure, but with {{the closure of the}} railway in 1969 this is no longer the case. Public transport is co-ordinated by the Transport for Greater Manchester. There are bus services operated by First Greater Manchester, Jim Stones, Maytree Travel, Diamond Bus North West, Stagecoach Manchester and Network Warrington from Leigh bus station to many local destinations including Wigan, Bolton, Warrington, Manchester and St Helens. There had been <b>suggestions</b> <b>to</b> reopen the railway via Tyldesley to Manchester, but a guided busway scheme was chosen for the route; this decision was not universally popular.|$|E

The genesis of the blue men may alternatively lie with the North African slaves the Vikings took with them to Scotland, where they spent the winter months close to the Shiant Isles in the Minch.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the investigation, {{according}} to Thompson, Admiral Leon A. Edney, the Navy's Vice Chief of Naval Operations, {{interfered with the}} investigation by sending <b>suggestions</b> <b>to</b> Milligan on avenues of inquiry and pushing for a finding that Hartwig or Truitt was responsible. Edney interfered with the investigation {{in order to prevent}} any findings that the Navy had knowingly operated an unsafe ship in an unsafe manner. Also, Edney feared that if the Iowa class battleships were found to be unsafe, the battleships would be decommissioned and the Navy would lose the associated admiral billets plus the other warships and support ships assigned to the battleship groups.|$|E

5|$|Amazing {{raised its}} price from 75 cents to $1.00 with the November 1975 issue. The {{schedule}} switched to quarterly {{beginning with the}} March 1976 issue; as a result, the 50th anniversary issue had a cover date of June 1976. In 1977, Cohen announced that Amazing and Fantastic had lost $15,000, though Amazings circulation (at nearly 26,000) {{was as good as}} it had been for several years. Cohen looked for a new publisher to buy the magazines, but in September of the following year sold his half-share in the company to his partner, Arthur Bernhard. White had occasionally suggested to Cohen that Amazing would benefit from a redesign and investment; he made the same <b>suggestions</b> <b>to</b> Bernhard in early October. According to White, Bernhard not only said no, but told him he would not receive a salary until the next issue was turned in. In late 1978 White resigned, and returned all manuscripts in his possession to their authors, even if copy-edited and ready for publication. White claimed Bernhard had told him to do this, though Bernhard denied it.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{adjournment}} of the House in September 1789, they requested Hamilton to make {{a report}} on <b>suggestions</b> <b>to</b> improve the public credit by January 1790. Hamilton had written to Robert Morris as early as 1781 that fixing the public credit will win their objective of independence. The sources that Hamilton used ranged from Frenchmen such as Jacques Necker and Montesquieu to British writers such as Hume, Hobbes, and Malachy Postlethwayt. While writing the report he also sought out suggestions from contemporaries such as John Knox Witherspoon, and Madison. Although they agreed on additional taxes such as distilleries and duties on imported liquors and land taxes, Madison feared that the securities from the government debt would fall in foreign hands.|$|E
5|$|Berry was {{appointed}} Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget at the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, serving from 1997 to 2001. At the Interior Department, Berry improved credit union and continuing education options, oversaw {{the expansion of}} department programs to improve employees' work-life balance, and held town hall meetings with Interior employees and used their <b>suggestions</b> <b>to</b> upgrade a cafeteria and health center. These changes were partly funded through partnerships with federal employees, unions and other agencies to reduce costs for the department. Berry worked to create a complaint procedure for employees who experience discrimination because of their sexual orientation, to expand relocation benefits and counseling services to domestic partners of employees, to establish a liaison to gay and lesbian workers, and to eliminate discriminatory provisions of the National Park Service's law enforcement standards. He helped establish an office supply store for Interior employees, which he staffed with disabled workers. Berry oversaw {{one of the largest}} budgetary increases in the department's history.|$|E

American International Production's involvement with the film allowed Salvatore Billitteri of the Titra Sound Corporation to be on set to supervise the film for dubbing on its English-language release. As the film was going to be dubbed in different languages, actors could no longer phonetically pronounce their dialogue as {{it had to be done}} rhythmically to match various languages. Billitteri was also on set to give <b>suggestions</b> <b>to</b> Bava on how to make his film more appropriate for American audiences which led to decreasing the amount of violence in the film. The film was first conceived under the title The Fear.|$|E

The episodes were released in eight DVDs and a DVD box set on October 25, 2000 by Digital Site in Japan. The series was released in Northern America by Nozomi Entertainment in two parts; the first was released on March 4, 2014, and the second one is available since May 6, 2014.

5|$|None of the Commission's {{recommendations}} {{ever made}} it into law under the Rump Parliament, though the Commission did produce 16 bills. Several were read in the House of Commons, and the remainder given to the Parliamentary Law Committee in July 1652 following the Committee's dissolution on 23 July. The Rump Parliament's successor, the Barebone's Parliament, brought two of the Commission's <b>suggestions</b> (<b>to</b> abolish fines for original writs and to develop procedures for civil marriages) into force through statutes. Most of the Commission's suggestions were, at some point, followed. In 1837 {{the use of the}} death penalty was curtailed, and it was finally abolished in 1969. From 1702 onwards, witnesses were allowed for the defence, and the Prisoners' Counsel Act 1836 allowed legal representation for the defendants. The use of peine forte et dure was abolished in 1741, and the benefit of clergy in 1827. A permanent Law Commission was finally established with the Law Commissions Act 1965. County Courts were finally established in 1846, and a Court of Criminal Appeal in 1907.|$|E
5|$|One {{week later}} the FIA {{announced}} a review panel {{to investigate the}} cause of the accident, which was made up of former drivers and team principals, and published its findings four weeks later. The report found that there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident. Instead, the contributing factors were found to include track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the circuit. The report also made several <b>suggestions</b> <b>to</b> improve safety when recovering stricken vehicles — which were subsequently introduced for the 2015 season — before concluding that {{it would not have been}} possible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries through changes to the cockpit design. The report also revealed that the fail-safe for the car's brake-by-wire system had failed. Despite this, Marussia was not found to be responsible for the accident.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{originally}} planned to shoot scenes in Oakland, California before visiting the actual Philadelphia locations {{described in the}} novel.

Location manager Rory Enke and production designer Geoffrey Kirkland visited run-down areas of Philadelphia, and offered <b>suggestions</b> <b>to</b> Parker on his weekend visits from New York. Parker made an arrangement with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) that permitted the British crew members to work alongside members of both {{the east and west}} coast union locals.
