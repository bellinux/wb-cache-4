Thisstudy has the objective to evaluate the bondingperformance of furan based resin and its suitability forstructural purposes. There are some investigationsabout the possibility of incorporating the furan resin intowood adhesive formulations but their industrialexploitation is still modest.

40|$|Remodeling {{buildings}} often {{implies a}} modification of the mechanical behavior of the structural system, which may include the application of concentrated loads to beams that before have only been subjected to distributed loads. In the case of reinforced concrete beams, the new condition causes the beam to support a concentrated load in the cracked condition determined by the distributed loads that had been acting in the past. If the concentrated load is applied {{at or near the}} midspan of the beam, consequently, the shear demand reaches its maximum where the shear capacity is low. At and near the midspan, in fact, the cracks in the tension zone are vert ical, as the stirrups are. Therefore, the truss mechanism provides the shear capacity with a nil contribution, since both the struts and ties are vertical. Fiber-reinforced polymer composites allow these beams to increase their shear strength, up to guaranteeing adequate safety. This paper presents a method for analyzing the mechanical behavior of beams with vertical cracks, strengthened with FRP reinforcement, subjected to concentrated loads. The method def ines the direction of the fibers that the reinforcement has to be composed of and computes the <b>shearstrength</b> of the beam...|$|E
40|$|Natural fibers are {{considered}} to have potential use as reinforcing agents in polymer composite materials because of their principle benefits: moderate strength and stiffness, low cost, and be an environmental friendly, degradable, and renewablematerial. Due to their inherently hydrophilic nature, they are prone to absorb moisture, which can plasticise or weaken theadhesion of fibers to the surrounding matrix and by this affect the performance of composites used in atmospheric humidity,particularly at elevated temperatures. The surface treatments are often applied to the fiber to improve the bond strengthbetween the fibers and matrix. This work discussed the effect of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) treatment and epoxy resin as acompatibilizing agent on interface properties of pineapple leaf fiber (PALF) -epoxy composites. A single-fiber fragmentationtest coupled with data reduction technique was employed to assess interface quality in terms of apparent interfacial <b>shearstrength</b> (IFSS or a) of untreated, NaOH, and epoxy resin treated PALFs-epoxy composites. Tensile properties of untreatedand treated PALFs were also examined. It was found that both treatments substantially increase a, corresponding to animproved level of adhesion. The improvement {{in the level of}} adhesion for the alkali and epoxy treated fiber composites wasdue to an increase in the physical bonding between the alkali treated fibers and the matrix, and due to a promoted compatibilitybetween the epoxy treated fibers and matrix, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Concentrically braced steel frames (CBFs) can be {{optimised}} {{during the}} seismic design process by using lateral loading distributions {{derived from the}} concept of uniform damage distribution. However, {{it is not known}} how such structures are affected by uncertainties. This study aims to quantify and manage the effects of structural and ground-motion uncertainty on the seismic performance of optimum and conventionally designed CBFs. Extensive nonlinear dynamic analyses are performed on 5, 10 and 15 -storey frames to investigate the effects of storey <b>shearstrength</b> and damping ratio uncertainties by using the Monte Carlo simulation method. For typical uncertainties in conventional steel frames, optimum design frames always exhibit considerably less inter-storey drift and cumulative damage compared to frames designed based on IBC- 2012. However, it is noted that optimum structures are in general more sensitive to the random variation of storey shear-strength. It is shown that up to 50 % variation in damping ratio does not affect the seismic performance of the optimum design frames compared to their code-based counterparts. Finally, the results indicate that the ground-motion uncertainty can be efficiently managed by optimizing CBFs based on the average of a set of synthetic earthquakes representing a design spectrum. Compared to code-based design structures, CBFs designed with the proposed average patterns exhibit up to 54 % less maximum inter-storey drift and 73 % less cumulative damage under design earthquakes. It is concluded that the optimisation procedure presented is reliable and should improve the seismic performance of CBFs...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} programme {{is presented}} {{with the aim of}} characterising –from physical, microstructural and geotechnical perspectives– the main properties of compacted clay phyllites. These clay phyllites are widely used as waterproofing material for roofs in the Alpujarras (Andalusia, Spain), as sealing liners in irrigation ponds, and as core material of small earthen zoned dams. An exhaustive physical-characterisation programme on the powder fraction has been followed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), chemical analysis by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), thermal analysis, particle-size distribution analysis, consistency limits, and density of solid particles. From a microstructural standpoint, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) tests, as well as nitrogen-adsorption tests, were carried out to characterise the pore network and surface area of the material in both natural and compacted states. The geotechnical characterisation programme on the compacted material was focused on the water-permeability and water-retention properties, the volume change on soaking (swelling or collapse), the compressibility on loading, the <b>shearstrength</b> properties, and the mechanical-penetration properties. In this way, an important physical and hydro-mechanical data base is provided, which could help in evaluating the suitability for using this material {{in a wide range of}} earthen constructions (liners, road subgrades, embankments, core material in zoned dams). It has been found that the material contains illite, chlorite and quartz as the main components, and feldspar, iron oxide and interstratified illite–smectite as minor ones. Despite the presence of active clay minerals, the compacted material did not display an important swelling on soaking at low stresses, as a consequence of its low specific surface and low water-retention ability. The material exhibited good compaction properties and, consequently, low water permeability plus a stiff response on loading. Nevertheless, despite the low porosity attained on the dry-side compaction, the material underwent some collapse on soaking at stresses greater than 100 kPa.

40|$|KBS- 3 {{and very}} deep {{borehole}} (VDH) concepts {{are two major}} types of long-term geologicaldisposal methods for high-level radioactive waste (HLW) isolating from the biosphere. TheKBS- 3 V concept for isolating the HLW at the depth of 400 - 500 m, is the officially proposedoption in Sweden and {{has been the subject}} of considerable research in the past few decades,while the VDH concept was considered as an option in the 1950 s but later became discouragedbecause of insufficient experience in drilling technology. The greatest merit of the VDHconcept is that the almost stagnant groundwater in the deep boreholes prevents the transport ofthe possible release of radionuclides into the rock or up to the ground level. Since variousdisadvantages of the KBS- 3 V concept were found in previous research, the superiority of VDHconcept attracted the researchers to continue studying it into the late 1980 s. The geological repositories of both of KBS- 3 V and VDH types primarily consist of a naturalbarrier (host rock) and of an engineering barrier (also known as a buffer/backfill barrier). According to the principle of IAEA and national relative research organizations, thebuffer/backfill material should have low permeability and good expandability, as well assuitable physical and sealing properties. The thesis concerns the VDH concept and is focused on the construction and performance ofthose parts of the sealed repository that are not affected by high temperature or gamma radiation. In the lower part of a VDH repository, the clay packages containing HLW will be exposed tohigh temperature (100 - 150) in the borehole and to highly saline groundwater. In theinstallation phase of HLW, the groundwater will be pumped out and replaced by medium-softsmectite clay mud in which the HLW packages are installed vertically. During the hydrationand maturation of the clay components, the microstructural reorganization, water transport,migration of clay particles and redistribution of the density of the components take place. Thematuration determines the transient evolution of the clay seals and influences the rheologicaland soil mechanical behavior in the installation phase. The maturation of clay system alsodetermines their ultimate sealing potential of VDH repositories. This study presents the work carried out for investigating the maturation of the buffer-backfillclay in the HLW deep borehole. Initially in the study three types of clays, the Namontmorillonite,magnesium-rich and illite-smectite mixed layer clays, were examined for estimating their performance as the barrier candidate material. This is mainly presented in theliterature review. The experimental study was conducted on montmorillonite GMZ clays andI/S mixed-layer Holmehus clay. The expandability and permeability tests were carried out forinterpretation of the recorded swelling development and assessment of the effect of the salineconditions, with the goal of deriving a relationship between swelling pressure and hydraulicconductivity for different dry densities. The maturation tests of initially fully-saturatedHolmehus clay and partly saturated GMZ clay were performed. During the tests, the <b>shearstrength</b> mobilised by the relative movement of densified mud and migrated dense clay -contained in a perforated central tube - were determined. According to the results of <b>shearstrength</b> tests, the maximum operation time or the number of clay packages to be placed in asingle operation was evaluated, whilst the suitable saturation degree of the dense clay wasdiscussed as well. A model of the maturation of initially water-saturated clay seals based on Darcy’s law wasworked out and the evolution of the clay components in a lab-scale borehole using Holmehusclay were performed and compared with the experimental recordings. Good agreementsbetween the physical behaviors of the theoretical simulations and the measurements wasachieved by which the validity of the model was verified. Using the results, the hydration andsoil migration in the entire maturation process were presented in diagram. The model was alsoused for preliminary evaluation of the maturation products in real boreholes by assuming thesame Holmehus clay as used in the tests. Two constellation of borehole and dense clay withdifferent diameters, 80 cm borehole / 60 cm clay and 80 cm/ 50 cm, were assumed. The resultsrespecting dry density and hydraulic conductivity of the ultimate maturation products, and thedegree of homogeneous of the buffer and backfill clay system in the assumed boreholes, arepresented and discussed.

40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis {{is to apply}} {{scanning}} probemicroscopy (SPM) {{to the field of}} advanced powder processing. Measurement of interparticle surface forces at conditionsrelevant to ceramic processing has been performed together withthorough studies of powder friction. Surface force measurements between silicon nitride andsilica surfaces in 1 -bromonaphtalene and diiodomethane resultedin an attractive van der Waals force in both media for thesymmetric systems and a repulsive van der Waals force for theasymmetric systems. This agreed well with theoreticalpredictions from Lifshitz theory. Measurements in electrolytesolutions between silicon nitride surfaces with a varyingdegree of oxidation showed that silanol groups dominated theinteractions at a high degree of oxidation, whereas theinfluence of amine species became stronger after surfaceetching. Surface charge, surface potential and density ofsurface groups have been extracted from DLVO computer modellingof the experimental force curves. Surface force measurementshave been carried out using a nitrided silica sphere as acolloidal probe, representative for commercial silicon nitridepowders. Adsorption of poly(acrylic acid) above the isoelectricpoint generated a thin polymer layer of an essentially flatconformation. Friction force measurements were attainable via novelcalibration procedures of both the lateral photodetectorresponse and the cantilever torsional spring constant. Combining the method for detector calibration with evaluationof static friction slopes simplified the choice of appropriatecontact mechanics theory to evaluate the friction measurements. Applying the method on friction measurements between ironsurfaces coated with commercial lubricants showed a substantialsurface deformation not seen from the friction force alone. Thenanorheological properties of silica surfaces coated with twodifferent stearic acids have been evaluated from friction forcemeasurements. Steady sliding motion was replaced by highlyregular stick-slip motion at a critical load and velocity. Thestick-slip motion was successfully described and fitted to aphenomenological model. The contact area evaluated fromMaugis-Dugdale theory revealed the contact diameter to be veryclose to the stick-slip periodicity. Friction measurements were carried out between individualspray-dried ceramic granules as a function of binderconcentration and relative humidity. The hygroscopic nature ofthe binder resulted in a higher adhesion force but lowerfriction coefficient with increasing humidity. This effect wasascribed to softening of the binder and a lowering of the <b>shearstrength</b> of the binder rich surface layer on the granules. Comparison of the friction force between two granules and agranule and a hard metal surface confirmed that resistance toflow during the initial stages of powder pressing is dominatedby granule-wall friction and adhesion.

40|$|A common {{issue in}} {{stability}} analyses preformed in connection to Göta River and otherwatercourses {{is how the}} undrained shear strength of the clay should be modeled in transitionbetween land and river. This issue is in Sweden relatively unexplored and only a fewguidelines and publications are available regarding the subject. Furthermore, geotechnicalfield investigations are relatively expensive when preformed in the water areas which resultsin a limited surveyed data. The consequence of these aforementioned factors frequentlycreates underestimated, undrained shear strength. This will eventually result in a misleadingoverall safety factor in the analysis. The aim of the thesis has been to suggest a model of how the undrained shear strength shouldbe modeled in the labeled transition zone, based on {{a large amount of}} geotechnical surveysand the geological history. Geotechnical investigations have been studied in five sections inthe southern region of the Göta River. These studies include measured; undrained <b>shearstrength,</b> consolidation conditions and basic material properties of the clay. The results ofthese studies show that the shallow sediments in the river bed, has significantly lowerundrained shear strength than the corresponding level at the shore. The clay layer which hasthis lower shear strength corresponds to the actual water depth. In deeper areas of the riverbed the shear strength is similar from land to the river area. The undrained shear strengthseems to have a parable increment in this clay layer with lower shear strength. Several empirical calculations have been performed and compared to the geotechnical surveysto examine how well the undrained shear strength can be estimated, primarily the area of theriver bed with lower strength. It has been shown that the empirical estimation requires a lot ofknowledge, in particular consolidation conditions and stress distribution as a result of loadingand unloading. Furthermore, a simple stress analysis has been performed in Plaxis to illustrate the effectivestress distribution as well as the stress dispersion as a result of loading and unloading in anhomogeneous clay. The result shows in particular that the stress dispersion effects arisingcollaterally at both loading and unloading. A generalized stability analysis was executed to reveal how the different ways to model theundrained shear strength affects overall safety factor. This analysis resulted in a significantlyhigher overall safety factor, when the undrained shear strength was modeled according to themeasured results than how it has been modeled in many previously investigations. It may finally be noted that the uncertainties regarding how the undrained shear strengthshould be modeled in many cases has resulted in a conservative way to model the undrainedshear strength. in which the consequence has been an underestimated overall safety factor.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{various aspects}} of the durability offibre optic sensors embedded in composite. Since repair orreplacement of embedded sensors is not generally possible, thefunctional reliability of embedded sensors is one of the mostimportant prerequisites for successful use. The main researchobjective was to investigate the interaction between the sensorand the composite, and how this is affecting the mechanical andoptical sensor response. Fibre optic sensors embedded incomposite structures induce local stress concentrations whenthe composite is subjected to mechanical loads andenvironmental changes such as temperature and moisture. Acomplex transfer of stresses through the interfaces between theembedded sensor and the composite occurs and can result inlarge local stresses in the composite and a significant changein the response of the embedded sensor. These stressconcentrations make the interfaces susceptible todebonding. The sensor performance was studied experimentally andnumerically. Some basic results were generated for the EFPI andBragg grating sensors. The phase-strain response was determinedduring static and fatigue loading. The results showed that thesensors were more reliable in compression than in tensilestatic and fatigue loading. Generally, the sensor reliabilityduring loading was significantly improved for the Bragg gratingsensors over that of the EFPI sensor, as an effect of thesensor geometry. This was also demonstrated in theinvestigations on impacts. Impacts do not necessarily result indamage in the composite, but might cause debonding or otherfailure modes in the sensor area. Large, local stressconcentrations occur at several positions in the EFPI sensor,which pointed out that this sensor type was not suitable forembedded applications. The shift in focus from the sensor concept based on the EFPIsensor to that based on the Bragg grating sensor manifesteditself in several studies. The calculated deformation fieldaround an embedded optical fibre was verified in experimentsusing a high-resolution moiré interferometric technique. Furthermore, the improvement in the coating technology wasverified. A significant higher interfacial strength wasobtained with the silane-treated glass surface. The resultsindicated that at least a twofold improvement of the <b>shearstrength</b> was obtained. To simultaneously measure the in-plane strain components andthe temperature change, embedded Bragg grating sensors werearranged in a rosette configuration. The relationship betweenthe optical response from each sensor and the strains in thelaminate was numerically and analytically established. Damage lead to stress redistribution in the sensor region,which may influence the output from the embedded Bragg gratingsensor. The effect was numerically evaluated for interfacialdamage, and was compared to that of a sensor with undamagedinterface. The results showed that debonding might have asignificant influence, in particular for combined thermal andmechanical loading.
