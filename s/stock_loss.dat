40|$|Retention of well-fixed {{bone cement}} {{at the time}} of {{revision}} THA is appealing, as its removal can be difficult and risks bone <b>stock</b> <b>loss</b> or fracture. The technique of cement in cement revision however is not in widespread use. Femoral cement in cement revisions has been performed at our institution since 1989. Existing stems were removed to aid exposure for acetabular revision, alter version or leg length, or for component incompatibility. Minimum follow up of 5 years was available for 136 cases (in 134 patients) with a mean of 8 years (maximum 15). 35 cases underwent further revision surgery (26 acetabular loosening, 4 sepsis, 3 instability, 1 femoral fracture and 1 stem fracture). No femoral stem has been re-revised for aseptic loosening. These results support the technique of femoral cement in cement revision. Advantages include speed, less blood or bone <b>stock</b> <b>loss</b> and less risk of femoral perforation or fracture. ...|$|E

40|$|According {{to recent}} research, shrinkage, {{including}} theft, <b>stock</b> <b>loss</b> and damage, amounts to E 18 billion across Europe [...] roughly {{the equivalent of}} the Slovakian economy.

Some stock losses are the result of process failures where goods are lost through mis-picks, mis-deliveries, mis-counts or simple mis-scanning at the checkout.

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{consistent}} definition of natural disaster damage costs, i. e., equivalently, of natural disaster prevention benefits {{in accordance with}} general definition of benefits, Willingness to Pay, more concretely, Equivalent Variation, of any policy such as tax reforms, transportations, environments, infrastructures, etc. In order to formulate the damage cost it needs to model the economic behavior at and after the disaster periods given the disaster physical damages are measured by the equivalent labor loss and the equivalent capital <b>stock</b> <b>loss.</b> The model is composed of two stages. The first is the static general equilibrium given the labor loss and the equivalent capital <b>stock</b> <b>loss</b> measured above, for which this study will adopt the static computable general equilibrium (SCGE). The second is the dynamic macroeconomics which models the recovery process given the initial labor and capital stock for cases with and without disaster, for which this study will adopt the dynamic computable general equilibrium (DCGE). The damage cost or benefit of the disaster {{is defined as the}} present value of the time stream of Equivalent Valuation for the time stream of utility change due to the initial condition change. Then it will be shown that the conventional damage calculation by the reconstruction and/or replacement cost is assumes that the second stage immediately takes place at the disaster time, therefore, the first stage does not happens. Also sometimes the economic impacts on GDP of disaster capital <b>stock</b> <b>loss</b> are calculated but nothing is referred to the damage cost of disaster. This is because there is not yet clear definition of damage cost and lack of recognition of it is a work of only the first stage. Finally it will be discussed how to transform the disaster physical damages to the equivalent labor and capital <b>stock</b> <b>loss.</b> The physical damages are either private capital loss or labor loss or output loss or social overhead capital loss, each of which enters to CGE as private capital loss, labor force loss, efficiency parameter reduction due to both output loss and social overhead capital loss. Then assuming constant returns to scale the efficiency parameter change due to both output loss and social overhead capital loss can be transformed to the loss of labor and capital stock.

40|$|Acetabular bone <b>stock</b> <b>loss</b> compromises {{the outcome}} in primary and {{revision}} total hip arthroplasty. In 1979, a biologic method was introduced with tightly impacted cancellous allografts in combination with a cemented polyethylene cup for acetabular reconstruction. With this technique, {{it is possible to}} replace the loss of bone and to repair normal hip mechanics and hip function with a standard implant. Based on the authors' 20 years experience, a review of the long-term data is presented in primary total hip arthroplasty with preexisting acetabular bone <b>stock</b> <b>loss,</b> primary total hip arthroplasty in rheumatoid arthritis, patients who had bone impaction when younger than 50 years, and in acetabular revisions.

From biopsy specimens from humans and histologic data in animal experiments the incorporation of these impacted bone chips was proven.

40|$|To {{simulate}} femoral intramedullary bone <b>stock</b> <b>loss</b> in revision surgery {{of failed}} total hip arthroplasties, a method was developed using impacted trabecular bone grafts. In 14 goats a cemented {{total hip arthroplasty}} was performed, fixating the stem within a circumferential construction of bone allografts. After 6 or 12 weeks, 4 goats were used for mechanical tests and 3 for histology. The stability of the stems was determined in a loading experiment with roentgen-stereophotogrammetric analysis; loads of up to 1. 44 times body weight were used. One aseptic loosening was seen with gross movements. In the other cases the most important movements were axial rotations (max. 0. 24 degrees under 800 N) and axial translations (max. 0. 16 mm under 800 N). After unloading some elastic recovery occurred. There were no differences between the 6 and 12 -week groups. Histologically, revascularization and remodeling of the grafts were evident. Bone apposition and bone resorption of the grafts resulted {{in a mixture of}} graft and new bone. There was more new bone formation in the 12 -week group, but the process was not yet completed.
