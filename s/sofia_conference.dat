2500|$|The primary {{question}} {{regarding the}} timing of the uprising in Macedonia and Thrace implicated an apparent discordance not only among the SMAC and the SMARO, but also among the SMARO's leadership. At the Salonika Congress of January 1903, where Delchev did not participate, an early uprising was debated and it was decided to stage one in the Spring of 1903. This led to fiercing debates among the representatives at the <b>Sofia</b> SMARO's <b>Conference</b> in March 1903. By that time two strong tendecies had crystallized within the SMARO. The right-wing majority was convinced that if the Organization would unleash a general uprising, [...] Bulgaria would be provoced to declare war of the Ottomans and after the subsequent intervention of the Great Powers the Еmpire would collapse.|$|R

50|$|In this way, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Garvanov, the IMARO made a decision supporting a military revolt. As president of the Central Committee, he convened in January 1903 a congress in Thessaloniki, that resolved to launch an uprising against the Ottomans. The question regarding the timing of the uprising implicated an apparent discordance among the IMARO's leadership. This led to debates among the representatives at the <b>Sofia</b> IMARO's <b>Conference</b> in March 1903. The Centralists' majority was convinced that if the Organization would unleash an uprising, Bulgaria would declare war of the Ottomans and after the subsequent intervention of the Great Powers the Еmpire would collapse. The left-wing faction warned against the risks of such unrealistic plans, opposing the uprising as inappropriate as tactics and premature by time. In April Garvanov met with Dame Gruev and Gotse Delchev and they discussed the decision of starting the uprising. Garvanov, himself, did not participate in the Ilinden uprising, because of his arrest and exile in Rhodes after the Thessaloniki bombings of 1903.|$|R

March, 30 - 31, 2006, <b>Sofia,</b> Bulgaria: TENCompetence <b>Conference.</b> For {{almost three decades}} the concept of adaptation of computer education {{has been an important}} topic. Approaches to giving the student a central role in his/her own learning process have been described in literature from early Computer Based Training systems to more recent Adaptive Learning Hypermedia Systems. However, the approaches have tended to be highly specific in their implementation, hampering comparison and extension of results in the field. The IMS Learning Design specification (IMS LD) addresses many requirements for computer based adaptation and personalized eLearning. In this paper we give an overview of a number of approaches, definitions and features of adaptive learning; in the second section we identify how adaptive features and elements can be addressed by IMS LD, detailing a number of example Units of Learning which illustrate adaptation in different ways. In the final section we discuss issues in attaining the right balance between effort invested and results acquired while modelling IMS LD adaptive Units of Learning. Pro-Learn Projec...|$|R

It works through the formation of ad hoc, transient communities that exist for a limited period of time and stimulate learners to socially interact. The matchmaking system consists of a request module, a population module and a community module, all supported by a database that contains learning content, learner information and output of the system. The request module allows the learner to type in a request, the time span in which an answer should be provided and the content it is related to. The population module selects suitable learners to populate the community by determining their [1] content competency, [2] sharing competency, [3] eligibility and [4] availability. MOODLE is used to host the community. Experiments are planned to establish the feasibility of the overall design. This work has been sponsored by the EU project TENCompetenc...|$|R
