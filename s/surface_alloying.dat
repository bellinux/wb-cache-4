50|$|In this {{soldering}} process, heat {{is applied}} to the parts to be joined, causing the solder to melt and to bond to the workpieces in a <b>surface</b> <b>alloying</b> process called wetting. In stranded wire, the solder is drawn up into the wire between the strands by capillary action in a process called 'wicking'. Capillary action also takes place when the workpieces are very close together or touching. The joint's tensile strength is dependent on the filler metal used; in electrical soldering little tensile strength comes from the added solder which is why it is advised that wires be twisted or folded together before soldering to provide some mechanical strength for a joint. A good solder joint produces an electrically-conductive, water- and gas-tight join.|$|E
