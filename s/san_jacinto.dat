5|$|Thereafter, Independence was {{involved}} in two important diplomatic missions, first in May 1836 carrying <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> President David G. Burnet, with his cabinet, and Santa Anna to sign the Treaty of Velasco after the Battle of <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> and then, in June, setting sail for New Orleans with commissioners Peter William Grayson and James W. Collinsworth on board. These men continued their journey to Washington, D.C., where they negotiated with the United States for {{the recognition of the}} independence of Texas.|$|E
5|$|After the Texas {{victory at}} the Battle of <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> in April, 1836, Independence carried the Texas President and his captive, General Santa Anna, to Velasco, where the Treaty of Velasco was {{negotiated}} and signed.|$|E
5|$|Muster: Tradition on 21 April, <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> Day where Aggies {{from all}} over the world meet with each other and honor those Aggies who have died that year.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{other health}} care {{facilities}} exist {{in the region as}} well. Notable facilities outside the area covered by BAHHN include <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> Methodist Hospital (Baytown) and Mainland Medical Center (Texas City).|$|E
5|$|On 24 February 1990, tugboats moved Texas from {{dry dock}} to a repair {{facility}} on Green's Bayou for further repairs. It {{was here that}} the wood deck was installed and four of the ten mounts of quad 40mm guns were installed. On 26 July, the ship was returned to her berth at <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> where the final six mounts of 40mm guns were installed. Repairs complete, the ship officially reopened to the public on 8 September 1990. Since returning to her slip at <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto,</b> members of the ship's staff and volunteers have worked to restore the interior spaces.|$|E
5|$|The United States Postal Service {{operates}} the Amarillo Main Post Office. Other post {{offices in the}} city include Downtown Amarillo, Jordan, Lone Star, North Amarillo, and <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of {{evaluating}} {{a wide range of}} alternative plans to address the ship's problems (as well as other issues at <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto),</b> TPWD, working with many of the stakeholders at the <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> Battleground State Historic Site, adopted a Master Plan that called for placing Texas into a permanent dry berth. After the Master Plan was formally adopted by TPWD in 2004, the Texas Legislature was approached to secure appropriate funding. The Legislature allowed the voters of Texas to express their opinion and on 6 November 2007 Texas voters approved $25 million in funds to dry-berth the ship to prevent further deterioration from the corrosive waters of the ship channel.|$|E
5|$|Museums in {{the area}} include the <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> Museum of History, the Bay Area Museum (Seabrook), the Pasadena Historical Museum, the West Bay Common School Museum (League City), the Baytown Historical Museum, the Texas City Museum, the Buttler Longhorn Museum (League City) and the Dickinson Railroad Museum.|$|E
5|$|SR 243 {{begins at}} SR 74 in the <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> Wilderness near Mountain Center, Riverside County as Idyllwild Road. The highway {{traverses}} north along a winding road through {{the community of}} Idyllwild. SR 243 makes a left turn at the intersection with Circle Drive and continues through Pine Cove. The road continues through the forest past Mount <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> State Park through Twin Pines and the Morongo Indian Reservation before making a few switchbacks and descending {{en route to the}} city of Banning as the Banning Idyllwild Panoramic Highway. The highway continues as San Gorgonio Avenue into the city before making a left onto Lincoln Street and a right onto 8th Street and terminating at a diamond interchange with I-10.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{declaration}} of independence from Spain the new nation of Mexico moved to colonize its northern territory of Texas by offering land grants to settlers both from within Mexico and from the nearby United States. Small settlements such as Lynchburg and <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> were gradually established around the bay and in 1830 Mexican authorities created a customs and garrison post at Anahuac commanded by Juan Davis Bradburn.Henson (1982), p. 49.Henson (1982), p. 51.Galveston Bay Estuary Program (2002), p. 27–28. Conflicts between Bradburn and the settlers in the region led to the Anahuac Disturbances, a prelude to the larger Texas rebellion that was to come. Following a coup in the Mexican government many freedoms previously enjoyed by the Texans were revoked causing Texas to revolt and declare its independence in 1835. After a number of battles the Texas army, {{under the leadership of}} General Sam Houston, finally defeated the Mexican Army in the Battle of <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto,</b> near modern Pasadena.|$|E
5|$|Galveston Bay is an estuary {{along the}} Texas Gulf Coast. The bay {{as a whole}} is {{composed}} of four major sub-bays: Galveston Bay proper, Trinity Bay, East Bay, and West Bay. Other smaller bays and lakes connecting to this complex of waterways in the Bay Area include <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> Bay, Burnet Bay, Scott Bay, Crystal Bay, Goose Lake, Clear Lake, Dickinson Bay, and Moses Lake.|$|E
5|$|New Washington was looted {{and burned}} on April 20 by Mexican troops, {{and as many}} as 5,000 civilians fled, either by boat or across land. Those {{attempting}} to cross the <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> River were bottlenecked for three days, and the vicinity around the crossing transformed into a refugee camp. Burnet ordered government assistance all across Texas for fleeing families.|$|E

5|$|Texas Chiropractic College in Pasadena, one of {{only two}} schools of chiropractics in Texas and one of a handful in the nation, {{provides}} training for students from around the state. Several community colleges serve communities in the area as well, including <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> College, College of the Mainland, Lee College, and Houston Community College.|$|E
5|$|The present {{geography}} of the Gulf Coast was formed during an ice age approximately 30,000 years ago when dramatic lowering of the sea level occurred. As the ice later melted, it formed a flow through the Trinity and <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> rivers and carved wide valleys in the soft sediments, resulting {{in the creation of}} the modern system of bays and lakes approximately 4500 years ago.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Rubí's recommendations, Presidio de San Agustín de Ahumada was closed in 1771, leaving the Texas coast unoccupied except for La Bahía. In July 1772, however, the {{governor}} of Texas heard rumors that English traders were building a settlement {{in the area of}} the Texas coast that had been abandoned. The commander of La Bahía was sent to find the settlement, but saw no sign of other Europeans. His expedition did, however, discover that the <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> River emptied into Galveston Bay and not into the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Following a coup in the Mexican government, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna became {{president}} and revoked many freedoms previously {{enjoyed by the}} Texans further deteriorating the government's relations with the region's settlers. Texas declared its independence and revolted in 1835. Following a number of battles with the Mexican army, the Texas army, {{under the leadership of}} General Sam Houston, finally defeated Santa Anna in the Battle of <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto,</b> near modern Pasadena.|$|E
5|$|The San Andreas Fault has offset Indian stone rings, {{its path}} is buried by sediments from Lake Cahuilla. During the Pleistocene, this fault was {{relatively}} inactive {{compared to the}} Imperial Fault and the <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> Fault. Other faults that crossed the shores of Lake Cahuilla are the Extra fault zone, which divides a northern more stable basin from a southern basin that underwent tectonic extension and slightly slower sedimentation, the Coyote Creek Fault (whose movement rate has been estimated from displacement of Lake Cahuilla sediments and probably accelerated {{during the time of}} Cahuilla's highstand), the Superstition Mountain Fault which extends from the Coyote Creek fault, the <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> Fault which runs parallel to part of Cahuilla's western shore, was last active in 820-1280, 1280, 1440-1637 and 1440-1640 and whose fault trace could be buried beneath sediments from Lake Cahuilla, and the Elmore Ranch fault which displays evidence of after-lake activity in the Superstition Hills. Faults on the lake floor include the Brawley Seismic Zone, potentially the Cerro Prieto Fault, the Imperial Fault, and the Kane Springs Faults. The Imperial Fault may have ruptured together with a rupture of the San Andreas Fault during a highstand of Lake Cahuilla, and was last active during the 1940 Imperial Valley earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} {{around the}} bay features {{a mix of}} swamps, beaches, industrial facilities, tourist attractions, and historic sites. The area's developing population is ethnically diverse with a growing international community. The communities host cultural events ranging from ballet and musical theater to fairs and rodeos. The bay itself supports a commercial fishing industry and features {{one of the highest}} concentrations of marinas in the nation. On land the area holds numerous historic sites such as the <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> Monument, and many parks and nature preserves such as the Armand Bayou Nature Center.|$|E
5|$|The {{newly elected}} Texian {{delegates to the}} Convention of 1836 quickly signed a Declaration of Independence on March 2, forming the Republic of Texas. After electing interim officers, the Convention disbanded. The new {{government}} joined the other settlers in Texas in the Runaway Scrape, fleeing from the approaching Mexican army. After several weeks of retreat, the Texian Army commanded by Sam Houston attacked and defeated Santa Anna's forces at the Battle of <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto.</b> Santa Anna was captured and forced to sign the Treaties of Velasco, ending the war.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{recreational}} opportunities along the Santa Ana River. The Santa Ana River watershed includes {{parts of the}} Cleveland National Forest, San Bernardino National Forest, Angeles National Forest, Mount <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> State Wilderness Area, Chino Hills State Park, and Lake Perris State Recreation Area. Big Bear Lake, Lake Elsinore, and Lake Irvine are popular recreational lakes in the watershed. The river never actually flows through any of these lakes, but they each have drainage to the river via tributaries.|$|E
5|$|Three {{community}} college districts exist with campuses {{in and around}} Houston. The Houston Community College System serves most of Houston. The northwestern through northeastern {{parts of the city}} are served by various campuses of the Lone Star College System, while the southeastern portion of Houston is served by <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> College, and a northeastern portion is served by Lee College. The Houston Community College and Lone Star College systems are within the 10 largest institutions of higher learning in the UnitedStates.|$|E
5|$|UH's {{first session}} as a {{four-year}} institution began June 4, 1934, at <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> High School with an enrollment of 682. In 1934, the first {{campus of the}} University of Houston was established at the Second Baptist Church at Milam and McGowen. The next fall, the campus {{was moved to the}} South Main Baptist Church on Main Street—between Richmond Avenue and Eagle Street—where it stayed for the next five years. In May 1935, the institution as a university held its first commencement at Miller Outdoor Theatre.|$|E
5|$|With the <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> Fault Zone to the northwest, the Elsinore fault to the south-southwest, and the Imperial fault {{centered}} {{directly under}} the Imperial Valley, the area frequently encounters seismic activity, including moderate and damaging earthquakes. Other events in 1852, 1892, 1915, 1940, 1942, and 1987 have impacted the region. More small to moderate events of less than 6.0 (local magnitude) have occurred in this area than any other section of the San Andreas fault system.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all of the}} Texians {{were killed}} at the Battle of the Alamo when the Mexican army {{attacked}} on March 6; Travis was likely the first to die. Unaware that the Alamo had fallen, reinforcements continued to assemble; over 400Texians were waiting in Gonzales when news of the Texian defeat reached the town on March 11. Earlier that day, General Sam Houston, newly reappointed commander of the Texian Army, had arrived in Gonzales. On hearing of the Alamo's fall, Houston took command of the assembled volunteers. The following month, this hastily organized army defeated Santa Anna at the Battle of <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto,</b> ending the Texas Revolution.|$|E
5|$|As Secretary, Jewell {{approved}} {{the first phase}} of the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP). The DRECP focuses on renewable energy and land conservation in California's desert. At the signing ceremony, held September 16, 2016, at the Santa Rosa & <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> Mountains National Monument Visitor Center, Secretary Jewell stated phase one was intended to streamline approval for solar, wind, and geothermal projects. The DRECP also aimed to preserve 4.2million acres of land. Conservation groups viewed the initiative more favorably than did wind and solar developers, who criticized the DRECP for removing some public land designated for development.|$|E
5|$|Following Mexico's {{independence}} from Spain, {{the new nation}} established long-term settlements, including Anahuac and <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto,</b> around the bay. Early rebellions by the settlers against Mexican rule occurred {{in the region and}} it was later the site of the victory of the Texas army over the Mexican army during the Texas Revolution. Following Texas' {{independence from}} Mexico and its annexation by the United States, economic growth was centered initially on agriculture and cattle ranching. Commerce grew between Galveston, Harrisburg and Houston in the later 19th century, and created additional economic opportunities as railroads were built through the Bay Area to connect these and other commercial centers.|$|E
5|$|Following the battle, Santa Anna was {{alternately}} {{viewed as}} a national hero or a pariah. Mexican perceptions of the battle often mirrored the prevailing viewpoint. Santa Anna had been disgraced following his capture at the Battle of <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto,</b> and many Mexican accounts of the battle were written by men who had been, or had become, his outspoken critics. Petite and many other historians believe {{that some of the}} stories, such as the execution of Crockett, may have been invented to further discredit Santa Anna. In Mexican history, the Texas campaign, including the Battle of the Alamo, was soon overshadowed by the Mexican–American War of 1846–48.|$|E
5|$|Galveston Bay {{is mostly}} shallow {{with an average}} depth of 7–9feet. It is fed by the Trinity River and the <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> River, {{numerous}} local bayous and incoming tides from the Gulf of Mexico. This unique and complex mixing of waters from different sources supports many types of marine life including crabs, shrimp, oysters, and many varieties of fish thereby supporting a substantial fishing industry. Additionally the system of bayous, rivers, and marshes that ring the Bay support their own ecosystems allowing for diverse wildlife and enabling freshwater farming of crawfish. The areas near the bay shore in fact have a higher diversity of habitats than the nearby Gulf coast.|$|E
5|$|Originally HJC {{was located}} in <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> High School and offered only night courses. Its first session began March 7, 1927, with an {{enrollment}} of 232 students and 12 faculty. This session was primarily held to educate the future teachers of the junior college, freshmen were not permitted to enroll. A more accurate date for the official opening of HJC is September 19, 1927, when enrollment was opened to all persons having completed the necessary educational requirements. The first president of HJC was Edison Ellsworth Oberholtzer, who was the dominant force in establishing the junior college.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Alamo (February 23– March 6, 1836) was {{a pivotal}} {{event in the}} Texas Revolution. Following a 13-day siege, Mexican troops under President General Antonio López de Santa Anna {{launched}} {{an assault on the}} Alamo Mission near San Antonio de Béxar (modern-day San Antonio, Texas, United States), killing all of the Texian defenders. Santa Anna's cruelty during the battle inspired many Texians—both Texas settlers and adventurers from the United States—to join the Texian Army. Buoyed by a desire for revenge, the Texians defeated the Mexican Army at the Battle of <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto,</b> on April 21, 1836, ending the revolution.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 40, the city's major east–west {{thoroughfare}} {{was completed}} entirely through Amarillo in November 1968 across {{the center of}} the city. Previously, U.S. Highway 66 was the major east–west highway through the city, generally following Amarillo Blvd. {{to the north of the}} downtown area and then curving southwest to leave the city near the Veterans Hospital. A city route (which was an original alignment of US 66 through central and west Amarillo) followed Fillmore south into the downtown area and turned on West 6th through the <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> Heights district which is now home to many antique shops, restaurants and other businesses, passing the Amarillo Country Club and veering onto West 9th Street and Bushland Blvd. before tying into the through route at a traffic circle near the Veterans Hospital.|$|E
5|$|John Mannen (Jack) Lansdale {{was born}} in Oakland, California on 11 June 1912, the son of John Lansdale Sr. and his wife May Hamilton née Mannen. After his sister Sally Mannen Lansdale {{was born in}} 1921 he dropped his middle name and was {{henceforth}} known as John Lansdale Jr. He was educated at <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> High School, from which he graduated in 1929. He entered the Virginia Military Institute, graduating in 1933, and then Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in June 1936. He took {{a job with a}} law firm, Squire, Sanders and Dempsey (now Squire Patton Boggs), initially in Cleveland, Ohio and later in Washington, D.C. He married Metta Virginia Tomlinson in Trinity Episcopal Church in Houston, Texas on 17 June 1936. They had five daughters.|$|E
5|$|The Runaway Scrape events {{took place}} mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, {{and were the}} {{evacuations}} by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto.</b> The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas {{and much of the}} civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna.|$|E
5|$|The Santa Ana {{drainage}} basin has {{a diversity of}} terrain, ranging from high peaks of inland mountains {{in the north and}} east, to the hot, dry interior and semi-desert basins of the Inland Empire, to the flat coastal plain of Orange County. Although it includes areas of alpine and highland forest, the majority of the watershed consists of arid desert and chaparral environments. Due to low regional rainfall, the river carries only a small flow except during the brief winter season, when it is prone to massive flash floods. The <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto</b> River, which drains the southern half of the watershed, rarely reaches the Santa Ana except in extremely wet years. However, a wide variety of animal and plant communities depend on the riparian zones and remnant wetlands along the Santa Ana River.|$|E
5|$|The {{letter was}} {{initially}} entrusted to courier Albert Martin, who {{carried it to}} the town of Gonzales some seventy miles away. Martin added several postscripts to encourage men to reinforce the Alamo, and then handed the letter to Launcelot Smithers. Smithers added his own postscript and delivered the letter to its intended destination, San Felipe de Austin. Local publishers printed over 700copies of the letter. It also appeared in the two main Texas newspapers and was eventually printed throughout the United States and Europe. Partially in response to the letter, men from throughout Texas and the United States began to gather in Gonzales. Between 32 and 90 of them reached the Alamo before it fell; the remainder formed the nucleus of the army which eventually defeated Santa Anna at the Battle of <b>San</b> <b>Jacinto.</b>|$|E
