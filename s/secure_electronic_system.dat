This seminar hosted researchers in <b>secure</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>system</b> design, spanning all abstraction levels from cryptographic engineering over chip design to system integration. We recognize that scaling is a fundamental force present at every abstraction level in electronic system design. While scaling is generally thought of as beneficial to the resulting implementations, this does not hold for secure electronic design. Indeed, the relations between scaling and the resulting security are poorly understood. This seminar facilitated the discussion between security experts at different abstraction levels in order to uncover the links between scaling and the resulting security...|$|E

Healthcare organizations collect and produce large volumes of data on daily basis. Information technology allows automatization of processes for extraction of data that help to get interesting knowledge and regularities. In this paper we are using the Data mining techniques like K Means and Weighted Association rule for the elimination of manual tasks and easier extraction of data directly from electronic records, transferring onto <b>secure</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>system</b> of medical records which will save lives and decrease the cost of the healthcare services.

In this study we have proposed a best fit for data mining techniques in healthcare based on a case study. The proposed framework aims to provide self healthcare treatments where by several monitoring equipments using the cyberspace devices have been developed to help patients manage their medical conditions at home for example, diabetic patients can test their blood sugar level by using e-device, which, with the click of a computer mouse, downloads the results to a healthcare practitioner, minimizes time to wait for medical treatments, and minimizes the delay time in providing medical treatments.

Data mining can enable healthcare organizations to predict trends in the patient conditions and their behaviors, which is accomplished by data analysis from different perspectives and discovering connections and relations from seemingly unrelated information. Raw data from healthcare organizations are voluminous and heterogeneous. They need to be collected and stored in the organized forms, and their integration enables forming of hospital information system. Healthcare data mining provides countless possibilities for hidden pattern investigation from these data sets. These patterns can be used by physicians to determine diagnoses, prognoses and treatments for patients in healthcare organizations. </span...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Many <b>electronic</b> voting <b>systems,</b> {{classified}} {{mainly as}} homomorphic cryptography based, mix-net based and blind signature based, appear after the eighties when zero knowledge proofs were introduced. The common ground {{for all these}} three systems {{is that none of}} them works without real time cryptologic calculations that should be held on a server. As far as known, the agent-based approach has not been used in a <b>secure</b> <b>electronic</b> voting <b>system.</b> In this study, an agent-based electronic voting schema, which does not contain real time calculations on the server side, is proposed. Conventional cryptologic methods are used in the proposed schema and some of the requirements of an <b>electronic</b> voting <b>system</b> are constructed within the schema.

For the considerations of efficiency, a <b>secure</b> <b>electronic</b> payment <b>system</b> proposed in this paper is developed by using elliptic curve cryptosystems (ECC) instead of modular exponentiation schemes, because ECC possess fewer bits achieving the same security level as other public key cryptosystems.
