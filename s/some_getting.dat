About 10-12% of testers felt angry and alienated at the thought, and said they might stop drinking Coke altogether. Their presence in focus groups tended to negatively skew results as they exerted indirect peer pressure on other participants.|$|E

Bettenhausen called the controls [...] "a tad reckless at first – Sonic's momentum takes <b>some</b> <b>getting</b> used to, {{and trying to}} go in reverse is a pain – but become more natural and fluid as you get acclimated to the fast-paced, twitchy action." [...] Casamassina and Mueller offered similar opinions, while Shepperd criticized the game's low camera angle and arbitrary targeting system. Bettenhausen dismissed the game's multiplayer mode as a failed adaptation of the Mario Party series.

Casamassina compared the games to those in : [...] "only a handful of them really stand out and some are downright pointless, but overall gamers will probably be happy that they were included."

The original ending of Aqua's storyline showed her trapped {{in the realm of}} darkness, but that part was moved to the game's [...] "Last Episode" [...] playthrough {{in order to keep the}} game from being too negative in tone. In terms of gameplay, Aqua was designed to be a character gamers would take <b>some</b> <b>getting</b> used to, and recommended them use her as the last one in order to understand the game's story better, pointing out the intention that Aqua would be the last character to leave the Land of Departure in her scenario. The staff developed her movements to reflect her personality as a serious and dignified young woman. In the making of Kingdom Hearts 2.8, co-director Tai Yasue expressed the staff wanted to explore Aqua's torment in this title as she became trapped in the realm of darkness to the point they showed how the character wanted to escape from it as she became isolated.|$|E

500|$|The game's note {{tracks were}} {{particularly}} analyzed and {{compared with the}} songs' previous versions in the older games. While the note-tracking has generally been improved to avoid [...] "walls of notes"long sections of fast-moving notes requiring significant skill to surpassthese patterns are significantly different from their previous incarnation and may take <b>some</b> <b>getting</b> used to. Roper {{also noted that the}} new features of Guitar Hero World Tour, particularly the use of [...] "slider notes" [...] that use either the World Tour touchpad or simple tapping without strumming on any other guitar controller's frets, makes many of the more difficult parts of the songs easily passed, requiring less technical skill to complete; Roper cited his ability to easily pass the first solo in what is considered to be the series' most difficult song, [...] "Through the Fire and Flames" [...] in Smash Hits while he could not pass this section on Guitar Hero III. In contrast, Abbie Heppe of G4 TV found the recreation of the note tracking to have [...] "varying degrees of success", noting that while some of the guitar solos are more manageable, there were questionable sections in other songs arising from the nature of Star Power phrases when it was changed in Guitar Hero III. Gerstmann said that the difficulty of the non-lead guitar portions of the game was not as high as that of the lead guitar, primarily due to these songs' having been selected originally for being played by guitar controllers and not by a full band. Heppe suggests that some of these problems {{may be due to the}} farming out of the series to a different developer with no previous experience in the series. However, Bramwell was careful to note that Beenox Studios' effort on the game was strong, particularly with following the Guitar Hero: Metallica model, and their effort should not be dismissed due to how Activision chose to release the title.|$|E

Pitchfork were similarly impressed with the eclecticism of the album, stating that the group seemingly try every musical genre possible and succeed in their efforts.

Cokemachineglow also commented on the band's musical versatility, stating that, although the record features a mix of styles, it is a cohesive whole; a [...] "perfectly flowing album", that showcases some of the Super Furry Animals' best songs. AllMusic agreed calling Guerrilla arguably the band's [...] "most cohesive" [...] album and a [...] "pleasingly and consistently unpredictable" [...] record. Yahoo!
