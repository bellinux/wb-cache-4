This study examines the effectiveness of <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> <b>advertising</b> within a multimedia campaign, with explicit consideration of the interaction effects between <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> <b>advertising</b> and television and banner advertising. An advertising tracking study with about 300 respondents interviewed before and about 4, 700 respondents interviewed after the advertising campaign examines the effects on four consumer metrics: advertising awareness, brand awareness, brand image, and brand consumption. We estimate advertising effectiveness and control for correlations across the four ordinal response metrics using a multivariate ordered probit model. The results show that <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> <b>advertising</b> has significant effects on several consumer metrics, even among consumers who do not click on the sponsored advertisement. Television advertising also affects the consumer metrics. However, a negative interaction effect emerges between <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> <b>advertising</b> and television advertising. Banner advertising exerts a positive impact, but only in combination with television advertising. These substantial interaction effects indicate that firms must consider the investments in various media channels simultaneously when they design multimedia campaigns...|$|E

40|$|Each {{search term}} {{put into a}} search engine {{produces}} a separate set of results. Correspondingly, each of the sets of ads displayed alongside these results is priced using a separate auction. <b>Search</b> <b>engine</b> <b>advertising</b> prices therefore reflect willingness to pay for context, unlike traditional ad prices that reflect willingness to pay for audience demographics. A growing policy debate asks if this marketing strategy merely makes advertising more informative, or whether it also effectively extracts rent from advertisers. To inform this debate and to better understand <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> <b>advertising</b> more generally, we examine advertising prices paid by lawyers for 174 Google search terms in 195 locations and exploit a natural experiment in “ambulance-chaser” regulations across states. Where contingency fee limits exist, the relative price of advertising is $ 2. 27 lower. This suggests that context-based pricing allows prices to reflect heterogeneity in the profitability of customer leads. When lawyers cannot contact a client in writing, the relative price per ad click is $ 0. 93 higher. This suggests that context-based pricing allows prices to reflect heterogeneity in advertisers’ other advertising options, even within a given local market. Thus, our results suggest that <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> <b>advertising</b> does give market power to the media platform; however, this market power is mitigated by substantial competition from offline marketing communications channels. search engines, advertising, market power, advertising prices...|$|E

Despite its increasing importance academic research on this topic is scarce. Several authors have called for more research on how the content of the ad influences its evaluation. This exploratory study builds on this call for more research and examines the impact of evidence type on click-through and conversion rates in a <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> <b>advertising</b> setting. We find that click-through rates are higher for advertisements involving expert evidence and statistical evidence than for advertisements involving causal evidence. On the contrary, we find that causal evidence results in higher conversion rates than other types of evidence. These findings help marketers to fine-tune their advertising in search engines. In particular, if their aim is to attract people to the website, expert evidence and statistical evidence should be used, while causal evidence works best if the main objective is to generate conversion...|$|E

This paper explores changes in Web content by analyzing a crawl of 55, 000 Web pages, selected to represent different user visitation patterns. Although change over long intervals has been explored on random (and potentially unvisited) samples of Web pages, {{little is known}} about the nature of finer grained changes to pages that are actively consumed by users, such as those in our sample. We describe algorithms, analyses, and models for characterizing changes in Web content, focusing on both time (by using hourly and sub-hourly crawls) and structure (by looking at page-, DOM-, and term-level changes). Change rates are higher in our behavior-based sample than found in previous work on randomly sampled pages, with a large portion of pages changing more than hourly. Detailed content and structure analyses identify stable and dynamic content within each page. The understanding of Web change we develop in this paper has implications for tools designed to help people interact with dynamic Web content, such as <b>search</b> <b>engines,</b> <b>advertising,</b> and Web browsers...|$|R
