500|$|At {{the time}} of its initial release, Don't Look Now was {{generally}} well received by critics, although some criticised it for being [...] "arty and mechanical". Jay Cocks for Time, wrote that [...] "Don't Look Now is such a rich, complex and subtle experience that it demands more than one viewing", while Variety commented that the film's visual flourishes made it [...] "much more than merely a well-made psycho-horror thriller". Pauline Kael writing for The New Yorker was more reserved in her praise, considering the film to be [...] "the fanciest, most carefully assembled enigma yet put on the screen" [...] but that there was a [...] "distasteful clamminess about the picture", while Gordon Gow of Films and Filming felt that it fell short of the aspirations of Nicolas Roeg's previous two films, Performance and Walkabout, but it was nevertheless a thriller of some depth. Vincent Canby, reviewer for The New York Times, on the other hand, criticised the film for a lack of suspense which he put down to a twist that comes halfway through rather than at the end, and at which point it [...] "stops being suspenseful and becomes an elegant travelogue that treats us to second-sightseeing in Venice". Canby also suggested that second sight was not convincing on screen, since it appeared simply like flash-forward which is a standard story-telling device in films, and concluded that [...] "Not only do you probably have better things to do, but so, I'm <b>sure,</b> <b>do</b> most of the people connected with the film." ...|$|E
