5|$|A midget or fleet {{submarine}} attack. Extensive searches {{immediately following}} the <b>sinking</b> had failed to detect any enemy submarine, and the Allies had made no attempt at claiming the enormous propaganda value of <b>sinking</b> a capital ship in her home anchorage; consequently, this possibility was quickly discounted. Eyewitnesses also spoke of a reddish-brown fireball, which indicated a magazine explosion; this was confirmed during exploration of the wreck by divers.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt {{had three}} {{different}} kinds of pitches: a <b>sinking</b> fastball (which is rare for a lefty), a curveball, and a split. His fastball travelled in the low nineties, and while his curveball was not fast, it had late breaking action and {{got a lot of}} swing-throughs. Affeldt induced groundballs at a high rate with his <b>sinking</b> fastball and could also get the strikeout when the situation called for it.|$|E
5|$|Although several {{survivors}} {{claimed to}} have seen a submarine sail with yellow and red insignia, a Navy inquiry attributed the <b>sinking</b> to a boiler explosion.

30|$|A mobile <b>sink</b> {{is usually}} driven by fuel and/or electricity; that is why, the total travel {{distance}} {{covered by the}} <b>sink</b> throughout the network lifetime should be bounded. When a mobile <b>sink</b> moves from one <b>sink</b> location to another, the probability of data loss is high; so, the distance between two <b>sink</b> locations should be at minimum. Adaptive <b>sink</b> mobility requires that the <b>sink</b> must re-construct the routing table or routing tree at each new location, which takes a specific time. So, a mobile <b>sink</b> should reside for a minimum amount of time at each <b>sink</b> location. The transmission of data from nodes/CHs to a <b>sink</b> only occurs when the <b>sink</b> is not moving, i.e., <b>sink</b> is located at any <b>sink</b> location. Therefore, the sum of stop times in a mobile <b>sink</b> tour should be maximized. There should be a maximum number of stop locations for a mobile <b>sink</b> so that the throughput is maximized.|$|R

5|$|Bouvet capsized {{and sank}} {{in about two}} minutes. The ship was in poor {{condition}} at the time due to her age, which likely contributed to her rapid <b>sinking,</b> though there was some speculation that her ammunition magazine exploded.

30|$|Firstly, {{the first}} {{solution}} differs in memory required.

5|$|In December 1943, {{following}} official protests, the Japanese government {{issued a}} statement formally denying responsibility for the <b>sinking</b> of Centaur. Records provided by the Japanese following the war also did not acknowledge responsibility. Although Centaurs <b>sinking</b> was a war crime, no one was tried for <b>sinking</b> the hospital ship. Investigations into the attack were conducted between 1944 and 1948, and included the interrogation of the commanders of the submarines operating in Australian waters at the time, their superiors, plus junior officers and crewmen from the submarines who had survived the war. Several of the investigators suspected that Nakagawa and I-177 were most likely responsible, but {{they were unable to}} establish this beyond reasonable doubt, and the Centaur case file was closed on 14 December 1948 without any charges laid.|$|E
30|$|In this subsection, {{we propose}} a {{mathematical}} model of <b>sink</b> mobility mobile <b>sink</b> model (MSM) in which we take a single <b>sink</b> that can move to certain <b>sink</b> locations in every round. <b>Sink</b> locations are determined {{at the start of}} every round in our proposed model, in order to increase the network lifetime. Therefore, this model is an adaptive <b>sink</b> mobility model.|$|R
50|$|A butler's <b>sink</b> is a {{rectangular}} ceramic <b>sink</b> with a rounded rim {{which is set}} into a work surface. There are generally two kinds of butler's sinks: The London <b>sink</b> and the Belfast <b>sink.</b> In 2006, both types of <b>sinks</b> usually were 61 cm across and 46 cm front-to-back, with a depth of 22.5 cm. London <b>sinks</b> were originally shallower than Belfast <b>sinks.</b> (One plumbing guide in 1921 suggested that the Belfast <b>sink</b> was 38 cm deep.) Some believe this was because London had less access to fresh water (and thus a greater need to conserve water), but this theory is now contested. It is more likely the two <b>sinks</b> had different roles within the household. But that difference usually {{does not exist in}} the modern era, and both <b>sinks</b> are now shallow. The primary difference both in the past and today between a Belfast and London <b>sink</b> is that the Belfast <b>sink</b> is fitted with an overflow weir which prevented water from spilling over the <b>sink's</b> edge by draining it away and down into the wastewater plumbing.|$|R
30|$|In[1] the MSEP ({{multiple}} static <b>sinks</b> edge placement) {{model is}} discussed. In this model the multiple <b>sinks</b> {{are located on}} the same edge. In the MSEP model, different strategies for sending data to the <b>sink</b> are possible, namely, sending data to all the <b>sinks</b> (all <b>sink</b> notification), sending data to closest <b>sink</b> (closest <b>sink</b> notification) or sending data to interested <b>sinks</b> only (interested <b>sink</b> notification). Because {{in the first and}} last strategy the total amount of packets increases, the paper only focuses on the closest <b>sink</b> notification. In a first case of non-overlapping critical zones, they state that in a n-sink environment where the <b>sinks</b> serve an equal part of the network, the nodes in the critical zone deplete at the same time. However, for large networks still a large amount of energy is unutilised. If the <b>sinks</b> do not serve an equal part of the network, the network first will behave as one-sink networks which serve their part of the network and with equal initial energy capacity. Once the nodes in the critical zone of <b>sinks</b> get depleted, the network will behave as a network with only one <b>sink</b> with a smaller initial energy capacity. The adding of extra <b>sinks</b> on the same edge can lead to the overlapping of the critical regions. This situation is called the full-edge <b>sink</b> placement. In this situation still 50 % of the energy is not used. These results also apply on the multiple static <b>sinks</b> with random placement (MSRP) model for large networks with {{a relatively small number of}} <b>sinks.</b>|$|R
5|$|In October and November 1944, Christie {{received}} intelligence regarding German {{plans to}} operate a wolfpack of U-boats in Australian waters.

Another U-boat disappeared en route while a fourth, U-862, evaded searchers to slip around the south coast of Australia and sink a Liberty ship south of Sydney in late December.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the <b>sinking,</b> Royal Oaks survivors were billeted in the towns and villages of Orkney. A funeral parade for the dead took place at Lyness on Hoy on 16 October; many of the surviving crew, having lost all their own clothing on the ship, attended in borrowed boiler suits and gym shoes. They were generally granted a few days survivors' leave by the navy, and then assigned to ships and roles elsewhere. Kenneth Toop, who survived the <b>sinking</b> while serving as a Boy, First Class on Royal Oak, served as the Royal Oak Association's Honorary Secretary. An annual ceremony of remembrance is held by the survivors and descendants of the crew at the Naval War Memorial, Southsea, on the anniversary of the <b>sinking.</b> The last remaining survivor of Royal Oak, Arthur Smith, who had been a 17-year old Boy, First Class when the ship was struck, died on 11 December 2016. He had been on watch at the bridge and had jumped from the <b>sinking</b> ship, swimming in the wrong direction until he was picked up by a boat and transferred to the Daisy 2.|$|E

30|$|Traditional static WSN systems use a n-to- 1 {{communication}} paradigm in which sensors forward their data towards a common static <b>sink.</b> However, deploying one static <b>sink</b> limits the network lifetime as the close neighbors of the <b>sink</b> {{can become the}} bottlenecks of the network. Multiple <b>sinks</b> deployment helps to spread load over the network, while mobility of <b>sinks</b> reduces the bottleneck problem of static <b>sinks.</b> Exploiting multiple, mobile <b>sinks</b> in a WSN, instead of static ones, is thus an interesting concept to enhance the network lifetime by avoiding excessive transmission at the nodes that {{are close to the}} location of the static <b>sink.</b>|$|R

30|$|Since {{the sensor}} nodes {{are not aware}} of the {{existence}} of multiple <b>sinks,</b> they will send their information to the virtual <b>sink.</b> It is the task of the different <b>sinks</b> to intercept this information and handle it themselves (as the virtual <b>sink</b> does not physically exist). An easy solution for this is to assign an identical anycast address[20] to all the <b>sinks</b> and use this as the address of the virtual <b>sink.</b> When a sensor node wants to contact the virtual <b>sink,</b> it will use this anycast address which will make sure that one of the different <b>sinks</b> will process the data.|$|R
