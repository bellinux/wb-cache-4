50|$|In finance, a <b>strangle</b> is an {{investment}} strategy involving the purchase or sale of particular option derivatives that allows the holder to profit based on how much {{the price of the}} underlying security moves, with relatively minimal exposure to the direction of price movement. A purchase of particular options is known as a long <b>strangle,</b> while a sale of the same options is known as a short <b>strangle.</b> As an options position <b>strangle</b> is a variation of a more generic straddle position. <b>Strangle's</b> key difference from a straddle is in giving investor choice of balancing cost of opening a <b>strangle</b> versus a probability of profit. For example, given the same underlying security, <b>strangle</b> positions can be constructed with low cost and low probability of profit. Low cost is relative and comparable to a cost of straddle on the same underlying.Strangles can be used with equity options, index options or options on futures.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generalisation of McKean's free {{boundary value problem}} for American options by considering an American <b>strangle</b> position, where the early exercise of {{one side of the}} payoff will knock-out the out-of-the-money side. When attempting to evaluate the price of this American <b>strangle,</b> it is not correct to simply price the component American call and put options which make up the <b>strangle,</b> and take the sum of their values. The Fourier transform technique is used to derive the integral equation for the price of our American <b>strangle.</b> From this expression, a coupled integral equation system for the <b>strangle's</b> call- and put-side free boundaries is found. While the equation for the price of the <b>strangle</b> is simply the sum of its component American call and put option equations, the free boundary for each side is shown to have a more complex nature. A numerical algorithm for solving the coupled integral equation system for the free boundaries is provided, and the resulting approximations are used to determine the price of the American <b>strangle</b> position. Numerical comparisons between the <b>strangle</b> price and the price of a portfolio formed from a long position in both an American call an American put option are presented.

5000|$|A short <b>strangle</b> is {{effectively}} a long iron condor, {{but without the}} wings. It is constructed by writing an out-of-the-money put and an out-of-the money call.

Oriental bittersweet is also present along the river, {{and it is}} slowly displacing the native American bittersweet. Oriental bitterweet can also form hybrids with the native bittersweet and making identification harder. Japanese honeysuckle and Japanese knotweed are two other invasive vines native to Asia. In addition, purple loosestrife, a perennial herb with magenta flower stalks, is also present along the river.|$|E

5|$|The ballet {{has been}} {{variously}} interpreted and adapted. The 1917 Russian film The Dying Swan by director Yevgeni Bauer, for example, {{tells the story}} of an artist who <b>strangles</b> a ballerina.

More recently, Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo perform a parody version that emphasizes every excess dormant in the choreography, and, in 2000, street theatre artist Judith Lanigan created a hula hoop act based on the Fokine/Pavlova ballet divertissement that has been performed at international street theatre festivals, comedy and burlesque events, and in traditional and contemporary-style circuses.|$|E

Fox's standards and practices department fought with the producers over the scene where Barnett <b>strangles</b> Reggie Purdue, {{and as a result}} the producers were forced to reduce the length of the scene. The footage of the young girl with progeria was filmed after the production crew contacted the Progeria Society and were put in touch with the family of Courtney Arciaga, who was a young girl with the disease. She and her family were fans of the series, and were flown from their San Diego home to Vancouver to shoot the scene.|$|E
