5|$|In 1887, James W. Bryan vacated {{his seat}} in the Kentucky Senate to pursue the office of {{lieutenant}} governor. Goebel decided to seek election to the vacant seat representing the Covington area. His platform of railroad regulation and championing labor causes, combined with the influence of Stevenson, his former partner, <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> Goebel an easy victory, {{but this was not}} to be. A third political party, the Union Labor party, had risen to power in the area with a platform similar to Goebel's. However, while Goebel had to stick close to his allies in the Democratic party, the Union Labor party courted the votes of both Democrats and Republicans, and made the election closedecided in Goebel's favor by a mere fifty-six votes.|$|E
5|$|The sixteenth {{episode of}} Gundam SEED {{features}} {{a scene in}} which Kira Yamato is seen dressing after getting out of a bed where the teenage girl Flay Allster lies sleeping naked, suggesting a sexual relationship. The Japanese Commission for Better Broadcasting reported that viewers filed complaints regarding the scene as the show was aired at 6pm when children would be watching. Mainichi replied by mentioning it <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> more careful consideration to the episode before airing it. The scene was extended in one of the compilation films with John Oppliger noting it expanded the off-screen scene with three shots.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{problems}} of the partial aether-dragging hypothesis, another major problem arose with the Michelson–Morley experiment (1887). In Fresnel's theory, the aether is almost stationary, so the experiment <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> a positive result. However, the result of this experiment was negative. Thus from the viewpoint of the aether models at that time, the experimental situation was contradictory: On one hand, the aberration of light, the Fizeau experiment and the repetition by Michelson and Morley in 1886 appeared to support partial aether-dragging. On the other hand, the Michelson–Morley experiment of 1887 appeared to prove that the aether is at rest with respect to Earth, apparently supporting the idea of complete aether-dragging (see aether drag hypothesis). So the very success of Fresnel's hypothesis in explaining Fizeau's results helped lead to a theoretical crisis, which was not resolved until the development of the theory of special relativity.|$|E

25|$|Burns was {{offended}} by accusations from labor supporters {{that he had}} planted the evidence that he had seized at the union headquarters in Indianapolis. He was particularly critical of Samuel Gompers. Burns {{did not believe that}} Gompers was part of the dynamite plot, but blamed Gompers for being irresponsible in accusing Burns of framing the McNamaras, in the face of overwhelming evidence. Burns wrote that Gompers could not have been unaware of the four-year dynamiting campaign, which <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> him pause.|$|E
25|$|Tihipko {{chaired the}} {{election}} campaign in 2004 for presidential candidate Viktor Yanukovych. After the election Tihipko temporarily left Ukrainian politics, resigning as Labour Ukraine leader on 23 April 2005, {{to build up a}} bank which he sold to Swedbank group for nearly $1 billion. Tihipko was an ally of former President Leonid Kuchma. Analysts have claimed Kuchma <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> his support to Tihipko during the Ukrainian presidential elections, 2004 instead of supporting Viktor Yanukovych, however Yanukovych had more popular support.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} this rejection, Agassiz embarked on geological fieldwork. He published his book Study on Glaciers ("Études sur les glaciers") in 1840. De Charpentier was put out by this, as he had also been preparing {{a book about the}} glaciation of the Alps. De Charpentier felt that Agassiz <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> him precedence as it was he who had introduced Agassiz to in-depth glacial research. Besides that, Agassiz had, as a result of personal quarrels, omitted any mention of Schimper in his book.|$|E

25|$|Australia {{nearly lost}} their quarter-final match on 18 October, {{requiring}} a controversial last-minute penalty from Foley to beat Scotland 35–34. The decision by referee Craig Joubert to award a penalty was later deemed incorrect by World Rugby, who {{issued a statement}} saying Joubert <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> a scrum instead. Despite this, Australia went on to the semi-final and faced Argentina. They defeated the Pumas 29–15, to reach the final, to become the second team, after New Zealand, to make four Rugby World Cup finals, having previously played in the 1991, 1999 and 2003 finals.|$|E
25|$|The match had {{the most}} yellow cards awarded in a World Cup final, more than {{doubling}} the previous record for a final, set when Argentina and West Germany shared six cards in 1986. Fourteen yellow cards were awarded (nine for the Netherlands and five for Spain), and John Heitinga of the Netherlands was sent off for receiving a second yellow card. One yellow card was for Nigel de Jong's studs-up kick to the chest of Xabi Alonso during the first half, for which Rob Hughes of The New York Times, among others, believed the referee <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> a red card. The referee, Howard Webb, later said after reviewing the foul {{that it should have}} been a red card, but that his view during play was partially obstructed.|$|E
500|$|Mackintosh had two daughters, {{the second}} born {{while he was}} in Australia {{awaiting}} the Aurora's departure. On the return Barrier journey in February 1916, expecting to die, he wrote a [...] farewell message, with echoes of Captain Scott. The message concludes: [...] "If it is God's will that we <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> up our lives then we do so in the British manner as our tradition holds us in honour bound to do. Goodbye, friends. I feel sure that my dear wife and children will not be neglected." [...] In 1923, Gladys Mackintosh married Joseph Stenhouse, Auroras first officer and later captain.|$|E

In a recreation of an infamous incident at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, Kanye West briefly appeared on stage during {{the presentation of the}} Album of the Year award to Becks Morning Phase (2014) in protest of Beyoncé not winning. While it initially appeared to be a joke as West returned to his seat, he said in comments following the ceremony that Beck [...] "needs to respect artistry and he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> his award to Beyoncé". He later apologized for his comments.|$|E

MacDonald's division stopped at Düsseldorf while Castelverd's was placed in the French line on the lower Lahn. These reinforcements brought Jourdan's strength up to 50,000, which <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> him an edge on Charles, except his abandonment of the sieges at Mainz, and later Mannheim and Philippsburg released 16,200 and 11,630 Habsburg troops (respectively) to reinforce Charles' already overwhelming numbers.|$|E

500|$|In 1885, he {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} a Department of Labor, which he suggested would find a solution to disputes between labor and management. Labor tensions increased the following year as the Knights of Labor went on strike against Jay Gould's rail empire, and a strike against the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company ended in the bloody Haymarket riot. Weaver believed the nation's hard-money policies were responsible for labor unrest, calling it [...] "purely a question of money, and nothing else" [...] and declaring, [...] "If this Congress will not protect labor, it must protect itself". He saw the triumph of one plank of the Greenback platform when Congress established the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate the railroads. Weaver thought the bill <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> the government more power, including the ability to set rates directly, but he voted for the final bill.|$|E
500|$|The {{stewards}} immediately {{investigated the}} accident between Webber and Hamilton on lap 37and took no further action. Hamilton later reviewed the incident on video and was adamant {{that he was}} not at fault saying that he was [...] "unlucky" [...] for the second consecutive Grand Prix. Webber stated the contact nearly forced him to retire and compared the accident to Hamilton's collision with Massa at the Italian Grand Prix. Brundle felt Hamilton <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> Webber more space and agreed with the stewards' decision. Bridgestone director of motorsport tyre development Hirohide Hamashima stated Webber was [...] "very lucky" [...] to make the finish and that if left hand high-speed corners were installed on the track, the tyre would have moved more frequently and lost its pressure. Horner had also admitted that Webber had been lucky with his tyre lasting for a long distance.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} after the 1906 election, Shaw felt that the Fabians needed fresh leadership, and saw this {{in the form of}} his fellow-writer H. G. Wells, who had joined the society in February 1903. Wells's ideas for reform—particularly his {{proposals}} for closer cooperation with the Independent Labour Party—placed him at odds with the society's [...] "Old Gang", led by Shaw. According to Cole, Wells [...] "had minimal capacity for putting [...] across in public meetings against Shaw's trained and practised virtuosity". In Shaw's view, [...] "the Old Gang did not extinguish Mr Wells, he annihilated himself". Wells resigned from the society in September 1908; Shaw remained a member, but left the executive in April 1911. He later wondered whether the Old Gang <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> way to Wells some years earlier: [...] "God only knows whether the Society had not better have done it". Although less active—he blamed his advancing years—Shaw remained a Fabian.|$|E

500|$|Gernsback hired Sam Moskowitz to {{edit the}} new magazine, and {{produced}} a dummy issue in November 1952 that was never distributed or intended for sale; it was printed for trademark purposes, and contained only stories by Gernsback himself, under his own name and several pseudonyms. [...] The first issue produced for sale was dated March 1953. [...] It was a slick, meaning {{that it was in}} large format and was printed on high-quality paper; this was a step up from the cheap paper used in the leading science fiction magazines of the day, and sf historian Mike Ashley notes that in theory this <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> Gernsback a marketing edge. [...] The price, 35 cents, was also competitive. [...] Sales were initially good, and Science-Fiction Plus remained on a monthly schedule until June, but when the circulation began to slip, the magazine became bimonthly beginning with the August issue. [...] Gernsback distributed Science-Fiction Plus along with his technical magazines, and if the circulation of the new magazine had been comparable to that of his other titles, it would have been profitable despite the more expensive slick paper, but sales were insufficient for it to continue. [...] In October Gernsback cut costs by switching to cheaper pulp paper, but only one further issue, dated December 1953, appeared.|$|E

On February 26, 2015, he publicly apologized to Beck on Twitter. On August 30, 2015, West was presented with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the MTV Video Music Awards. In his acceptance speech, he stated, [...] "Y'all might be thinking right now, 'I wonder did he smoke something before he came out here?' And the answer is: 'Yes, I rolled up a little something.
