30|$|In our study, we also {{collected}} free associations to {{the terms}} <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> and disability. We found that <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> is associated with more negativity than disability; <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> conjures up more associations to developmental disabilities (such as intellectual disability, autism, or Down syndrome) whereas disability {{is associated with a}} broader, more inclusive set of disabilities; and <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> evokes more unanswered questions than disability. These associations again demonstrate that <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> is an ineffective euphemism. We propose that <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> is an ineffective euphemism because it is imprecise, it connotes segregation, and it implies <b>special</b> rights; <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> has become a dysphemism.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} number of {{foreign-born}} adopted children with <b>Special</b> <b>Needs.</b> Despite this increase little is known about these adopted children and their needs. It is important to find answers to the following questions: 1. Are there differences between adopted children from Taiwan with <b>Special</b> <b>Needs</b> and adopted children from Taiwan without <b>Special</b> <b>Needs,</b> concerning problem behavior? 2. Are there differences between adopted children from Taiwan and adopted children from China, concerning problem behavior? 3. Are there differences between adopted children from Taiwan with <b>Special</b> <b>Needs</b> and adopted children from China with <b>Special</b> <b>Needs,</b> concerning problem behavior? Through sending adoptive parents questionnaires, data was obtained from 310 adopted children from Taiwan. These data were compared with data from a comparison group consisting of adopted children from China (N = 1233). Problem behavior was studied with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). There were differences between girls with <b>Special</b> <b>Needs</b> from Taiwan and girls without <b>Special</b> <b>Needs</b> from Taiwan: the girls with <b>Special</b> <b>Needs</b> tended to have more problems with peers (SDQ), to have more internalizing problems (CBCL) and more total problem behavior (CBCL) than the girls without <b>Special</b> <b>Needs.</b> Boys with <b>Special</b> <b>Needs</b> from Taiwan also showed more internalizing problems (CBCL) than boys without <b>Special</b> <b>Needs</b> from Taiwan. Although „Special Needs‟ is considered to be something purely physical, both boys and girls with <b>Special</b> <b>Needs</b> showed more internalizing problems than children without <b>Special</b> <b>Needs.</b> It may be a pitfall to focus help only on the physical problems when helping adopted children with <b>Special</b> <b>Needs.</b> Besides that, girls from Taiwan (with and without <b>Special</b> <b>Needs)</b> showed more problem behavior on several problem scales than the girls from China. Similarly, girls with <b>Special</b> <b>Needs</b> from Taiwan showed more problems (according to the SDQ) than girls with <b>Special</b> <b>Needs</b> from China. This means that extra attention should be given to problem behavior from girls from Taiwan...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of adopted {{children}} with <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> in the Netherlands has increased, while {{the total number of}} adopted children has declined. Because of this shift, adoption agency Meiling requested an exploratory study on the welfare of adopted children with <b>special</b> <b>needs.</b> In this study parents of adopted children from Taiwan have been questioned by using a digital questionnaire. The research question of this thesiswas: “Are there differences in the care of adopted children from Taiwan with and without special ?” To answer this question, the Leiden classification of <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> was used to specify the <b>special</b> <b>needs.</b> This classification focuses on physical/medical impairments of children. This resulted in two groups: 131 adopted children with <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> and 179 children without <b>special</b> <b>needs.</b> The results of this study showed that adopted children with <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> were more likely to show developmental delays than adopted children without <b>special</b> <b>needs,</b> both when they were placed for adoption and {{at the time of the}} study. Also, adopted children with <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> used more guidance and support from different agencies, such as physiotherapy, remedial teaching, speech therapy, and health care than adopted children without <b>special</b> <b>needs.</b> Adopted children with <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> attended <b>special</b> education more frequently and/or needed more additional adjustments in school than adopted children without <b>special</b> <b>needs.</b> Adoptive parents of children with <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> used health insurance, provided additional funding themselves, and received a personal budget (PGB) more often than adoptive parents of children without <b>special</b> <b>needs.</b> When adopted children with <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> from Taiwan were compared with adopted children with <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> from China (N = 189), the results showed that they did not differ in developmental delays at the time of placement nor at the moment of the study. However, adoptive parents of children with <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> from Taiwan more frequently used physical therapy, education and support around temporary assistance / care. From these findings, recommendations for practice are made, such as providing maternity care after the adoption, better collaboration between different agencies, specializing in adopted children with <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> by professionals and long-term follow-up care for adopted children with medical problems, possibly leading to developmental delay. Finally, it is concluded that further research is necessary to gain information about the development of adopted children with <b>special</b> <b>needs.</b> Longitudinal studies, using the Leiden Classification of <b>special</b> <b>needs,</b> are of interest...|$|R

30|$|Although euphemisms are {{intended}} to put a more positive spin on the words they replace, some euphemisms are ineffective. Our study examined {{the effectiveness of a}} popular euphemism for persons with disabilities, <b>special</b> <b>needs.</b> Most style guides prescribe against using the euphemism <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> and recommend instead using the non-euphemized term disability; disability advocates argue adamantly against the euphemism <b>special</b> <b>needs,</b> which they find offensive. In contrast, many parents of children with disabilities prefer to use <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> rather than disability. But no empirical study has examined whether <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> is more or less positive than the term it replaces. Therefore, we gathered a sample of adult participants from the general population (N[*]=[*] 530) and created a set of vignettes that allowed us to measure how positively children, college students, and middle-age adults are viewed when they are described as having <b>special</b> <b>needs,</b> having a disability, having a certain disability (e.g., is blind, has Down syndrome), or with no label at all. We predicted and observed that persons are viewed more negatively when described as having <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> than when described as having a disability or having a certain disability, indicating that <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> is an ineffective euphemism. Even for members of the general population who have a personal connection to disability (e.g., as parents of children with disabilities), the euphemism <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> is no more effective than the non-euphemized term disability. We also collected free associations to the terms <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> and disability and found that <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> is associated with more negativity; <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> conjures up more associations with developmental disabilities (such as intellectual disability) whereas disability is associated with a more inclusive set of disabilities; and <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> evokes more unanswered questions.

If <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> was an effective euphemism, then we would have observed that characters described as having <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> were chosen last less often than characters described as having a disability or a certain disability.

The intention of this Master’s degree is to research the position of siblings of children with <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> through theoretical analysis and analysis of the interviews and to form a basic starting point for development of help and support programme for siblings, which could also be formed in Slovenian region. We carried out interviews with 30 siblings, who were 8 to 13 years old, with the intention of researching their needs. We had discovered that siblings know their brothers and sisters with <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> well and in their freeform descriptions they mainly focused on describing their siblings personalities and the matters that siblings like. 24 siblings noticed <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> of their brother or sister with <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> on their own and later asked their parents about it. Sole information source for siblings are their parents, siblings also stated, {{that they do not have}} any questions, which they would be afraid to ask. Analysis of the answers showed 6 different styles of play between siblings. Almost half of siblings adjust their style of play to <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> of their brother or sister, some of them direct the game to their sibling with <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> or they try to motivate them to play. Siblings also direct and lead the play and in certain cases arrange for more safety and look out for their brother or sister with <b>special</b> <b>needs.</b> Siblings help with personal care, safeguarding, assistance (bringing and giving things, escorting to school, positioning into the chair) and with teaching, food serving and feeding. We made further statistical analysis about sibling help and play, which showed that regarding nursing there were not statistically significant differences about siblings gender or the order of birth. If the sibling was older or younger also did not have any influence on the form of play and activities between them. Higher or lower age of siblings of brothers or sisters with <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> however did have an influence on the style of the game. Even if they were younger, siblings still gave care, assistance, feeding and consolation to their brother or sister with <b>special</b> <b>needs.</b> This points to potential role asymmetry, which is characteristical attribute of the relationship in which one sibling has <b>special</b> <b>needs.</b> 20 siblings stated that their peers accepted their brother or sister with <b>special</b> <b>needs,</b> the rest faced minor or major difficulties on that subject. Peers asked siblings questions about their brother or sister with <b>special</b> <b>needs,</b> which they did not always knew how to answer. Regarding positive experiences of living with brother or sister with <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> they mentioned good relations, pride and admiration for their brother or sister with <b>special</b> <b>needs.</b> Regarding negative experiences of living with brother or sister with <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> they mentioned disruptive behavior of their brother or sister with <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> and mocking and staring of other people.
