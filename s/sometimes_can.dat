The Jahn-Teller effect is a distortion of a molecule of high symmetry when it adopts a particular ground state of lower symmetry from a set of possible ground states {{that are related to}} each other by the symmetry operations of the molecule.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez {{throws a}} fastball that travels about ninety-one mph for his main pitch, though it <b>sometimes</b> <b>can</b> {{go up to}} ninety-five mph. His other pitches (slurve and change-up) travel in the low eighties. Wildness {{has been a problem}} for Sánchez; he has walked 10% – 15% of major-league batters faced each season. However, he also strikes out a lot of batters; he struck out two hundred {{for the first time in}} his career in 2010. That year, he led all {{qualifying}} MLB starting pitchers in limiting hits per innings pitched (6.61 H/9), and his career swinging-strike percentage is among the best in the majors.|$|E
5|$|The {{combat system}} in Dwarf Fortress is anatomically detailed. Combat is {{displayed}} by viewing the log which describes each weapon striking a specific {{part of the}} character's body. Internal organs can get punctured, combatants can fall to the ground, vomit and lose body parts. Each dwarf has individually detailed limbs, each with damageable bone, fat, muscle and skin. Fat can be bruised without breaking bones and vice versa. Injuries <b>sometimes</b> <b>can</b> be permanent. There is a medical system where a hospital {{can be set up}} containing crutches for disabled dwarves, traction benches, plasters and cloth for casts and bandages, thread for suturing, and splints.|$|E

5|$|The eggs hatch after 53 to 60days of {{incubation}} by both parents. Chicks {{are born}} with their eyes open and <b>sometimes</b> <b>can</b> take {{up to a week}} to leave the shell completely. The young are covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after five to six months, but continue to roost and forage with their parents until they are in their second year, at which point the parents typically turn their energies to a new nest. Ravens are the main predatory threat to condor eggs, while golden eagles and bears are potential predators of condor offspring.|$|E
5|$|Aerox at Destructoid {{said that}} the game {{inherits}} issues from previous Ace Attorney games, such as how evidence <b>sometimes</b> <b>can</b> only be presented when the game's script allows it, and how it sometimes is unclear how to trigger events during investigations; he did however note that these occur less frequently than in previous Ace Attorney games. Osborn criticized the cross-examinations, saying that objections that should logically be valid are sometimes not accepted by the game, and that the player often has to resort to trial and error. Meanwhile, Bryan Vore at Game Informer {{said that the}} in-game task list and new way of traveling made sure that he never felt lost during investigations, and {{knew what to do}} to proceed. Urara Honma at Famitsu also noted the hints and lower difficulty as helpful features.|$|E

25|$|These morphemes {{contained}} both semantic and semiological information (non-base morphemes only contained semiological information). They {{could occur}} as either free bases, {{which did not}} need affixes, and bound bases, which only occurred with affixes. However, free bases could be designated different parts of speech (verbs, nouns, etc.) based on the affixes attached, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>can</b> be used indifferently as any one with no change.|$|E

25|$|The {{sulfanilamide}} compound is {{more active}} in the protonated form. The drug has very low solubility and <b>sometimes</b> <b>can</b> crystallize in the kidneys, due to its first pKa of around 10. This is a very painful experience, so patients are told to take the medication with copious amounts of water. Newer analogous compounds prevent this complication {{because they have a}} lower pKa, around 5–6, making them more likely to remain in a soluble form.|$|E
25|$|A right-arm fast-medium bowler {{capable of}} {{generating}} good pace with late swing, he {{is a genuine}} strike bowler. Although he was prone to leaking runs in his earlier career, of late he has used vast county experience to be economical in death overs. He often bowls the reverse-swinging yorker in one day and T20 cricket and has good control over changes of pace, though he <b>sometimes</b> <b>can</b> be expensive. Rana is also a useful attacking lower-order batsman with 5 first-class centuries and many fifties, including a score of 95 in 57 balls in a T20 game which lifted his team Sialkot Stallions to the tournament final. He left playing cricket {{due to personal reasons}} during 1995–1999.|$|E
25|$|CM applied {{over the}} life cycle of a system {{provides}} visibility and control of its performance, functional, and physical attributes. CM verifies that a system performs as intended, and is identified and documented in sufficient detail to support its projected life cycle. The CM process facilitates orderly management of system information and system changes for such beneficial purposes as to revise capability; improve performance, reliability, or maintainability; extend life; reduce cost; reduce risk and liability; or correct defects. The relatively minimal cost of implementing CM is returned many fold in cost avoidance. The lack of CM, or its ineffectual implementation, can be very expensive and <b>sometimes</b> <b>can</b> have such catastrophic consequences such as failure of equipment or loss of life.|$|E

25|$|Since women {{almost never}} {{participate}} in traditional dances, scenes that involve female characters are played by young men wearing masks. Masks for female characters usually portray a modest and virtuous woman who abides by society’s norms. La Malinche, interpreter for Cortés, {{is most often}} shown this way, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>can</b> be depicted as a sexy woman, with a mask that shows gaudy makeup. Other non-conformist women include antisocial characters such as “Las Viudas” (The Widows) of Carnival in Nezquipayac and La Borracha (The Drunk Woman) from the Danza del Torito in Guanajuato. Masks for these characters are unflattering. Another example is the La Marignuilla (Little Mary) of the Purépecha, who imitates city women, whose life is considered immoral by the indigenous. This mask depicts thick make up and wears a tight dress.|$|E
25|$|All {{individuals}} with A-T {{should have at}} least one comprehensive immunologic evaluation that measures the number and type of lymphocytes in the blood (T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes), the levels of serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM) and antibody responses to T-dependent (e.g., tetanus, Hemophilus influenzae b) and T-independent (23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide) vaccines. For the most part, the pattern of immunodeficiency seen in an A-T patient early in life (by age five) will be the same pattern seen throughout the lifetime of that individual. Therefore, the tests need not be repeated unless that individual develops more problems with infection. Problems with immunity <b>sometimes</b> <b>can</b> be overcome by immunization. Vaccines against common bacterial respiratory pathogens such as Hemophilus influenzae, pneumococci and influenza virus (the “flu”) are commercially available and often help to boost antibody responses, even in {{individuals with}} low immunoglobulin levels. If the vaccines do not work and the patient continues to have problems with infections, gamma globulin therapy (IV or subcutaneous infusions of antibodies collected from normal individuals) may be of benefit. A small number of people with A-T develop an abnormality in which one or more types of immunoglobulin are increased far beyond the normal range. In a few cases, the immunoglobulin levels can be increased so much that the blood becomes thick and does not flow properly. Therapy for this problem must be tailored to the specific abnormality found and its severity.|$|E
500|$|The phrase [...] "Charon’s obol" [...] as used by archaeologists <b>sometimes</b> <b>can</b> be {{understood}} as referring to a particular religious rite, but often serves {{as a kind of}} shorthand for coinage as grave goods presumed to further the deceased's passage into the afterlife. In Latin, Charon's obol sometimes is called a viaticum, or [...] "sustenance for the journey"; the placement of the coin on the mouth has been explained also as a seal to protect the deceased's soul or to prevent it from returning.|$|E

500|$|Kafka {{often made}} {{extensive}} use of a characteristic particular to the German language which permits long sentences that <b>sometimes</b> <b>can</b> span an entire page. Kafka's sentences then deliver an unexpected impact just before the full stop—this being the finalizing meaning and focus. This {{is due to the}} construction of subordinate clauses in German which require that the verb be positioned {{at the end of the}} sentence. Such constructions are difficult to duplicate in English, so it is up to the translator to provide the reader with the same (or at least equivalent) effect found in the original text. German's more flexible word order and syntactical differences provide for multiple ways in which the same German writing can be translated into English. An example is the first sentence of Kafka's [...] "The Metamorphosis", which is crucial to the setting and understanding of the entire story: ...|$|E
500|$|From Harbor Springs on, M-119 is the Tunnel of Trees Scenic Heritage Route, {{one of the}} Pure Michigan Byways in the state. Bluff Drive becomes Lake Shore Drive {{near the}} Harbor Point Golf Course, and M-119 turns northward to follow the Lake Michigan {{shoreline}} {{at the mouth of}} Little Traverse Bay. The roadway meanders through oaks, maples, birch and cedars along an old Ottawa trail. The writers at National Geographic said that [...] "only <b>sometimes</b> <b>can</b> you catch glimmers of Lake Michigan through the trees, but the dense foliage lends beauty to the winding road." [...] Along this area of the routing, the highway narrows in width and continues through the forest without a centerline most of the remainder of the way. As the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) states on their website, [...] "M-119 is not a road for those in a hurry." [...] the trunkline continues through the community of Good Hart up the Lake Michigan shoreline to the community of Cross Village. M-119, and state maintenance, end at the intersection between Lake Shore Drive and C-66/C-77 (State Road) in the middle of town.|$|E
