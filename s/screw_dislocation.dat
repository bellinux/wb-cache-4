40|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>dislocations</b> in Al-rich AlGaN/AlN quantum wells cause growth spirals with an {{enhanced}} Ga incorporation, which create potential minima. Although <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations</b> and their surrounding potential minima suggest non-radiative recombination processes within growth spirals, in reality, <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations</b> are not major non-radiative sinks for carriers. Consequently, carriers localized within growth spirals recombine radiatively without being captured by non-radiative recombination centers, resulting in intense emissions from growth spirals...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of dislocations in {{crystals}} that can induce slip - edge <b>dislocations</b> and <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations.</b> Edge dislocations have the direction of the burgers vector perpendicular to the <b>dislocation</b> line, while <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations</b> have the direction of the burgers vector parallel to the dislocation line. The type of dislocations generated largely depends on the direction of the applied stress, temperature and other factors. <b>Screw</b> <b>dislocations</b> can easily cross slip from one plane to another if the other slip plane contains the direction of the burgers vector.|$|R

50|$|A <b>screw</b> <b>{{dislocation}}</b> is {{a common}} dislocation that transforms successive atomic planes within a crystal lattice {{into the shape of}} a helix. Once a <b>screw</b> <b>dislocation</b> propagates through the bulk of a sample during the wafer growth process, a micropipe is formed. The presence of a high density of micropipes within a wafer will result in a loss of yield in the device manufacturing process.|$|E

The role of the boundary of a finite mesoscopic smectic is to provide a mechanism for the existence of thermodynamically stable <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations.</b> We obtain a closed expression for the corresponding free energy and a relation between the applied twist and the number of <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations.</b> Comment: 4 pages, 2 eps figure...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that SiC wafer quality deficiencies are delaying {{the realization of}} outstandingly superior 4 H-SiC power electronics. While efforts to date have centered on eradicating micropipes (i. e., hollow core super-screw dislocations with Burgers vectors> 2 c), 4 H-SiC wafers and epilayers also contain elementary <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations</b> (i. e., Burgers vector = 1 c with no hollow core) in densities {{on the order of}} thousands per cm 2, nearly 100 -fold micropipe densities. While not nearly as detrimental to SiC device performance as micropipes, it has been previously shown that diodes containing elementary <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations</b> exhibit a 5 % to 35 % reduction in breakdown voltage, higher pre-breakdown reverse leakage current, softer reverse breakdown I-V knee, and concentrated microplasmic breakdown current filaments when measured under DC testing conditions. This paper details the impact of elementary <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations</b> on the experimentally observed reverse-breakdown pulse-failure characteristics of low-voltage (< 250 V) small-area (< 5 x 10 - 4 cm 2) 4 H-SiC p+n diodes. The presence of elementary <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations</b> did not significantly affect the failure properties of these diodes when subjected to non-adiabatic breakdown-bias pulsewidths ranging from 0. 1 m s to 20 m s in duration. Diodes with and without elementary <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations</b> exhibited positive temperature coefficient of breakdown voltage and high junction failure power densities well above the failure power densities exhibited by highly reliable silicon power rectifiers. This preliminary result, based on measurements from one wafer of SiC diodes, suggests that highly reliable low-voltage SiC rectifiers may be attainable despite the presence of elementary <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Given the {{high-density}} (104 cm 2) {{of elementary}} <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations</b> (Burgers vector = 1 c with no hollow core) in commercial SiC wafers and epilayers, all large current (> 1 A) SiC power devices will likely contain elementary <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations</b> {{for the foreseeable}} future. It is therefore important to ascertain the electrical impact of these defects, particularly in high-field vertical power device topologies where SiC is expected to enable large performance improvements in solid-state high-power sys-tems. This paper compares the dc-measured reverse-breakdown characteristics of low-voltage (< 250 V) small-area (< 5 104 cm 2) 4 H–SiC p+n diodes with and without elementary <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations.</b> Diodes containing elementary <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations</b> exhibited higher pre-breakdown reverse leakage currents, softer reverse breakdown current–voltage (IV) knees, and highly localized microplasmic breakdown current filaments compared to screw dislocation-free devices.

The annealing process is simulated by stirring the bubble raft. This anneals out the dislocations (recovery) and promotes recrystallization.|$|E

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{equilibrium}} core structures (denoted symmetric and asymmetric) for 1 / 2 a <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations</b> in bcc metals {{have been found}} in atomistic simulations. In asymmetric (or polarized) cores, the central three atoms simultaneously translate along the Burgers vector direction. This collective displacement of core atoms is called polarization. In contrast, symmetric (nonpolarized) cores have zero core polarization. To examine the possible role of dislocation core in kink-pair formation process, we studied the multiplicity, structural features, and formation energies of 1 / 3 a kinks in 1 / 2 a <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations</b> with different core structures. To do this we used a family of embedded atom model potentials for tantalum (Ta) all of which reproduce bulk properties (density, cohesive energy, and elastic constants) from quantum mechanics calculations but differ in the resulting polarization of 1 / 2 a <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations.</b> For dislocations with asymmetric core, there are two energy equivalent core configurations [with positive (P) and negative (N) polarization], leading to 2 types of (polarization) flips, 8 kinds of isolated kinks, and 16 combinations of kink pairs. We find there are only two elementary kinks, while the others are composites of elementary kinks and flips. In contrast, for <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations</b> with symmetric core, there are only two types of isolated kinks and one kind of kink pair.

The fundamental thermodynamic effect of a <b>screw</b> <b>dislocation</b> is to eliminate this discontinuity in the chemical potential, by making it impossible to ever complete a single crystal face.|$|E
50|$|Thus, for {{sufficiently}} large driving forces, {{the interface}} can move uniformly {{without the benefit}} of either a heterogeneous nucleation or <b>screw</b> <b>dislocation</b> mechanism. What constitutes a sufficiently large driving force depends upon the diffuseness of the interface, so that for extremely diffuse interfaces, this critical driving force will be so small that any measurable driving force will exceed it. Alternatively, for sharp interfaces, the critical driving force will be very large, and most growth will occur by the lateral step mechanism.|$|E

In a wedge-shaped homeotropic cell, the edge and <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations</b> interaction gives rise to a strong-enough optical contrast and makes visible their mutual intersections at temperatures close to the smectic-A to smectic-C phase transition temperature. The nature of the defects is confirmed by confocal microscopy observations. At large scale we observe a forest of <b>screw</b> <b>dislocations,</b> perpendicular to the smectic layers, across the thickness of the cell (end-on configuration). Their density varies between 109 and 1012 m− 2.
