60|$|<b>She</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> hand, {{and then}} the Squire {{offering}} him his arm, he went down the steps to his carriage.|$|E
5000|$|Jackson Rathbone as Trent - {{a boy who}} {{witnesses}} {{his house}} being robbed, refuses {{to tell the truth}} to the police. Daphne discovers new elements to her powers when <b>she</b> <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> hand and can read his past thoughts/memories re: the break-in.|$|R
50|$|Giovanni {{enters the}} garden alone and finds Beatriz, who is startled. She reveals {{that she had}} been waiting for him. Sharing their {{emotions}} in duet, Giovanni goes to touch a tree in the garden. Beatrice stops him, telling him that the tree is dangerous. <b>She</b> <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> hand in the process. Dr. Rappaccini arrives and Beatriz runs away. The doctor tells Giovanni that he wishes to be friends. Giovanni departs.|$|R
50|$|Anna {{returns to}} her husband and their home, where Sarah soon visits and tells Anna that she must leave her husband as she now knows where she belongs. After giving Daniel one last night together, Anna rides off to the Lakota camp only to find it destroyed. She then sees Tokalah still on the land, mourning. He assumes she is another vision, but <b>she</b> <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> face and confesses her love for him and they embrace.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> cold {{lips with}} remorseful tenderness, {{and in the}} same breath {{registered}} a vow to obey that dying prayer.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> {{outstretched hand}} with her fingers, and then fearing lest he should change his mind, {{promptly}} rang the bell.|$|E
6000|$|His look, {{more than}} his tone, cut Lucy; and involuntarily <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> arm. [...] "Oh, you won't refuse to take them! Please don't!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After all," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> arm, [...] "this {{young man}} will {{scarcely}} run away. Please remember that I {{am not an}} athletic person--and I have not much breath left." ...|$|R
60|$|Lady Ruth {{had played}} her trump card. <b>She</b> had <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> fingers with hers, her eyes shone {{with the promise}} of unutterable things. But if Wingrave was moved, he did not show it.|$|R
50|$|Dave's bizarre {{behavior}} continues much to Edie's discomfort. During the night, Edie finds {{he is out}} of bed {{and goes}} down to the kitchen to find him talking to himself, but is unaware he is seeing Lila and Paige again. <b>She</b> <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> shoulder and he turns around quickly and smacks her arm accidentally. The next morning, she demands an explanation. He explains he has had his previous wife on his mind, but she was not aware he was previously married. She gives him {{the rest of the day}} to pack his bags, and she throws him out of the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, adieu! Simon," [...] and, with an {{agitated}} heart, though apparent calmness, <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> {{forehead with}} her lips. [...] "I expect an unsatisfactory dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will come}} and dine with me soon, won't you, Mr. Maddison?" [...] Lady Thurwell asked him, as <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> hand {{stepping}} into the brougham.|$|E
60|$|Following him, <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> arm, and {{presented}} her request. He {{shook his head}} in token of refusal. She came back to her place by me.|$|E
6000|$|... "A little more--a little more," [...] said <b>she,</b> petulantly <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> {{hand with}} the forefinger, to make him incline the cup more generously and yieldingly. [...] "It smells of spice and sugar, but I can't taste it; your wrist is so stiff, and you are so stingy." ...|$|R
60|$|Julian {{rose from}} the place that he had occupied. Horace neither moved nor spoke. His head was on his breast: the traces of tears on his cheeks owned mutely that <b>she</b> had <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> heart. Would he forgive her? Julian passed on, and {{approached}} Mercy's chair.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> was <b>touched</b> at <b>his</b> {{being so}} spiritless as {{not even to}} say that she ought to have been thrown in after it.|$|R
6000|$|Kind as {{a mother}} herself, <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> cheeks with her hands: [...] "Blessed is she who has borne thee, {{although}} she should weep as she [...] stands." ...|$|E
60|$|Swaying {{there like}} a furred Valkyrie above the final carnage of men and gods, <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> imagination, and the blood surged exultingly along unknown channels, thrilling and uplifting.|$|E
60|$|And he {{returned}} to his boot-cleaning, singing softly. <b>She</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> thick hair, and he kissed her fingers. He worked away at her shoes. At last they were quite presentable.|$|E
6000|$|His arms {{crept up}} till he had buried his face against her waist. Without quite knowing what <b>she</b> did, Gyp <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> hair, and said again: ...|$|R
60|$|Quite by {{accident}} {{he touched her}} hand on the table, and <b>she</b> answered <b>his</b> <b>touch.</b>|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> {{laughed and}} <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> arms, showing {{him that they}} were still {{clasping}} that beautiful suit of clothes to his breast--the very clothes of his wonderful dream! ...|$|R
6000|$|His arm slid {{behind her}} shoulders. The insinuating music drained her independence. She said mournfully, [...] "Would {{you take care}} of me?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> hand. It was warm, solid.|$|E
6000|$|At {{this point}} in the story, <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> arm, and, with a face {{perfectly}} white with interest, said, [...] "Do you know the names of the people he bought her of?" ...|$|E
60|$|Hilary, who {{was also}} shivering, hastened to Bianca's room. She was just coming down, and exclaimed at seeing him all wet. When {{he had told her}} of the episode <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good-bye, Princess. If we don't meet again, {{remember}} your old friend Dan sometimes,' <b>she,</b> <b>touched</b> by <b>his</b> late danger and the wistful look he wore, answered with unusual warmth: 'How can I help it, {{when you make}} us all so proud of you? God bless your mission, and bring you safely home to us again!' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Butterflies" [...] again sails {{close to}} the wind of obscenity, being told {{through the eyes of}} a {{socially}} isolated man who is not remarkable in any positive way. On one of his walks into his town's decaying underbelly, he meets a young girl and walks with her. On arrival at a deserted dry canal, he demands that <b>she</b> <b>touch</b> <b>his</b> penis, and after this sordid encounter, drowns her. Perhaps most harrowing is the way the protagonist describes the murder, [...] "My mind was clear, my body was relaxed and I was thinking of nothing... I ... eased her quietly into the canal." [...] Again morality is completely detached and the reader is made to squirm at the lack of remorse or even feeling shown.|$|R
60|$|Still, it {{was evident}} that Tony was in trouble, and as he did not go {{shooting}} with the rest she found him idling in an empty room when dusk was closing down. He was standing by the hearth looking down into the flickering flame; but the fashion in which he started when <b>she</b> gently <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> shoulder was significant.|$|R
60|$|He {{could not}} tell her that he longed {{for the right to}} shelter her always--it was not very long since the Canadian tragedy--but silence cost him an effort. At length <b>she</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> arm.|$|E
60|$|They retraced their steps. Once {{more they}} drew {{near to the}} Embassy. The night had grown warmer and more windows had been opened. They reached the verandah. <b>She</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> hand for a moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh well," [...] said Olivia: [...] "you are obstinate and I {{suppose you}} must go. Perhaps I'm superstitious, but {{sometimes}} the third venture is unlucky." [...] <b>She</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> arm. [...] "I don't want you to run a risk!" ...|$|E
50|$|Montoya convincingly {{explains}} to the assembled partygoers his belief {{a woman is}} hurt and the new doctor will examine each one. Helm reluctantly agrees and the amused women readily line up so the doctor can give each one a cursory examination. Tessa joins the queue seeing no way out and as {{she is about to}} be examined Marta breaks a glass in her hand and comes forward. Dr Helm takes Marta to his office much the annoyance of Montoya who insists on a dance with Tessa before she follows Marta. As Dr Helm treats Marta's wound <b>she</b> <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> hand and her gypsy persona senses that the doctor was not always a doctor but a soldier in the Napoleonic wars with blood on his hands and secrets to hide.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I must {{part from}} thee and thy sturdy pony. Thanks {{for the use}} of it,' added she, as the squire {{proceeded}} to take her from the pony. He would have lifted her down, but <b>she</b> only <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> hand lightly and sprang to the ground, then stood patting its neck. 'Thanks again, good pony. I am much beholden to thee, Gaffer Hob! Stay a moment.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It also accounts," [...] Beatrice replied, with {{a little}} break of the lips, [...] "for my anxiety that she should not find me. Leonard," [...] <b>she</b> added, <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> hand for a moment with hers, [...] "I wish that I could tell you everything, but there are things behind, things so terrible, that even to you, my dear brother, I could not speak of them." ...|$|R
