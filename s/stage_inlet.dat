40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the time-averaged and the time-resolved flow in a two-stage two-spool test rig {{located at the}} Institute for Thermal Turbomachinery and Machine Dynamics (ITTM) of Graz University of Technology. The facility consists of a transonic turbine stage followed by a counter-rotating subsonic low pressure turbine. The rig was designed and operated within the EU-project DREAM, where the target was to built up a machine able to investigate the aerodynamics of interturbine S-shaped channels. An optimized design of this component represents a critical goal for the performances of modern and future jet engines. The turbine design techniques are nowadays still carried out by optimizations based on steadystate simulations: nevertheless since a long time {{it is well known}} how the engine performances are strongly dependent by the unsteady effects. The use of interfaces such as mixing plane or frozen rotor cuts off the real interactions between successive blade rows so that pressure losses and aeroacoustic effects are consequently estimated incorrectly. Such considerations are important for the designer who has to face a highly three dimensional unsteady flow like in a transonic turbine stage. Therefore, the aim of the present paper is to provide a quantitative comparison in terms of performance estimation error whenever a numerical simulation is undertaken in order to catch the time-mean or the time-resolved flow.

40|$|Two-dimensional {{numerical}} simulations {{are conducted}} for a single-stage axial-turbine {{system with the}} inlet gas flow provided by a pulse detonation combustor. The objectives {{of this study are}} to compute the turbine work output as a function of rotor speed and gain insights into the significant gap between theoretical predictions and experimental results. The turbine work output is evaluated by two approaches. One is an energy balance evaluation method using average stagnation enthalpy at the <b>stage</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet, and the other is a mechanical method of integrating the force acting on the rotor blade surface. From the results of both approaches, it is confirmed that the turbine work increases with increasing rotor speed up to 150 % from the design point.

40|$|Airspeed and {{turbulence}} {{measurements were}} collected in a full-scale swine grower facility. Data {{were collected in}} three horizontal planes at eight axial locations from the inlet sidewall. Three inlet slot heights (20, 40, and 60 mm) and two fan stages resulted in six ventilating conditions investigated. The resulting 2 ¥ 3 ¥ 8 factorial experiment showed that fan <b>stage,</b> <b>inlet</b> height, and axial position from the inlet significantly affected (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) airspeed variations in the animal-occupied zone (AOZ). Correlations between the AOZ and a convenient measuring plane (MP) were sought. AOZ airspeed was highly correlated with MP airspeed (rxy = 0. 91). AOZ turbulent intensity (rxy = – 0. 51) and turbulent kinetic energy (rxy = 0. 75) were moderately correlated with MP airspeed.

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} an aspirated fan stage designed {{to achieve a}} pressure ratio of 3. 4 : 1 at 1500 ft/sec is presented in this paper. The low-energy viscous flow is aspirated from diffusion-limiting locations on the blades and flowpath surfaces of the stage, enabling a very high pressure ratio to be achieved in a single stage. The fan stage performance was mapped at various operating speeds from choke to stall in a compressor facility at fully simulated engine conditions. The experimentally determined stage performance, in terms of pressure ratio and corresponding inlet mass flow rate, {{was found to be}} in good agreement with the three-dimensional viscous computational prediction, and in turn close to the design intent. Stage pressure ratios exceeding 3 : 1 were achieved at design speed, with an aspiration flow fraction of 3. 5 percent of the <b>stage</b> <b>inlet</b> mass flow. The experimental performance of the stage at various operating conditions, including detailed flowfield measurements, are presented and discussed {{in the context of the}} computational analyses.

40|$|An {{intermediate}} turbine duct {{guides the}} {{flow from the}} smaller diameter high pressure turbine to the downstream larger diameter intermediate or low pressure turbine. It is typically equipped with a structural vane transferring loads for the core to the external parts, and supplies the core with necessary services such as oil and air. Flow in an intermediate turbine duct is highly complex, influenced by the upstream turbine stage flow structures, which include tip leakage flows and non-uniformities originating from the upstream high pressure turbine vane and rotor. The complexity of the flow structures makes predicting them using numerical methods difficult, hence there exists a need for experimental validation. This thesis includes results from experiments conducted in two different facilities, the Chalmers Large-Scale Low-Speed Turbine Facility and the Oxford Turbine Research Facility. At Chalmers, the emphasis was at aerodynamic measurements including static pressure, total pressure, velocities and flow angles in the intermediate turbine duct. In Oxford, the experimental campaign included both aerodynamic and heat transfer measurements {{with the purpose of}} describing the aerothermal flow through the intermediate turbine duct. A new intermediate turbine duct with a medium turning vane was designed, manufactured, instrumented and installed in the Oxford Turbine Research Facility. Three high pressure turbine <b>stage</b> <b>inlet</b> conditions were studied; a uniform inlet flow and two low-NOx swirl profiles. Three adjacent intermediate turbine duct vanes were instrumented in an identical manner, to study the vane-to-vane clocking effect. Instrumentation includes static pressure tappings and thin film heat flux gauges installed on the intermediate turbine duct vane and endwalls at discrete locations. A three-hole pressure probe equipped with thermocouples above and below was traversed at the intermediate turbine duct exit. Steady and unsteady CFD predictions were performed of the intermediate turbine duct on its own and the full 1. 5 high pressure turbine stage. The results from the test campaign in Oxford show the clocking effect to have a larger effect on the surface aerodynamics and heat transfer of the intermediate turbine duct vane than the introduction of a low-NOx swirl profile at the high pressure turbine <b>stage</b> <b>inlet.</b> The clocking effect is for example seen to change the incidence to the intermediate turbine duct vane. The change in inlet condition is seen to have local effects in the intermediate turbine duct. The CFD results are found to in general match the experimental data fairly well, both in aerodynamics and heat transfer. A comparison of steady and averaged time averaged unsteady CFD is noted to provide similar results...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a 16 -stage axial-flow compressor, in which two modifications of unloaded <b>inlet</b> <b>stages</b> were combined with loaded exit stages, has been determined. In the first modification the exit stages were loaded by decreasing the twelfth through fifteenth stage stator angles 3 deg. {{as compared with the}} blade angles in the original compressor, and the <b>inlet</b> <b>stages</b> were unloaded by increasing the blade angles the following amounts: guide vanes and first-stage stator, 6 deg; second- and third-stage stators, 4 deg.; and fourth-stage stators, 3 deg. The over-all {{performance of}} this configuration was compared with that of the compressor with the original blade angles. The peak efficiency was increased at all speeds below design and the weight flow was higher at speeds below 80 percent of design, the same at 80 percent of design, and lower at speeds abovce 80 percent of design. The maximum reduction in weight flow occurred at design speed. The surge limit line was higher at speeds between 75 and 90 percent of design when presented on a pressure ratio against weight flow basis. The second configuration was the same as the first with the exception that the second-, third-, and fourth-stage stator blade angles were the same as in the compressor with the original blade angles. A comparison of the performance of this configuration with that of the compressor with the original blade angles showed the same general trends of changes in performance as the first configuration. Comparisons were made of compressor configurations to show the effects upon the performance of decreased loading in the <b>inlet</b> <b>stages.</b> Below 75 percent of design speed, decreased loading results in increased weight flow and peak efficiency; above 80 percent of design speed, decreased loading in the <b>inlet</b> <b>stages</b> results in decreased weight flow and small changes in peak efficiencies. Between 75 and 90 percent of design the changes in surge weight flow and pressure ratio were such that the surge limit line was raised with decreased loading in the <b>inlet</b> <b>stages</b> when presented as pressure ratio against weight flow...|$|R

40|$|The {{preliminary}} design of multistage axial compressors in gas turbine engines is typically accomplished with mean-line methods. These methods, which rely on empirical correlations, estimate compressor performance well near the design point, but may become less reliable off-design. For land-based applications of gas turbine engines, off-design performance estimates {{are becoming increasingly}} important, as turbine plant operators desire peaking or load-following capabilities and hot-day operability. The current work develops a one-dimensional stage stacking procedure, including a newly defined blockage term, {{which is used to}} estimate the off-design performance and operability range of a 13 -stage axial compressor used in a power generating gas turbine engine. The new blockage term is defined to give mathematical closure on static pressure, and values of blockage are shown to collapse to curves as a function of <b>stage</b> <b>inlet</b> flow coefficient and corrected shaft speed. In addition to these blockage curves, the stage stacking procedure utilizes stage characteristics of ideal work coefficient and adiabatic efficiency. These curves are constructed using flow information extracted from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of groups of stages within the compressor. Performance estimates resulting from the stage stacking procedure are shown to match the results of CFD simulations of the entire compressor to within 1. 6 % in overall total pressure ratio and within 0. 3 points in overall adiabatic efficiency. Utility of the stage stacking procedure is demonstrated by estimation of the minimum corrected speed which allows stable operation of the compressor. Further utility of the stage stacking procedure is demonstrated with a bleed sensitivity study, which estimates a bleed schedule to expand the compressors operating range...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} axial turbine <b>stage</b> <b>inlet</b> non-uniformities are {{examined}} through two model problems: wake attenuation and hot streak processing. In the first, twodimensional calculations (RANS and URANS) {{are used to}} identify the mechanisms contributing to upstream stator wake attenuation through a turbine blade row. For a representative turbine rotor, pitch and time-averaged wake attenuation by 74 % percent is demonstrated at one quarter chord downstream of the trailing edge. Near the pressure surface, the wake stagnation pressure increases by up to 42 % above the freestream stagnation pressure. The mechanisms identified are a localized reduction in flow-through time for wake fluid near the pressure surface, compared to the freestream, and an unsteady pressure field (Op/&t) in the rotor reference frame that increases work extraction in the freestream relative to wake fluid. For the second model problem, three-dimensional calculations (RANS and URANS) identify a difference in turbine efficiency sensitivity to thermal distortion between a geometry with no tip gap and a geometry with a finite tip gap. The turbine with a tip clearance is 2. 5 times less sensitive, in terms of efficiency decrease, to an inlet hot streak. For the tip gap and no tip gap geometries, the efficiency drops by 0. 75 % and 1. 86 % respectively for a peak temperature non-uniformity equal to 0. 6 times the combustor temperature rise. The difference in efficiency decrease, due to hot streak, between the two geometries is linked {{to a reduction in}} tip leakage mixing losses caused by changes in relative rotor inlet flow angle with and without hot streak. by Devon Jedamski.

40|$|Pronounced non-uniformities in {{combustor}} exit {{flow temperature}} (hot-streaks), which arise because of discrete {{injection of fuel}} and dilution air jets within the combustor and because of end-wall cooling flows, affect both component life and aerodynamics. Because {{it is very difficult}} to quantitatively predict the affects of these temperature non-uniformities on the heat transfer rates, designers are forced to budget for hot-streaks in the cooling system design process. Consequently, components are designed for higher working temperatures than the mass-mean gas temperature, and this imposes a significant overall performance penalty. An inadequate cooling budget can lead to reduced component life. An improved understanding of hot-streak migration physics, or robust correlations based on reliable experimental data, would help designers minimise the overhead on cooling flow that is currently a necessity. A number of recent research projects sponsored by a range of industrial gas turbine and aero-engine manufacturers attest to the growing interest in hot-streak physics. This paper presents measurements of surface and end-wall heat transfer rate for an HP nozzle guide vane (NGV) operating as part of a full HP turbine stage in an annular transonic rotating turbine facility. Measurements were conducted with both uniform <b>stage</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature and with two non-uniform temperature profiles. The temperature profiles were non-dimensionally similar to profiles measured in an engine. A difference of one half of an NGV pitch in the circumferential (clocking) position of the hot-streak with respect to the NGV was used to investigate the affect of clocking on the vane surface and end-wall heat transfer rate. The vane surface pressure distributions, and the results of a flow-visualisation study, which are also given, are used to aid interpretation of the results. The results are compared to two-dimensional predictions conducted using two different boundary layer methods. Experiments were conducted in the Isentropic Light Piston Facility (ILPF) at QinetiQ Farnborough, a short duration engine-size turbine facility. Mach number, Reynolds number and gas-to-wall temperature ratios were correctly modelled. It is believed that the heat transfer measurements presented in this paper are the first of their kind.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} an altitude test chamber {{to determine the effects}} of inlet airflow distortion on the compressor steady-state and surge characteristics of a high-pressure ratio, axial-flow turbojet engine. Circumferential-type inlet flow distortions were investigated, which covered a range of distortion sector angles from 20 deg to 168 deg and distortion levels up to 22 percent. The presence of inlet airflow distortions at the compressor face resulted in a substantial increase in the local pressure ratio in the distorted region, primarily for the <b>inlet</b> <b>stages.</b> The local pressure ratio in the distorted region for the <b>inlet</b> <b>stages</b> increased as either the distortion sector angle decreased or the percent distortion increased. The average compressor-surge pressure ratio was much more sensitive to inlet airflow distortions at lower engine speeds than at engine speeds near rated. Hence, compressor-surge margin reduction due to inlet airflow distortion was quite severe at the lower engine speeds. Although the average compressor-surge pressure ratio was generally reduced with inlet flow distortion, local pressure ratios across the distorted sector of the compressor were obtained during surge and were significantly greater than the normal compressor-surge pressure ratio. This was a result of increased loading of the <b>inlet</b> <b>stages</b> in the distorted region...|$|R

40|$|This work {{concerns}} the validation of two 1 D Turbine Design Tools, AXIAL by Concepts NREC and TML by GKN Aerospace, and is purely computational. By using the KTH Test Turbine {{as a reference}} frame, these two software programs were set up to simulate its performance, and the results consequently validated against existing experimental data from the turbine. The main objective of this work is to investigate the performance prediction abilities of the 1 D Design Tools {{for a variety of}} turbine parameters such as efficiency, mass flow, power output and degree of reaction, and study the accuracy of these predictions under given boundary conditions, namely turbine <b>stage</b> <b>inlet</b> pressure, temperature and pressure ratio. The main focus of the simulation was to evaluate the impact of the choice of loss model in the 1 D Software Tools for estimation of losses. Thus, in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of differences and similarities among the scope of available loss models, as well as deviation models, a literature study was performed. Additionally, in order to extend the knowledge of the detailed performance prediction characteristics of these software tools in regard to the loss model implemented, the individual loss coefficients (profile, secondary, trailing edge, tip clearance and incidence) were studied and analysed. The impact of chosen pressure ratio on the 1 D simulation accuracy was also investigated. The software tool used and the loss model selected were both found to be of great significance to the accuracy of the simulated performance. The pressure ratio (PR) used for simulation also proved to be of great significance, with simulations performed at an elevated PR providing considerably more accurate results than at the design PR, suggesting that the majority of loss models are more accurate when estimating with higher PR. The KTH Test Turbine stage validated in this work featured a number of special geometrical features of inconvenient nature for 1 D simulations. In order to account for this, a number of correction coefficients were developed and implemented and their individual effect on the simulated performance studied. Another special feature of the turbine stage studied was the lean angle of the stator, which impact on the 1 D simulations was also investigated. Additionally, a number of different user selectable parameters in AXIAL and their impact on the simulations were investigated. The geometry correction coefficients and stator lean angle were found to be of negligible impact to the overall estimated performance, while the user selectable parameters in AXIAL proved to be of relatively big influence on the simulated results. Lastly, using the TML software tool, the concept of stator-rotor disc cavity flow known as 'purge flow' was simulated and validated against reference data. Purge flow serves to inhibit the inflow of hot air from the main annulus to the inner hub and simultaneously cool the rotor blades. The TML software was found to overestimate the losses associated with the use of purge flow, although providing relatively coherent trends for parameters such as efficiency, mass flow and power, suggesting that a correction coefficient applied to the overall losses from purge flow could potentially provide better overall accuracy in the simulations.

40|$|The Sampling Procedures and Venues Workgroup {{discussed}} the potential venues available and {{issues associated with}} obtaining measurements. Some of the issues included Incoming Air Quality, Sampling Locations, Probes and Sample Systems. The following is {{a summary of the}} discussion of the issues and venues. The influence of inlet air to the measurement of exhaust species, especially trace chemical species, must be considered. Analysis procedures for current engine exhaust emissions regulatory measurements require adjustments for air inlet humidity. As a matter of course in scientific investigations, it is recommended that "background" measurements for any species, particulate or chemical, be performed during inlet air flow before initiation of combustion, if possible, and during the engine test period as feasible and practical. For current regulatory measurements, this would be equivalent to setting the "zero" level for conventional gas analyzers. As a minimum, it is recommended that measurements of the humidity and particulates in the incoming air be taken at the start and end of each test run. Additional measurement points taken during the run are desirable if they can be practically obtained. It was felt that the presence of trace gases in the incoming air is not a significant problem. However, investigators should consider the ambient levels and influences of local air pollution for species of interest. Desired measurement locations depend upon the investigation requirements. A complete investigation of phenomenology of particulate formation and growth requires measurements at a number of locations both within the engine and in the exhaust field downstream of the nozzle exit plane. Desirable locations for both extractive and in situ measurements include: (1) Combustion Zone (Multiple axial locations); (2) Combustor Exit (Multiple radial locations for annular combustors); (3) Turbine <b>Stage</b> (<b>Inlet</b> and exit of the stage); (4) Exit Nozzle (Multiple axial locations downstream of the nozzle). Actual locations with potential for extractive or non-intrusive measurements depend upon the test article and test configuration. Committee members expressed the importance of making investigators aware of various ports that could allow access to various stages of the existing engines. Port locations are engine si) ecific and might allow extractive sampling or innovative hybrid optical-probe access. The turbine stage region was one the most desirable locations for obtaining samples and might be accessed through boroscope ports available in some engine designs. Discussions of probes and sampling systems quickly identified issues dependent on particular measurement quantities. With general consensus, the group recommends SAE procedures for measurements and data analyses of currently regulated exhaust species (CO 2, CO, THC, NO(x),) using conventional gas sampling techniques. Special procedures following sound scientific practices must be developed as required for species and/or measurement conditions not covered by SAE standards. Several issues arose concerning short lived radicals and highly reactive species. For conventional sampling, there are concerns of perturbing the sample during extraction, line losses, line-wall reactions, and chemical reactions during the sample transport to the analyzers. Sample lines coated with quartz. or other materials should be investigated for minimization of such effects. The group advocates the development of innovative probe techniques and non-intrusive optical techniques for measurement of short lived radicals and highly reactive species that cannot be sampled accurately otherwise. Two innovative probe concepts were discussed. One concept uses specially designed probes to transfer optical beams to and from a region of flow inaccessible by traditional ports or windows. The probe can perturb the flow field but must have a negligible impact on the region to be optically sampled. Such probes are referred to as hybrid probes and are under development at AEDC for measurement in the high pressure, high temperature of a combustor under development for power generation. The other concept consists of coupling an instrument directly to the probe. The probe would isolate a representative sample stream, freeze chemical reactions and direct the sample into the analyzer portion of the probe. Thus, the measurement would be performed in situ without sample line losses due either to reactions or binding at the wall surfaces. This concept was used to develop a fast, in situ, time-of-flight mass spectrometer measurement system for temporal quantification of NO in the IMPULSE facility at AEDC. Additional work is required in this area to determine the best probe and sampling technique for each species measurement requirement identified by the Trace Chemistry Working Group. A partial list of Venues was used as a baseline for discussion. Additional venues were added to the list and the list was broken out into the following categories: (1) Engines (a) Sea Level Test Stands (b) Altitude Chambers; (2) Annular Combustor Test Stands, (3) Sector Flametube Test Stands, (4) Fundamentals Rigs/Experiments...|$|E

The primary inputs to the program are the number of <b>stages,</b> the <b>inlet</b> total pressure and temperature, the static pressure downstream of each nozzle and rotor row, the absolute fluid velocity angle at the nozzle exit for each stage, and the relative fluid velocity angle at the rotor blade discharge for each stage. The program uses the empirical Soderberg loss correlation to determine the total-to-total and total-to-static turbine efficiencies, and the Zweifel criterion for determining nozzle and rotor solidity...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the evaluation of}} multi-stage adsorption dryers with air dehumidification by zeolite and alumina pillared clay. In a multi-stage dryer product is dried {{in a number of}} succeeding stages and for each stage the air is dehumidified by the adsorbent. The exhaust air from each stage is reused for product drying in a following stage after passing a bed with adsorbent. The heat efficiency of the drying system is evaluated and compared with a conventional drying system using air dehumidified by condensation. The evaluation concerns the effect of <b>stage</b> number, <b>inlet</b> dryer temperatures 10 - 50 °C and inlet ambient air 10 - 25 °C. Results show that the performance of the multi-stage adsorption dryers increases with the number of stages and a three stage system is economically most promising. For varying ambient air conditions, zeolite as adsorbent is the most favourable...|$|R
40|$|The {{bifurcated}} inlet {{examined in}} this study (which is one of several being considered in the High Speed Research (HSR) Program) was chosen based upon paper trade studies of axisymmetric, single sided, and bifurcated inlets. For a given compression ratio and mass flow a bifurcated inlet weighs less than a single sided inlet. An axisymmetric inlet has less bleed requirements than 2 D inlets but has trouble matching transonic airflow requirements without going to a variable diameter centerbody. The bifurcated inlet was selected as one of the candidates because of its ability to match airflow schedules. The inlet {{examined in this}} study, the Two <b>Stage</b> Supersonic <b>Inlet</b> (TSSI), was a candidate mixed compression bifurcated inlet. It has a novel concept to aid in inlet stability. This concept was tested in the 10 x 10 wind tunnel at NASA Glenn. CFD tools were used to predict and interpret the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedModifications {{were made to}} the Naval Postgraduate School cold-flow turbine test rig to enable integration of a two-component laser-doppler velocimetry (LDV) system. The test turbine was the Space-Shuttle Main Engine, High-Pressure Fuel Turbopump, Alternate-Turbopump Development Model, manufactured by Pratt & Whitney. Flow field measurements were obtained, using a the LDV system, in the first-stage rotor end-wall region of the test turbine, at three axial locations and at three depths from the end wall. For each survey location, velocity ratios, absolute flow angle, turbulence intensities, and correlation coefficients were examined. The laser data exhibited distinct trends with axial position, depth from the end wall, and with circumferential position. In addition to the laser data, velocity profiles were determined at the first- <b>stage</b> stator <b>inlet</b> and rotor exit planes, using a three-hole pressure probe. Both laser and probe data were taken at referred rotational speeds in the range 4815 to 4853 rpm. Phase-locked measurements were recorded using a once-per- revolution signal from a magnetic pick-up as a trigger.

40|$|The {{pressure}} wave generator {{is a critical}} component of a pulse tube refrigerator. Conventionally either a solenoid operated electromagnetic valve or a rotary valve driven by a hermetically sealed motor is used for this. In this article, we present a novel {{pressure wave}} generator design based on cam operated valves for use with pulse tube refrigerators. This, when coupled with an inverter drive (variable frequency drive), forms a versatile pressure wave generator in the range between 1 and 10 Hz. In a single <b>stage</b> double <b>inlet</b> pulse tube using this type of pressure wave generator, refrigeration power of about 6 W at 77 K and a no load temperature of about 42 K were obtained. The above results are comparable to those obtained with pulse tube systems based on other two types of pressure wave generators. While the rotary valve based pressure wave generator is prone to developing leaks at the rotating seal, the solenoid valve based system cannot be operated continuously due to coil failure. The cam operated valve based pressure wave generator overcomes the above shortfalls of rotary valve and solenoid valve type pressure generators and is well suited for continuous operation of the refrigerator...|$|R
