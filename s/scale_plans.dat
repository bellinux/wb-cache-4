5|$|The state {{suffered}} from financial difficulties {{during its first}} three decades. Jonathan Jennings attempted to begin a period of internal improvements. Among his projects, the Indiana Canal Company was reestablished to build a canal around the Falls of the Ohio. The Panic of 1819 caused the state's only two banks to fold. This hurt Indiana's credit, halted the projects, and hampered the start of new projects until the 1830s, after the repair of the state's finances during the terms of William Hendricks and Noah Noble. Beginning in 1831, large <b>scale</b> <b>plans</b> for statewide improvements were set into motion. Overspending on the internal improvements led to a large deficit {{that had to be}} funded by state bonds through the newly created Bank of Indiana and sale of over nine million acres (36,000km²) of public land. By 1841 the debt had become unmanageable. Having borrowed over $13million, the equivalent to the state's first fifteen years of tax revenue, the government could not even pay interest on the debt. The state narrowly avoided bankruptcy by negotiating the liquidation of the public works, transferring them to the state's creditors in exchange for a 50% reduction in the state's debt. The internal improvements began under Jennings paid off as the state began to experience rapid population growth that slowly remedied the state's funding problems. The improvements led to a fourfold increase in land value, and an even larger increase in farm produce.|$|E

5000|$|November 2007: The airport {{published}} {{a master plan}} for its development up to 2030, called [...] "Towards 2030: Planning a Sustainable Future for Air Transport in the Midlands". This sets out details of changes to the terminals, airfield layout and off-site infrastructure. As with all large <b>scale</b> <b>plans,</b> the proposals are controversial, with opposition from environmentalists and local residents. In particular the requirement for a second parallel runway based on projected demand was disputed by opponents. Plans for a 2nd runway {{on the other side}} of the M42 and a new terminal building and business park have been published, and they could help to create around 250,000 jobs. It has been estimated that if these plans went ahead, the airport could handle around 70,000,000 passengers annually, and around 500,000 aircraft movements.|$|E

50|$|Changes to {{the park}} layout that {{occurred}} during the period from 1930-2003 can be traced though comparison of park plans. Unfortunately, as was done for Batman and Penders Parks, no large <b>scale</b> <b>plans</b> appear to have been drawn up for Johnson Park to show proposed or existing conditions before works were undertaken. It therefore seems that the changes which occurred in the Park during this period were part of an incremental simplifying of the park rather than {{as a result of a}} major landscape upgrade as occurred with the other two parks. During these times, additional items were added to the Park including a picnic rotunda, barbecues, tables, seats and additional playground equipment. Additional tree planting also occurred but this did not substantially alter what was presumed to be the original park layout. Far more substantial over this period was the loss of the eastern boundary and central feature paths and their associated avenue planting.|$|E
50|$|During his {{lifetime}} Willson {{built up a}} very notable collection of Lincolnshire antiquities and items collected with Lincolnshire History. Shortly {{after his death in}} 1854, a printed Catalogue of the extensive and valuable collection of books, prints, paintings, ancient and medieval remains, antique porcelain, household furniture and other effects of the late Edward James Willson was prepared. It is assumed that many of his possessions were disposed of at this time and the bulk of his notable collection of archaeological finds were acquired by the Duke of Northumberland and are now on display in the Museum at Alnwick Castle. It may also be at this time that the Lincoln Cathedral Library obtained three folio volumes of monochrome drawings.A. City and County. Churches, Ruins, Fragments, Miscellaneous Antiquities. B. Views of Ancient Buildings in Lincoln by R. Cattermole, A. Pugin, F. J.

However, there was a further sale of his manuscripts and drawings at Sotheby's in 1888 The greater part of these papers, contained in 31 volumes or albums and 3 portfolios, were acquired by the Society of Antiquaries of London, and microfilm copies of these are also available at the Lincolnshire Record Office.|$|E

5000|$|Castle Oliver a.k.a. Clonodfoy/Clonghanodfoy Castle, Co.Limerick, Ireland (1845-52) Scottish Baronial; also {{commissioned}} by the Oliver Gascoigne sisters, it is a 110-room private residence with 2 matching gate lodges built of pink sandstone quarried locally. It featured Minton encaustic tiles and stained glass, as well as decorative ceilings, all designed by the sisters. The stonework was built by Thos. H Carroll of Dublin; Messrs. Henry & Thos. Creaser, of York, were the contractors for the interior finishings; Johnston Silley & Co, Decorator, Dublin, executed the decorative paintwork (still being completed in 1857) & Mr John Walker, of Walker Iron Foundry, York, supplied all the ironwork of the roof, etc. [...] Monograms of Carroll and Creaser, the 2 main contractors, feature in a decorative terracotta panel set high in the gable overlooking the courtyard. See examples of this and other features: http://www.castle-oliver.com/Pages/Pics/Original-features.html Jones designed large stone gryphons, 11 of which sat on the balustrade surrounding the castle. These were probably carved from Portland Stone and disintegrated in the wet Irish climate in the early 20th century. Facsimiles have recently been created from photographic evidence and a limited edition made available http://www.triton.uk.com/index.php/showcase/commission-for-castle-oliver-in-ireland/. Small <b>scale</b> <b>plans</b> signed by Jones and dated 24 June 1845 are in the Manuscripts Room at Dublin Library. The castle is remarkable for its simple, but immensely effective and durable cast & wrought iron roof trusses, which were made in numbered component form in York and assembled on site. These trusses {{are believed to have}} been relatively 'cutting edge' at the time, although it appears that Walker Iron Foundry made similar ones in 1843 to restore the Nave roof of York Minster.

Within a context of austerity following the abolition of regional policy machinery, and an onerous national target framework, localities are entering a new phase of incentivised development.
