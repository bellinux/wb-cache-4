50|$|The car {{was quite}} spacious {{due to its}} <b>semi-monocoque</b> <b>design</b> which was quite an {{advancement}} in early 50's in vehicle engineering. The car was designed by Alec Issigonis whose other famous designs were Mini and Morris Minor.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{most other}} Rans models, which feature a welded 4130 steel tube cockpit with a bolted {{aluminum}} tube rear fuselage, the S-19 is an aluminum <b>semi-monocoque</b> <b>design,</b> with stressed skin construction supported with bulkheads, formers and stringers. The fuselage, wing and tail surfaces {{are covered in}} sheet aluminum. The wings are equipped with flaps.|$|E
25|$|The Whitley {{holds the}} {{distinction}} of having been the first aircraft to serve with the RAF to utilise a semi-monocoque fuselage, which was built using a slab-sided structure to ease production. This replaced the traditional tubular construction method previously employed by Armstrong Whitworth, instead constructing the airframe from light-alloy rolled sections, pressings, and corrugated sheets. According to aviation author Philip Moyes, the decision to adopt the <b>semi-monocoque</b> fuselage <b>design</b> was a significant step forwards, {{and the integrity of}} which was well-proven during subsequent RAF service, having survived multiple instances of severe damage being sustained.|$|R
50|$|Instead of {{licensing}} another design, Pfalz instead licensed {{the previously}} patented Roland firm's Wickelrumpf (wrapped-fuselage) plywood strip-covered <b>semi-monocoque</b> fuselage <b>design</b> and combined {{it with the}} new 160 hp Mercedes D.III engine to create the Pfalz D.III. The D.III entered service in August 1917, but was not considered a match for contemporary designs like the Albatros D.V, and instead found a niche role in attacking observation balloons where its high diving speed was a major advantage. About 600 D.IIIs and slightly modified D.IIIas were built between its introduction in August and its replacement a year later. Many were still in service at that time, about 450.|$|R
5000|$|The LP-49 is an {{improved}} {{version of the}} LP-46, designed for the Standard Class with a 49.2 ft wingspan. The LP-49 has a metal wing with a NACA 64(3)-618 laminar flow airfoil and all-metal tail surfaces. The control surfaces are all counter-weighted with internal weights. The fuselage is a <b>semi-monocoque</b> fiberglass <b>design,</b> mounting a shock-strut suspended retractable monowheel landing gear with an automatic swivelling and retractable tailwheel. The ailerons and dive brakes automatically hook up on aircraft assembly. Due to the fuselage construction the aircraft type certificate contains the restriction [...] "All external portions of the fuselage exposed to sunlight must be painted white, except for a minimum amount of light shaded markings." ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>semi-monocoque</b> <b>design</b> is {{made from}} flush riveted {{aluminum}} sheet. The rudder is covered with doped aircraft fabric. Its 14.12 m span, semi-tapered wing employs a Wortmann FX-60-17A11-182 airfoil at the wing root, transitioning to an FX-60-126 at the wing tip. The wing has an area of 11 m2 and mounts top surface Schempp-Hirth-style air brakes.|$|E
5000|$|The TS-8 was an {{all-metal}} low-wing cantilever monoplane, with metal-covered semi-monocoque fuselage, oval in cross-section. The three-part single-spar wing, of <b>semi-monocoque</b> <b>design,</b> {{creating a}} transverse inverted gull wing [...] "W" [...] shape. It had a Tricycle retractable landing gear, and a 7-cylinder WN-3 radial engine in front, delivering 330 hp take-off power and 283 hp normal {{power to a}} 2.2 m diameter two-blade variable pitch wooden propeller.|$|E
50|$|The B1 is {{the first}} car of the series, and also the first car {{produced}} by Marussia Motors. The car's structure is an aluminum <b>semi-monocoque</b> <b>design.</b> The car's engines are produced by British engineering company Cosworth. Marussia plan to only produce 2999 B1s. Engine power is 360 or 420 hp, top speed is 250 km/h (155 mph) and it accelerates from 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 3.8 seconds.|$|E
50|$|When {{fitted with}} a new plywood <b>semi-monocoque</b> {{fuselage}} <b>designed</b> by the Engineering Division of the US Army Air Service and powered by a Wright-Hispano engine, the US-built Bristol Fighter was designated as the XB-1A and XB-1B. The XB-1A was armed {{with a pair of}} Marlin machine guns at the pilot's position while the XB-1B was armed with a pair of Browning machine guns instead. These aircraft were reportedly intended for use as night observation aircraft. Three prototypes were built by the Engineering division at McCook Field, with a further 44 aircraft built by the Dayton-Wright Company. According to Bruce, despite substantial efforts to differentiate and modify the aircraft's design, none of the American-built Fighters performed any better than the original Bristol Fighter.|$|R
2500|$|The steel Italian cars {{differed}} from the original AMC design in having fewer but functional rear decklid louvers, louvered hoods, and, in some cases, hood scoops to direct fresh air into the heating-A/C system. Further engineering improvements and road testing was done by BMW, which declared the AMX/3's chassis one of the stiffest having a 50% higher stiffness compared to a benchmark Mercedes-Benz model. The car's steel <b>semi-monocoque</b> chassis <b>design</b> with its welded on steel body provided a strong overall structure while the top speed was only verified to , [...] with reports indicating the AMX/3 could go faster {{if it was not}} for the tendency for the font end to lift at those speeds, but BMW found the car to be most neutral handling they had ever tested. The BMW engineers also refined numerous components of the AMX/3 into [...] "a world-class contender among the mid-engined super car elite of its time." ...|$|R
50|$|As on the ER1, the ER2 car {{bodies are}} of a welded {{all-metal}} <b>semi-monocoque</b> load-bearing <b>design</b> (the entire car body bears all structural loads). The framework is built up from bent and extruded steel profiles, and consists of ring frames which are covered with corrugated sheet steel 1.5-2.5 mm thick. The automatic couplers and their shock absorbers are mounted on short spine beams {{at each end of}} the car. The doors and wire conduits are made of aluminum, which helped to keep the weight down and resulted in the cars being only slightly heavier than those of the ER1. Footboards are fitted under the outside of each door for boarding and alighting to/from low platforms; when boarding/alighting passengers to/from high platforms, these are covered by metal aprons (gap fillers). The end bulkheads of each car (except for the head end of the driving trailer, which is occupied by the engineer's cab) incorporate swing-down transfer platforms which allow passengers to walk between cars; these also damp the cars' pitching motion when the train is moving. The cars are 19.600 m long and 3480 mm wide. The power cars weigh 54.6 t, the driving trailers 40.9 t, and the intermediate trailers 38.3 t.|$|R
50|$|Fry was a Formula Two {{constructor}} {{from the}} United Kingdom. The team {{was founded by}} David Fry and Alec Issigonis, whose previous employer John Parkes at Alvis brought his son Mike Parkes as a development driver. The car, built to Formula 2 specifications, was fitted with a Coventry Climax engine and was constructed with several advanced concepts, featuring a <b>semi-monocoque</b> <b>design,</b> an extreme forward driving position and a shark fin on its rear.|$|E
50|$|Messerschmitt omitted the {{internal}} bomb load requirement from the RLM directive {{to increase the}} armament element of the RLM specification. The Bf 110 was far superior to its rivals in providing the speed, range and firepower to meet its role requirements. By the end of 1935, the Bf 110 had evolved into an all-metal, low-wing cantilever monoplane of <b>semi-monocoque</b> <b>design</b> featuring twin vertical stabilizers and powered by two DB 600A engines. The design was also fitted with Handley-Page wing slots(actually, leading-edge slats).|$|E
50|$|The IAR 99 Șoim (Hawk) is an {{advanced}} trainer and light attack aircraft capable of performing {{close air support}} and reconnaissance missions. The IAR 99 replaced the Aero L-29 Delfin and Aero L-39 Albatros as jet trainer of the Romanian Air Force. The aircraft is of <b>semi-monocoque</b> <b>design,</b> with tapered wings and a swept back tail unit. A large blade-type antenna installed beneath the nose {{on the port side}} of the fuselage gives the IAR 99 trainer a distinctive appearance.|$|E
50|$|The chassis {{has been}} {{adapted from the}} {{integrated}} bodyframe, <b>semi-monocoque,</b> independently suspended <b>design</b> which debuted on the Discovery 3 in 2004. This allegedly gives the Range Rover Sport the refinement and structural rigidity advantages of a monocoque chassis with the robustness of a separate chassis design for off-road applications. It also allows for less expensive manufacturing of the vehicles due to {{a large number of}} common components. Although sitting on {{a modified version of the}} Discovery 3’s chassis, it is smaller than its more utilitarian sibling in every dimension with a wheelbase shorter by 140 mm. Its smaller dimensions and its raked roofline make it impossible to accommodate third-row occupants like the Discovery 3, but as a sports tourer it was never intended to be a seven-seater. Brembo front brakes are standard on all models except the TDV6.|$|R
50|$|Projekt 6 was {{essentially}} a scaled-up version of Vogts last design at Kawasaki, the Kawasaki Ki-5. Built entirely of metal and using a <b>semi-monocoque</b> fuselage, the <b>design</b> {{looked more like a}} fighter - specifically like the Heinkel He 112 - than a dive bomber. The wing used the tubular spar system, the inner portion of which was sealed as a fuel tank holding 270 L (70 US gal). The design used fixed landing gear, so in order to reduce their length and their resulting drag, the wings featured a sharp inverted gull wing bend at about ¼ span. The wheels were mounted on two shock absorbers each, so the fairing around the gear was large enough to allow the mounting of a 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine gun for testing, and a 20 mm MG FF cannon if required. Two additional 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17s were mounted in the fuselage decking above the engine.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{innovative}} aircraft designs {{have been}} investigated by researchers to address the environmental and economic issues {{for the purpose of}} green aviation. To keep air transport competitive and safe, it is necessary to maximize design efficiencies of the aircrafts in terms of weight and cost. The purpose of this paper focuses on the research which has {{led to the development of}} a novel lattice-fuselage design of a forward-swept wing aircraft in the conceptual phase by topology optimization technique. In this paper, the fuselage structure is modelled with two different types of elements - 1 D beam and 2 D shell- for the validation purpose. Then, the finite element analysis coupled with topology optimization is performed to determine the structural layouts indicating the efficient distributed reinforcements. Following that, the optimal fuselage designs are obtained by comparison of the results of 1 D and 2 D models. The topological results reveal the need for horizontal stiffeners to be concentrated near the upper and lower extremities of the fuselage cross section and a lattice pattern of criss-cross stiffeners should be well-placed along the sides of the fuselage and near the regions of window locations. The slight influence of windows on the optimal reinforcement layout is observed. To form clear criss-cross stiffeners, modelling the fuselage with 1 D beam elements is suggested, whereas the less computational time is required for the optimization of the fuselage modelled using 2 D shell elements. The authors propose a novel lattice fuselage design in use of topology optimization technique as a powerful design tool. Two types of structural elements are examined in order to obtain the clear reinforcement detailing, which is also in agreement with the design of the DLR(German Aerospace Center) demonstrator. The optimal lattice layout of the stiffeners is distinctive to the conventional <b>semi-monocoque</b> fuselage <b>design</b> and this definitely provides valuable insights into the more efficient utilization of composite materials for novel aircraft designs...|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the earliest models which had wings and tails with wooden frames, M20s are entirely constructed of metal. All are low-wing aircraft, and the wing skin is aluminum. Slotted flaps cover 70% of the trailing edge. Earlier models use a hydraulic hand pump to extend the flaps, while later models have electrically operated flaps. The forward fuselage has a steel tube cabin structure covered in aluminum skin; the aft portion of the fuselage is of <b>semi-monocoque</b> <b>design.</b> In many places on the skin of the airplane, flush-mounted rivets are used to reduce drag.|$|E
50|$|The {{all-metal}} fuselage uses {{conventional and}} straightforward construction methods, being a <b>semi-monocoque</b> <b>design</b> manufactured in three sections. The forward section, which was produced separate {{to the others}} before being rivetted to the centre fuselage, contains various radio navigation and communication equipment such as radio direction finder, transponder, ultra high frequency (UHF) radio, and {{identification friend or foe}} (IFF); the nose typically contained a total of three cameras. The cockpit is positioned directly above the chin-mounted air intake for the engine. It is surrounded on three sides with steel armour plating, the glass windshield is also armoured. The cockpit is furnished with a Martin-Baker Mk.4 ejector seat; it is both pressurised and equipped with manually controlled climate controls.|$|E
5000|$|A stopgap {{solution}} to the flexing problems was to weld extra tubes around the cockpit of the Mk4. When the revised Mk4A was introduced its most significant difference was {{in a number of}} body panels that were welded to the chassis in what Lola described as a <b>semi-monocoque</b> <b>design.</b> With the uprated designs results continued to trickle in, but a lack of development funding stunted the cars competitive growth, {{and by the end of}} the season both the Mk4 and 4A were completely outclassed. It was only in Intercontinental Formula racing, with the addition of the [...] version of the FPF straight-four, that the car showed some promise. Two such-equipped Mk4 cars were shipped to New Zealand and Australia for their respective Grands Prix in early 1963, where regular driver Surtees was partnered by up-and-coming South African Tony Maggs. In his last two races for the Bowmaker team, before signing with Ferrari, Surtees won the New Zealand Grand Prix and finished second in the Australian Grand Prix, a month later. Maggs failed to finish on either occasion.|$|E
5000|$|Max Harlow was an {{aeronautical}} engineer and {{instructor at the}} Pasadena Junior College. Under his tutelage, the aircraft designated PJC-1 was designed and built as a class project. The PJC-1 first flew on 14 September 1937 at Alhambra, California but it crashed during an extended (more than six turn) spin test with {{the center of gravity}} ballasted to the aft limit, as it was going through the certification process—a problem generally laid at the feet the unusually rigorous spin test requirement and the government test pilot, who bailed out of the airplane after the spin [...] "flattened out." [...] The airplane struck the ground, still in the [...] "flat" [...] (longitudinally level) attitude in a bean field near Mines Field (now Los Angeles International Airport) with considerable damage; although repairable, the PJC-1 was never returned to service. PJC students then built a slightly modified airplane, which limited aileron travel with full aft-stick and incorporated a slightly larger vertical stabilizer. This became the PJC-2 model, serial number 1 certified by the FAA on 20 May 1938. It was one of the first, if not the first, airplane designed and built in the U.S. with a stressed-skin <b>semi-monocoque</b> structure—a revolutionary <b>design</b> feature for the time. Harlow saw the potential and formed the Harlow Aircraft Company to build PJC-2 aircraft at Alhambra Airport. Four aircraft were impressed into United States Army Air Forces service with the designation UC-80 in 1942, and used by Civil Aeronautics Administration inspectors after WW II.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} Junkers {{aircraft}} production {{begins with the}} Junkers J 1 mid-wing monoplane (not {{to be confused with}} the later, all-metal sesquiplane ground attack aircraft J.I which had a factory designation of J 4). Research for this aircraft began in 1914 and was interrupted by the start of the First World War. The prototype aircraft, named the Blechesel (Tin or Sheet-metal Donkey), was completed in very late 1915 after the outbreak of the war. This aircraft is significant in that it was the first flyable aircraft to utilize an all-metal [...] "total structural" [...] design. Contemporary aircraft were built around wooden frames constructed in a rib-and-stringer fashion, reinforced with wires, and covered with a stretched fabric. The J 1 was a <b>semi-monocoque</b> <b>design,</b> using steel ribs and sheeting that formed both the stringers and the skin. At the time aluminium was still fairly expensive and the desirable, newest light duralumin alloy could not be worked in sheet form without damaging flaking occurring, so the J 1 was made of sheet electrical steel. It was quite heavy as a result, which translated into poor climb and maneuverability, yet its clean monoplane layout, which even featured a [...] "belly" [...] radiator installation for its Mercedes D.II inline-six cylinder engine, had very low drag, and the J 1 was one of the fastest aircraft of its day, reaching speeds of 170 km/h, with only a 120 hp engine for power.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{methodology}} for the evaluation of transport aircraft fuselages constructed in a <b>semi-monocoque</b> <b>design.</b> Static design and crashworthiness aspects are coupled at an early design stage in order to avoid time- and cost-intensive redesign activities in the subsequent detailed design stage: A fuselage barrel was computed statically and dynamically using finite element methods. Static analysis was conducted using a global/local approach in which the section loads of the global model were used as load introduction in the local model. Subsequently, a crash analysis was performed, and the results from both disciplines were evaluated by an optimization and a parameter variation algorithm, proving functionality of the methodology. However, in this early stage of methodology development only one exemplary static load case is considered and the fuselage design is limited to a constant section. The process chain introduced in this paper uses a parameterized approach, making this methodology applicable for each fuselage in <b>semi-monocoque</b> <b>design...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyze {{the design of the}} Formula SAE roll cage both analytical and by numerical methods. This analysis is based on the dynamic loads experienced by the roll cage under normal driving conditions, along with the torsional stiffness of the roll cage. A roll cage which is torsionally stiff enables a desirable roll moment distribution to be achieved for good handling balance. A roll cage which can absorb high energy impacts whilst controlling the rate of deceleration will increase the likelihood of drivers surviving a crash without injury. This work describes how a common model of the roll cage is developed using catia v 5 and Hyper Mesh to allow both linear and non-linear Finite Element Analysis to be performed by LS-DYNA software. The results from this analytical calculations will be used in future designs of Formula SAE roll cage, with the recommendations made that the future design incorporate stressed mild steel and carbon-fiber skins on a tubular space frame. This is in preparation for a future <b>semi-monocoque</b> <b>design.</b> Improvements for the testing procedures include a need for a lighter and more accurate car swing setup, along with a more rigid torsional test...|$|E
