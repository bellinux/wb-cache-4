40|$|Until {{now there}} has been no robust (socio) {{linguistic}} documentation of urban sign language varieties in Indonesia, and given the size of the Indonesian archipelago, it might be expected that these varieties are very different from each other. In this kind of situation, sign linguists have often applied lexicostatistical methods, but two such studies in Indonesia have recently produced contradictory results. Instead, this investigation uses conceptual and methodological approaches from linguistic typology and Variationist Sociolinguistics, contextualised by a sociohistorical account of the Indonesian sign community. The grammatical domains of completion and negation are analysed using a corpus of spontaneous data from two urban centres, Solo and Makassar. Four completive particles occur in both varieties, alongside clitics and the expression of completion through mouthings alone. The realisations of two variables, one lexical and one grammatical, are predicted by factors including the syntactic and functional properties of the variant, and younger Solonese signers are found to favour completive clitics. The reasons for intra-individual persistence and variation are also discussed. Negation is expressed through particles, clitics, <b>suppletives,</b> and the simultaneous mouthing of predicates with negative particles. These paradigmatic variants occur in both varieties, with small differences in the sets of particles and <b>suppletives</b> for each variety. The realisations of four variables are found to be conditioned by factors including predicate type, sub-function, and the use of constructed dialogue. The gender of the signer is found to correlate with the syntactic order of negative and predicate; younger Solonese signers are also found to favour negative clitics and <b>suppletives.</b> The similarities revealed between the Solo and Makassar varieties are discussed with reference to the history of contact between sign sub-communities across the archipelago. The investigation concludes with a discussion of factors that favour and disfavour the convergence of urban sign language varieties...|$|R
5000|$|Bloomfield {{described}} {{the process of}} disfixation (which he called minus features) through an example from French although most contemporary analyses find this example to be inadequate because the masculine forms might be taken as the base form and the feminine forms simply as <b>suppletives.</b> Though not productive like Muscogean and therefore not true disfixation, some French plurals are analysed as derived from the singular, and many masculine words from the feminine by dropping the final consonant and making some generally predictable changes to the vowel: ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study investigates {{variable}} {{past tense}} marking patterns in an emerging variety of N. C. Hispanic English (n= 44) spoken by language learners at three Length of Residency (LOR) groups in three schools in Durham, NC {{in terms of}} 1. lexical semantics (Andersen & Shirai 1996, Bayley 1999), 2. frequency (Guy & Erker 2012) 3. discourse structure (Bardovi-Harlig 1998) and 4. verb class and phonological environment (Wolfram 1985, Bayley 1994). Statistical results show significant effects of verb class, lexical aspect, and frequency and interacting effects of verb class and frequency (specifically, <b>suppletives</b> like copula are simultaneously highly frequent and highly phonetically salient). A subsample coded for the discourse factor shows some evidence for the correlation of copula and backgrounding function. A separate analysis of consonant cluster reduction patterns (CCR) demonstrates dialect acquisition of variable constraints (e. g. in terms of N. C. AAVE), namely phonological environment (_C > _V) and morphemic status (monomorpheme > bimorpheme). Pedagogical applications are discussed, including accurately identifying English Language Learners (ELLs) {{in the context of}} local/regional accommodation. Dissertatio...|$|R
25|$|The postpositions of Seri inflect for {{the person}} of their complement: hiti 'on me', miti 'on you', iti 'on her/him/it'. Some of them have <b>suppletive</b> stems to {{indicate}} a plural complement; compare miihax 'with you (sg.)' and miicot 'with you (pl.)'.|$|E
25|$|These are a subtype of unprefixed nouns. As {{with proper}} names, gender is not transparently marked on possessed nouns, which take gender {{agreement}} {{according to the}} natural sex of the referent. Plurals are either <b>suppletive</b> or made with the preposed pluralizer id. Most possessed nouns are consanguinal kinship terms which require a possessive suffix (the table contains a selection).|$|E
25|$|Nouns inflect for {{plurality}} through suffixation. Compare noosi 'mourning dove' and noosi-lc 'mourning doves'. Pluralization is very complicated; {{for this}} reason, each noun {{is listed in}} the dictionary with its plural form. Some nouns ostensibly use an infix to indicate plural: caatc 'grasshopper', caatjc 'grasshoppers'. A few nouns have completely <b>suppletive</b> plural forms: cmiique 'Seri person', comcáac 'Seri people', ziix 'thing', xiica 'things'.|$|E
25|$|Feminization: Generally, male nouns {{form their}} {{feminine}} by the suffixation of a vowel. For example, كلب kalb > كلبة kalba, جدّ jadd > جدّة jadda, بطل bṭal > بطلة baṭla. Some male nouns, however, do not form their feminine by the suffixation of a, but have <b>suppletive</b> female counterparts. For example, راجل rājel > مرا mra, ولد wlad > طفلة ṭufla, بو bū > أمّ umm.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are also}} {{irregular}} and <b>suppletive</b> plurals. The feminine singular suffix -t is naturally lost [...] in the plural.|$|E
2500|$|One {{adjective}} is suppletive: lille, [...] "little, small" [...] (n- and t-form and definite e-form) ~ små (plural e-form), småt (adverb t-form). Six adjectives are <b>suppletive</b> in {{the three}} degrees of comparison: god, bedre, bedst, [...] "good, better, best"; dårlig, værre, værst, [...] "bad, worse, worst"; gammel, ældre, ældst, [...] "old, older, oldest", mange, flere, flest; [...] "many, more, most"; megen/-et, mere, mest, [...] "much, more, most"; lille / lidt, mindre, mindst [...] "little, less / smaller, least / smallest". Irregular, but not <b>suppletive</b> are få, færre, færrest, [...] "few, fewer, fewest" [...] and nær, nærmere, nærmest, [...] "close, closer, closest".|$|E
2500|$|The verbal stem {{itself can}} also express {{grammatical}} distinctions. The plurality of the absolutive participant {{can be expressed}} by complete reduplication of the stem or by a <b>suppletive</b> stem. Reduplication can also express [...] "plurality of the action itself", intensity or iterativity. With respect to TA marking, verbs are divided in 4 types; ḫamṭu is always the unmarked TA. The stems of the 1st type, regular verbs, do not express TA at all according to most scholars, or, according to M. Yoshikawa and others, express marû TA by adding an (assimilating) /-e-/ as in gub-be2 or gub-bu vs gub (which is, however, nowhere distinguishable from the first vowel of the pronominal suffixes except for intransitive marû 3rd person singular). The 2nd type express marû by partial reduplication of the stem as kur9 vs ku4-ku4; the 3rd type express marû by adding a consonant (te vs teĝ3); and the 4th type use a <b>suppletive</b> stem (dug4 vs e). Thus, {{as many as four}} different <b>suppletive</b> stems can exist, as in the admittedly extreme case of the verb [...] "to go": ĝen ("to go", ḫamṭu sing.), du (marû sing.), (e-)re7 (ḫamṭu plur.), sub2 (marû plur.) ...|$|E

Imperatives in the second person singular are also suffixless, e.g. Siik! [...] "Come!" [...] One verb, taak [...] "go", has a <b>suppletive</b> imperative mang! or bang! [...] "go!".|$|E

50|$|Many of {{the verb}} stems {{regularly}} are suppletive: intransitive verbs are <b>suppletive</b> for singular versus plural subject and transitive verbs are <b>suppletive</b> for singular versus plural object.
