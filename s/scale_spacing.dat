We collected {{data on the}} occurrence of ground-foraging ant species in 22 ombrotrophic bogs and adjacent forest plots of New England to test two general assembly rules: reduced co-occurrence of species among communities, and even spacing of body sizes of species within communities. We used null models to generate random communities unstructured by competition and evaluated patterns at regional and local spatial scales. At the regional scale, species co-occurrence in forests, but not bogs, was less than expected by chance, whereas, at the local scale, co-occurrence in both habitats was not different from random. At the regional <b>scale,</b> <b>spacing</b> of body size distributions was random (in bogs) or aggregated (in forests). At the local scale, body size patterns were weakly segregated in bogs, but random or weakly aggregated in forests. In bogs, size ratio constancy was accompa-nied by greater generic diversity than expected. Although assembly rules were originally developed for vertebrate communities, they successfully explained some patterns in New England ant assemblages. However, the patterns were contingent on spatial scale, and were distinctly different for bog and forest communities, despite their close proximity {{and the presence of}} many shared species in both assemblages.

There has been research for developing wave energy converters since {{the late eighteenth century}} when the first patent was applied for in 1799 [1], without any remarkable breakthrough. This master thesis will discuss the topic of wave energy conversion by a point absorber in heave with a directly coupled induction machine power take off. A wave to wire approach has been attempted in this thesis. The tool needed is a hydrodynamic model combined with a full model of an electrical generator. The tool is developed to investigate challenges for wave energy conversion by direct coupled induction machine as power take off. Simulations have been carried out in the time domain to study the motion of a point absorber in heave for energy extraction. Previous research in wind power technology show that the grid side converter will handle the voltage fluctuations; which is affected by the power fluctuations [2]. The wave power phenomena is more challenging, fluctuations occur for both long and short time <b>scale.</b> <b>Spacing</b> the platforms in accordance to the wave climate is shown to be a proper manner of approaching the power smoothing issue before entering the point of common coupling in the electric network. Results show that effort should be put into research for control strategies and generator control, bearing in mind that the rating of the converter and generator is directly affected by the torque demands. The choice of control strategy, point absorber, and generator should therefore be taken simultaneously, on the basis off economical aspects. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Morphological and linear <b>scale</b> <b>spaces</b> are {{well-established}} {{instruments in}} image analysis. They display interesting analogies which make a deeper insight into their mutual relation desirable. A {{contribution to the}} understanding of this relation is presented here. We embed morphological dilation and erosion <b>scale</b> <b>spaces</b> with paraboloid structure functions into families of <b>scale</b> <b>spaces</b> which are found to include linear Gaussian <b>scale</b> <b>space</b> as limit cases. The scale-space families are obtained by deforming the algebraic operations underlying the morphological <b>scale</b> <b>spaces</b> within a family of algebraic operations related to l p norms and generalised means. Alternatively, the deformation of the morphological <b>scale</b> <b>spaces</b> can be described in terms of grey-scale isomorphisms. We discuss aspects of the newly constructed <b>scale</b> <b>space</b> families such as continuity, invariance, and separability, and the limiting procedure leading to linear <b>scale</b> <b>space.</b> This limiting procedure requires a suitable renormalisation of the scaling parameter.

Fabrication of solid state devices investigating bacteria, viruses, proteins and even at such smaller sizes as of DNA can create a large arsenal of highly specific and ultrasensitive biosensors and systems. ^ This work shows the use of two important silicon based electrical frameworks to investigate DNA molecules towards {{the development of a}} variety of biosensors. First, a novel method employing metal electrodes with nanometer <b>scale</b> <b>spacing</b> was used {{to examine the effects of}} the GC-content in the dry strands of the DNA on its DC resistance. A dramatic decrease in conductance was also reported on heating the DNA devices, analogous to an electrical fuse, attributable to complete or partial denaturing of the ds-DNA molecules that bridged the nanogaps. These findings have applications like nonoptical detection of extremely low concentrations, biophysical studies of charge transport, and control of DNA-modified materials. Second, solid state nanopores, progenitors of rapid and cheap next-generation DNA sequencing “machines”, were designed to be selective to important DNA sequences. To our knowledge, this work was the first evidence of engineering selectivity in solid state nanopores. Distinctly different translocation signatures and event frequencies were discovered for important DNA targets. This work demonstrated the first experimental evidence of facilitated transport theory based on interactions between channel binding sites and the single DNA molecule. ^ The selective solid-state nanopores realized in an array format can open avenues to novel devices for sequencing, detection of single nucleotide polymorphism, expression analysis, etc. as well as detection of specific proteins using specific ligand-receptor systems from very few copies of the analytes. Such selectivity can be electrically measured and can be used for direct label-free sequencing and detection of nucleic acids. These devices can potentially mimic the exquisite selectivity found in natural biological channels in cell or nuclear membranes, and help unravel the physics of selective and facilitated transport of biomolecules in nanoscale channels. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{controls}} on glacial movement remain {{one of the}} most poorly understood elements of the glacial system, largely due to the inaccessibility of the subglacial environment. Here a geotechnical study is presented that investigates the behaviour of till under pore pressure controlled decreases in normal effective stress. This is supplemented with field data from subglacial wireless probes, dGPS, GPR and a UAV survey of the glacial foreland to provide a broad view of subglacial deformation at Skalafellsjökull, Iceland The geotechnical laboratory investigation was undertaken on till sampled from an ice marginal location at Skalafellsjökull, close to the probe deployment site. This showed that the till adhered to the Mohr-Coulomb model, behaving plastically. In addition, a back pressure shear box was used to model pore pressure controlled reductions in normal effective stress. Linearly reducing normal effective stress by increasing back pressure resulted in episodic increases in horizontal strain rates. Small reductions in shear stress resulted in large strain rate reductions but dilation hardening did not occur. Dilation hardening has previously been suggested as a causal factor in stick-slip glacial motion and a reason for the apparent scale dependence of till rheology, but these experiments suggest it may not be as significant as previously thought. High spatial variability was found throughout the field investigation in probe, dGPS and mapping data from the UAV survey. dGPS deployed above in situ subglacial probes recorded hourly ice movement indicative of stick-slip motion but {{it was not possible to}} link this motion to subglacial processes via probe data. Pore pressure data suggested spatially variable coupling to the subglacial hydrological system and inconsistent forcing by surface melt. Tilt data showed consistent movement patterns and lacked regular up-glacier movements previously thought to indicate ice-bed decoupling and sliding. The lack of evidence for forcing of velocity variability from the in situ data suggests a global forcing mechanism at this site, probably longitudinal or lateral coupling to higher velocity areas of the glacier. The spatial variability of the subglacial data has similarities to the metre <b>scale</b> <b>spacing</b> of flutes on the foreland mapped with the UAV imagery, suggesting flute formation has potential to result in complex probe behaviour...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} renewed {{interest}} {{over the past}} decade or two in the potential of using thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems for direct conversion of thermal energy into electricity. The invention of TPV systems can be traced to almost 50 years ago, but systems developed over the following 2 - 3 decades lacked in efficiency and power density. Later on, the development of III-V materials with low bandgaps promised higher efficiency and power density, and renewed the research interest in TPV. More ideas emerged recently, including the use of two surfaces separated by nanometer <b>scale</b> <b>spacing</b> to exceed the vacuum blackbody limit, potentially realizing TPV systems with greater power density. A new microscale TPV device structure made of fin-shaped interdigitized emitters and photovoltaic cells offers an increase in the surface area available for radiative energy transfer, which could boost the output power density. In addition, if the spacing between the radiator and converter is of the order of a micron, tunneling of energy could occur, which can improve the power density. A periodic structure can recoup sub-bandgap radiation, since such radiation will pass through the converter and will be absorbed in the radiator, thereby improving efficiency of the device. Some of the above-bandgap photons that pass through the converter could also be recycled between emitters and photovoltaic cells. This thesis presents work done on modeling and fabricating an interdigitized microscale TPV device. The advantage in power density that can be obtained from an interdigitized TPV structure is estimated first by a bulk emissivity and view-factor based model, followed by a thin-film emissivity model. Calculations performed to estimate parameters such as power output, power input(cont.) and conduction heat leakage into the substrate from the radiator, which were crucial to the design ofthe devices, are presented. Crucial steps carried out in the clean room at MIT's Microsystem Technology Labs (MTL) with the objective of microfabricating a set of prototype devices are described. Challenges faced when fabricating the device, and techniques used to address several fabrication and experimental issues are presented. The modeling and fabrication issues addressed in this thesis point towards challenges in the area of (i) modeling nanometer scale radiative heat transfer and (ii) fabricating thermophotovoltaic devices with interdigitized geometry and micron/sub-micron spacing between radiator and converter. by Ashish A.

We {{consider}} α <b>scale</b> <b>spaces,</b> a parameterized class (α ∈ (0, 1]) of <b>scale</b> <b>space</b> representations {{beyond the}} well-established Gaussian <b>scale</b> <b>space,</b> which are {{generated by the}} α-th power of the minus Laplace oper-ator on a bounded domain using the Neumann boundary condition. The Neumann boundary condition ensures {{that there is no}} grey-value flux through the boundary. Thereby no artificial grey-values from outside the image affect the evolution proces, which is the case for the α <b>scale</b> <b>spaces</b> on an unbounded domain. Moreover, the connection between the α <b>scale</b> <b>spaces</b> which is not trivial in the unbounded domain case, becomes straightforward: The generator of the Gaussian semigroup extends to a compact, self-adjoint operator on the Hilbert space L 2 (Ω) and therefore it has a complete countable set of eigen functions. Taking the α-th power of the Gaussian generator simply boils down to taking the α-th power of the corresponding eigenvalues. Consequently, all α <b>scale</b> <b>spaces</b> have exactly the same eigen-modes and can be implemented simultaneously as scale dependent Fourier series. The only difference between them is the (relative) contribution of each eigen-mode to the evolution proces. By introducing the notion of (non-dimensional) relative scale in each α <b>scale</b> <b>space,</b> we are able to compare the various α <b>scale</b> <b>spaces.</b> The case α = 0. 5, where the generator equals the square root of the minus Laplace operator leads to Poisson <b>scale</b> <b>space,</b> which is at least as interesting as Gaussian <b>scale</b> <b>space</b> and can be extended to a (Clifford) analytic <b>scale</b> <b>space.</b> ...|$|R

We concentrate on <b>scale</b> <b>space</b> critical points - points with vanishing gradient with respect to both spatial and scale direction. We show that these points are always saddle points. They {{turn out to be}} extremely useful, since the iso-intensity manifolds through these points provide a <b>scale</b> <b>space</b> hierarchy tree and induce a "pre-segmentation": a segmentation without a priori knowledge. Furthermore, both these <b>scale</b> <b>space</b> saddles and the so-called catastrophe points form the critical points of the parameterised critical curves - the curves along which the spatial critical points move in <b>scale</b> <b>space.</b> This enables one to localise these two types of special points relatively easy and automatically. Experimental results concerning the hierarchical representation and pre-segmentation are given and show results that correspond to a fair degree to both the mathematical and the intuitive forecast...|$|R
