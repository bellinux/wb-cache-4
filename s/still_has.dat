In a final scene, Jean Descole is seen on a cart, preparing his next plan.|$|E

White <b>still</b> <b>has</b> possibilities to play for an advantage due to his more advanced development, his space advantage on the queenside and the possibility to install his knight on the good square d5. Taylor considers this Black's best line, stating that Black has not given White the bishop pair, nor weakened his pawn structure, and {{should be able to}} gradually equalize.|$|E
