5|$|Advances {{were made}} in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably with {{aircraft}} carriers and submarines. Although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship {{in place of the}} battleship.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's {{first six}} regiments {{organized}} during the Civil War were the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th Indiana infantry regiments. The men in these regiments volunteered {{for three months}} of service at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> but their brief terms provided inadequate; most of these soldiers re-enlisted for three additional years of service.|$|E
5|$|The Irish and British {{authorities}} co-operated in the chartering of ships. They made combined {{purchases of}} wheat, maize, sugar, animal feeds and petrol. At the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> Irish ships joined convoys {{protected by the}} Royal Navy. The advantages were protection and cheaper insurance. These advantages were not borne out by experience. So they chose to sail alone.|$|E

2500|$|... 403 BC [...] The {{year when}} Han, Zhao and Wei were officially {{recognised}} as {{states by the}} Zhou court. Author Sima Guang of Zizhi Tongjian tells us that <b>the</b> symbol <b>of</b> eroded Zhou authority should be taken as <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Warring</b> States era.|$|R
5|$|The {{conscription}} of German {{men at the}} <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> {{created a}} manpower shortage in German factories important for the war effort. From 1915, the Germans encouraged Belgian civilians to enlist voluntarily to work in Germany but the 30,000 recruits of the policy proved insufficient to meet demands.|$|E
5|$|The {{second section}} rejoins Stephen, {{when he is}} a {{lieutenant}} in the British Army at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Through his eyes, Faulks tells the reader about the {{first day on the}} Somme in July 1916 and the Battle of Messines near Ypres in the following year.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of the Second World War the family fled Paris; Döblin's manuscripts were able to be brought into {{safekeeping}} {{in the basement of the}} Sorbonne. Between the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in 1939 and the German occupation of France in 1940, Döblin worked for the French ministry of information, writing counter-propaganda texts against Nazi Germany with a group of French Germanists and journalists, as well as artists like Frans Masereel.|$|E

5|$|After the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> with Japan, President Franklin D. Roosevelt {{signed an}} order for {{internment}} {{of all the people}} of Japanese ancestry who lived on the West Coast. About 1,700of them lived in Portland, and some had farms or businesses near the slough. When the government removed them from their homes in 1942, it housed them temporarily in the Livestock Exposition Center (Expo Center) in Kenton before sending them to internment camps further inland. They were not allowed to return until 1945.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> Himmler {{intensified}} {{the activity of}} the SS within Germany and in Nazi occupied Europe. An increasing numbers of Jews and German citizens deemed politically suspect or social outsiders were arrested. As the Nazi regime became more oppressive, the concentration camp system grew in size and lethal operation, and grew in scope as the economic ambitions of the SS intensified.|$|E
5|$|As was {{the case}} with almost all German capital ships during World War I, Moltkes action was {{somewhat}} limited. However, she did participate in most of the major fleet actions conducted by the High Seas Fleet. At the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> the ship was assigned to the I Scouting Group of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Franz Hipper.|$|E

5|$|At 1:55p.m., {{just before}} the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> a {{reconnaissance}} force swam to the east bank of the Suez Canal, two kilometers south of Fort Lahtzanit, and laid two ropes across the canal to facilitate the crossing of friendly forces. At 2:05p.m., as Operation Badr began, an artillery barrage was initiated against the fort using just the 85mm guns and B-10 recoilless rifles of the brigade's anti-tank company; the use of high trajectory artillery guns was forbidden since a number of Egyptian aircraft were flying over this area.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> Australia's {{military}} forces were focused upon the militia and what Regular forces existed were mostly {{serving in the}} artillery or engineers and were assigned in most part {{to the task of}} coastal defence. Due to the provisions of the Defence Act 1903, which precluded sending conscripts overseas, upon the outbreak of war it was realised that a totally separate, all volunteer force would need to be raised. This force was known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF).|$|E
5|$|At the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> the {{population}} of Belgium was overwhelmingly Catholic. Jews made up the largest non-Christian population in the country, numbering between 70–75,000 out of a population of 8 million. Most lived in large towns and cities in Belgium, such as Antwerp and Brussels. The vast majority were recent immigrants to Belgium fleeing persecution in Germany and Eastern Europe and, as a result, only a small minority actually possessed Belgian citizenship.|$|E

50|$|At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spring and Autumn Period, <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> Jin {{was divided}} up between three {{powerful}} ministers; the Zhao family patriarch {{being one of}} them. In 403 BC, <b>the</b> king <b>of</b> Zhou formally recognized <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State <b>of</b> Zhao along with two other States, Han and Wei, marking <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Warring</b> States Period.|$|R

5|$|At the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> the {{population}} of the Congo numbered approximately 12million black people and 30,000 whites. The colonial government segregated {{the population}} along racial lines and there was very little mixing between the colours. The white population was highly urbanized and, in Léopoldville, the capital, lived in a quarter of the city separated from the black majority. All blacks in the city had to adhere to a curfew.|$|E
5|$|Both armies used child soldiers, mainly between 14 and 17 {{years of}} age. The usage of {{juvenile}} soldiers was not rare in World War I; {{children of the}} time were under the absolute authority of adults and generally were not shielded against exploitation. In the Finnish case, the military leaders took whoever they could get their hands on, at the less organised <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> In the Red Guards there was the chance for salary and food.|$|E
5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Liguria {{was assigned to the}} Third Division of the First Squadron as a training ship. Italy declared neutrality at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers. The old cruiser nevertheless saw no action during the war. She was sold for scrap on 15 May 1921 and was subsequently broken up.|$|E

5|$|From the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> a British {{blockade}} on {{shipments to}} Germany affected the Reich economy. The Germans were particularly dependent on foreign supplies of oil, coal and grain. To safeguard Swedish iron ore shipments to Germany, Hitler ordered {{an attack on}} Norway, which took place on 9 April 1940. Much {{of the country was}} occupied by German troops by the end of April. Also on 9 April, the Germans invaded and occupied Denmark.|$|E
5|$|In 194142, McCabe {{played his}} final {{first-class}} match. He scored 8 and 41 as Queensland took a 17-run win. Ten days later, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, prompting the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in the Pacific. With that, first-class cricket was cancelled {{and did not}} resume until 194546, ending McCabe's career {{at the age of}} just 31. He had 24 wins and four losses in 38 first-class matches as captain for all teams. In his last three seasons, McCabe took only one wicket, from 18 overs of bowling.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, 2004 the {{monument}} closed for a $15 million renovation, which included numerous security upgrades and redesign of {{the monument}} grounds by landscape architect Laurie Olin. The renovations were due partly to security concerns following the September 11 attacks and the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> on Terror. The monument reopened April 1, 2005, while the surrounding grounds remained closed until the landscape was finished later that summer.|$|E
