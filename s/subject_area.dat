These experiments varied in their <b>subject</b> <b>area,</b> and were both important in some cases and trivial in others. The society also published an English translation of Essays of Natural Experiments Made in the Accademia del Cimento, under the Protection of the Most Serene Prince Leopold of Tuscany in 1684, an Italian book documenting experiments at the Accademia del Cimento. Although meeting at Gresham College, the Society temporarily moved to Arundel House in 1666 after the Great Fire of London, which did not harm Gresham but did lead to its appropriation by the Lord Mayor. The Society returned to Gresham in 1673.|$|E
5|$|Resource Guides {{are offered}} for the art, economics, {{language}} and literature, music, science/social science, and Super Quiz events. The Super Quiz Resource Guide is {{a compendium of}} previously published articles, whereas the other Resource Guides are composed by individual writers under contract with USAD. The aim of the Resource Guide is to assist students {{in their study of}} the topics listed in the <b>subject</b> <b>area</b> outlines. As an example, in 2003 the music topic was Romantic music. Subsequently the Music Resource Guide focused on the development of Romantic music, its characteristics and the influence of the Classical era on the Romantic era. A large part of the guide focused on information about that year's composers: Beethoven, Berlioz, Rossini, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Verdi, Mussorgsky, Wagner, Bizet, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Mahler and Strauss. Similarly, the art topic assigned was Romantic art in the European tradition. The Art Resource Guide included sections detailing the lives and works of relevant artists such as Joseph Mallord William Turner, Claude Monet, Albert Bierstadt, and Camille Pissarro.|$|E

Under the Horizons curriculum, new undergraduate students have greater choice in what exactly they study in their programme. Under the new curriculum, students choose ten core modules from their specific <b>subject</b> <b>area</b> and two other modules, which can be chosen from any other programme across the entire University (this applies in the majority of programmes, however some exceptions, as in Arts Omnibus and Business & Law, can apply). For example, a student studying Stage 1 Commerce as his primary degree programme can also choose one module (or two) from the Stage 1 Law programme (subject to space availability, timetable constraints and so on).|$|E
25|$|The first category, Writing, is {{separated}} between lower division writing (three courses) and upper division writing (requiring {{the completion of}} a research project). The sixth category, Language Other Than English, can be fulfilled through four quarters of instruction (or more, depending on a student's major requirements). It may alternatively be satisfied by taking three years of a foreign language in high school, passing an AP test on a language other than English with a 4 or 5, or scoring a 620 or better on an SAT II exam on a language other than English. The seventh category, Multicultural Studies and International/Global Issues, contains two subcategories, Multicultural Studies and International/Global Issues. Category VII and the other categories not listed in detail here each require the completion of three courses from a series or <b>subject</b> <b>area.</b> Additionally, students may partially fulfill selected breadth requirements through petition or participation in extracurricular activities.|$|E
25|$|Reporters are {{journalists who}} {{primarily}} report facts {{that they have}} gathered and those who write longer, less news-oriented articles may be called feature writers. Photographers and graphic artists provide images and illustrations to support articles. Journalists often specialize in a <b>subject</b> <b>area,</b> called a beat, such as sports, religion, or science. Columnists are journalists who write regular articles recounting their personal opinions and experiences. Printers and press operators physically print the newspaper. Printing is outsourced by many newspapers, {{partly because of the}} cost of an offset web press (the most common kind of press used to print newspapers) and also because a small newspaper's print run might require less than an hour of operation, meaning that if the newspaper had its own press it would sit idle most of the time. If the newspaper offers information online, webmasters and web designers may be employed to upload stories to the newspaper's website.|$|E
40|$|What are the {{distinct}} and similar <b>subject</b> <b>areas</b> in Educational Administration Master of Arts Programs in USA and Turkey? To {{find the answer}} to this problem, The problem was searched by decomposing into the following sub-problems: 1. 	Which <b>subject</b> <b>areas</b> have the highest course credit in USA and Turkey MA programs ? 2. 	What is the relationship between USA and Turkey MA programs according to their common subject areas’ total course credits ? Survey method was applied in this study. In USA/California State and Turkey, all MA programs whose names are Educational Management/Administration or Educational Leadership were scanned through university web sites and faculty e-mails. As a result of this process, It was determined that there are 34 programs in Turkey and 26 programs in USA/California State among all 132 Turkish and 129 American universities. The most frequent key words included in MA programs’ syllabuses were determined and <b>subject</b> <b>areas</b> corresponding to these key words were brought out. At least three times repeating key words in syllabuses were weighted in respect of their course counts and total course credits and tabulated separately in countries. Frequency analyze of key words, course counts and total course credits, plus Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was applied for data analysis. It was determined that American MA programs have included 94 key words and 53 <b>subject</b> <b>areas.</b> On the other hand, Turkish ones have included 111 key words with at least 4 repetition, and 55 <b>subject</b> <b>areas</b> covering these keywords. By searching these findings in terms of their frequencies and course credits related to key words, It was brought out that: •	In Turkey, MA programs are weighed mostly with Introduction to Educational Management and Educational Supervision <b>subject</b> <b>areas</b> by course credits. •	In USA, MA programs are weighed mostly with Leadership and Curriculum Development/Assessment <b>subject</b> <b>areas</b> by course credits. As a conclusion of this study, the different <b>subject</b> <b>areas</b> taught in USA and Turkey, plus the medium correlation of common <b>subject</b> <b>areas</b> according to their course credits between two countries were brought out. These findings were interpreted with the dissimilarity of two education system and management practices...|$|R
