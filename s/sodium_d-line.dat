It is named according to IUPAC rules as (+)-3-methoxy-17-methyl-9α,13α,14α-morphinan. As its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as an odorless, opalescent white powder. It is freely soluble in chloroform and insoluble in water; the hydrobromide salt is water-soluble up to 1.5g/100 mL at 25°C. Dextromethorphan is commonly available as the monohydrated hydrobromide salt, however some newer extended-release formulations contain dextromethorphan bound to an ion-exchange resin based on polystyrene sulfonic acid.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The {{atmospheric}} sodium daytime abundance {{was measured}} for Corvallis, Oregon, using direct absorption of sunlight by atmospheric sodium atoms, as observed with an optical waveguide spectrum analyzer.

A daytime variation in the atmospheric sodium abundance having a maximum at around noon was observed. Also, a day-to-day variation in the atmospheric sodium abundance was observed.

40|$|With the {{exception}} of the <b>sodium</b> <b>D-lines</b> recent calculations of line broadening cross-sections for several multiplets of sodium by Leininger et al (2000) are in substantial disagreement with cross-sections interpolated from the tables of Anstee and O'Mara (1995) and Barklem and O'Mara (1997). The discrepancy is as large as a factor of three for the 3 p- 4 d multiplet. The two theories are tested by using the results of each to synthesize lines in the solar spectrum. It is found that generally the data from the theory of Anstee, Barklem and O'Mara produce the best match to the observed solar spectrum. It is found, using a simple model for reflection of the optical electron by the potential barrier between the two atoms, that the reflection coefficient is too large for avoided crossings with the upper states of subordinate lines to contribute to line broadening, supporting the neglect of avoided ionic crossings by Anstee, Barklem and O'Mara for these lines. The large discrepancies between the two sets of calculations is a result of an approximate treatment of avoided ionic crossings for these lines by Leininger et al (2000) ...|$|R

[...] Data of questionable quality are removed. It appears that this new study [...] resolves ambiguities present in the original results and allows revised [...] and new interpretations to be advanced. The behavior of prominent auroral emissions has been studied statistically [...] using the IGY patrol spectrograms obtained at College, Alaska during the International [...] Geophysical Year.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} combines {{several new}} {{observations of the}} Io sodium cloud to create a consistent picture of the extended Io atmosphere and its interaction with the Jovian plasma torus. I used the LPL echelle spectrograph to obtain three types of high-resolution spectra of the extended sodium cloud at the <b>sodium</b> <b>D-lines</b> (5890, 5896 Å). The first class of observations made use of the mutual satellite eclipses of 1985 to probe the density profile of {{the atmosphere in the}} range 1. 4 to 10 Io radii, a previously unstudied region. The second type of observation examined the sodium emission in Io's immediate vicinity, allowing an accurate measurement of the velocity structure around Io. The final method employed a high-sensitivity detector to study faint jets of high-speed sodium farther out in the extended cloud. The synthesis of these three data sets results in {{a better understanding of how}} sodium is distributed about Io as a function of position and velocity. Io's extended atmosphere is composed of many kinematically distinct components. The distribution in space is linked to their characteristic velocities, with low-energy sodium confined near Io and faster atoms (10 to 100 km sec⁻¹) prevalent beyond ∼ 25 Io radii. The sodium density profile is steep near Io and shallower outside 5. 6 Io radii, the effective limit of Io's gravity. The data indicate that the atmosphere is collisionally thick near the surface, but becomes thin by an altitude of ∼ 700 km. The upper limit of the exobase location is derived from reliable sodium density measurements made during the satellite eclipses. The lower limit is indirectly inferred from the velocity distribution of sodium near Io and the nature of high-speed jets far from Io. The high-speed sodium jets reveal a new type of close interaction between the corotating plasma and Io's atmosphere. The morphology and brightness of the jets require a two-reaction process, in which atmospheric sodium is ionized, accelerated to high speeds, and then charge-exchanges with other sodium atoms. These processes must occur near the atmospheric exobase, indicating that Io's atmosphere is not completely protected from the plasma flow...|$|R
50|$|In gemology/gemmology, the {{gemstone}} refractometer is one {{the fundamental}} {{pieces of equipment}} used in a gemological laboratory. Gemstones are transparent minerals and can therefore be examined using optical methods. Refractive index is a material constant, dependent on the chemical composition of a substance. The refractometer is used to help identify gem materials by measuring their refractive index, {{one of the principal}} properties used in determining the type of a gemstone. Due to the dependence of the refractive index on the wavelength of the light used (i.e. dispersion), the measurement is normally taken at the wavelength of the <b>sodium</b> line <b>D-line</b> (NaD) of ~589 nm. This is either filtered out from daylight or generated with a monochromatic light-emitting diode (LED). Certain stones such as rubies, sapphires, tourmalines and topaz are optically anisotropic. They demonstrate birefringence based on the polarisation plane of the light. The two different refractive indexes are classified using a polarisation filter. Gemstone refractometers are available both as classic optical instruments and as electronic measurement devices with a digital display.|$|R

Laboratory studies with synthetic monodisperse aerosols were carried out in order to characterize the sensitivity, precision, and linearity of the technique. Experiments were also carried out with aerosols generated from mixed salt solutions and seawater {{in order to determine}} whether ionic or other matrix effects lead to interference. The ASD has a linear response function for NaCl aerosol particles from 100 nm to 2. 0 μm in diameter. The precision of sodium mass measurements is on the order of ± 3 % standard error on replicate measurements, with a quantitative response to the sodium content of a single aerosol particle that is independent of the chemical composition of the particle, i. e. anions, cations, seawater. No interferences were found with major ions in seawater and common atmospheric aerosols. These experiments demonstrate a detection limit equivalent to a 100 nm diameter dry 100 % NaCl aerosol.

40|$|Observations of <b>sodium</b> <b>D-line</b> {{emission}} from Io and the magnetosphere of Jupiter are reported. A disk-shaped {{cloud of}} sodium {{is found to}} exist in the Jovian magnetosphere with an inner edge at about 4 Jovian radii and an outer edge at about 10 Jovian radii. The gravitational scale height above the equatorial plane is a few Jovian radii. The data are interpreted in terms of a sputtering model in which the sodium required to maintain the cloud is sputtered off the surface of Io by trapped energetic radiation-belt protons. Conditions on the atmospheric density are obtained. The Keplerian orbits attainable by such escaping sputtered atoms can provide the observed spatial distribution.

Analysis of Io's ionosphere indicates that the atmosphere may be cooler than the observed sodium and that the exobase probably stands well above Io's surface.

The observed electron profiles and the constraints provided by the emission cloud are consistent with two models of Io's neutral atmosphere. In the first model, hydrogen is supplied by dissociation of ammonia, whereas proton charge exchange is the primary source of hydrogen in the second model.

40|$|Observations of the <b>sodium</b> <b>D-line</b> {{emissions}} {{associated with}} the Galilean satellite Io suggest that the emitting region has two components. The first is an atmosphere which extends 1000 km above Io's surface. This is a relatively dense region which is optically thick in the sodium D lines. The second component is a surrounding optically thin cloud spread out along Io's orbit to form part of a torus. No emission was detected during any of three eclipses observed, although Io's sodium emission was consistently present when Io was near orbital elongation. This indicates that resonant scattering is the principal emission mechanism in both components. For the atmosphere, measurements of the D-line intensity, D- 2 /D- 1 ratio, and line width indicate a temperature of 500 to 1000 K and a sodium column abundance of 3 by 10 to the 13 th power per sq cm. Upper limits to the abundance of Mg, K, Ca, and Li indicate a high sodium abundance ratio in the atmosphere. This may also be true for Io's surface if sputtering by energetic particles {{is the source of}} the atmosphere.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of atomic sodium {{concentration in the}} TTB 019 firing of April 1990 is significant in that it represents the first {{measurement of}} density at the exit plane {{of the space shuttle}} main engine. The knowledge of the sodium density, combined with the certainty that the exit plane of the plume is optically thin at the <b>sodium</b> <b>D-line</b> wavelengths, provides essential information for evaluation of diagnostic techniques using sodium atoms, such as resonant Doppler velocimetry for temperature, pressure, and velocity through high resolution fluorescent lineshape analysis. The technique used for the sodium atom line transmission (SALT) measurements is that of resonant absorption emission using a hollow cathode lamp as the reference source. Through the use of two-dimensional kinetic (TDK) predictions of temperature and density for the flight engine case and radiative transfer calculations, this line-of-sight spectrally integrated transmission indicates a sodium atom concentration, i. e., mole fraction, of 0. 91 e- 10. The subject of this paper is the assumptions and measurement uncertainties tied into the calculation. Because of the narrow shape of the source emission, the uncertainties in the absorption profile could introduce considerable bias in the measurement. The following were investigated: (1) the inclusion of hyperfine splitting of the D-lines in the calculation; (2) the use of the flight engine predictions of plume temperature and density versus those for the large throat engine; (3) the assumption of a Gaussian, i. e., Doppler, distribution for the source radiance with a temperature of 400 K; (4) the use of atomic collisional shift and width values for the work by Jongerius; and (5) a Doppler shift for a 7 degree outward velocity vector at the plume edge.
