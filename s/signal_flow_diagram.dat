This design methodology focuses on 1. smart energy management at runtime and 2. application-specific System-On-Chip (SoC) design at design time, contributing to low-power systems on both algorithmic and technology level. Smart energy management is performed spatially at runtime by a behaviour-based or state-action-driven selection from {{a set of}} different (implemented) algorithms classified by their demand of computation power, and temporally by varying data processing rates.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{computer}} generated images. The thesis {{begins with an}} overview of a generalised computer graphics system, including a brief survey of typical methods for generating photorealistic images. One such technique, ray tracing, is {{used as the basis}} for the work which follows. The overview section concludes with a statement of the aim which is to: Investigate the effective use of available processing power and effective utilisation of available memory by implementing a ray tracing programme which uses space subdivision, multiple processors and a distributed world model database. The problem formulation section describes the ray tracing principle and then introduces the main areas of study. The INMOS Transputer (a building block for concurrent systems) is used to implement the multiple process ray tracer. Space subdivision is achieved by repeated and regular subdivision of a world cube (which contains the scene to be ray traced) into named cubes, called octrees. The subdivision algorithm continues to subdivide space until no octree contains more than a specified number of objects, or until the practical limit of space subdivision is reached. The objects in the world model database are distributed in a round robin manner to the ray trace processes. During execution of the ray trace programme, information about each object is passed between processes by a message mechanism. The concurrent code for the transputer processes, written in OCCAM 2, was developed using timing <b>diagrams</b> and <b>signal</b> <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> derived by analogy from digital electronics. Structure diagrams, modified to be consistent with OCCAM 2 processes, were derived from the timing <b>diagrams</b> and <b>signal</b> <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams.</b> These were used as a basis for the coding. The results show that space subdivision is an effective use of processor power because the number of trial intersections of rays with objects is dramatically reduced. In addition, distribution of the world model database avoids duplication of the database in the memory of each process and hence better utilisation of available memory is achieved. The programmes are supported by a menu driven interface (running on a PC AT) which enables the user to control the ray trace processes running on the transputer board housed in the PC...|$|R

These diagrams {{can be seen}} as string diagrams for the symmetric monoidal category FinVect_k of finite-dimensional vector spaces over the field of rational functions k = R(s), where the variable s acts as differentiation and the monoidal structure is direct sum rather than the usual tensor product of vector spaces.

30|$|Categorical {{network theory}} {{is a general}} {{framework}} to study open networks, namely, networks with explicit input and output nodes such as electrical circuits (Baez and Fong 2015), <b>signal</b> <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> (Baez and Erbele 2015; Bonchi et al. 2014) and chemical reaction networks (Baez and Pollard 2017). It thinks of networks as processes in contrast to network science where networks are thought of as things (Baez 2014). Indeed, the main challenges in network science are analysis and modeling of network structure found in nature and society (Newman 2010; Estrada 2012; Barabási 2016). On the other hand, the primary interest of categorical network theory is the behavior of open networks determined by the relation between inputs and outputs that is revealed by black-boxing the internal structure of networks (Baez and Fong 2015). The divide into networks as things and networks as processes is a natural consequence of the category theoretic perspective. As we explain in next section, a category has two-level structure: objects representing things and morphisms representing processes between things. In categorical network theory, networks are regarded as morphisms. The {{aim of this study}} is to bridge these two different approaches to networks and get a new insight into structure of networks. Our approach is based on a reformulation of our previous work (Haruna 2013 b) that has been developed independently of categorical network theory. However, we reinterpret our previous work as an internalization of the idea of categorical network theory into networks themselves and as a result we find new betweenness centralities that are obscure so far.|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. Data {{communications}} {{have increased}} tremendously {{over the last}} few years. Therefore, it is important to use the potential large bandwidth of the existing optical fibre network to satisfy the demand. Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) enables one to have several channels on a single fibre while the system remains transparent for the bit rate and format of the signals on the individual channels. Erbium doped fibre lasers have narrow linewidths and the wavelength is tunable over the optical amplifier wavelength range. They are therefore very attractive sources to test WDM systems. The exciting possibility of simultaneous laser action at predetermined wavelengths X,, X 2, [...] ., X, makes the fibre laser a very important source for WDM systems. In this work we concentrated on two ring laser configurations. The first one uses a tunable Fabry-Perot filter, whereas the second one has a polarization filter for tunability and wavelength selection. The Fabry-Perot filter had a finesse of 167, a bandwidth of 30. 0 GHz and a free spectral range of 5010 GHz. This laser configuration was tunable from 1546. 52 nm to 1584. 04 nm (37. 52 nm) and the linewidth was less than 0. 037 nm. The polarization filter comprised a 31 X-polarization controller, two XJ 4 -polarization controllers, a X/ 2 -polarization controller for wavelength tunability and a polarizer. This ring laser was tunable from 1559. 59 nm to 1568. 69 nm (9. 1 nm) and had a linewidth of less than 0. 037 nm. We obtained a slope efficiency of 17. 6 % for the erbium doped fibre laser.

This study primarily deals with the analysis and synthesis of existing hydraulic drive systems to eliminate limit cycles and with establishing a design tool for the design of hydraulic drives with the object of avoiding limit cycles. Most analytical results were verified experimentally. The most general methods for the design of practical nonlinear systems are discussed. It is concluded that some form of synthesis and analysis is necessary, and that the need exists for general methods to evaluate the stability of nonlinear systems and design tools for nonlinear system design. Ageneral procedure of system analysis is given. Amathematical model of the system needs to be obtained, which can be done with the aid of bond graphs. Simulations of complex systems are recommended to verify system performance only. The first procedure of system analysis that should be followed is to systematically identify elements of the system which are not related to the cause of the limit cycle. Experimental testing is a good first step in identifying the non-critical elements. <b>Signal</b> <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> enable the engineer quickly to determine all feedback loops of a complicated system which might be critical. Block diagrams are necessary for the application of nonlinear analysis and synthesis techniques. Hydraulic resonance, where the actuator seal acts as an oscillating mechanism, is identified as a possible cause of the limit cycle. An unusual application of the describing function, where the describing function is applied to optimize the hydraulic supply, is discussed. The transfer function of flow in a hydraulic pipe is given. With the use of the describing function, the gain margin can be studied versus different parameters of the plant. This gives insight into slightly damped conditions of the hydraulic supply that might be the cause of a limit cycle in the system. A control gain does not change the dynamic behaviour of the hydraulic supply, but only amplifies certain natural modes of the system. The design application of the describing function to nonlinear hydraulic drives is discussed. Procedures to eliminate an existing limit cycle and to design a nonlinear hydraulic drive system are proposed. Most important of all, is to design the system so that the natural frequencies of the mechanical structure and the hydraulic supply do not have any common multiples...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{the first}} part of this study, {{determination}} of the dielectric properties of the low loss microwave ceramic material, barium nonatitanate (Ba 2 Ti 9 O 20), around 1 GHz is discussed. The structures under test were coaxial resonators, the cores of which were made of barium nonatitanate and the metallization was realised by thick film silver. The measured value of the real part of the relative dielectric constant was εr =  37 and that of the loss tangent was tan σ =  0. 00014. The change of the resonance frequency of the coaxial resonators with temperature, in the range - 20 … + 80  C, was 4 ppm/ C. In addition, realisation of compact interdigital and comb-line bandpass filters was demonstrated for the 900 MHz mobile phone band. Besides Ba 2 Ti 9 O 20, Ba(Sm,Nd) 2 Ti 5 O 14 ceramic material with a dielectric constant of εr =  78 was also employed in order to improve the miniaturisation. The volume of the smallest filter was 2 cm 3 and the weight was 9 g. In the second part of this study, various measurement methods have been demonstrated to determine the real part of the relative permittivity of FR 4 fibreglass circuit board. Test structures were straight asymmetric open-circuited strip lines. It was found that the real part of the relative permittivity decreased slightly with frequency. At 0. 72 GHz and 4. 5 GHz, εr values of 4. 3 and 4. 1, respectively, were measured. All the characterisation methods used gave consistent values for εr, and electromagnetic simulators were used to verify the results. In the third part of this study, the structures under test were microstrip or strip line transmission lines, the S parameters of which were measured by using on-wafer measurement techniques. It was found that the insertion loss of the 10 mm long etched Cu microstrip was slightly less than that of the Ag microstrips which were manufactured by etching and gravure offset printing techniques, respectively. The performance of the Ag microstrips was, however, similar. In addition, a theoretical basis was established for the determination of εr of the dielectric substrate and the attenuation coefficient of the transmission lines under test. The calculations were based on <b>signal</b> <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The method was applied to determine the dielectric and loss properties of a commercial, Kyocera, Japan, LTCC (Low Temperature Cofired Ceramic) material up to 50 GHz. The measured value of the real part of the relative permittivity was εr =  5. 7, and the loss tangent was approximately tan σ =  0. 003. The essential idea behind the studies reported in this thesis was twofold. First, the studies aimed at characterising dielectric media which find usage in the realisation of UHF, microwave or millimetre wave circuits.
