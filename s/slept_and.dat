He made particular requests when traveling to foreign nations. During his trips to Rome, Paris, Madrid, Moscow, and New York City, he resided in a bulletproof tent, following his Bedouin traditions. Gaddafi was notably confrontational in his approach to foreign powers, and generally shunned Western ambassadors and diplomats, believing them to be spies.|$|E
5|$|Scotland Yard {{suspected}} Martin {{of having}} separately killed two men from south London: financial adviser Timothy MacDowall and accountant William Shackel. In Mexico, Martin had discussed {{with his wife}} about going scuba diving with MacDowall, who was taking scuba lessons while on holiday on an island off Belize. MacDowall disappeared in Belize in early 1995 but police could not conclusively match him to body parts later found in that country; the only suspicious activity they uncovered was the transfer of £21,000 from MacDowall's bank account to an account in San Francisco under Martin's name. MacDowall {{is believed to have}} been murdered as he <b>slept</b> <b>and</b> his remains thrown into a crocodile-infested river. Martin refused to be interviewed by Scotland Yard while he was on death row in Changi Prison, thus whether he killed MacDowall remains unconfirmed. Shackel was reported missing while on holiday in Cancún, Mexico. Police reports said that Martin was in Cancún the day Shackel cashed traveller's cheques worth £4,000, after which he disappeared.|$|E

25|$|With {{the death}} of Rebbe Yissachar Dov in 1926, the mantle of {{leadership}} fell on his eldest son, Rabbi Aharon Rokeach, who was 49 {{years old at the}} time. A deeply spiritual, almost mystical man, who studied much and <b>slept</b> <b>and</b> ate little, Rebbe Aharon was known for his saintliness and his miracle-working capabilities. Many of his followers reported experiencing miraculous recoveries or successes after receiving his blessing, and flocked to his court by the thousands.|$|E
25|$|The Kitchen Chamber {{is where}} the {{servants}} <b>slept</b> <b>and</b> food was stored. It is unpanelled and has no ceiling. Its position next to the back stairs and above the kitchen made it accessible to the servants. Many local houses used their kitchen chambers for storage. In 1611 it had five arks for storing meal and grain. Today it has one great ark {{and a collection of}} food chests. Lack of a fireplace and unpanelled walls would have made it cold in winter, although warmth from the kitchen below would keep the stored food dry.|$|E

25|$|Cnut's {{death in}} 1035 was {{followed}} by a period of political uncertainty, as the succession was disputed between his sons. In 1036 Alfred, son of King Æthelred, returned from Normandy, where he had been taken for safety as a child at the time of Cnut's conquest of England. It is uncertain what his intentions were, but after landing with a small retinue in Sussex he was met by Godwin, Earl of Wessex, who escorted him in apparently friendly fashion to Guildford. Having taken lodgings there, Alfred's men were attacked as they <b>slept</b> <b>and</b> killed, mutilated or enslaved by Godwin's followers, while the prince himself was blinded and imprisoned, dying shortly afterwards. This must have contributed to the antipathy between Godwin and Alfred's brother Edward the Confessor, who came to the throne in 1042, a hostility which helped bring about the Norman Conquest of England in 1066.|$|E

As he nears Baker, California, a highway patrolman pulls him over for speeding, and advises him to sleep at a nearby rest stop. Duke instead heads to a payphone and calls Gonzo, learning {{that he has a}} suite in his name at the Flamingo Las Vegas so he can cover a district attorney's convention on narcotics. Duke checks into his suite, only to be met by an LSD-tripping Gonzo, and a young girl by the name of Lucy he has brought with him. Gonzo explains that Lucy has come to Las Vegas to meet Barbra Streisand, and that he gave her LSD on the plane not realizing she had never taken it before. Sensing the trouble this could get them into, Duke convinces Gonzo to ditch Lucy in another hotel before her trip wears off.|$|E

25|$|Alexander Cameron Sim {{moved to}} Kobe in 1870, {{where he worked}} for the {{settlement}} druggist Llewellyn & Co. before establishing Sim & Co. on Lot 18. In addition to distributing Ramune and proposing the foundation of the KRAC, Sim was also known for leading the settlement's internal firefighting force, for which he held lookout from a fire lookout tower in Nishimachi Park near his home. He kept his firefighting clothes, helmet, and axe beside his pillow even when he <b>slept</b> <b>and</b> participated personally in almost every fire-fighting effort during his tenure. After the settlement was returned and the firefighting force incorporated into Kobe's, Sim was left a position as honorary advisor in the new structure and allowed to direct a team. Sim was also the vice chairman of the settlement's Municipal Council, and as the chairman was sick during the ceremony for the return of the settlement, Sim attended in his place and signed the associated documents.|$|E
500|$|In 1904 and 1908, the Ritz garden café {{was painted}} by the Swiss artist, Pierre-Georges Jeanniot. Proust wrote parts of Remembrance of Things Past here from around 1909. [...] The {{building}} was extended in 1910, and César Ritz died in 1918, succeeded by his son, Charles Ritz. [...] Queen Marie of Romania {{stayed at the}} Ritz Hotel with her two eldest daughters, Elisabeth (of Greece) and Maria (of Yugoslavia) in 1919 while campaigning for Greater Romania at the Paris Peace Conference. Many other prominent royal figures and heads of state <b>slept</b> <b>and</b> dined at the hotel over the years. Edward VII reportedly once got stuck in a too-narrow bathtub with his lover at the hotel. [...] August Escoffier died in 1935.

500|$|While his adjutants {{were trying}} to wake Frederick, his generals, most of whom had not <b>slept</b> <b>and</b> had kept their horses saddled and weapons ready, {{organized}} the Prussian resistance. Keith had anticipated an Austrian attack and organized a slashing counterattack on the Austrians holding the Prussian battery. Maurice von Anhalt-Dessau, another of Frederick's able generals, funneled the awakening troops to Keith. Combined, this action briefly retook the Prussian battery south of Hochkirch, {{but they could not}} hold it in the face of Austrian muskets. At 6:00, three more Prussian regiments rushed Hochkirch itself, while Prince Maurice continued directing stragglers and reinforcements into the counterattack. [...] The Prussians swept through the village, out the other side, and fell on the battery at bayonet point. By that point, though, most Prussian order and cohesion had been lost. The Austrians, supported by their appropriated Prussian guns, which had not been spiked, wrought havoc on the attackers. Keith was hit mid-body and knocked out of his saddle, dead as he fell.|$|E

500|$|On 4 January 1922, South Georgia was sighted, {{and late}} that morning Quest {{anchored}} at Grytviken. After visiting the whaling establishment ashore, Shackleton {{returned to the}} ship apparently refreshed. He told Frank Wild that they would celebrate their deferred Christmas the next day, and retired to his cabin to write his diary. [...] "The old smell of dead whale permeates everything", he wrote. [...] "It is a strange and curious place....A wonderful evening. In the darkening twilight I saw a lone star hover, gem like above the bay." [...] Later he <b>slept,</b> <b>and</b> was heard snoring by the surgeon McIlroy, who had just finished his watch-keeping duty. Shortly after 2a.m. {{on the morning of}} 5 January, Macklin, who had taken over the watch, was summoned to Shackleton's cabin. He found Shackleton complaining of back pains and severe facial neuralgia, and asking for a painkilling drug. In a brief discussion, Macklin told his leader that he had been overdoing things, and needed to lead a more regular life. Macklin records Shackleton as saying: [...] "You're always wanting me to give up things, what is it I ought to give up?" [...] Macklin replied [...] "Chiefly alcohol, Boss, I don't think it agrees with you." [...] Immediately afterwards Shackleton [...] "had a very severe paroxysm, during which he died".|$|E
500|$|The Danville Political Club, a debating {{society which}} existed between 1786 and 1790, {{frequently}} held its {{meetings at the}} tavern. Many members of this society {{went on to become}} prominent political leaders at the state and national levels. Eleven of the Club's thirty members would participate in {{at least one of the}} ten constitutional conventions that helped separate Kentucky from Virginia. Among the members were Kentucky's first Secretary of State (and future U.S. Senator from Louisiana), James Brown; its third governor, Christopher Greenup; chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, George Muter; federal judges Harry Innes, William McClung, and Samuel McDowell; Congressmen Willis Green, Stephen Ormsby, Thomas Speed, David Walker, and Matthew Walton; U.S. Senator John Brown; and Thomas Todd, a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The existence of the club was lost to history until Speed's grandson, Thomas Speed II, discovered extensive minutes of its meetings that his grandfather, the club secretary, had taken and stored in a desk drawer. The younger Speed later published these minutes with his own commentary about the club, in which he opined that [...] "Full and complete biographies of some of the members would present a history of Kentucky from the beginning of its settlement past the first quarter of the ensuing century." [...] One of the few extant references to the Club outside Speed's meeting minutes is an entry in the journal of a U.S. Army paymaster named Major Beatty; while staying overnight at Grayson's Tavern, Beatty recorded that he and his companions were [...] "very much disturbed by a Political Club which met in the next house where we <b>slept</b> <b>and</b> kept us awake till 12 or 1 o'clock." ...|$|E
