These minerals were used to create the black pigment that decorated the beautiful ceramic pottery of this culture, and came from two sources: 1) Iacobeni, <b>Suceava</b> <b>County,</b> Romania for the iron magnetite ore, and 2) Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Ukraine for the manganese Jacobsite ore, located in the farthest eastern periphery of the Cucuteni-Trypillia geographical region, along the Dnieper River.

25|$|Born in Bilca, <b>Suceava</b> <b>County,</b> {{a village}} located in Austrian-ruled Bukovina {{not far from}} Rădăuți, Brăileanu was the ninth of twelve siblings. His father Gheorghe (1839–1902) was the {{director}} of the local primary school for at least forty years. Gheorghe's father Ioan, born in 1807, had been a simple peasant, but two of his sons became teachers, and the third a Romanian Orthodox priest. Traian's mother, Maria (née Polonic) was the daughter of a shoemaker from Suceava, and married his father in 1865. The first serious tragedy in his life came when his sister Ilenuța died, leaving the entire family despondent. Another two beloved siblings died of diphtheria in late 1893, leaving him a mature individual at an early age. His mother predeceased his father, so that both parents had died {{by the time he was}} twenty. The young Traian was a voracious reader, his interests including classical literature, German literature, other European literatures in German translation, Romanian literature and Romanian history, including Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol's Istoria românilor. He was attached to his brother Constantin, who settled in the Romanian Old Kingdom, which he represented as consul at Bitola and Thessaloniki; an employee of the Romanian Foreign Ministry, his son was killed in action during World War I.|$|E

The data have been processed into the following indicators: cattle livestock, number of dairy cows, milk yield, milk production. During the analyzed period, cattle livestock has continuously decreased, so that in the year 2007 there are just 1, 440 thousand cows in Romania of which in the North Eastern part are raised about 25 %. Milk yield has increased from 2, 850 kg /cow in the year 1990 to 3, 980 kg/cow/year in the year 2007, but total milk production has decreased taking into account the reduced number of cows. As a conclusion, the North East region is traditionally suitable for cow rearing, due to its pastures and meadows, the important number of cow stock and possibilities to produce ecological milk...|$|R

He crossed the border into Moldavia, {{settling}} in Ipotești, {{near the town of}} Botoșani. He married Raluca Iurașcu, an heiress of an old aristocratic Moldavian family. In a Junimea register, Eminescu wrote down his birthday date as 22 December 1849, while in the documents Cernăuți Gymnasium, where Eminescu studied, his birthday date is 14 December 1849. Nevertheless, Titu Maiorescu, in his work Eminescu and His Poems (1889) quoted N. D. Giurescu's researches and adopted his conclusion regarding the date and place of Mihai Eminescu's birth, as being 15 January 1850, in Botoșani. This date resulted from several sources, amongst which there was a file of notes on christenings from the archives of the Uspenia (Domnească) Church of Botoșani; inside this file, the date of birth was [...] "15 January 1850" [...] and the date of christening was the 21st of the same month.

40|$|Assuming {{that the}} market is the {{component}} that validates the correctness of decisions on the fate and prospects of a phenomenon, tourism development strategy should be based on good knowledge and assessment of the market, on the requirement to achieve a balance between its two correlative categories, which are supply and demand. Bukovina is among the touristic destinations known and appreciated by tourists. However, the elaboration of a development strategy should emphasize those tourism sustaining forms that can generate a beneficial multiplier effect upon <b>Suceava</b> <b>County’s</b> economy. Promoting a mix between cultural - religious, rural, active, and mountain tourism tour, accessible to a diverse range of tourists, must be coupled with general and specific infrastructural consolidation. These elements will be able to create favourable conditions conductive to the development of touristic “focal points” or will favour the development of “circuit - type” touristic programs with international visibility overlapped to the Bukovina’s territory, without excluding the possibility of their interconnection with adjacent areas like Maramures, Neamt and Chernovtsy Oblast. Main tourism coordinates analysis in the <b>county</b> of <b>Suceava</b> - arrivals, overnight stays, average stay, capacity utilization index etc. - show insufficient concern from local authorities to this field, which argues the need to develop a realistic strategy to approach the issue of tourism development in a modern, complex vision, connected to the latest theoretical results.

To realize a production of 4500 kgof milk, starting from the active actual production, in the Bihor County will berequired 3. 42 generations, in the Hunedoara County 1. 4 generations and in Suceava 1. 56 generations.

During 1999 and 2009, these areas were considered tax havens, due to some facilities accorded by the Government and the EU (headage compensatory allowances*, tax deductions, non-refundable funds). Many had the opportunity to invest in those regions, but no positive effect was to be seen. Tulcea County (Danube Delta area), coal mine regions, rural areas and the North-East area (<b>Suceava</b> and Botosani <b>county)</b> are considered to be Romania’s less favoured areas. * The objective of these schemes is to provide a reasonable level of income for farmers where natural production conditions are least favourable so as to conserve the countryside by the prevention of further depopulation of rural areas.

To meet this need, the current study proposes three methods: the simple analysis of the positioning of modified areas within the regions of development, the determination of their density, and spatial interpolation by ordinary kriging based on total affected area per base administrative-territorial unit. Regardless of the method, the results are similar and suggest that land cover changes are more frequent in the southwest (counties Mehedinţi and Gorj), while land use changes predominate in the Oriental Carpathians (<b>counties</b> <b>Suceava,</b> Harghita,Covasna, Bacău and Neamţ).

40|$|Household waste {{generated}} is often uncolleted {{in rural areas}} causing various types of pollution like: air and water pollution, soil pollution and the aesthetic degradation of the landscape. The environmental legislation proposed by the European Union was transposed on the national legislation but the implementation process was difficult because of particular situations encountered in practice. Rudimentary infrastructure of waste management and limited access to waste collection services lead to uncontrolled household waste disposal. In this context, the geographical location of rural settlements influences the way of waste disposal either on river banks or open dumps placed on roadsides or forest areas with various environmental implications. Those, forest areas in the proximity of human settlements or recreation areas become vulnerable to waste pollution. Even if local authorities are obliged to provide waste collection facilities since July 16, 2009 the illegal dumping of waste in forests is still present. This situation is reflected by field observations from <b>Suceava</b> and Neamț <b>counties.</b> Usually forest areas affected by uncontrolled waste disposal are located in hilly regions or subcarpathian areas. The degradation of these areas is visible and this can have a negative influence {{not only on the}} environment but also on tourism activities...|$|R
