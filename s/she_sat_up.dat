[...] "She cried out suddenly, 'I'm dying! I'm dying!' She was coaxed to lie down again, but {{remained}} agitated. [...] "The child turned to me, and said anxiously, 'Send a telegram to mama.'" [...] Eagar promised it would be done. [...] "She added, 'immediately.' ... We continued to fan the feeble spark of life, but moment by moment it declined. She began to talk to her cousins, and seemed to imagine she was playing with them. She asked for little Anastasie and I brought the wee thing into the room. The dying eyes rested on her for a moment, and Anastasie said, 'Poor cousin Ella! Poor Princess Elizabeth!' I took the baby out of the room." [...] Doctors told Alexandra that the child's mother should be notified, but the telegram did not arrive until the following morning, when Elisabeth had already died. An autopsy following her death confirmed that she had died of virulent typhoid, although it was rumored she had eaten from a poisoned dish intended for the Tsar.|$|E
60|$|A {{few moments}} later <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up.</b> She was evidently {{becoming}} stronger.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in {{the chair}} and looked at him with quivering lips.|$|E
60|$|Part of {{the time}} it rained, and then <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> huddled <b>up</b> in the shawls and {{tarpaulins}} which the woman placed about her: then, when the sun came out, <b>she</b> still <b>sat</b> huddled <b>up,</b> closing her eyes against the glare.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wonder,' said Miss Peecher, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> making <b>up</b> her {{weekly report}} on a half-holiday afternoon, 'what they call Hexam's sister?' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{put forth}} his stick and touched her; {{and at that}} <b>she</b> awoke, <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> with a cry, and looked upon him wildly.|$|R
60|$|The {{woman was}} silent, but not convinced. Presently <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in bed.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in the chair. Julien {{had known}} well how to rouse her.|$|E
60|$|Again <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> {{and when}} she spoke there was no tremor in her voice.|$|E
60|$|But Evelyn did not move. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> looking <b>up</b> at {{him with}} her bright eager eyes, {{in the depths of}} which he thought he {{detected}} some disappointment, or dissatisfaction.|$|R
60|$|Presently, however, <b>she</b> recovered, and <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> with an {{extraordinary}} convulsive shudder.|$|R
60|$|Nicholas {{was alarmed}} and perplexed, but the {{disclosure}} {{was not long}} delayed. When <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> and by degrees made the stunning event known to him, he stood as if transfixed.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> {{straight}} {{on his knees}} and looked at him, afire with an idea.|$|E
60|$|The light wakened Betsy Bobbin. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> {{rubbed her}} eyes and stared across the water.|$|E
60|$|She lay a {{long time}} there, glad of her escape, and then <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> listening.|$|E
60|$|Although <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> so {{much later}} than usual the night before, Anne was dressed on Saturday morning {{in time to}} go to her mother's room for a little while before breakfast.|$|R
60|$|The Moth {{was sound}} asleep when the Gadfly blew his trumpet. <b>She</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> too late the night before, and, owing to having indulged this bad habit, had {{overslept}} herself the following morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pretty {{much what}} you foretold, sir," [...] {{answered}} Nat, trying to smile bravely {{as he took}} his place beside Ruth on the settle, where <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> making <b>up</b> cherry-colored breast-knots {{by the light of}} one candle.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> {{and faced}} him, her face flushed with excitement, her eyes {{flashing}} soft fires.|$|E
60|$|Doña Rita frankly {{stared at}} me—a most unusual {{expression}} {{for her to}} have. Suddenly <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
60|$|Surajah poured some into a cup, {{but with}} an effort <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> and pushed it from her.|$|E
60|$|In a {{while my}} mother came in. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> down, {{pleating}} <b>up</b> {{the hem of her}} black apron, and smoothing it out again.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> working <b>up</b> {{the scene}} which awaited them, the child just expiring, {{his mother in}} hysterical agonies, and she herself {{displaying}} all her energy and resources, perhaps saving Johnnie's life--at any rate, being her brother's stay and support when his wife gave way.|$|R
60|$|He had muttered {{the word}} half aloud and she {{suddenly}} opened her eyes. At first she seemed bewildered. Then <b>she</b> smiled and <b>sat</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> with a start, {{her eyes}} {{questioning}} his, the breath coming quickly through her parted lips.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> {{and looked}} at him. Her eyes began to shine, and the colour came into her cheeks.|$|E
60|$|Peter {{continued}} to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in bed, and was interested at once.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{husband was}} out, and <b>she</b> <b>sat,</b> propped <b>up</b> {{in a chair}} behind the board that served for a counter, still {{attending}} to the shop; and thus it was that her son beheld her when he stooped under the low doorway, with the one word, [...] "Mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suddenly <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> {{straight}} <b>up</b> {{with a sort}} of convulsive shudder, and at {{the same}} time--you may laugh if you like--the most horrible feeling came over me. I didn't see anything, but I just felt that there was something or someone in the room besides ourselves.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> {{for some}} hours the evening before, {{so that there}} was no fear of her not being strong enough to get up as she proposed; but how would it be when she left her room, and beheld all that she could not have realised? ...|$|R
60|$|They worked {{until the}} first gong for dinner rang. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in her chair with a happy little laugh.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> {{and reached}} for a book that {{was lying on the}} little table by the head of the sofa.|$|E
60|$|She {{showed no}} sign of disappointment. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> and looked into the fire, {{smoothing}} her hair mechanically with her hands.|$|E
6000|$|Her tear-washed mind became vaguely friendly. With an {{unconscious}} comfort it focussed {{down to the}} robin. <b>She</b> rolled over, <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> and imitated his friendly [...] "cheep." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> {{suddenly}} <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in her bed, her great, thick rope {{of brown}} hair falling over her white shoulders, and flung her arms about me, {{and burst into}} tears on my old breast. I petted and soothed her, and said not a word; and, after a while, she stopped crying; but <b>she</b> still <b>sat</b> with her head so that I couldn't see her face.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Upon my word,’ he thought, ‘I did {{not think}} the girl could be so pretty. And to think,’ he added, ‘that I am under {{obligation}} not to use one word of this!’ He put forth his stick and touched her; and at that <b>she</b> awoke, <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> with a cry, and looked upon him wildly.|$|R
