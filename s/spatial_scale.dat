5|$|Wind is {{the flow}} of gases on a large scale. On {{the surface of the}} Earth, wind {{consists}} of the bulk movement of air. In outer space, solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through space, while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by their <b>spatial</b> <b>scale,</b> their speed, the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. The strongest observed winds on a planet in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn. Winds have various aspects, an important one being its velocity (wind speed); another the density of the gas involved; another its energy content or wind energy.|$|E

40|$|Scaling {{aspects of}} river flow routing are studied by {{comparing}} two flow routing schemes, one {{designed for use}} in coupled general circulation models (GCMs) and operated at large <b>spatial</b> <b>scales</b> (350 km), and the other designed for use in typical hydrological applications at small <b>spatial</b> <b>scales</b> (25 km). The same runoff data are used as input into the two routing schemes, and comparisons are made between mean annual, mean monthly and daily streamflow simulated at four locations within the Mackenzie River Basin. The results suggest that {{for the purpose of}} realistically modelling monthly streamflow {{at the mouth of the}} rivers in GCMs, flow routing at large <b>spatial</b> <b>scales</b> gives similar results. However, the amplitude of the annual streamflow cycle is slightly but characteristically larger, when routing is performed at large <b>spatial</b> <b>scales.</b> Flow routing at large <b>spatial</b> <b>scales</b> also results in overestimation of high flows, while low flows are underestimated.

We can grasp some paddy-field farming techniques of the Middle Mumun (c. 850–550 BC), from the well-preserved wooden tools excavated from archaeological rice fields at the Majeon-ni Site. However, iron tools for paddy-field farming were not introduced until sometime after 200 BC.

Large groups of such particles are known to assemble themselves into thermodynamically stable, structurally well-defined arrays, quite reminiscent of one of the 7 crystal systems found in metallurgy and mineralogy (e.g. face-centered cubic, body-centered cubic, etc.).

25|$|Viruses within similar hosts, such as hosts that {{reside in}} the same {{geographic}} region, {{are expected to be}} more closely related genetically if transmission occurs more commonly between them. The phylogenies of measles and rabies virus (caricatured by figure 2A) illustrate viruses with strong spatial structure. These phylogenies stand in contrast to the phylogeny of human influenza, which does not appear to exhibit strong spatial structure over extended periods of time. Clustering of taxa, when it occurs, is not necessarily observed at all scales, and a population that appears structured at some scale may appear panmictic at another scale, for example at a smaller <b>spatial</b> <b>scale.</b> While spatial structure is the most commonly observed population structure in phylodynamic analyses, viruses may also have nonrandom admixture by attributes such as the age, race, and risk behavior. This is because viral transmission can preferentially occur between hosts sharing any of these attributes.|$|E

25|$|If a {{group of}} neurons engages in {{synchronized}} oscillatory activity, the neural ensemble can be mathematically represented as a single oscillator. Different neural ensembles are coupled through long-range connections and form a network of weakly coupled oscillators at the next <b>spatial</b> <b>scale.</b> Weakly coupled oscillators can generate a range of dynamics including oscillatory activity. Long-range connections between different brain structures, such as the thalamus and the cortex (see thalamocortical oscillation), involve time-delays due to the finite conduction velocity of axons. Because most connections are reciprocal, they form feed-back loops that support oscillatory activity. Oscillations recorded from multiple cortical areas can become synchronized to form large scale brain networks, whose dynamics and functional connectivity can be studied by means of spectral analysis and Granger causality measures. Coherent activity of large-scale brain activity may form dynamic links between brain areas required for the integration of distributed information.|$|E

Specifically, it is claimed that, above the ecosystem level, a landscape level exists which is generated and identifiable by high interaction intensity between ecosystems, a specific interaction frequency and, typically, a corresponding <b>spatial</b> <b>scale.</b> Landscape ecology is defined as ecology that focuses on the influence exerted by spatial and temporal patterns on the organisation of, and interaction among, functionally integrated multispecies ecosystems.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of the {{environmental}} correlates of species’ distributions is essential for understanding population dynamics, responses to environmental changes, biodiversity patterns, and the impacts of conservation plans. Here we examine how environment controls {{the distribution of the}} neotropical genus Montrichardia at regional and local <b>spatial</b> <b>scales</b> using species distribution models (SDMs) and logistic regression, respectively. Montrichardia is a genus of aquatic macrophytes with two species, Montrichardia linifera and Montrichardia arborescens, and is often an important component of flooded habitats. We find that for each species, altitude, precipitation and temperature of the driest month figure in the best performing SDMs as the most important factors controlling large-scale distributions, suggesting that the range limits of both species are climatically constrained by plant water-energy balance and cold intolerance. At small <b>spatial</b> <b>scales,</b> logistic regression models indicate the species partition types of aquatic habitat along local gradients of water pH, conductivity, and water transparency. In summary, a hierarchy of factors may control Montrichardia distribution from large to small <b>spatial</b> <b>scales.</b> While at large <b>spatial</b> <b>scales,</b> evolutionarily conserved climatic niches may control the range limits of the genus, at small <b>spatial</b> <b>scales</b> niche differentiation allows individual species to grow in environmentally distinct aquatic habitats...|$|R

2500|$|In spatial ecology, scale {{refers to}} the spatial extent of {{ecological}} processes and the spatial interpretation of the data. The response of an organism or a species to the environment is particular to a specific scale, and may respond differently at a larger or smaller scale. Choosing a scale that is appropriate to the ecological process in question {{is very important in}} accurately hypothesizing and determining the underlying cause. [...] Most often, ecological patterns are a result of multiple ecological processes, which often operate at more than one <b>spatial</b> <b>scale.</b> Through the use of such spatial statistical methods such as geostatistics and principal coordinate analysis of neighbor matrices (PCNM), one can identify spatial relationships between organisms and environmental variables at multiple scales.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} related {{theory is}} hierarchy theory, {{which refers to}} how systems of discrete functional elements operate when linked at two or more scales. [...] For example, a forested landscape might be hierarchically composed of drainage basins, which in turn are composed of local ecosystems, which are in turn composed of individual trees and gaps. [...] Recent theoretical developments in landscape ecology have emphasized the relationship between pattern and process, {{as well as the}} effect that changes in <b>spatial</b> <b>scale</b> has on the potential to extrapolate information across scales. [...] Several studies suggest that the landscape has critical thresholds at which ecological processes will show dramatic changes, such as the complete transformation of a landscape by an invasive species due to small changes in temperature characteristics which favor the invasive's habitat requirements.|$|E
2500|$|Nearly all {{materials}} {{could be}} seen as hierarchically structured, especially since the changes in <b>spatial</b> <b>scale</b> bring about different mechanisms of deformation and damage. However, in biological materials this hierarchical organization is inherent to the microstructure. [...] One of the first examples of this, in the history of structural biology, is the early X-ray scattering work on the hierarchical structure of hair and wool by Astbury and Woods. In bone, for example, collagen is the building block of the organic matrix — a triple helix with diameter of 1.5nm. These tropocollagen molecules are intercalated with the mineral phase (hydroxyapatite, a calcium phosphate) forming fibrils that curl into helicoids of alternating directions. These [...] "osteons" [...] are the basic building blocks of bones, with the volume fraction distribution between organic and mineral phase being about 60/40.|$|E
