40|$|Casting {{removable}} partial dentures (RPDs) without completely {{filling the}} sprue channels and generating casting buttons {{would result in}} saving metal and making more defect-free castings. This investigation tested whether a complete and sound RPD casting can be obtained when a minimal amount of metal is used, A factorial experimental design, three <b>spruing</b> methods, two metal feeding directions, and two different weights of metal were used to cast 60 Kennedy class II, modification 1 RPDs. The metal used to cast each framework was either enough {{to result in a}} full button or in no button. Visual and radiographic examinations and counting of defects were made by two independent operators who were unaware of the <b>spruing</b> method, feeding direction, or amount of metal used to make the framework. The completeness of the casting and the presence of porosities were evaluated for clasps, major connectors, and meshworks. The use of minimal metal to cast RPDs was equally as successful as using enough for a full button, provided that the appropriate <b>spruing</b> arrangement and metal feeding direction were chosen.

40|$|Abstract. Casting <b>sprue</b> is {{required}} to parameterize for suiting material processing and developing casting quality so as {{to find the best}} casting <b>sprue</b> for the corresponding material. In this work, parameterization for casting <b>sprue</b> for different materials is conducted using Visual LISP. The main procedures are like this in sequence: establishing dialog for the casting <b>sprue</b> parameters of variable materials, drawing programming, entering the shape parameters of one material into the dialog, directly outputting its model through CAD. Combining techniques of material casting, CAD and Visual LISP together offers following merits: (i) simplify repetitive <b>sprue</b> design among different materials and develop drawing efficiency by making certain CAD function automatic. (ii) develop <b>sprue</b> design efficiency among different materials by leaving many similar structures of different materials to a computer program. Introduce The casting component has drawn an increasing concern due to its low cost and flexible construction. The casting <b>sprues</b> of different materials have the features of similar structure, variable size and strict tolerance, and material property is a key factor for casting <b>sprue</b> design.

The first sprue design was a tree sprue design consisted of four wax formers, 3 mm in diameter each, going directly to four different spots on the major connector. The second sprue design was a circular sprue design. The circular feeder was made from a 3 mm diameter wax. The auxiliary sprues emanating from the circular feeder were six in number, 2 mm in diameter each, and were attached directly to the major connector. The circular feeder was attached to the sprue button by four formers, 3 mm in diameter each. The third sprue design was designated as the bali sprue design. The ball design consisted of four feeders, 3 mm in diameter each, as with the tree design except that a 5 mm ball reservoir was placed on each feeder, 5 mm away from the wax pattern. Five frameworks of the same dental cast were prepared using each sprue design. The results showed that the three sprue designs used in this study are suitabie for producing sound RPD frame castings. When the circular sprue design is used, allowances should be made to assure adequate meshwork thickness. King Saud Universit...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study of}} the action of molten gold alloy during the actual casting process. The action was {{recorded}} by high-speed photog-raphy through a silica window. An under-standing of the directional forces of the molten alloy is helpful for space location and orientation of the casting ring. During the last 50 years, gold casting has achieved a high degree of excellence, but it still must be considered an empirical pro-cedure. 1 - This is evident when two identi-cal patterns are cast under supposedly iden-tical conditions; one may be a dense high quality casting, but the other may be porous or actually miscast. Many theories exist about <b>spruing</b> and venting as a means of eliminating porosity and miscasting. These theories are based on the examination of the completed rough castings, a method that has not proven to be completely reliable. To place dental casting on a scientific basis, we should obtain a greater understanding of the problems involved with gold delivery and solidification during dental casting. The objective of this research was to ex-amine the actual processes of gold delivery and solidification. To accomplish this ob-jective, high-speed photographic techniques were used, which permitted direct observa-tion and analysis of gold flow during the casting process. Some of the photographic results then were verified by the use of microthermocouples to record the actual temperatures. This study was supported, in part, by an institu...|$|E
