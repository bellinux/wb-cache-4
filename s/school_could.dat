5|$|At the school, the {{fatalities}} {{resulted from}} {{the collapse of a}} concrete block wall. One hallway completely collapsed, trapping many students in the rubble of the hallway known as 3rd Hall. The tornado at the school was so strong that it tossed and mangled cars in the parking lot, flattened parts of the stadium and tore trees out of the ground. School buses were there for an early dismissal due to the storms at just after 1:00pm, but the tornado hit before the <b>school</b> <b>could</b> be dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Shaw's mother {{subsequently}} sued Edgehill College and {{the teacher}} leading the expedition for negligence. The judgement given on 28 June 2012 found that the teacher had given clear instructions that the group should not attempt to cross Walla Brook but should instead go round it. It further found that the intervention of a passerby, who suggested that the group could cross the brook, had meant that the <b>school</b> <b>could</b> not {{be held responsible for}} the accident. It said that the failure of two teachers to meet up with the group as planned was not incompetence. The judge therefore rejected the claim.|$|E
5|$|In Multani v. Marguerite-Bourgeoys (Commission scolaire) (2006), {{the issue}} was whether a ban {{in a public school}} on Sikh {{students}} carrying kirpans (ceremonial daggers) for religious purposes was justifiable. Justice Louise Charron, who delivered the Court's majority opinion, applied the Oakes test to section 2(a) of the Charter. She held that the <b>school</b> <b>could</b> not discharge its burden of proving that prohibiting the kirpan was a reasonable limit on the student's constitutional freedom of religion.|$|E

5|$|Maroon: The university's {{official}} color {{used to be}} magenta, {{one which}} was shared by Harvard University. Since it was confusing for the two schools to be wearing the same color during athletic competitions, the matter of which <b>school</b> <b>could</b> lay claim to magenta was to be settled {{through a series of}} baseball games. Fordham won the games, but Harvard reneged on its promise. Both schools continued to use the color until 1874, when the Fordham student government unanimously agreed to change to maroon. Maroon was chosen because it was not widely used at the time. Sometime later, Harvard stopped using magenta in favor of crimson.|$|E
5|$|Art Farmer {{was born}} {{an hour before}} his twin brother, on August 21, 1928, in Council Bluffs, Iowa, {{reportedly}} at 2201 Fourth Avenue. Their parents, James Arthur Farmer and Hazel Stewart Farmer, divorced when the boys were four, and their steelworker father {{was killed in a}} work accident not long after this. Art moved with his grandfather, grandmother, mother, brother and sister to Phoenix, Arizona when he was still four. He started to play the piano while in elementary school, then moved on to bass tuba and violin before settling on cornet and then trumpet at the age of thirteen. His family was musical: most of them played as a hobby, and one was a professional trombonist. Art's grandfather was a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. This influenced Farmer's first choice of instrument, as his mother played piano for the church choir. The bass tuba was for use in a marching band and was Farmer's instrument for a year, until a cornet became available. Phoenix schools were segregated, and no one at Farmer's <b>school</b> <b>could</b> provide useful music lessons. He taught himself to read music and practiced his new main instrument, the trumpet.|$|E
25|$|The school {{remained}} at Trench Hall until 1946. The property {{was much too}} small for the 140 pupils who moved there, but enrolment dropped after the Nazis banned Jewish emigration in 1941. Also, the <b>school</b> <b>could</b> no longer keep its chickens, pigs or bee hives. While the school was evacuated at Trench Hall, the buildings and grounds of Bunce Court were used by the military and were much changed and required restoration work before the <b>school</b> <b>could</b> return. Not until after the war was over, was the school finally able to return to Bunce Court in 1946.|$|E

25|$|Architect Bruce Jilk was {{commissioned}} {{to design the}} school and given strict budgetary parameters: the per-pupil costs to build and operate the <b>school</b> <b>could</b> not exceed those of other {{high schools in the}} district. The result: a 68,000 square foot (6,300 m²) building, completed for $5,420,000, or $80 per square foot ($860/m²).|$|E
25|$|Beneficial {{occupation}} – of some {{benefit to}} the occupier. It {{is not necessary to}} consider financial profit, as the test here is whether someone will pay rent for the property. For example, in R v School Board for London (1886), the board operating a <b>school</b> <b>could</b> take no profit; the court held that this did not prevent beneficial occupation.|$|E
50|$|A {{study by}} the London School of Economics found that banning mobile phones in <b>schools</b> <b>could</b> {{increase}} pupils' academic performance, providing benefits equal to one extra week of schooling per year.|$|R

25|$|LAHS {{was at this}} {{location}} on Fort Moore Hill until 1917, when the high school was moved again. Part of the site was later replaced by {{the headquarters of the}} LAUSD. Because of political and financial hardship caused by the construction of the nearby Belmont Learning Center, the LAUSD moved from the location in 2001 so that a new high <b>school</b> <b>could</b> be built on its location.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, to {{celebrate}} the centennial, the Board of Directors established the 5th school; an Anglo-Chinese School named Pui Ying College, with Mr Wong Wai Wah as the Principal. In the first year, the school operated {{on the campus of}} Baptist Lui Ming Choi Secondary School at Lek Yuen Estate. In September 1979, the <b>school</b> <b>could</b> at last move into the 24-classroom premises in Wo Che Estate. The school library was open since September 1982.|$|E
25|$|After Chevron Corporation {{announced}} it was selling its office complex in Bellaire in 2016, HISD officials considered the idea of buying the property so a new Bellaire High <b>School</b> <b>could</b> be built there. Instead HISD decided to rebuild Bellaire High on its current site. In 2017 HISD announced plans to demolish the Gordon Elementary School/former Mandarin Immersion Magnet School campus in Bellaire so Bellaire High School's baseball practice field could be relocated there, allowing HISD to easily rebuild the high school main campus.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the number}} of {{subjects}} offered was large, choices were limited as each <b>school</b> <b>could</b> offer only a few subjects on the list for budget constraints, restrictions on combinations of subjects and the actual time allowed to cover the large syllabus of different subjects. In addition, some of the subjects were unpopular. One could not tAle the A and AS of a subject at the same examination. Students could take a maximum of 7 AL and/or AS subjects in one examination, {{but only a few}} students actually took 7 subjects from 2004.|$|E
25|$|More was needed. The old Columbia <b>School</b> <b>could</b> {{no longer}} safely {{accommodate}} the student population. A magnificent new structure was planned. The design process was {{unique in that}} the faculty and {{all members of the}} staff participated by submitting sketches, drawn to scale, of the facilities necessary to satisfy their needs. In 1926 construction began on the present Columbia High School building. Work was completed in September 1927, in time for the fall term. So well designed was this building that two years later its floor plan was described and pictured in the Encyclopædia Britannica in an article describing ideal American schools.|$|E
25|$|Education Minister Simon Birmingham {{outlined}} the federal governments action {{in response to}} the Louden Review in a media statement. The Turnbull Liberal/National Coalition Government was quick to adopt changes to the program following the review. Some of the actions taken by the Turnbull Government were not recommended in the review. The imposed limits included changes to some materials, limiting access to secondary schools as some material was not easily understood by younger students, and requiring parent opt-ins. Federal President of the Australian Education Union Correna Haythorpe criticised the decision requiring parent body consent before a <b>school</b> <b>could</b> instigate the program saying that decision should be made by educators.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{most of the}} townships, Itsoseng use to {{have most}} {{recreational}} sports like Tennis, athletics, aerobics, Softball and soccer. These sports were played in schools and the <b>schools</b> <b>could</b> challenge each other {{under the auspices of}} Mmabana.|$|R
50|$|A {{large part}} of the site was {{previously}} occupied by Pixies Hill - a children's camp run by the National Camps Corporation. The old camp buildings were converted into the district's first school before permanent <b>schools</b> <b>could</b> be constructed.|$|R

25|$|Due to {{a decline}} in enrollment, HISD closed Douglass Elementary School in May 2005. In spring 2005 Douglass Elementary had 274 {{students}} and had faced a 26 percent decline in enrollment in a five-year period leading to 2005. After Hurricane Katrina struck in the fall of that year Douglass temporarily reopened to accommodate hurricane refugees. The HISD board voted 6-1 to lease Douglass to the KIPP program for one year, so the Katrina <b>school</b> <b>could</b> operate. KIPP opened NOW (New Orleans West) College Prep, a temporary K-8 school. In March 2006, HISD agreed to sell the Douglass Building to Yellowstone Academy. Yellowstone bid on the building for $1.9 million ($ when adjusted for inflation).|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} of state's school system—the first state-funded {{system in the}} nation—also began to be laid during Hendricks's administration. During his tenure as governor each township was granted land on which a public <b>school</b> <b>could</b> be established. The value of these improvements totaled over $1.25 million, making it the highest dollar item on the budget to that date. Construction of the State Seminary, later to become Indiana University, also began during his term. Hendricks also contributed personally to Hanover College. As the state's finances would not allow the large-scale improvements Hendricks envisioned, he focused efforts on creating critical routes and approved legislation that required state residents to spend allotted amounts of time helping to build the state roads. Existing roads and rivers were improved by clearing obstacles.|$|E
25|$|Missouri and Iowa State {{first met}} in 1896 and the {{regional}} rivalry was born. Before the 1959 match-up between the two schools, {{which took place in}} Ames, Iowa, field testing showed that the telephones the two schools used to communicate with their coaches in the coaches box were wired so that either <b>school</b> <b>could</b> hear what was happening on the other sideline. The problem was fixed before the game, but neither of the two coaches knew that. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company of Ames then decided to have a trophy made to commemorate the incident, and thus the Telephone Trophy was born. Missouri leads the rivalry 61–34–9 all-time. When Missouri left the Big 12 for the SEC the rivalry was essentially ended.|$|E
