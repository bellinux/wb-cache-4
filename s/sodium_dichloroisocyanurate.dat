Some indoor swimming pools in Emilia Romagna region (Northern Italy) were visited and water and environmental air samples were collected. <b>Sodium</b> hypochlorite or <b>dichloroisocyanurate</b> were involved in water disinfection treatments. THMs in water and air were evaluated by head-space gas chromatographic technique, whereas HAAs, bromate, chlorite, chlorate in water were detected by ion chromatography with mass spectrophotometry. THMs were always present in pool water (range: 27 - 98 μg/L) and in environmental air (range: 39 - 119 μg/m 3), with chloroform as the main by-product. Levels in air were persistent and higher above and around the pool than in the surroundings. Bromate was never found while among HAAs monochloro, dichloro, and trichloroacetic acids were measured in all water samples (range: 109 - 387 μg/L). Chlorite in pool water was rarely evidenced, whereas it was always present in water supplying the pool. Chlorate was present in source water and also in pool water samples showing unexpectedly high concentrations (range: 192 - 12, 537 μg/L), with an increase of about 50 times with respect to source water. THMs, as index of {{the total amount of}} volatile DBPs, represent an additional source of human exposure as present in water and air. Among nonvolatile DBPs, only HAAs and chlorate were detected, sometimes at very high levels. Chlorate, usually considered as a by-product when drinking water treatment is made by chlorine dioxide, seems associated with disinfection processes usually adopted for swimming pool water, such as <b>sodium</b> hypochlorite or <b>dichloroisocyanurate.</b> The origin and chemical reactions of nonvolatile DBPs deserve further evaluation to refine exposure for subjects attending indoor swimming pools...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>dichloroisocyanurate</b> is a {{chlorinated}} cleaner. It {{was used}} for swimming pool sanitation and for the sterilisation of linen. Not recently ago <b>sodium</b> <b>dichloroisocyanurate</b> has substituted hypochlorite for the sterilisation of infant feeding bottles and teats. <b>Sodium</b> <b>dichloroisocyanurate</b> is soluble in water; this condition causes the hydrolysis of <b>sodium</b> <b>dichloroisocyanurate</b> in hypochlorous acid, that is the active agent, isocyanurate and isocyanurate chlorine. These compounds form a chlorine protein that carry out microbicidal activity. In a toxicology study {{has been shown that}} no severe changes in the normal metabolic function occurred, furthermore <b>sodium</b> <b>dichloroisocyanurate</b> has not shown teratogenic effects at the concentration of 200 mg/kg. The antimicrobial activity of <b>sodium</b> <b>dichloroisocyanurate</b> was evaluated against Gram negative bacteria such as E. coli or Salmonella typhimurium and against some fungi. This study illustrates a rapid antimicrobial activity using concentrations. Our study concentrated on the antimicrobial activity of <b>sodium</b> <b>dichloroisocyanurate</b> in some experimental conditions. We tested 66 strains of fungi, 28 Gram positive bacteria and 29 Gram negative bacteria. We also evaluated the antimicrobial activity of <b>sodium</b> <b>dichloroisocyanurate</b> against protozoa such as Trichomonas vaginalis. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated in cultural conditions and non cultural conditions; in these experiments we observed similar action in both the commercial product and pure substance. In cultural conditions <b>sodium</b> <b>dichloroisocyanurate</b> shows a good activity against fungi and bacteria, moreover it can be observed that the serum didn't interfere with its activity. In a non cultural condition the Candida was killed rapidly by the <b>sodium</b> <b>dichloroisocyanurate</b> but this activity is influenced by the growth phase of the yeast. Against mycelial form such as Penicillium and Aspergillus the <b>sodium</b> <b>dichloroisocyanurate</b> needs a longer contact time than yeast form for its activity. It {{is interesting to note that}} well known bacteria, that are resistant to the common antimicrobial agents, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were inhibited by <b>sodium</b> <b>dichloroisocyanurate</b> in a rapid bactericidal action. Our data demonstrates that no significant adverse influence on the activity of <b>sodium</b> <b>dichloroisocyanurate</b> was shown by pH and by temperature even if in some experimental conditions increased activity was noticed at pH = 6. 6. The <b>sodium</b> <b>dichloroisocyanurate</b> has demonstrated good activity against Trichomonas vaginalis.

40|$|To {{simulate}} food contact surfaces with pits or cracks, {{stainless steel}} plates with grooves (depths between 0. 2 and 5 mm) were constructed. These plates were artificially contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes in clean conditions, with organic soiling, or after 14 days of biofilm formation after which inactivation of the pathogen by Suma Tab D 4 (<b>sodium</b> <b>dichloroisocyanurate,</b> 240 and 300 mg/liter), Suma Bac D 10 (quaternary ammonium compound, 740 mg/liter), and bacteriophage suspension (Listex P 100) was determined. Both chemical disinfectants performed well in suspension tests and in clean carrier tests according to the European standard with a reduction of more than 5 and 4 log units, respectively, of Listeria cells after 5 min of contact time. However, for the plates with grooves, the reduction could not meet the standard requirement, although a higher reduction of L. monocytogenes was observed in the shallow grooves compared with the deeper grooves. Furthermore, presence of food residues and biofilm reduced {{the effect of the}} disinfectants especially in the deep grooves, which was dependent on type of food substrate. Bacteriophages showed the best antimicrobial effect compared with the chemical disinfectants (<b>sodium</b> <b>dichloroisocyanurate</b> and quaternary ammonium compound) in most cases in the shallow grooves, but not in the deep grooves. The chlorine based disinfectants were usually less effective than quaternary ammonium compound. The results clearly demonstrate that surfaces with grooves influenced the antimicrobial effect of the chemical disinfectants and bacteriophages because the pathogen is protected in the deep grooves. The use of bacteriophages to inactivate pathogens on surfaces could be helpful in limited cases; however, use of large quantities in practice may be costly and phage-resistant strains may develop...|$|E

40|$|Background: There is {{evidence}} that household point-of-use (POU) water treatment products can reduce the enormous burden of water-borne illness. Nevertheless, adoption among the global poor is very low, and little evidence exists on why. Methods: We gave 600 households in poor communities in Dhaka, Bangladesh randomly-ordered two-month free trials of four water treatment products: dilute liquid chlorine (sodium hypochlorite solution, marketed locally as Water Guard), <b>sodium</b> <b>dichloroisocyanurate</b> tablets (branded as Aquatabs), a combined flocculant-disinfectant powdered mixture (the PUR Purifier of Water), and a silver-coated ceramic siphon filter.

We also measured drinking water’s contamination with E. coli (compared to 200 control households). Findings: Households reported highest usage of the filter, although no product had even 30 % usage. E. coli concentrations in stored drinking water were generally lowest when households had Water Guard. Households that self-reported product usage had large reductions in E. coli concentrations with any product as compared to controls.

The expected effectiveness from the studied formulations shows that the tested agents can be recommended for surface disinfection as stated in present guidelines and emphasize the importance and need to develop routine and novel programs to evaluate product utility...|$|E
40|$|Gray mold {{caused by}} Botrytis cinerea {{is one of}} the most {{important}} postharvest fungal pathogens of cut flowers. Here, gamma irradiation, an alternative for phytosanitary purposes, and <b>sodium</b> <b>dichloroisocyanurate</b> (NaDCC) were used to control B. cinerea in a cut chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.) cultivar, ‘Baekma’, one of the cultivars susceptible to B. cinerea. Spore germination and mycelium growth of B. cinerea were inhibited by gamma irradiation in an inversely dose-dependent manner. A dose of 4 kGy completely inhibited the mycelium growth of B. cinerea. A significant change in flower quality (physical properties) on chrysanthemum was shown from gamma irradiation at over 0. 2 kGy (p< 0. 05). Therefore, in this study, the integration of gamma ray (below 0. 2 kGy) and NaDCC, an eco-friendly form of chlorine, was investigated to control the disease with low dose of gamma irradiation dose. Interestingly, the gamma irradiated flowers showed more disease severity than the non-irradiated flowers. The combined treatment of gamma irradiation and NaDCC does not affect the severity of the fungal disease, whereas only 70 ppm of NaDCC treatment showed a significantly reduced severity. These results suggest that only chlorination treatment can be applied to control B. cinerea in cut chrysanthemum flowers. ...|$|E
40|$|The sweet {{whey powder}} was {{determined}} presence of cyanuric acid in amounts from 4 to 9 mg / kg, {{and the amount of}} melamine of less than 1 mg / kg. At the same time in plastic bags in which the whey powder was found packed in less than 5 mg / kg cyanuric acids and less than 2 mg / kg melamine. All analyzes were conducted Authorized European laboratories using standard methods. According to the findings, test results can be the migration of certain ingredients in the product packaging, indicating that cyanuric acid found in the product not originating from the packaging. Results of analysis for the presence of pesticides in the whey powder and pasteurized milk (since it is a minor metabolite melamine ciromazina) show that in both the quantity of product less than 0. 1 mg / kg. These results indicate that cyanuric acid not derived from melamine.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine whether the new disinfectant Aviclor (HidroAll do Brazil Ltda., Valinhos, São Paulo, Brazil), a formulation containing <b>sodium</b> <b>dichloroisocyanurate,</b> acetylsalicylic acid, sodium chloride, and a dye pigment, was effective in killing a group of selected pathogens obtained from chickens. The use of Aviclor completely eliminated several viruses, including infectious laryngotracheitis virus, infectious bronchitis virus, infectious bursal disease virus, and rotavirus, at disinfectant concentrations in the range of 0. 5 to 0. 77 g/L, with exposure times between 5 and 10 min. In addition, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis phage type 4, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus were killed after treatments with Aviclor concentrations ranging from 0. 67 g/L for 15 min to 0. 93 g/L for 20 min. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most sensitive to the product, and S. aureus was the most resistant to the disinfectant; the concentration required for eliminating the bacteria was 1. 067 g/L for 15 min. We conclude that because of the virucidal and bactericidal activities of Aviclor and the short effective exposure times, together with the low corrosive action and the absence of toxicity to birds and the environment, Aviclor is suitable as a disinfectant for poultry productio...|$|E
