Fibre fractionation studies showed that the fines fractions contained 8 to 13 times more residual lipophilic extractives than the whole pulps.

40|$|Waste from {{pulp and}} paper mills consist of sugar-rich {{fractions}} comprising hemicellulose derivatives and cellulose by-products. A complete characterisation of the waste streams is necessary to study the possibilities of an existing mill. In this work, four chromatographic methods {{have been developed to}} obtain the most suitable chromatographic method conditions for measuring woody feedstocks, lignocellulosic hydrolysates and cellulose <b>pulp</b> in <b>sulphite</b> <b>pulping</b> processes. The analysis of major and minor monosaccharides, aliphatic carboxylic acids and furfurals has been optimised. An important drawback of the spent liquors generated after <b>sulphite</b> <b>pulping</b> is their acidic nature, high viscosity and adhesive properties that interfere in the column lifetime. This work recommends both a CHO- 782 Pb column for the sugar analysis and an SH- 1011 resin-based cross-linked gel column to separate low-molecular-weight chain acids, alcohols and furfurals. Such columns resulted in a good separation with long lifetime, wide pH operating range and low fouling issues.

[...] cmartin@irnase. csic. esLignosulphonates {{are complex}} biopolymers which are {{recovered}} from the spent <b>sulphite</b> <b>pulping</b> liquids. In the production of wood <b>pulp</b> using a <b>sulphite</b> <b>pulping</b> process, the lignins are sulphonated so they become water soluble. Lignosulphonates are used as binders, dispersants, emulsifiers and sequestrants {{in a host of}} products such as gypsum board, animal feed pellets and micronutrient systems. The properties of lignosulphonates are strongly affected by their structure, and therefore whether they are produced from softwoods, hardwoods, or grasses. In this work, we are using analytical pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) in order to get information on the structure of lignosulphonates. Analytical pyrolysis is a rapid and highly sensitive technique for characterizing the chemical structure of lignin, allowing the analysis of small amounts of sample without prior manipulation and/or isolation. Characteristic features of lignins, including their composition in terms of p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) units can be established based upon analytical pyrolysis. Four different lignosulphonate samples (one from hardwood and three from softwoods) were selected for this study: # 261 (hardwood calcium lignosulphonate); # 264 (softwood lignosulphonic acid, ion-exchanged to H+); # 265 (softwood lignosulphonic acid, ion-exchanged to H+); # 266 (softwood lignosulphonic acid, ion-exchanged to H+). These samples were analyzed by Py-GC/MS in order to asses the suitability of this technique for their characterization. All the lignosulphonate samples released, upon Py-GC/MS, high amounts of low molecular weight sulphur compounds (sulphur dioxide, dimethyl sulphide, propylene sulphide, dimethyl disulphide, dimethyl trisulphide and methanesulphonic acid methyl ester) arising from the sulphonate group. Lignin-derived compounds with both guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) structures, characteristic of a hardwood lignin, as well as some amounts of carbohydrate-derived compounds, were identified in lignosulphonate # 261. However, only guaiacyl (G) lignin-derived compounds, characteristic of softwood lignins, were present in the rest of lignosulphonates (samples # 264, # 265, # 266). The presence of only guaiacol and vanillic acid methyl ester in the pyrolysate of the lignosulphonate sample # 266 seems to indicate that this sample is more oxidized than the rest.

40|$|The {{colouring}} {{matter is the}} name applied to a coloured material believed {{to be present in}} chemical wood pulps and regarded, by workers in the field, to be of considerable importance in the bleaching of these pulps. In the production of a good quality white pulp from wood, two main steps are involved, namely the "cooking" of the wood, and the bleaching of the raw pulp obtained. [ [...] . ] Of the two main types of chemical pulps used commercially, namely, (a) acid or <b>sulphite</b> <b>pulps,</b> (prepared by heating under pressure with acid bisulphite solutions), and (b) alkaline pulps (prepared by heating under pressure with aqueous alkalies), the latter present by far the greater problem {{from the point of view}} of bleaching. Kraft pulps are especially difficult to bleach to a permanent white colour. The final colour is almost always slightly yellowish despite the fact that the "chlorine consumption" of these pulps is much larger than with <b>sulphite</b> and soda <b>pulps.</b> At this point it may be advisable to define the terms kraft and sulphate, since the careless use of these terms often leads to confusion. Sulphate pulp is produced by any alkaline "cooking" process in which the alkali lost is replaced by the addition of sodium sulphate in the regeneration of the "spent-liquor". Kraft is a type of sulphate pulp which has been intentionally undercooked to obtain a pulp of high strength. [ [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|Knot rejects {{obtained}} from <b>pulp</b> screening after <b>sulphite</b> <b>pulping</b> {{are difficult to}} dewater, which makes landfilling expensive and burning inefficient. The rejects were found to contain up to 50 % cellulose, which is very susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis to glucose. Knot rejects were hydrolyzed at 20 % consistency in a laboratory peg mixer with cellulase enzyme. The thick slurry was liquefied within the first hour of mixing and resulted in a glucose concentration of over 100 g/L after 24 hours of reaction.

The laboratory results were confirmed at pilot scale with a mortar mixer (high consistency) or stirred tank reactor (medium consistency) at the 400 L and 6000 L scales, respectively. It was found that washing the knots with ammonia resulted in increased glucose conversion. Enzyme costs could be lowered by separating the enzyme from the hydrolyzed sugars by membrane ultrafiltration and recycling the enzyme to the subsequent batch of substrate.
