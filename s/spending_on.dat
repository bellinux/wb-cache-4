5|$|In the 2016 Honolulu mayoral {{elections}} {{the main}} three candidates again took opposing views on rail. Charles Djou, former mayor Peter Carlisle, and incumbent Kirk Caldwell all ran for mayor with the stated goal of finishing rail. However, Republican Djou ran on drastically cutting <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> rail by cutting funding on buying {{cars on the}} rail before its completion, and hiring mainland consultants. Kirk Caldwell also stated that <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> rail should be cut, but instead by shortening the rail to end at Middle Street. Carlisle was the only candidate in full support of funding the rail system and stated that rail {{has gone too far}} to be stopped. Kirk Caldwell won the election, and promptly went on to adopt Carlisle's position that rail should be completed.|$|E

5|$|Massachusetts and New Hampshire were on {{the front}} line of the war, yet the New England colonies {{suffered}} less economic damage than other areas.

5|$|Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election, {{which gave}} the party a {{majority}} in the Lok Sabha, the first time a single party had achieved this since 1984. Modi himself was elected to parliament from Varanasi. Since taking office, Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy, increased <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> infrastructure, and reduced <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy, and centralised power through the abolition of the planning commission. He has begun a high-profile sanitation campaign, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. Credited with engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda.|$|E
5|$|Moscow {{had built}} up a {{military}} that consumed as much as 25percent of the Soviet Union's gross national product {{at the expense of}} consumer goods and investment in civilian sectors. Soviet <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> the arms race and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated deep-seated structural problems in the Soviet system, which saw at least a decade of economic stagnation during the late Brezhnev years.|$|E

5|$|Robert E. Hall applied {{rational}} expectations to Friedman's permanent income hypothesis that people base {{the level of}} their current <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> their wealth and lifetime income rather than current income. Hall found that people will smooth their consumption over time and only alter their consumption patterns when their expectations about future income change. Both Hall's and Friedman's versions of the permanent income hypothesis challenged the Keynesian view that short-term stabilization policies like tax cuts can stimulate the economy. The permanent income view suggests that consumers base their <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> wealth, so a temporary boost in income would only produce a moderate increase in consumption. Empirical tests of Hall's hypothesis suggest it may understate boosts in consumption due to income increases; however, Hall's work helped to popularize Euler equation models of consumption.|$|E

In the 2009 provincial election they campaigned against the carbon tax which the governing BC Liberal Party had implemented the previous year.|$|E

5|$|Academic {{research}} {{increased at}} the turn of the 20th century, and as the Ministry of Works took control of the sites, government <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> these investigations began. Historians such as Sidney Toy and Charles Peers published work on the sites, and research continued under Arnold Taylor, who joined the Office of Works as an assistant inspector in 1935. Major academic reports were published in the 1950s, adding to the sites' reputation. Taylor was also instrumental in the successful opposition to road projects proposed in the 1970s which would have had a substantial impact on the appearance of the Conwy site. In the late 20th century, detailed reconstructions of the castles were painted by historical artists including Terry Ball, John Banbury and Ivan Lapper.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt at a}} school field trip, Edna Krabappel calls an {{emergency}} strike {{on behalf of the}} Teachers' Union of Springfield Elementary, to protest against Principal Skinner's miserly <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> the school. The school is closed and students cope in their own ways. The parents of Springfield attempt to act as substitute teachers until the strike is over but this is deemed unsuccessful. Eventually, the two sides are forced into talking and think of a resolution: using the school to house prisoners from the overcrowded prison system, thus generating money and returning the school to normal.|$|E
5|$|By 1285, Caernarfon's town {{walls were}} mostly complete. At {{the same time}} work {{continued}} on the castle. <b>Spending</b> <b>on</b> construction was negligible from 1289 and accounts end in 1292. EdwardI's campaign of castle-building in Wales cost £80,000 between 1277 and 1304, and £95,000 between 1277 and 1329; by 1292 £12,000 had been spent {{on the construction of}} Caernarfon's castleof which the southern facade was furthest alongand town walls. As the southern wall and town walls completed a defensive circuit around Caernarfon, the plan was to build the castle's northern facade last.|$|E

5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 12th century, Southampton Castle was valued more for its role in coastal defence and as a coastal base for {{operations}} on the continent than for its value in ensuring internal security. Following the threat of French invasion in the 1170s, Henry II invested modest additional resources in the castle, and in 1187 the wooden keep was converted into a stone shell-keep. John increased <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> the castle during his reign. Royal visits to Southampton were quite common, and additional royal accommodation, called the King's House, was built outside the castle.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the Commonwealth Prime Ministers in London shortly after taking office in 1957. He generated headlines by proposing that 15% of Canadian <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> US imports instead be spent on imports from the United Kingdom. Britain responded with an offer of a free trade agreement, which was rejected by the Canadians. As the Harold Macmillan government in the UK sought to enter the Common Market, Diefenbaker feared that Canadian exports to the UK would be threatened. He also believed that the mother country should place the Commonwealth first, and sought to discourage Britain's entry. The British were annoyed at Canadian interference. Britain's initial attempt to enter the Common Market was vetoed by French President Charles de Gaulle.|$|E

After a media exposé and criticism from health sector professionals, two more {{hospitals were}} built in the western and northern suburbs of Adelaide respectively. Playford's attitude to social welfare was also criticised. He said that it was up to charity, not the government, to support orphans and disadvantaged sectors of the community so that they could enjoy a better standard of living. <b>Spending</b> <b>on</b> social welfare lagged behind that in other states, and legislative reforms on this front were non-existent.|$|E
