25|$|Casual {{matchmaking}} allows players, alone, or in a {{party with}} invited friends, to be randomly matched against others. The game servers will attempt to match the gathered players in party via a dynamic queue with others based on general skill level, only broadening outside this <b>search</b> <b>range</b> if {{it takes a long}} time to find matching players. Blizzard works to adjust this matchmaking approach to making sure players will find matches of people with roughly equivalent skill level. For example, in June 2016, Blizzard removed the option for players to avoid specific opponents; the option was meant for players to be able ignore trolls, but instead found that highly skilled players were being put on these avoidance lists and were having difficulty finding games or would be matched with new and less-skilled players.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} improvement {{can be made}} with an index. In the example above, initial disk reads narrowed the <b>search</b> <b>range</b> by a factor of two. That can be improved substantially by creating an auxiliary index that contains the first record in each disk block (sometimes called a sparse index). This auxiliary index would be 1% {{of the size of the}} original database, but it can be searched more quickly. Finding an entry in the auxiliary index would tell us which block to search in the main database; after searching the auxiliary index, we would have to search only that one block of the main database—at a cost of one more disk read. The index would hold 10,000 entries, so it would take at most 14 comparisons. Like the main database, the last 6 or so comparisons in the aux index would be on the same disk block. The index could be searched in about 8 disk reads, and the desired record could be accessed in 9 disk reads.|$|E

2500|$|Realizing the {{necessity}} of testing and evaluating the B-36 Peacemaker's APG-3 radar tail turret system, Headquarters, United States Air Force, directed the 7th Bomb Wing to undertake testing. The APG-3 was a radar airborne gun sighting system that provided for aircraft detection and automatic fire control of the tail-turret guns, designed to detect and automatically track targets up to 5,000 yards in range on fighter-type aircraft. However, {{it was possible to}} extend that <b>search</b> <b>range</b> temporarily on fighters. After a particular target had been selected by the gunner-radar operator, the system automatically tracked the target within its angular limits in both range and direction. Also, the system automatically directed and pointed the gun turret in the correct firing position. The only mechanical function of the gunner was the activation of the firing mechanism when the target was in effective firing range. One B-36B, 44-92042, of the 26th Bomb Squadron, 11th Bomb Group, was modified for testing as the right gun on the APG-3 was removed and a 35mm Vitarama camera installed in lieu of the turret. The first mission was flown on 25 October 1949, over Eglin AFB Gunnery Range, at [...] Three passes were made on the tail position by two Lockheed F-80 Shooting Stars. Following those passes the APG-3 radar system failed. The malfunction of the radar system was due to low voltage transmitted to the modular and to an antenna tilt motor failure.|$|E

Our algorithm {{is based on}} the intuitions that reliably matched pixels need less regularization in the energy minimization and neighboring pixels should have similar disparity <b>search</b> <b>ranges</b> if their pixel values are similar. We propose a novel bi-labeling process to classify reliable and unreliable pixels that incorporate left-right consistency checks. We then propagate the reliable disparities into unreliable regions to form a complete disparity map and construct per-pixel <b>search</b> <b>ranges</b> based on the difference between the disparity map after propagation and the one computed from a winner-take-all method. Experimental results evaluated on the Middlebury stereo benchmark show our proposed algorithm is able to achieve 77 % average reduction rate while preserving satisfactory accuracy. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel method that {{estimates}} camera position and posture {{from a single}} image using a feature landmark database. Conventionally, several kinds of camera parameter estimation methods are proposed in which pre-constructed database is used to estimate the camera parameters.

Pushing {{the state of the}} art for the USSR, the original design, known as Mech, was supposed to draw heavily on technologies developed for the experimental Soyuz radar program led by NPO Istok. It was intended to have a great deal of commonality with the MiG-29's N019 Rubin radar. N001 has a 1.075m antenna diameter twist-cassegrain antenna. A pulse-doppler design operating in the 3 cm band utilising medium and high PRFs for optimum lookdown capability, the N001 has a <b>search</b> <b>range</b> of 80-100 km against a 3m m RCS target in a headon engagement, 140 km against a large bomber. It can track a 3m target at 65 km. In a pursuit engagement, <b>search</b> <b>range</b> for a 3m target falls to just 40 km. Azimuth limits are ±60. Initial units had a MTBF of only 5 hours, but later type is 100 hours; MTBF was eventually brought up to 200 hours.
