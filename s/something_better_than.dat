[...] Poole was convinced that he was that somebody; [...] "I wanted [...] a film that gay people could look at and say, 'I don't mind being gay - it's beautiful to see those people do what they're doing.'" [...] Having enlisted the help of his lover, Peter Fisk, and another man, Poole first shot a ten-minute segment entitled Bayside.|$|E
500|$|The early volumes, largely {{written by}} Leslie McFarlane, have been praised for their {{atmosphere}} and writing style, qualities often considered lacking in juvenile series books. McFarlane's writing {{is clear and}} filled with specific details, making his works superior to many other Stratemeyer series titles. Such, at least, was McFarlane's intention: [...] "It seemed to me the Hardy Boys deserved <b>something</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the slapdash treatment Dave Fearless had been getting... I opted for Quality." [...] The volumes not written by McFarlane or his wife were penned by John Button, who wrote the series from 1938 to 1942; this period is {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "Weird Period" [...] as the writing is full of inconsistencies and the Hardy Boys' adventures involve futuristic gadgetry and exotic locations.|$|E

[...] Recalled Esch in 2009, [...] "I was happy about my new creative freedom at that time and so I refused the concept of a fast reunion of the original KMFDM." [...] Konietzko said of the reformed band, [...] "Not only is it fun again, but it's devoid of all the personal confrontations due to egos and fractions that were once a part of the band," [...] but said, [...] "I really miss En Esch," [...] in 2003. KMFDM released its first album in three years, Attak, in March 2002. The album was on the Billboard Independent Albums Chart for four weeks, peaking at No.11.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{noted that}} the {{solution}} {{to some of the}} puzzles were unclear, further hindered by the planets' inhabitants, whose dialogue does not change when the planet's puzzle is completed. The tongue propulsion physics were said to be clumsy by StaceyG, who stated that, in conjunction with the gravity exerted by planets, it is more difficult to leave planets' surfaces than to navigate through space. Both Meer and StaceyG enjoyed the spacefaring aspect of the game, and Derek Yu of website TIGSource stated the controls [...] "sometimes felt brilliant, at other times felt unresponsive and awkward." [...] Patrick Dugan of Play This Thing saw potential in the tongue-swinging gameplay, noting that Aether appeared to be the first of a series. He suggested that more spatial elements, such as nebulae and black holes, would have made space flight more interesting. McMillen described Aether as [...] "just the prelude to a larger experience", while Yu suggested that a larger game with improved controls [...] "could be <b>something</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> great".|$|E
500|$|The second season, in 1945, {{featured}} two double-bills. The first {{consisted of}} Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2. Olivier played the warrior Hotspur {{in the first}} and the doddering Justice Shallow in the second. He received good notices, but by general consent the production belonged to Richardson as Falstaff. Agate wrote, [...] "He had everything the part wants – the exuberance, the mischief, the gusto.... Here is <b>something</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> virtuosity in character-acting – the spirit of the part shining through the actor." [...] As a teenager, the director Peter Hall saw the production; he said fifty years later, [...] "Of the performances I've seen in my life I'm gladdest I saw that." [...] In the second double bill it was Olivier who dominated, in the title roles of Oedipus Rex and The Critic. Richardson took the supporting role of Tiresias in the first, and the silent, cameo part of Lord Burleigh in the second. After the London season the company played both the double-bills and Uncle Vanya in a six-week season on Broadway.|$|E
500|$|According to {{contemporary}} sportswriter Grantland Rice, only two sports {{figures of the}} 1920s approached Ruth in popularity—boxer Jack Dempsey and racehorse Man o' War. One {{of the factors that}} contributed to Ruth's broad appeal was the uncertainty about his family and early life. Ruth appeared to exemplify the American success story, that even an uneducated, unsophisticated youth, without any family wealth or connections, can do <b>something</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> anyone else in the world. Montville noted that [...] "the fog [...] will make him forever accessible, universal. He will be the patron saint of American possibility." [...] Similarly, the fact that Ruth played in the pre-television era, when a relatively small portion of his fans had the opportunity to see him play allowed his legend to grow through word of mouth and the hyperbole of sports reporters. Reisler noted that recent sluggers who surpassed Ruth's 60-home run mark, such as Mark McGwire and Barry Bonds, generated much less excitement than when Ruth repeatedly broke the single-season home run record in the 1920s. Ruth dominated a relatively small sports world, while Americans of the present era have many sports available to watch.|$|E

Several reviewers identified Portal 2 as an early contender for [...] "Game of the Year", while others called {{it one of the}} best games of all time. Upon release, the game was widely considered {{to be as good as}} or better than the original. Eurogamer's Oli Welsh said that the game avoids the normal pitfalls that developers introduce in sequels, stating that [...] "Portal is perfect. Portal 2 is not. It's <b>something</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> that.". Gus Mastrapa of The A.V.

500|$|In 1995 Michael Sauter of Entertainment Weekly rated Never Say Never Again as {{the ninth}} best Bond film to that point, after 17 films had been released. Sauter thought the film [...] "is {{successful}} {{only as a}} portrait of an over-the-hill superhero." [...] He did admit, however, that [...] "even past his prime, Connery proves that nobody does it better". James Berardinelli, in his review of [...] Never Say Never Again, thinks the re-writing of the Thunderball story {{has led to a}} film which has [...] "a hokey, jokey feel, [...] is possibly the worst-written Bond script of all". Berardinelli concludes that [...] "it's a major disappointment that, having lured back the original 007, the film makers couldn't offer him <b>something</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> this drawn-out, hackneyed story." [...] Critic Danny Peary wrote that [...] "it was great to see Sean Connery return as James Bond after a dozen years". He also thought the supporting cast was good, saying that Klaus Maria Brandauer's Largo was [...] "neurotic, vulnerable... one of the most complex of Bond's foes" [...] and that Barbara Carrera and Kim Basinger [...] "make lasting impressions." [...] Peary also wrote that the [...] "film is exotic, well acted, and stylishly directed... It {{would be one of the}} best Bond films if the finale weren't disappointing. When will filmmakers realize that underwater fight scenes don't work because viewers usually can't tell the hero and villain apart and they know doubles are being used?" ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "C" [...] grade rating. She derided the show's need to place The X-Files logo in the teaser, but ultimately {{concluded that the}} episode was a [...] "decent [...] to recap". John Keegan from Critical Myth wrote that the episode [...] "ranks right in the mediocre range" [...] and awarded it a 5 out of 10. He noted, [...] "Overall, this episode did very little for me. I’m sure that the writing staff could {{have come up with}} <b>something</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> a bad sixth season plot when the idea of a humorous ninth season episode came to the table. Is there any hope {{that there might be a}} truly memorable episode where Doggett is allowed to be amused?" [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one-and-a-half stars out of five. The two argued that the entry was trying to [...] "be a 'Rain King' or a 'Terms of Endearment' and would like to recapture the sweet and charming feel of those early Season Six experiments." [...] However, they noted that because the show was in a different stage—Mulder and Scully were no longer the focus of the show's attention—that [...] "the same style falls flat on its face". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson complained that [...] "The X-Files is draining the trough of teenage angst again". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, felt that the teaser [...] "intrigues for a moment", but that the competing elements of [...] "quirky humour, body horror and teen love story quickly sink this disappointing outing." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of Burnand's biggest successes, both in Punch and on stage, was satire of the {{aesthetic}} movement. His play The Colonel (1881), based on The Serious Family, a play by Morris Barnett, ran for 550 performances and toured extensively. It made so much money for the actor-manager Edgar Bruce {{that he was able}} to build the Prince of Wales Theatre. Burnand rushed The Colonel into production to make sure that it opened several months before Gilbert and Sullivan's similarly themed comic opera, Patience, but Patience ran even longer than The Colonel. Oscar Wilde, no fan of Burnand's farces, wrote, in anticipation of seeing Patience: [...] "With Gilbert and Sullivan I am sure we will have <b>something</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the dull farce of The Colonel". For the Gaiety Theatre, Burnand wrote a burlesque of The Tempest entitled Ariel in October 1883, with music by Meyer Lutz, starring Nellie Farren and Arthur Williams. The Times complained of the [...] "flatness and insipidity" [...] of Burnand's text and of his vulgarising the original.
