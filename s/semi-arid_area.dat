25|$|Among {{those who}} believe that the term Gurjara was {{originally}} a tribal designation, there are disagreements over whether they were native Indians or foreigners. The proponents of the foreign origin theory point out that the Gurjara-Pratiharas suddenly emerged as a political power in north India around 6th century CE, shortly after the Huna invasion of that region. Critics of the foreign origin theory argue that there is no conclusive evidence of their foreign origin: they were well-assimilated in the Indian culture. Moreover, if they invaded Indian through the north-west, it is inexplicable why would they choose to settle in the <b>semi-arid</b> <b>area</b> of present-day Rajasthan, rather than the fertile Indo-Gangetic Plain.|$|E

40|$|<b>Semi-arid</b> <b>areas,</b> {{defined as}} those {{areas of the world}} where water is an {{important}} limitation for plant growth, have become the subject of increased interest due to the impacts of current global changes and sustainability of human lifestyles. While many ground-based reports of declining vegetation productivity have been published over the last decades, a number of recent publications have shown a nuanced and, for some regions, positive picture. With this background, the paper provides an analysis of trends in vegetation greenness of <b>semi-arid</b> <b>areas</b> using AVHRR GIMMS from 1981 to 2007. The vegetation index dataset is used as a proxy for vegetation productivity and trends are analyzed for characterization of changes in semi-arid vegetation greenness. Calculated vegetation trends are analyzed with gridded data on potential climatic constraints to plant growth to explore possible causes of the observed changes. An analysis of changes in the seasonal variation of vegetation greenness and climatic drivers is conducted for selected regions to further understand the causes of observed inter-annual vegetation changes in <b>semi-arid</b> <b>areas</b> across the globe. It is concluded that <b>semi-arid</b> <b>areas,</b> across the globe, on average experience an increase in greenness (0. 015 NDVI units over the period of analysis). Further it is observed that increases in greenness are found both in <b>semi-arid</b> <b>areas</b> where precipitation is the dominating limiting factor for plant production (0. 019 NDVI units) and in <b>semi-arid</b> <b>areas</b> where air temperature is the primarily growth constraint (0. 013 NDVI units). Finally, in the analysis of changes in the intra-annual variation of greenness it is found that seemingly similar increases in greenness over the study period may have widely different explanations. This implies that current generalizations, claiming that land degradation is ongoing in <b>semi-arid</b> <b>areas</b> worldwide, are not supported by the satellite based analysis of vegetation greenness.
