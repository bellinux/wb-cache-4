50|$|The railway {{companies}} became {{persuaded that}} the traditional bullhead forms of track needed revision, and after some experimentation a new flat bottom rail format was adopted. The British <b>Standard</b> <b>sections</b> were unsuitable and a new profile, a 109 lb/yard rail, was made the new standard. In 60 ft lengths, laid on steel baseplates on softwood sleepers, {{it was to be}} the universal standard. The fastenings were to be of a resilient steel type, and for secondary routes a 98 lb/yd rail was adopted. Regional variations still persisted, and hardwood sleepers and Mills clip fastenings were favoured on the Eastern Region, for example.|$|E

50|$|In October 1932, the British Air Ministry invited Vickers {{to tender}} for the {{recently}} issued Specification B.9/32, which sought a twin-engine medium daylight bomber. In response, Vickers conducted a design study, led by Chief Designer Rex Pierson Early on, Vickers' chief structures designer Barnes Wallis proposed {{the use of}} a geodesic airframe, inspired by his previous work on airships and the single-engined Wellesley light bomber. During structural testing performed at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, the proposed structure demonstrated not only the required strength factor of six, but reached 11 without any sign of failure, providing the geodesic airframe to possess a strength far in excess of normal levels. This strength allowed for the structure design to be further developed {{to reduce the size of}} individual members and adopt simplified <b>standard</b> <b>sections</b> of lighter construction.|$|E

5000|$|For {{jazz and}} pop {{compositions}} with several choruses, [...] "many jazz composers and arrangers" [...] use a format in which [...] "each successive verse/chorus {{part of the}} form is assigned successive letters of the alphabet" [...] combined with a measure number: for example, letter A for the first 8-bar phrase of the verse after the introduction, A9 for the next 8-bar phrase, A17, A25, then B, B9, B17, B25 for the chorus, etc., with the special rehearsal marking TAG for the tag ending. In jazz and pop music, the musicians frequently refer to the [...] "A section" [...] or the [...] "B section" [...] of a 32 bar song during rehearsals. In pop music, the music is commonly organized into <b>standard</b> <b>sections,</b> such as an intro, multiple verses and choruses (refrain), one or more bridges, a guitar solo (or other instrumental solos), and an outros. As such, a bandleader who wishes to start {{in the middle of}} a song will typically specify which part of this structure the band should start on (e.g., [...] "last four bars of the bridge, going into the guitar solo" [...] or [...] "last verse and go to the outro").|$|E

40|$|Major {{conclusions}} and {{recommendations of the}} National Commission on Air Quality on issues of health in the Clean Air Act are presented. The issues revolve mainly about the standard setting processes for ubiquitous pollutants, controlled through ambient air quality <b>standards</b> (<b>Section</b> 109), and for hazardous pollutants controlled through emission <b>standards</b> (<b>Section</b> 112). The conceptual difficulties inherent in the terms "adequate margin of safety" (Section 109) and "ample margin of safety" (Section 112) are discussed. The Clean Air Science Advisory Committee is widely viewed as having a salutary effect on standard setting. The need for maintaining strong research capabilities within the Environmental Protection Agency that are reasonably buffered against sudden disruptive events is emphasized. Mechanisms for achieving this goal through special congressional appropriations are considered...|$|R
