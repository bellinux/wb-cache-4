60|$|It {{was just}} as the Injins had got fairly on the lawn that we heard the {{clattering}} of hoofs, and every eye was turned in the direction whence the sound proceeded. This was {{on the side of}} the ravine, and to me it seemed from the first that some one was approaching us through that dell. So it proved, truly; for soon Opportunity came galloping up the path, and appeared in sight. She did not check her horse until under the tree, where she alighted, by a <b>single</b> bound, and <b>hitching</b> the animal to a hook in the tree, she moved swiftly toward the house. My sister Patt advanced to the steps of the piazza to receive this unexpected guest, and I was just behind her to make my bow. But the salutations of Opportunity were hasty and far from being very composed. She glanced around her, ascertained the precise condition of her brother--and, taking my arm, she led me into the library with very little, or, indeed, with no ceremony; for, to give this young woman her due, she was a person of great energy when there was anything serious to be done. The only sign of deviating, in the slightest degree, from the object in view, was pausing, one instant, in passing, to make her compliments to my grandmother.|$|R
60|$|So well were Madame Reynier's plans {{arranged}} {{that the}} boys passed from Madrid to the frontier without a <b>single</b> <b>hitch</b> or unpleasantness. Tom was soberly attired {{as a student at}} the university, Peter was muffled up to the eyes as a timid young novice, going from school to enter a convent, of which his aunt was lady superior, at Ciudad Rodrigo. The colonel, and, following his example, the officers of the regiment were polite and civil. The marches were of easy length, the mules stout and smooth-going, with well-filled traveling sacks. The weather was delightful, and the boys enjoyed the fortnight's march exceedingly. Upon the road they learned that Massena had laid siege to Ciudad Rodrigo, and that the 16th {{was on its way to}} join the besieging army.|$|E

'Every morning Neighbour Boney would muster his {{multitude}} of {{soldiers on the}} beach, draw 'em up in line, practise 'em in the manoeuvre of embarking, horses and all, till {{they could do it}} without a <b>single</b> <b>hitch.</b> My father drove a flock of ewes up into Sussex that year, and as he went along the drover's track over the high downs thereabout he could see this drilling actually going on--the accoutrements of the rank and file glittering in the sun like silver. It was thought and always said by my uncle Job, sergeant of foot (who used to know all about these matters), that Bonaparte meant to cross with oars on a calm night. The grand query with us was, Where would my gentleman land? Many of the common people thought it would be at Dover; others, who knew how unlikely it was that any skilful general would make a business of landing just where he was expected, said he'd go either east into the River Thames, or west'ard to some convenient place, most likely one of the little bays inside the Isle of Portland, between the Beal and St. Alban's Head--and for choice the three-quarter-round Cove, screened from every mortal eye, that seemed made o' purpose, out by where we lived, and which I've climmed up with two tubs of brandy across my shoulders on scores o' dark nights in my younger days. Some had heard that a part o' the French fleet would sail right round Scotland, and come up the Channel to a suitable haven. However, there was much doubt upon the matter; and no wonder, for after- years proved that Bonaparte himself could hardly make up his mind upon that great and very particular point, where to land. His uncertainty came about in this wise, that he could get no news as to where and how our troops lay in waiting, and that his knowledge of possible places where flat-bottomed boats might be quietly run ashore, and the men they brought marshalled in order, was dim to the last degree. Being flat-bottomed, they didn't require a harbour for unshipping their cargo of men, but a good shelving beach away from sight, and with a fair open road toward London. How the question posed that great Corsican tyrant (as we used to call him), what pains he took to settle it, and, above all, what a risk he ran on one particular night in trying to do so, were known only to one man here and there; and certainly to no maker of newspapers or printer of books, or my account o't would not have had so many heads shaken over it as it has by gentry who only believe what they see in printed lines.|$|E

The half knot is a binding knot, being the first movement of the reef or square knot. It is tied with two ends around an object and is used when reefing, furling, and tying up parcels, shoestrings, and the like.48.

30|$|In contrast, Ad-hoc Hitch Hiker, {{takes more}} time to {{configure}} a route since it uses data aggregation overlay itself to flood route discovery messages. For the smart building application, in the worst case, Ad-hoc Hitch Hiker requires 65 s to configure a single low priority binding. Each additional hop that must be configured adds 30 s to the configuration time, and the complete smart building app takes {{less than an hour}} to configure. However, Ad-hoc Hitch Hiker generates only two transmissions per Hitch Hiker binding, which costs 23 mJ â€“ significantly less than infrastructure mode. Message Transmission Enqueueing, dequeueing and encapsulating a <b>single</b> <b>Hitch</b> Hiker packet within a host frame requires on average of 12.27 mJ, while a standard frame transmission using CX-MAC requires 21.41 mJ, a saving of 57.4 % compared to standard transmission.|$|E
