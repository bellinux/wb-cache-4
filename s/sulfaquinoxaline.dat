The presence of both substances was monitored by UV absorption detection at 271 nm. The retention times of sodium trimethoprim phenylpropanol disulphonate and sodium <b>sulfaquinoxaline</b> were 3. 2 and 16. 0 min, respectively. The performance of the developed method was tested.

40|$|<b>SULFAQUINOXALINE,</b> [N 1 —(2 quin-oxalinyl) sulfanilamide] was {{reported}} by Furman and Stratton (1963) to be ef-fective in controlling infestations of north-ern fowl mites, Ornithonyssus sylviarum (Canestrini and Fanzago). Control was ob-tained by using feed containing 0. 033 % of the drug on a continuous basis over a 5 week period. This approach to poultry ecto-parasite control is well suited for applica-tion against a pest such as the northern fowl mite, which frequently spends its entire life on the bird. If it does leave its host it must find another for a blood meal rather quickly. Kirkwood (1963) found that all northern fowl mites died within three weeks when deprived of a host. Ott (1961), in reviewing the literature on residues of coccidiostats in poultry tissues, {{pointed out that there}} is an appreciable concentration of <b>sulfaquinoxaline</b> in the blood of poultry for one to three days after withdrawal of the material from the feed. The concentration of <b>sulfaquinoxaline</b> in the blood and its persistence were corre-lated with concentrations in the feed. This raises the question as to whether intermit-tent feeding of practical levels of sulfa-quinoxaline to poultry would serve to con-trol northern fowl mite infestations.

The mortality due to coc-cidiosis of non-medicated controls was 17. 43 percent. Singsen et al. (1948) found 0. 01 or 0. 02 percent <b>sulfaquinoxaline</b> in the feed did not reduce the growth of either male or female chicks up to eight weeks of age. The inclusion of 0. 03 per-cent <b>sulfaquinoxaline</b> in the diet definitely retarded the growth of female chicks. Bletner et al. (1953) reported sulfaquin-oxaline fed continuously for four weeks at levels of 0. 00625 and 0. 0125 percent did not affect either growth or feed utilization. A level of 0. 05 percent fed continuously gave somewhat inconsistent results indi-cating that continuous feeding at this level may be slightly toxic in certain ra-tions.

40|$|International audienceRATIONALE Sulfonamides such as <b>sulfaquinoxaline</b> (SQX) {{are among}} the most {{important}} antibiotic families due to their extensive use in veterinary medicine. The prediction of their fate under solar irradiation through the identification of the generated metabolites is required. However, unambiguous structural characterizations often remain a challenge particularly when several isomers could match with the same MS 2 data. METHODS Liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-Q-TOFMS) in the positive ion mode, leading to the formation of the protonated forms of the studied compounds, [M+H+] ions, was employed. Collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (CID-MS/MS) of the protonated molecules was carried out, and the effect of the collision energy as well as the elemental compositions of the product ions were used to propose chemical structures. Validation of the hypothesized structures was performed by the calculation of key fragmentation pathway energies using density functional theory (DFT) calculations (B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G (d,p)). RESULTS The photoproducts were identified as 2 -aminoquinoxaline, SQX isomers, 2 -(N-parabenzoquinoneimine) quinoxaline and isomers resulting from SO 2 extrusion. The direct fragmentations of [SQX+H]+ and its protonated isomers mostly occurred through the loss of 2 -aminoquinoxaline and/or the 4 -sulfoaniline radical ion, while their rearrangements involved the migration of H and/or O atoms. For the desulfonated byproducts in their protonated forms, the main neutral losses were of the quinoxaline radical, aminoquinoxaline and NH 3. The fragmentation of the protonated 2 -aminoquinoxaline mainly involved the elimination of NH 3 and HCN. CONCLUSIONS LC/ESI-Q-TOFMS and DFT calculations {{have been shown to be}} useful and complementary methods for the identification of unknown isomeric compounds and the elucidation of fragmentation patterns, in the case of the <b>sulfaquinoxaline</b> veterinary antibioti...|$|E

Six antibiotics were tested parenterally against experimental PA infection in another series of experiments. A single dose of an antibiotic was injected subcutaneously 5 to 6 hr after infection except in one experiment in which treatment was delayed until 24 hr after infection. When given 5 to 6 hr after infection, lincomycin-spectinomycin, penicillin-streptomycin, penicillin, oxytetra-cycline, and spectinomycin significantly reduced mortality. Gentamicin tested under the same conditions was ineffective. Drugs injected 24 hr after infection were not effective...|$|E
40|$|NUMEROUS sulfa {{drugs have}} been found {{valuable}} in the prevention and treatment of coccidiosis in poultry. Also various methods of using these drugs have been recommended. It is the belief of the authors that {{the inclusion of the}} medication in the feed continuously over a sufficient period of time to allow immunity to develop from natural expos-ure would be the safest and most eco-nomical method for controlling coccidiosis. This procedure would call for controlled infection rather than complete prevention of infection in order that the desired immunity might be established. Work at this station (Delaplane et al. 1947, and Grumbles el al. 1947) has shown that <b>sulfaquinoxaline</b> is effective against both cecal and intestinal coccidiosis. In these experiments 0. 05 percent sulfa-quinoxaline, fed in mash intermittently, and 0. 033 and 0. 0125 percent, fed con-tinuously in mash, gave good results. These studies also have shown that sulfa-quinoxaline used thus did not prevent the development of resistance to Eimeria tenella and Eimeria necatrix.

40|$|ABSTRACT Frequently, {{publications}} {{pertaining to}} waterfowl state that medicated feeds {{should not be}} fed to ducklings and goslings. In some localities, producers and hobbyists who raise {{a small number of}} ducklings and goslings can purchase only medicated chick, turkey, or gamebird starter and grower feeds. Because of the lack of documented information on this subject and the numer-ous requests for advice on this matter, anticoccidial drugs, zoalene, <b>sulfaquinoxaline,</b> and ampro-lium, were mixed in mash feed and fed to Khaki Campbell male ducklings to 4 weeks of age. No significant differences in mean body weight, mortality, and anatomical development were observed among the treatments. Medicated commercial crumble turkey and chick starter feeds produced significantly better feed conversion than the mash medicated or nonmedicated feeds. These differences can be attributed to greater feed spillage with the mash feed. Some ducklings in all treatments showed unsteadiness of gait and shaky legs. These conditions disappeared when the ducklings were moved from the battery brooder to an outside pen. Zoalene, sulfaquinoxaline,and amprolium used at the recommended levels for chickens and turkeys did not cause any leg or anatomical problems in ducklings. (Key words: anticoccidial drugs, duckling...|$|E
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of salinomycin poisoning in rabbits is described. At least 27 out of 2, 000 rabbits reared {{on a farm}} died after the coccidiostatic drug <b>sulfaquinoxaline</b> was substituted by salinomycin in the feed. An average of 26. 9 ppm salinomycin was detected in the ration given to the rabbits. Clinical signs included anorexia, apathy and bradykinesia, which progressed to incoordination and recumbency. Gross lesions consisted of pale areas in the skeletal muscles. The histopathological findings showed severe necrotic degenerative myopathy in association with infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages. One rabbit exhibited similar alterations in the myocardium. Mineralization was observed in the affected skeletal muscles in some cases. In order to verify if the poisoning was due to salinomycin, 20 rabbits were divided into five groups and a ration containing the drug at doses of 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 ppm was given. The administration of doses higher than 50 ppm resulted in manifestation of the clinical signs seen in the {{outbreak of}} poisoning. It was concluded, that probably an error related to the mixture of salinomycin in the feed {{was the cause of}} deaths in the spontaneous outbreak of poisoning on the rabbit farm...|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{establish}} {{a method for}} determination of 22 sulfonamides in pork, including sulfabenzamide, sulfacetamide, sulfachloropyridazine, sulfadiazine, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamethazine, sulfamera-zinesulfadoxine, sulfamonomethoxine, sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfamethoxydiazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethizole, sulfamoxole, sulfaphenazole, sulfapyridine, <b>sulfaquinoxaline,</b> sulfathiazole, sulfisoxazole, sulfaguanidine, trimethoprim and sulfisomidine, with matrix solid phase dispersion and high pressure liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. Methods Pork samples were mixed and grinded with solid-phase sorbent (Florisil), then put in a glass mortar. The mixture was packed as a solid phase extraction cartridge and eluted with 15 mL 1 % acetic acid dichloromethane:ethyl acetate(1 : 3, v/v). The eluted materials were collected and evaporated to dry by nitrogen gas. The residues were dissolved in 1 mL acetonitrile: 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate (15 : 85, v/v) and 1 mL n-hexane. After centrifugation, the lower solution was gone through a 0. 22 μm filter membrane and then separated by Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C 18 column (2. 1 mm× 150 mm, 2. 7 μm), after that it was determined by high resolution mass spectrometry. Results The linear range of 22 sulfonamides were 10 ~ 100 μg/kg, r> 0. 99. The recoveries of sulfamethizole, trimethoprim and sulfaguanidine were below 40 %, the others were above 60 %. The limits of quantitation were 5 ~ 10 μg/kg. Conclusion The advantages of this method are fast, efficient, less organic reagent and low cost. It is suitable for the determination of sulfonamides residues in pork...|$|E
