50|$|A {{spectrum}} analyzer {{is a standard}} instrument used for RF sweep. It includes an electronically tunable receiver and a display. The display presents measured power (y axis) vs frequency (x axis).The power <b>spectrum</b> <b>display</b> is a two-dimensional display of measured power vs. frequency. The power may be either in linear units, or logarithmic units (dBm). Usually the logarithmic display is more useful, because it presents a larger dynamic range with better detail at each value. An RF sweep relates to a receiver which changes its frequency of operation continuously from a minimum frequency to a maximum (or from maximum to minimum). Usually the sweep is performed at a fixed, controllable rate, for example 5 MHz/sec.|$|E
50|$|Speech mapping (also {{known as}} output-based measures) {{involves}} testing with a speech or speech-like signal. The hearing aid is adjusted {{so that the}} speech is amplified to the approximate middle of the patient's residual auditory area (the amplitude range between the patient's hearing threshold and upper limit of comfort) while observing a real-time <b>spectrum</b> <b>display</b> of the speech in the patient's ear canal. Many multi-channel hearing aids allow each frequency channel to be adjusted separately. The aim {{is to find a}} good compromise between intelligibility and loudness discomfort. This approach to hearing aid testing is implemented in most current real ear systems {{and there has been a}} significant increase in audiologists selecting to verify using the output method. Using a real speech signal to test a hearing aid has the advantage that features that may need to be disabled in other test approaches can be left active, and the effects of these features in normal use are included in the test.|$|E

40|$|Recently the {{statistical}} characterizations of financial markets based on physics concepts and methods attract considerable attentions. We used two possible procedures of analyzing multifractal properties {{of a time}} series.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a generalized ensemble of nonhermitian matrices interpolating between the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble, the Ginibre ensemble and the Poisson ensemble. The joint eigenvalue distribution {{of this model}} is obtained {{by means of an}} extension of the Itzykson-Zuber formula to general complex matrices. Its correlation functions are studied both in the case of weak nonhermiticity {{and in the case of}} strong nonhermiticity. In the weak nonhermiticity limit we show that the spectral correlations in the bulk of the <b>spectrum</b> <b>display</b> critical statistics: the asymptotic linear behavior of the number variance is already approached for energy differences of the order of the eigenvalue spacing. To lowest order, its slope does not depend on the degree of nonhermiticity. Close the edge, the spectral correlations are similar to the Hermitian case. In the strong nonhermiticity limit the crossover behavior from the Ginibre ensemble to the Poisson ensemble first appears close to the surface of the spectrum. Our model may be relevant for the description of the spectral correlations of an open disordered system close to an Anderson transition. Comment: 25 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} use of colour Doppler imaging (CDI) for the {{measurement}} of maximum and mean tendon velocity. Recent studies howed that CDI, normally used for blood flow examinations, {{can be used for}} the imaging of tendons at the hand and wrist l'Cgion. Although other modalities are available for imaging of the musculo-skeletal system, in vivo measurements of the veloc-ity of tendon excursion are not possible. Methods: The flexor pollicis longus (FPL) tendon of 16 healthy volunteers was measured bilaterally at two levels (wrist and thenar). A splint from the fingers along the proximal lower arm was applied. The thumb was fixed to the splint from the first phalanx to allow flexion of the interphalangeal (IP) joint only. Pulsed CDI was used for the measurements. The maximum and mean velocities of the FPL tendon were measured at <b>spectrum</b> <b>display</b> mode during continuous voluntary contractions. At least 10 sequential Doppler peaks (era/s) were recorded at every trial. The measurements were repeated three times.

40|$|Working {{memory is}} a {{temporary}} storage system under attentional control. It is believed to {{play a central role}} in online processing of complex cognitive information and may also play a role in social cognition and interpersonal interactions. Adolescents with a disorder on the autism <b>spectrum</b> <b>display</b> problems in precisely these domains. Social impairments, communication difficulties, and repetitive interests and activities are core domains of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and executive function problems are often seen throughout the spectrum. As the main cognitive theories of ASD, including the theory of mind deficit hypotheses, weak central coherence account, and the executive dysfunction theory, still fail to explain the broad spectrum of symptoms, a new perspective on the etiology of ASD is needed. Deficits in working memory are central to many theories of psychopathology, and are generally linked to frontal-lobe dysfunction. This article will review neuropsychological and (functional) brain imaging studies on working memory in adolescents with ASD. Although still disputed, it is concluded that within the working memory system specific problems of spatial working memory are often seen in adolescents with ASD. These problems increase when information is more complex and greater demands on working memory are made. Neuroimaging studies indicate a more global working memory processing or connectivity deficiency, rather than a focused deficit in the prefrontal cortex. More research is needed to relate these working memory difficulties and neuroimaging results in ASD to the behavioral difficulties as seen in individuals with a disorder on the autism spectru...|$|E
40|$|Cross {{sections}} of air-broadened NO_ 2 in the 415 − 525 nm region are reported. These are retrieved from 21 absorption spectra recorded at 0. 060 cm^(- 1) resolution with the McMath−Pierce Fourier Transform Spectrometer located on Kitt Peak in Arizona. The measurements are obtained for pressures (1 − 760 Torr) and temperatures (220 − 298 K) that {{are representative of}} typical tropospheric and stratospheric conditions. Two sigma uncertainty (95 % confidence interval ≈ 2 σ_(mean)) for the absolute absorption cross sections is below ± 7 % over the reported wavelength range. The average integrated intensity of all our data is 〈σ〉_(400 - 500 nm) = 4. 53 × 10 ^(- 17) cm^ 2 nm, which is within 0. 2 % of the averaged value from the recent literature. The wavelength (referred to vacuum) accuracy is 0. 011 cm^(- 1) (2. 8 × 10 ^(- 4) nm at 500 nm) and precision is 0. 0022 cm^(- 1) throughout the investigated wavelength range.
