40|$|Purpose: Retirees in {{traditional}} pension plans must generally choose between single life annuities, which provide regular payments until death, and joint and <b>survivor</b> <b>annuities,</b> which pay less each month but {{continue to make}} payments to the spouse {{after the death of}} the retired worker. This article examines the payout decision and measures the share of married retirees with pension <b>annuities</b> who forego <b>survivor</b> protec-tion. Design and Methods: The analysis consists of aprobitmodel of thepensionpayout decision, basedon data from the 1992 – 2000 waves of the Health and Retirement Study. Results: More than one quarter (28 %) of married men and two thirds of married women receiving employer-sponsored retirement <b>annuities</b> de-clined <b>survivor</b> protection. Men with small pensions and limited household wealth, men in better health than their spouses, and men whose spouses have pension coverage from their own employers are more likely than other men to reject survivor protection. Implica-tions: Most workers appear to make payout decisions by rationally balancing {{the costs and benefits of}} each type of annuity, suggesting that existing measures to encourage joint and <b>survivor</b> <b>annuities</b> are adequate. However, the growth in 401 (k) plans, which are generally not covered by existing laws protecting spousal pension rights, may leave widows vulnerable...|$|R
40|$|We analyse the {{mortality}} of couples by fitting a multiple state model {{to a large}} insurance data set. We find evidence that mortality rates increase {{after the death of}} a partner and, in addition, that this phenomenon diminishes over time. This is popularly known as a “broken-heart” effect and we find that it affects widowers more than widows. Remaining lifetimes of joint lives therefore exhibit short-term dependence. We carry out numerical work involving the pricing and valuation of typical contingent assurance contracts and of a joint life and <b>survivor</b> <b>annuity.</b> If insurers ignore dependence, or mis-specify it as long-term dependence, then significant mis-pricing and inappropriate provisioning can result.

50|$|While this {{catch-all}} definition {{has been}} interpreted by the courts to capture some hybrid pension plans like cash balance (CB) plans and pension equity plans (PEP), most pension plans offered by large businesses or government agencies are final average pay (FAP) plans, under which the monthly benefit {{is equal to the}} number of years worked multiplied by the member's salary at retirement multiplied by a factor known as the accrual rate. At a minimum, benefits are payable in normal form as a Single Life Annuity (SLA) for single participants or as a Qualified Joint and <b>Survivor</b> <b>Annuity</b> (QJSA) for married participants. Both normal forms are paid at Normal Retirement Age (usually 65) and may be actuarially adjusted for early or late commencement. Other optional forms of payment, such as lump sum distributions, may be available but are not required.|$|R
40|$|The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (commonly {{known as}} the Pension Reform Act and {{sometimes}} cited as ERISA) introduced a massive set of new rules for the pri-vate pension plan system.

40|$|The {{combined}} survival {{status of}} the insured lives is a critical problem when pricing and reserving insurance products {{with more than one}} life. Our preliminary experience examination of bivariate annuity data from a large Canadian insurance company shows that the relative risk of mortality for an individual increases after the loss of his/her spouse, and that the increase is especially dramatic shortly after bereavement. This preliminary result is supported by the empirical studies over the past 50 years, which suggest dependence between a husband and wife. The dependence between a married couple may be significant in risk management of joint-life policies. This dissertation progressively explores Markovian models in pricing and risk management of joint-life policies, illuminating their advantages in dependent modeling of joint time-until-death (or other exit time) random variables. This dissertation argues that in the dependent modeling of joint-life dependence, Markovian models are flexible, transparent, and easily extended. Multiple state models have been widely used in historic data analysis, particularly in the modeling of failures that have event-related dependence. This dissertation introduces a ¡°common shock¡± factor into a standard Markov joint-life mortality model, and then extends it to a semi-Markov model to capture the decaying effect of the "broken heart" factor. The proposed models transparently and intuitively measure the extent of three types of dependence: the instantaneous dependence, the short-term impact of bereavement, and the long-term association between lifetimes. Some copula-based dependence measures, such as upper tail dependence, can also be derived from Markovian approaches. Very often, death is not the only mode of decrement. Entry into long-term care and voluntary prepayment, for instance, can affect reverse mortgage terminations. The semi-Markov joint-life model is extended to incorporate more exit modes, to model joint-life reverse mortgage termination speed. The event-triggered dependence between a husband and wife is modeled. For example, one spouse's death increases the survivor's inclination to move close to kin. We apply the proposed model specifically to develop the valuation formulas for roll-up mortgages in the UK and Home Equity Conversion Mortgages in the US. We test the significance of each termination mode and then use the model to investigate the mortgage insurance premiums levied on Home Equity Conversion Mortgage borrowers. Finally, this thesis extends the semi-Markov joint-life mortality model to having stochastic transition intensities, for modeling joint-life longevity risk in last-survivor annuities. We propose a natural extension of Gompertz' law to have correlated stochastic dynamics for its two parameters, and incorporate it into the semi-Markov joint-life mortality model. Based on this preliminary joint-life longevity model, we examine the impact of mortality improvement on the cost of a last <b>survivor</b> <b>annuity,</b> and investigate the market prices of longevity risk in last <b>survivor</b> <b>annuities</b> using risk-neutral pricing theory...|$|R
40|$|Role of annuity income. The typical annuity {{seeks to}} offer {{protection}} against longevity risk—the risk of prematurely depleting one’s retirement savings—as {{well as a}} guaranteed income. Yet annuity take-up rates are low {{for a variety of}} reasons, including the presence of other annuity income sources such as Social Security, the desire for flexible spending in retirement, the loss of control and illiquidity associated with annuities, and inflation and credit risks. Fiduciary and tax rules. Department of Labor (DOL) fiduciary rules require plan sponsors to conduct a comprehensive credit analysis of any within-the-plan annuity provider, or to hire an independent expert to do so. Under tax rules, plans offering annuity payouts must also provide retirement income estimates and comply with joint and <b>survivor</b> <b>annuity</b> requirements. New generation of solutions. A broad array of retirement income solutions are emerging in the marketplace outside of the qualified plan environment. These innovations include nonguaranteed managed payout funds, flexible annuity contracts, and reverse mortgages. Implications. Sponsors can address participants’ retirement income needs by adding annuities (or other retirement income alternatives) as a distribution option within a defined contribution (DC) plan, or by accommodating their use “outside the plan. ” In the case of annuity options in particular, ERISA fiduciary rule may pose an obstacle to their widespread adoption as a within-plan solution. Meanwhile, many retirement income innovations are occurring outside of the qualified plan system. Retirement income strategies can also be incorporated into participant education and advice programs.

40|$|Excerpt] The {{military}} {{retirement system}} is a government-funded noncontributory, defined benefit system that has historically been viewed as a significant incentive in retaining a career military force. The system currently includes monthly compensation for qualified active and reserve retirees, disability benefits for those deemed medically unfit to serve, and a <b>survivor</b> <b>annuity</b> program for the eligible survivors of deceased retirees. The amount of compensation is dependent on time served, basic pay at retirement, and is adjusted annually through a Cost-of-Living-Adjustment (COLA). Military retirees are also entitled to nonmonetary benefits including exchange and commissary privileges, medical care through TRICARE, and access to Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) facilities and programs. Currently, active component personnel are eligible for retirement or “vested” after completing 20 years of service (YOS) and have a choice between two options (High-Three or Career Status Bonus/Redux) based on career expectations and the individual’s financial situation. Reserve personnel are eligible for retirement after 20 years of creditable service based on a points system, but do not typically begin to draw retirement pay until age 60. A third category of retirement is disability retirement. In FY 2013, $ 54 billion was paid to approximately 2. 2 million military retirees and survivors. Given {{the size of the}} program, some have viewed military retirement as a place where substantial budgetary savings could be made. However, others have argued that past modifications intended to save money have had a deleterious effect on military recruiting and retention. Military retirees, families, and veterans’ service organizations closely monitor potential future changes to the retirement system. When considering alternatives to the current system, Congress will likely consider the balance between budget constraints and the needs and concerns of this constituent group. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2013 established a Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) to provide the President and Congress with specific recommendations to modernize pay and benefits for the armed services. The commission recommended substantial changes to the current retirement system from a purely defined benefit system to a blended system. The new system would allow more servicemembers to develop retirement savings earlier in their careers through contributions into the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) coupled with government matching and early vesting, and would reduce the defined benefit multiplier for calculating the retirement annuity from 2. 5 % to 2. 0 %. The new multiplier would provide Servicemembers retiring at 20 years of service with 40 % of their “pay base” at retirement rather than 50 % under the current system. Under the commission’s proposed changes, existing servicemembers and retirees would be able to remain in the old system or opt into the new system...|$|R
