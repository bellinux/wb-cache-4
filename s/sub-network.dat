We quantitatively assessed which properties of specialised networks were present in a complex networks involving different interacting types such as saproxylic community, and how they can be organised in trophic food webs. The architecture, interacting patterns and food web composition were evaluated along <b>sub-networks,</b> analysing their implications to network robustness from random and directed extinction simulations.

40|$|In this paper, a {{technique}} for audio indexing based on speaker identification is proposed. When speakers are known a priori, a speaker index {{can be created}} in real time using the Viterbi algorithm to segment the audio into intervals from a single talker. Segmentation is performed using a hidden Markov model network consisting of interconnected speaker <b>sub-networks.</b> Speaker training data is used to initialize <b>sub-networks</b> for each speaker. <b>Sub-networks</b> {{can also be used}} to model silence, or non-speech sounds such as a musical theme. When no prior knowledge of the speakers is available, unsupervised segmentation is performed using a nonreal time iterative algorithm. The speaker <b>sub-networks</b> are first initialized, and segmentation is performed by iteratively generating a segmentation using the Viterbi algorithm, and retraining the <b>sub-networks</b> based on the results of the segmentation. Since the accuracy of the speaker segmentation depends on how well the speaker <b>sub-networks</b> are initialize [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} the Dynamic Capacity Network (DCN), a neural network that can adaptively assign its capacity across different {{portions of the}} input data. This is achieved by combining modules of two types: low-capacity <b>sub-networks</b> and high-capacity <b>sub-networks.</b> The low-capacity <b>sub-networks</b> are applied across most of the input, but also provide a guide to select a few portions of the input on which to apply the high-capacity <b>sub-networks.</b> The selection is made using a novel gradient-based attention mechanism, that efficiently identifies input regions for which the DCN's output is most sensitive and to which we should devote more capacity. We focus our empirical evaluation on the Cluttered MNIST and SVHN image datasets.

40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} indicates that gene products implicated in human cancers often cluster together in "hot spots" in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Additionally, small <b>sub-networks</b> within PPI networks that demonstrate synergistic differential expression with respect to tumorigenic phenotypes were recently shown to be more accurate classifiers of disease progression when compared to single targets identified by traditional approaches. However, many of these studies rely exclusively on mRNA expression data, a useful but limited measure of cellular activity. Proteomic profiling experiments provide information at the post-translational level, yet they generally screen only a limited fraction of the proteome. Here, we demonstrate that integration of these complementary data sources with a "proteomics-first" approach can enhance the discovery of candidate <b>sub-networks</b> in cancer that are well-suited for mechanistic validation in disease. We propose that small changes in the mRNA expression of multiple genes {{in the neighborhood of}} a protein-hub can be synergistically associated with significant changes in the activity of that protein and its network neighbors. Further, we hypothesize that proteomic targets with significant fold change between phenotype and control may be used to "seed" a search for small PPI <b>sub-networks</b> that are functionally associated with these targets. To test this hypothesis, we select proteomic targets having significant expression changes in human colorectal cancer (CRC) from two independent 2 -D gel-based screens. Then, we use random walk based models of network crosstalk and develop novel reference models to identify <b>sub-networks</b> that are statistically significant in terms of their functional association with these proteomic targets. Subsequently, using an information-theoretic measure, we evaluate synergistic changes in the activity of identified <b>sub-networks</b> based on genome-wide screens of mRNA expression in CRC. Cross-classification experiments to predict disease class show excellent performance using only a few <b>sub-networks,</b> underwriting the strength of the proposed approach in discovering relevant and reproducible <b>sub-networks...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} {{genetic algorithm}} needs to obtain some initial feasible solutions, {{so the first}} step is to extract some <b>sub-networks</b> from the original network with local source nodes and destination nodes. Extracting the <b>sub-networks</b> is applied by all operators of the proposed genetic algorithm and it is presented as a basic operator. We need to define three types of operators as described by Sivanandam and Deepa (2008) and Dréo et al. (2006). The initial population operator extracts some <b>sub-networks</b> and their required complement components to establish connections between the original source and destination nodes. Then, the crossover operator tries to obtain new populations from the current initial populations and to replace the worst ones with the best ones. To avoid probable local optimality, the mutation operator extends the search area of selecting local source and destination nodes. Therefore, the <b>sub-networks</b> inherit all characteristics of the original network; they are directed, acyclic and all nodes are reachable from the local source node and the local destination node is reachable form all nodes. A connection is a union of some <b>sub-networks,</b> those the local source node of one is the local destination node of another one and it can transmit flow from the original source node toward the original destination node.|$|R
