5|$|Due to flirtations with {{characters}} of various genders and sexuality, fans have speculated Deadpool as pan- or omnisexual. Writers Gerry Duggan and Gail Simone, {{as well as}} Terry Miller, {{the director of the}} Deadpool film, accepts the fan theory. However, Fabian Nicieza, one of the creators of the character, stated on Twitter that such speculation on his <b>sexuality</b> <b>is</b> invalid because his “brain cells are in CONSTANT FLUX. He can be gay one minute, hetero the next, etc.” The comment upset many fans, for it suggests that Deadpool’s <b>sexuality</b> <b>is</b> linked to his mental disorder.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sexuality</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} part of each person's identity, although some people might have no interest in sex. Sexuality has biological, psychological, emotional, spiritual, social, and cultural aspects. It involves not only sexual behaviors but relationships, self-image, sex drive, reproduction, sexual orientation, and gender expression. Each person's <b>sexuality</b> <b>is</b> influenced by lifelong socialization, in which factors such as religious and cultural background play a part, and is expressed in self-esteem and the beliefs one holds about oneself (identifying as a woman, or as an attractive person).|$|E
5|$|Female <b>sexuality</b> <b>is</b> {{often not}} {{adequately}} represented in texts and documents. Until very recently, {{much of what}} has been documented about women's sexuality has been written by men, in the context of male understanding, and relevant to women's associations to men—as their wives, daughters, or mothers, for example. Often artistic representations of female sexuality suggest trends or ideas on broad scales, giving historians clues as to how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were.|$|E
5000|$|In Japan, {{gender and}} <b>sexuality</b> <b>are</b> not {{conceptualized}} through a binary frame {{within the context}} of individualism (homo- heterosexual, man-woman) but rather through a spectrum wherein the various social roles of the “all encompassing” group are emphasized. Under this construction, expressions of gender and <b>sexuality</b> <b>are</b> varied, as is evidenced by Japan’s gender-bending communities.|$|R
40|$|This thesis theorizes the {{conceptual}} grid upon which discussions of <b>sexuality</b> <b>are</b> based in India's Great Epic, the Mahabharata. The Mahabharata contains complex multilevel taxonomies of sexuality, framed within hierarchies of religious experience. The thesis isolates {{two categories of}} religious experience: pravr&dotbelow;tti dharma ("involvement in the world"), and nivr&dotbelow;tti dharma ("renunciation of the world"). Within nivr&dotbelow;tti dharma, discourses on <b>sexuality</b> <b>are</b> inalienable from discourses on the body, and on asceticism. Within pravr&dotbelow;tti dharma, discourses on <b>sexuality</b> <b>are</b> anchored by parallel discourses on the dharmas of caste and stage of life (varn&dotbelow;asrama dharma), {{as well as on}} the dharmas based on sex and familial hierarchy. These subcategories are identified and the place of <b>sexuality</b> within them <b>is</b> drawn in detail...|$|R

5|$|According to writer Devin Grayson, {{the amount}} of {{creative}} freedom allowed by editors in the portrayal of LGBT characters depends upon how popular and established a character already is. Long-standing characters that would require a retcon to change their sexuality {{are less likely to}} be shown as LGBT than newer characters. When such changes to a character's continuity are made, fans are often disgruntled, particularly when <b>sexuality</b> <b>is</b> involved, and Alan Moore suggests that creating a new character is preferable.|$|E
5|$|Michael Moorcock {{was one of}} {{the first}} scifi authors to depict {{positive}} portrayals of homosexual, lesbian and bisexual relationships and sex in his novels. For example, in his 1965 novel, The Final Programme, most of the leading characters, including the central 'hero' Jerry Cornelius, engage in same sex relationships on multiple occasions and same sex relationships are depicted as entirely normal and without any moralising, negative consequences or gratuitous titillation, this is the case in the whole Jerry Cornelius series and in Moorcock's fiction generally (particularly in the Dancers at the End of Time series) <b>sexuality</b> <b>is</b> seen as polymorphic and fluid rather than based in fixed identities and gender roles.|$|E
5|$|Criticism of {{the film}} also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press. Horowitz points out {{that much of the}} Jewish {{activity}} seen in the ghetto consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading on the black market, or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life. Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and <b>sexuality</b> <b>is</b> not explored further. History professor Omer Bartov of Brown University notes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and Göth overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened – a mere backdrop to the struggle of good versus evil.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} explore the constructions of white male {{sexuality}} in late nineteenth-century Australia {{by the medical}} profession. In a period where female <b>sexuality</b> <b>was</b> always suspect, male <b>sexuality,</b> too, <b>was</b> brought into question, and the male body was increasingly constructed as vulnerable to sexual excess and sexual pathology. If male <b>sexuality</b> <b>was</b> to be active and dynamic, this could readily go too far, rendering men merely a slip away from deviance. Here, I will consider these notions of excess and constraint through an examination of sexual norms and perceived perversions, including sexual excess, sodomy and masturbation...|$|R

5|$|Many SCI {{patients}} have received misinformation {{about the effects}} of their injury on their sexual function and benefit from education about it. Although sexual education shortly after injury is known to be helpful and desired, it is frequently missing in rehabilitation settings; a common complaint from those who go through rehabilitation programs is that they offer insufficient information about sexuality. Longer-term education and counseling on sex after discharge from a hospital setting are especially important, yet <b>sexuality</b> <b>is</b> one of the most often neglected areas in long-term SCI rehabilitation, particularly for women. Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped to handle it. Clinicians must be circumspect in bringing up sexual matters since people may be uncomfortable with or unready for the subject. Many patients wait for providers to broach the topic even if they do want the information.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of sexual activity}} between women as necessary to define a lesbian or a relationship continues to be debated. According to feminist writer Naomi McCormick, women's <b>sexuality</b> <b>is</b> constructed by men, whose primary indicator of lesbian sexual orientation is sexual experience with other women. The same indicator {{is not necessary to}} identify a woman as heterosexual, however. McCormick states that emotional, mental, and ideological connections between women are as important or more so than the genital. Nonetheless, in the 1980s, a significant movement rejected the desexualization of lesbianism by cultural feminists, causing a heated controversy called the feminist sex wars. Butch and femme roles returned, although not as strictly followed {{as they were in the}} 1950s. They became a mode of chosen sexual self-expression for some women in the 1990s. Once again, women felt safer claiming to be more sexually adventurous, and sexual flexibility became more accepted.|$|E
5|$|Drugs, devices, surgery, {{and other}} {{interventions}} exist to help men achieve erection and ejaculation. Although male fertility is reduced, many men with SCI can still father children, particularly with medical interventions. Women's fertility {{is not usually}} affected, although precautions must be taken for safe pregnancy and delivery. People with SCI need to take measures during sexual activity to deal with SCI effects such as weakness and movement limitations, and to avoid injuries such as skin damage in areas of reduced sensation. Education and counseling about <b>sexuality</b> <b>is</b> {{an important part of}} SCI rehabilitation but is often missing or insufficient. Rehabilitation for children and adolescents aims to promote healthy development of sexuality and includes education for them and their families. Culturally inherited biases and stereotypes negatively affect people with SCI, particularly when held by professional caregivers. Body image and other insecurities affect sexual function, and have profound repercussions on self-esteem and self-concept. SCI causes difficulties in romantic partnerships, due to problems with sexual function and to other stresses introduced by the injury and disability, but many of those with SCI have fulfilling relationships and marriages. Relationships, self-esteem, and reproductive ability are all aspects of sexuality, which encompasses not just sexual practices but a complex array of factors: cultural, social, psychological, and emotional influences.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between naturism and <b>sexuality</b> <b>is</b> managed through social and spatial segregation. In commercial naturist resorts, eroticism and <b>sexuality</b> <b>is</b> controlled by applying hetero-normative values, and strict rules and policing. In other environments, eroticism is moderated through self-censorship of actions and behavior. This {{can make the}} practice of naturism an isolating, repressive, and anxious experience, rather than a liberating and social one.|$|E

50|$|For Roman citizens, {{marriage}} was a duty {{and was not}} meant {{for the purpose of}} fulfilling erotic needs. Therefore, it was considered normal for a male to look for sexual fulfillment outside marriage, though females did not have such liberty. Presumably, the main Greco-Roman moral view on human <b>sexuality</b> <b>was</b> that <b>sexuality</b> <b>was</b> good, as long as it did not interfere with a person's obligations to the state or family or involve the abuse of free children or married women. Other views stated that <b>sexuality</b> <b>was</b> dangerous and should be limited. People that held such beliefs would usually commit themselves to celibacy or limit their sexual activities either to marriage, or strictly for the purpose of procreation. Such views, though, did not preclude homosexual acts; they simply aimed to reduce promiscuous heterosexual activity.|$|R
