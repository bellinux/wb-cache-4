25|$|Historically, {{there has}} been an anthropocentric {{tendency}} to emphasize the study of animal psychopathologies as models for human mental illnesses. But animal psychopathologies can, from an evolutionary point of view, be more properly regarded as non-adaptive behaviors due to <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cognitive disability, emotional impairment or distress. This article provides a non-exhaustive list of animal psychopathologies.|$|E
25|$|In {{many parts}} of the world {{travelers}} have observed the custom of hanging objects upon trees in order to establish <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relationship between themselves and the tree. Throughout Europe, trees are known as sites of pilgrimages, ritual ambulation, and the recital of (Christian) prayers. Wreaths, ribbons or rags are suspended to win favor for sick humans or livestock, or merely for good luck. Popular belief associates the sites with healing, bewitching, or mere wishing.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} opponent was {{the young}} Serbian Empire, which was worn down {{by a series of}} campaigns, notably in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, in which the leaders of both armies were killed, and which gained a central role in Serbian folklore as an epic battle and beginning of the end for Serbia. Much of Serbia fell to the Ottomans by 1459, the Kingdom of Hungary made a partial reconquest in 1480, but it fell again by 1499. Territories of Serbian Empire were divided between Ottoman Empire, Republic of Venice and Royal Hungary, with remaining territories being in <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vassal status towards Hungary, until its own conquest.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{symptoms}} of autism spectrum disorders {{can interfere with}} the formation of interpersonal relations, such as a preference for routine actions, resistance to change, obsession with particular interests or rituals, and a lack of social skills. Children with autism {{have been found to be}} more likely to be close friends of one person, rather than having groups of friends. Additionally, they are more likely to be close friends of other children with <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> disability. A sense of parental attachment aids in the quality of friendships in children with autism spectrum disorders; a sense of attachment with one's parents compensates for a lack of social skills that would usually inhibit friendships.|$|E

Archer begins destroying their technology, and kills {{one of the three}} Reptilians. Two others try to escape with the deadly bio-agent, and Archer kills another one as they flee. The last Xindi escapes due to the interference of Loomis, who T'Pol stuns with her phaser. On the factory's roof, Archer corners him as he attempts to release the bio-agent. Archer and T'Pol tag all non-21st-century artefacts, and return to Enterprise. Loomis, still groggy in his car, is apprehended by real police officers and attempts to explain the [...] "lizard people" [...] and their [...] "ray guns." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Cunningham. Björk was impressed by Cunningham's original music videos for IDM musicians Autechre, Squarepusher, and Aphex Twin, and by his clear lines, science fiction inclinations, and discordant imagery. This resulted in the singer contacting him to meet at his London office; she brought Chinese Kama Sutra {{as a guide to}} what she wanted. Cunningham had also associated the track with sex upon hearing it, but could not {{figure out how to make}} the video explicit yet broadcastable. Regarding this, the singer confessed, [...] "I think the only thing I said was that I thought it was very white [...] and I'm trying to describe <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> heaven. But I wanted also to have the other level there, there would be lust, it wouldn't be just clean". She complemented saying she mentioned that the video should be [...] "white" [...] and [...] "frozen", and then it [...] "melts because of love" [...] and [...] "making love".|$|E
500|$|Kubrick {{found that}} Dr. Strangelove, a $2 million {{production}} which employed {{what became the}} [...] "first important visual effects crew in the world", {{would be impossible to}} make in the U.S. for various technical and political reasons, forcing him to move production to England. It was shot in 15 weeks, ending in April 1963, after which Kubrick spent eight months editing it. Peter Sellers again agreed to work with Kubrick, and ended up playing three different roles in the film. Upon release, the film stirred up much controversy and mixed opinions. The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther worried that it was a [...] "discredit and even contempt for our whole defense establishment... the most shattering sick joke I've ever come across", [...] while Robert Brustein of Out of This World in a February 1970 article called it a [...] "juvenalian satire". Kubrick responded to the criticism, stating: [...] "A satirist is someone who has a very skeptical view of human nature, but who still has the optimism to make <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> joke out of it. However brutal that joke might be". Today, the film is considered {{to be one of the}} sharpest comedy films ever made, and holds a near perfect 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 68 reviews as of August 2015. It was voted the 39th-greatest American film and third-greatest comedy film of all time by the American Film Institute, and in 2010, it was voted the sixth-best comedy film of all time by The Guardian.|$|E

Some gained the impression that the light horsemen and mounted riflemen were having <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Cook's tour". Naturally most of the photos were taken during these short rest periods as the long months of unending work and discomfort gave rare opportunities or inclinations for taking photos.|$|E
2500|$|The lonelygirl15 video blogs, {{which first}} {{appeared}} in mid-2006, featured Rose as a 16-year-old girl named Bree posting under the alias lonelygirl15. The videos, which seemed genuine and presented lonelygirl15 as an actual person, initially dealt with typical teenage angst issues but soon after introduced a bizarre narrative surrounding secret occult practices within her family. [...] The series was an immediate hit and became the most subscribed channel on YouTube but suspicions arose {{as to whether the}} videos were genuine or <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> promotional gimmick.|$|E

An OSS officer, reading a radio message that advised him how to reward heroic Kachin action, misinterpreted the abbreviation for [...] "comma" [...] ("CMA") as signifying <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> medal.

2500|$|Political {{scientist}} Boris Popivanov opines {{that the}} mass protests {{of the initial}} months were gradually replaced by smaller-scale demonstrations that emphasized [...] "creative and artistic elements" [...] as well as [...] "aesthetic provocations", which were not well understood and difficult to relate to by the wider public. Thus, the accent on various theatric aspects is seen to have inadvertently obscured the underlying goal of forcing a government resignation. Political researcher Ivan Nachev suggests that the demonstrations needed to be held less frequently, but with a higher turnout, better organization and protest messages that were clearly formulated, so that the protest movement did not fall into the trappings of banalization. He also urged both {{the government and the}} protesters to show greater determination to find <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> middle ground when engaging in dialogue.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} masonic texts each contain <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{history of}} the craft, or mystery, of masonry. The oldest known work of this type, The Halliwell Manuscript, or Regius Poem, dates from between 1390 and 1425. This document has a brief history in its introduction, stating that the [...] "craft of masonry" [...] began with Euclid in Egypt, and came to England in the reign of King Athelstan (born about 894, died 27 October 939). Shortly afterwards, the Cooke Manuscript traces masonry to Jabal son of Lamech (Genesis 4: 20–22), and tells how this knowledge came to Euclid, from him to the Children of Israel (while they were in Egypt), and so on through an elaborate path to Athelstan. This myth {{formed the basis for}} subsequent manuscript constitutions, all tracing masonry back to biblical times, and fixing its institutional establishment in England during the reign of Athelstan (927–939).|$|E
