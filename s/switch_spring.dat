Switch-mode hydraulic {{control is a}} compact and theoretically efficient alternative to throttling valve control or variable displacement pump control. The virtually variable displacement circuit created by a pulse-width modulated high-speed valve has drawbacks, such as large energy losses due to throttling and compressibility during valve transitions. Hydraulic soft switching was proposed as method of reducing the throttling energy loss, by absorbing, in a small variable volume chamber, the flow that would normally be throttled across the transitioning high speed valve. An active locking mechanism was presented by Van de Ven that overcomes the main challenge with soft switching, which is a lock mechanism that releases quickly and with precise timing. A numerical model is developed for a switch-mode pumping circuit, utilizing the proposed soft switch. The model is then used {{as a means of}} designing a proof of concept prototype to further verify the model and provide a future optimization tool. The prototype design includes methods for controlling the soft <b>switch</b> <b>spring</b> preload, travel distance, piston displacement required to unlock the soft switch, valve command duty ratio, switching cycle length, and load pressure. Testing demonstrated that the soft switch circuit performed as expected within a set of parameter values, defining normal operation. High control valve switching periods, high load pressures, high flow rates, low soft switch unlocking distances, and low spring preloads caused the soft switch to unlock prematurely in the switching cycle. This resulted in the soft switch to failing to absorb the switched volume pressure spike during control valve transitions, leading to low efficiencies. Under normal operating conditions, the soft switch circuit was calculated to be 60. 9 % efficient, which is lower than the 62. 1 % efficiency for same circuit without a soft switch, and also lower than the 70. 5 % efficiency predicted by the numerical model. The discrepancies between the numerical and experimental model can be attributed to poor resolution in the measurement instruments, as well as the model not accurately capturing flow dynamics through the check valves behind the soft switch piston. Since the soft switch parameters were chosen to validate the lock release concept, and not to maximize efficiency, it was not unexpected that the baseline soft switch case had lower efficiency than the control case. Using the insights gained from these model comparisons, an efficient locking soft switch can be designed for use in a dual soft switch circuit scheme, shown by Van de Ven to reduce energy losses by 66 % compared to a control circuit. A successful hydraulic soft switch circuit will allow for the use of slower switching valves, which will reduce component cost as well as energy consumption...|$|E

This is sometimes known as running through the switch. Some switches are designed to be forced to the proper position without damage.

5000|$|The May 2002 Potters Bar rail crash at Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, in the United Kingdom, {{occurred}} when a <b>switch</b> <b>sprang</b> {{to a different}} position as a coach crossed it, a type of mishap called [...] "splitting the switch." [...] The front wheels of a coach progressed along the straight track as intended, but the rear wheels slewed along the diverging track. This caused the whole coach to detach from the train and slew sideways across the platform ahead. The movement of the switch occurred beneath the final coach, so that although seven people were killed, the front coaches remained on the tracks. Poor maintenance of the points {{was found to be}} the primary cause of the crash.|$|R

50|$|On {{the morning}} of the derailment, Norfolk Southern train 703 {{approached}} the <b>spring</b> <b>switch</b> at the west end of the Boyd Siding and was given a signal restriction. The crew of 703 stopped in the siding and examined the <b>spring</b> <b>switch</b> at the east end of the siding, noting a 1/4-inch gap was present between the switch point and the stock rail. The crew manually operated the switch several times and noted that the switch still had a small 1/8-inch gap. The 703 engineer radioed Norfolk Southern dispatch to report the issue. Train 703 then proceeded through the switch without incident.|$|R

40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a door closer which has a closing spring for automatically closing the door. When the door is opened manually, the closing spring is compressed. An opening resistance is thus produced. The door is then closed automatically through {{the action of the}} closing spring. To obtain greater operating convenience, the invention strives to achieve as low an opening resistance in the door closer as possible when the door is opened manually, but nevertheless closing the door reliably during the closing process. This problem is solved {{by the fact that the}} characteristic of the torque acting on the leaf and depending on the rotary angle of the leaf is different for opening than for closing as a result of the interaction of the sliding spring with a control curve which has separate curve sections for opening and closing. This is achieved by a gear wheel in the form of a cam gear interacting with the closing spring with one opening cam and one closing cam. The separate control curve section for opening is on the opening cam and the separate control curve section for closing is on the closing cam. Between the closing spring and the opening and closing cams there is a pressure piece controlled by a <b>switching</b> <b>spring...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Once four {{cars were}} loaded, {{they were once}} again allowed to roll {{downhill}} to a special section of track called the [...] "Reverser Track". As the cars rolled onto the Reverser Track, they would immediately start rolling uphill until {{they came to a}} stop and started rolling back the way they came. They would then pass over a special <b>switch,</b> called a <b>spring</b> <b>switch,</b> that would send the four loaded cars to one of two [...] "saucer" [...] tracks. These tracks were built in a shape of a saucer, with each end higher than middle. The cars would roll into the saucer track and settle at the bottom. When the next four loaded cars arrived, they would couple to the cars already there without damaging the cars and the entire line of cars would be evenly settled on the saucer track.|$|R

50|$|Tipping {{points with}} a very small {{separation}} distance between equilibrium states are used in microswitches.

5000|$|In the {{construction}} of many small <b>switches,</b> the <b>spring</b> that stores the mechanical energy necessary for the snap action of the switch mechanism is made of a beryllium copper alloy that is hardened to form a spring {{as part of the}} fabrication of the contact. The same part often also forms the body of the contact itself, and is thus the current path. Abusing the switch mechanism to hold the contacts in a transition state, or severely overloading the switch, will heat and thus anneal the spring, reducing or eliminating the [...] "snap action" [...] of the switch, leading to slower transitions, more energy dissipated in the switch, and progressive failure.|$|R

50|$|In {{a typical}} {{diverter}} <b>switch</b> powerful <b>springs</b> are tensioned by a low power motor (motor drive unit, MDU), and then rapidly released {{to effect the}} tap changing operation. To reduce arcing at the contacts, the tap changer operates in a chamber filled with insulating transformer oil, or inside a vessel filled with pressurized SF6 gas. Reactance-type tap changers, when operating in oil, must allow for the additional inductive transients generated by the autotransformer and commonly include a vacuum bottle contact in parallel with the diverter switch. During a tap change operation, the potential rapidly increases between the two electrodes in the bottle, {{and some of the}} energy is dissipated in an arc discharge through the bottle instead of flashing across the diverter switch contacts.|$|R
5000|$|A coilover is an {{automobile}} suspension device. [...] "Coilover" [...] {{is short for}} [...] "coil spring over shock". It consists of a shock absorber with a coil spring encircling it. The shock absorber and spring are assembled as a unit prior to installation, and are replaced as a unit when the shock absorber has leaked. This provides damping without torsional loads. Some coilovers allow adjustment of ride height and preload, using a simple threaded spring perch similar to a nut. More advanced adjustable coilover systems use a threaded shock body, along with an adjustable lower mount for ride height adjustment, while an adjustment knob is used to adjust damping. Stiffness is changed by <b>switching</b> the <b>spring</b> for one with a different spring rate.|$|R
