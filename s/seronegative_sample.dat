An {{assessment}} of biomarkers from {{an analysis of}} human peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene-expression profiles was made, to acquire an understanding of transcriptional changes associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection in vivo. Methods. Supervised learning algorithms were used to create signature gene sets {{that could be used}} to distinguish seropositive from <b>seronegative</b> <b>samples</b> and delineate changes in disease status during the early stages of infection. Bioinformatic tools were used to classify persons and to functionally characterize groups of differentially expressed genes, to elucidate the impact of viral infection on host cell gene-expression patterns. Results. A 10 -gene signature set {{that could be used to}} accurately determine the HIV- 1 serostatus was identified. A 6 -gene signature set was used to distinguish seropositive persons exhibiting differential changes in CD 4 + T cell counts, with 93 % accuracy. Functional classification of differentially expressed genes in HIV- 1 indicated a pre-ponderance of down-regulated genes with functions related to the immune response and apoptosis. Hierarchical cluster analysis in persons whose CD 4 + T cell counts increased, compared with that in persons whose CD 4 + T cell counts decreased, was characterized by the down-regulation of genes associated with apoptosis, mitochondrial function, protein biosynthesis, and RNA binding.

40|$|Introduction: Avian {{influenza}} viruses circulate in bird populations, and it {{is important}} to maintain and uphold our knowledge of the viral strains that are currently of interest in this context. Here, we describe the use of hemagglutinin-pseudotype retroviruses based on highly pathogenic influenza viruses for the screening of avian sera for influenza A antibodies. Our aim was also to determine whether the pseudovirus neutralization tests that we assessed were sensitive and simple to use compared to the traditional methods, including hemagglutination inhibition assays and microneutralization tests. Material and methods: H 5 and H 7 pseudovirus neutralization tests were evaluated by using serum from infected rabbits. Subsequently, the assays were further investigated using a panel of serum samples from avian species. The panel contained samples that were seropositive for five different hemagglutinin subtypes as well as influenza A <b>seronegative</b> <b>samples.</b> Results and discussion: The results suggest that the pseudovirus neutralization test is an alternative to hemagglutination inhibition assays, as we observed comparable titers to those of both standard microneutralizations assays as well as hemagglutinin inhibition assays. When evaluated by a panel of avian sera, the method also showed its capability to recognize antibodies directed toward low-pathogenic H 5 and H 7. Hence, we conclude {{that it is possible to}} use pseudoviruses based on highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses to screen avian sera for antibodies directed against influenza A subtypes H 5 and H 7...|$|R

40|$|We {{recently}} introduced a homogeneous immunoassay based on time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) elic-ited by fluorophore-labeled antigen and fluorophore-labeled protein L, bound by an immunoglobulin. As the first clinical appli-cation, we employ this approach (LFRET) in serodiagnosis of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) infection. A reference panel contain-ing serum from individuals with acute (n 21) or past (n 17) PUUV infection and from PUUV-seronegative individuals (n 20) {{was used to}} define the parameters. The clinical assay performance was evaluated with a prospectively collected serum panel (panel 2; n 153). Based on the results for panel 1, the threshold for positivity was set at a signal level that was 3 -fold over back-ground, while those with a signal< 3 -fold over the background level were considered PUUV seronegative. With panel 1, 20 / 21 acute- and 7 / 10 past-infection samples induced positive signals, compared to 0 / 20 seronegatives. With panel 2, a positive signal was obtained in 39 / 40 acute- and 4 / 10 past-infection samples, as opposed to 7 / 103 seronegatives. However, after IgG depletion, 58 / 61 acute-infection samples were LFRET positive, while all past-infection and <b>seronegative</b> <b>samples</b> were negative, correspond-ing to 100 % specificity and 95 % sensitivity in detection of acute PUUV infection.

We found that this new Toxoplasma ICT IgG-IgM POC test was highly sensitive (100 %) and specific (100 %) for distinguishing IgG/IgM-positive from negative sera. Use of such reliable POC tests can be cost-saving and benefit patients. Our work demonstrates that the Toxoplasma ICT IgG-IgM test can function reliably as a point-of-care test to diagnose Toxoplasma gondii infection in the U. S.

Testing is usually performed in clinical pathology laboratories on automated analysers. To investigate the cause of false positive results on 4 th generation HIV testing platforms in public sector laboratories, the performance of two automated platforms was compared in a clinical pathology setting, firstly on routine diagnostic specimens and secondly on known sero-negative samples. Firstly, 1181 routine diagnostic specimens were sequentially tested on Siemens and Roche automated 4 th generation platforms. HIV viral load, western blot and follow up testing {{were used to determine}} the true status of inconclusive specimens. Subsequently, known HIV <b>seronegative</b> <b>samples</b> from a single donor were repeatedly tested on both platforms and an analyser was tested for surface contamination with HIV positive serum to identify how suspected specimen contamination could be occurring. Serial testing of diagnostic specimens yielded 163 weakly positive or discordant results. Only 3 of 163 were conclusively shown to indicate true HIV infection. Specimen contamination with HIV antibody was suspected, based on the following evidence: the proportion of positive specimens increased on repeated passage through the analysers; viral loads were low or undetectable and western blots negative or indeterminate on problem specimens; screen negative, 2 nd test positive specimens tested positive when reanalysed on the screening assay; follow up specimens (where available) were negative. Similarly, an increasing number of known negative specimens became (repeatedly) sero-positive on serial passage through one of the analysers. Internal and external analyser surfaces were contaminated with HIV serum, evidence that sample splashes occur during testing. Due to the extreme sensitivity of these assays, contamination with minute amounts of HIV antibody can cause a negative sample to test positive.

MethodsThe present study describes the clinical observations and laboratory investigations involving molecular methods performed on 170 of the 2000 clinically suspected cases. These were patients who were admitted to Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai, Tamil Nadu with ocular complications. Conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR, and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal gene amplification (RT-LAMP) assays were used to detect West Nile virus (WNV) infection. Further investigation of the genetic diversity of the WNV implicated in ocular complications was undertaken by sequence phylogeny. ResultsOut of 170 samples, 25 (15 %) were positive for chikungunya IgM antibody, 10 (6 %) for chikungunya antigen, and 30 (18 %) were positive for dengue IgM antibody. The remaining 105 <b>seronegative</b> <b>samples</b> were further processed for WNV detection by IgM capture ELISA and molecular methods. Out of the 105 samples, 35 (33 %) were positive for WNV IgM antibody, 15 (14 %) were positive for WNV by RT-PCR, and 27 (26 %) {{were found to be}} positive for WNV by both real-time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assays. Comparative evaluation with acute-phase patient serum samples revealed 100 % concordance between the real-time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assays. These assays had an overall higher sensitivity than the conventional RT-PCR as they picked up 12 additional samples with a low copy number of template. Further genotyping through sequence phylogeny revealed that all the WNV isolates were grouped in lineage I. ConclusionsThe association of West Nile virus with ocular infection in South India during an epidemic of mysterious fever {{in the first half of}} 2010 was clearly established through molecular approaches employing envelope gene-specific real-time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assays followed by nucleotide sequencing...|$|R
40|$|Objective Antibodies to cell surface {{central nervous}} system {{proteins}} help to diagnose conditions which often respond to immunotherapies. The assessment of antibody assays needs to reflect their clinical utility. We report {{the results of a}} multicentre study of aquaporin (AQP) 4 antibody (AQP 4 -Ab) assays in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD). Methods Coded samples from patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or NMOSD (101) and controls (92) were tested at 15 European diagnostic centres using 21 assays including live (n= 3) or fixed cell-based assays (n= 10), flow cytometry (n= 4), immunohistochemistry (n= 3) and ELISA (n= 1). Results Results of tests on 92 controls identified 12 assays as highly specific (0 - 1 false-positive results). 32 samples from 50 (64 %) NMO sera and 34 from 51 (67 %) NMOSD sera were positive on {{at least two of the}} 12 highly specific assays, leaving 35 patients with seronegative NMO/spectrum disorder (SD). On the basis of a combination of clinical phenotype and the highly specific assays, 66 AQP 4 -Ab seropositive samples were used to establish the sensitivities (51. 5 - 100 %) of all 21 assays. The specificities (85. 8 - 100 %) were based on 92 control <b>samples</b> and 35 <b>seronegative</b> NMO/SD patient <b>samples.</b> Conclusions The cell-based assays were most sensitive and specific overall, but immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry could be equally accurate in specialist centres. Since patients with AQP 4 -Ab negative NMO/SD require different management, the use of both appropriate control <b>samples</b> and defined <b>seronegative</b> NMOSD <b>samples</b> is essential to evaluate these assays in a clinically meaningful way. The process described here can be applied to the evaluation of other antibody assays in the newly evolving field of autoimmune neurology...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Direct smear {{examination}} with Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining for {{the diagnosis}} of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is cheap and easy to use, but its low sensitivity is a major drawback, particularly in HIV seropositive patients. As such, new tools for laboratory diagnosis are urgently needed to improve the case detection rate, especially in regions with a high prevalence of TB and HIV. Objective To evaluate the performance of two in house PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) : PCR dot-blot methodology (PCR dot-blot) and PCR agarose gel electrophoresis (PCR-AG) for {{the diagnosis of}} Pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB) in HIV seropositive and HIV seronegative patients. Methods A prospective study was conducted (from May 2003 to May 2004) in a TB/HIV reference hospital. Sputum specimens from 277 PTB suspects were tested by Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) smear, Culture and in house PCR assays (PCR dot-blot and PCR-AG) and their performances evaluated. Positive cultures combined with the definition of clinical pulmonary TB were employed as the gold standard. Results The overall prevalence of PTB was 46 % (128 / 277); in HIV +, prevalence was 54. 0 % (40 / 74). The sensitivity and specificity of PCR dot-blot were 74 % (CI 95 %; 66. 1 %- 81. 2 %) and 85 % (CI 95 %; 78. 8 %- 90. 3 %); and of PCR-AG were 43 % (CI 95 %; 34. 5 %- 51. 6 %) and 76 % (CI 95 %; 69. 2 %- 82. 8 %), respectively. For HIV seropositive and HIV <b>seronegative</b> <b>samples,</b> sensitivities of PCR dot-blot (72 % vs 75 %; p = 0. 46) and PCR-AG (42 % vs 43 %; p = 0. 54) were similar. Among HIV seronegative patients and PTB suspects, ROC analysis presented the following values for the AFB smear (0. 837), Culture (0. 926), PCR dot-blot (0. 801) and PCR-AG (0. 599). In HIV seropositive patients, these area values were (0. 713), (0. 900), (0. 789) and (0. 595), respectively. Conclusion Results of this study demonstrate that the in house PCR dot blot may be an improvement for ruling out PTB diagnosis in PTB suspects assisted at hospitals with a high prevalence of TB/HIV. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{national}} survey of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections among dialysis patients in The Netherlands was performed. The study involved 2, 653 patients (2, 108 hemodialysis patients and 545 chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis [CAPD] patients) from 39 of the 49 dialysis centers in the country. Patient sera were analyzed by both serological and molecular methods. Screening by a third-generation enzyme immunoassay (EIA) yielded 79 reactive sera. The presence of anti-HCV antibodies was confirmed in 70 patients by a line immunoassay. All seropositive samples were tested by reverse transcriptase PCR, and 57 samples were found to contain HCV RNA. Of the nine EIA-positive and line immunoassay-negative or indeterminate samples, four were HCV RNA positive. All <b>seronegative</b> <b>samples</b> were screened {{for the presence of}} HCV RNA in pools of five sera. Of 2, 576 antibody-negative samples, 6 contained HCV RNA. All antibody-positive and RNA-positive samples were also tested by a second serological assay. The prevalence of HCV infections among Dutch dialysis patients as determined by serology or the presence of HCV RNA was 3 % (80 of 2, 653), i. e., 3. 5 % (73 of 2, 108) in patients treated on hemodialysis and 1. 3 % (7 of 545) in patients on CAPD. Of these 80 HCV-infected dialysis patients, 67 (84 %) were HCV RNA positive. Serological screening alone would have diagnosed only 70 infected patients. Therefore, antibody screening combined with detection of HCV RNA should be considered as the “gold standard” for diagnosing HCV infection in dialysis patients. The prevalence of HCV-infected patients in Dutch dialysis centers ranged from 0 to 8 %, suggesting the existence of local risk factors for acquiring HCV infection. Genotyping analysis by reverse hybridization line probe assay revealed the presence of genotypes 1 a (23 %), 1 b (46 %), 2 (3 %), 2 a (13 %), 2 b (1 %), 3 a (7 %), and 4 a (4 %). In four (6 %) samples multiple genotypes were detected. The genotype distribution of HCV isolates among Dutch dialysis patients was similar to the distribution among nondialysis patients from the Benelux, except for subtype 1 a, which was significantly more prevalent among dialysis patients. In only one center, a high prevalence of an uncommon genotype was suggestive of infection from a common source...|$|R
40|$|A {{nationwide}} prospective {{survey on}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections among dialysis patients in The Netherlands was performed. Patients {{were recruited from}} 34 dialysis centers and were tested for antibodies and HCV RNA in 1995 and 1997. <b>Seronegative</b> serum <b>samples</b> were analyzed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in pools. HCV-RNA-positive serum samples were genotyped and were partly sequenced. In {{the first and second}} rounds, 67 (2. 9 %) of 2281 and 76 (3. 4 %) of 2286 patients were HCV positive, respectively. Of 960 patients with paired serum samples, 35 were HCV positive in both rounds, and 9 HCV-positive cases were newly identified in the second round. The incidence of HCV infection was 0. 5 per 100 dialysis years. Phylogenetic analysis revealed clustered sequences that indicated nosocomial transmission. Sixty percent of HCV infections, however, can be attributed to 4 interdependent risk factors (i. e., hemodialysis before 1992, kidney transplantation before 1994, and birth or dialysis in a foreign country). In conclusion, the prevalence of HCV infections in The Netherlands does not decline, and transmission within dialysis units continues. Adequate screening of HCV infections and strict enforcement of universal infection control practices are required...|$|R
40|$|The QUANTIPLEX HIV- 1 RNA assay, version 3. 0 (a {{branched}} DNA, version 3. 0, assay [bDNA 3. 0 assay]), {{was evaluated}} by analyzing spiked and clinical plasma samples and was {{compared with the}} AMPLICOR HIV- 1 MONITOR Ultrasensitive (ultrasensitive reverse transcription-PCR [US-RT-PCR]) method. A panel of spiked plasma samples that contained 0 to 750, 000 copies of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) RNA per ml was tested four times in each of four laboratories (1, 344 assays). Negative results (< 50 copies/ml) were obtained in 30 of 32 (94 %) assays with <b>seronegative</b> <b>samples,</b> 66 of 128 (52 %) assays with HIV- 1 RNA at 50 copies/ml, and 5 of 128 (4 %) assays with HIV- 1 RNA at 100 copies/ml. The assay was linear from 100 to 500, 000 copies/ml. The within-run standard deviation (SD) of the log 10 estimated HIV- 1 RNA concentration was 0. 08 at 1, 000 to 500, 000 copies/ml, increased below 1, 000 copies/ml, and was 0. 17 at 100 copies/ml. Between-run reproducibility at 100 to 500 copies/ml was < 0. 10 log 10 in most comparisons. Interlaboratory differences across runs were ≤ 0. 10 log 10 at all concentrations examined. A subset of the panel (25 to 500 copies/ml) was also analyzed by the US-RT-PCR assay. The within-run SD varied inversely with the log 10 HIV- 1 RNA concentration but was higher than the SD for the bDNA 3. 0 assay at all concentrations. Log-log regression analysis indicated that the two methods produced very similar estimates at 100 to 500 copies/ml. In parallel testing of clinical specimens with low HIV- 1 RNA levels, 80 plasma samples with < 50 copies/ml by the US-RT-PCR assay had < 50 copies/ml when they were retested by the bDNA 3. 0 assay. In contrast, 11 of 78 (14 %) plasma samples with < 50 copies/ml by the bDNA 3. 0 assay had ≥ 50 copies/ml when they were retested by the US-RT-PCR assay (median, 86 copies/ml; range, 50 to 217 copies/ml). Estimation of bDNA 3. 0 values of < 50 copies/ml by extending the standard curve of the assay showed that these samples with discrepant results had higher HIV- 1 RNA levels than the samples with concordant results (median, 34 versus 17 copies/ml; P = 0. 0051 by the Wilcoxon two-sample test). The excellent reproducibility, broad linear range, and good sensitivity of the bDNA 3. 0 assay make it a very attractive method for quantitation of HIV- 1 RNA levels in plasma...|$|R
40|$|Parts of {{the large}} {{phosphorylated}} tegument protein, pp 150, of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) were expressed in bacteria. The resulting fusion proteins were tested in a Western blot (immunoblot) assay for reactivity with a monoclonal antibody against pp 150, with a polyspecific rabbit antiserum, and with human reconvalescent-phase sera. Those fusion proteins that performed well in the Western blot assay were used as antigens in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) {{for the detection of}} antibodies against HCMV. Five different recombinant beta-galactosidase fusion proteins were evaluated by ELISA using 62 seropositive and 38 <b>seronegative</b> human serum <b>samples.</b> Of all the proteins tested, one peptide representing 162 amino acids of pp 150 was superior to the others with regard to sensitivity and specificity. All sera known to be positive for antibodies against HCMV were identified by combining the results of the ELISAs with the different pp 150 fusion proteins. Therefore, it appears that peptides from a single protein of HCMV might be sufficient to identify HCMV-seropositive individuals by recombinant ELISA...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAbstractEmergent hypermucoviscosity (HMV) phenotypes of Klebsiella pneumoniae {{have been}} {{associated}} with increased invasiveness and pathogenicity in primates. In this study, we investigated the interaction of African green monkeys (AGM) (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus) complement and antibody with HMV and non-HMV isolates as in vitro models of primate infection. Significantly greater survival of HMV isolates was evident after incubation in normal serum or whole blood (p <  0. 05) of AGM donors when compared to non-HMV strains. Greater survival of HMV strains (p <  0. 05) was found after incubation in whole blood and serum from seropositive donors when compared to <b>seronegative</b> donor <b>samples.</b> Additionally, significantly greater amounts of K. pneumoniae were phagocytozed by AGM leukocytes when complement was active (p <  0. 05), but no difference in uptake was observed when serum from seropositive or seronegative animals was used in challenged cells utilizing flow cytometry. Results demonstrate that interaction of cellular and humoral immune elements {{play a role in the}} in vitro killing of K. pneumoniae, particularly HMV isolates. Neither AGM serum, nor washed whole blood effectively killed HMV isolates; however, assays using heparinized whole blood of seronegative donors significantly reduced viability of HMV and non-HMV strains. The lack of bacterial killing observed in seropositive donors treatments could be at least partially associated with low IgG 2 present in these animals. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of klebsiellosis in primates and host immune response is necessary to identify surface molecules that can induce both opsonizing and bactericidal antibody facilitating killing of Klebsiella, and the development of vaccines in human and animals...|$|R
40|$|Eight Belgian AIDS Reference Laboratories {{established}} a multicentre quality control {{to evaluate the}} performance of their diagnostic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A set of Belgian and African HIV- 1 seropositive and <b>seronegative</b> patient <b>samples,</b> collected in Belgium, and the British Medical Research Council (MRC) HIV- 1 PCR reference reagent kit, containing plasmid HIV- 1 DNA at several dilutions in human carrier DNA with appropriate negative controls, were tested by the laboratories. No false positive results were reported. Ah laboratories were able to detect one to two copies of HIV- 1 DNA. Among the 17 Belgian and African HIV- 1 seropositives, some laboratories reported up to four indeterminate results, mainly due to failure of the SK 38 - 39, SK 68 - 69 (Ou et al. (1988) Science 239, 295 - 297) and/or gag 881 - 882 (Simmonds et al. (1990) J. Virol. 64, 864 - 872) primers and a poorly performing algorithm. Only the H 1 POL 4235 - 4538 nested pol primer set, developed by one of the laboratories, correctly identified all the tested HIV- 1 positive and negative samples. Consequently, the laboratories decided to evaluate these pol primers as a reference primer set and to standardise the testing algorithm. All laboratories achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 100 % on testing 10 additional Belgian and African patient samples, when adapting a standardised algorithm based on three HIV- 1 primer sets, one of which is the H 1 POL 4235 - 4538 primer set...|$|R
40|$|The major {{antigenic}} protein 2 (MAP 2) homolog of Ehrlichia chaffeensis was cloned and expressed. The {{recombinant protein}} was characterized and tested in an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) format for potential application in the serodiagnosis of human monocytic ehrlichiosis. The recombinant protein, which contained a C-terminal polyhistidine tag, had a molecular mass of approximately 26 kDa. The antigen was clearly identified by Western immunoblotting using antihistidine antibody. However, immune sera failed to react with the recombinant on immunoblots when the antigen was denatured by heat or reduced using β-mercaptoethanol. The recombinant MAP 2 (rMAP 2) was used in an ELISA format with 60 blinded serum samples. Twenty of the serum samples were previously demonstrated to contain antibodies reactive with E. chaffeensis by indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFAs). The remaining 40 <b>samples</b> were <b>seronegative.</b> All <b>samples</b> negative by IFA were also found to be negative for antibodies against the rMAP 2 of E. chaffeensis by using the ELISA.

Of these, samples from 25 wood rats (34 % of those tested) and 10 (8 %) Peromyscus sp. mice {{were found to be}} seropositive, but only those from one site. PCR assays targeting the groESL heat shock operon were conducted on all seropositive specimens and a subset of seronegative blood specimens. Ehrlichial DNA was identified in 17 (68 %) of the 25 seropositive wood rat blood samples and in 1 of the 10 (10 %) Peromyscus sp. specimens. None of 40 <b>seronegative</b> blood <b>samples</b> was PCR positive. Both seropositive and PCR-positive animals {{were collected}} during each trapping period.
