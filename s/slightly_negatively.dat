40|$|A common {{approach}} for quantifying landscape pattern through landscape metrics {{is to use}} categorical maps of entire landscape. However, a new interest is to use sampling data where the data are collected for {{only a small fraction}} of the entire landscape. In sample based approaches some currently used landscape metrics may not be estimated since these metrics are defined based on mapped data. Shannon’s diversity index is a frequently used metric in landscape pattern analysis. In this study, the performance of the normalized Shannon’s diversity index is demonstrated when using sampled full-coverage maps and then point sampling on the maps. Artificial and real landscapes have been employed for this purpose. The results showed that calculation of the normalized Shannon’s diversity index based on the number of land cover types in the entire classification system is more appropriate than based on the number of land cover types present within landscape.

Membrane cleaning was simulated by exposing the virgin membrane samples to cleaning reagents including acidic, caustic, {{sodium dodecyl sulphate}} (SDS), and ethylenediaminetetraacetic-acid (EDTA) under controlled conditions. Prolonged exposure to acid and SDS rendered the membrane <b>slightly</b> less <b>negatively</b> charged. Caustic and acidic cleaning, however, resulted in a marked increase in the membrane surface hydrophobicity. In addition, it is hypothesised that chemical cleaning may alter the porosity of the polymeric matrix and even the hydrophilicity within the membrane active layer. Indeed, caustic cleaning led {{to an increase in}} the membrane permeability while acidic cleaning produced the opposite effect. An increase in the membrane permeability was also observed as a result of SDS and EDTA cleaning. This hypothesis is also supported by the rejection data. Among the four reagents investigated, strong caustic cleaning (pH 11. 5 and 12) resulted in a significant decrease in both conductivity and carbamazepine rejection. Chemical cleaning did not affect the rejection of the negatively charged sulfamethoxazole (pH 8 - 10). However, below pH 8, there was considerable effect of caustic cleaning on the rejection of sulfamethoxazole. A small reduction in salt rejection was also found after strong acidic cleaning (pH 1. 5).

We {{analyzed}} levels of IL- 33 in serum, and investigated the possible role of IL- 33 in oxidative stress. Methods A total of 191 subjects with advanced systolic CHF (CHF group), 175 patients with pre-existing cardiac diseases but no CHF (non-CHF group), and 177 healthy controls (HC group) were enrolled. Serum levels of IL- 33, soluble ST 2 (sST 2) and N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), malondialdehyde (MDA) content, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (eSOD) activity, as well as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), were determined. The exact form of IL- 33 in serum was identified. Effects of IL- 33 and sST 2 on MDA content and SOD activity in angiotensin (Ang II) -stimulated AC 16 cells were assessed. Results Serum levels of IL- 33 and sST 2 were elevated in CHF patients, whereas IL- 33 /sST 2 ratios were decreased. In CHF patients, pre-existing cardiac diseases and medications used upon hospital admission did not affect IL- 33 concentrations or the IL- 33 /sST 2 ratio. Full-length IL- 33, which could not be detected in serum from HC and barely detected in non-CHF patients, was significantly up-regulated in CHF patients. IL- 33 levels were positively correlated with markers of CHF severity. IL- 33 /sST 2 ratios were <b>slightly</b> and <b>negatively</b> related to MDA concentrations. IL- 33 directly reduced MDA and enhanced SOD activity in Ang II-stimulated AC 16 cells, which were greatly attenuated by sST 2. Conclusions Serum levels of IL- 33, especially the full-length form, were elevated in CHF patients whereas IL- 33 bioactivity was reduced. In advanced CHF, IL- 33 may exert anti-oxidation effects, which may be overwhelmed by concurrently elevated levels of sST 2. </p...|$|R

50|$|Normal wound repair {{consists}} of three different phases: hemostasis and inflammation, proliferation and tissue remodeling. In disturbed wound healing, these stages cannot be completed often resulting in a reduced anatomical and functional outcome.Multiple factors determine the average healing time of the different phases.

In chronic wounds, factors as mentioned above, {{make it impossible for}} the tissue to regenerate properly. After injury, the extracellular matrix, and thereby also the heparan sulfate is broken down by different local enzymes, produced by macrophages such as, heparanases, serine proteases and metalloproteinases (MMPs). Heparan sulfate analogues replace the broken heparan sulfate at the wound site and bind to the free heparan sulfate binding sites of the extracellular matrix.

In early versions, the underlying circuitry controlled whether the white particles {{were at the}} top of the capsule (so it looked white to the viewer) or at the bottom of the capsule (so the viewer saw the color of the oil). This was essentially a reintroduction of the well-known electrophoretic display technology, but microcapsules meant the display could be made on flexible plastic sheets instead of glass.One early version of electronic paper consists of a sheet of very small transparent capsules, each about 40 micrometers across. Each capsule contains an oily solution containing black dye (the electronic ink), with numerous white titanium dioxide particles suspended within. The particles are <b>slightly</b> <b>negatively</b> charged, and each one is naturally white.The screen holds microcapsules in a layer of liquid polymer, sandwiched between two arrays of electrodes, the upper of which is transparent. The two arrays are aligned to divide the sheet into pixels, and each pixel corresponds to a pair of electrodes situated on either side of the sheet. The sheet is laminated with transparent plastic for protection, resulting in an overall thickness of 80 micrometers, or twice that of ordinary paper.The network of electrodes connects to display circuitry, which turns the electronic ink 'on' and 'off' at specific pixels by applying a voltage to specific electrode pairs. A negative charge to the surface electrode repels the particles to the bottom of local capsules, forcing the black dye to the surface and turning the pixel black. Reversing the voltage has the opposite effect. It forces the particles to the surface, turning the pixel white. A more recent implementation of this concept requires only one layer of electrodes beneath the microcapsules.|$|E

The sample was composed of 189 males and 84 females, all elite athletes involved in college and professional sports (primarily football, basketball, baseball, and volleyball). The subjects performed a series of 6 countermovement jumps on a force plate (500 Hz). Average eccentric rate of force development (ECC-RFD), total time (TIME), eccentric time (ECC-T), Ratio between eccentric and total time (ECC-T:T) and average force (CON-F) were extracted from force-time curves and the vertical jumping performance, measured by impulse momentum. Results show that CON-F (r = 0. 57; p < 0. 001) and ECC-RFD (r = 0. 52, p < 0. 001) are strongly correlated with the jump height (JH), whereas the time variables are <b>slightly</b> and <b>negatively</b> correlated (r = - 0. 21 - 0. 23, p < 0. 01). Force variables differ between both sexes (p < 0. 01), whereas time variables did not differ, showing a similar temporal structure. The best way to jump high is to increase CON-F and ECC-RFD thus minimizing the ECC-T. Principal component analysis (PCA) accounted for 76. 8 % of the JH variance and revealed that JH is predicted by a temporal and a force component. Furthermore, the PCA comparison made among athletes revealed sport-specific signatures: volleyball players revealed a temporal-prevailing profile, a weak-force with large ECC-T:T for basketball players and explosive and powerful profiles for football and baseball players...|$|R

Despite the lower water-solubility of phenanthrene, P. putida degraded this polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) at a maximum observed rate of 1. 4 ± 0. 1 mg Lˉ¹ hˉ¹, higher than the apparent degradation rate of fluorene, 0. 8 ± 0. 07 mg Lˉ¹ hˉ¹. The role of physiological processes on the biodegradation of these PAHs was analyzed and two different uptake strategies were identified. Zeta potential measurements revealed that phenanthrene-grown cells were <b>slightly</b> more <b>negatively</b> charged (– 57. 5 ± 4. 7 mV) than fluorene-grown cells (– 51. 6 ± 4. 9 mV), but much more negatively charged than glucose-grown cells (– 26. 8 ± 3. 3 mV), suggesting that the PAH substrate induced modifications on the physical properties of bacterial surfaces. Furthermore, protein-to-exopolysaccharide ratios detected during bacterial growth on phenanthrene were typical of biofilms developed under physicochemical stress conditions, caused by the presence of sparingly water-soluble chemicals as the sole carbon and energy source for growth, the maximum value for TP/EPS during growth on phenanthrene (1. 9) being lower than the one obtained with fluorene (5. 5). Finally, confocal laser microscopy observations using a gfp-labeled derivative strain revealed that, in the presence of phenanthrene, P. putida::gfp cells formed a biofilm on accessible crystal surfaces, whereas in the presence of fluorene the strain grew randomly between the crystal clusters. The results showed that P. putida was able to overcome the lower aqueous solubility of phenanthrene by adhering to the solid PAH throughout the production of extracellular polymeric substances, thus promoting the availability and uptake of such a hydrophobic compound.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. Recent {{research}} has {{emphasized the importance}} of understanding the consequences of species loss, not just for biodiversity per se, but also for ecosystem resilience and functioning. Firstly, a baseline analysis of the effects of a naturally patchy landscape on avian community composition and resilience in a high altitude Afrotemperate forest landscape in South Africa is presented. Bird data from a point count survey of 706 counts at 31 forest sites was used to test whether taxonomic species diversity, functional species richness and density of birds provide insight into community resilience in this historically patchy ecosystem. Bird species richness of forest patches ranged from 17 to 38, with a total species richness of 50. Density was <b>slightly</b> but <b>negatively</b> related to both area and species richness. That density compensation is occurring in these Afrotemperate forests suggests a level of resilience in this system. Following on from this, cumulative species-area and function-area graphs were derived to quantify the loss of forest area or taxonomic bird species richness that this landscape may potentially sustain before ecosystem functioning is negatively affected. The concept that species’ patterns of distribution, abundance and coexistence are the result of local ecological processes has recently been challenged by evidence that regionalscale processes are equally instrumental in shaping local community composition. The historically and naturally fragmented Afrotemperate forests of the uKhahlamba– Drakensberg Park, South Africa, offer an interesting test case. In this study the relative effects of local and regional-scale processes on species assemblages in a naturally patchy forest system were investigated. By employing species-area and species-isolation relationships, and nested subset analyses, we showed that isolation (regional-scale process) had a greater effect on bird species richness and composition than area (local-scale process), though the species-area relationship was significant. Using generalized linear models and an information-theoretic approach to model selection, patch area, the size of the regional species pool as well as the distance to the nearest Eastern Mistbelt forest were all influential in determining local bird species richness in these montane forests. Thus, localities are regionally enriched within the constraints on species occupancy provided by the available habitat...|$|R
30|$|Currently, the {{mechanisms}} of the Na-ion extraction from Na 3 V 2 (PO 4) 3 during charge processes in non-aqueous systems are still being debated. Gu, Xi, and Hu suggested Na 1 ions at the M 1 (6 b) sites tend to remain immobilized, only Na 2 ions at the M 2 (18 e) sites could be extracted, and the Na-ion extraction process involve a two-phase transformation from Na 3 V 2 (PO 4) 3 to NaV 2 (PO 4) 3 [12]. In contrast, Ji and Banks suggested that Na-ions at both sites could be extracted and the transformation from Na 3 V 2 (PO 4) 3 to NaV 2 (PO 4) 3 involve Na 2 V 2 (PO 4) 3 as an intermediate [25]. From the second scan to the fifth scan in repeated CV scanning (Fig.  4 a), should peaks near ~ 0.373  V showed up and the oxidation peaks at ~ 0.465  V are apparently broader than the reduction peaks at ~ 0.373  V (Fig.  4 a). All these observations suggest Na 2 V 2 (PO 4) 3 could serve as an intermediate in the two-step Na-ion insertion process but not the one-step Na-ion extraction process. Such difference indicates mechanisms or kinetics of Na-ion insertion and extractions differ, and similar phenomena in the metal-ion insertion and extraction in aqueous systems were observed before [26]. From the fifth scan to the tenth scan, the oxidation peaks shifted <b>negatively</b> <b>slightly</b> (~ 0.457  V for the tenth scan) while the reduction peaks at ~ 0.373  V shifted positively slightly (~ 0.390  V for the tenth scan), suggesting possible structural reorganization.|$|R
40|$|To develop tissue {{engineering}} strategies useful for repairing {{damage in the}} central nervous system (CNS) it is essential to design scaffolds that emulate the NSC niche and its tight control of neural cell genesis, growth, and differentiation. In this study we tested two types of poly l/dl lactic acid (PLA 95 / 5 and PLA 70 / 30), a biodegradable material permissive for neural cell adhesion and growth, as materials for nerve regeneration. Both PLA were <b>slightly</b> hydrophobic and <b>negatively</b> charged but differed in crystallinity, stiffness and degradation rate. PLA 95 / 5 films were highly crystalline, stiff (GPa), and did not degrade significantly in the one-month period analyzed in culture. In contrast, PLA 70 / 30 films were more amorphous, softer (MPa) and degraded faster, releasing significant amounts of lactate into the culture medium. PLA 70 / 30 performs better than PLA 95 / 5 for primary cortical neural cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation, maintaining the pools of neuronal and glial progenitor cells in vitro. l-lactate in the medium recapitulated PLA 70 / 30 's maintenance of neuronal restricted progenitors but did not sustain bipotential or glial restricted progenitors in the cultures, as occurred when neural cells were grown on PLA 70 / 30. Our results suggest that PLA 70 / 30 may mimic some of the physical and biochemical characteristics of the NSC niche. Its mechanical and surface properties may act synergistically in the modulation of bipotential and glial restricted progenitor phenotypes, while it is l-lactate, either added to the medium or released by the film that drives the maintenance of neuronal restricted progenitor cell phenotypes.
