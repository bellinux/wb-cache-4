50|$|The English statute Quia Emptores of Edward I (1290) {{established}} that <b>socage</b> <b>tenure</b> passed automatically {{from one generation}} to the next (unlike leases). As feudalism declined, the prevalence of <b>socage</b> <b>tenure</b> increased until it became the normal form of tenure in the Kingdom of England. In 1660, the Statute of Tenures ended the remaining forms of military service and all freehold tenures were converted into socage.|$|E
50|$|The {{holder of}} a soc or <b>socage</b> <b>tenure</b> was {{referred}} to as a socager (Anglo-Norman) or socman (Anglo-Saxon, also spelt sochman). In German-speaking Europe, the broad equivalent was a Dienstmann.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{abolition}} of gavelkind tenure by the Administration of Estates Act 1925, all land in Kent was {{presumed to be}} held by gavelkind until the contrary was proved. It was more correctly described as <b>socage</b> <b>tenure,</b> subject to the custom of gavelkind. The chief peculiarities of the custom were the following: ...|$|E
5000|$|The germ of {{the later}} {{distinction}} between [...] "grand" [...] (French: grand, [...] "large") and [...] "petty" [...] (French petit, [...] "small") serjeanty {{is found in the}} Magna Carta of 1215, the king there renouncing the right of prerogative wardship in the case of those who held of him by the render of small articles. The legal doctrine which developed that serjeanties were inalienable (i.e. non-transferrable) and impartible, led during the reign of King Henry III (1216-1272) to the arrentation of those serjeanties the lands of which had been partly alienated, which were thereby converted into <b>socage</b> <b>tenures</b> (i.e. paying money rents), or in some cases, tenures by knight-service. Gradually the gulf widened, and [...] "petty" [...] serjeanties, consisting of renders, together with serjeanties held of mesne lords, sank into socage, while [...] "grand" [...] serjeanties, the holders of which performed their service in person, became alone liable to the burden of wardship and marriage. In Littleton's Tenures (15th century), this distinction appears as well defined, but the development was one of legal theory.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{important}} {{difference between the}} military and <b>socage</b> <b>tenures</b> was the mode of descent. Whether or not a feudal benefice was originally hereditary, it had certainly become so {{at the time of the}} Conquest, and it descended to the eldest son. This applied at once in England to land held by knight-service as far as regarded the capital fief. The descent of socage lands or lands other than the capital fief for some time followed the old pre-Conquest rule of descent. Thus in the so-called [...] "Laws of Henry I" [...] The lands other than the capital fief and some socage lands were divided among all the sons equally. But by the time of Henry de Bracton the course of descent of lands held by knight-service had so far prevailed that, though it was a question of fact whether the land was partible or not, if there was no evidence either way descent to the eldest son was presumed. Relics of the old custom still remain in the case of gavelkind. The military tenant was subject to the feudal incidents, from which the tenant in socage was exempt. These additional fees and obligations were often oppressive. Alienation of lands by will, except in a few favoured districts, became impossible; alienation inter vivos was restrained in one direction in the interests of the heir, in another in the interests of the lord. At the time of Glanvill a tenant had a greater power of alienation over land which he had purchased than over land which he had inherited. But by the time of Bracton the heir had ceased to have any interest in either kind of land. The lords were more successful. It was enacted by Magna Carta that a free man should not give or sell so much of his land as to leave an amount insufficient to perform his services to his lord. In spite of this provision, the rights of the lords were continually diminished by subinfeudation until the passing of the Statute of Quia Emptores. Alienation by a tenant-in-chief of the crown without licence was a ground of forfeiture until 1327, when a fine was substituted.|$|R
50|$|While Lapley and Marston {{continued}} to be managed by the monks themselves, with lay assistance, the more distant estates were leased out. Hamstall Ridware gave the priors considerable trouble, as they {{became involved in the}} disputes of the family who held it. In 1242, for example, the death of Walter of Ridware led to disputes about his wife, Matilda's, dower and the prior was called to appear in court as a witness. It transpired that he had allowed the lord of the manor, Henry Mauvesyn, to take the disputed land into wardship. This {{turned out to be a}} serious mistake, as Matilda's claim was allowed, and the prior was forced to compensate Henry. Ridware was held by serjeanty - an arrangement by which the lessee had to perform certain services for his lord. In this case the tenant was expected to act as marshal at the priory over the Christmas period, from Christmas Eve to St Stephen's Day and to leave 5s. 4d. when he left after breakfast on 27 December. This was established around 1286,when the tenant Thomas, apparently disdaining such a humble service, claimed unsuccessfully that his father Walter had actually been seneschal of the priory lands and he had a <b>socage,</b> not serjeanty, <b>tenure.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Land {{was granted}} {{in return for}} various [...] "services" [...] and [...] "incidents". A service was an {{obligation}} {{on the part of}} the tenant owed to the landlord. The most important were payment of rent (<b>socage</b> <b>tenure),</b> military service (Knight-service), the performance of some form of religious service (frankalmoin) and personal/official service, including in times of war (serjeanty tenure).|$|E
5000|$|The {{feudal system}} in England {{gradually}} {{became more and}} more complex until eventually the process became cumbrous and services difficult to enforce. As a result, the statute of Quia Emptores was passed in 1290 to replace subinfeudation with substitution, so the subordinate tenant transferred their tenure rather than creating a new subordinate tenure. As tenancies came to an end, the number of layers in the feudal pyramid was reduced. The Tenures Abolition Act 1660 abolished knight service, converting all free tenures to <b>socage</b> <b>tenure.</b>|$|E
5000|$|At {{common law}} a {{feoffment}} in fee did not originally pass an {{estate in the}} sense in which the term is now understood. The purchaser took only a usufructary interest, without the power of alienation in prejudice of the lord. In default of heirs, the tenure became extinct and the land reverted to the lord. Under the system of English feudal tenures, all lands in the Kingdom, were supposed to be holden mediately or immediately of the King who was styled the [...] "lord paramount", or above all. Such tenants as held under the King immediately, when they granted out portions of their lands to inferior persons, also became lords with respect to those inferior persons, since they were still tenants with respect to the King, and thus partaking of a middle nature were called [...] "mesne" [...] or [...] "middle lords". So, if the King granted a manor to A and A granted a portion of the land to B, now B was said to hold of A, and A of the King; or in other words, B held his lands immediately of A and mediately of the King. The King was therefore styled [...] "Lord Paramount"; A was both tenant and lord, or a mesne lord, and B was called [...] "tenant paravail", or the lowest tenant. Out of the feudal tenures or holdings sprung certain rights and incidents, among those which were fealty and escheat. Both these were incidents of <b>socage</b> <b>tenure.</b> Fealty is the obligation of fidelty which the tenant owed to the lord. Escheat was the reversion of the estate on a grant in fee simple upon a failure of the heirs of the owner. Fealty was annexed to and attendant on the reversion. They were inseparable. These incidents of feudal tenure belonged to the lord of whome the lands were immediately holden, that is to say, to him of whom the owner for the time being purchased. These grants were called subinfeudations.|$|E
