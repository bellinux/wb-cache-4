40|$|Introduction In {{recent years}} {{due to lack}} of water {{resources}} in our country, planting of bare root seedlings of onion has been welcomed by farmers. Considering the desired high dense planting of Iranian farmers, lack of proper transplanting machine has appeared as the main problem. To overcome this problem, some researchers tested a few methods, but none of them reached to complete successfully. As the one of last efforts, Taki and Asadi (2012) developed a semi-automatic transplanting machine with 9 planting units. This machine requires to 9 men to separate and single out a bunch of seedlings. Usage of this machine is very time-consuming and labor intensive. In Iran, transplanting of bare root seedlings is practically performed by hand with a density of 700 - 800 thousand plants at hectare. The main {{purpose of this study was}} designed, manufacture, and evaluation of an automatic metering device that with the separation and singulars of bare root seedlings of onion could get a high density planting. Materials and Methods Fig. 1 shows the main employed idea of this research for separation and single out a bunch of seedlings. As shown in Fig. 1, the metering device consisted of two carrying and separating belts with different teeth forms. Placing seedling bunches between the two belts, the belts move at different speeds in opposite directions and separate seedlings from their bunch. For proper design of metering device system, measurement of some physical properties were necessary. The obtained information was used to select two belts form. A belt with flexible plastic teethes with a height of 6 mm and the distance of 4 mm was selected as separator while for carrier, two types of belts were selected: the first was the same as a separator and the second was made of metal teethes. Based on the average thickness of seedling bunch and some pre-tests, the horizontal angle of <b>separator</b> <b>belt</b> determined as α= 20 degrees. Theoretical calculations were done to computatingof the needed force of the system. In this section, seedlings were modeled as some solid cylinders with a length of 200 and a diameter of 10 mm. In the mentioned system, it was necessary that the speed of <b>separator</b> <b>belt</b> is more than the speed of carrier belt. Thus, ratio of two linear velocities () of 1. 67 and 2. 32 were considered for evaluation of the system. For evaluation of manufactured metering device, the effects of three factors, i. e., carrier belt type, ratio of linear velocities of the belts, and number of seedlings in a bunch (n = 30 and n = 60), on qualitative planting parameters were studied in a factorial experiment based on completely randomized design with three replications. The studied qualitative planting parameters were miss index, consumed seedlings, miss length, quality of feed index, multiple index, mean, and damaged seedlings. Results and Discussion The results of analysis of variance showed that, except of belt type, effects of the two studied factors and all interactions are statistically non-significant on consumed seedlings and miss length indexes. The results indicated significant differences between miss index (P< 0. 01), multiple index (P< 0. 05), and mean (P< 0. 05) as affected by belt type. None of the studied variable had a significant effect on damaged seedlings. Interactions of belt type and ratio of linear velocities significantly affected the quality of feed index (P < 0. 01). An increase in ratio of linear velocities in plastic toothed belt lead to decrease of mean and miss indexes, whereas in case of metal toothed belt there is no significant effect on this two indexes. The results also showed that increase of linear velocities for the two types of carrier belt lead to increase of consumed seedlings and decrease of miss length. At the two ratios of linear velocities, miss length in metal toothed is less than plastic toothed belt. Conclusions Commercial transplanting machines are not suitable for dense planting of onion. In this research an automatic metering device for separation and singularize of bare root seedlings of onion was manufactured and evaluated. The results indicated that the carrier belt with long and rigid teeth, having an angle of attack, could separate seedlings more efficiently. The results also showed a 80 percent increased in uniformity of plant seedlings distances is reachable using the metering system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paperdeals {{with the}} {{separation}} of oil from refinery industries, sugar factories and many small scale industries {{to find out the}} better solution for oil recovery from the water surface to produce oil free water. Also a deal with the fabrication of mechanical equipment to separate oil from the water. Oil and water separator is mechanical equipment, which is used in the environment pollution control from oil spillage. Oil separator helps in removing the oily from the waste water. By removing the oil from waste water, it becomes free of oil pollution. This is mainly due to oleophilic material used in the oil separator. This oil separator can be used in the effluent treatment plant. This project consists of construction, fabrication details, assembly, working and applications of oil and water <b>separator.</b> The <b>belt</b> speed, oil recovery rate and oil recovery efficiency are the operating parameters of oil separator. The oil recovery rate and the oil recovery efficiency, the two most important parameters displayed the performance of the oil separator...|$|R
40|$|Different {{types of}} dry high {{intensity}} magnetic separators {{are applied to}} remove the iron bearing contaminants from two nepheline syenite samples. Ding’s cross <b>belt</b> <b>separator</b> was applied in this study as a “pick up ” separator, while “Carpco ” induced roll was employed as a free fall kind of separator, that is widely used with dry sand size materials. Magnaroll magnetic separator, the latest design by Boxmag Rapid that uses rare earth permanent magnets for high intensity magnetic separation, was also applied. The main parameters affecting the separation efficiency of these machines were studied. It was found that Magnaroll separator was of high performance, {{as compared with the}} other separators. It was possible to produce clean concentrates containing 0. 24 % and 0. 28 % iron oxide from original samples containing 6. 0 % and 5. 3 % Fe 2 O 3, respectively. These products are acceptable as glass grade materials in amber glass and fiberglass industries, as well as for ceramic purposes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAfter {{removing}} frozen {{sea buckthorn}} berries from {{the branches of}} sea buckthorn tree in a separator (patent EE 05717 B 1), the berries fall onto <b>separator's</b> moving conveyer <b>belt</b> under a certain angle of inclination, thus guiding the berries in the collector of separator. This paper presents the mathematical model of the berry motion along the conveyer and after falling from it. The nonlinear differential equations describing the berry motion on the conveyer and after falling from it take into account air resistance depending on the square value of berry's absolute velocity. All these equations were solved numerically by using Runge-Kutta method of 4 th order on Mathcad worksheet. This paper focuses on berry motion depending on belt velocity, friction coefficient between belt and berry, and inclination angle of the belt. Composed video clip visualizes berry motion and demonstrates how the berry moves from the initial position {{in the same direction}} as conveyer belt velocity, down to lower edge of the belt and falls from conveyer. Results of this paper can be used by engineers designing conveyors and by educators teaching agricultural machinery...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSeparation Technologies, LLC (ST) has {{developed}} a processing system based on triboelectric charging and electrostatic separation that provides the mineral processing industry a means to beneficiate fine materials with an entirely dry technology. The environmentally friendly technology can eliminate wet processing and required drying of the final material. The process requires little if any pre-treatment of the material other than grinding and operates at high capacity – up to 40 tonnes per hour by a compact machine. Energy consumption is low, approximately 1 kWh/tonnes of material processed. Since the only potential emission of the process is dust, permitting is typically relatively easy. In contrast to the other available electrostatic separation processes that are typically limited to particles greater than 75 μm in size, the ST <b>belt</b> <b>separator</b> is ideally suited for separation of very fine (< 1 μm) to moderately coarse (300 μm) materials with very high throughputs. The triboelectric particle charging is effective {{for a wide range}} of materials and only requires particle – particle contact. The small gap, high electric field, counter current flow, vigorous particle-particle agitation and self-cleaning action of the belt on the electrodes are the critical features of the ST separator. The high efficiency multi-stage separation through charging / recharging and internal recycle results in far superior separations and is effective on fine materials that cannot be separated at all by conventional electrostatic techniques. Since 1995, this triboelectric technology has been extensively used for the beneficiation of coal fly ash with eighteen separators in place and over 130 machine-years of operation at locations in North America and Europe. The technology has been also successfully applied to the beneficiation of a variety of minerals including calcium carbonates, talc, and potash. Recently, dry electrostatic separation has been successfully demonstrated for beneficiation of phosphate ores...|$|R
