40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} extending the analysis techniques developed for P/T systems to a proper subclass of P/T systems with inhibitor arcs. We start proposing {{an extension of the}} coverability tree construction to a subclass of P/T systems with inhibitor arcs, whose elements will be called henceforth <b>primitive</b> <b>systems.</b> We show that the coverability tree corresponding to a <b>primitive</b> <b>system</b> is finite and is a good representation of its behaviour; hence, it can be used as an analysis tool to check properties such as place boundedness, the existence of dead transitions and of a reachable marking larger than a given one. Then we provide an encoding of <b>primitive</b> <b>systems</b> in P/T systems, which permits to retrieve the firing sequences of the <b>primitive</b> <b>system</b> from the firing sequences of the corresponding P/T system. The close correspondence between the firing sequences of the two systems is used prove the decidability of reachability, deadlock and liveness for <b>primitive</b> <b>systems.</b> We also obtain that the model checking problem for the linear time μ-calculus and labelled <b>primitive</b> <b>systems</b> is decidable. We show that <b>primitive</b> <b>systems</b> coincide with the largest class of P/T systems with inhibitor arcs whose transition sequences can be simulated by a standard P/T system; we also show that in general the step behaviour of a <b>primitive</b> <b>system</b> cannot be simulated by any P/T system.

There is an unmet {{need in the}} {{treatment}} of pediatric brain tumors for chemotherapy that is efficacious, avoids dam-age to the developing brain, and crosses the blood-brain barrier. These experiments evaluated the efficacy of cabazitaxel in mouse models of pediatric brain tumors. Methods. The antitumor activity of cabazitaxel and docetaxel were compared in flank and orthotopic xenograft models of patient-derived atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT), medulloblastoma, and central nervous <b>system</b> <b>primitive</b> neuroectodermal tumor (CNS-PNET). Efficacy of cabazitaxel and docetaxel were also assessed in the Smo/Smo spontaneous mouse medulloblastoma tumor model. Results. This study observed significant tumor growth inhibition in pediatric patient-derived flank xenograft tumor models of ATRT, medulloblastoma, and CNS-PNET after treatment with either cabazitaxel or docetaxel. Cabazitaxel, but not docetaxel, treatment resulted in sustained tumor growth inhibition in the ATRTandmedulloblastoma flank xenograft models. Patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models of ATRT, medulloblastoma, and CNS-PNET showed significantly improved survival with treatment of cabazitaxel. Conclusion.

40|$|The {{description}} of a skull of the omomyid primate Omomys carteri from the middle Eocene Bridger Formation of southwestern Wyoming provides important new information relevant {{to our understanding of}} Eocene primate systematics and evolution. More specifically, Omomys carteri exhibits a long and wide nasal region and lacks the forward orientation of the orbits found in other omomyid primates. Furthermore, other features such as an unreduced cranial arterial <b>system,</b> <b>primitive</b> auditory bulla, expanded internal choanae, and an unreduced canine indicate that the cranium of Omomys carteri is primitive. Phylogenetic analysis of 52 cranial, 194 dental, and 56 postcranial characters, including the new characteristics of Omomys carteri discussed here, suggests that omomyiforms belong to a monophyletic tarsiiform clade exclusive of anthropoids. Anthropoids are still viewed as a sister group to tarsiiforms, forming a haplorhine clade, with an uncertain position for the problematic fossil primate Rooneyia.

METHODS AND MATERIALS After surgery, children received hyperfractionated radiation therapy (36 Gy to the craniospinal axis, 68 Gy to the tumor region, and 72 Gy to any residual tumor, fractionated at 2 × 1 Gy per day 5 days per week) accompanied by weekly intravenous administration of vincristine and followed by 8 cycles of maintenance chemotherapy (lomustine, cisplatin, and vincristine). RESULTS Twenty-six patients (15 with CNS-PNET; 11 with pinealoblastoma) were included. Median age at diagnosis was 11. 5 years old (range, 4. 0 - 20. 7 years). Gross total tumor resection was achieved in 6 and partial resection in 16 patients (indistinct, 4 patients). Median follow-up of the 15 surviving patients was 7. 0 years (range, 5. 2 - 10. 0 years).

40|$|Although {{brain tumors}} are {{classified}} and treated {{based upon their}} histology, the molecular factors involved {{in the development of}} various tumor types remain unknown. In this study, we show that the type and order of genetic events directs the development of gliomas, central nervous <b>system</b> <b>primitive</b> neuroectodermal tumors, and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid-like tumors from postnatal mouse neural stem/progenitor cells (NSC/NPC). We found that the overexpression of specific genes {{led to the development of}} these three different brain tumors from NSC/NPCs, and manipulation of the order of genetic events was able to convert one established tumor type into another. In addition, loss of the nuclear chromatin-remodeling factor SMARCB 1 in rhabdoid tumors led to increased phosphorylation of eIF 2 α, a central cytoplasmic unfolded protein response (UPR) component, suggesting a role for the UPR in these tumors. Consistent with this, application of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib led to an increase in apoptosis of human cells with reduced SMARCB 1 levels. Taken together, our findings indicate that the order of genetic events determines the phenotypes of brain tumors derived from a common precursor cell pool, and suggest that the UPR may represent a therapeutic target in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors.

From the mass spectrum, the ratio of compound formation of ULAA was analyzed. Thermal strength of the grown crystal has been studied using thermo-gravimetric (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA).
