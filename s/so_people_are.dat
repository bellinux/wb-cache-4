25|$|Social {{motivation}} {{is tied to}} one's activity in a group. It cannot form from a single mind alone. For example, bowling alone is naught but the dull act of throwing a ball into pins, and <b>so</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> {{much less likely to}} smile during the activity alone, even upon getting a strike because their satisfaction or dissatisfaction {{does not need to be}} communicated, and so it is internalized. However, when with a group, people are more inclined to smile regardless of their results because it acts as a positive communication that is beneficial for pleasurable interaction and teamwork. Thus the act of bowling becomes a social activity as opposed to a dull action because it becomes an exercise in interaction, competition, team building, and sportsmanship. It is because of this phenomenon that studies have shown that people are more intrigued in performing mundane activities so long as there is company because it provides the opportunity to interact in one way or another, be it for bonding, amusement, collaboration, or alternative perspectives. Examples of activities that may one may not be motivated to do alone but could be done with others for social benefit are things such as throwing and catching a baseball with a friend, making funny faces with children, building a treehouse, and performing a debate.|$|E
500|$|On July 8, 2014, Stauskas {{signed a}} rookie scale {{contract}} with the Sacramento Kings. During the 2014 NBA Summer League Stauskas was a starting member of the Summer League Champions. In the 2014–15 NBA.com Rookie Survey at the annual Rookie Photo Shoot on August 6, Stauskas was named by his peers as the second best shooter in the Rookie class behind Doug McDermott. During his rookie pre-season, he {{got a lot of}} publicity for the statement [...] "I understand that I’m a rookie and I’m white, <b>so</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> going to attack me" [...] because of stereotypes about race and his unproven and presumably weak defensive skills. Stauskas was surprised by the attention the statement received. In his first week in the league, he had a 3-block game against the Los Angeles Clippers. On December 8 in his first game against Utah and former teammate and fellow Big Ten Player of the Year Burke, Stauskas posted career highs of 15 points and 8 rebounds. Stauskas again posted 15 points against the New York Knicks and former Michigan teammate Hardaway on March 3. On March 24, he received the nickname [...] "Sauce Castillo" [...] via social media after a closed captioning error. Stauskas started in the Kings' April 15 season finale against the Los Angeles Lakers and tallied 5 assists. It was his first and only start of the season.|$|E

We have a heightened awareness of what needs to happen every night <b>so</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> as safe as they can possibly be." [...] Vedder started both concerts with an emotional plea to the crowd to look after each other. He commented during the Leeds set that the band's decision to play a festival for the first time after Roskilde {{had nothing to do with}} [...] "guts" [...] but with trust in the audience. On September 19, 2006, at the Torino, Italy show at Palaisozaki, Pearl Jam played Pearl Jam in its entirety in order midway through its set. After Europe, the band headed to Australia and then finished the year with two shows in Hawaii. The official bootlegs on this tour were available only in digital form, in both MP3 and lossless FLAC formats.
