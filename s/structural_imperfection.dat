The crystalline imperfections, caused by lattice disorder, directly affect the impurity scattering between the π and σ bands of MgB 2, resulting in a larger upper critical field. In addition, low sintering temperature keeps the grain size small, which leads to a strong enhancement of pinning, and thereby, enhanced critical current density. Owing to both the impurity scattering and the grain boundary pinning, the critical current density, irreversibility field, and upper critical field are enhanced.

In this paper, there is a study of the way the resistance fatigue ASTM A- 36 is made among two environments: refrigerated and immerged into water at 5 atm hydrostatic pressure through bending tension fatigue tests. After that, some analyses and comparative results with the tested material were carried out. For this study, a mechanism was developed to test fatigue for bending tension to be used inside and outside hyperbaric chamber for the hydrostatic pressure simulation. This study is worth because any resistance confirmation does not exist in immerged fatigue of virgin materials; in other words, all the tests of fatigue were or have being accomplished in materials done in the air. Curves S-N were determined for each atmosphere. The methodology used for verification of resistance to the fatigue was the regression model from a data originated from accelerated life tests and it was possible to verify the environment influence in the phenomenon of the fatigue.
