40|$|Immaturity of the {{pulmonary}} <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>material</b> synthesizing {{system with}} deficiency of <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>material</b> in the premature lung is an accepted cause of hyaline membrane disease. Lamellar bodies, the intracellular form of <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>material,</b> are produced and secreted from Type II pneumocytes and converted to tubular myelin in the alveolar lumen. Tubular myelin, in turn, {{gives rise to}} the surface monolayer, which has the greatest surface active property. Thus, lung sections were studied by light and electron microscopy from 35 infants who died of histologically confirmed hyaline membrane disease and 19 infants who died of other causes. Tubular myelin was not identified ultrastructurally in lungs of infants who died of hyaline membrane disease, despite the presence of abundant lamellar bodies. In contrast, 16 of 19 infants dying of other causes had easily identifiable tubular myelin in addition to lamellar bodies. The absence of tubular myelin in the hyaline membrane disease patients suggests an abnormality in the conversion of lamellar bodies to tubular myelin. The authors speculate that this abnormal lamellar body turnover may be important in the pathogenesis of hyaline membrane disease...|$|E

This phosphatase is quite specific for the hydrolysis of phosphatidic acid and 1 -acyl- 2 -lysophosphatidic acid. The enzyme possesses {{many of the}} characteristics of the microsomal enzyme, phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (EC 3. 1. 3. 4). In addition, we have shown that this enzyme will also convert phosphatidylglycerol phosphate [1 -(3 -sn-phosphatidyl) -sn-glycerol- 1 -P] to phosphatidylglycerol [1 -(3 -sn-phosphatidyl) -sn-glycerol] and Pi. The phosphatidylglycerol phosphate was made available to the surfactant enzyme in a coupled assay by hydrolysis of cardiolipin [1 -(3 -sn-phosphatidyl) - 3 -(3 -sn-phosphatidyl) -sn-glycerol] by stereospecific cleavage with phospholipase C (phosphatidylcholine cholinephosphohydrolase, EC 3. 1. 4. 3) from Bacillus cereus.

30|$|When the {{salinity}} reduces, {{two opposing}} phenomena take place, salting-in and interface polarization. The competition {{between these two}} phenomena dictates the interaction response at the interface. At 2 -TDSW, the ionic strength of the brine affects the adsorption of asphaltene molecules at the interface due to the polarization of the interface. Moreover, other <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>materials</b> diffuse toward the interface to occupy the surface sites. The accumulation of all <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> agents at the interface leads to lower IFT values compared to the cases of brines with other salinities.

The data certainly provides preliminary indications rather than quantitative analysis. According to Kokal (2005), the droplet size distribution influences the viscosity of the emulsion, that is, the emulsions are more viscous when the droplets are of smaller size and also when the distribution is more compact and with more uniform droplet sizes. Thus, increased stability {{can be attributed to}} the high viscosities found in emulsions with small droplet sizes, making the demulsification process difficult.|$|R

However, certain physical properties of the lung which depend on the presence of a surface active alveolar lining were normal.

It is suggested that though the production of <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>material</b> in the pneumocyte is controlled at least in part by fetal adrenocortical hormones, the extrusion of this material into the alveolar space may be subject to other control.

40|$|Historically, Kurt von Neergaard was {{the first}} to suggest that surface tension plays an {{important}} role in lung elasticity. He showed, in 1929, that the pressure necessary for fIlling the lung with liquid was less than half the pressure necessary for filling the lung WiOl air, and concluded that two-thirds to three-fourths of the elasticity of the lung was derived from interfacial forces. The problem with his discovery was that this paper was published in Gemlan and that, for 25 years, no scientists in the evolving fIeld really took note of this pnblication. In 1954, Macklin described the presence of a thin aqueous mucoid microfIlm, formed from secretion of the granular pneumocytes, on the pnlmonary alveolar walls and which is in constant slow movement toward the phagocytic pneumocytes and bronchioles. One year later, Pattie noticed the remarkable stability of foam and bubbles from lung edema and healthy lung cut. He assumed that the walls of these bubbles consists of surface-active material which must lower the surface tension to nearly zero. In 1957, Clements [was the fIrst to prove the direct evidence of <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>material</b> in the lungs. He measured surface tension of a surface fIlm derived from the lung by using a Wilhelmy balance and demonstrated that the surface tension was not a constant value; when the surface was stretched the tension was relatively high (40 dynes/cm), but when the surface area was decreased the tension fell to 10 dynes/cm. He pointed out that such a reduction in surface tension during deflation in the lung would tend to stabilize the air spaces by permitting them to remain open at low lung volumes. Two years later, Avery and Mead demonstrated that lung extracts of very small premature infants and infants dying with hyaline membrane disease had much higher surface tension than normal lung extracts, due to a defIciency in <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>material.</b> This {{was the first}} step towards extensive research on the surfactant system, and Fujiwara and colleagues, in 1980, were the fIrst to treat premature babies suffering from respiratory insufficiency with exogenous surfactant...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} {{by several}} groups have uncovered a novel fingering {{instability in the}} spreading of <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>material</b> on a thin liquid film. The mechanism responsible for this instability {{is yet to be}} determined. In an effort to understand this phenomenon and isolate a possible mechanism, we have investigated the linear stability of a coupled set of equations describing the Marangoni spreading of a surfactant monolayer on a thin liquid support. The unperturbed flows, which exhibit simple linear behavior in the film thickness and surfactant concentration, are self-similar solutions of the first kind for spreading in a rectilinear geometry. The solution of the disturbance equations determines that the rectilinear base flows are linearly stable. An energy analysis reveals why these base flows can successfully heal perturbations of all wavenumbers. The details of this analysis suggest, however, a mechanism by which the spreading can be destabilized. We propose how the inclusion of additional forces acting on the surfactant coated spreading film might give rise to regions of adverse mobility gradients known to produce fingering instabilities in other fluid flows...|$|E

Thus, the interaction between macroscopic mercury droplets was proved to be essentially the same as that between submicroscopic hydrophobic particles in these cases, providing at the same time the most direct proof of the theory. For solutions, however, in which ionic or nonionic surface active materials were added in addition to the supporting inorganic electrolyte, no coalescence occurred even at the zero polarization for <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>material</b> concentrations higher than certain values, i. e. a perfect stabilization took place. These critical concentrations were found to depend on the HLB values of the surface active materials added; the stabilizing power increased with increasing hydrophilic property of the molecule.
