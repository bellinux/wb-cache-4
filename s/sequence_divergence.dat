40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} vicariance and dispersal on New Zealand's estuarine biodiversity, we examined variability in mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequences for the amphipod genus Paracorophium. Individuals from the two nominate endemic species (Paracorophium excavatum and Paracorophium lucasi) were collected from sites throughout the North and South Islands. <b>Sequence</b> <b>divergences</b> of 12. 8 % were detected among the species. However, divergences of up to 11. 7 % were also observed between well supported clades, suggesting the possibility of cryptic species. Nested clade analyses identified four distinct lineages from within both P. excavatum and P. lucasi, with boundaries between clades corresponding to topographical features (e. g. Cook Straight, North and East Cape). <b>Sequence</b> <b>divergences</b> of 3. 7 – 4. 9 % were also observed within geographic regions (e. g. east and west coasts of the upper North Island).

On the basis of molecular clock estimates from <b>sequence</b> <b>divergences</b> and reconstructions of New Zealand's geological past, we suggest that sea level and landmass changes during the early Pleistocene (2 Mya) resulted in the isolation of previously contiguous populations leading to the present-day patterns.

40|$|Background: The State of Bavaria is {{involved}} in a research program that will lead to the construction of a DNA barcode library for all animal species within its territorial boundaries. The present study provides a comprehensive DNA barcode library for the Geometridae, one of the most diverse of insect families. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study reports DNA barcodes for 400 Bavarian geometrid species, 98 per cent of the known fauna, and approximately one per cent of all Bavarian animal species. Although 98. 5 % of these species possess diagnostic barcode sequences in Bavaria, records from neighbouring countries suggest that species-level resolution may be compromised in up to 3. 5 % of cases. All taxa which apparently share barcodes are discussed in detail. One case of modest divergence (1. 4 %) revealed a species overlooked by the current taxonomic system: Eupithecia goossensiata Mabille, 1869 stat. n. is raised from synonymy with Eupithecia absinthiata (Clerck, 1759) to species rank.

40|$|Background: Because many picoplanktonic {{eukaryotic}} species cannot currently {{be maintained}} in culture, direct sequencing of PCR-amplified 18 S ribosomal gene DNA fragments from filtered sea-water {{has been successfully}} used to investigate the astounding diversity of these organisms. The recognition of many novel planktonic organisms is thus based solely on their 18 S rDNA sequence. However, a species delimited by its 18 S rDNA sequence might contain many cryptic species, which are highly differentiated in their protein coding sequences. Principal Findings: Here, we investigate the issue of species identification from one gene to the whole genome sequence. Using 52 whole genome DNA sequences, we estimated the global genetic divergence in protein coding genes between organisms from different lineages and compared this to their ribosomal gene <b>sequence</b> <b>divergences.</b> We show that this relationship between proteome divergence and 18 S divergence is lineage dependant. Unicellular lineages have especially low 18 S divergences relative to their protein <b>sequence</b> <b>divergences,</b> suggesting that 18 S ribosomal genes are too conservative to assess planktonic eukaryotic diversity. We provide an explanation for this lineage dependency, which suggests that most species with large effective population sizes will show far less divergence in 18 S than protein coding sequences.

Although the study of their diversity currently represents a major challenge, DNA barcodes may provide a functional, standardized tool for their identification. To evaluate this possibility, we performed the first comprehensive test {{of the effectiveness of}} DNA barcodes as a tool for beetle identification by sequencing the COI barcode region from 1872 North European species. We examined intraspecific divergences, identification success and the effects of sample size on variation observed within and between species. A high proportion (98. 3 %) of these species possessed distinctive barcode sequence arrays.

A 2008 study comparing sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b and D-loop markers found two distinct, unrelated groups within the supposed M.manavi from the Comoros; both groups were also found on Madagascar.
