40|$|A direct {{approach}} {{to reduce the}} thermal noise contribution to the sensitivity limit of a GW interferometric detector is the cryogenic cooling of the mirrors and mirrors suspensions. Future generations of detectors are foreseen to implement this solution. Silicon has been proposed as a candidate material, thanks to its very low intrinsic loss angle at low temperatures and due to its very high thermal conductivity, allowing the heat deposited in the mirrors by high power lasers to be eciently extracted. To accomplish such a scheme, both mirror masses and suspension elements must be made of silicon, then bonded together forming a quasi-monolithic stage. Elements can be assembled using hydroxide-catalysis <b>silicate</b> <b>bonding,</b> as for silica monolithic joints. The eect of Si to Si bonding on suspension thermal conductance has therefore to be experimentally studied.

It is already known that plasma treated PDMS films forms very thin SiO 2 layer on its surface. Due to difference in {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of the surface SiO 2 and the remaining bulk layer, the SiO 2 layer develops cracks. These formations are explored to characterize PDMS surface by observing intensity of scattered light while the films are stretched. Pristine PDMS films do not show such optical scattering. Further the intensity measurements were repeated over period of time to monitor surface properties with time. It was observed that plasma treated PDMS film; the scattered light intensity is linearly dependent on the applied force for stretching. After a substantial time, scattering intensity is reduced to the value which is almost equal to that of pristine PDMS surface. It is proposed that basic light scattering through plasma treated PDMS occurs due to the decrease in the width of the cracks when the PDMS film is stretched. The change in the scattering property of plasma treated PDMS surface over time could be attributed to healing of cracks by the migration of polymer chain molecules from the bulk to the surface. It is also reported that with reference to various bonds present on surface plasma treated PDMS surface regains its original properties as that of pristine PDMS with time. Therefore the optical technique could be employed to study surface characteristics of PDMS surface as an alternative approach to conventional spectroscopic techniques.

40|$|Using geopolymers as bonding {{materials}} {{could be}} an alternative solution to the concrete repair. This study reports the effects of phase changes on the bonding property of geopolymer to hydrated cement. A geopolymer binder was prepared by activation of heated kaolin with sodium <b>silicate</b> solution, <b>bonded</b> with 28 days aged cement paste and cured under different conditions. The experimental results demonstrated that under the 20 C air curing conditions, the bond strength achieved 1. 3 MPa at 7 days and increased to 1. 5 MPa at 28 days. While under the 80 C steam and water curing conditions, the bond strength decreased by 31 % and 37 % respectively. The XRD, FTIR and SEM analysis of the geopolymers and hydrated cement pastes show that the strength loss is due to two factors: (1) the increased porosity in cement paste due to the water loss and/or crystallization of C-S-Hs; and (2) the mineralogical change (crystallization) in geopolymer binder which becomes more ordered structures. The increased porosity and the crystallization either in cement or geopolymer generate local stress and weak regions at the interface.

40|$|During the {{refining}} {{of steel}} by basic processes, {{a multitude of}} mineralogical reactions {{take place in the}} refractories with which the furnace is lined. The reactions are caused by an influx of material from the slag and are a function of the composition of the slag and of the refractory. The flow of material from the slag into the refractory resembles the process of metasomatism encountered in nature. The reactions between slags of different composition and magnesiteand chromite-containing refractories could be studied systematically {{as a result of a}} series of four experiments. During each of the experiments four different refractories were subjected to the influence of a slag having a specific composition for a considerable length of time. The experiments were conducted in a rotating furnace at 1700 ° 0 ~ Mineralogical reactions in the refractories used in these experiments can be divided into two main categories, viz. reactions involving the oxides and reactions involving the silicates. The relevant oxides are periclase, the sesquioxides and spinel. Periclase is found to Mndergo reactions like grain growth, resorption and elongation normal to the hot face of the refractory. These reactions are dependent on the composition of the refractory and of the metasomatised components. Reaction between periclase and sesquioxides yield spinel, provided there is no excess of lime. Exsolution of bodies of spinel from periclase is governed by the crystal-chemistry of both minerals. At elevated temperature, spinel, and more specifically chromite, acts as a source of sesquioxides in general, and of ferric oxide in particular. The stability of chromite depends on the molecular ratio between lime and silica of both the refractory and the slag. This ratio determines the amount of sesquioxides present, but not in spinel or in periclase, i. e. in the matrix of the refractory. The postulation of the reactions involving the silicates is possible because of the tendency of the refractory to reach equilibrium with the composition of the slag. The silicates present in acid slags are not in equilibrium with magnesia in the refractory, and consequent reaction yields the minerals monticellite and merwinite. These minerals are not in equilibrium with the <b>bonding</b> <b>silicates</b> of magnesite refractories which have high molecular lime/silica ratios and also not with the <b>bonding</b> <b>silicates</b> of chromite- containing refractories having ver. y low molecular lime/silica ratios. Reaction between metasomatic and autochthonous silicates result in a new set of silicates. The silicates present in basic slags are in equilibrium with magnesia of the refractories as well as with the <b>bonding</b> <b>silicates</b> of magnesite refractories having high molecular lime/silica ratios. Consequently, no reaction results. Reaction does, however, take place between the silicates supplied by basic slags and the <b>bonding</b> <b>silicates</b> of chromite- containing refractories. Ultrabasic slags react mildly with magnesite and drastically with chrome-magnesite bricks. The reason is that in the former reaction, only monticellite and merwinite are not in equilibrium with the composition of the melt, but these minerals have a relatively high mobility, and migrate de~per into the refractory. In chromite-containing refractories, however, neither of the minerals chromite, monticellite or forsterite are in equilibrium with the composition of the slag. Reaction results in the formation of an association of minerals in the area of contact between the slag and the refractory which differs completely from the original minerals of the refractory. The conclusion arrived at is that chromite has a beneficial influence on refractories used in contact with less basic slags, because of the textural superiority of chromite-containing refractories over magnesite refractories. In contact with basic slags, however, metasomatism leads to the formation of components which have low melting points and low viscosities. During the refining of steel by basic processes, ultrabasic slags are preferred and magnesite refractories having high molecular lime/silica ratios are better suited for use in contact with the liquid slag.

In the spectrum of Fo, strong Si-O- symmetric stretching bands appear at 824 and 855 cm^- 1, and a medium intensity anti-symmetric Si-O- stretching band appears at 964 cm^- 1 These bands show a systematic frequency variation with composition and are attributed to decreased distortion of SiO 4 tetrahedra.

The thermal analysis of the chrysocolla from Congo shows mass losses at 125, 275. 3, 805. 6 and 877. 4 ◦C and for the Nevada chrysocolla, mass loss steps at 268, 333, 463, 786. 0 and 817. 7 ◦C are observed. The thermal analysis of spertiniite is very different from that of chrysocolla and thermally decomposes at around 160 ◦C. XPS shows that there are two different copper species present, one which is bonded to oxygen and one to a hydroxyl unit. The O 1 s is broad and very symmetrical suggesting two O species of equal number. The bond energy of 102. 9 eV for the Si 2 p suggests that it {{is in the form of}} a <b>silicate.</b> The <b>bond</b> energy is much higher for silicas around ∼ 103. 5 eV. The reported value for silica gel has Si 2 p at 103. 4 eV. The combination of TG, PXRD, EDX and XPS adds to our fundamental knowledge of the structure of chrysocolla...|$|R

The results are compared with the spectral features for conventional silica nanotubes (SNT) and amorphous silica. Bands peculiar to organic moieties have been detected and assigned. Assignment of the silicate backbone vibrations {{was based on the}} results of normal coordinate calculations. Furthermore, characteristic silicate, so-called ‘nanotube’ vibrations have been identified and their band positions have been summarized to serve as a future reference for such compounds. SiOSi antisymmetric stretchings were observed in the range 1000 - 1110 cm- 1, while the symmetric stretchings appeared between 760 - 960 cm- 1 for EtSNT, ESNT and Br-ESNT. Force constants have been refined for models of the repeating structure units: O 3 SiOSi(OSi) 3 for SNT and SiCHnCHnSi(OSi) 3 for organosilica nanotubes (n = 2, EtSNT; n = 1, ESNT and n = 0, ASNT). The calculated SiO stretching force constants were increased from 4. 79 to 4. 88 and 5. 11 Ncm- 1 for EtSNT, ESNT and ASNT, respectively.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{explores the}} interaction of the fibrous silicates, palygorskite, sepiolite and chrysotile {{with a wide range of}} organic agents. Infrared spectroscopy (IR) methods are essential for the characterization of solid surfaces and for the investigation of the kind of bonds formed between the surface of these silicates and the organic moieties. Thus, when sepiolite or palygorskite are treated e. g. with polyurethanes, isocyanates, amines or pyridines, specific Si-NH-C or Si-O-C bonds are derived from the linkage of the differently located OH groups in these fibrous silicates with the organic moieties. On the other hand, more stable, covalent Si-O-Si-C bondings are formed when the fibrous silicates, especially chrysotile, are reacted with heterofunctional silylating agents like chlorosilanes or ethoxysilanes carrying, alkyl, alkenyl or aryl groups. Such reactions may occur in presence or absence of HCl. An absorption band at 960 cm- 1 -which we assigned to Si-OH groups- is detected only in presence of HCl. The evolution of this band is related to the degree of grafting of the organic radicals with the silanol groups of the silicates. HClgenerated silanol groups are the main bridges for the coupling of organosilyl groups on chrysotile and other <b>silicates</b> by covalent <b>bonding,</b> leading the way to the preparation of interesting new materials, including fibrous sheet polymers...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} a {{substantial}} practical interest in the in vitro bioactivity of calcium silicate phosphate (CSP) glass-ceramics and carbonate apatite (CO 3 HA) formation on their surfaces after in vitro test in simulated body fluid (SBF). The main purpose of the presented article is the evaluation of the chemical composition of the gel with nominal composition 70. 59 CaO: 28. 23 SiO 2 : 1. 18 P 2 O 5 (mol. %) on the structure, crystallization behaviour and in vitro bioactivity in SBF solution for 14 and 28 days. The prepared glass-ceramics have been synthesized via a polystep sol-gel method. The structure of the obtaining samples was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). After thermal treatment of the samples XRD confirmed the presence of -Ca 2 SiO 4 and Ca 15 (PO 4) 2 (SiO 4) 6, and indicated that at 1500 °C Ca 15 (PO 4) 2 (SiO 4) 6 becomes predominant phase. FTIR revealed the presence of all characteristics bands for calcium <b>silicate</b> phosphate (CSP) <b>bonds.</b> SEM monitors the presence of particles with different morphology. After in vitro test in SBF, FTIR depicted that B-type carbonate containing hydroxyapatite (CO 3 HA) is preferentially formed on the immersed glass-ceramics. SEMof the precipitated layers showed the presence of HA spheres. The changes in SBF solution after soaking the samples were recorded by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to determine the}} interactions between root filling materials and root dentin and to investigate if root canal irrigating solutions had an impact on these interactions. The following outcomes were assessed in the studies encompassed in this thesis: (i) dislocation resistance of an epoxy resin based root canal sealer and tricalcium silicate based root canal sealers, (ii) the influence of irrigation protocols on the sealing ability and chemical interactions with dentin of an epoxy resin based sealer, (iii) retreatability of mineral trioxide aggregate based sealers, (iv) characterization of a mineral trioxide aggregate based sealer following exposure to irrigation regimens. The results showed that irrigation protocols diﬀerentially influenced the sealer materials. The use of continuous chelation (sodium hypochlorite + etidronic acid) enhanced the bond strength of epoxy resin as well as mineral trioxide aggregate based sealers. This irrigation regimen also positively influenced the hydration characteristics of the tricalcium <b>silicate</b> materials. The <b>bond</b> strength of tricalcium silicate sealers improved with time. The epoxy resin sealer AH Plus chemically bonds to root dentin and irrigation protocols employing a final rinse of a proteolytic irrigant reduced the bond strength. Use of a final rinse of EDTA after continuous chelation significantly improved the bond strength of the epoxy resin sealer. Retreatability of mineral trioxide aggregate based sealers depends on the composition of the material with sealers containing a resin component being easily removable than compositions with without a resin...|$|R

It is necessary, depending on the objectives of restoration and finishing of a monument {{of architecture}} and its damages and defects, to select appropriate technologies and materials. Mineral substances as fillers, and inorganic (mineral) colouring pigments, along with liquid potassium glass form an ultrastrong combination of materials. It gives to paints made of these mineral substances, an extremely high weather resistance and durability. The functional concept of silicate paints {{is the ability to}} silicify with other mineral construction materials. Silicate paints are the only colouring system which enters into chemical compound with the base due to the liquid potassium <b>silicate</b> properties.

40|$|This {{study is}} related to the {{question}} of the long%term behaviour of the high%level activity nuclear waste confinement glass. In contact with water, a hydrated amorphous silica layer, known as the “gel” is formed at the glass surface. This gel results from the departure of the most soluble elements and from the mechanisms of hydrolysis and recondensation of the <b>silicate</b> (siloxane ?) <b>bonds.</b> In certain conditions, the gel can limit the exchanges between the glass and the solution. Our hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is the closure of the gel pores. This thesis actually presents an original insight into silicate glass alteration, usually described by chemical thermodynamic considerations, and highlights the impact of morphologic transformations in the glass alteration layer on the slowing down of the leaching kinetics. Since the composition of the actual nuclear waste glasses is too complex to isolate the influence of one specific element on the global leaching kinetics, it is preferable to use simpler glasses. Consequently, we studied five oxide based glasses SiO 2 %B 2 O 3 %Na 2 O%CaO%ZrO 2. They correspond to the different categories of nuclear glass components, and can be classified according to their reactivity with water as soluble (B, Na), partially soluble (Si, Ca) and insoluble (Zr). Two series of glasses were synthesized by substituting CaO for Na 2 O on the one hand and ZrO 2 for SiO 2 on the other hand. In the first place, we looked into the calcium and zirconium specific impacts on the leaching kinetics. The substitution of sodium for calcium was found to improve the reticulation of the vitreous network, inducing a decrease in the final degree of corrosion. Concerning zirconium, we observed that it prevents the dissolution of nearby silicon, which leads to a decrease of the initial dissolution rate. However, the presence of this insoluble element delays the drop of the alteration rate and leads paradoxically to an increase in the alteration degree. In order to explain this unexpected behaviour, the glass alteration layer morphology was investigated by small%angle X%ray scattering. These experiments highlighted the restructuring of porous network during the glass alteration process and showed that the restructuring is limited by the increase of the zirconia content. This suggests that the restructuring of the glass alteration layer is at the origin of the major drop in the alteration rate observed for the low zirconia content glasses. Besides, this hypothesis has been demonstrated with various experimental techniques. Both time%of%flight secondary%ion mass spectroscopy (TOF%SIMS) that provides an evaluation of dye penetration into the gel pores and neutron scattering with index matching by exchange of H 2 O%D 2 O mixture showed that the porosity closed during the course of corrosion in the glass without zirconia, but remained open in the high zirconia%content glasses. These experiments, associated to numerical simulations at mesoscopic scale by a Monte Carlo method, clearly establish a relationship between the gel morphology and alteration kinetics for these series of simplified glasses simulating the nuclear glass composition. Cette étude s'inscrit dans la problématique du comportement à long terme des verres de confinement des déchets nucléaires. La couche d'altération formée lors de l'altération du verre par l'eau, appelée gel, peut limiter les échanges entre le verre et la solution. Les verres étudiés sont du type SiO 2 -B 2 O 3 -Na 2 O-CaO-ZrO 2. Deux séries de verres ont été synthétisées en substituant CaO à Na 2 O et ZrO 2 à SiO 2. Les altérations ont montré que le calcium améliore la réticulation du réseau vitreux, aboutissant à une diminution du degré final d'altération et que la présence de Zr limite l'hydrolyse du silicium, conduisant à une diminution des vitesses initiales de dissolution. En revanche, le zirconium a aussi pour effet de retarder la chute de vitesse d'altération et conduit à une augmentation du degré d'altération. Afin d'expliquer cet effet paradoxal, la morphologie des gels a été sondée par diffusion des rayons X aux petits angles. Ces expériences montrent que la réorganisation du réseau poreux du gel au cours de l'altération est limitée par la présence de Zr. La restructuration du gel est donc à l'origine de la forte chute de vitesse d'altération observée dans les verres à faible teneur en ZrO 2. De plus, le suivi d'éléments étrangers dans le gel par spectrométrie de masse (TOF-SIMS) et l'expérience de diffusion de neutrons avec variation de contraste ont montré que la porosité se fermait au cours de l'altération dans le verre sans ZrO 2, alors qu'elle restait ouverte dans les verres aux fortes teneurs en ZrO 2. Ces expériences, couplées avec des simulations de type Monte Carlo, établissent un lien entre les transformations morphologiques du gel et la cinétique d'altération...|$|R
