The development of <b>Sanger’s</b> <b>enzymatic</b> dideoxy and Maxam and Gilbert’s chemical degradation DNA sequencing protocols in 1977 opened doors to the genomic era. The first full DNA genome to be sequenced was that of bacteriophage φX 174 in 1977. Starting from gel based sequencing of DNA fragments that was detected by autoradiography, sequencing technologies advanced to automation through capillary electrophoresis and detection of fluorescent dyes by a CCD camera. High throughput analysis of 96 samples in one go was made possible with machines like the ABI Prism 3770 based on these first generation sequencing technologies making true the dream of human genome sequencing. The first complete genome sequenced was the 1, 830, 137 bases circular chromosome of the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae based on whole-genome shotgun sequencing. This strategy was used to produce a draft sequence of the human genome. Amongst the plants, genomes of Arabidopsis, rice, sorghum, grapes, soybean and poplar have been sequenced on this platform. The high cost and sequencing time associated with the first generation sequencing technology however were a limitation to extending this list beyond a limited few.

Here we screened several highly destabilizing analogs of G and C for one {{that could be used}} with 2 -aminoadenine (nA) and 2 -thiothymine (sT) to generate structure-free DNA that is fully accessible to complementary probes. The analogs, which included bioactive bases such as 6 -thioguanine (sG), 5 -nitrocytosine (NitroC), 2 -pyrimidinone (P; the free base of zebularine) and 6 -methylfuranopyrimidinone (MefP), were prepared as dNTPs and evaluated as substrates for T 7 and Phi 29 DNA polymerases that lacked editor function. Pairing properties of the analogs were characterized by solution hybridization assays using modified oligonucleotides or primer extension products. P and MeP did not support robust primer extension whereas sG and NitroC did. In hybridization assays, however, sG lacked discrimination and NitroC paired too strongly to C. The dNTPs of two other base analogs, 7 -nitro- 7 -deazahypoxanthine (NitrocH) and 2 -thiocytosine (sC), exhibited the greatest promise.

Different protocols for viral enrichment, library preparation and sequencing have increasingly been more available and at lower costs. However, no study to date has focused on optimization of viral sample preparation for commercial deep sequencing. Accordingly, the aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate an In-House <b>enzymatic</b> <b>protocol</b> for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) synthesis and also compare the use of a commercially available kit protocol (Nextera XT, Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA) and its combination with a library quantitation kit (Kapa, Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA) for deep sequencing (Illumina Miseq). Two RNA viruses (canine distemper virus and dengue virus) and one ssDNA virus (porcine circovirus type 2) were tested with the optimized protocols. The tested method for dsDNA synthesis has shown satisfactory results and may be used in laboratory setting, particularly when enzymes are already available. Library preparation combining commercial kits (Nextera XT and Kapa) has yielded more reads and genome coverage, probably due to a lack of small fragment recovering at the normalization step of Nextera XT. In addition, libraries may be diluted or concentrated to provide increase on genome coverage with Kapa quantitation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

For mixed enzymatic-explant, 1 cm 3 pieces WJ were placed in enzymatic cocktail comprising 4 mg/ml Collagenase Type I and 1 mg/ml Hyaluronidase and 0. 1 % trypsin-EDTA. Then isolated cells were analyzed for surface cell markers such as CD 73, CD 31. Isolated 1. 0 × 10 6 MSCs/ml were encapsulated in alginate hydrogel.

Nonetheless, nucleic acids are known to electrostatically bind to ceramics, a class of materials commonly employed in orthopaedic implants and bone tissue engineering scaffolds. This phenomenon is expected {{to lead to a}} relevant underestimation of the DNA amount, resulting in erroneous experimental readouts. The present work aims at (i) investigating the effects of DNA-ceramic bond occurrence on DNA quantification, and (ii) developing a method to reliably extract and accurately quantify DNA in ceramic-containing specimens.

Chelidonium is a homeopathic drug routinely used against various liver disorders including cancer in humans. Two potencies of Chelidonium (Ch- 30, Ch- 200) have been tested for their possible anti-tumor and enzyme modulating activities in liver and anti-clastogenic effects during p-DAB-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in mice compared to suitable controls. Methods Several cytogenetic and <b>enzymatic</b> <b>protocols</b> were used at three fixation intervals; at 60 days, 90 days and 120 days of treatment. Different sets of healthy mice were fed: i) hepatocarcinogen, p-DAB plus phenobarbital (PB), ii) only PB, iii) neither p-DAB nor PB (normal control). One set of mice fed with p-DAB plus PB was also fed Ch- 30 (iv) and another set Ch- 200 (v). All standard currently used methods were adopted for cytogenetical preparations and for the enzyme assays. Results All group (i) mice developed tumors in liver at all fixation intervals, while none of group (ii) and (iii) mice developed any tumors.

However, to understand the real effect of xenobiotics on organisms, it is important to investigate how certain factors can interfere with enzyme activity. We investigated the effects of different temperatures, food stress and two steps of the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>protocol</b> on the activity of AChE, EST-α and EST-β in Chironomus sancticaroli. In experiment of thermal stress individuals from the egg stage to the fourth larval instar were exposed to different temperatures (20, 25 and 30 °C). In food stress experiment, larvae were reared until IV instar in a standard setting (25 °C and 0. 9 g weekly ration), but from fourth instar on they were divided into groups and offered different feeding regimes (24, 48 and 72 h with/without food). In sample freezing experiment, a group of samples was processed immediately after homogenization and another after freezing for 30 days. To test the effect of centrifugation on samples, enzyme activity was quantified from centrifuged and non-centrifuged samples. The activity of each enzyme reached an optimum at a different temperature. The absence of food triggered different changes in enzyme activity depending on the period of starvation. Freezing and centrifugation of the samples significantly reduced the activity of three enzymes. Based on these results we conclude that the four factors studied had an influence on AChE, EST-α and EST-β and this influence should be considered in ecotoxicological approaches...|$|R

These oil-in-water emulsions were compared with conventional milk (whey protein isolate, WPI, and sodium caseinate, SCn) protein-stabilized emulsions in terms of their lipid digestion kinetics using an in vitro <b>enzymatic</b> <b>protocol.</b> The kinetics of fatty acid release were evaluated as well as the change in oil droplet size of the respective emulsions during lipid digestion. The interfacial pressure was measured by addition of the duodenal components using drop tensiometry and the electrical charge of the oil droplets was also assessed, in an attempt to relate the interfacial properties with the stability of the emulsions towards lipolysis. Lipid hydrolysis in the ChN-stabilized emulsion was appreciably slower and the plateau values of the total concentration of fatty acids released were much lower, compared to the WPI- and SCn-stabilized emulsions. Moreover, the ChN-stabilized emulsions were relatively stable to coalescence during lipid digestion, whereas the WPI- and SCn-stabilized emulsions exhibited a significant increase in their droplet size. On the other hand, no major differences were shown among the different emulsion samples in terms of their interfacial properties. The increased stability of the ChN-stabilized emulsions towards lipolysis could be attributed to several underlying mechanisms: (i) strong and irreversible adsorption of the chitin nanocrystals at the interface that might inhibit an extensive displacement of the solid particles by bile salts and lipase, (ii) network formation by the nanocrystals in the bulk (continuous) phase that may reduce lipid digestion kinetics, and (iii) the ability of chitin, and consequently of ChNs, to impair pancreatic lipase activity. The finding that ChNs can be used to impede lipid digestion may have important implications for the design and fabrication of structured emulsions with controlled lipid digestibility that could provide the basis for the development of novel products that may promote satiety, reduce caloric intake and combat obesity...|$|R

Oligosaccharide mapping of individual glycosylation sites revealed that hormone-specific glycosylation was primarily restricted to Asn 56 of both subunit preparations and revealed a hormone-specific pattern of Asn 56 glycosylation in eFSH alpha that was obscured in the total oligosaccharide map. eLH alpha Asn 56 oligosaccharides appeared to be primarily seven variants of a monoantennary structure. eCG alpha Asn 56 oligosaccharides consisted of one of two forms, either a sialylated biantennary oligosaccharide that appeared identical to a commercial carbohydrate standard or a lactosamine variant of that structure.

40|$|The {{umbilical}} cord (UC) represents {{an important source}} of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). These human UC-derived MSC (UC-MSC) have already been isolated using a protocol based on the migratory and plastic adhesive properties of MSC (UC-MSC-Mig). The UC-MSC-Mig isolation method, however, is difficult to standardize. Therefore, we developed an <b>enzymatic</b> isolation <b>protocol</b> (UC-MSC-Enz) to overcome the above mentioned disadvantages. First, we investigated the UC-MSC-Enz for their MSC properties. We found that UC-MSC-Enz express the MSC markers CD 73, CD 90 and CD 105 and are able to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondroblasts fulfilling the MSC criteria of the International Society for Cellular Therapy. Previously we found that UC-MSC-Mig are unique among MSCs due to their significant expression of several hepatic (progenitor) markers. Therefore, we also investigated the expression of hepatic transcription factors and other hepatic markers in UC-MSC-Enz at both the mRNA and protein level. We found that the expression of hepatic transcription factors (GATA 4, GATA 6, SOX 9 and SOX 17) and hepatic markers (AFP, DPP 4, CX 43, DKK 1, DSG 2, KRT 18 and KRT 19) in UC-MSC-Enz was not significantly different from those of UC-MSC-Mig. Consequently, this optimized enzyme-based method represents a fast, robust and standardized way to isolate UC-MSC for a broad range of applications.

40|$|Polyethylene wear {{particles}} {{have been the}} main culprit in initiating osteolysis and aseptic failure of conventional metal-polyethylene total hip arthroplasties. There has been a revived interest in metal-metal (MM) bearings, made of CoCrMo alloys; because of their very high wear resistance compared with conventional bearings. The work that forms {{the basis of this}} thesis attempts to examine MM bearings as one potential {{solution to the problem of}} osteolysis. The results provide important new information on MM particle characteristics and their effects on tissue, as well as the effects of their corrosion products (Co 2 + and Cr 3 +) on macrophage response in vitro. An <b>enzymatic</b> <b>protocol</b> for isolation and characterization of metal particles was first developed in order to minimize particle changes due to the reagents. Metal particles isolated from a hip simulator and from human tissues around MM implants using this protocol were found to be mainly round to oval and more occasionally needle-shaped, extremely small (∼ 50 nm), and surprisingly, mostly chromium oxides. In vitro and in vivo run-in wear periods did not exactly correlate, but MM {{wear particles}} from both sources were quite similar at specific periods of comparison. Alloy composition and number of running cycles in vitro influenced the overall characteristics of the particles, although the observed differences were relatively small and would probably not induce a difference in the biological response. Tissue response to metal wear particles revealed the presence of IL- 1 beta and IL- 6, two major inflammatory mediators implicated in periprosthetic osteolysis. There was also a high correlation between the amount of these cytokines and the quantity of metal particles. The amounts of cytokines decreased when the quantities of particles increased, most likely due to the high toxicity of the metal particles when present in larger quantities. There was more IL- 6 than IL- 1 beta and TNF-alpha remained at low levels. Apoptosis was clearly observed in some tissues from the patients analyzed, but results were highly variable depending on the tissues analyzed. More patients would be necessary to complete this study on apoptosis. In vitro, Co 2 + and Cr 3 + ions induced the secretion of TNF-alpha, another major inflammatory mediator implicated in periprosthetic osteolysis, and macrophage mortality in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Co 2 + was more toxic than Cr 3 +. Macrophage apoptosis was predominant at 24 h with both ions, and with the lowest concentrations at 48 h. Necrosis was more prevalent with the highest concentrations at 48 h. The implication of caspase- 3 pathway was also identified in macrophage apoptosis. These results suggest how specific therapeutic treatments could modulate macrophage response to these ions...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} {{high-density}} gene array technology has revolutionized approaches to drug design, development, and characterization. At the laboratory level, the efficient, consistent, and dependable exploitation of this complex technology requires the stringent standardization of protocols and data analysis platforms. The Affymetrix YE 6100 expression GeneChip platform was evaluated for its {{performance in the}} analysis of both global (6, 000 yeast genes) and targeted (three pleiotropic multidrug resistance genes of the ATP binding cassette transporter family) gene expression in a heterologous yeast model system in the presence and absence of the antimalarial drug chloroquine. Critical to the generation of consistent data from this platform are issues involving the preparation of the specimen, use of appropriate controls, accurate assessment of experiment variance, strict adherence to optimized <b>enzymatic</b> and hybridization <b>protocols,</b> and use of sophisticated bioinformatics tools for data analysis...|$|R
40|$|Massive {{sequencing}} {{has transformed}} the field of genome biology due to the continuous introduction and evolution of new methods. In recent years, the technologies available to read through genomes have undergone an unprecedented rate of development in terms of cost-reduction. Generating sequence data has essentially {{ceased to be a}} bottleneck for analyzing genomes instead to be replaced by limitations in sample preparation and data analysis. In this work, new strategies are presented to increase both the throughput of library generation prior to sequencing, and the informational content of libraries to aid post-sequencing data processing. The protocols developed aim to enable new possibilities for genome research concerning project scale and sequence complexity. The first two papers that underpin this thesis deal with scaling library production by means of automation. Automated library preparation is first described for the 454 sequencing system based on a generic solid-phase polyethylene-glycol precipitation protocol for automated DNA handling. This {{was one of the first}} descriptions of automated sample handling for producing next generation sequencing libraries, and substantially improved sample throughput. Building on these results, the use of a double precipitation strategy to replace the manual agarose gel excision step for Illumina sequencing is presented. This protocol considerably improved the scalability of library construction for Illumina sequencing. The third and fourth papers present advanced strategies for library tagging in order to multiplex the information available in each library. First, a dual tagging strategy for massive sequencing is described in which two sets of tags are added to a library to trace back the origins of up to 4992 amplicons using 122 tags. The tagging strategy takes advantage of the previously automated pipeline and was used for the simultaneous sequencing of 3700 amplicons. Following that, an <b>enzymatic</b> <b>protocol</b> was developed to degrade long range PCR-amplicons and forming triple-tagged libraries containing information of sample origin, clonal origin and local positioning for the short-read sequences. Through tagging, this protocol makes it possible to analyze a longer continuous sequence region than would be possible based on the read length of the sequencing system alone. The fifth study investigates commonly used enzymes for constructing libraries for massive sequencing. We analyze restriction enzymes capable of digesting unknown sequences located some distance from their recognition sequence. Some of these enzymes have previously been extensively used for massive nucleic acid analysis. In this first high throughput study of such enzymes, we investigated their restriction specificity in terms of the distance from the recognition site and their sequence dependence. The phenomenon of slippage is characterized and shown to vary significantly between enzymes. The results obtained should favor future <b>protocol</b> development and <b>enzymatic</b> understanding. Through these papers, this work aspire to aid the development of methods for massive sequencing in terms of scale, quality and knowledge; thereby contributing to the general applicability of the new paradigm of sequencing instruments.
