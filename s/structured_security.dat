50|$|In June 1975, the Director Military Occupational Structures (DMOS) {{issued a}} draft {{occupational}} analysis {{report on the}} Sec 81 classification {{in which it was}} found that the activities performed by Sec(Int) officers bore little resemblance to those performed by Sec(MP) officers. The Branch was restructured into two classifications vice the five sub-classifications that existed at the time. By August 1975 after another review, DGIS rejected the idea of two separate classifications within one Security Branch and proposed one classification for Police and one for Intelligence. After 1976, training and employment of Security Branch Officers was in consonance with the dual structure of the Branch and proved superior to the pre-1975 approaches. The dual structure also formalized and clearly defined the uniqueness of the Police and Intelligence functions and institutionalized the security function in the police side of the structure as had been the RCAF practice. In 1978, the Craven Report, proposed that ADM(PER) separate the CF Police and Intelligence personnel comprising the unified Security Branch and reorganize them independently into a <b>structured</b> <b>Security</b> Branch and a new Intelligence Branch. Following further studies, discussions and recommendations, DGIS concurred with the CRAVEN Report and on 3 December 1981 the CDS directed that separate Security and Intelligence Branches each containing the applicable officer classification and trade be established, with an implementation target date of 1 October 1982. On 29 October 1982, a ceremony was held at the Canadian Forces School of Intelligence and Security (CFSIS) which inaugurated the new Intelligence Branch and rededicated the Security Branch.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTraditionally, a {{security}} policy is defined from an informal set of requirements, generally written using natural language.

We chose the goal-oriented methodology KAOS to express the functional objectives, then based on the results of a risk analysis, we integrate the security objectives to the obtained KAOS framework.

40|$|Automatic {{security}} protocol analysis is currently feasible only for small protocols.

To illustrate the applicability of our framework to real-world protocols, we study a key establishment sequence in WiMax consisting of three subprotocols.

Empirical analysis of two distinct samples of commercial mortgage-backed securitiesissuances supports many of the model predictions, including the relative efficiency of junior security control over the special servicer and the value enhancing properties of specific governance mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Matemática FinanceiraThe {{financial}} market turmoil of 2007 and 2008 {{was the most}} severe recession seen after the Great Depression. The economic momentum, previous to the crisis, created a strong demand for AAA securities that was not available on single bond market. This motivated arrangers to issue high volumes of structured finance securities, collateralized by subprime Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities. Most of the AAA investors based their choices uniquely based on Credit Rating Agencies' assessment that taken into account Probabilities of Default or Expected Losses but mispriced the Systematic Risk. This fact created arbitrage opportunities for Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) and ABS Collateralized Debt Obligations (ABS CDO) arrangers. They exploited it by issuing securities {{with high levels of}} Systematic Risk. In this work I run ABS and ABS CDO simulations to exemplify how these instruments were structured to explore these features. To quantify the extent of the mispricing I compare a <b>structured</b> <b>security</b> with a single bond with the same rating.

With private phone conversations being conducted on insecure public networks, security of VoIP communications is increasingly important. We present a <b>structured</b> <b>security</b> analysis of the VoIP protocol stack, which consists of signaling (SIP), session description (SDP), key establishment (SDES, MIKEY, and ZRTP) and secure media transport (SRTP) protocols. Using a combination of manual and tool-supported formal analysis, we uncover several design flaws and attacks, {{most of which are}} caused by subtle inconsistencies between the assumptions that protocols at different layers of the VoIP stack make about each other. The most serious attack is a replay attack on SDES, which causes SRTP to repeat the keystream used for media encryption, thus completely breaking transport-layer security. We also demonstrate a man-in-the-middle attack on ZRTP, which allows the attacker to convince the communicating parties that they have lost their shared secret. If they are using VoIP devices without displays and thus cannot execute the “human authentication ” procedure, they are forced to communicate insecurely, or not communicate at all, i. e., this becomes a denial of service attack. Finally, we show that the key derivation process used in MIKEY cannot be used to prove security of the derived key in the standard cryptographic model for secure key exchange. ...|$|E

40|$|Although {{a lot of}} {{work and}} {{proposals}} are currently in place to help mitigate vulnerabilities, but unfortunately vulnerabilities double up each year. With the current high growth in software security breaches, this work aim to provide a thorough discussion on vulnerability and the response of software vendors to it, with emphasis on patch availability and reliability. In recent years, there has been a massive shift in vulnerability trends and exploit from the commonly known sewer exploitation to client applications exploits such as web browsers, backup sofiware, antivirus, media player and flash. This has constituted to the continuous rise in the vulnerability listings each year. Despite vendors' effort in making a workable solution "Batches" available for these vulnerabilities, the issue is: Are these patches readily available to end-users? And if yes, how reliable are the patches? This work presents the result from the examination of data from various databases in order to investigate vendors' response to vulnerabilities. To ascertain this, data on vulnerability reports were collated on 9 different vendors over a period of 5 years. Analysis was focused on comparing the total patched to the un-patched vulnerabilities disclosed yearly by each of these vendors. The study reveals the consistent growth in vulnerability despite the various tools developed to help mitigate them. While some vendors are more vulnerable than others, it was realized that not all of them have a <b>structured</b> <b>security</b> approach to vulnerability mitigation process. For the few ones in place, it takes so much time for them to make a patch available to users and such delay had contributed to the wide spread of vulnerabilities and its increasing number. Furthermore, when a patch {{is supposed to be a}} solution, it sometimes constitutes more ham than good. This work highlights some potential problems such as incompatibility, complexity, faulty and unavailability of patches. There is need for vendors to simplify patchesas much as they can and also make it available to all end-users not limiting it to just licensed users as vulnerability spread do not have limitations. Also end-users can contribute to reducing vulnerability growth by using the recommended security tools to safeguard themselves from exploits and manage patching processFaculty of Technolog...|$|E

40|$|Web {{applications}} {{are becoming more}} and more popular in means of modern information interaction, which leads to a growth of the demand of Web applications. At the same time, Web application vulnerabilities are drastically increasing. This will inevitably expose more Web application users to malicious attacks, causing them to lose valuable information or be harmed in other ways. One of the most important software security practices that is used to mitigate the increasing number of vulnerabilities is security testing. The most commonly applied security testing methodologies today are extensive and are sometimes too complicated with their many activities and phases. Because of this complexity, developers very often tend to neglect the security testing process. Today, there is only a few security testing methodologies developed especially for Web applications and their agile development environment. It is therefore necessary to give attention to security testing methodologies for Web applications. A survey of state-of-the-art security testing methodologies for Web applications is performed. Based on some predefined criterions, Agile Security Testing is selected as the most adequate security testing methodology for Web applications, and is further extended to support all the predefined criterions. Furthermore, the extended Agile Security Testing methodology (EAST) is integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle applied by the Administrative Information Services group at the Department of General Infrastructure Services at CERN−The European Organization for Nuclear Research. Finally, by using the EAST methodology and the security testing methodology applied by the AIS group (which is an ad hoc way of performing security tests), an evaluation of the EAST methodology compared to existing ad hoc ways of performing security tests is made. The security testing process is carried out two times using the EAST methodology and two times using the ad hoc approach. In total, 9 vulnerability classes are tested. The factors that are used to measure the efficiency is: (1) the amount of time spent on the security testing process, (2) the amount of vulnerabilities found during the security testing process and (3) the ability to mitigate false-positives during the security testing process. The results show that the EAST methodology is approximately 21 % more effective in average regarding time spent, approximately 95 % more effective regarding the amount of vulnerabilities found, and has the ability to mitigate false-positives, compared to existing ad hoc ways of performing security tests. These results show that <b>structured</b> <b>security</b> testing of Web applications is possible not being too complicated with many activities and phases. Furthermore, it mitigates three important factors that are used as basis to neglect the security testing process. These factors are: The complexity of the testing process, the too time-consuming attitude against security testing of Web applications and that it s considered to lack a significant payoff. </p...|$|E
