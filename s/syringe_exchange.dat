2500|$|As {{a result}} of [...] "spillover" [...] along the US-bound drug {{trafficking}} routes and more stringent border enforcement, Mexico's Northern Border states have seen increased levels of drug consumption and abuse, including elevated rates of drug injection 10 to 15 times the national average. These rates are accompanied by mounting rates of HIV and STIs among injection drug users (IDUs) and sex workers, reaching a 5.5% prevalence {{in cities such as}} Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez, which also report STI rates of 64% and 83%, respectively. Violence and extortion of IDUs and sex workers directly and indirectly elevate the levels of risk behavior and poor health outcomes among members of these groups. Marginalization of these vulnerable groups by way of physical and sexual violence and extortion by police threatens the cross-over of infection from high-prevalence groups to the general population. In particular, decreased access to public health services, such as <b>syringe</b> <b>exchange</b> programs, and confiscation of syringes, even in view of syringe access and possession being legal, can precipitate a cascade of health harms. Geographic diffusion of epidemics from the Northern Border states elsewhere is also possible with the rotation of police and military personnel stationed in drug conflict areas with high infection prevalence.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the allocation of resources within a multi-site needle exchange program (NEP) that achieves the largest possible reduction in new HIV infections at minimum cost. We present a model that relates the number of injection drug user (IDU) clients and the number of <b>syringes</b> <b>exchanged</b> per client to both the costs of the NEP and the expected reduction in HIV infections per unit time. We show that cost-effective allocation within a multi-site NEP requires that sites be located where the density of IDUs is highest, and that the number of <b>syringes</b> <b>exchanged</b> per client be equal across sites. We apply these optimal allocation rules to a specific multi-site needle exchange program, Prevention Point Philadelphia (PPP). This NEP, we find, needs to add 2 or 3 new sites in neighborhoods with the highest density of IDU AIDS cases, and to increase its total IDU client base by about 28 %, from approximately 6400 to 8200 IDU clients. The case-study NEP also needs to increase its hours of operation at two existing sites, where the number of needles distributed per client is currently sub-optimal, by 50 %. At the optimal allocation, the estimated cost per case of HIV averted would be $ 2800 (range $ 2300 -$ 4200). Such a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio derives primarily from PPP's low marginal costs per distributed needle. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

This paper reviews data on the prevalence and incidence of HCV, and the methods used to generate such information, among injecting drug users (IDUs), in Scotland. The prevalence estimate for HCV among IDUs in Scotland as a whole (44 % in 2000), is comparable with those observed in many European countries.

40|$|Background We {{aimed to}} assess audio-computer-assisted self-interviewing (audio-CASI) {{as a method}} of {{reducing}} under-reporting of HIV risk behaviour among injecting drug users. Methods Injecting drug users were interviewed at syringe-exchange programmes in four US cities. Potential respondents were randomly selected from participants in the <b>syringe</b> <b>exchanges,</b> with weekly alternate assignment to either traditional face-to-face interviews or audio-CASI. The questionnaire included items on sociodemographic characteristics, drug use, and HIV risk behaviours for 30 days preceding the interview. We calculated odds ratios for the difference in reporting of HIV risk behaviours between interview methods. Findings 757 respondents were interviewed face-to-face, and 724 were interviewed by audio-CASI. More respondents reported HIV risk behaviours and other sensitive behaviours in audio-CASI than in face-to-face interviews (odds ratios for reporting of rented or bought used injection equipment in audio-CASI vs face-to-face interview 2 · 1 [95 % CI 1 · 4 – 3 · 3] p= 0 · 001; for injection with borrowed used injection equipment 1 · 5 [1 · 1 – 2 · 2] p= 0 · 02; for renting or selling used equipment 2 · 3 [1 · 3 – 4 · 0] p= 0 · 003). Interpretation Although validation of these self-reported behaviours was not possible, we propose that audio-CASI enables substantially more complete reporting of HIV risk behaviour.

40|$|Intravenous {{drug users}} are {{frequently}} exposed to parenterally transmitted viral infections, and these infections can {{spread to the}} general population through sexual activity. We investigated the prevalence of serologic markers for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I/II (HTLV-I/II), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in intravenous drug users and their sexual contacts. Of 585 drug users from northern California tested for these serologic markers, 72 % were reactive for the antibody to HCV, 71 % for the antibody to hepatitis B core antigen, 12 % for HTLV-I/II antibodies, and 1 % for the HIV- 1 antibody. The prevalence of serologic markers for these four viruses correlated with the duration of intravenous drug use, the ethnic group, and the drug of choice. More than 85 % of subjects infected with either HCV or HBV were coinfected with the other virus. All persons reactive to HTLV-I/II antibodies had antibodies for either HBV or HCV. Of 81 sexual contacts tested, 17 % had evidence of HBV infection while only 6 % were reactive for HTLV-I/II antibodies and 4 % for the antibody to HCV. None of this group was infected with HIV- 1. We conclude that HTLV-I/II and HCV are inefficiently transmitted to sexual contacts while HBV is spread more readily.

METHODS: Among the 100, 000 <b>syringes</b> <b>exchanged</b> annually by the ABS foundation (Accueil Bas Seuil), 113 were collected following a purposive sampling method and analysed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). RESULTS: Four syringes (4 % of the sample population) contained no substances take into consideration the limit of the method. Cocaine was the most commonly observed compound and was detected in 77 syringes (68 %), whilst users reported syringes with cocaine among those analysed in this study. Heroin was detected in 49 syringes (43 %) and reported by 53 users returning syringes; midazolam was detected in 31 syringes (27 %) and reported as the medicine Dormicum(®) in 22 occurrences. No new or unusual illicit drug was detected in the sample. CONCLUSION: The results show the presence of cocaine in {{more than half of the}} sample, an absence of new or unusual illicit drugs, as well as very few traces of methadone, which suggests that this substitution drug is rarely injected.

40|$|Background: Treatment of {{hepatitis}} C (HCV) is very effective, achieving a cure in 50 – 90 % of patients. Besides its own good for individuals, this most likely translates in reduced transmission, but this phenomenon {{has yet to}} be fully explored. Methods and Findings: In this mathematical modeling study done in the context of Vietnam, we estimated the public health benefit that HCV therapy for injecting drug users (IDUs) may achieve. Treatment coverage of 25, 50 and 75 % of chronically HCV-infected IDUs (4 years into infection) is predicted to reduce the chronic HCV viremia prevalence respectively by 21, 37 and 50 %, 11 years after full scale up to the intended coverage. At a constant 50 % coverage level, earlier treatment, 3, 2, and 1 year into infection is predicted to reduce the chronic HCV viremia prevalence by 46, 60 and 85 %. In these later 3 scenarios, for every 100 treatment courses provided, a total of respectively 50, 61 and 94 new infections could be averted. These benefits were projected in the context of current low coverage of methadone maintenance therapy and needles/ <b>syringes</b> <b>exchange</b> programs, and these services expansion showed complementary preventive benefits to HCV therapy. The program treatment commitment associated with the various scenarios is deemed reasonable. Our model projections are robust under adjustment for uncertainty in the model parameter values.

40|$|Abstract Background Of {{the nearly}} 100, 000 street-based IDUs in Pakistan, 20 % have HIV. We {{investigated}} the recent rise in HIV prevalence from 12 to 52 % among IDUs in Sargodha despite > 70 % coverage with <b>syringe</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Methods We interviewed approximately 150 IDUs and 30 outreach workers in focus group discussions. Results We found six rural and 28 urban injecting locations. Urban locations have about 20 – 30 people {{at any time}} and about 100 daily; rural locations have twice as many (national average: 4 – 15). About half of the IDUs started injecting within the past 2 years and are not proficient at injecting themselves. They use street injectors, who have 15 – 16 clients daily. Heroin is almost exclusively the drug used. Most inject 5 – 7 times daily. Nearly all injectors claim to use fresh syringes. However, they load, inject and share using a locally developed method called scale. Most Pakistani IDUs prefer to double pump drug the syringe, which allows mixing of blood with drug in the syringe. The injector injects 3 ml and keeps 2 ml (the scale) as injection fee. The injector usually pools all the leftover scale (now with some blood mixed with drug) either for his own use or to sell it. Most IDUs backload the scale they buy into their own fresh syringes. Discussion Use of an unprecedented method of injecting drugs that largely bypasses fresh syringes, larger size of sharing networks, higher injection frequency and near universal use of street injectors likely explain for the rapid rise in HIV prevalence among IDUs in Sargodha despite high level provision of fresh syringes. This had been missed by us and the national surveillance, which is quantitative. We have addressed this by hiring injectors as peer outreach workers and increasing syringe supply. Our findings highlight both the importance of qualitative research and operations research to enrich the quality of HIV prevention programs. </p...|$|R
40|$|Although {{data on the}} {{prevalence}} of injection drug use are an essential prerequisite for estimating {{the number of individuals}} infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there have been few attempts to utilize statistical methods of population estimation based on multiple data sources. Data on 3, 670 cases (2, 866 individuals) were obtained from the HIV test register, drug treatment agencies, police records, and needle and <b>syringe</b> <b>exchanges</b> in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1990. Log-linear analysis was used to model the number of individuals in each of the sources. The model incorporating dependency among the three health care agencies (HIV test, drug treatment, and needle exchange) and independence of the police sample fitted the data well, with a residual chi 2 value of 2. 9 (6 df). The expected value of the missing cell corresponding to absence from all four samples was 5, 628, yielding an overall estimate of 8, 494 injectors (95 % confidence interval (CI) 7, 491 - 9, 721), for a prevalence rate of 1. 35 % for people aged 15 - 55 years in Glasgow during 1990. The high ratio of known to unknown injectors (1 : 2) resulted from the extensive coverage of known injectors and the relatively high level of overlap between the combined health care agency sample and the police sample. While further analysis demonstrated that the probability of appearing in the four samples varied by age and sex, heterogeneity in the population did not affect the choice of model or substantially alter the estimates for the total number of unknown injectors. A concurrent study of a community-wide sample of 503 injectors resulted in an HIV prevalence rate of 1. 1 % (95 % CI 0. 4 - 2. 5 %).

40|$|Most {{patients}} in critical care receive intravenous infusion therapy, which is challenging for several reasons. Firstly, critically ill patients often require {{the support of}} drugs that must be administered continuously, accurately and precisely. Syringe pumps are typically used for this purpose. Secondly, the challenging nature of vascular access, its associated risk of catheter-related infections and sepsis, and drug incompatibility, require that multiple drugs are co-administered through one multiple-in single-out infusion set and one catheter lumen. This technique of co-administering drugs is known as multi-infusion and {{has been associated with}} dosing errors caused by physical effects related to the infusion hardware, despite the use of accurate syringe pumps. A final complicating factor is that many patients, especially neonates, cannot tolerate large quantities of fluids. For this reason, the flow rate has to be low, which requires the drug solution to be relatively concentrated {{in order to be able}} to administer the effective dose. From this it follows that small fluctuations in flow rate can lead to substantial dosing errors. The general objective of this thesis was to investigate physical causes of dosing errors - related to infusion hardware - in patients receiving multi-infusion therapy, and the clinical consequences of these dosing errors. In clinical practice, the dosing errors are typically followed after interventions such as flow rate changes, starting of the infusion pump from standstill, <b>syringe</b> <b>exchanges</b> and vertical displacement of the pump relative to the patient. The errors may occur in the pump in which the interventions were conducted as well as the other parallel pumps that co-administer medication on a common infusion set and catheter to the patient. The most important physical effects that cause dosing errors in patients receiving multi-infusion therapy are mechanical compliance, flow resistance and dead volume. The dosing errors caused by the interplay of all these effects can be counter-intuitive and ambiguous. Nevertheless, in this thesis it was shown that the dosing errors can be predicted, both by modeling and in vitro measurements. Dosing errors due to physical causes related to infusion hardware and interventions have the potential to have measurable, clinically relevant impact in patients. Technical innovations, standards, regulations and creating awareness through education programs may mitigate the dosing errors and the clinical consequences thereof. The results of this research may therefore contribute to patient safety...|$|R

None {{operate within}} the United States. There {{is a growing}} body of research that supports the public health effectiveness and cost savings of SIFs. Harm reduction advocates in large US cities are exploring the possibility of operating SIFs in the US. This study is intended to characterize injection drug users who expressed a desire to use a SIF if it were made available in the Seattle area. Methods: Anonymous street intercept survey data were gathered at area <b>syringe</b> <b>exchanges</b> operated by Public Health-Seattle & King County in 2013. Descriptive statistics, bi-variate analyses, and logistic regression models were used to examine these data to understand characteristics associated with interest in a SIF. Results: A large majority, 87 %, of those surveyed indicated interest in using a SIF if one were available (among the 420 who responded to the question with an explicit yes or no). Individuals who reported injecting into femoral veins (OR 5. 36 95 %CI 1. 23 - 23. 32) or into a muscle (OR 2. 52 95 %CI 1. 17 - 5. 45) were more likely to report they would use a SIF. Those who have witnessed an overdose (OR 2. 56 95 %CI 1. 24 - 5. 27) and those without permanent housing (OR 1. 57 95 %CI 0. 81 - 3. 03) were also more likely to report they would use a SIF. The results of this study indicate that injection drug user interest in a SIF is high. Conclusion: A significant portion of injection drug users in King County have expressed interest in using a SIF. Individuals with high risk behaviors related to injecting drugs indicated greater interest in using a SIF than IDUs that engage in safer injection practices. Interventions with these high risk individuals have more potential of improving public health than interventions targeting lower risk IDUs. Drug users, medical and social service providers and public health professionals should consider meeting to plan a pilot SIF locally. Other communities may want to explore the level of interest for a SIF among injection drug users...|$|R

40|$|Treatment of injecting {{drug users}} (IDU) for {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) infection may prevent onward transmission. Treating individuals who often share injecting equipment {{is most likely}} to prevent new infections. However, these high-risk IDU {{are also more likely to}} become re-infected than low-risk IDU. We investigated to which group treatment is best targeted. We modelled the expected benefits per treatment of one chronically HCV-infected IDU in a population of low- and high-risk IDU. The benefits of treating one low- or one high-risk IDU were compared. Benefits included the probability for the treated IDU to become and remain uninfected, as well as the expected number of prevented infections to others (i. e. we quantified the total expected decrease in chronic infections). We found a threshold in HCV-RNA prevalence above which treating low-risk IDU, and below which treating high-risk IDU, resulted in the greatest benefits. This threshold was at 50 % of <b>exchanged</b> <b>syringes</b> being HCV contaminated. When 42 % of IDU engaged in high-risk behaviour (borrowing and lending out syringes 7. 3 times more frequently than low-risk IDU), the corresponding threshold of HCV-RNA prevalence among IDU was at 32 %. Larger-risk heterogeneity led to a lower corresponding threshold among IDU. A combination of HCV treatment and 50 % risk reduction was best directed at high-risk IDU for prevalence among syringes up to 59 %. The threshold was marginally sensitive to changes in disease and treatment variables.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Treatment of injecting {{drug users}} (IDU) for {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) infection may prevent onward transmission. Treating individuals who often share injecting equipment {{is most likely}} to prevent new infections. However, these high-risk IDU {{are also more likely to}} become re-infected than low-risk IDU. We investigated to which group treatment is best targeted. DESIGN: We modelled the expected benefits per treatment of one chronically HCV-infected IDU in a population of low- and high-risk IDU. The benefits of treating one low- or one high-risk IDU were compared. MEASUREMENTS: Benefits included the probability for the treated IDU to become and remain uninfected, as well as the expected number of prevented infections to others (i. e. we quantified the total expected decrease in chronic infections). FINDINGS: We found a threshold in HCV-RNA prevalence above which treating low-risk IDU, and below which treating high-risk IDU, resulted in the greatest benefits. This threshold was at 50 % of <b>exchanged</b> <b>syringes</b> being HCV contaminated. When 42 % of IDU engaged in high-risk behaviour (borrowing and lending out syringes 7. 3 times more frequently than low-risk IDU), the corresponding threshold of HCV-RNA prevalence among IDU was at 32 %. Larger-risk heterogeneity led to a lower corresponding threshold among IDU. A combination of HCV treatment and 50 % risk reduction was best directed at high-risk IDU for prevalence among syringes up to 59 %. The threshold was marginally sensitive to changes in disease and treatment variables. CONCLUSIONS: When more than half of all <b>exchanged</b> <b>syringes</b> in a population of injecting drug users (IDU) are contaminated by hepatitis C virus, it is most efficient to treat low-risk IDU first. Below this threshold, it is most efficient to treat high-risk IDU first...|$|R
