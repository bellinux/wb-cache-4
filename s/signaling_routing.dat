40|$|Asynchronous {{transfer}} mode (ATM) networks must de#ne multicast capabilities {{in order to}} efficiently support numerous applications, such as LAN emulation, Internet protocol (IP) multicasting, video conferencing and distributed applications.

40|$|In {{the future}} network, optical {{technology}} {{will play a}} stronger role not only for transmission but also for switching. Optical burst switching (OBS) emerged as a promising switching paradigm. It brings together the complementary strengths of optics and electronics. This paper presents the design and implementation of an overlay mode burst-switched photonic network testbed, including its architecture, protocols, algorithms and experiments. We propose a flexible “transceiver + forwarding ” OBS node architecture to perform both electronic burst assembly/disassembly and optical burst forwarding. It {{has been designed to}} provide class of service (CoS), wavelength selection for local bursts, and transparency to cut-through bursts. The functional modules of OBS control plane and its key design issues are presented, including <b>signaling,</b> <b>routing,</b> and a novel scheduling mechanism with combined contention resolution in space and wavelength domains. Finally, we report the experimental results on functional verification, performance analysis and service demonstration.

40|$|Executive summary Service {{providers}} {{continue to}} look to developments in Optical <b>Signaling,</b> <b>Routing</b> and Management (OSRM) technologies to provide increased network automation {{that will allow them}} to offer new, diversified services while concurrently reducing operational costs. OSRM enables the dynamic creation, maintenance and and tear down of connections within and between optical networks. Ongoing OSRM test events at the University of New Hampshire’s InterOperability Laboratory (UNH-IOL) are bringing together service providers and telecom equipment vendors in this emerging market to demonstrate and facilitate standards based interoperability. As part of this effort, the UNH-IOL recently conducted a Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) test event. GMPLS is one of several OSRM technologies that Service providers can utilize to automate the delivery and management of bandwidth how and deliver to their customers. The results of the independent GMPLS testing conducted at UNH-IOL are detailed in this white paper, and suggest that significant progress continues to be made in the areas of OSRM standards development and vendor implementation; this progress, in turn, will enable service providers to sell optical services to customers with greater efficiency, differentiation, and profitability...|$|E

A modulation-doped p-AlGaAs–GaAs heterostructure is employed to control spontaneous emission packet positioning with electric fields. Emission packets generated by optical input signals are brought over 150 m with electric fields, so the output fibers can detect the emission intensity as signals.

50|$|An RF matrix {{is used in}} test systems, in both design {{verification}} and manufacturing test, to route high frequency signals between the device under test (DUT) and the test and measurement equipment. In addition to <b>signal</b> <b>routing,</b> the RF/Microwave Switch Matrix may also contain signal conditioning components including passive signal conditioning devices, such as attenuators, filters, and directional couplers, as well as active signal conditioning, such as amplification and frequency converters. Since the <b>signal</b> <b>routing</b> and <b>signal</b> conditioning needs of a test system differ from design to design, RF/Microwave Switch Matrices typically are custom designed by the test system engineer or by a hired contractor for each new test system.|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{mammalian}} brain exhibits profuse interregional connectivity. How {{information flow}} is rapidly and flexibly switched among connected areas remains poorly understood. Task-dependent {{changes in the}} power and interregion coherence of network oscillations suggest that such oscillations {{play a role in}} <b>signal</b> <b>routing.</b> We show that switching one of several convergent pathways from an asynchronous to an oscillatory state allows accurate selective transmission of population-coded information, which can be extracted even when other convergent pathways fire asynchronously at comparable rates. We further show that the band-pass filtering required to perform this information extraction can be implemented in a simple spiking network model with a single feed-forward interneuron layer. This constitutes a mechanism for flexible <b>signal</b> <b>routing</b> in neural circuits, which exploits sparsely synchronized network oscillations and temporal filtering by feed-forward inhibition.
