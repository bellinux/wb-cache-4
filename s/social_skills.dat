5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} alcohol {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. <b>Social</b> <b>skills</b> are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen {{as a direct result of}} long-term alcohol misuse.|$|E

Strong <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> can facilitate interpersonal interactions, which can in turn lead to effective job outcomes. Although the change in organizational structures and the importance of <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> have heightened awareness of <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> in organizational outcomes, little is known about what <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> is and its role in influencing work outcomes. In this study, I provide some insight into the definition and measurement of <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> and how <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> influences job and career success outcomes. Based on my review of the <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> literature, I defined <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> as a learnable social behavior used to achieve social goals. Further, I proposed an integrated <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> framework that theorized <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> as a higher-order construct with three sub-factors: social presentation, social scanning, and social flexibility. I conducted three studies to develop a measure of <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> and examine the antecedents and outcomes of <b>social</b> <b>skill.</b> The results, based on over 400 employees, show that personality factors, such as self-monitoring and extraversion, {{have a positive effect on}} <b>social</b> <b>skill.</b> The findings also suggest that <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> successfully predicts the number of mentors, mentoring received, social support, organizational citizenship behavior, and job performance. Finally, the findings indicate that <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> should be operationalized as a higher-order construct. The study provides both theoretical and practical implications for researchers and organizations interested in the development of <b>social</b> <b>skill...</b>|$|R
40|$|Summary-The {{relations}} between premorbid adjustment, <b>social</b> <b>skill,</b> and domains of functioning (symptoms, social adjustment) {{were examined in}} a group of 107 schizophrenic, schizoaffective, and affective disorder patients. Premorbid sexual adjustment was moderately correlated with <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> in the schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients. Schizophrenic patients had the lowest premorbid adjustment and <b>social</b> <b>skill,</b> followed by schizoaffectives, and then affective patients. Within the schizophrenic group, <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> was significantly related to both current social adjustment and negative symptoms, but not positive symptoms.

5|$|Smaller {{numbers of}} {{children}} show less positive development at age 12 months. Their less desirable attachment styles may be predictors of poor later social development. Although these children's behavior at 12 months is not a serious problem, {{they appear to be}} on developmental trajectories that will end in poor <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> and relationships. Because attachment styles may serve as predictors of later development, it may be appropriate to think of certain attachment styles as part of the range of attachment disorders.|$|E

5|$|Ideally, these <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> become {{incorporated}} into the internal working model {{to be used with}} other children and later with adult peers. As children move into the school years at about six years old, most develop a goal-corrected partnership with parents, in which each partner is willing to compromise in order to maintain a gratifying relationship. By middle childhood, the goal of the attachment behavioural system has changed from proximity to the attachment figure to availability. Generally, a child is content with longer separations, provided contact—or the possibility of physically reuniting, if needed—is available. Attachment behaviours such as clinging and following decline and self-reliance increases. By middle childhood (ages 7–11), there may be a shift toward mutual coregulation of secure-base contact in which caregiver and child negotiate methods of maintaining communication and supervision as the child moves toward a greater degree of independence.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the many}} studies on behavior-based early {{intervention}} programs, most are case reports {{of up to}} five participants and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as self-injury, aggression, noncompliance, stereotypies, or spontaneous language; unintended side effects are largely ignored. Despite the popularity of <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> training, its effectiveness is not firmly established. A randomized controlled study of a model for training parents in problem behaviors in their children with AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported less intense behavioral problems in their AS children. Vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace behavior to older children and adults with AS, and organization software and personal data assistants can improve the work and life management of people with AS.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{body of research}} demonstrating a significant association between attachment organizations and children's functioning across multiple domains. Early insecure attachment does not necessarily predict difficulties, {{but it is a}} liability for the child, particularly if similar parental behaviours continue throughout childhood. Compared to that of securely attached children, the adjustment of insecure children in many spheres of life is not as soundly based, putting their future relationships in jeopardy. Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are more likely to become socially competent than their insecure peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition of <b>social</b> <b>skills,</b> intellectual development and the formation of social identity. Classification of children's peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment. Insecure children, particularly avoidant children, are especially vulnerable to family risk. Their social and behavioural problems increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting protective function. As with attachment to parental figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{determining}} {{the relationship between}} media literacy and <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> levels of the eighth grade primary school students, considering various variables, is aimed. With this design, the questions of whether the relationship between media literacy and <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> levels of the eighth grade primary school students differs significantly according to gender, having access to internet; as well as {{whether there is a}} relationship between media literacy and <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> levels are tried to be answered. This study is based on correlative survey model among general survey models. The study group consists of 947 eighth grade primary school students who study at the schools selected randomly from five different educational areas in the city center of Elazığ. Economical conditions and family profiles were considered in selection of those schools. In the study, two different assessment scales have been used to receive students’ opinions. One of them is the “Level Determination Scale for Media Literacy” which was developed by Karaman ve Karataş (2009) and the other one is the “Social Skill Inventory”, as translated into Turkish by Galip Yüksel in 2004, which was developed by Riggio in 1989. The study has showed {{that there is not a}} significant relationship between media literacy level and <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> level. Considering the relationship according to the sub-factors, it is observed that there is a relationship between some sub-factors; however this relationship is very weak. It is observed that gender of the students does not form a significant difference for media literacy but it does for <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> level. Furthermore, female students’ <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> levels are found to be higher.

Also, situation-specific criteria for evaluating levels of <b>social</b> <b>skill</b> were established. The second phase involved validation of the role-play test by determining {{the extent to which}} it discriminated visually-handicapped from nonhandicapped participants.

5|$|Typical {{attachment}} development {{begins with}} unlearned infant reactions to social signals from caregivers. The ability to {{send and receive}} social communications through facial expressions, gestures and voice develops with social experience by seven to nine months. This {{makes it possible for}} an infant to interpret messages of calm or alarm from face or voice. At about eight months, infants typically begin to respond with fear to unfamiliar or startling situations, and to look to the faces of familiar caregivers for information that either justifies or soothes their fear. This developmental combination of <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> and the emergence of fear reactions results in attachment behavior such as proximity-seeking, if a familiar, sensitive, responsive, and cooperative adult is available. Further developments in attachment, such as negotiation of separation in the toddler and preschool period, depend on factors such as the caregiver's interaction style and ability to understand the child's emotional communications.|$|E
5|$|Mu {{waves are}} thought to be {{indicative}} of an infant’s developing ability to imitate. This is important because the ability to imitate plays a vital {{role in the development of}} motor skills, tool use, and understanding causal information through social interaction. Mimicking is integral in the development of <b>social</b> <b>skills</b> and understanding nonverbal cues. Causal relationships can be made through social learning without requiring experience firsthand. In action execution, mu waves are present in both infants and adults before and after the execution of a motor task and its accompanying desynchronization. While executing a goal-oriented action, however, infants exhibit a higher degree of desynchronization than do adults. Just as with an action execution, during action observation infants’ mu waves not only show a desynchronization, but show a desynchronization greater in degree than the one evidenced in adults. This tendency for changes in degree of desynchronization, rather than actual changes in frequency, becomes the measure for mu wave development throughout adulthood, although the most changes take place during the first year of life. Understanding the mechanisms that are shared between action perception and execution in the earliest years of life has implications for language development. Learning and understanding through social interaction comes from imitating movements as well as vowel sounds. Sharing the experience of attending to an object or event with another person can be a powerful force in the development of language.|$|E
