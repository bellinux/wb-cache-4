Over the {{following}} decades he has produced well over three hundred public events with writers and occasionally musicians, fundraisers for KPFA and the parent Pacifica network, often {{in conjunction with}} other non-profit organizations. For over twenty years he has co-produced the KPFA events with Ken Preston.The events are routinely recorded for subsequent radio broadcast and webcast, with dissemination in CD and DVD format. For most events he produced original posters, at first often <b>silkscreened,</b> later produced digitally; he also designed posters for UC Berkeley Graduate Journalism Dept; and for UCB International Studies Department. A collection of his posters is in the Oakland Museum of California. His posters are featured on his website, along with other artworks. Some posters are displayed on the KPFA website.|$|E
500|$|Irving Blum was {{the first}} dealer to show Warhol's soup can paintings. Blum {{happened}} to be visiting Warhol in May 1962, {{at a time when}} Warhol was being featured in a May 11, 1962 Time magazine article [...] "The Slice-of-Cake School" [...] (that included a portion of Warhol's <b>silkscreened</b> 200 One Dollar Bills), along with Lichtenstein, Rosenquist, and Wayne Thiebaud. Warhol was the only artist whose photograph actually appeared in the article, which is indicative of his knack for manipulating the mass media. Blum saw dozens of Campbell's Soup can variations, including a grid of One-Hundred Soup Cans that day. Blum was shocked that Warhol had no gallery arrangement and offered him a July show at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. This would be Warhol's first one-man show of his pop art. Warhol was assured by Blum that the newly founded Artforum magazine, which had an office above the gallery, would cover the show. Not only was the show Warhol's first solo gallery exhibit, but it was considered to be the West Coast premiere of pop art. [...] Andy Warhol's first New York solo Pop exhibit was hosted at Eleanor Ward's Stable Gallery November 6–24, 1962. The exhibit included the works Marilyn Diptych, Green Coca-Cola Bottles, and Campbell's Soup Cans.|$|E
500|$|Warhol sent Blum thirty-two [...] canvases of Campbell's Soup can portraits, each {{representing}} a particular {{variety of the}} Campbell's Soup flavors available at the time. The thirty-two canvases are very similar: each is a realistic depiction of the iconic, mostly red and white Campbell's Soup can <b>silkscreened</b> onto a white background. The canvases have minor variation in the lettering of the variety names. Most of the letterings are painted in red letters. Four varieties have black lettering: Clam Chowder has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that said (Manhattan Style), {{which means that the}} soup is tomato- and broth-based instead of the cream-based New England style; Beef has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that says (With Vegetables and Barley); Scotch Broth has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that said (A Hearty Soup); and Minestrone had black parenthetical lettering saying (Italian-Style Vegetable Soup). There are two varieties with red lettered parenthetical labels: Beef Broth (Bouillon) and Consommé (Beef). The font sizes only vary slightly in the variety names. However, there are a few notable stylistic font differences. Old-fashioned Tomato Rice is the only variety with lower case script. This lower case script appears to be from a slightly different font than the other variety name letters. There are other stylistic differences. Old-fashioned Tomato Rice has the word Soup depicted lower on the can, in place of a portion of ornamental starlike symbols at the bottom that the other 31 varieties have. Also, Cheddar Cheese has two banner-like addenda. In the middle-left, a small golden banner says New!, and a middle center golden banner says Great As A Sauce Too!.|$|E

She found the use of <b>silkscreening</b> to be liberating, and cites influence from Rauschenberg, Warhol, Polke and Richter.|$|R

2500|$|Fashion: Warhol {{is quoted}} for having said: [...] "I'd rather buy a dress {{and put it}} up on the wall, than put a painting, wouldn't you?" [...] One of his most {{well-known}} Superstars, Edie Sedgwick, aspired to be a fashion designer, and his good friend Halston was a famous one. Warhol's work in fashion includes <b>silkscreened</b> dresses, a short sub-career as a catwalk-model and books on fashion as well as paintings with fashion (shoes) as a subject.

Warhol's sculpture {{was part of a}} series of [...] "grocery carton" [...] works that also included Heinz ketchup and Campbell's tomato juice cases. Other famous works include the Silver Clouds—helium filled, silver mylar, pillow-shaped balloons. A Silver Cloud was included in the traveling exhibition Air Art (1968–1969) curated by Willoughby Sharp. Clouds was also adapted by Warhol for avant-garde choreographer Merce Cunningham's dance piece RainForest (1968).|$|E
