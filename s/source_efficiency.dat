40|$|Graduation date: 2003 The Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual (MARSSIM) {{requires}} that Final Status Surveys be performed on materials and surfaces that vary in surface smoothness and/or uniformity. To obtain accurate survey data, {{it may be}} necessary to adjust detector response for these surface variations. NUREG- 1507 refers to such surface efficiency adjustment factors as ε[subscript s], the <b>source</b> <b>efficiency.</b> This parameter is meant to be a detector-independent, yet surface and nuclide-dependent parameter that can be used to adjust observed count rate to provide a true measure of the degree of contamination present. Key measurements in the calculation of (ε[subscript s]) are the energy of the radionuclide contaminant and the average height of the detector above the contaminated surface. During the last year, Oregon State University, Department of Nuclear Engineering and Radiation Health Physics provided technical support for a Final Status Survey of a commercial nuclear plant. OSU NE/RHP has conducted research and experimentation to determine site-specific <b>source</b> <b>efficiency</b> (ε[subscript s]) values for concrete surfaces which had undergone simulated decommissioning activities, such as surface scabbling. <b>Source</b> <b>efficiency</b> (ε[subscript s]) values were determined for seven separate scabbled concrete surfaces which had been prepared using 5 tool types.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Decommissioning Technical Basis Document (DTBD) is to {{establish}} the beta emitting nuclides detectable by site instrumentation as well as adjustments to detection efficiency for <b>Source</b> <b>Efficiency</b> (Es) {{and the presence of}} coatings on surfaces being surveyed. 2. 0 DISCUSSION Detection of beta particles depends on the energy of the beta particles emitted from materials being surveyed and the thickness of the detector window. The efficiency of the detector for beta particles is determined by exposing the detector to a known activity level of beta particles of a given energy and recording the resulting count rate (Ei). In order for the efficiency calibration to be accurate, the energy of the calibration source must be similar to the energy of the source to be measured in the field. Assuming that the calibration source is of appropriate energy, other adjustments may need to be made to the efficiency in order to accurately determine true source activity.

40|$|The proton <b>source</b> <b>efficiency</b> (ψ*) was {{studied for}} {{homogeneous}} and heterogeneous distributions of minor actinides in a nitride-fuelled and lead-bismuth-cooled accelerator-driven system. The {{findings from the}} MCNPX simulations indicate that, compared to a homogeneous configuration, a gain in ψ * by up to 16 % {{can be obtained by}} distributing the minor actinides heterogeneously, Cm being placed in the inner zone of the active core and Am in the outer zone. The reason for this is the higher fission probability for neutrons for Cm than for Am in the energy range below 1. 0 MeV. Moreover, a comparative study of two different physics packages available in MCNPX, the Bertini and the CEM models, has been performed, focusing on the production of neutrons in the spallation target and on the proton <b>source</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The Bertini model was found to produce a higher number of neutrons in the low-energy range (below ∼ 15 MeV) than the CEM model. Consequently, the Bertini model also over-estimates ψ * by about 10 %, compared to the CEM model...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – In {{order to}} study the beam power {{amplification}} of an accelerator driven system (ADS), a new parameter, the proton <b>source</b> <b>efficiency</b> (ψ*) is introduced. ψ * represents the average importance of the external proton source, relative to the average importance of the eigenmode production, and {{is closely related to}} the neutron <b>source</b> <b>efficiency</b> (ϕ*), which is frequently used in the ADS field. ϕ * is commonly used in the physics of sub-critical systems driven by any external source (spallation source, (d,d), (d,t), Cf- 252 spontaneous fissions etc.). On the contrary, ψ * has been defined in this paper exclusively for ADS studies, where the system is driven by a spallation source. The main advantage with using ψ * instead of ϕ * for ADS is that the way of defining the external source is unique and that it is proportional to the core power divided by the proton beam power, independently of the neutron source distribution. Numerical simulations have been performed with the Monte Carlo code MCNPX in order to study ψ* as a function of different design parameters. It was found that, in order to maximize ψ*, and therefore minimizing the proton current needs, a target radius as small as possible should be chosen. For target radii smaller than about 30 cm, lead-bismuth is a better choice of coolant material than sodium, regarding the proton <b>source</b> <b>efficiency,</b> while for larger target radii the two materials are equally good. The optimal axial proton beam impact was found to be located approximately 20 cm above the core center. Varying the proton energy, ψ*/Ep was found to have a maximum for proton energies between 1200 and 1400 MeV. Increasing the americium content in the fuel decreases ψ * considerably, in particular when the target radius is large...|$|E
40|$|The accelerator-driven {{subcritical}} system (ADS) {{is driven}} by a neutron source from spallation reactions introduced by the injected proton beam. Part of the neutron source has energy {{as high as a}} few hundred MeV to a few GeV. The effects of high-energy source neutrons (En >  20  MeV) are usually approximated by energy cut-off treatment in practical core calculations, which can overestimate the predicted proton beam current in the ADS design. This article intends to quantize this effect and propose a way to solve this problem. To evaluate the effects of high-energy neutrons in the subcritical core, two models are established aiming to cover the features of current experimental facilities and industrial-scale ADS in the future. The results show that high-energy neutrons with En >  20  MeV are of small fraction (2. 6 %) in the neutron source, but their contribution to the <b>source</b> <b>efficiency</b> is about 23 % for the large scale ADS. Based on this, a neutron <b>source</b> <b>efficiency</b> correction factor is proposed. Tests show that the new correction method works well in the ADS calculation. This method can effectively improve the accuracy of the prediction of the proton beam current...|$|E

Monte Carlo transport and burnup codes were used in the analyses. The lattice pin pitch was varied to optimize the <b>source</b> <b>efficiency</b> and coolant void worth while respecting key thermal and material-related design constraints posed by fuel and cladding. A HfN matrix appeared to provide a good combination of neutronic, burnup, and safety characteristics: maintaining a hard neutron spectrum, yielding acceptable coolant void reactivity and <b>source</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and alleviating the burnup reactivity swing. A conceptual design of a (TRU,Hf) N fueled, lead-bismuth eutectic-cooled accelerator-driven system was developed. Twice higher neutron fission-toabsorption probabilities in Am isotopes were achieved compared to reactor designs relying on ZrN or YN inert matrix fuel. The production of higher actinides in the fuel cycle is hence limited, with a Cm fraction in the equilibrium fuel being; 40 % lower than for cores with ZrN matrix-based fuel. The burnup reactivity swing and associated power peaking in the core are managed by an appropriate choice of cycle length (100 days) and by core enrichment zoning.

The survey activities included visual inspections and measurement and sampling activities. Confirmatory activities also included the review and assessment of UM�s project documentation and methodologies. Surface scans identified elevated activity in two areas. The first area was on a wall outside of Room 3103 and the second area was in the southwest section on the first floor. The first area was remediated to background levels. However, the second area was due to gamma shine from a neighboring source storage area. A retrospective analysis of UM�s FSS data shows that for the SUs investigated by the ORAU survey team, UM met the survey requirements set forth in the FSSP. The total mean surface activity values were directly compared with the mean total surface activity reported by UM. Mean surface activity values determined by UM were within two standard deviations of the mean determined by ORAU. Additionally, all surface activity values were less than the corresponding gross beta DCGL{sub W}. Laboratory analysis of the soil showed that COC concentrations were less than the respective DCGL{sub W} values. For the inter-lab comparison, the DER was above 3 for only one sample.
