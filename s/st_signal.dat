40|$|Excitation-contraction {{coupling}} at {{the onset}} of beating in the 9 - 10 -somite embryonic chick heart was studied by means of an optical method together with a voltage-sensitive merocyanine-rhodanine dye. Spontaneous optical signals were recorded simultaneously from many areas of the embryonic heart, using a square photodiode matrix array. At time of initiation of the heartbeat, spontaneous optical signals consisting of two components were often detected. The first component (1 <b>st</b> <b>signal)</b> is a dye-related absorption change due to the action potential, and the second component (2 nd signal) is a light scattering change due to contraction. When Ca 2 + in the bathing solution was partly replaced by Mg 2 +, the peak size of both signals was reduced. The correlation between the 1 st and 2 nd signals corresponded to the relationship between excitation and contraction. The formation of excitation-contraction coupling exhibited a regional non-uniformity in the developing 9 - 10 -somite embryonic hearts: contraction was first generated in the right ventricular region, and then the contractile area spread widely over the whole of the heart. The curves of the excitation-related 1 <b>st</b> <b>signal</b> vs. the contraction-related 2 nd signal obtained from different areas were not superimposable. Decoupling of excitation from contraction was produced by raising the Ca 2 + concentration in the bathing solution, by lowering the Na 2 + concentration or by inclusion of a Ca 2 + ionophore (A 23187). Replacement of the bathing solution with D 2 O or hypertonic solution also suppressed excitation-contraction coupling. The results suggest that in the early embryonic initial beating chick heart, the contractile system is activated by Ca 2 + influx across the sarcolemma accompanying the action potential, and that a Na+-Ca 2 + exchange mechanism participates in the relaxation phase of the heartbeat...|$|E

40|$|With an {{increasing}} focus on automatic diagnoses of cardiac disease through ECG signals, de-noising tech-niques {{that do not}} introduce artifacts have become neces-sary.

The ECG signal is mod-eled as the sum of the activity at the SA node, AV node, Bundle branches, Purkenji fibers, and right and left ven-tricles. The model is adapted to the targeted ECG signal using a nonlinear least squares optimization technique.

RT-PCR analysis of total RNA recovered from the nerve homogenates showed increase in the C 6 <b>ST</b> <b>signal</b> in comparison to that of the housekeeping glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate and the change peaked at 14 days post-crush. This was in phase with the changes we observed in 6 -sulfated CS glycoforms.

The anti-sense probe located C 6 ST transcripts in myelinated fibres but the sense probe showed negative results. In the normal intact nerve, the granular positivity appeared organized in the rim of myelinated fibres whereas in the crushed nerve, the granular positivity appeared profusely distributed in fibres undergoing myelinic reorganization.

40|$|The article {{reports a}} {{feasibility}} study about the potentiality of an in vivo dosimetry method for the adaptive radiotherapy of the lung tumors treated by 3 D conformal radiotherapy techniques 3 D CRTs. At the moment image guided radiotherapy IGRT {{has been used}} for this aim, but it requires taking many periodic radiological images during the treatment that increase workload and patient dose. In vivo dosimetry reported here can reduce the above efforts, alerting the medical staff for the commissioning of new radiological images for an eventual adaptive plan. The in vivo dosimetry method applied on 20 patients makes use of the transit signal St on the beam central axis measured by a small ion chamber positioned on an electronic portal imaging device EPID or by the EPID itself. The reconstructed in vivo dosimetry at the isocenter point Diso requires a convolution between the transit signal St and a dose reconstruction factor C that essentially depends on i tissue inhomogeneities along the beam central axis and ii the in-patient isocenter depth. The C factors, one for every gantry angle, are obtained by processing the patient’s computed tomography scan. The method has been recently applied in some Italian centers to check the radiotherapy of pelvis, breast, head, and thorax treatments. In this work the dose reconstruction was carried out in five centers to check the Diso in the lung tumor during the 3 D CRT, and the results have been used to detect the interfraction tumor anatomy variations that can require new CT imaging and an adaptive plan. In particular, in three centers a small ion chamber was positioned below the patient and used for the St measurement. In two centers, the <b>St</b> <b>signal</b> was obtained directly by 25 central pixels of an a-Si EPID, equipped with commercial software that enabled its use as a stable detector.

40|$|Modern cities {{experience}} {{heavy traffic}} flows and congestions regularly across space and time. Monitoring traffic situations becomes an important {{challenge for the}} Traffic Control and Surveillance Systems (TCSS). In advanced TCSS, {{it is helpful to}} automatically detect and classify different traffic incidents such as severity of congestion, abnormal driving pattern, abrupt or illegal stop on road, etc. Although most TCSS are equipped with basic incident detection algorithms, they are however crude to be really useful as an automated tool for further classification. In literature, {{there is a lack of}} research for Automated Incident Classification (AIC). Therefore, a novel AIC method is proposed in this paper to tackle such challenges. In the proposed method, traffic signals are firstly extracted from captured videos and converted as spatial-temporal (<b>ST)</b> <b>signals.</b> Based on the characteristics of the <b>ST</b> <b>signals,</b> a set of realistic simulation data are generated to construct an extended big traffic database to cover a variety of traffic situations. Next, a Mean-Shift filter is introduced to suppress the effect of noise and extract significant features from the <b>ST</b> <b>signals.</b> The extracted features are then associated with various types of traffic data: one normal type (inliers) and multiple abnormal types (outliers). For the classification, an adaptive boosting classifier is trained to detect outliers in traffic data automatically. Further, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based method is adopted to train the model for identifying the categories of outliers. In short, this hybrid approach is called an Adaptive Boosting Support Vector Machines (AB-SVM) method. Experimental results show that the proposed AB-SVM method achieves a satisfied result with more than 92 % classification accuracy on average. Comment: 27 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

A ‘subblockwise’ linear assumption-based channel model is proposed to represent the mobile-to-mobile time- and frequency-selective channels. We then propose a novel ST strategy that allows the destination node to separately obtain the channel information of the source → relay link and the relay → destination link, from which the optimal <b>ST</b> <b>signals</b> are derived by minimizing the channel mean-square-error. To enhance the performance of channel estimation, a subblock tracking-based low-complexity decision feedback approach is introduced to iteratively mitigate the unknown data interference.

In this paper, we present two methods: Kernel Smoothing Naïve Bayes (NB) method and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) method to automatically detect any hardware errors as well as abnormal traffic events in traffic data collected at a four-arm junction in Hong Kong. Traffic data was recorded in a video format, and converted to spatial-temporal (<b>ST)</b> traffic <b>signals</b> by statistics. The <b>ST</b> <b>signals</b> are then projected to a two-dimensional (2 D) (x,y) -coordinate plane by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction.
