As such, apatite-based microcarriers intended for bone tissue engineering applications would be featured here. Hydroxyapatite-Alginate (HA-Alg) suspension was extruded drop-wise into a calcium chloride (CaCl 2) crosslinking solution. The HA-Alg microcarriers were then sintered to form microcarriers of uniform size. The physicochemical properties were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometery (XRD), and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometry. Cell viability on these microcarriers was evaluated using human fetal mesenchymal stem cells (hfMSCs). SEM images revealed that sintered apatite-based microcarriers exhibited a rough surface topology with interconnected pores. XRD results showed that these microcarriers remained phase-pure since no other <b>secondary</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> phases were detected. FTIR analysis indicated several sharp phosphate bands coupled with a hydroxyl band (all belonging to HA). Live/dead staining showed that hfMSCs remained viable after 14 days of culture, and cells have spread and covered the surfaces of the microcarriers. Certainly, these cell-loaded microcarriers could be potentially used in bone implant science...|$|E
40|$|The {{sorption}} {{behavior and}} the mechanism of phosphate sorption on monohydrocalcite (CaCO 3 ·H 2 O; MHC) were analyzed {{on the basis of}} sorption isotherms corresponding to three Mg concentrations. MHC is known to be metastable, and it quickly transforms to calcite or aragonite. However, a small amount of phosphate (30 μM) can significantly inhibit the transformation of MHC. At low phosphate loading, the sorption isotherms obtained are Langmuir adsorption isotherms. The mode of phosphate sorption is most likely to be adsorption on MHC surface at the low phosphate loadings. The Langmuir parameters indicate that the mass basis sorption capacity of MHC is significantly higher than those of aragonite and calcite. At higher phosphate loadings, the slopes of the obtained isotherms rapidly increase and deviate from that of a Langmuir isotherm. The slopes of the isotherms for low Mg concentrations are higher than those for high Mg concentrations. It is well documented that Mg inhibits the formation of calcium phosphate minerals. The saturation calculations performed in this study showed that the reacted solutions become supersaturated with respect to amorphous calcium phosphate at corresponding high phosphate loadings. The mode of phosphate sorption at higher phosphate loadings is considered to correspond to the formation of <b>secondary</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> minerals. 出版者照会後に全文公...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} conditions, solubility {{and stability}} of monohydrocalcite (MHC, CaCO 3 centerdotH 2 O), as well as sorption behaviors of toxic anions on MHC, are reviewed to evaluate MHC as a remediation material for hazardous oxyanions. MHC is a rare mineral in geological settings that occurs in recent sediments in saline lakes. Water temperature {{does not seem to}} be an important factor for MHC formation. The pH of lake water is usually higher than 8 and the Mg/Ca ratio exceeds 4. MHC synthesis experiments as a function of time indicate that MHC is formed from amorphous calcium carbonate and transforms to calcite and/or aragonite. Most studies show that MHC forms from solutions containing Mg, which inhibits the formation of stable calcium carbonates. The solubility of MHC is higher than those of calcite, aragonite and vaterite, but lower than those of ikaite and amorphous calcium carbonate at ambient temperature. The solubility of MHC decreases with temperature. MHC is unstable and readily transforms to calcite or aragonite. The transformation consists of the dissolution of MHC and the subsequent formation of stable phases from the solution. The rate-limiting steps of the transformation of MHC are the nucleation and growth of stable crystalline phases. Natural occurrences indicate that certain additives, particularly PO 4 and Mg, stabilize MHC. Laboratory studies confirm that a small amount of PO 4 in solution (> 30 μM) can significantly inhibit the transformation of MHC. MHC has a higher sorption capacity for PO 4 than calcite and aragonite. The modes of PO 4 uptake are adsorption on the MHC surface at moderate phosphate concentrations and precipitation of <b>secondary</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> minerals at higher concentrations. Arsenate is most likely removed from the solution during the transformation of MHC. The proposed sorption mechanism of arsenate is coprecipitation during crystallization of aragonite. The arsenic sorption capacity by MHC is significantly higher than simple adsorption on calcite...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study the {{accumulation}} and depletion of inorganic soil phosphorus (P) {{in a long term}} (37 yrs) field experiment in Southern Finland. The soil has a loamy texture and a high pH (7. 4) due to heavy liming before the onset of the experiment. The field contains three treatments with different rates of P fertilization 0, 32 and 67 Kg ha- 1 a- 1 (abbreviated as P 0, P 1 and P 2 K) and it has been cultivated with a rotation of barley, oats, spring wheat and rye grass. The grain and straw have been collected every year and analysed for yield and mineral element composition. Soil samples were also collected from the plough layer {{at the beginning of the}} experiment in 1978, and also in the years 1995, 2005 and 2015, including also subsoil samples (25 - 50 cm). The changes in soil inorganic P along the years were studied with the Chang and Jackson fractionation The highest rate of P fertilization (P 2 K) increased the P concentration extracted with NH 4 Cl, NH 4 F, NaOH and H 2 SO 4. These extractions are assumed to dissolve, easily available P, P sorbed by aluminium and iron oxides and calcium phosphates, respectively. On the other hand, the continuous P depletion (P 0 treatment) decreased the NH 4 Cl-P and NH 4 F-P pools, while the NaOH-P and H 2 SO 4 -P pools remained stable. None of the P pools changed significantly at the lower rate of P fertilization (P 1). The results indicate that the iron and aluminium oxides have a similar capacity for P sorption. However, P sorbed by iron oxides appears to remain non-available. Moreover, this study shows that in heavily limed soils the formation of <b>secondary</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> compounds can be an important sink of the applied P. After 37 years, the P 2 K and P 1 K treatment increased the inorganic P reserves of the soil by 732 Kg P ha- 1 and 32 Kg P ha - 1, respectively, while the P 0 treatment depleted - 459 Kg P ha - 1. The recovery rates of P in the plough layer (i. e share of the P balance that is accumulated or depleted in the soil) were 79 %, 30 % and 56 % for the P 0, P 1 and P 2 K treatments, respectively. An estimation of the P movement between adjacent plots was included in the calculation. These low recovery rates indicate that a significant proportion of the applied P is lost either in surface runoff or leached below the plough layer. However, the Chang and Jackson analysis of the subsoil samples did not reveal any significant changes in any of the P fractions. The lack of P accumulation might be attributed to the use of an invalid sampling strategy, to the loss of P to deeper layers through preferential flow and to the possibility that some P has been lost through surface runoff. The highest rate of P fertilization (P 2 K) resulted in a decrease of the P buffer capacity of the soil (BC) and increased the EPC 0 (i. e. P concentration in solution at which no net P sorption or desorption occurs) as derived from the sorption isotherms. The resulting low BC and high EPC 0 (1. 30 mg L- 1) are in agreement with measurements made in other heavily fertilized soils in Finland. The lower fertilization rate (P 1 treatment) did not have an observable effect on the BC or the EPC 0 (0. 33 mg L- 1). The depletion of soil P in the P 0 treatment caused a decrease on the EPC 0 (0. 12 mg L- 1) but only a slight increase on the BC. The degree of P saturation (DPS) of the plough layer was calculated as the ratio between the sum of P extracted with NH 4 Cl, NH 4 F and NaOH and the P sorption capacity of the soil (PSC; i. e. sum of extractable iron and aluminium multiplied by a 0. 5 index (α)). Despite the large P applications during 37 years, the DPS reached only 20 % for the topsoil of the P 2 K treatment, which can be attributed to the high PSC of the soil. The 0. 5 α value is an operationally defined parameter, widely used in international publications, which is supposed to represent the proportion of short-range ordered Fe and Al oxides that contribute to the PSC of the soil. Due to the young age of Finnish soils and their usually high organic matter content, a low crystallinity of the oxides is expected, which could result in a higher α value. To prove this hypothesis, a long term incubation was done as a replicate of other published experiments (250 days, soil solution 1 : 50, P concentration 155 mg P L- 1). Since the incubation includes only 4 samples from a single field, they cannot be extrapolated to other Finnish soils. However, the results (α = 0. 3) might be indicative of a low reactivity of the Al and Fe oxides in our soil. Iron and aluminium oxides are responsible for the accumulation in the soil of large amount of the applied P. However, the P recovery rates in field experiments are usually far for complete. To quantitatively assess the losses of P from the plough layer, a more congruent sampling strategy in the soil profile is needed, together with the analysis of P surface runoff and leaching wate...|$|E
