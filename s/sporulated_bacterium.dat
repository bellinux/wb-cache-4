The isolates were identified {{as members of a}} novel species of the genus Paenibacillus, based on 16 S rRNA gene sequences. According to the results of phylogenetic analysis, the most closely related species was Paenibacillus azoreducens. Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic analyses and DNA–DNA hybridization experiments also showed that the isolates belonged to a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus. The novel species is a facultatively anaerobic, motile, Gram-variable, sporulated rod. The spores of this rod-shaped micro-organism occur in slightly swollen sporangia and are honeycomb-shaped. The main fatty acid is anteiso-branched C 15 : 0. Growth was observed with many carbohydrates, including xylan, as the only carbon source and gas production was not observed from glucose. The novel species produces a wide variety of hydrolytic enzymes, such as xylanases, cellulases, amylases, gelatinase, urease and b-galactosidase. On the contrary, it does not produce caseinase, phenylalanine deaminase or lysine decarboxylase. According to the data obtained in this work, the strains belong to a novel species, for which the name Paenibacillus favisporus sp. nov. is proposed (type strain, GMP 01 T =LMG 20987 T =CECT 5760 T) ...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of cropping systems and soil covers on the microbial community in soil cultivated with muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.). The experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The treatments were arranged in a split plot design with cropping systems (no-tillage and conventional tillage systems) assigned to the whole plot treatments, while a group of seven soil covers (sunn hemp; millet; sunn hemp + millet; corn + brachiaria; spontaneous vegetation; bare soil; and spontaneous vegetation + polyethylene film) defined the subplot treatments.

To determine the quantity of microorganisms, the plate count method was used, with a specific culture medium for the groups. The cultivation of sunn hemp associated with no-tillage at transplanting of muskmelon showed a greater quantity of colony forming units (CFUs) of total bacteria compared to the conventional tillage system.

The identification of these microorganisms, using molecular tools, is of particular importance {{for the maintenance of}} the quality of milk. However, these molecular techniques are not only costly but also labor-intensive and time-consuming. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the efficiency of boiling in conjunction with four other methods for the genomic DNA extraction of <b>sporulated</b> <b>bacteria</b> with proteolytic and lipolytic potential isolated from raw milk in the states of Paraná and Maranhão, Brazil. Protocols based on cellular lysis by enzymatic digestion, phenolic extraction, microwave-heating, as well as the use of guanidine isothiocyanate were used. This study proposes a method involving simple boiling for the extraction of genomic DNA from these microorganisms. Variations in the quality and yield of the extracted DNA among these methods were observed. However, both the cell lysis protocol by enzymatic digestion (commercial kit) and the simple boiling method proposed in this study yielded sufficient DNA for successfully carrying out the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of the rpoB and 16 S rRNA genes for all 11 strains of microorganisms tested. Other protocols failed to yield sufficient quantity and quality of DNA from all microorganisms tested, since only a few strains have showed positive results by PCR, thereby hindering the search for new microorganisms.

The process involves boiling for a period (typically 20 minutes) at atmospheric pressure, cooling, incubating for a day, then repeating the process {{a total of three}} to four times. The incubation periods are to allow heat-resistant spores surviving the previous boiling period to germinate to form the heat-sensitive vegetative (growing) stage, which can be killed by the next boiling step. This is effective because many spores are stimulated to grow by the heat shock. The procedure only works for media that can support bacterial growth, and will not sterilize non-nutritive substrates like water. Tyndallization is also ineffective against prions.|$|R

Using high throughput sequencing, we observed distinct differences in bacterial community composition and structure in SD-layers as compared to clean snow layers. <b>Sporulating</b> <b>bacteria</b> were not enriched in the SD-layers; however, phyla with low abundance such as Gemmatimonadetes and Deinococcus-Thermus appeared to be specific bio-indicators for SD. Since many members of these phyla are known to be adapted to arid oligotrophic environments and UV radiation, they are well suited to survive the harsh conditions of long-range airborne transport...|$|R

The Clostridia species are responsible {{for some of the}} deadliest diseases including gas gangrene, tetanus, and botulism. Clostridium septicum is a rare subgroup known to cause atraumatic myonecrosis and is associated with colonic malignancy or immunosuppression. It is a Gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacillus found in the gastrointestinal tract and can lead to direct, spontaneous infections of the bowel and peritoneal cavity. The anaerobic glycolysis of the tumor produces an acidic, hypoxic environment favoring germination of clostridial spores. Tumor-induced mucosal ulceration allows for translocation of <b>sporulated</b> <b>bacteria</b> from the bowel into the bloodstream, leading to fulminant sepsis. C. septicum bacteremia can have a variable presentation and is associated with greater than 60 % mortality rate. The majority of deaths occur within the first 24 hours if diagnosis and appropriate treatment measures are not promptly started. We report a case of abdominal myonecrosis in a patient with newly diagnosed colon cancer. The aim {{of this study is to}} stress the importance of maintaining a high suspicion of C. septicum infection in patients with underlying colonic malignancy. 1...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{bacterial}} spores in food, feed and pharmaceutical applications {{has been widely}} studied. Bacterial spores {{have been used as}} probiotics for both animals and humans and represent a total annual market of about 565 M€. Some studies have shown that spores can be able to germinate and also to proliferate in the gastrointestinal tract and thus exhibit probiotic activity by bringing a small but consistent improvement in weight gain of about 3 - 4 %. Bacterial spores have been also used as pharmaceutical agents to transport drugs to the intestine. The extreme resistance of the bacterial spores allows them to survive the stomach conditions and carry the drug to the intestine. This article analyzes the major markets for <b>sporulating</b> <b>bacteria,</b> compares the prices for the authorized bacterial spores based probiotics and also states the profits that such probiotics can bring to the animal growth. Furthermore, some other possible applications for bacterial spores are suggested in this article. Although it is not the intent of this paper to deal with the fundamental aspects of sporulation, germination or any other mechanism related to bacterial endospores, a short description of the latter is provided in order to integrate these topics and to better situate the characteristics of these microbial structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{virulence}} of Bacillus cereus {{requires that}} bacteria {{have the capacity}} to colonize their host, degrade specific tissues, and circumvent the host immune system. To study this aspect of pathogenesis, we focused on three metalloproteases, InhA 1, InhA 2, and InhA 3, which share more than 66 % identity. The expression of these metalloprotease genes was assessed by transcriptional fusions with a lacZ reporter gene. The expression profiles suggest a complementary time course of InhA production. Indeed, the genes are simultaneously expressed but are oppositely controlled during stationary phase. We constructed single and multiple inhA mutants and assessed the bacterial locations of the proteins as well as their individual or additive roles in macrophage escape and toxicity, antibacterial-peptide cleavage, and virulence. InhA 1, a major component of the spore exosporium, is the only InhA metalloprotease involved in bacterial escape from macrophages. A mutant lacking inhA 1, inhA 2, and inhA 3 shows a strong decrease in the level of virulence for insects. Taken together, these results show that the InhA metalloproteases of B. cereus are important virulence factors that may allow the bacteria to counteract the host immune system. Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus anthracis are gram-positive <b>sporulating</b> <b>bacteria</b> belonging to the B. cereus group (30). B. anthracis is highly virulent to mammal...|$|R
40|$|The aspartic transcarbamylase (ATCase) {{activity}} of Bacillus subtilis cells disappears rapidly from stationary-phase cells prior to sporulation. ATCase activity {{does not appear}} in the culture fluid during the stationary phase; hence the enzyme appears to be inactivated in the cells. The enzyme is inactivated normally in two different mutants lacking proteases; the activity is very stable in crude extracts of cells or in the culture fluid. These results suggest that ATCase is not inactivated by the general proteolysis that occurs in <b>sporulating</b> <b>bacteria.</b> The inactivation of ATCase can be completely inhibited after it has begun by oxygen starvation or addition of fluoroacetate. Inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation and electron transport also interrupt the inactivation of ATCase. The inactivation of ATCase is very slow in two mutant strains that are deficient in enzymes of tricarboxylic acid cycle. Addition of gluconate to stationary cultures of the mutant strains, which is known to restore depleted adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate pools in these bacteria, also restores inactivation of ATCase. These experiments support the conclusion that the generation of metabolic energy is necessary for the inactivation of ATCase in stationary cells. ATCase activity is stable in growing cells in which ATCase synthesis is repressed by addition of uracil; the enzyme is inactivated normally, however, when such cells cease growing...|$|R
40|$|Bacillus subtilis is a <b>sporulating</b> Gram-positive <b>bacterium</b> {{that lives}} {{primarily}} in the soil and associated water sources. Whilst this bacterium has been studied extensively in the laboratory, relatively {{few studies have been}} undertaken to study its activity in natural environments. The publication of the B. subtilis genome sequence and subsequent systematic functional analysis programme have provided an opportunity to develop tools for analysing the role and expression of Bacillus genes in situ. In this paper we discuss analytical approaches that are being developed to relate genes to function in environments such as the rhizosphere...|$|R
40|$|Using mixed-species cultures, we have {{undertaken}} {{a study of}} interactions between two common spore-forming soil bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces coelicolor. Our experiments demonstrate {{that the development of}} aerial hyphae and spores by S. coelicolor is inhibited by surfactin, a lipopeptide surfactant produced by B. subtilis. Current models of aerial development by <b>sporulating</b> <b>bacteria</b> and fungi postulate a role for surfactants in reducing surface tension at air-liquid interfaces, thereby removing the major barrier to aerial growth. S. coelicolor produces SapB, an amphipathic peptide that is surface active and required for aerial growth on certain media. Loss of aerial hyphae in developmental mutants can be rescued by addition of purified SapB. While a surfactant from a fungus can substitute for SapB in a mutant that lacks aerial hyphae, not all surfactants have this effect. We show that surfactin is required for formation of aerial structures on the surface of B. subtilis colonies. However, in contrast to this positive role, our experiments reveal that surfactin acts antagonistically by arresting S. coelicolor aerial development and causing altered expression of develop-mental genes. Our observations support the idea that surfactants function specifically for a given organism regardless of their shared ability to reduce surface tension. Production of surfactants with antagonistic activity could provide a powerful competitive advantage during surface colonization and in competition for resources. Microbial populations in natural settings almost invariabl...|$|R
