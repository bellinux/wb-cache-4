25|$|The ISS is {{equipped}} with approximately 100 IBM and Lenovo ThinkPad model A31 and T61P laptop computers. Each computer is a commercial off-the-shelf purchase which is then modified for <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> including updates to connectors, cooling and power to accommodate the station's 28V DC power system and weightless environment. Heat generated by the laptops does not rise but stagnates around the laptop, so additional forced ventilation is required. Laptops aboard the ISS {{are connected to the}} station's wireless LAN via Wi-Fi and to the ground via Ku band. This provides speeds of 10Mbit/s to and 3Mbit/s from the station, comparable to home DSL connection speeds.|$|E

40|$|Alternatives to the {{traditional}} concepts for real time health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>operations</b> were examined. The pitfalls of the conventional contingency planning for health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> are highlighted. The Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) contingency planning <b>and</b> <b>operations</b> provides the evolution from the conventional people intensive health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>operation,</b> toward a night watchman mode of operations. The SMM spacecraft health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>operations</b> were budget constrained {{to the point that}} one operator was responsible for the health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> of the entire spacecraft one week after launch. The spacecraft was a protoflight with brand new subsystem configurations, software and procedures. To manage the risks associated with this one man SMM health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>operation,</b> the real time contingency planning <b>and</b> <b>operations</b> centered around unambiguously identifying a system level problem, and reactively safing components susceptible to unrecoverable damage. The methodology applied to both analyzing and implementing this approach of SMM is shown...|$|R
50|$|The primary {{users of}} RMIS are risk/insurance {{departments}} of insured organizations and any insurance broker involved. Interestingly, {{it is much}} less common for the insured's <b>safety</b> department <b>and</b> vehicle <b>operations</b> department {{to have access to}} RMIS despite similar interest in the data. In fact, <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> vehicle <b>operations</b> of larger organizations typically maintain their own separate database systems of “accidents/incidents,” many of which will correlate to RMIS claim data.|$|R
50|$|This {{locomotive}} came to {{the railway}} in 2008 and whilst it was built by Schöma in Germany, the railway acquired it after {{the construction of the}} Channel Tunnel between England and France, meaning this locomotive is the youngest in the railway's fleet. Edward is a three-cylinder air-cooled diesel engine, weighing at around 4.5 tons. Originally in a white livery, but has since been repainted, and both doors and windows have been added for better <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Valparaiso, Chile, has fifteen funiculars, {{the oldest}} dating from 1883. Some {{of them are}} inside the {{historic}} quarter, which has been declared a World Heritage area by UNESCO. Many are currently in disrepair and have been shut down by municipal authorities. There has been recent controversy regarding five of the elevators in the downtown area, where there have been protests about <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation.</b> The Polanco Elevator, perhaps the most unusual, had been closed for repairs to the structure and recently re-entered service.|$|E
5000|$|Strategies for {{managing}} lanes typically fall {{into one of}} three categories. These include vehicle eligibility restrictions, access control, and pricing. Most managed lane implementation incorporate the application of multiple management strategies. In the United States, managed lanes are almost always located within the right-of-way of freeways, often on the left or [...] "high speed" [...] side of the mainlanes, but sometimes on the right lane or shoulder lane for short distances. Agencies often combine lane management strategies and applications of various intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and traffic control devices to address both <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> needs.

Students can use the cards to check in when they enter their school or sign into class, just by tapping their card against an NFC-enabled phone or kiosk. Previously, these cards could only be read at permanent kiosks equipped with OMNIKEY RFID readers.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, {{the number of}} {{substandard}} ships entering U.S. ports posed increased threats to maritime commerce and environment. In response, the Coast Guard began a concerted port state control effort in 1994 to ensure ships calling in U.S. ports met international standards for <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>operations.</b> Largely due {{to the success of}} what {{came to be known as}} the Coast Guard's Port State Control (PSC) program, the IMO adopted new standards to expand the authority of port states when conducting safety inspections onboard foreign vessels.|$|R

50|$|The 1987 census {{showed that}} the island {{population}} stood at 5,644. The Development & Economic Planning Department, which still operates, was formed in 1988 to contribute to raising the living standards {{of the people of}} St Helena by planning and managing sustainable economic development through education, participation and planning, improving decision making by providing statistical information and by improving the <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> of the wharf and harbour operations.

5000|$|The {{pilot in}} command (PIC) of an {{aircraft}} is the person aboard the aircraft who is ultimately responsible for its operation and safety during flight. This would be the captain in a typical two- or three-pilot aircrew, or [...] "pilot" [...] if {{there is only one}} certificated and qualified pilot at the controls of an aircraft. The PIC must be legally certificated (or otherwise authorized) to operate the aircraft for the specific flight and flight conditions, but need not be actually manipulating the controls at any given moment. The PIC is the person legally in charge of the aircraft and its flight <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation,</b> and would normally be the primary person liable for an infraction of any flight rule.|$|E
