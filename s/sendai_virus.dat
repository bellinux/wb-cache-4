5|$|Several diseases, like Rat Coronavirus Infection (RCI), <b>Sendai</b> <b>virus,</b> and Murine Respiratory Mycoplasmosis (MRM, Mycoplasma pulmonis), are {{prevalent}} {{simply because}} their highly contagious natures work {{in tandem with}} the way rats are kept in laboratories, pet stores, and by breeders.

25|$|One {{recognized}} {{feature of}} the <b>Sendai</b> <b>virus,</b> shared with members of its genus, {{is the ability to}} induce syncytia formation in vitro in eukaryotic colonies. The mechanism for this process is fairly well understood and is very similar to the fusion process employed by the virion to facilitate cellular entry. The activities of the receptor binding hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein is solely responsible for inducing close interaction between the virus envelope and the cellular membrane.|$|E

Under appropriate conditions a complete inactivation of all the viruses was observed. Oxidized spermidine was also inhibitory, but at higher concentrations. Completely inactivated Newcastle disease and <b>Sendai</b> <b>viruses</b> agglutinated red blood cells in vitro and fused Ehrlich ascites cells.

25|$|This {{behavior}} of SeV was utilized by Köhler and Milstein, who {{published an article}} in 1975 outlining a revolutionary method of manufacturing monoclonal antibodies. In need of a reliable method to produce large quantities of a specific antibody, the two merged a monoclonal B cell, exposed to a chosen antigen, and a myeloma tumor cell to produce hybridomas, capable of being grown indefinitely and of producing significant amounts of an antibody specifically targeting the chosen antigen. Though more efficient methods of creating such hybrids have since been found, Köhler and Milstein first used <b>Sendai</b> <b>virus</b> to create their revolutionary cells.|$|E
25|$|In {{a natural}} setting, the {{respiratory}} infection of <b>Sendai</b> <b>virus</b> in mice is acute. From the extrapolation of the infection of laboratory mice, {{the presence of}} the virus may first be detected in the lungs 48 to 72 hours following exposure. As the virus replicates in the respiratory tract of an infected mouse, the concentration of the virus grows most quickly during the third day of infection. After that, the growth of the virus is slower but consistent. Typically, the peak concentration of the virus is on the sixth or seventh day, and rapid decline follows that by the ninth day. A fairly vigorous immune response mounted against the virus is the cause of this decline. The longest period of detected presence of the virus in a mouse lung is fourteen days after infection.|$|E

40|$|H- 2 {{dependent}} and virus-specific Ir genes regulate {{the generation of}} primary virus-specific K or D restricted cytotoxic T-cell responses in vivo. The following examples have been analyzed in some detail: first, Dk restricted responses to vaccinia in <b>Sendai</b> <b>viruses</b> are at least 30 times lower than the corresponding K-restricted responses irrespective of the H- 2 haplotypes (k, b, d, dxs, dxq) of K and I regions; in contrast, LCMV infection generates high responses to Dk. These {{findings are consistent with}} but do not prove that this Ir gene maps to D. Second, Db restricted responses to vaccinia and <b>Sendai</b> <b>viruses</b> are high in strains possessing the Kq or KbIb, KbaIb haplotype, are very low in strains with Kk, and relatively low in mouse strains of the KdI-Ad haplotype; LCMV generates high Db restricted response in the presence of Kk. This Ir gene for the response to vaccinia and <b>Sendai</b> <b>viruses</b> maps to K since B 10. BYR (KqIkdDb) is a responder and B 10. A (2 R) is a nonresponder (KkIkdDb). Third, virus and K or D allele specific nonresponsiveness is dominant with variable penetrance; in heterozygous mice the nonresponder Kk allele over-rides responsiveness normally found in KbDb or KqDb combinations. Fourth, when (responder X nonresponder) F 1 lymphocytes are stimulated in an environment expressing vaccinia virus plus only a high responder Kb or Kq allelle and Db, response to vaccinia Db is high; in contrast when the same F 1 cells are stimulated in an environment expressing the low responder allele Kk, response to vaccinia Db is low. Thus absence of Kk during immunization allows generation of high responsive Db restricted vaccinia specific cytotoxic T cells. The Dk dependent low response to vaccinia Dk can be explained by a preclusion rule or by failure of vaccinia to complex with Db; however the analysis of Kk dependent low response to vaccinia Db does not support these explanations or that self-tolerance is responsible for this Ir effect but is compatible with the interpretation that Kk vaccinia is immunodominant over Db vaccinia. These results are discussed with respect to (a) possible mechanisms of regulation by Ir genes and (b) H- 2 polymorphism and HLA-disease association...|$|R

40|$|Oncolytic {{paramyxoviruses}} {{include some}} strains of Measles, Mumps, Newcastle disease, and <b>Sendai</b> <b>viruses.</b> All these viruses are well equipped for promoting highly specific and efficient malignant cell death, {{which can be}} direct and/or immuno-mediated. A number of proteins that serve as natural receptors for oncolytic paramyxoviruses are frequently overexpressed in malignant cells. Therefore, the preferential interaction of paramyxoviruses with malignant cells rather than with normal cells is promoted. Due to specific genetic defects of cancer cells in the interferon (IFN) and apoptotic pathways, viral replication {{has the potential to}} be promoted specifically in tumors. Viral mediation of syncytium formation (a polykaryonic structure) promotes intratumoral paramyxovirus replication and spreading, without exposure to host neutralizing antibodies. So, two related processes: efficient intratumoral infection spread as well as the consequent mass malignant cell death, both are enhanced. In general, the paramyxoviruses elicit strong anticancer innate and adaptive immune responses by triggering multiple danger signals. The paramyxoviruses are powerful inducers of IFN and other immuno-stimulating cytokines. These viruses efficiently promote anticancer activity of natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Moreover, a neuraminidase (sialidase), a component of the viral envelope of Newcastle Disease, Mumps, and <b>Sendai</b> <b>viruses,</b> can cleave sialic acids on the surface of malignant cells thereby unmasking cancer antigens and exposing them to the immune system. These multiple mechanisms contribute to therapeutic efficacy of oncolytic paramyxoviruses and are responsible for encouraging results in preclinical and clinical studies...|$|R

When foreign molecules enter cells, one must take into account the possible drawbacks and potential to cause tumorous growth. Integrating viral vectors have the chance to cause mutations when inserted into the genome.
