His American co-driver, Sergio Cresto, also died when the Lancia plunged down a ravine and exploded. The fatal crash had no close {{witnesses}} and the only remains of the car were the blackened <b>spaceframe,</b> {{making it impossible to}} determine the cause of the crash. Within hours of the crash, Jean-Marie Balestre, then President of the FISA, had banned the powerful Group B rally cars from competing the following season, ending rallying's popular supercar era.|$|E
5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy castings and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the <b>spaceframe</b> before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E

25|$|Building on Aston Martin's {{established}} {{road car}} and sports racer template, the chassis of the DBR4 was a conventional <b>spaceframe</b> structure, skinned with aluminium bodywork. Beneath the skin the DBR4's basic design was {{closely related to}} the DB3S sports car of 1956, but with its ancillary components more tightly packaged to enclose them in the smaller, single-seater body. Although some manufacturers had started to use wind-tunnel testing for racing cars, such as the Bristol 450, aerodynamics as a science was still in its infancy where road vehicles were concerned. As a result of this, although the DBR4's bodywork appeared svelte and streamlined, the effect was ruined by the decision to mount a large air intake {{on the side of the}} bonnet, and to install a relatively tall, near-vertical windscreen.|$|E
25|$|Aesthetically and aerodynamically the T51 was {{a natural}} {{development}} of the T43 and T45 cars that had given Cooper their first two wins. The Coopers continued their practice of building <b>spaceframe</b> chassis that ignored orthodox design thinking in having several curved links and the rear-engine layout meant weight savings and aerodynamic advantages over the front-engined cars, which typically had separate gearbox and differential cases, and had to find room for propshafts to the rear wheels. Also {{the location of the}} fuel tanks {{on either side of the}} cockpit rather than at the rear meant the car handled more consistently with different fuel loads, a vital factor during races which lasted up to three hours. One notable throwback, however, was the car's leaf spring rear suspension, although it used a more modern coil spring and wishbone setup at the front.|$|E
25|$|The doors, {{most often}} {{credited}} as a Lamborghini trademark, were a remarkable design feature for the Countach. They {{first appeared on}} the Alfa Romeo 33 'Carabo' concept car in 1968, an earlier design accomplishment, also by the talented Gandini. The doors {{have come to be}} known as scissor doors: hinged at the front with horizontal hinges, so that they lifted up and tilted forwards. The main reason is the car's tubular <b>spaceframe</b> chassis results in very high and wide door sills. It was also partly for style, and partly because the width of the car made conventional doors impossible to use in even slightly confined space. Care needed to be taken, though, in opening the doors with a low roof overhead. The car's poor rear visibility and wide sills led to drivers adopting a method of reversing the car for parking by opening the door, sitting on the sill, and reversing while looking over the back of the car from outside.|$|E

50|$|In the 1997 model year, the Trans Sport and its {{siblings}} {{got their}} first major redesign, ditching the one-of-a-kind construction and look {{to create a more}} conservative, conventional minivan.

The new minivans were of unibody steel construction and the styling was intentionally conventional {{to such an extent that}} contemporary reviewers remarked that without looking closely at the badging and grille treatments, these minivans could be mistaken for their primary competitors, the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, which at the time commanded a 50% share of the minivan market. During the development of this generation of the U-body minivan, General Motors extensively benchmarked the then current Chrysler minivans. The resultant vehicles more closely resembled the immensely successful trio; However, Chrysler would launch a completely redesigned minivan line a year before GM.

500|$|Tauranac {{built the}} BT19 around a mild steel <b>spaceframe</b> chassis {{similar to those}} used in his {{previous}} Brabham designs. The use of a <b>spaceframe</b> was considered a conservative design decision; by 1966, most of Brabham's competitors were using the theoretically lighter and stiffer monocoque design, introduced to Formula One by Lotus during the 1962 season. Tauranac believed that contemporary monocoques were not usefully stiffer than a well-designed <b>spaceframe</b> and were harder to repair and maintain. The latter was a particular concern for Brabham, which was the largest manufacturer of customer single-seater racing cars in the world at the time. The company's reputation rested in part on BRO ‚Äì effectively the official 'works' team ‚Äì using the same technology as its customers, for whom ease of repair was a significant consideration. One mildly novel feature was the use of oval-section, rather than round, tubing around the cockpit, where the driver sits. In a <b>spaceframe</b> or monocoque racing car, the cockpit is effectively a hole in the structure, weakening it considerably. For a given cross sectional area, oval tubing is stiffer in one direction than round tubing. Tauranac happened to have a supply of oval tubing and used it to stiffen the cockpit area. The car weighed around 1250pounds (567kg), around [...] over the minimum weight limit for the formula, although it was still one of the lightest cars in the 1966 field.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with beamlike <b>spaceframes</b> that include {{a large number of}} bistable elements, and exploit the bistability of the elements to obtain structures with multiple stable configurations. By increasing the number of bistable elements, structures with a large number of different configurations can be designed. A particular attraction of this approach is that it produces structures able to maintain their shape without any power being supplied. The first part of this paper focuses on the design and realization of a low-cost snap-through strut, whose two different lengths provide the required bistable feature. A parametric study of the length-change of the strut in relation to the peak force that needs to be applied by the driving actuators is carried out. Bistable struts based on this concept have been made by injection molding nylon. Next, beamlike structures based on different architectures are considered. It is shown that different structural architectures produce structures with workspaces of different size and resolution, when made from an identical number of bistable struts. One particular architecture, with 30 bistable struts and hence over 1 billion different configurations, has been demonstrated...|$|R

5000|$|Nota Sports and Racing Cars [...] is an {{automobile}} manufacturer in Australia. The company {{was founded by}} Guy Buckingham in 1952. He was an aircraft engineer and used his expertise to build triangulated <b>spaceframed</b> sportscars. Possibly Australia's first space-framed cars. In 1958 the company built a series of all-enveloping aluminium streamlined sports cars. First called [...] "Streamliners", and later called [...] "Mazengarbs". Up to 1960 eleven of those were made. In the late 1950s the company produced Formula Junior cars in both front and midengined formats. Nota also {{made a series of}} specialist monoposto racing cars for the track and hill climbing events. In 1963 the company made a series of Mini powered sports cars. In 1964 they started production of the Nota Sapphire an alloy bodied sports and coupe designs with Ford Fiat and Coventry Climax engines. In 1965 Nota started producing Formula Vee cars for Warrick Farm race track making 34 in the first year. In the 1960s the company formulised their [...] "Sportsman", a Lotus 7 look alike, which they still build today and are now building in a midengined version for the modern day transverse engines which the major car manufacturers produce. In 1968 came the Nota Fang Chris Buckinghams first real design, a midengined sports car using a Cooper S engine power plant behind the driver but in front of the rear wheels, their most successful model with over 100 being made. Later the Fang was equipped with Lancia engines, then Toyota engines, finally being fitted with Toyota's V6 Quad cam supercharged engines with over 400BHP. In 1973 Nota started with their Marauder range of cars using the same mechanicals as the Nota Fang. At the same time they were making the Nota Levanti front engine twin cam coupe. In 1975 the supply of Leyland 1275 GT engines started to run out so Nota contacted FIAT and both Marauders and Fangs were made with the 2-litre twin cam FIAT/Lancia engine.Leyland were then approached and the P76 engine was fitted to the Marauders using a Nota made gearbox transaxle with the gear box next to the driver and the engine behind.In the late 1970s Nota had started on 4WD 351 V8 mid-engined Marauders, but in the 1980s Ford stopped export of the 351 engine to Australia. After a trip to England Chris Buckingham assembled a design team to design a Fang with Fl 3 litre V6 quad cam engine as well as a fully enclosed, similarly specified Chimera. In 2003 Nota developed the Nota Le Mans, powered by either a Suzuki GTi 1300 cc or 1100 cc motor cycle engine. For road use it could also use a Toyota 1800 cc VVTi 6-speed or the 3.5-litre V6 quad cam. By 2012 Nota had decided that {{due to the lack of}} front engine rear wheel drive 4 cylinder engine being available they would use an existing front engined Nota clubman chassis and move the seats forward by 150mm and fit a transverse engine behind the driver. It looks just like their front engined clubmans but with the advantage of a midengined design.|$|R

However, to support this skin, rather than using traditional bulkheads and metal ribs, Maddock specified a lining of aviation-grade honeycomb structure aluminium with a fibreglass inner skin, forming a sandwich structured composite. The resulting chassis (sometimes referred to as the Cooper T69) was far stiffer than previous Cooper products, but with variable wall thicknesses and bonded-in fuel cells it was complex to manufacture.
