At the next owners' meeting, Rooney admonished they either had to {{recognize}} the NFLPA or remove Bell as commissioner. In order to do this, they had to agree in a vote that required a super-majority. Bell unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the owners to permit the NFLPA to act as a bargaining agent for the players. However, he did reach a compromise with the owners to get them to acquiesce to some of the NFLPA's requests for salary standards and health benefits.|$|E

Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) details an idea he has about cookie placement in the vending machine, but Robert gets the impression that he is extremely clever and is <b>speaking</b> <b>only</b> in metaphors. Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who has been annoyed the entire day with Kevin being creative and Robert rejecting his ideas, later tricks Kevin into explaining an idea he has involving the Big Mac, and Robert realizes that there was no subtext to Kevin's ideas.|$|E
5|$|Suzuki's working {{title for}} this second {{autobiography}} was The Outsider, a title intended {{to express the}} author's view of his own role in society. The origin of this outsider feeling comes from isolation suffered at a Japanese Canadian internment camp during World War II. He was imprisoned there for being Japanese but shunned by other Japanese for being a third generation Canadian, <b>speaking</b> <b>only</b> English. His feeling of isolation continued during his early school years when the only other student of Japanese heritage was his twin sister. Suzuki's daughters acknowledged this perception of himself as an outsider but insist that the public views him very differently, {{as one of their}} own, leading to the simple The Autobiography title.|$|E

5|$|According to the 2006 Canadian census, {{there were}} 10,994 {{people living in}} 4,650 {{households}} within the city (the official provincial estimate was 11,093 people). Of the federally surveyed households, 33% were one-person households, slightly above the 28% average provincewide; households consisting of couples with children, at 26%, were {{very close to the}} provincial average; and households of couples without children, at 24%, were below the provincial average of 30%. Among its 3,000 census families, Dawson Creek had a smaller proportion of married couples than the province, 62% compared to 73%, but the same average number of persons per family, 2.9. With 92% of Dawson Creek residents being Canadian-born, and 93% <b>speaking</b> <b>only</b> English, the city has few visible minorities. Only 17% of residents aged 35–64 had a university certificate or diploma, compared to the provincewide rate of 29%. Among those aged 25–64, 20% did not have a high school certificate or equivalent, much higher than the 12% provincewide rate.|$|E
5|$|According to the Bermuda Weather Service, {{the islands}} of Bermuda {{experience}} a damaging tropical cyclone once every six to seven years, on average. Due to the small area of the island chain, landfalls and direct hits are rare. Strictly <b>speaking,</b> <b>only</b> nine landfalls have occurred during years included in the official Atlantic hurricane database, starting in 1851. When hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo struck Bermuda just days apart in October 2014, that season became the first to produce two landfalls. Two damaging storms impacted Bermuda in September 1899, but {{the center of the}} first storm narrowly missed the islands. Tropical cyclones, and their antecedent or remnant weather systems, have affected the territory in all seasons, most frequently in the late summer months. A study of recorded storms from 1609 to 1996 found that direct hits from hurricanes were most common in early September and late October, with an intervening relative lull creating two distinct 'seasons'.|$|E

30|$|The {{results from}} Sections 2 and 2.1 {{indicate}} that less-acculturated Indigenous workers {{have a significant}} penalty compared to Indigenous workers who <b>speak</b> <b>only</b> Spanish or those who are Mestizos. It is clear that Indigenous workers who <b>speak</b> <b>only</b> an Indigenous language have an earnings disadvantage because the dominant language in the Mexican labor market is Spanish. But, {{it is not clear}} why Indigenous workers who <b>speak</b> <b>only</b> Spanish have an earnings advantage compared to Indigenous workers who are bilingual. Indigenous bilingual individuals speak both Spanish and an Indigenous language; hence at a minimum, there should be no significant difference in their earnings compared to the earnings of Indigenous workers who <b>speak</b> <b>only</b> Spanish. However, the results from the Census data indicate that Indigenous who <b>speak</b> <b>only</b> Spanish have a significant earnings advantage over Indigenous who speak both Spanish and an Indigenous language (see Tables 2 and 3). The results from the MxFLS are less precise but also suggest an earnings advantage for more acculturated individuals (see Tables 6 and 7).|$|R

25|$|Finally, {{cultural}} and religious conflict {{also played a role}} in fomenting discontent. In the early 1570s, Sir John Perrot, the English Lord Deputy, had banned aspects of traditional Gaelic Irish culture, including Brehon law, bardic Irish language poetry and Irish dress. In addition, the English had introduced Protestantism as the state religion in Ireland, whereas {{the majority of the population}} were Roman Catholic. This was an increasingly important proof of loyalty to the Dublin administration after the promulgation of Pope Pius V's papal bull Regnans in Excelsis in 1570, when the Papacy excommunicated Elizabeth and her officials. Fitzmaurice appealed to both of these sentiments, <b>speaking</b> <b>only</b> Irish, wearing Irish dress and also championing the cause of the counter-reformation.|$|E

He continued his schooling until twelve years of age, entering a preparatory school, near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Farenholt eventually broke off his studies believing dismissal from this institution to be in short order due to a boyish scrape, traveled to New Orleans, and shipped out to New York City aboard the American sailing ship Saint Charles. He continued sailing as a merchant sailor until the outbreak of the American Civil War.|$|E
25|$|African American Vernacular English (AAVE) is {{a variety}} (dialect, ethnolect, and sociolect) of the American English {{language}} {{closely associated with}} the speech of, but not exclusive to, African Americans. While AAVE is academically considered a legitimate dialect because of its logical structure, some of both whites and African Americans consider it slang or the result of a poor command of Standard American English. Many African Americans who were born outside the American South still speak with hints of AAVE or southern dialect. Inner-city African-American children who are isolated by <b>speaking</b> <b>only</b> AAVE sometimes have more difficulty with standardized testing and, after school, moving to the mainstream world for work. It is common for many speakers of AAVE to code switch between AAVE and Standard American English depending on the setting.|$|E

25|$|Two {{things should}} be noted about the second {{complete}} draft of Das Rheingold. Firstly, the full score of the Prelude (in ink) and the instrumentation draft of {{the remainder of the}} opera (in pencil) together constitute a single manuscript (WWV 86A Musik III). In WWV this is called a Partiturerstschrift, a term usually reserved for Wagner's full scores: strictly <b>speaking</b> <b>only</b> the section in ink is a Partiturerstschrift. Secondly, the manuscript is fragmentary: thirty-three measures are missing, which include the closing measures of the Prelude and the opening measures of Scene 1. As ink is used before this lacuna and pencil after it, it is generally assumed that Wagner switched from one medium to the other at the entrance of the voices (i.e. the first measure of Scene 1); but until and unless the missing sheets are recovered, this must remain an assumption.|$|E
25|$|Wong Kar-wai {{was born}} on 17 July 1958 in Shanghai, the {{youngest}} of three siblings. His father was a sailor {{and his mother was}} a housewife. By the time Wong was five years old, the seeds of the Cultural Revolution were beginning to take effect in China and his parents decided to relocate to British-ruled Hong Kong. The two older children were meant to join them later, but the borders closed before they had a chance and Wong did not see his brother or sister again for ten years. In Hong Kong, the family settled in the Tsim Sha Tsui district, and his father got work managing a night club. Being an only child in a new city, and <b>speaking</b> <b>only</b> Mandarin, Wong has said he felt isolated during his childhood; he struggled to learn Cantonese and English, only becoming fluent in these new languages when he was a teenager.|$|E
25|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} {{that a lot of}} the characters and indeed the town are based on Pemberton's home town of Chorley, with Royston Vasey based on Adlington, a village within Chorley Borough. The character of Herr Lipp is believed to be based on a hospital chaplain Steve Pemberton encountered after suffering a heart attack in Germany and Pauline is primarily based on a restart officer of Reece Shearsmith's. Similarly, Ollie Plimsolls is based on a community theatre actor that Shearsmith had worked with. In the DVD commentary on the second series, Pemberton and Shearsmith state that Papa Lazarou's speech patterns are based on their former landlord, who would phone their flat and insist on <b>speaking</b> <b>only</b> to Steve. Gatiss has said in interview that the local shop was inspired by a shop in the village of Rottingdean and that he was influenced growing up around the former Winterton Hospital asylum near Sedgefield.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, Rambhadracharya (then {{known as}} Rambhadradas) {{undertook}} his second six-month Payovrata, taking {{a diet of}} only milk and fruits and <b>speaking</b> <b>only</b> Sanskrit, at the Sphatik Shila in Chitrakoot. The Yuvraj of Chitrakoot, Hemraj Singh Chaturvedi, was impressed by Rambhadracharya and donated a 60 feet by 80 feet land area situated besides the Mandakini river at Janki Kund to Rambhadradas. Gita Devi, Rambhadradas's elder sister, persuaded him to get an Ashram built on this plot. Rambhadradas got four rooms constructed there and started visiting the place frequently. He undertook a nine-month Payovrata at this newly built Ashram in 1986. He also started performing his Kathas there. Ramcharandas Phalahari, the Sampradaya Guru of Rambhadradas, wanted Rambhadradas {{to stay with him}} at his Ashram in Prayag, but Rambhadradas was reluctant. In 1988, Umacharan Gupta, a businessman from Manikpur offered to build a bigger Ashram and a temple on the condition that Rambhadradas stay there permanently. Rambhadradas agreed and the construction started. On 11 March 1987, the Kanch Mandir (literally glass-temple) was opened and Rambhadradas started living permanently in Chitrakoot. Following this, on the occasion of Tulsi Jayanti on August 2, 1987, he established Tulsi Peeth {{at the site of the}} Ashram. As the founder of the seat of Tulsi, the title of Śrīcitrakūṭatulasīpīṭhādhīśvara (literally The Lord of the Tulsi Peeth at Chitrakoot) was bestowed upon Rambhadracharya by Sadhus and intellectuals. Rambhadracharya believes that this Peeth is situated at the place where, according to the epic Ramayana, the Hindu god Rama gave his sandals to his brother Bharat.|$|E
