25|$|A {{heritage}} {{turkey is}} one of a variety of strains of domestic turkey which retains historic characteristics that are no longer present in the majority of turkeys raised for consumption since the mid-20th century. Heritage turkeys can be differentiated from other domestic turkeys in that they are biologically capable of being raised in a manner that more closely matches the natural behavior and life cycle of wild turkeys. Heritage turkeys have a relatively long lifespan and a much <b>slower</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> than turkeys bred for industrial agriculture, and unlike industrially-bred turkeys, can reproduce without artificial insemination.|$|E

500|$|Gestation lasts 15 to 16 months. The {{first three}} to four months are spent with the blastula in {{suspended}} development before it implants itself in the uterus. This strategy of delayed implantation, common among pinnipeds, presumably evolved to optimize both the mating season and the birthing season, determined by ecological conditions that promote newborn survival. Calves are born during the spring migration, from April to June. They weigh [...] at birth and are able to swim. The mothers nurse for over a year before weaning, but the young can spend up to five years with the mothers. Walrus milk contains higher amounts of fats and protein compared to land animals but lower compared to phocid seals. This lower fat content in turn causes a <b>slower</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> among calves and a longer nursing investment for their mothers. Because ovulation is suppressed until the calf is weaned, females give birth at most every two years, leaving the walrus with the lowest reproductive rate of any pinniped.|$|E

50|$|Antibiotic {{action against}} a {{pathogen}} {{can be seen}} as an environmental pressure. Those bacteria with a mutation that allows them to survive will reproduce, pass the trait to their offspring, which leads to the microevolution of a fully resistant colony. Chromosomal mutations providing antibiotic resistance benefit the bacteria but also confer a cost of fitness. For example, a ribosomal mutation may protect a bacterial cell by changing the binding site of an antibiotic but will also slow protein synthesis. manifesting, in <b>slower</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
50|$|A study {{conducted}} by Botha-Brink and Angielczyk reviewed the bone histology of Permo-Triassic dicynodonts. Their findings suggest that Dicynodontoides had a <b>slower</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> than other dicynodonts. The presence of LAGs, or growth rings, in most dicynodonts indicates that growth rates decreased around sexual maturity. However, {{the presence of these}} growth rings in Dicynodontoides at only 47% adult size is significantly earlier than the general pattern. Moderately vascularized fibrolamellar bone and small, narrow vascular canals suggest a relatively decreased intake of oxygen and nutrients compared with other dicynodonts. This is consistent with the slow rate of growth of Dicynodontoides.|$|E

50|$|Computer A, {{running the}} linear search program, {{exhibits}} a linear growth rate. The program's run-time is {{directly proportional to}} its input size. Doubling the input size doubles the run time, quadrupling the input size quadruples the run-time, and so forth. On the other hand, Computer B, running the binary search program, exhibits a logarithmic growth rate. Quadrupling the input size only increases the run time by a constant amount (in this example, 50,000 ns). Even though Computer A is ostensibly a faster machine, Computer B will inevitably surpass Computer A in run-time because it's running an algorithm with a much <b>slower</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{water vapor}} {{pressure}} is increased, the oxide growth rate is increased. According {{to the model}} of Deal and Grove4, {{the growth rate of}} the oxide layer {{is directly related to the}} effective diffusion coefficient of the water molecules into the oxide layer and the equilibrium concentration in the immediate area. When a carrier gas is used to deliver water vapor, the carrier gas molecules generate a partial pressure. This partial pressure lowers the partial pressure of water vapor and slows the diffusion of water into the oxide film. The result is lower driving force and <b>slower</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Growth</b> <b>rate</b> of {{fetus is}} linear up to 37 weeks of gestation, after which it plateaus. The <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> of an embryo and infant can be {{reflected}} as the weight per gestational age, {{and is often}} given as the weight put in relation to what would be expected by the gestational age. A baby born within the normal range of weight for that gestational age is known as appropriate for gestational age (AGA). An abnormally <b>slow</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> results in the infant being small for gestational age, and, on the other hand, an abnormally large <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> results in the infant being large for gestational age. A <b>slow</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> and preterm birth are the two factors that can cause a low birth weight.

50|$|The next {{critical}} {{phase in}} a piglet's {{life is the}} time of weaning, when it is separated from the sow. The change from milk to solid feed leads to changes in the intestinal microflora and structure and thus presents a higher risk of intestinal problems. Two meta-analyses involving a total of 123 comparison, concluded that performance was better in piglets fed MOS-supplemented feed. The data also indicated that piglets, which were particularly challenged during this transition phase (showing a <b>slower</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> due to the challenge), responded particularly well to MOS supplements. Positive performance effects with MOS were also reported in later production phases, however, those effects appear to be smaller than in the very young animals.|$|E
50|$|For example, the {{bluegill}} sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) has {{the choice}} of foraging on plankton {{in the safety of}} reeds or on benthic invertebrates which are a better quality food source. When a predator (the largemouth bass) is present, smaller sunfish spend the majority of their time foraging in the reeds despite this choice reducing their food intake and seasonal growth rate. Sunfish that are too large to be eaten by the bass forage almost entirely on benthos. Although staying in the reeds means a <b>slower</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> and a longer period of being a size vulnerable to predators, for maximum survival sunfish choose to remain in the reeds feeding on plankton until they reach a certain size and then leave to feed on benthos.|$|E
