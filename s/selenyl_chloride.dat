40|$|E) -Methoxy alkenes {{derived from}} N-Boc or NCbz alpha-amino acids undergo {{stereoselective}} addition of phenyl <b>selenyl</b> <b>chloride</b> {{in the presence}} of Ti(Oi-Pr) (4) and LiCl to give the corresponding phenylselenyl aldehydes that can be easily transformed into new enantiomericalIy pure amino acids containing an aziridine ring.

40|$|Indirect spin-spin {{and direct}} dipolar {{couplings}} between the protons in Ph <b>selenyl</b> <b>chloride</b> were detd. by measuring proton NMR of solns. of. apprx. 4 wt. % of the compd. in liq. crystals of opposite diamagnetic anisotropies (Phase IV and ZLI 1167). The spectra of the coexisting orientations and those just {{above and below}} the coexistence temp. are shown. The relative proton-proton and proton-Se distances were also detected...|$|E
