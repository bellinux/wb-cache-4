5|$|Any {{counting}} formula involving vertices {{and faces}} that is valid for all planar graphs may be transformed by planar duality into an equivalent formula {{in which the}} roles of the vertices and faces have been swapped. Euler's formula, which is self-dual, is one example. Another given by Harary involves the handshaking lemma, according to which the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> degrees of the vertices of any graph equals twice the number of edges. In its dual form, this lemma states that in a plane graph, the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> numbers of sides of the faces of the graph equals twice the number of edges.|$|E

Then we extend such analysis to the alternating sums and obtain five analogous results.|$|R
5|$|Because {{these three}} surface {{energies}} form {{the sides of}} a triangle, they are constrained by the triangle inequalities, γij < γjk + γik meaning that no one of the surface tensions can exceed the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other two.

5|$|The Young–Dupré {{equation}} (Thomas Young 1805; Anthanase Dupré and Paul Dupré 1869) {{dictates that}} neither γSG nor γSL can {{be larger than}} the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other two surface energies. The consequence of this restriction is the prediction of complete wetting when γSG > γSL + γLG and zero wetting when γSL > γSG + γLG. The lack of {{a solution to the}} Young–Dupré equation is an indicator that there is no equilibrium configuration with a contact angle between 0 and 180° for those situations.|$|E
