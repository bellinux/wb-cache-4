50|$|The {{abolition}} of the museum was recommended in 1862, with several parties claiming {{that it should be}} ultimately reorganised to be broader in scope, to encompass all reas of science related to agriculture and industry, rather than simply relating to the mining subject matter. As a result of this recommendation, the museum was abolished {{to make way for the}} Royal College of Science for Ireland, which was wider in <b>sight.</b> The <b>document</b> detailing and authenticating the abolishment of the museum was appointed in February 1866, and was signed in July of the same year.|$|R

50|$|On April 10, 2016, a {{monk seal}} was spotted and photographed {{by a group}} of foreign {{exchange}} students and local bio-engineers in a creek in Manavgat District in Turkey's southern Antalya Province. According to the scientists involved in local projects to protect the animals, this was the first ever <b>documented</b> <b>sighting</b> of a monk seal swimming in a river. Possible reasons for the animal's appearance included better opportunities for hunting, as well as higher salinity levels due to lower water levels.|$|R

Chole Bay, Mafia's protected deep-water anchorage and original harbour, is studded with islands, sandbanks and beaches. The main town is Kilindoni. The stretch of water between the deltas of the Rufiji River and the island is called Mafia Channel.The popular rumours of pygmy hippo on the island were confirmed by the Tanzania Tourist Board in 2013 because of the first <b>documented</b> <b>sighting</b> by two tourists.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>documented</b> <b>sighting</b> of the Flathead Lake Monster was in 1889. James C. Kerr skippered the U.S. Grant, a lake {{steamboat}} {{that made}} its rounds in Lake Flathead. On one trip Kerr and his passengers saw what first {{appeared to be}} a log or another approaching boat in the water. After coming closer, they realized an unusually large whale-like object was coming toward them in the lake. Frightened, one of the passengers on the steamer pulled out the rifle that he was carrying. He did not kill the creature, but this sighting started the legend of the Flathead Lake Monster.|$|R

It wore no clothing, and upon his talon-like fingers were claws at least two inches long." [...] Upon further inspection he noted [...] "a coat of gray hair nearly covered his body, with {{here and there a}} spot of dirty skin showing." [...] He later stated that after he discovered the creature drinking the blood of two cougars, it threatened him with a club, and [...] "screamed the wildest, most unearthly screech".|$|R

Its eyes were deep set and hard to see, but they seemed expressionless. His face seemed pretty much devoid of hair, but there seemed to be hair along the sides of his face. His chest, shoulders, and arms were massive, especially the upper arms; easily upwards of 6 inches in diameter, perhaps much, much more. I could see he was pretty hairy, but didn't observe really how thick the body hair was. The face/head was very square; square sides and squared up chin, like a box".|$|R
50|$|Motor {{dysgraphia}} {{is due to}} deficient {{fine motor}} skills, poor dexterity, poor muscle tone, or unspecified motor clumsiness. Letter formation may be acceptable in very short samples of writing, but this requires extreme effort and an unreasonable {{amount of time to}} accomplish, and it cannot be sustained for a significant length of time, as it can cause arthritis-like tensing of the hand. Overall, their written work is poor to illegible even if copied by <b>sight</b> from another <b>document,</b> and drawing is difficult. Oral spelling for these individuals is normal, and their finger tapping speed is below normal. This shows that there are problems within the fine motor skills of these individuals. People with developmental coordination disorder may be dysgraphic. Writing is often slanted due to holding a pen or pencil incorrectly.|$|R
25|$|On 16 September 1400, Glyndŵr instigated the Welsh Revolt {{against the}} rule of Henry IV of England.

The uprising was eventually suppressed by the superior resources of the English. Glyndŵr was driven from his last strongholds in 1409, but he avoided capture and the last <b>documented</b> <b>sighting</b> of him was in 1412.

40|$|AbstractSight {{distance}} {{plays an}} important role in road traffic safety. Two types of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are utilized for the estimation of available sight distance in roads: Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) and Digital Surface Models (DSMs). DTMs, which represent the bare ground surface, are commonly used to determine available sight distance at the design stage. Additionally, the use of DSMs provides further information about elements by the roadsides such as trees, buildings, walls or even traffic signals which may reduce available <b>sight</b> distance. This <b>document</b> analyses the influence of three classes of DEMs in available sight distance estimation.

40|$|Since the 1892 {{discovery}} of the Atlantic humpback dolphin Sousa teuszii (Delphinidae), a species endemic to coastal western Africa, from a skull collected in Cameroon, not a single record has been documented from the country or neighbouring countries. Increasing concern about {{the continued existence of}} the Gulf of Guinea population of S. teuszii or “Cameroon dolphin” prompted an exploratory survey in May 2011. Shore-based effort, on foot (30. 52 ?km; 784 ?min), yielded no observations. Small boat-based surveys (259. 1 ?km; 1008 ?min) resulted in a single <b>documented</b> <b>sighting</b> of ca. 10 (8 – 12) Cameroon dolphins in shallow water off an open sandy shore near Bouandjo in Cameroon's South Region. The combination of a low encounter rate of 3. 86 individuals (100 ?km) - 1 suggesting low abundance and evidence of both fisheries-caused mortality and of habitat encroachment raises concerns about the Cameroon dolphin's long-term conservation prospect.

40|$|March 8 - 9, 2011, BANGKOK, THAILANDSri Lanka, in the {{northern}} Indian Ocean island, has a relatively narrow continental shelf and an abundance of cetacean fauna in her waters. A few vessel surveys have produced data on cetacean occurrence off {{the east and west}} coast but no similar data exists for the south. To fill this data gap vessel-based transects were carried out in 2008 / 2009 off a selected segment of the south coast. A high sighting rate was recorded and nine species were documented: Balaenoptera musculus, Balaenoptera brydei, Physeter macrocephalus, Stenella longirostris, Tursiops truncates, Pseudorca crassidens, Feresa attenuata, Orcinus orca and Globicephala macrorhynchus. Significantly the first scientifically <b>documented</b> <b>sighting</b> of O. orca anywhere in Sri Lanka's waters was recorded. Additionally blue whale feeding aggregations including mother-calf pairs were documented off southern Sri Lanka in the Austral summer.
