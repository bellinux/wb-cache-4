2500|$|Fourier-transform ion {{cyclotron}} resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry is a high-resolution technique {{that can be used}} to determine masses with high accuracy. Many applications of FTICR-MS use this mass accuracy to help determine the composition of molecules based on accurate mass. This is possible due to the mass defect of the elements. FTICR-MS is able to achieve higher levels of mass accuracy than other forms of mass spectrometer, in part, because a superconducting magnet is much more stable than radio-frequency (RF) voltage. [...] Another place that FTICR-MS is useful is in dealing with complex mixtures, such as biomass or waste liquefaction products, since the resolution (narrow peak width) allows the signals of two ions with similar mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) to be detected as distinct ions. [...] This high resolution is also useful in studying large macromolecules such as proteins with multiple charges, which can be produced by electrospray ionization. For example, attomole level of detection of two peptides has been reported. [...] These large molecules contain a distribution of isotopes that produce a series of isotopic peaks. Because the isotopic peaks are close to each other on the m/z axis, due to the multiple charges, the high resolving power of the FTICR is extremely useful. FTICR-MS is very useful in other studies of proteomics as well. It achieves exceptional resolution in both top-down and bottom-up proteomics. Electron-capture dissociation (ECD), collisional-induced dissociation (CID), and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) are all utilized to produce fragment spectra in tandem mass spectrometry experiments. Although CID and IRMPD use vibrational excitation to further dissociate peptides by breaking the backbone amide linkages, which are typically low in energy and weak, CID and IRMPD may also cause dissociation of post-translational modifications. ECD, on the other hand, allows specific modifications to be preserved. This is quite useful in analyzing phosphorylation states, O- or N-linked glycosylation, and <b>sulfating.</b>|$|E

These devices operate similar to jumper cables but do not require an additional vehicle to provide the power needed to boost the dead vehicle battery. Jump starters come in various sizes (typically rated in Amps). Most jump starters {{on the market today}} use lead-acid batteries and claim 400 to 1700 Amps ratings. The main disadvantage of lead-acid jump starters is weight, size and battery chemistry. Lead-acid jump starters can be extremely heavy and large, making them less than convenient when transporting between vehicles. Lead-acid batteries may self-discharge develop a condition called <b>sulfating,</b> which permanently loses battery capacity. It is entirely possible to destroy a new lead-acid battery within months that will require a replacement.|$|E

However, their synthesis still remains a considerable challenge. A general approach to the synthesis of sulfated carbohydrates was examined in which sulfate group is incorporated at the beginning of the syntheses as a protected sulfodiester. Towards this end, a series of sulfuryl imidazolium salts (SIS), a new class of <b>sulfating</b> agents, was prepared and examined as reagents for incorporating 2, 2, 2 -trichloroethyl-protected sulfate esters into monosaccharides. The SIS that contained a 1, 2 -dimethylimidazolium moiety proved to be a superior <b>sulfating</b> agent compared to SIS bearing no alkyl groups or bulkier alkyl groups on the imidazolium ring. Difficult O- and N- sulfations that required prolonged reaction times and a large excess of the SIS bearing a 1 -methylimidazolium group were achieved in high yield and in less time when employing less than half the 1, 2 -dimethylimidazolium derivative.
