Mastering is a crucial gateway between production and consumption and, as such, it involves technical knowledge as well as specific aesthetics.

5000|$|Contrary {{to popular}} legend that Drake dropped the album {{off in a}} plastic bag at Island Records' {{reception}} and then left without anyone realising, Drake delivered the master tapes of Pink Moon to Chris Blackwell at Island. In an interview for the Nick Drake fanzine Pynk Moon in 1996, Island's press officer David Sandison recalled that Drake's arrival at the record company had certainly not gone unnoticed, although there had been no indication that he was delivering them a new album: [...] "I saw him in reception after I came back from lunch and I was talking to somebody and I saw a figure in the corner on the bench, and I suddenly realized it was Nick. He had this big, 15 ips per second master tape box under his arm, and I said 'Have you had a cup of tea?' and he said 'Erm, yes', and I said 'Do you want to come upstairs?' and he said 'Yes, okay'. So we went upstairs into my office, which was on top of the landing, it was a landing that went into the big office with a huge round table where Chris and everybody else worked—very democratic—and there was a big Reevox (sic) and sound system there, and he just sat in my office area for about half an hour ... After about half an hour he said 'I'd better be going', and I said 'Okay, nice to see you', and he left. Now, he went down the stairs and he still had the tapes under his arm, and about an hour later the girl who worked behind the front desk called up and said 'Nick's left his tapes behind'. So I went down and it was the big sixteen-track master tape and it said NICK DRAKE PINK MOON, and I thought 'that's not an album I know'. The first thing to do was get it in the studio to make a seven and a half inch <b>safety</b> <b>copy,</b> because that was the master. So we ran off a <b>safety</b> <b>copy</b> to actually play, and I think twenty four hours later or so, it was put on the Reevox in the main room and we heard Pink Moon." ...|$|E

In order to promote and sustain a culture of safety in a healthcare organization, healthcare professionals stress the need to understand both individual and system contributions to error events. However, in Saudi Arabia, little is known about nurses 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of patient safety culture. The purpose of this research is to identify the systems factors that Registered Nurses (RNs) perceive as contributing to a culture of patient safety and to study the effects these perceptions have on nurses 2 ̆ 7 participation and engagement in the patient safety culture at King Fahad Medical City (KFMC), Saudi Arabia. King 2 ̆ 7 s conceptual system was utilized as the theoretical framework for this study. This study used a quantitative research methodology with a descriptive/correlation design. The sample of this study was registered RNs at KFMC, Saudi Arabia. The Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture (HSOPSC) instrument was used to measure perceptions of nurses on patient <b>safety</b> culture. <b>Copies</b> of the surveys were distributed to 600 RNs.

40|$|As the {{computer}} system has developed much in this highly information-oriented society, database security has become a very important problem and its backup strategies {{need to be made}} more efficiently and <b>safety.</b> The image <b>copy</b> method has been used as the most simple and dependable recovery mechanism for media failure. However, this method spends high overhead costs for massive data transmission and much processing time in the normal operation of the database. To cover such weak points, incremental and full backup methods are adopted before updated trucks reach a predetermined level. Moreover, when the number of full backup files exceeded a predetermined level, we stop incremental and full backups and switch it to the image copy. This paper applies cumulative damage model to backup of files in a database system, by putting damage shock by update, failure shock by database failure and damage by dumped files, and considers the tradeoff among overhead costs of image copy and incremental, full backup methods, and discusses analytically an optimal policy for the image copy backup interval.

However, the intrinsic self-renewal and pluripotency of ES and iPS cells make them tumorigenic, and hence, the risk of tumor development hinders their clinical application. Here, we present a novel approach to limit their tumorigenicity and increase their <b>safety</b> through increased <b>copy</b> number of tumor suppressors. iPS containing an extra copy of the p 53 or Ink 4 a/ARF locus show normal pluripotency, as determined by in vitro and in vivo differentiation assays. Yet, while retaining full pluripotency, they also possess an improved engagement of the p 53 pathway during teratocarcinoma formation, which leads to a reduced tumorigenic potential in various in vitro and in vivo assays. Furthermore, they show an improved response to anticancer drugs, which could aid in their elimination in case tumors arise with no adverse effects on cell function or aging. Our system provides a model for studying tumor suppressor pathways during reprogramming, differentiation, and cell therapy applications. This offers an improved understanding of the pathways involved in tumor growth from engrafted pluripotent stem cells, which could facilitate the use of ES and iPS cells in regenerative medicine...|$|R

In 2002, there were 42, 815 fatalities and over 2. 9 million injuries on the nation's highways. Crashes on rural roads (roads in areas with populations of less than 5, 000) account for over 60 percent of the deaths nationwide, or about 70 deaths each day. Further, the rate of fatalities per vehicle mile traveled on rural roads was over twice the urban fatality rate. GAO identified (1) the factors contributing to rural road fatalities, (2) federal and state efforts to improve safety on the nation's rural roads, and (3) the challenges that may hinder making improvements in rural road safety. GAO obtained information from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and other organizations with knowledge of these issues. In addition, GAO analyzed fatal crash data on rural roads from Department of Transportation databases and visited five states that account for about 20 percent of the nation's rural road mileage.

5000|$|Documents, {{obtained}} {{by a major}} Japanese newspaper, The Mainichi Daily News, after many official information requests, showed that the Japan Nuclear Energy <b>Safety</b> Organization (JNES) <b>copied</b> an inspection manual from an original provided by a supplier of fuel-rods: Global Nuclear Fuel Japan Co. This very company was subject to JNES investigations. The faulty manual was copied almost completely, even the layout was not altered, and the errors in it were missed. At first JNES deputy head of inspections Masaharu Kudo told the newspaper: [...] "we do receive data (from Global Nuclear Fuel), but of course we don't use it as-is. The JNES checks the data and produces its own manual as well." [...] After two official requests the newspaper received the originals the JNES manual and the documents of Global Nuclear Fuel document, Kudo did admit that the documents were indeed identical, {{but he could see}} any problem, because JNES and the nuclear fuel firm need to consult each other about the inspection procedures. [...] "The JNES would have no access to the necessary data without the nuclear fuel maker, so we ask them to cooperate," [...] Kudo continued. [...] "It wouldn't be impossible for the JNES to draw up the manuals independently, but if we tried we'd be at it all day." [...] The inspection procedures were obtained from Global Nuclear Fuel in September 2008, and on 18 December 2009 JNES inspected the fuel that was meant for the Higashidori nuclear plant, the manual used was copied directly from the Global Nuclear Fuel documents. Furthermore, JNES staff noticed later that the minimum fuel rod length already reported to the government was 3 to 5 centimeters longer than the value listed in both the inspection manual and the Global Nuclear Fuel draft procedures. The staff had not looked into the manual, but compared the rod with another rod, before all rods were certified. In February 2009 the error in the manual was found. Just before the certification was reported to the government. Later JNES found that it had made the same mistake three times before with the inspections of fuel-rods produced by Global Nuclear Fuel. The examiners failed to notice the mistakes as they did not closely check the manual beforehand. NISA said JNES was ordered to make the corrections needed and also to improve its screening procedures.|$|R
