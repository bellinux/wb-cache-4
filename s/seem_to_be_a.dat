5|$|The Book of Kells {{contains}} {{the text of}} the four Gospels based on the Vulgate. It does not, however, contain a pure copy of the Vulgate. There are numerous differences from the Vulgate, where Old Latin translations are used in lieu of Jerome's text. Although such variants are common in all the insular Gospels, there does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> consistent pattern of variation amongst the various insular texts. Evidence suggests that when the scribes were writing the text they often depended on memory rather than on their exemplar.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} breed traits which may cause concern as health issues. They include skull {{issues such as}} an open fontanelle, where in young dogs there is a soft spot in the skull; it is common in dogs under a year old. A {{complication}} from that condition is hydrocephalus, also known as water on the brain. This condition may cause neurological symptoms that require the dog to be euthanised. Fused toes, where {{two or more of}} the dog's toes are fused together, may <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> health issue but this breed trait is not a cause for concern.|$|E
5|$|The Finns {{had many}} reasons {{to turn down the}} Soviet proposals. Finland had started {{negotiations}} for a military co-operation with Sweden, and the Finns had great hopes for the joint Finnish–Swedish defense for the Ålands islands {{and did not want to}} jeopardize these negotiations. In addition, the violent collectivization, purges, show trials and executions in Stalin's Soviet Union had given the country a bad reputation. Furthermore, most of the Finnish Communist leadership in the Soviet Union was executed during the Great Purge. The Soviet Union did not therefore <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> reliable contracting party. The Soviet envoys sent to negotiate with Finns were officially of relatively low rank, but as Väinö Tanner put it later, the Finns assumed rightly that they represented of some higher organ of State, probably the Soviet secret police NKVD.|$|E

5|$|Though Dhumavati may <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> goddess to {{be avoided}} due to her inauspiciousness, she is {{described}} as tender-hearted and one who gives her devotees whatever they want. In several places, Dhumavati {{is described as a}} giver of siddhis (supernatural powers), a rescuer from all troubles and granter of all desires and rewards, including ultimate knowledge and moksha (salvation). Dhumavati's worship is prescribed to ward off all the negativity that she stands for and to transcend the smoke screen to acquire true knowledge. By worshipping and confronting her, the embodiment of the impure, the inauspicious and outside the fringes of society, one can look beyond the arbitrary dichotomies of society and acquire ultimate knowledge to become spiritually enlightened.|$|E
5|$|Just before junior prom, Jesse returns, having flunked out of UCLA, and Rachel invites him to {{the prom}} with her, Sam and Mercedes (Amber Riley). Jesse and Finn are {{kicked out of the}} prom when Finn picks a fight with Jesse over his attentions to Rachel on the dance floor, which {{effectively}} ends Finn and Quinn's campaign for prom king and queen. Finn ultimately breaks up with Quinn when he realizes he has a deeper connection with Rachel, {{despite the fact that she}} and Jesse <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> couple again. At Nationals, as the New Directions are about to go on stage, Finn begs Rachel to get back together with him, but though she professes her love, she refuses, still torn between her love for New York and Broadway and her love for him. At the end of their duet—"Pretending", written by Finn—an enthusiastic audience falls silent when Rachel and Finn share an overlong, unscripted kiss; the glee club comes in twelfth. Back in Ohio, Finn reminds Rachel that she has a year until graduation and any move to New York; he kisses her, and their relationship resumes.|$|E

25|$|Light {{sources and}} illuminants may be {{characterized}} by their spectral power distribution (SPD). The relative SPD curves provided by many manufacturers may have been produced using 10nm increments or more on their spectroradiometer. The result is what would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> smoother ("fuller spectrum") power distribution than the lamp actually has. Owing to their spiky distribution, much finer increments are advisable for taking measurements of fluorescent lights, and this requires more expensive equipment.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of {{pregnancy}} result, IVF treatment is usually stressful for patients.

A negative pregnancy test after IVF is associated with an increased risk for depression in women, but not with any increased risk of developing anxiety disorders. Pregnancy test results do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> risk factor for depression or anxiety among men.|$|E

25|$|Abnormally {{low levels}} of {{cholesterol}} are termed hypocholesterolemia. Research into the causes of this state is relatively limited, but some studies suggest a link with depression, cancer, and cerebral hemorrhage. In general, the low cholesterol levels <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> consequence, rather than a cause, of an underlying illness. A genetic defect in cholesterol synthesis causes Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, which {{is often associated with}} low plasma cholesterol levels. Hyperthyroidism, or any other endocrine disturbance which causes upregulation of the LDL receptor, may result in hypocholesterolemia.|$|E
25|$|There {{does not}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{researched}} history of sprung floors. There {{would not have}} been much perceived need until recently, when concrete slabs started being generally used for sub-floors. Before then floors were mainly either earthen or used wood on joists, both of which provide some cushioning from shocks. Early sprung floors often used leaf or coil springs, whence the name; these floors tended to bounce, but modern floors have suppressed this 'trampoline' effect and so are often called semi-sprung.|$|E

On the battlefield, the Hasharii act as assassins, seeking out enemy leaders and slaying them with poisoned blades.
