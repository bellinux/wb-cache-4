5|$|Growing in {{woodland}} among moss, {{plant detritus}} or other habitats, the L.lubrica fruit bodies are typically found in large numbers, though they can grow in tight clumps or even individually. The species feeds as a <b>saprotroph.</b> The youngest fruit bodies {{are small and}} conical, but the fertile head quickly grows from the stalk. It {{is often described as}} inedible, despite its common name, but has also been reported as edible and even good. L.lubrica has been recorded in Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia.|$|E
5|$|Leotia lubrica favours damp {{deciduous}} woodland, but {{can also}} be found under conifers. Particular favoured habitats include path sides and underneath bracken, while favoured substrates include soil, moss and plant waste, where it feeds as a <b>saprotroph.</b> Fruit bodies are typically encountered from late summer to late autumn in Europe, and from late spring to autumn in North America, where it is the most common Leotia species. It has also been recorded in eastern Asia, in China and Tibet, as well as in New Zealand and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{has been}} {{recorded}} growing on the fallen wood of oaks of the subgenus Cyclobalanopsis, {{as well as the}} wood of other flowering plants. The species favours the trunks of trees, where it feeds as a <b>saprotroph,</b> causing white rot. P.ellipsoideus fruit bodies are perennial growers, allowing them to, in the correct circumstances, grow very large. The species is found in the tropical and subtropical areas of China; it {{has been recorded}} in Fujian Province and Hainan Province. It is not a common species, and fruit bodies are only occasionally encountered.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>saprotrophs</b> and biotrophs {{were found}} in the Rhynie Chert, but there is little {{evidence}} to support either hypothesis.|$|R
50|$|All fungi {{within the}} family are wood-rotting <b>saprotrophs,</b> growing on dead {{attached}} branches of trees and shrubs. Distribution is cosmopolitan.|$|R
50|$|Most fungi {{within the}} order are ectomycorrhizal, forming {{mutually}} beneficial associations with certain trees, shrubs, and other vascular plants. Species in the Botryobasidiaceae {{are believed to}} be <b>saprotrophs</b> of fallen wood and leaf litter. Species in the Ceratobasidiaceae are also <b>saprotrophs,</b> but some are capable of becoming facultative plant pathogens. Species in the Tulasnellaceae are saprotrophic, but are also associated with orchid mycorrhiza, as are some species in the Ceratobasidiaceae. Distribution is cosmopolitan.|$|R
5|$|Typhula quisquiliaris fruit {{bodies are}} {{typically}} found in rows, growing from plant detritus. The species favours bracken, especially Pteridium aquilinum, but the colonisation of dead matter from other plants is not unknown. Upon these substrates, it feeds as a <b>saprotroph,</b> {{breaking down the}} dead organic matter in order to sustain itself. The species has been recorded in Europe and northern Africa. In Europe, the fruit bodies can be encountered from April to December.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{organism}} {{present in}} Rhynie {{was probably a}} fungus, the enigmatic Prototaxites, growing as a mound a metre or more taller {{than anything in the}} community, whose isotopic composition varied like a <b>saprotroph</b> and whose septate pores resemble those of fungi.|$|E
25|$|Like all Leucocoprinus species, L.birnbaumii is a <b>saprotroph,</b> {{living on}} very decayed plant matter (humus or compost). The fungus is common {{throughout}} the tropics and subtropics, extending into warmer {{parts of the}} temperate zones. Rarely, it appears in cooler areas, fruit bodies having been recorded {{as far north as}} England, but these seem to be temporary introductions. In these areas (such as North America, Europe, and Australia) it is more usually found in hothouses and plant pots than in the wild.|$|E
50|$|All {{species of}} Volvopluteus are <b>saprotrophs,</b> and grow terrestrially in gardens, grassy fields (in or outside forests) and on accumulations of {{vegetable}} matter (compost, wood chips).|$|R
50|$|Most {{species of}} the Entomophthorales are {{pathogens}} of insects. A few attack nematodes, mites, and tardigrades, and some (particularly {{species of the}} genus Conidiobolus) are free-living <b>saprotrophs.</b>|$|R
50|$|All species {{within the}} Auriculariaceae {{are thought to}} be <b>saprotrophs,</b> most of them wood-rotters {{typically}} found on dead attached or fallen wood. As a group, their distribution is cosmopolitan. According to a 2008 estimate, the Auriculariaceae contain 7 genera and over 100 species.|$|R
500|$|The {{mushroom}} {{grows in}} lawns, pastures and prairies. It is a <b>saprotroph,</b> living on decaying plant material, and not mycorrhizal {{as is the}} case with [...] Amanita species. [...] Previously it was placed in Amanita, but in 2016 the saprophytic members of that genus were separated off into the new genus Saproamanita by one research group, though this split is controversial. Fruit bodies appear during July and August, either in isolation or in groups, and often form fairy rings. The genome of A.thiersii is being sequenced as part of the United States Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute Community Sequencing Program. It is hoped that this will provide a better understanding of the cellulose decomposition capabilities of the fungus. The toxicity of A.thiersii has not been studied but it is suspected of being poisonous.|$|E
500|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus (formerly Fomitiporia ellipsoidea) is {{a species}} of polypore fungus in the family Hymenochaetaceae, a {{specimen}} of which produced the largest fungal fruit body ever recorded. Found in China, the fruit bodies produced by the species are brown, woody basidiocarps that grow on dead wood, where the fungus feeds as a <b>saprotroph.</b> The basidiocarps are perennial, allowing them to grow very large under favourable circumstances. They are resupinate, measuring [...] or more in length, though typically extending less than a centimetre {{from the surface of}} the wood. P.ellipsoideus produces distinct ellipsoidal spores, after which it is named, and unusual setae. These two features allow it to be readily differentiated microscopically from other, similar species. Chemical compounds isolated from the species include several steroidal compounds. These may have pharmacological applications, but further research is needed.|$|E
2500|$|Saprolegnia, {{like most}} oomycetes, {{is both a}} <b>saprotroph</b> and necrotroph. [...] Typically feeding on waste from fish or other dead cells, they will also take {{advantage}} of creatures that have been injured. An infection is known as oomycosis ...|$|E
50|$|All fungi {{within the}} family are wood-rotting <b>saprotrophs,</b> growing on dead {{attached}} branches of trees and shrubs. Distribution is exclusively temperate, Cytidia and Vuilleminia species being found in the northern hemisphere and Australovuilleminia species in the southern. Only 12 species are currently included {{within the family}}.|$|R
50|$|For this reason, Pythium spp. {{are more}} devastating in the root rot they cause in crops, because crop {{rotation}} alone often does not eradicate the pathogen (nor does fallowing the field, as Pythium spp. {{are also good}} <b>saprotrophs,</b> and survive {{for a long time}} on decaying plant matter).|$|R
50|$|The Botryobasidiaceae are {{a family}} of fungi in the order Cantharellales. The family {{contains}} a group of corticioid fungi that form thin, web-like basidiocarps. Some species form asexual anamorphs producing chlamydospores. All {{are believed to be}} wood-rotting or litter-rotting <b>saprotrophs.</b> None is known to be of any economic importance.|$|R
2500|$|Ganoderma lucidum, and {{its close}} {{relative}} Ganoderma tsugae, {{grow in the}} northern Eastern Hemlock forests. [...] These two species of bracket fungus have a worldwide distribution in both tropical and temperate geographical regions, growing as a parasite or <b>saprotroph</b> {{on a wide variety}} of trees. [...] Similar species of Ganoderma have been found growing in the Amazon.|$|E
2500|$|Ceratobasidium cornigerum is {{probably}} cosmopolitan {{and has been}} reported from Asia, Australia, Europe, North & South America. It occurs as a soil <b>saprotroph,</b> producing basidiocarps on dead stems and fallen litter, but is also a facultative plant pathogen causing disease of crops and turf grass. It can also grow as a [...] "web blight" [...] pathogen on living leaves of trees and shrubs, particularly in the tropics and subtropics. It {{is one of the}} commonest endomycorrhizal associates of terrestrial orchids.|$|E
2500|$|Aphanoascus fulvescens is a mould fungus that behaves as a keratinophilic <b>saprotroph</b> and {{belongs to}} the Ascomycota. It is readily {{isolated}} from soil and dung containing keratin-rich tissues that have been separated from their animal hosts. This organism, distributed worldwide, is most commonly found in areas of temperate climate, in keeping with its optimal growth temperature of [...] While A.fulvescens is recognized as a geophilic fungal species, {{it is also a}} facultative opportunistic pathogen. Although it is not a dermatophyte, A.fulvescens has occasionally been shown to cause onychomycosis infections in humans. Its recognition in the laboratory is clinically important for correct diagnosis and treatment of human dermal infections.|$|E
50|$|Most fungi {{within the}} order are <b>saprotrophs</b> of dead wood, but some species within the Hymenochaetaceae can cause rots of living trees. Species of Coltricia and Coltriciella are ectomycorrhizal. Agaricoid species of Rickenella and related genera are parasites of mosses and liverworts. Distribution of the Hymenochaetales is cosmopolitan.|$|R
5000|$|The larvae of Diptera feed on {{a diverse}} array of {{nutrients}} often these {{are different from those}} of adults, for instance the larvae of Syrphidae in which family the adults are flower-feeding are <b>saprotrophs,</b> eating decaying plant or animal matter, or insectivores, eating aphids, thrips, and other plant-sucking insects.|$|R
50|$|According to a 2008 estimate, the Botryobasidiaceae {{contains}} around 80 species worldwide. Species {{are assumed}} to be wood- and litter-rotting <b>saprotrophs</b> and are typically found on the undersides of fallen, rotting branches in woodland leaf litter. Basidiocarps are thin and ephemeral. None is known to be of any economic importance.|$|R
2500|$|Aphanoascus fulvescens is {{commonly}} found in the soil and in dung, living as a keratinophilic <b>saprotroph.</b> It is also often isolated from keratin-rich tissues such as hair and nails that have been discarded from the host. [...] A.fulvescens is a geophilic fungus and therefore does not normally infect mammals. The organism is more commonly isolated from soil that has been inhabited frequently by animals than soil that has not. However, while this fungus is not a true dermatophyte, it is opportunistic and has been seen to cause dermatophytosis in humans and other mammals on occasion. A.fulvescens has a worldwide distribution, however it is more frequently isolated in temperate climates. This is because the organism has optimal growth at 28 °C at which it grows 3–4mm per day and up to 25mm per week. At elevated temperatures, {{such as that of}} the human body (37 °C), A.fulvescens shows restricted growth, averaging only 5–6mm of growth over the course of seven days. This may be a possible explanation as to why infections involving A.fulvescens are uncommon in humans and other mammals.|$|E
2500|$|P.destructans is a psycrophilic fungus, {{able to grow}} below [...] {{and with}} an upper limit near [...] This fungus {{produces}} brown and grey colonies, secretes a brownish pigment and reproduces asexually via characteristically curved conidia when cultured on Sabaouraud dextrose agar. The asymmetrically curved conidia are produced at the tips or sides singly or in short chains. Arthroconidia can be present and undergo rhexolytic separation. Research has shown that P.destructans grows optimally between , with an upper growth limit of about [...] The in vitro growth rate of P.destructans {{is reported to be}} very slow; however, several studies have shown that not all P.destructans isolates grow at the same rate. P.destructans grows as an opportunistic pathogen on bats, causing white-nose syndrome, but it can also persist in the cave environment, as a <b>saprotroph.</b> P.destructans can grow and sporulate (reproduce asexually via conidiation) on keratinaceous, chitinaceous, cellulosic, and lipid/protein rich substrates including dead fish, mushroom fruit bodies and dead insects. P.destructans has been shown to utilize many nitrogen sources: nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, urea, and uric acid. Although P.destructans can penetrate senescing moss cells, cellulosic debris may not be a long term substrate for colonization. P.destructans can tolerate elevated levels of environmental inhibitory sulfur compounds (cysteine, sulfite, and sulfide), grow over a wide pH range (pH 5-11), tolerate elevated environmental levels of calcium; however, P.destructans was found to be intolerant to matrix-induced water stress.|$|E
50|$|As matter {{decomposes}} {{within a}} medium {{in which a}} <b>saprotroph</b> is residing, the <b>saprotroph</b> breaks such matter down into its composites.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} nitrogen-rich sources, <b>saprotrophs</b> require {{combined}} protein {{for the creation}} of proteins, which is facilitated by the absorption of amino acids, and usually taken from rich soil. Although both ions and vitamins are rare, thiamine or ions such as potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium aid the growth of the mycelium.|$|R
50|$|Many Microfungi {{species are}} benign, {{existing}} as soil <b>saprotrophs,</b> for example, largely unobserved by humans. Many thousands of microfungal species occur in lichens, forming symbiotic relationships with algae. Other microfungi, {{such as those}} of the genera Penicillium, Aspergillus and Neurospora, were first discovered as molds causing spoilage of fruit and bread.|$|R
5000|$|Slower {{decomposition}} {{rates in}} monodominant forests have been hypothesized to {{be a result}} of competition between saprotrophic bacteria and fungi. ECM fungi may be suppressing <b>saprotrophs</b> in the monodominant forest to slow decomposition and return organically bound nutrients back to the tree. This is also called the [...] "Gadgil" [...] hypothesis.|$|R
