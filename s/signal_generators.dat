Seven is led out for the next Tsunkatse match, and discovers that the Hirogen himself is her opponent. As they start to fight, Voyager attacks the Tsunkatse vessel and destroys a localized shield generator. Torres transports Tuvok off the ship, but Seven isn't in the unshielded area of the ship. The Hirogen takes the advantage in the match, and Voyager weapons are taken offline. Janeway arrives in the Delta Flyer and destroys the Tsunktase ship's <b>signal</b> <b>generators</b> which broadcast the matches. Penk reroutes power to another transmitter, thus weakening his shields. As Seven takes her position to reluctantly kill the Hirogen, both are transported onto Voyager. Afterwards, Chakotay tells the Hirogen that they are en route to transfer him to a vessel of his species. The Hirogen thanks the crew and tells them that he plans to look for his son.|$|E
25|$|Three single-degree-of-freedom {{gyroscopes}} {{have their}} input axes aligned along an orthogonal inertial coordinate system. Three <b>signal</b> <b>generators,</b> {{fixed to the}} output axis of each gyro, generated electrical signals proportional to the torque disturbances. The signals were transmitted through the servo electronics which terminated in the gimbal pivot servotorque motors. The servoloops maintained the inner gimbal rotationally fixed in inertial space. That is, while the vehicle rolled, pitched, and yawed, the inner gimbal remained in the same attitude to which it was set just before launch. Though it was being translated during the launch and orbit process, it was rotationally fixed.|$|E
2500|$|FM {{synthesis}} (frequency modulation synthesis) is {{a process}} that usually involves the use of at least two <b>signal</b> <b>generators</b> (sine-wave oscillators, commonly referred to as [...] "operators" [...] in FM-only synthesizers) to create and modify a voice. [...] Often, this is done through the analog or digital generation of a signal that modulates the tonal and amplitude characteristics of a base carrier signal. FM synthesis was pioneered by John Chowning, who patented the idea and sold it to Yamaha. [...] Unlike the exponential relationship between voltage-in-to-frequency-out and multiple waveforms in classical 1-volt-per-octave synthesizer oscillators, Chowning-style FM synthesis uses a linear voltage-in-to-frequency-out relationship and sine-wave oscillators. [...] The resulting complex waveform may have many component frequencies, and there is no requirement that they all bear a harmonic relationship. [...] Sophisticated FM synths such as the Yamaha DX7 series can have 6 operators per voice; some synths with FM can also often use filters and variable amplifier types to alter the signal's characteristics into a sonic voice that either roughly imitates acoustic instruments or creates sounds that are unique. FM synthesis is especially valuable for metallic or clangorous noises such as bells, cymbals, or other percussion.|$|E

To test these types of communication systems, users will often create their own custom waveforms and download them into the vector signal generator to create the desired test signal.|$|E
