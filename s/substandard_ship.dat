40|$|The Maritime Labour Convention {{amendments}} concerning {{abandonment of}} seafarers {{are expected to}} come into force in 2017, something long sought by seafarers’ representatives. The Convention is already considered a success, being {{referred to as a}} ‘super convention’ or ‘seafarers’ bill of rights’, and the amendments are expected to receive a similar reception. Although it is an international legal instrument, the Maritime Labour Convention also establishes, for contracting states, soft guidelines on how its provisions should be implemented. The Convention recognises that the seafarer is a transnational worker in that different states are entitled to adopt varying approaches to achieving the objectives of the law where the seafarer is concerned. It is argued in this thesis that seafarers are transnational workers, hence that ‘abandonment of seafarers’ is a transnational phenomenon. That in turn means that the concept should not be confined merely to current international legal definitions. From a legal point of view, abandonment is a contractual breach committed by the employer. From a moral point of view, it is the employer severing their responsibility for their employees. Although this analysis is made largely through an English law lens, legislations of different countries are also studied. The evaluation undertaken in this study proves that there is in reality only a nominal differences between the legal rules of these countries in this area. The thesis will also assert that third parties in the employer-worker relationship, the so-called ‘private actors’, also have responsibilities in preventing abandonment from occurring, or in providing assistance when abandonment does happen. These private actors are essentially those persons involved in the maritime trade network – including those having responsibility for safety, such as flag states, port states, classification societies and P&I Clubs. In this regard, it is also stressed in this thesis that <b>substandard</b> <b>shipping</b> is directly connected to abandonment of seafarers; indeed, the Maritime Labour Convention should thus be seen as an important tool to help combat <b>substandard</b> <b>shipping...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. It is {{well know}} that in the Mediterranean and Black Sea area {{there are a lot of}} {{substandard}} small vessels and operators and despite the implementation of ISM and new STCW Convention these vessels are still obtaining employment. Most of these vessels are bought from second hand market, are classed with non IACS classification societies and in this way they are able to postpone forever serious repairs and maintenance work, they are operated without hull and sometimes P&I insurance being a real threat to the environment and innocent charterers. Due to their low operating expenses these vessels are able to offer very low freight rates which are sometimes not able to cover even financial expenses of a new vessel. This paper will try to assess what are the measures Black Sea Port Authorities have to take in order to force <b>substandard</b> <b>ships</b> and operators either to apply international recognised standards or to avoid calling at Black Sea ports...|$|R

40|$|Port {{state control}} is {{the control of}} foreign flagged ships in {{national}} ports by Port State Control Officers (PSCO). It is frequently asserted that port state control would be unnecessary in an ideal world. This assertion, however, does not reflect reality, {{and in many cases}} people are forced by the authorities to act within the law. A similar principle applies to the shipping world as well. In many cases, shipowners and ship managers are forced to act within the law. Because control systems used by other players in the shipping world have been unable to eradicate all substandard vessels from the seas, port state control systems have become more effective and have provided a safety net of last resort. Port state control is not, and can never be, a substitute for the proper exercise of flag state responsibility. Flag states have the primary responsibility of safeguarding against <b>substandard</b> <b>ships.</b> When flag states fail to meet their commitments, port states must act as the last safety net in the control system...|$|R
40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] The {{possibility}} that North Korean ships may be smuggling {{weapons of mass destruction}} is a matter of intense concern in the Asia Pacific region and beyond. The few reported incidents of North Korean ships involved in WMD transport are ambiguous; some ships have been engaged in legal weapons trade and some carried "dual-use" goods suitable for use in nonmilitary applications, like agriculture. Ownership of the North Korean merchant fleet is largely private and highly fragmented; most of its ships are small, old, and in poor repair, and are often subject to rigorous scrutiny in foreign ports. The inability of the government to effectively regulate the low-cost, <b>substandard</b> <b>shipping</b> industry creates the risk and incentives to smuggle goods, including WMD.

40|$|The {{succession}} of maritime accidents {{in the last}} decades of the 20 th Century caused a strong political and public outcry for more stringent maritime safety regulations and measures. One {{of the most significant}} developments in this regard was the establishment of several regional agreements on Port State Control (PSC) with the specific objective of fighting <b>substandard</b> <b>shipping</b> through coordinated and harmonised inspection procedures. This article is based on results from 32, 206 PSC inspections carried out by the European Union and European Free Trade Association Member States within the Paris MoU region from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015 to assess whether discrepancies among Member States exist after the entry into force of Directive 2009 / 16 /EC and the introduction of the New Inspection Regime. Further, the study proceeds by investigating whether PSC team composition and inspector’s background influence inspection outcomes. The study has identified that differences in detecting at least one deficiency and/or detaining a vessel are significant among Member States. With regard to team composition and background, it appears that the former correlates to the number of deficiencies and detentions and the latter, though the significance is not always consistent, to detecting a certain type of deficiencies according to the specific inspector’s backgrounds...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{shipping}} industry’s international legal framework {{and the existence}} of loopholes in the system, an estimated 5 - 10 percent of <b>substandard</b> <b>ships</b> exist which {{are more likely to have}} incidents with high economic cost. This article uses ship life cycles to provide insight into the effectiveness of inspections on prolonging ship lives. We account for fluctuations in the relevant economic environment and the (possible time-varying) ship particulars. We use a unique dataset containing information on the timing of accidents, inspections, ship particular changes of more than fifty thousand ships over a 29 year time period (1978 - 2007). The results of our duration analysis reveal that {{the shipping}} industry is a relative safe industry but there is a possible over-inspection of vessels. It also reveals the need to improve transparency related to class withdrawals and changes of classification of the vessel. Another interesting finding is that for the majority of ship types an increase in earnings decreases the incident rate. This is in contrast to the industry perception of the impact of earnings. The effect of inspections vary across ship types and the prevention of incidents with high economic costs can be improved by better coordination of inspections, data sharing and a decrease in the number of inspections. Further, more emphasis should be placed on the rectification and follow up of deficiencies...|$|R

40|$|An {{insurance}} contract is one under which, for some considerations, the policyholder secures to himself some benefit upon {{the occurrence of}} an uncertain event beyond his own control and adverse to his interests by transferring {{some or all of}} the risk to the insurers. Thus according to the general principle of insurance: insurance is a commodity to protect against casualties and against unforeseeable losses. An issue arises where an unfit vessel is unable to encounter ordinary perils while at sea, and where such unfitness could have been avoided had the shipowner excised due diligence to make the vessel properly equipped, manned and maintained; the risk caused by the unfitness would be foreseeable and outside the scope of insurance in principle. Thus in marine {{insurance contract}}s, there are corresponding rules to prevent such certain risks.

40|$|This paper summarises the {{findings}} of a study on maritime safety in the Asia Pacific region. The study was conducted in 1999 by the Asia Pacific Maritime Institute for the APEC Transportation Working Group. The study aimed to identify specific mechanisms used by APEC governments and maritime industries to promote safer <b>shipping</b> and combat <b>substandard</b> <b>shipping</b> in the Asia Pacific region. Information was collected through a survey and interviews. The survey was posted on the internet and also sent by fax and post. The interviews covered 14 APEC economies: Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States. A total of 424 people from various maritime sectors participated. Information was cross checked against published literature and relevant documentation. Maritime experts in the region were also consulted. Seven mechanisms were found to be the most effective in improving the safety of shipping in the Asia Pacific region: port state control; ship vetting; ISM Code implementation; industry self regulation; government-industry partnerships; a regional approach and a stronger Asia Pacific voice; and media coverage and information exchange. To make these mechanisms truly effective, however, a range of implementation problems would need to be resolved. Further, two other issues need greater regional attention: better economic incentives to reward compliance and improving crew training, competence, and welfare.

40|$|This paper applies Hofstede’s {{cultural}} dimensions {{into the}} shipping industry and analyzes the culture effects on vessel detention. All ships {{have their own}} nationality but the flag control is manageably sophisticated. <b>Substandard</b> <b>ships</b> are aware of high risks, and quality control of ships {{is critical to the}} maritime safety and security. It has been proved that the detention rate depends on the flag of registry together with ship age, inspecting authority, type of ship, and recognized organization influencing. Previous research has focused on the performance of individual flag of registry in terms of casualty and detention rate. This study considers the collective characteristics of flags according to culture effects and their influences on ship quality. Based on Hofstede’s five‐dimension culture theory, we map the flag states on culture dimensions. From 12, 635 detention records of the Tokyo MOU region from 2000 to 2009, we determine the effect of culture dimensions against the vessel detention. The findings can be summarised in two aspects. First, the power distance index has little influences on the detention rate. Second, more importantly, the individualism, uncertainty avoidance index and long‐term orientation have positively impacts on the number of detentions. Our findings show that culture indeed has an effect on the vessel detention taken by different Port State Controls. A further look on the flag of registry is that the performance of individual flags may be better illustrated if individual flags are classified according to culture dimensions. This paper is organised as follows: Section 1 introduces the background; Section 2 discusses related literature; Section 3 considers the data collection and methodology; Section 4 concerns the findings; and Section 5 addresses conclusions and further research.

40|$|The primary {{characterization}} {{of the relationship of}} ports both international and domestic is that of competition. Ports vigorously compete in terms of costs and services for international shipping business whether that business be container vessels, bulk carriers or cruise ships. The great ports of the world, for example, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Rotterdam, have competitive advantages compared with lesser ports because of geography and history. Nevertheless, these great ports, like others, are alert to competition and the need to acquire and retain vessel traffic. Until recently, ports were inclined to treat vessel safety and vessel environmental standards in the same competitive mode. In most of the world, competition between ports of different countries operated to ensure that a country did not adopt port laws unfavorable to vessel traffic. Strict environmental requirements and safety standards applied to visiting vessels could increase the cost of transportation and make a port less competitive. Moreover, the shipping industry argued that host states applying differing local standards would create a checker-board of regulations that would increase compliance costs unreasonably and inhibit ocean trade. While certain states, such as the United States, because of its unique geographical, economic and political situation, could unilaterally apply strict port laws, other countries feared that adoption of strict port laws would have the significant economic repercussions suggested by the shipping industry. However, the increasing concern about sub-standard vessels plying the oceans of the world-by the public, as a result of publicity surrounding oil tanker disasters such as the Exxon Valdez; by the shipping industry, because of their poor public image; and by governments, in response to the public and industry-created a demand for a cooperative or regional approach to encourage port states to enhance enforcement of marine pollution and vessel safety laws against visiting vessels. This demand has been responded to with the adoption of regional arrangements for port state control. The first regional arrangement for port states was created in Europe through the 1982 Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control in Implementing Agreements on Maritime Safety and Protection of the Marine Environment, known as the Paris Port State Control MOU. This was followed by the 1992 Latin American Agreement on Port State Control, then came the 1993 Tokyo Port State Control MOU, the 1996 Caribbean Port State Control MOU, and the 1997 MOU on Port State Control in the Mediterranean Region. Most recently, there is the Port State Control MOU for the Indian Ocean and East Africa and the West and Central African MOU. Preparations are being made for a port state control MOU for the Persian Gulf. All the regional port state control arrangements are substantively similar and follow the model of the 1982 Paris Port State Control MOU. For example, all the port state control MOUs contain wording in the preamble which indicates the need for a regional approach 2 ̆ 2 to prevent the operation of <b>substandard</b> <b>ships</b> 2 ̆ 2 in order 2 ̆ 2 to avoid distorting competition between ports. 2 ̆ 2 All the regional port state control MOUs encourage the appropriate national port authorities to inspect visiting vessels to ensure that those vessels have been constructed, are equipped, crewed and operated in compliance with the standards set by the relevant international treaties. 2 ̆ 2 Where vessels are detected as not being in compliance with the standard setting conventions, the host state may prevent the offending vessel from leaving until the defects have been remedied. The hope is that as more countries and regions adopt port state control, enforcement of international vessel standards will be enhanced and vessel-owners will undertake to comply with the standards voluntarily rather than risk detection of substandard vessels and face potential delays and penalties. The wide-scale adoption of port state control is an attempt to develop an exception to the competitive relationship of ports within the same region. Port state control has as its foundation and operational ethic cooperation amongst regional ports. That cooperation has as its goals safer ships and cleaner seas, and is built upon the view that the goals can only be accomplished if all the regional ports apply and enforce the same rules in a similar manner to visiting vessels. Where the ports cooperate by agreeing to apply the same rules in a similar manner, then no single port seeks or acquires competitive advantage by offering to overlook sub-standard vessels. The focus of this contribution is upon three international law questions that arise regarding port state control: 1) What is the international legal foundation of port state control?; 2) What are the international treaties that regional port state control authorities apply to visiting vessels and does international law place any limits on the law that a port state can apply to a visiting vessel?; and 3) What are the international legal principles applicable to a port state respecting the controlling of vessel access to or the departure from ports...|$|R
