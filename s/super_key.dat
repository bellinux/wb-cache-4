40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to analyze the single-dose oral toxicity of the <b>super</b> <b>key</b> (processed sulfur). Methods: All experiments were conducted at Medvill, an institution authorized to perform non-clinical studies, under the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. In order to investigate the oral toxicity of <b>super</b> <b>key</b> We administered it orally to Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The SD rats were divided into four groups of five male and five female animals per group: group 1 being the control group and groups 2, 3, and 4 being the experimental groups. Doses of <b>super</b> <b>key</b> 500 mg/kg, 1, 000 mg/kg and 2, 000 mg/kg were administered to the experimental groups, and a dose of normal saline solution, 10 mL/kg, was administered to the control group. We examined the survival rates, weights, clinical signs, gross findings and necropsy findings. This study was conducted under {{the approval of the}} Institutional Animal Ethics Committee. (Approval number: A 01 - 14018). Results: No deaths or abnormalities occurred in any of the four groups. Although slight decreases in the weights of some female rats were noted, no significant changes in weights or differences in the gross findings between the control group and the experimental groups were observed. To check for abnormalities in organs, we used microscopy to examine representative histological sections of each specified organ; the results showed no significant differences in any of the organs. Conclusion: The results of this research showed that administration of 500 ─ 2, 000 mg/kg of <b>super</b> <b>key</b> did not cause any changes in the weights or in the results of necropsy examinations. Neither did it result in any mortalities. The above findings suggest that treatment with <b>super</b> <b>key</b> is relatively safe.

40|$|Summary. Cultivars, {{candidate}} cultivars {{and lines}} were examined. They originated from different countries {{or they were}} products of the newest selection of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the Institute of Plants Genetic Resources, Sadovo. The present work presents results on some morphological and physiological indices-flag leaf location, continuation of vegetation period, and water exchange indices including water retention ability of excised flag leaves of the examined genotypes grown in field conditions. In the new wheat cultivars the yield potential and physiological characteristics connected with the adaptation mechanisms for drought resistance should be integrated to the highest degree. A germplasm of different origins {{is the basis for}} success of a breeding program in IPGR-Sadovo in order to create new cultivars wheat suitable for drought climatic conditions.

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{electron}} and muon {{components of}} extensive air shower (EAS) with energies above 1019 eV are analyzed via various giant EAS arrays. A varying property of showers is observed for two energy ranges; higher and lower than (3 − 4) × 1019 eV. The age parameter, zenith angle, shower size dependence on muon size and shower size dependence on primary energy show an increment of mass composition (MC) above (3 − 4) × 1019 eV. Comparison {{of the observed}} EAS results with the simulations of Capdevielle et al. (2000) and Shinozaki et al. (2005) gives at most 20 % photon fraction for primary energies above 1019 eV. The arrival directions of showers above 4 × 1019 eV indicate an increasing concentration towards the <b>super</b> galactic plane. <b>Key</b> words. cosmic rays 1...|$|R

Some <b>key</b> factors explored in this study include how frequently viewers used a second screen during the game, whether the second screen activity was related or unrelated to the game, and the consistency between a viewer's second screen uses and their motivations for watching the game.

40|$|Abstract. Arrow’s celebrated impossibility theorem {{states that}} a {{sufficiently}} diverse domain of voter preference profiles cannot be mapped into social {{orders of the}} alternatives without violating {{at least one of}} three appealing conditions. Following Fishburn and Kelly, we define a set of strict preference profiles to be super Arrovian if Arrow’s impossibility theorem holds for this set and each of its strict preference profile supersets. We write σ(m, n) for the size of the smallest super Arrovian set for m alternatives and n voters. We show that σ(m, 2) = ⌈ 2 m ⌉ and σ(3, 3) = 19. Wealso show m− 2 that σ(m, n) is bounded by a constant for fixed n and bounded on both sides by a constant times 2 n for fixed m. In particular, we find that limn→ ∞ σ(3,n) / 2 n = 3. Finally, we answer two questions posed by Fishburn and Kelly on the structure of minimum and minimal <b>super</b> Arrovian sets. <b>Key</b> words.
