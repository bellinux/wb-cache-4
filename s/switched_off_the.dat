5|$|In March 1945, Johnson patrolled as Operation Plunder and Operation Varsity pushed Allied armies into Germany. There {{was little}} {{sign of the}} Luftwaffe. Numerous ground-attack {{operations}} were carried out instead. On 26 March Johnson's wing was relocated to Twente and {{he was promoted to}} group captain. Days later Johnson took command of No. 125 Wing. On 5 April, after returning from patrol in Spitfire Mk XIV MV268, he <b>switched</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> engine just as a Bf 109 flew overhead. Seeing the Spitfire, it turned in for an attack; Johnson took cover under his fighter while the airfield defences shot down the 109. On 16 April 1945 Johnson's Wing moved to RAF Celle in Germany.|$|E
5|$|The 9/11 Commission {{estimated}} that the flight was hijacked between 08:51 and 08:54, shortly after American Airlines Flight 11 struck the World Trade Center and not too long after United Airlines Flight 175 had been hijacked. The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to air traffic control occurred at 08:50:51. Unlike the other three flights, there were no reports of anyone being stabbed or a bomb threat and the pilots were not immediately killed but shoved {{to the back of}} the plane with the rest of the passengers. At 08:54, the plane began to deviate from its normal, assigned flight path and turned south. Two minutes later at 08:56, the plane's transponder was <b>switched</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> hijackers set the flight's autopilot on a course heading east towards Washington, D.C.|$|E

25|$|On 1 June 2005 it was {{announced}} that an inquest into the crash would be held at the Guildhall in Windsor, Berkshire. The inquest was expected to last 12 days, starting on 17 October 2005. A delay ensued over whether {{the families of the victims}} should be granted legal aid. The inquest finally began in October 2007. A policeman who had witnessed the crash, PC Brazier, testified at the inquest. He told the jury that he believed the crash was caused by a suicide attempt. The Forensic Accident Investigator, David Price, told the inquest that he had been able to determine that the car had been parked on the level crossing with its engine <b>switched</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> handbrake fully applied, the vehicle's lights <b>switched</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> steering on a partial left-hand turn (which was not consistent with driving across the crossing), and that its fuel tank still contained at least 8 litres (about 2 gallons) of petrol.|$|E

25|$|In Germany, the StVZO (Road Traffic Licensing Regulations) {{calls for}} a {{different}} function also known as parking lamps: With the vehicle's ignition <b>switched</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> operator may activate a low-intensity light at the front (white) and rear (red) on either the left or {{the right side of}} the car. This function is used when parking in narrow unlit streets to provide parked-vehicle conspicuity to approaching drivers.

25|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{excessive}} pressure build-up in the hydraulic power network, a release valve was fitted beside the main hall of the powerhouse. A tall water fountain, the Jet d'Eau, was ejected by the device whenever it was activated. This happened typically at end of work when the factories <b>switched</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> machines one at the time, so that the pressure in the system was hard to control and the supply of pressurized water was difficult {{to adapt to the}} real demand. The tall fountain was visible from a long distance and became the landmark of the city. In 1891 it was moved to the current location in the lake where it is operated {{for the sole purpose of}} a tourist attraction without any other function.|$|E
25|$|According to the strikers, it {{all began}} because {{of the price of}} pork chop dinner in the factory's canteen. On July 8, one worker noticed that {{overnight}} it had been increased by 80% - from 10.20 zlotys, to 18.10 zlotys. The workers, who for a long time had been complaining about prices and quality of food, decided that they had had enough. Following the inspiration of Miroslaw Kaczan who <b>switched</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> machines, Section W-340 was first, but after a few hours, the whole factory stopped working. On the same days, following Świdnik's example, workers of Lublin's branch of the state Polmozbyt auto parts and repairs service joined the strike. A Stoppage Committee was created in Świdnik, headed by Zofia Bartkiewicz, which demanded economic concessions. The workers did not use the irritating word strike on purpose.|$|E

25|$|Duel Live {{made use}} of the {{original}} outdoor queue line, often with other actors roaming the wooded area. For the 2008 version, the queue featured gravediggers and werewolves creeping up on the guests, though in 2009 this was reduced to one actor in a hooded robe. Guests waited at the door instead of walking straight in, before being greeted by either a maid or a butler (the performers alternated during the 2009 version, but in 2008 only the butler featured) and given a brief talk about what was inside and why the guns were <b>switched</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> TV screens in the Drawing Room were covered with cloth and muted, and the original spooky music turned up; the room being similar {{to what it was}} in the original Haunted House.

25|$|A {{total of}} 96 people {{died as a}} result of the disaster. On the day 94 people, aged from 10 to 67 years old, {{died as a result}} of their injuries, either at the stadium, in the ambulances, or shortly after arrival at hospital. A total of 766 people were {{reported}} to have suffered injuries, although less than half required hospital treatment. The less seriously injured survivors who did not live in the Sheffield area were advised to seek treatment for their injuries at hospitals nearer to their homes. On 19 April, the death toll reached 95 when 14-year-old Lee Nicol died in hospital after his life support machine was <b>switched</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> death toll reached 96 in March 1993, when artificial feeding and hydration were withdrawn from 22-year-old Tony Bland after nearly four years, during which time he had remained in a persistent vegetative state showing no sign of improvement. This followed a legal challenge in the High Court by his family to have his treatment withdrawn, a landmark challenge which succeeded in November 1992.|$|E
500|$|George Orwell {{believed}} {{just the}} opposite. He argued: [...] "It {{is clear that}} something has departed, some kind of current has been <b>switched</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> later verse does not contain the earlier, {{even if it is}} claimed as an improvement upon it [...] He does not really feel his faith, but merely assents to it for complex reasons. It does not in itself give him any fresh literary impulse." [...] Years later, Russell Kirk wrote, [...] "I cannot agree with Orwell that Eliot gave no more than a melancholy assent to doctrines now quite unbelievable. Over the past quarter of a century, most serious critics—whether or not they find Christian faith impossible—have found in the Quartets the greatest twentieth-century achievements in the poetry of philosophy and religion." [...] Like Orwell, Stead also noticed a difference between the Four Quartets and Eliot's earlier poetry, but he disagreed with Orwell's conclusion: [...] "Four Quartets is an attempt to bring into a more exact balance the will and the creative imagination; it attempts to harness the creative imagination which in all Eliot's earlier poetry ran its own course, edited but not consciously directed. The achievement is of a high order, but the best qualities of Four Quartets are inevitably different from those of The Waste Land.|$|E

500|$|The main {{differences}} between the Volt and the Ampera are in their styling. The Ampera has a distinctive front and rear fascia, with a large cut-out in the rear bumper. The Opel Ampera features more stylized alloy wheels as standard, and the side skirts are body-colored rather than black. In the inside there are only minor differences and both versions share the same exact powertrain and battery pack. A key operational difference was that the Ampera has four drive modes, one more than the 2011/12 model year Volt. The additional option is [...] "City Mode", which adapts battery management {{to the needs of}} commuter travel.

500|$|Returning to Australia in November 1949, Evans {{was posted}} to Central Flying School (CFS) at RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria, where he {{qualified}} as a flying instructor. He served in this capacity {{for the next}} four years, including an exchange posting with the Royal New Zealand Air Force from May 1951 to July 1953. As he was preparing to depart New Zealand, he received word that his next posting would be to the Korean War as a pilot with No.77 Squadron; the armistice prevented this and he returned to No.38 Squadron as an instructor. In 1954 he was assigned to transporting VIPs, serving with the Governor-General's Flight (later No.34 (Special Transport) Squadron} until 1956. As well as Governor-General Sir William Slim and Lady Slim, his passengers included Prime Minister Robert Menzies and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Promoted to squadron leader, Evans' service with the VIP flight earned him the Air Force Cross in the Queen's Birthday Honours promulgated in the London Gazette on 13June 1957. The same year, he attended RAAF Staff College at Point Cook, Victoria. He became personal staff officer to the Minister for Air in 1958, a position he found valuable for the insight he gained into Australia's political culture. In November 1959, he took a refresher course at CFS, qualifying on De Havilland Vampire and English Electric Canberra jets. He underwent further training on Canberra bombers with No.1 Operational Conversion Unit at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, graduating in May 1960. From then until 1962 he served as a flight commander in No.2 Squadron, operating Canberras out of RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia. He subsequently attended the RAF College of Air Warfare. In January 1963, Evans was transferred to Air Staff Division, Canberra, where he helped formulate operational requirements for a new RAAF bomber. His final specification included a payload of , speed of Mach2, and range of [...] This requirement was met by the General Dynamics F-111C, 24 of which were ordered by the Australian government in October 1963. As an interim measure until delivery of the F-111, the US government offered 24 Boeing B-47 Stratojets to the RAAF. Though the offer was never seriously considered, a B-47 was test flown from Amberley to Darwin in November 1963 by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Val Hancock, with Evans as passenger. Evans had been assigned to fly the plane but was replaced at the last moment by Hancock; the take-off almost ended in disaster after Hancock unknowingly <b>switched</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> engines' water injection—needed to ensure sufficient thrust in hot conditions—that Evans had switched on before vacating the pilot's seat. In January 1965, Evans was posted to Washington, DC, as Assistant Air Attaché, having [...] "had quite enough of writing Air Staff Requirements".|$|E
