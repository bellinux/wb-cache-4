Regulators and nuclear operators went to painstaking lengths to ignore safety risks at the plant or cover them up.

[...] The NAIIC blamed lax safety measures on what it called the country’s powerful and “collusive” decision-makers and on a conformist culture that allowed them to operate with little scrutiny. “What must be admitted — very painfully — is that this was a disaster ‘Made in Japan,’” investigation chairman Kiyoshi Kurokawa wrote in the introduction to the report. “Its fundamental causes {{are to be found in}} the ingrained conventions of Japanese culture: our reflexive obedience; our reluctance to question authority; our devotion to ‘sticking with the program’; our groupism; and our insularity.” ...|$|E

40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{purpose of}} nuclear power plant safety systems is to prevent damage to the reactor and the possible release of radioactive materials into the surroundings following an internal or external event that interrupts normal power plant operation. Different design principles have been developed and they are incorporated to the safety design {{to ensure the safety}} functions are performed even if some components or whole systems fail to function as intended. Many nuclear power plant safety systems rely on electrical power to operate. Following a loss of off-site power accident, the power plant electrical systems are supplied by the emergency power sources. <b>Station</b> <b>blackout</b> generators constitute an alternative source for AC power designed for situations where all the main emergency diesel generators a fail to function in accident conditions. To introduce diversity into the emergency power sources, gas turbine generator units are proposed to be used instead of diesel generators as <b>station</b> <b>blackout</b> power sources. Current nuclear regulations regarding the emergency power generating facilities in a nuclear power plants only consider diesel engines for the application. The motivation for this research is the absence of a national or a global standard for the design and acceptance testing of gas turbines in this application. In this thesis the main goal is to determine the requirements for a <b>station</b> <b>blackout</b> gas turbine generator so that it fulfils its role in the overall nuclear power plant safety system design.

On average, transients-with loss of injection, <b>station</b> <b>blackout</b> sequences, and transients with loss of decay heat removal are important contributors for the BWR 3 / 4 plants, while transients, <b>station</b> <b>blackout</b> sequences, and loss-of-coolant accidents are important for the Westinghouse 4 -loop plants.

40|$|The {{safety of}} Generations II and III {{nuclear power plants}} relies on the {{availability}} of AC power, which is required for decay heat removal. This AC power (designated offsite power) is provided by sources outside the power plant via a grid that is susceptible to both random and induced failures. When offsite power is lost, alternative emergency sources on-site are started to drive the plant's safety systems. If, however, a situation arises where these sources are also unavailable or unable to provide the required power for the entire period the offsite sources are unavailable, a complete loss of power to the safety buses ensues. This phenomenon is known as <b>Station</b> <b>Blackout</b> (SBO), and its severity depends on its duration as well as, the plant's initial status. Consequently, the time-dependent non-recovery probability of AC power is a key parameter in the risk assessment and management of nuclear power plants. In this work, an easy-to-use and generally applicable reliability framework is proposed to model power recovery in <b>station</b> <b>blackout</b> sequences. It employs a load flow technique integrated into an efficient event-driven Monte-Carlo simulation algorithm. The resulting framework quantifies the probability of power recovery as a function of both time and power level, including other relevant indices. It, therefore, serves the purpose of a rational decision support tool in the mitigation of <b>station</b> <b>blackout</b> accidents.

40|$|This thesis {{involves}} exploring {{enhancement of}} estimating {{the probability of}} a critical <b>station</b> <b>blackout</b> in nuclear power plant operations by the use of direct numerical evaluation of multidimensional nonrecovery integrals. This requires development of computational methods with data provided from South Texas Project Nuclear Operating Company (STPNOC). Several methods that are currently used in the industry to estimate such probabilities often overestimate the value substantially. The computational integral method developed in the thesis will reduce excess conservatism while maintaining plant safety standards. This computational integral is calculated using a MATLAB research code referred to generally as "STP-TAMIL" which is for South Texas Project [...] Texas A&M Improved LOOP. The code itself (along with the user manual) was developed in conjunction with this Thesis. STP-TAMIL is successful in reducing the estimated probability of critical <b>station</b> <b>blackout</b> by a significant amount (about 88. 47 percent) with the incorporation of recovery of offsite and onsite power for South Texas Project? s nuclear plants, and results were verified.

Some assumptions used throughout the problem suggest that if more dynamic rates or distributions are used then more recovery can be obtained, which will decrease the probability of critical <b>station</b> <b>blackout.</b> Methodology developed in this thesis will be used in future work to develop this STP-TAMIL research code into a model used industry wide in commercial nuclear power plants...|$|E
