The small z-height values indicated a very uniform z-height distribution of both RE-NPs for small 1 [*]×[*] 1  μm 2 <b>scan</b> <b>areas.</b> On the contrary for both RE-NPs and larger <b>scan</b> <b>areas,</b> the z-height distribution was significantly broader. The low z-height distribution values at small <b>scan</b> <b>areas</b> reflect {{the presence of}} small-sized RE-NPs in the liquid suspensions. The surface parameters values in DMEM+FBS medium were on the average larger than in ethanol, showing a complex reactive state between proteins and RE-NPs, {{in agreement with the}} multifaceted structuring of Fig. 5 and the 2 D-FFT data (Fig. 6). Overall, LaF 3 NPs exhibited an intriguing response in dried suspensions and more extensive surface roughness parameters than PrF 3 NPs.|$|R

50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of AFM {{compared with the}} scanning electron microscope (SEM) is the single scan image size. In one pass, the SEM can image an area {{on the order of}} square millimeters with a depth of field on the order of millimeters, whereas the AFM can only image a maximum <b>scanning</b> <b>area</b> of about 150×150 micrometers and a maximum height on the order of 10-20 micrometers. One method of improving the scanned area size for AFM is by using parallel probes in a fashion similar to that of millipede data storage.|$|E
30|$|To {{understand}} {{the mechanism of}} the low-destructive friction-induced nanofabrication, the microscopic structure of the <b>scanned</b> <b>area</b> of the quartz sample was detected by cross-sectional TEM (XTEM, JEOL JEM- 2100 LaB 6, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) before and after KOH etching. The XTEM samples were prepared using a Quanta 3 D FEG focused ion beam (FIB, FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA) miller from the <b>scanned</b> <b>area</b> on quartz. In order to facilitate the FIB cutting across the <b>scanned</b> <b>area,</b> linescratch areas in the length of 200 μm were produced on the quartz samples by a nanoscratch tester (CSM Instruments, Peseux, Switzerland) with a spheral diamond tip having a radius of 20 μm. The low-destructive area was scratched under the normal load of 45 mN (the corresponding Hertzian contact pressure is 4.9 GPa), and the groove in a depth of 23 nm was scratched under the normal load of 95 mN.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn image-tracking {{procedure}} for {{atomic force microscopy}} is proposed and tested, which allows repeated imaging of the same area without suffering from lateral drift. The drift correction procedure is based on on-line cross-correlation of succeeding images. Using the image-tracking procedure allows zooming in on a small <b>scan</b> <b>area</b> {{over a long period}} and thus increases the frame rate inversely proportional to the <b>scan</b> <b>area.</b> Application of the procedure is demonstrated for diffusion of 5. 4 -kb DNA plasmids. With a <b>scan</b> <b>area</b> of 500500 nm 2, a single plasmid can be imaged for more than 30 min at 4 s per frame, with a drift less than 10 nm. The high temporal resolution allows detailed analysis of the diffusion of DNA molecules. A diffusion coefficient of 30 nm 2 /s is found for most DNA molecules, though many molecules are tempsorally pinned to the mica surface, restricting diffusion...|$|R
30|$|In brief, {{the contact}} {{pressure}} {{played a significant}} role in the low-destructive friction-induced nanofabrication. With the increase of contact pressure, the fabrication depth increased from 0 to 2.9 nm before the yield of quartz surface. Since the superficial layer of the <b>scanned</b> <b>area</b> can be etched selectively, it was reasonable to speculate that such layer may reveal a unique etching behaviour and microstructure. To understand the fabrication mechanism of the proposed method, it is essential to analyse the reaction kinetics of selective etching and detect the microstructures of the <b>scanned</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R

5000|$|One {{problem with}} this {{approach}} is that radar signals often change in amplitude for reasons {{that have nothing to do}} with beam position. Over the period of a few tenths of seconds, for instance, changes in target heading, rain clouds and other issues can dramatically affect the returned signal. Since conical scanning systems depend on the signal growing or weakening due only to the position of the target relative to the beam, such changes in reflected signal can cause it to be [...] "confused" [...] about the position of the target within the beam's <b>scanning</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

The Smart Laser Scanner is a marker-less finger tracking system using a modified laser scanner/projector developed at the University of Tokyo in 2003-2004. It is capable of acquiring three-dimensional coordinates in real time without the need of any image processing at all (essentially, it is a rangefinder scanner that instead of continuously scanning over the full field of view, restricts its <b>scanning</b> <b>area</b> to a very narrow window precisely {{the size of the}} target). Gesture recognition has been demonstrated with this system. The sampling rate can be very high (500 Hz), enabling smooth trajectories to be acquired without the need of filtering (such as Kalman).|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Fault {{tolerance}} {{is critical}} in many of today’s large computer systems. This paper focuses on improving fault tolerance through testing. Moreover, it concentrates on the memory faults: how to access the editable part of a process memory space and how this part is affected. A special Software Fault Injection Technique (SFIT) is proposed for this purpose. This is done by sequentially scanning {{the memory of the}} target process, and trying to edit maximum number of bytes inside that memory. The technique was implemented and tested on a group of programs in software packages such as jet-audio, Notepad, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft Outlook. The results from the test sample process indicate that the size of the <b>scanned</b> <b>area</b> depends on several factors. These factors are: process size, process type, and virtual memory size of the machine under test. The results show that increasing the process size will increase the scanned memory space. They also show that inputoutput processes have more <b>scanned</b> <b>area</b> size than other processes. Increasing the virtual memory size will also affect the size of the <b>scanned</b> <b>area</b> but to a certain limit...|$|R

30|$|From Figure  2 b, it {{was noted}} that the {{fabrication}} depth increased with the increase of the scanning load or the contact pressure on the wearless <b>scanned</b> <b>area.</b> To analyse the effect of contact pressure on nanofabrication in a more detailed manner, a scratch consisting of a wearless area and groove was performed on the quartz surface under progressive loads from 0 to 40 μN by AFM. As shown in Figure  4, the cross-sectional profile of the <b>scanned</b> <b>area</b> (dashed line) revealed that the surface was wearless below Fn = 15 μN, where the corresponding contact pressure Pc was below 5.1 GPa. With the further increase of the normal load from 15 to 40 μN, the groove was formed on the surface and the wear depth increased from 0 to 1.7 nm (dashed line). After etching for 6 h at 293 K, the etched thickness increased from 0 to 2.9 nm on the wearless <b>scanned</b> <b>area</b> and then tended to stabilise on the groove. Therefore, the upper limit of the contact pressure for low-destructive scanning was 5.1 GPa, and the critical fabrication depth was 2.9 nm after single low-destructive scanning and post-etching.
