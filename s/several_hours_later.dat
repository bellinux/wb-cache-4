5|$|A second {{hurricane}} {{was spotted}} in the Straits of Florida at tropical storm intensity on September10. <b>Several</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> the system made landfall in Marquesas Keys, Florida. Early on September11, it strengthened into a hurricane. Intensifying slightly further, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) shortly thereafter. The hurricane maintained this intensity while moving west-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico and struck extreme southwestern Cameron Parish, Louisiana early on September13. Shortly thereafter, it weakened to {{a tropical storm}} over Texas, before dissipating <b>several</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later.</b>|$|E
5|$|Second Lieutenant Ndo Edou gave {{instructions}} to transfer M'ba to Ndjolé, Aubame's electoral stronghold. However, due to heavy rain, the deposed {{president and his}} captors took shelter in an unknown village.

5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance left Central America on September 22. Despite some wind shear, the system gradually became better organized and a tropical depression formed September 26, being upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} <b>several</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later.</b> The cyclone immediately moved north. Instead of strengthening into a hurricane before landfall as forecasted, Olaf weakened due to its proximity to land. On September 29, Olaf made landfall near Salina Cruz, Oaxaca.|$|E

5|$|Following the system's designation, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for the southwestern coastline of Mexico stretching from Acapulco to La Fortuna. By 0300UTC on July5, the watch was extended from Acapulco to Manzanillo, while {{a tropical}} storm warning was issued from Lázaro Cárdenas to Manzanillo. <b>Several</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> the watch was discontinued for the coastline stretching from Acapulco to Lázaro Cárdenas and issued from La Fortuna to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. Meanwhile, the warning from Lázaro Cárdenas to Manzanillo was discontinued, with a new warning issued from Zihuatanejo to La Fortuna. All tropical storm watches in effect were discontinued by 0300UTC the following morning, with the warning being extended from Zihuatanejo to Cabo Corrientes. After being upgraded to a hurricane, Erick prompted the issuance of hurricane watches stretching from Punta San Telmo to Cabo Corrientes. At 1500UTC on July6, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued from Santa Fe to La Paz, though this was upgraded to a warning <b>several</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later.</b> Following many other revisions, all tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued after Erick degenerated into a remnant low early on July9.|$|E

5|$|The NHC issued several {{watches and}} {{warnings}} for {{portions of the}} Mexican coastline; {{the first was a}} tropical storm watch for areas between Zihuatanejo and Manzanillo on June22. <b>Several</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> a portion of the watch was upgraded to a warning as Andres neared the coastline. By 1500UTC, a hurricane watch was declared for areas between Lazaro Cardenas and Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco and the tropical storm watch for Zihuatanejo to Lazaro Cardenas was discontinued. Roughly six hours later, a hurricane warning was raised for Punto San Telmo to Cabo Corrientes and the tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were extended northward to Punto San Telmo. By the following afternoon, the hurricane watch was discontinued and <b>several</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> areas under a tropical storm warning followed suit. Early on June24, all watches and warnings associated with Andres were discontinued as it rapidly dissipated offshore. Authorities closed ports in Lázaro Cárdenas, Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta because of rough seas. Schools throughout Colima were closed prior to the storm and Mexican officials raised the awareness level to orange.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} watches and warning issued during {{the passage of}} Hurricane Abby {{throughout}} the Caribbean. Some gale warnings were issued from the Grenadines to Guadeloupe starting on July 10. Around 1600 UTC later that day, a hurricane watch was issued for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. <b>Several</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> the watch was extended to include Dominican Republic and Haiti. All warnings were discontinued later, after the storm passed by.|$|E
5|$|A {{few hours}} after the JTWC began issuing advisories, the {{depression}} made landfall in Dilasag, Philippines. The next day, after crossing into the South China Sea, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm and named Prapiroon. <b>Several</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> PAGASA issued their final advisory on the storm as it moved out of their area of responsibility. By the morning of August2, Prapiroon intensified into a typhoon and reached its peak intensity with winds of 120km/h (75mph 10-min). The typhoon maintained this intensity until shortly before landfall near Shangyang, China at 12:00UTC on August3, where it weakened to a severe tropical storm. Prapiroon quickly weakened and dissipated early on August5.|$|E
50|$|On May 26, 2006, Saxton {{reported}} {{hearing a}} loud gunfire-type {{noise in the}} Rayburn House Office Building {{that led to the}} building being shut down for <b>several</b> <b>hours.</b> It was <b>later</b> determined that the noise was a construction worker discharging a pneumatic hammer in an elevator shaft near the garage.

5|$|After {{maintaining}} its intensity for 24 hours, Rachel made landfall at peak intensity near {{the southern tip}} of Baja California Sur. Strong wind shear prevented additional intensification, despite moving into the warm waters of the Gulf of California. After weakening slightly, Rachel made a second landfall midway between Las Mochis and Culiacán. Upon moving inland, the system rapidly weakened as the forward speed increased. Rachel dissipated <b>several</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later</b> on October3. By that time, the winds had decreased to 30mph (45km/h). The remnants of Rachel entered the United States, and were last noted over Texas.|$|E
5|$|Around 1200UTC the {{following}} day, Linfa further intensified into a severe tropical storm. A microwave satellite {{image of the}} storm depicted an eye-feature surrounded by deep convection. Interacting with a nearby upper-level low, poleward outflow significantly improved late on June19, fueling further strengthening. Slowly tracking in a general northward direction, Linfa continued to organize and by June20, the JTWC upgraded Linfa to a typhoon. A small, ragged eye appeared on visible satellite images by this time and <b>several</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> the storm reached its peak intensity just below typhoon-status according to the JMA. Maximum sustained winds peaked at 110km/h (70mph 10-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 975hPa (mbar).|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} morning hours of August4, the NHC {{upgraded}} Tropical Depression Eight-E to Tropical Storm Felicia, the seventh named storm of the season. Located within an area of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, averaging between 28 and 29°C (82 and 84°F), the storm quickly developed, with deep convection persisting around the center of circulation. These conditions were anticipated to persist for at least three days; however, there was an increased amount of uncertainty due to possible interaction with Tropical Storm Enrique. <b>Several</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> the storm began to undergo rapid intensification, following the formation of an eye. Around 2:00pm PDT (2100UTC), Felicia intensified into a hurricane.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} day, Abushagur held a {{press conference}} at the Rixos Conference Hotel where he accused the Zintani militia group as Barq Al-Nasr (Victory Lightening) as being behind his 9-hour kidnapping. Abushagur claimed that the ambulance he had been forced into took him to a barracks in the Swani area of Tripoli. He stated that his captors repeatedly asked him to reveal unspecified information. He claimed that he was also accused of {{being a member of the}} Muslim Brotherhood; an accusation which he denied. After being asked by his captors whether he supported General Haftar's Operation Dignity, Abushagur replied that he did not support any operations outside the state. He also claimed that his captors accused him of being wealthy and demanded 20 million Libyan dinars. After <b>several</b> <b>hours</b> of interrogation by his captors, he was escorted to a jail cell and remained there for <b>several</b> <b>hours.</b> Some time <b>later,</b> he was removed from the jail cell and a few <b>hours</b> <b>later</b> he was released.|$|R

5|$|During {{the morning}} of July 5, deep {{convection}} rapidly increased and banding features formed despite strong easterly wind shear. The convection persisted into the afternoon and the low was upgraded to Tropical Depression Five-E accordingly. Weak steering currents persisted as the depression moved towards the northwest at 4mph (6km/h) to 5mph (8km/h). Following the storm's upgrade, further development did not occur as the system tracked steadily towards the north-northwest. Early on July7, the depression made landfall near Lazaro Cardenas with winds of 35mph (55km/h). Rapid weakening followed shortly after landfall and the storm dissipated <b>several</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later</b> over the mountains of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Early on September9, Luis turned {{towards the}} north and {{weakened}} to a Category2 hurricane, with winds of 110mph (165km/h). <b>Several</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> the hurricane made its closest approach to Bermuda, passing about 200mi (320km) west of the island. Later that day, the storm began to accelerate as it traveled northeast ahead of a strong trough located to the northwest of Luis. During the afternoon of September10, Hurricane Luis began to undergo an extratropical transition as it rapidly approached the Canadian coastline. Due to the rapid movement of the storm, significant weakening did not occur until Luis was at an unusually high latitude.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Rick is the third-most intense Pacific {{hurricane}} on record. Developing {{south of}} Mexico on October15, 2009, Hurricane Rick traversed an area favoring rapid intensification, {{allowing it to}} become a hurricane within 24 hours of being declared a tropical depression. An eye began to form during the afternoon of October16; once fully formed, the storm underwent another period of rapid strengthening. During the afternoon of October17, the storm attained Category5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. <b>Several</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> Rick attained its peak intensity as the third-strongest Pacific hurricane on record with winds of 180mph (285km/h) and a barometric pressure of 906mbar (hPa; 26.75inHg).|$|E

5|$|Late on September26, shear {{began to}} relax and deep {{convection}} redeveloped around the center of circulation and the forward motion of the storm began to increase. <b>Several</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> the storm made a sudden northwest jump due to a passing shortwave trough. By this time, Kyle was just below hurricane-status, with sustained winds up to 70mph (110km/h). Continued organization led to the storm attaining hurricane intensity at 1200UTC on September27 while located about 345mi (555km) west of Bermuda. Upon attaining this intensity, the storm became embedded within an area strong, divergent, upper-level winds. Increasing in forward motion, the center of Kyle was located along the southwestern edge of the deep convection.|$|E
5|$|Later on June14, the JTWC {{issued a}} Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the depression. Deep {{convection}} consolidated around {{the center of}} circulation and convective banding features developed along {{the periphery of the}} system. <b>Several</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> the TCFA was canceled as the system rapidly degenerated, with convection mostly dissipating and an exposed low. Outflow significantly deteriorated as the system detached itself from the TUTT. By this time, the JMA had ceased advisories on the depression. Two days later, after tracking across Luzon, the system began to regenerate. Convection redeveloped around the low and outflow was reestablished to the south.|$|E
