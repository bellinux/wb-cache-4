Friedman began employment with the National Bureau of Economic Research during autumn 1937 to assist Simon Kuznets in his work on professional income. This work resulted in their jointly authored publication Incomes from Independent Professional Practice, which introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income, a major component of the Permanent Income Hypothesis that Friedman worked out in greater detail in the 1950s. The book hypothesizes that professional licensing artificially restricts the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> and raises prices.|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} to support agriculture–environmental policy {{decision}} making, stakeholders need ‘quantitative back-of-the-envelope’ analysis that is timely and sufficiently accurate {{to make informed}} decisions. We apply this concept to the analysis <b>of</b> the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> from agriculture. We present a spatially explicit production model and show {{how it can be}} used to derive the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> in a region. This model shows that the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> can be derived from the spatial distribution of opportunity cost <b>of</b> providing those <b>services.</b> We then show how this conceptual model can be used to develop a minimum-data (MD) approach to the analysis <b>of</b> the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> from agriculture that can be implemented with the kinds of secondary data that are available in most parts of the world. We apply the MD approach to simulate the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> carbon that could be sequestered in agricultural soils in the dryland grain-producing region of Montana. We find that the supply curve derived from the MD approach can approximate the supply curve obtained from a more elaborate model based on site-specific data, and can do so with sufficient accuracy for policy analysis. carbon sequestration, ecosystem services, minimum data, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
