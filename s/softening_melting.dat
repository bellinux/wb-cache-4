40|$|The thermal {{decomposition}} of fibre reinforced polymer composites in fire {{is a complex}} topic that involves the combined effects of thermal, chemical and physical processes. The thermal processes include heat conduction from the fire through the composite; heat generated or absorbed from the decomposition reactions of the polymer matrix, organic fibres and core material; heat generated by the ignition of flammable reaction gases; and convective heat loss from the egress of hot reaction gases and moisture vapours from the composite into the fire. The chemical processes include thermal <b>softening,</b> <b>melting,</b> pyrolysis and volatilisation of the polymer matrix, organic fibres and core material together with the formation, growth and oxidation of char. The physical processes can involve thermal expansion and contraction, internal pressure build-up due {{to the formation of}} volatile gases and vaporisation of moisture; thermally-induced strains; delamination damage; matrix cracking; surface ablation; and <b>softening,</b> <b>melting</b> and fusion of fibres. Many of these processes do not occur in isolation from each other, but usually influence other processes that add to the complexity of the behaviour of composites in fire. Understanding these processes and how they interact is essential to understanding the fire reaction and fire resistive properties of composite materials...|$|E

Four cheeses containing different calcium levels (viz. 0. 65, 0. 48, 0. 42, and 0. 35 %) were manufactured by direct acidification using glucono-δ-lactone on four different occasions. Preacidification of milk {{was done to}} alter the calcium content of the cheeses. Cheeses were made with uniform composition. Lowering of cal-cium to 25, 35, and 45 % levels increased the melt by 1. 4, 2. 1, and 2. 6 times, respectively, 1 d after manufac-ture. Low calcium cheeses softened and melted at lower time and temperatures. These cheeses flowed faster and to a greater extent. Higher proteolysis {{at a faster rate}} was observed in low calcium cheeses. Refrigerated storage up to 30 d also increased melt area, flow rate, extent of flow, and soluble protein and lowered soften-ing and melting times in all the cheeses.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to develop and test a method for {{assessing}} the size and the morphology of biomass fuels and their chars. Severe thermal conditions (high temperature and heating rate) are programmed during the pyrolysis, focusing on characteristics of chars in combustion or gasification. An image analysis program is used to quantitatively study several scanning electron microscopy images of fuel and char samples. Distributions of results are obtained for {{a significant number of}} particles from a statistical point of view. Average values and the standard deviations of the distributions quantify the heterogeneous nature of the fuel and char particles, providing useful parameters for advanced modeling. Size, shape factors (aspect and roundness) and superficial parameters are defined and measured (or calculated) developing a procedure for a low time-consuming analysis. The structural variations caused by the fast release of a high amount of volatile products are evaluated comparing the results obtained on fuel and char particles. The results are discussed to assessing the suitability of the selected parameters and the possibility to quantify <b>softening,</b> <b>melting,</b> shrinking and fragmentation phenomena. The method is applied to two biomass fuels of different origin and chemical composition: wood pellets and olive residue. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to develop and improve a new method for {{investigating}} how different parameters affect the <b>softening</b> and <b>melting</b> of quartz. The method should give quantitative results. Quartz is the stable phase of silica at room temperature, and is used as raw material for silicon production. When silica starts to <b>soften</b> and <b>melt</b> it can react with the surroundings in a furnace. This is undesirable too high in the furnace, because it can cause a more compact charge leading to decreased gas permeability. Softening of silica can also alter the reaction rates. A {{deeper understanding of the}} <b>softening</b> and <b>melting</b> properties of silica can lead to a more thorough selection of new raw materials and efficient furnace operations. Costs and energy consumptions can be decreased. This study has focused on the following parameters effect on softening and heating: temperature, heating rate, quartz type, holding time and particle size. The method used for the investigation was based on the stationary charge in controlled environment (S. C. I. C. E) technique. Carbon crucibles were filled with quartz and silicon carbide, and then heated in an induction furnace. Temperature control was important, and therefore several experiments were performed to establish the uncertainty. After cooling, the crucibles were cut into two halves, so each surface could be studied and the areas of <b>softened</b> and <b>melted</b> silica measured. The new method for investigating <b>softening</b> and <b>melting</b> properties of silica was adequate. Results from the experiments show that a more impure quartz type will <b>soften</b> and <b>melt</b> at a lower temperature than a purer type. Increasing the holding time at maximum temperature also causes the <b>softening</b> and <b>melting</b> to increase. The effect of particle size was inconsistent, but at higher temperature the <b>softening</b> and <b>melting</b> will increase with decreasing particle size. Increasing the heating rate also showed some inconsistent results. At higher temperature the difference was negligible...|$|R
40|$|When using 100 % self-fluxed pellets in {{the blast}} furnace burden, top charged fluxes, {{especially}} the BOF-slag, may cause irregularities in operation. The major reason has been theoretically attributed to the problematic slag formation in the furnace. As the melting of pellets {{is the first step}} of the slag formation process, the <b>softening</b> and <b>melting</b> properties of LKAB's self-fluxed pellets with and without addition of fluxes are studied experimentally. The results show that the <b>softening</b> and <b>melting</b> properties of the two types of LKAB's self-fluxed pellets are quite suitable for blast furnace operation. Contrarily, the melting-down characteristics of BOF-slag are variable and harmful to the slag formation under a reducing atmosphere. Adding 5 % BOF-slag to the self-fluxed pellets can considerably worsen the <b>softening</b> and <b>melting</b> properties of pellets. It can either increase the <b>softening</b> and <b>melting</b> temperature interval substantially or cause the precipitation of solid phases, mainly di-calcium silicates, in the slag.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the variability of ash content and chemical composition of coal ash is crucial when assessing {{the possibility of using}} this raw material in clean coal technologies (CCS). The paper focuses on chemical, technological and quality characteristics of ash from the combustion of lignite from Polish deposits. Ash content on a dry ash-free basis for the samples from 9 deposits varies from 1 to 50 %. The most commonly observed ash content in the studied samples of lignite is in the range between 10 – 20 %. The measured ash melting temperatures from the collected lignite samples have shown that the sintering, <b>softening,</b> <b>melting</b> and flow temperatures, determined in an oxidizing atmosphere (air), are higher than those determined in a reducing atmosphere. In the majority of Polish lignite deposits, the dominant component of ash was SiO 2, followed by CaO. When evaluating the suitability of coal in energy production, with particular emphasis on the combustion and gasification processes, it is also necessary to study the behavior of ash at high temperatures and the impact of ash on the gasification and combustion facilities. Ash fouling and slagging processes, which are heavily dependent on the ash content, composition, melting point and the content of chlorine, phosphorus and sulfur in coal, {{have a negative effect on}} the combustion process...|$|E
40|$|In {{dealing with}} the problem of human {{suffering}} and God’s involvement in it, the book of Job uses a particularly rich metaphorical language. The present article studies the most frequently used groups of metaphors that the protagonist Job uses in describing his own fate and his relation to God. Methodologically, this contribution draws on the central insight of the recent cognitive-linguistic approach to metaphor, namely, that metaphor is not a mere figure of speech or just a matter of style, but is fundamental {{to the way in which}} people think and conceptualise the world. Studying the metaphors in a biblical book like Job, therefore, does not primarily aim to uncover the author’s stylistic mastery, but rather to penetrate the way in which the text exposes its views of the world, of the self and of God. Understanding the metaphors a text uses is therefore a condition for understanding its meaning and its proposed world view. When analysing the metaphors Job uses in his self-descriptions, four groups stand out. First, Job describes his life as a journey or a road. This is a very familiar and straightforward metaphor, but it receives a number of particular elaborations in the book of Job, e. g. when he regards his suffering as an interrupted journey or as an unwanted turn in his path. A second group of metaphors conceptualises life and suffering in terms of light and darkness. This again is a very widespread metaphorical conceptualisation, but nowhere in the Hebrew Bible is it used so often and in so many different variants as in the book of Job. On the other hand, a third group of metaphors is particular to the book of Job; it conceptualises suffering as the result of God’s relentless gaze, from which no escape is possible, except perhaps in death. On several occasions, finally, Job conceptualises his suffering as a process of fluidification (<b>softening,</b> <b>melting),</b> while human coming-into-being is regarded as solidification (hardening of metal, coagulation, pottery production). The different metaphors in the book thus form a cluster of internally consistent and coherent groups that differ considerably the one from the other. This multiplicity of metaphors itself constitutes an invitation to take seriously the figurative language we encounter in our interpersonal and pastoral relations. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|A {{limitation}} in {{numerical modelling}} of the ironmaking blast furnace is {{the inability to}} quantify the effects of particle deformation and subsequent loss of porosity arising from the <b>softening</b> and <b>melting</b> of ferrous materials. Previous attempts to consider deformation focused solely on the macroscopic effects such as resistance to gas flow, with an assumed decrease in porosity proportional to temperature. Instead, it is proposed to approximate particle scale deformation using a modified sub-particle Discrete Element Method approach, where each 2 ̆ 2 ore 2 ̆ 2 particle is represented using an agglomerate of discrete elements with temperature dependent properties. Cohesive forces binding the agglomerate were obtained from standard models (Linear Hysteretic, a simplified Hertz-JKR, and Linear Bonding models).

A {{large part of the}} 3 D printer producers indicates high printing accuracy (positioning accuracies from 100 μm up to 1 μm and layer thickness from 100 μm tо 5 μm). In the process of layers deposition, the material is <b>softened,</b> <b>melted</b> or irradiated with a certain light source to polymerize.

Certain chemical compounds are added by the producers to multiple materials in order to enhance their mechanical and technological properties.

It is generally agreed that the performance of lump ores is inferior to sinter in the test. To understand the factors determining material behaviour, tests were terminated by quenching samples at different temperatures. The samples were then studied under an optical microscope. The formation of a low temperature liquid fayalite caused beds of lump ores to rearrange and contract earlier. Beds of fluxed sinter remained essentially intact with reduction until higher temperatures. The study also showed that results obtained for a mixed burden of 80 % sinter and 20 % lump ore – a ratio used in many blast furnaces – are not different to results obtained from tests using only sinter. This difference increases as the lump ore level is increased. These findings indicate that there is significant interaction between the material types in the test and that results from single material tests should not be used in isolation assess material performance in a blast furnace.
