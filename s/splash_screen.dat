25|$|Also in 2012, Disney Mobile {{launched}} a mobile game titled Where's My Perry? for iOS and Android. It {{was based on}} Disney's popular Where's My Water? game, using similar physics. In this game, Agent P {{is trying to get}} into O.W.C.A. headquarters but the transport tubes are out, so he needs water for the backup underground hydrogenerators. If you struggle or get stuck, Major Monogram and Carl will offer encouragement while Doofenshmirtz will taunt him. Phineas and Ferb never appear in the game except in the opening <b>splash</b> <b>screen.</b> The game was expanded to include levels featuring Doofenshmirtz and other animal agents. The game has a 4.0 rating on iTunes, but has not been updated in more than a year.|$|E

50|$|Since <b>splash</b> <b>screens</b> often {{increase}} the {{wait for the}} desired content and may {{take a long time}} to load, they are not liked by all users. Web <b>splash</b> <b>screens</b> are especially inconvenient for users with slow internet connections as the first page may take longer to load. Moreover, if the user has turned off rich content, such as images, Flash, or Shockwave, the splash page may not load at all. Splash pages and any associated main pages created in Flash often cannot be accessed by search engines or handled by text readers for the blind.|$|R

2500|$|In July 2014, {{an online}} {{debate about the}} ethics of YouTube gaming {{channels}} was sparked {{as a result of}} a survey revealing that some YouTube vloggers received monetary compensation from game developers or publishers in return for recording videos of their games. In response to this discussion, Bain announced on Twitter that he would [...] "be clearly disclosing promotional videos in a <b>splash</b> <b>screen</b> at the start of the video". Disclaimers had previously appeared in the description fields of his videos, but Bain felt this was no longer good enough because YouTube videos that are embedded or that are displayed with certain apps omit that information.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to 2006, {{from around}} 5am or 6am to 9am on Saturday mornings and 4am {{to the end}} of show on Sundays, rage would switch to the weekly Top Fifty from the ARIA singles chart. Rage aired the Top 60 chart from 1 September 1990 to 9 March 1991, and from 8 June 1991 to 6 March 1994. If a video from the Top Fifty was unavailable, {{unsuitable}} or non-existent, it would be replaced by a <b>splash</b> <b>screen</b> of the [...] "rage" [...] logo with the position attained in the charts for the week, the artist's name and the track's title. Also, the videos shown until 6am were uncensored (after this, the rating was set back to G-rated material). However, some clips were unavailable in that form, particularly due to heavier restrictions on clips which originated in the United States. Sometimes, two different video clips for the same song were shown in the one session. When this happens, it was often a live (or sometimes remixed) version that was shown earlier in the night/morning, while the [...] "mainstream" [...] censored version shown after 6am was shown in the Top Fifty due to classification laws in Australia which prevented adult-oriented material being shown in the after-6am timeslot. Since 2005, rage is classified PG when it carries over after 6am.|$|E

40|$|The Web is a new, {{large and}} {{heterogeneous}} community where the interaction among the users {{and the possibility}} offered by technology may modify existing genres or create new ones. In fact, most genres being borrowed from the paper world have undergone adjustments when {{moving on to the}} Web (for instance, online newspapers and online manuals). Also, there is a family of genres, which have been created specifically for the Web, e. g. home pages, <b>splash</b> <b>screens,</b> newsletters, hotlists. Besides these, are there other emerging genres on the Web for which a genre label has not been coined yet? Is it possible to capture genres in formation in an automated way? An experiment using cluster analysis has been set up to provide initial answers to these questions. Results show that the main clusters have a shape which is quite well-defined and show a number of regularities. Interestingly, Web pages appear to have been clustered according to their rhetorical/discoursal types (informational, instructional, argumentative, etc.), rather than genre classes (e. g. sermons and editorials, both argumentative, belong to the same cluster). The perception of rhetorical/discoursal types in Web pages has been confirmed by a small-scale Web user study. ...|$|R
