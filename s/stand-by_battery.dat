5000|$|A reserve battery, {{also called}} <b>stand-by</b> <b>battery,</b> {{is a primary}} battery where part is {{isolated}} until the battery needs to be used. When long storage is required, reserve batteries are often used, since the active chemicals of the cell are segregated until needed, thus reducing self-discharge.|$|E
5000|$|Wet cell <b>stand-by</b> (stationary) <b>batteries</b> {{designed}} for deep discharge {{are commonly used}} in large backup power supplies for telephone and computer centres, grid energy storage, and off-grid household electric power systems. [...] Lead-acid batteries are used in emergency lighting and to power sump pumps in case of power failure.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new device and circuit scheme that {{drastically}} suppresses the stand-by leakage current for the deep sub- 0. 1 pm era {{while maintaining the}} circuit speed. Applying boosted gate voltage on the low leakage switches with higher V, and thicker To,, extremely low <b>stand-by</b> power for <b>battery</b> type application is achieved, while degradation of circuit performance and an increase of area overhead are sufficiently suppressed. The combination with a negative gate voltage scheme {{and the application of}} the boosted voltage scheme to SRAMs are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} to integrate a Solide Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) prime mover and ZEBRA batteries, with the aim to fulfill a domestic user energy demand and to reduce the primary energy consumption, thereby, to enhance the total efficiency in a μ-CHP (Combined Heat and Power) application on a yearly basis. A realistic operational sequence of the SOFC-ZEBRA integration has been calculated using simple logic conditions. Both electric and thermal integration have been considered, in order to exploit the SOFC residual heat for the <b>battery</b> <b>stand-by</b> feeding. The key advantage of this system architecture is that the SOFC is operated without major load variations close to constant load, resulting in longer lifetime and thus reducing total costs of operation. Eventually, a comparison with alternative μ-CHP technologies has been carried out, highlighting the SOFC-ZEBRA potential...|$|R
50|$|The LG Optimus 4X HD is {{the first}} phone to feature Nvidia's Tegra 3 chip {{offering}} significant mobile gaming performance at release. LG Optimus 4X HD {{was also the first}} phone announced with a quad core processor. The chip has four physical cores clocked at 1.5 GHz in addition to a lower-clocked fifth core. The fifth core is clocked up to 500 MHz and runs when the handset is idle or doing only simple tasks, less-demanding tasks such as active standby and music playback.LG Optimus 4X HD is equipped with a True HD IPS display with Ultra high resolution 313PPI, packaged in an 8.9 mm-thick, prism-edged design. The device comes in black and white The LG Optimus 4X HD also includes a 12-core graphics processing unit. There is an 8-megapixel backside-illuminated sensor camera on the rear with LED flash, HDR, continuous shot, support 1080p Full HD video recorder and 1.3MP camera on the front for video, conferencing or self-portrait. The phone also includes a Li-Ion 2150 mAh <b>battery,</b> <b>stand-by</b> up to 730 h (2G) / up to 686 h (3G), talk time up to 9 h 20 min (2G) / Up to 10 hours & 50 minutes (3G). MicroSD card slot up to 64 GB, internal memory 16 GB (12 GB user available), and 1 GB RAM. It has a highly capable face unlock feature which works with the front-facing camera.|$|R
40|$|Aluminum (Al) {{is a very}} {{promising}} energy carrier given its high capacity and energy density, low cost, earth abundance and environmental benignity. The Al/air battery {{as a kind of}} metal/air electrochemical cell attracts tremendous attention. Traditional Al/air batteries suffer from the self-corrosion and related safety problems. In this work, three new approaches were investigated to tackle these challenges and to develop high-performance Al/air cells: (1) incorporate an additional hydrogen/air fuel cell to utilize the hydrogen from the parasitic reaction; (2) utilize organic alkaline anolyte instead of aqueous one in a dual- or tri- electrolyte membrane fuel cell; (3) integrate the microfluidic fuel cell structure into the Al/air battery. The self-corrosion reaction is either turned into a beneficial reaction or significantly inhibited through these approaches. Moreover, the Al/air cells exhibited improved current and/or voltage performance. With an alkaline anolyte and an acidic catholyte, the cell exhibited an open-circuit voltage of 2. 2 V, the highest value so far reported. The capacity and energy density of the Al/air battery increased over 20 folds when conventional aqueous electrolyte was replaced with the selected organic electrolyte. The adoption of microfluidic fuel cell concept effectively miniaturized the Al/air cell, eliminated the self-corrosion during <b>battery</b> <b>stand-by,</b> and led to a higher current and power output than membrane-based cells due to reduced cell resistance. Overall, Al/air electrochemical cells with better performance and higher feasibility were developed based on the above three approaches, when they are used alone or collectively. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
