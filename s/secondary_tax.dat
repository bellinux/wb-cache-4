This phenomenon {{is known as}} the survival processing effect. Recently, inconsistent results were reported on whether the size of the survival processing effect is affected by cognitive load. Whereas Kroneisen, Rummel, and Erdfelder (Memory 22 : 92 - 102, 2014) observed that the survival processing effect vanishes under dual-task conditions, Stillman, Coane, Profaci,Howard, and Howard (Memory & Cognition 42 : 175 - 185, 2014, Experiment 1) found that the size of survival processing effect is essentially unaffected by a cognitively demanding secondary task. In three experiments, we investigated the differences between these studies to achieve a better understanding of dual-task effects on the survival-processing advantage.

The combined resources of the agent coupled to a malleable environment in the high interactivity condition did not soak up completely the resources depletion caused by articulatory suppression since performance was affected by the secondary task, but it was sufficiently robust to ensure efficient calculations.|$|R

The results of the negative differences in proportion to the positive differences measured were then compared to the size of STC applicable in 1993 and 1995. The results of the comparison were that STC had no negative effect on the total dividends paid on the companies used in the sample and the majority of companies constantly increased dividend payments. The study did not distinguish between the different origins of dividends as research advises that the origins of dividends have changed during the increase and decrease of STC.

However, TIPS are not free from all risk — they are still subject to {{liquidity}} risk (due to a thin <b>secondary</b> market) and <b>tax</b> disadvantage risk (due a specific tax liability in their cash flows). In this thesis, I demonstrate through various empirical models that liquidity and tax disadvantage premia are priced into TIPS yields in order to compen-sate for these risks.

My results also weakly support a time-variant TIPS tax disadvantage premium that averages 56 bp over the same time period. Furthermore, I find that these two premia are principally driven by the uncertain volatility of expected future inflation. Consequently, {{as a result of these}} premia, it is on average 3 bp more expensive for the Trea-sury to issue a TIPS rather than a conventional nominal bond, which has cost the Treasury over $ 221 million. So why does the Treasury continue to issue TIPS if they do not in fact lower borrowing costs, as was the intention of the program? It is possible that TIPS offer several nonmarketable public benefits that offset their additional cost, thus making the program worthwhile for the Treasury and market participants alike...|$|R

As a shareholder, one should rationally be indifferent to receiving returns {{in the form of}} dividend payouts or value growth. Markets are, however, not perfectly efficient and investors are not completely rational. The purpose of this research project was to analyse and quantify the impact on the behaviour of South Africa's equity market, if any, resulting from the decision to replace the <b>Secondary</b> <b>Tax</b> on Companies system with the Dividend Withholding Tax regime at a higher effective tax rate. An events study methodology that was quantitative and causal in nature was used to test five hypotheses for three separate events that collaboratively indicate whether there was an impact from this change in dividend regulation or not. The results align with empirical evidence from international literature and indicate that there was indeed a significant, negative equity market impact resulting from the transition. The negative reaction is primarily attributable to the hike in the dividend tax rate rather than the reduction in regulatory complexity and was shown to be more significant for higher dividend yield firms.

40|$|On 21 February 2007, the Minister of Finance {{announced}} that government proposes {{to phase out}} <b>secondary</b> <b>Tax</b> on Companies (STC) and {{to replace it with}} a new tax on dividends. It is proposed that this process will take place in two phases. The first phase will see a decrease in the rate of STC from 12. 5 % to 10 %, with effect from 1 October 2007, and a redefinition of the base to apply to all distributions. It is proposed that phase two will commence during 2008 and that it will introduce a dividend tax at the shareholder level. The administrative enforcement of this dividend tax will be by way of a withholding tax that the company deducts from the dividend and pay over to SARS on behalf of the shareholders. It is expected that the introduction of the withholding tax should be complete by the end of 2008. The future abolishment of STC will be viewed as a relief to accountants, as the accounting treatment of STC has always been contentious. Generally speaking the accounting for a withholding tax is much easier and internationally more common. Until STC is however abandoned the accounting considerations remain relevant and in order to be in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) due consideration should be given to the accounting treatment in terms of these standards...|$|E
40|$|The {{classical}} system of taxation, whereby companies are taxed without a deduction for dividends paid and shareholders are taxed on their dividend receipts, results in double taxation of dividends. Split rate and imputation {{systems have been}} developed {{in an attempt to}} mitigate the effects of double taxation of dividends. Double taxation of dividends and differences between corporate and maximum individual marginal tax rates result in corporate tax systems lacking neutrality. Distortions arise between organisational forms, between debt and equity financing and between the retention and distribution of profits. Various methods of integrating corporate and individual taxes have been advocated to overcome the lack of neutrality caused by corporate taxes. Following the introduction of the South African Income Tax Act in 1914, a number of taxes relating to dividends have existed. These have included a Dividend Tax, Non-resident Shareholder's Tax, Undistributed Profits Tax and <b>Secondary</b> <b>Tax</b> on Companies, hereafter referred to as STC. STC is a tax on net dividends declared and results in distributed income being taxed at higher rates than retained income. Despite the implementation of group relief provisions, STC results in an inhibition on the reinvestment of profits {{within the context of a}} group of companies. It is also a major cause of the lack of neutrality of the South African corporate tax system. As a result of the lack of neutrality and inhibition of group reinvestment caused by STC, a full imputation system is suggested as an alternative to replace STC. ...|$|E
30|$|One of {{the main}} reasons of {{development}} of the modeling is of course to be able to provide more adequate support during navigation, resulting in better information seeking performance of participants. Summarizing the main results of the current experiment regarding user performance, we found that the model-generated support was helpful to improve the performance of users in terms of accuracy, disorientation, and total time needed to perform the search task (Table  4). Regarding the second aim of this article we can thus conclude that automatic model-generated support using a cognitive model can be useful for participants. Multi-tasking had no negative effects, and on disorientation even a positive effect. Apparently we were not successful in bringing about a secondary task that was taxing working memory. Even in the no-support conditions the differences in accuracy or total time needed were minimal between the multi and no multi-tasking conditions. Regarding disorientation we even did find a positive effect of multi-tasking. This effect is in line with a study reported in [26], where it is suggested that interruption is not always as deleterious to productivity as one might expect - although it creates more stress (which we did not measure). We interpret this pattern as that these groups might have had a higher motivation (already from the beginning or due to the instruction) for doing their search tasks. In subsequent studies a stricter and more <b>taxing</b> <b>secondary</b> task has to be used.|$|R
40|$|Fiscal {{redistribution}} varies substantially across U. S. states, {{both on the}} tax {{and spending}} side. A compensating differential framework is used to show that greater redistribution will tend to increase the gross wage of skilled workers but that any increase could be offset by stronger preferences for redistribution. An increase in gross wages raises the cost of output in the more redistributive state, leading to a predicted decline in income and output. To test the model, five- and ten-year per capita and aggregate growth rates are estimated {{as a function of}} initial measures of tax and expenditure incidence. Data are a four-period panel of U. S. states from 1977 to 1995. Tax progressivity is measured both overall and for the income tax alone. Expenditure progressivity is measured by spending on welfare and higher education, and the state share of elementary and <b>secondary</b> education spending. <b>Tax</b> structure and welfare spending are instrumented. State tax progressivity shows no effect on growth. Welfare spending has a negative effect on aggregate income growth but not on per capita income. Higher education spending is unrelated to growth. Fiscal spillovers within regions are asymmetric. Progressive taxation and more higher education spending by a state's geographic neighbors have positive effects on own-state growth. The asymmetry in tax effects explains why interstate tax competition does not lead to geographic convergence in fiscal structures.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{model the}} overall and income {{specific}} {{effect of a}} 20 % tax on sugar sweetened drinks on the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the UK. DESIGN: Econometric and comparative risk assessment modelling study. SETTING: United Kingdom. POPULATION: Adults aged 16 and over. INTERVENTION: A 20 % tax on sugar sweetened drinks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the overall and income specific changes in the number and percentage of overweight (body mass index ≥ 25) and obese (≥ 30) adults in the UK following {{the implementation of the}} <b>tax.</b> <b>Secondary</b> outcomes were the effect by age group (16 - 29, 30 - 49, and ≥ 50 years) and by UK constituent country. The revenue generated from the tax and the income specific changes in weekly expenditure on drinks were also estimated. RESULTS: A 20 % tax on sugar sweetened drinks was estimated {{to reduce the number of}} obese adults in the UK by 1. 3 % (95 % credible interval 0. 8 % to 1. 7 %) or 180, 000 (110, 000 to 247, 000) people and the number who are overweight by 0. 9 % (0. 6 % to 1. 1 %) or 285, 000 (201, 000 to 364, 000) people. The predicted reductions in prevalence of obesity for income thirds 1 (lowest income), 2, and 3 (highest income) were 1. 3 % (0. 3 % to 2. 0 %), 0. 9 % (0. 1 % to 1. 6 %), and 2. 1 % (1. 3 % to 2. 9 %). The effect on obesity declined with age. Predicted annual revenue was £ 276 m (£ 272 m to £ 279 m), with estimated increases in total expenditure on drinks for income thirds 1, 2, and 3 of 2. 1 % (1. 4 % to 3. 0 %), 1. 7 % (1. 2 % to 2. 2 %), and 0. 8 % (0. 4 % to 1. 2 %). CONCLUSIONS: A 20 % tax on sugar sweetened drinks would lead to a reduction in the prevalence of obesity in the UK of 1. 3 % (around 180, 000 people). The greatest effects may occur in young people, with no significant differences between income groups. Both effects warrant further exploration.

Some accounting commentators have indicated that they find it anomalous to recognise a deferred tax asset in respect of unused STC credits, while no liability is recognised for the STC that would be payable on the future distribution of retained earnings. The objective of the study is to consider whether it is conceptually anomalous to recognise a deferred tax asset for unused STC credits while no liability is raised for the STC that would become payable on future dividend declarations on profits already recognised in the financial statements.

40|$|In April 2012, South Africa {{changed its}} tax system on dividends. South Africa {{switched}} from using <b>Secondary</b> <b>Tax</b> on Companies (STC) to Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) {{in an effort}} to align with the international standards and eliminate the perception of a higher tax rate. This paper attempts to establish the role of taxes in determining the ex-dividend day share price movements by comparing the pre-tax change and post-tax change in price drop ratio (PDR). In this study, I compare the mean and median PDR before and after the April 2012 Act using a t-test and Wilcoxon Mann Whitney test respectively. Furthermore, this study employs a fixed effects regression model to analyse the PDR change on the ex-dividend day before and after the April 2012 Act. The advantage of using a fixed effects model is that it controls for omitted time-invariant predictors so that the model is not biased because of omitted characteristics. I find {{a significant difference in the}} mean and median PDR before and after the tax change. Furthermore, I find that ex-dividend prices vary systematically with taxes as predicted by Elton & Gruber (1970 : 68) hence supporting the tax-based explanation for ex-dividend day prices. This research is particularly interesting because this is the first tax clientele study in South Africa and the 2012 Act provides a natural experiment where the tax effect can be isolated more effectively compared with other studies that have been done before. Furthermore, this research spans over a narrow time frame thereby reducing the effect of other factors that may also drive ex-dividend day prices...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MAcc) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2001. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Scrip {{dividends}} {{have become}} increasingly popular in South Africa SInce the introduction of <b>secondary</b> <b>tax</b> on companies (STC) in the 1993 budget. There {{is more than one}} approach to the treatment of scrip dividend schemes for accounting purposes, i. e. the reinvestment approach and the capitalisation issue approach. Unfortunately guidance {{in the form of a}} statement or guideline from the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants has not been forthcoming. Companies in the United States of America account for stock dividends (capitalisation issues) in a variety of ways and several studies have analysed the effect of these accounting treatments on retained earnings and the retained earnings hypothesis. Several empirical studies in the United States of America and the United Kingdom have documented marked differences in the ability of companies in these countries to make distributions to shareholders. For this reason the accounting treatment of stock dividends and scrip dividends in these countries was examined and compared to the methods used in South Africa. Earnings per share is often used by financial analysts to analyse and compare companies. The methods used in South Africa to account for scrip dividends result in different calculations of earnings per share and therefore the effect of the different methods was examined. This study concludes that the reinvestment approach is theoretically the most acceptable accounting treatment of scrip dividend schemes In South Africa. A representative sample of companies which declared scrip dividends in the period 1993 to 1999 was selected to determine how these schemes are implemented in the South African economy. These companies' financial statements were analysed to determine if the scrip dividend schemes were treated in terms of the accounting method proposed in this study and if the necessary information was disclosed in the financial statements. This study finds that different accounting approaches are used in South Africa, that earnings per share and <b>secondary</b> <b>tax</b> on companies are not calculated consistently for accounting purposes and that the information disclosed to the users of the financial statements differs from company to company. It is recommended that the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants issue accounting guidelines to the drafters of financial statements regarding scrip dividend schemes. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die verklaring van skripdividende het in Suid-Afrika in gewildheid begin toeneem met die inwerkingstelling van sekondere belasting op maatskappye (SBM) in die 1993 -begroting. Daar is meer as een metode om skripdividendskemas rekeningkundig te verantwoord, naamlik die herbeleggingsbenadering en die kapitalisasieuitgiftebenadering. Die Suid-Afrikaanse Instituut vir Geoktrooieerde Rekenmeesters het egter op hierdie stadium nog nie 'n rekeningkundige standpunt of riglyn oor die rekeningkundige verantwoording van skripdividendskemas uitgereik nie. In die Verenigde State van Amerika kan maatskappye kapitalisasie-uitgifte op verskillende maniere rekeningkundig verantwoord en verskeie studies het die invloed ondersoek wat hierdie metodes op verdeelbare reserwes en die behoue wins-hipotese het. Verder het studies wat in die Verenigde State van Amerika en die Verenige Koningkryk gedoen is, bevind dat hierdie lande se beperkings op verdelings aan aandeelhouers baie van mekaar verskil en om die rede is die metodes wat in die lande toegepas word om kapitalisasie-uitgifte en skripdividendskemas rekeningkundig te verantwoord, ondersoek en met die metodes vergelyk wat in Suid-Afrika toegepas kan word. Aangesien verdienste per aandeel dikwels deur finansiele ontleders gebruik word om maatskappye te ontleed en met mekaar te vergelyk en omdat die metodes wat in Suid- Afrika toegepas kan word verskillende berekeninge van verdienste per aandeel tot gevoIg het, is die uitwerking wat die verskillende metodes op die berekening van verdienste per aandeeI het ook ontleed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{estimate}} {{the economic impact of}} farm input manufacturing and value-added agricultural processing in the North Dakota economy. Economic impacts for these agriculturally-linked sectors are in addition to those for direct agricultural (crops and livestock) production. This analysis will provide state-level estimates of key economic indicators including levels of business activity, retail trade, personal income, <b>secondary</b> employment and <b>tax</b> revenues associated with these agriculturally-linked sectors. A survey of the 76 farm input manufacturing and 160 agricultural processing firms in North Dakota was conducted to obtain expenditure patterns. In-state outlays by these firms were allocated to sectors of the economy and divided by their respective number of employees to obtain a per employee expenditure for each economic sector. Per worker expenditures for the farm input manufacturing sector were multiplied by that sector's total employment (2, 418) to estimate the industry's total expenditures. Agricultural processing per worker outlays were also multiplied by total employment (7, 104) to estimate the total expenditures for this sector. Total expenditures for farm input manufacturing were estimated to be $ 146. 8 million in 2002, and total agricultural processing expenditures were $ 361. 9 million. These expenditures were applied to the North Dakota Input-Output Model to estimate economic impacts. The North Dakota Input-Output Model is a tool for tabulating and describing the linkages or interdependencies between various industrial groups within an economy. This model uses interdependence coefficients, or multipliers, to measure the total level of economic activity generated in each sector from an additional dollar of expenditures in a given sector. Total business activity generated from the in-state expenditures amounted to $ 482. 2 million for the farm input manufacturing firms and $ 1, 201. 4 million for agricultural processing firms, giving a total of $ 1, 683. 6 million. Retail sales for the farm input manufacturing and agricultural processing firms were $ 105. 2 million and $ 243. 2 million, respectively. Total retail sales were estimated to be $ 348. 4 million for the two agriculturally-linked sectors. Another indicator of the economic impact, personal income, was estimated to be $ 174. 3 million for farm input manufacturing, $ 380. 9 million for agricultural processing, with a total of $ 555. 2 million. In addition to the 9, 522 direct workers employed by these firms, another 16, 272 secondary (indirect and induced) jobs were created. State revenue was enhanced by $ 27. 4 million as the result of sales and use, personal income, and corporate income tax collections resulting from the business activity for the farm input manufacturing and agricultural processing firms. economic impact, farm input manufacturing, value-add agricultural processing, economic indicators, Agribusiness,...|$|R
40|$|Dual {{residence}} in the taxation of individuals Each country {{has the right to}} determine on which grounds and to what extent it exercises its tax authority. In the case of individuals a country usually bases its right to levy taxes on the connection between the country and the individual, or the country and the income or wealth in question. This thesis deals with the connection that exists between the country and the individual. Under domestic tax law systems a separation is usually made into full and limited tax liability. Full tax liability arises when there are strong ties between the individual and the state. Residence is usually considered a strong tie that results in full tax liability. A person who is resident in a country, and therefore subject to full tax liability, is usually taxed on his world wide income. However, if the person is not resident, the state does not claim the right to tax the individual as such, but taxes income that arises within the territory of the country. When determining {{residence in}} one country, no consideration is given to whether the person is also resident in other countries. Consequently, individuals can as a result of cross border movement be considered resident both in the country of arrival and the country of departure. When two countries both consider an individual resident, dual residence arises. The purpose of this thesis is to analyse three aspects of dual residence. First and foremost, national rules on residence will be analysed, as well as how dual residence occurs in practice. Secondly, the rules on how to determine tax residence for tax treaty purposes are discussed. Thirdly, the tax consequences of dual residence will be investigated. The emphasis will be on the first two aspects of dual residence mentioned. The thesis is based on a dogmatic approach to legal research. Some elements of comparative methods of research are also present. A person who is resident in Finland is subject to full tax liability in Finland. Residence for income tax purposes is determined in the income tax act (ITA) § 11. According to ITA § 11 a person is resident in Finland if he has his main abode and home in Finland, stays over six months in Finland or falls under the three-year rule. Finnish nationals who leave Finland are {{as a result of the}} three-year rule considered resident the year of departure and the three following years. Limited tax liability can arise before the three- year period ends if the individual can produce evidence that he lacks substantial ties to Finland. The Finnish rules on residence are partly problematic. The rules on when a visit to Finland has fulfilled the six months requirement are unclear. Also, the three-year rule does not specify what a substantial tie is. The three-year rule furthermore distinguishes between Finnish nationals and foreign nationals. Different tax consequences depending on nationality can be problematic from an EU perspective. A short analysis of the current ECJ cases, however, indicates that the three-year rule is probably in conformity with EU law. Residence is also used to determine tax liability for the purpose of other taxes, such as the gift and inheritance tax, car tax, municipal tax and social security contributions. Each above-mentioned tax has its own notion of residence. The different concepts of residence are compared with the residence concept that is used for income tax purposes. The comparison led to the observation that the residence concept for income tax purposes can impact on the other residence concepts. Usually residence for other tax purposes does not impact on the residence status for income tax purposes. However, the tax authorities claim that belonging to the Finnish social security system is a substantial tie according to the three-year rule. The Finnish rules on residence for income tax purposes are in many ways interesting in comparison to other countries rules on residence. A comparison has been made with Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, the United Kingdom and the USA. Most of the above-mentioned countries have fairly recently amended and modernized their rules on residence. The comparison demonstrates that the Finnish rules on residence are outdated and in need of reformation. For instance, nationality does not carry any weight when determining tax liability in most other countries (except for the USA). When a Finnish national moves abroad, he is usually subject to full tax liability in the country of arrival, and at the same time subject to full tax liability in Finland due to the three-year rule. The resulting dual residence is solved by tax treaty, provided that the countries have concluded a treaty. For tax treaty purposes a person can only have one tax treaty residence at a time. Residence for tax treaty purposes is determined through the tie breaker in article 4 (2). The state of residence has the primary right to tax the individual. The tie breaker is, however, problematic, since the criteria on which residence is decided are partly ambiguous and can be interpreted in different ways. Therefore the general rules on tax treaty interpretation have to be considered. Rules on tax treaty interpretation can be found in domestic legislation, international law, the Vienna convention, article 3 (2) of tax treaties, and in the commentaries to the model tax convention. Some of the rules on interpretation can lead to different outcomes. The parties can also have diverging information about the individual s personal circumstances. Therefore it is possible that two countries cannot reach an agreement on which country should be the individual s state of residence according to article 4. When both countries claim to be the state of residence, the conflict shall be settled by the mutual agreement procedure in article 25 of the tax treaty. The mutual agreement procedure is time consuming and results cannot be guaranteed. In Finland there are no publications by the tax authorities on the mutual agreement procedure, and the procedure is hence not very well known. Therefore, I have tried to describe how the mutual agreement procedure is executed in practice. In 2008 the OECD added an arbitration clause to its model convention as a final means to solve tax treaty disputes that have not been solved by the mutual agreement procedure. Finland has not, however, included the clause in its treaties. Dual residence can result in several different consequences for the taxation of individuals, and the possible consequences are analysed in this thesis. The taxation of dual resident individuals can vary greatly from one situation to another depending on domestic legislation in both countries of residence, the type of income, the source of income, the tax treaties articles and the interpretation of the tax treaty. The taxation of dual resident persons can be divided into situations where no tax treaty has been concluded, a tax treaty exists and Finland is not the state of residence, and situations where both countries claim residence status according to the tax treaty. Some Finnish tax treaties include the three-year rule in article 23. According to the clause the source country is granted a more comprehensive, but <b>secondary,</b> right to <b>tax</b> persons who are resident according to domestic tax law, although the residence state for tax treaty purposes is in the other country. To demonstrate the impact of dual residence on the taxation of individuals, the taxation in Finland of interest, dividend, capital gains, salary and pensions is described through practical examples. Situations of dual residence can also have other tax implications, e. g. is there a progressive impact on other income, and how are deductions and losses taken into account when Finland is not the state of residence according to article 4 ? Dual residence does not necessarily cause double taxation as a result of national rules on credit and exemption and the elimination of double taxation. The concluding chapter sheds light on some of the most urgent problems in the current legislation on residence and presents some suggestions for improvements. The rules on {{residence in the}} domestic income tax act are scrutinized in detail. It is suggested that the nationality criterion in the three-year rule is abolished, and that substantial ties are defined in the income tax act. Furthermore, it is also suggested that the national rules on the elimination of double taxation are elucidated and that the scale of application is extended. On the international level it is recommended that article 3 (2) in the OECD model tax convention is amended to primarily recommend an interpretation according to the context. Some minor adjustments are also presented to the articles on residence and mutual agreement. Varje stat får självständigt reglera utsträckningen av och kriterierna för sin beskattningsbehörighet. I fråga om fysiska personer baserar sig statens beskattningsbehörighet vanligen på antingen anknytningar mellan staten och den skattskyldige eller anknytningar mellan staten och skatteobjektet. Denna forskning tar sin utgångspunkt i förhållandet mellan den skattskyldige och en stat. I Finland gör man en uppdelning i allmänt och begränsat skattskyldiga personer. En person som enligt inkomstskattelagen är bosatt i Finland anses vara allmänt skattskyldig, och beskattas således för sina globala inkomster. Alla andra är begränsat skattskyldiga, och beskattas bara för inkomst med sin källa i Finland. Andra länder har vanligen motsvarande regler. Således kan det vid gränsöverskridande rörlighet hända att avfärdslandet anser att den skattskyldige fortsättningsvis är skatterättsligt bosatt där, medan allmän skattskyldighet aktualiseras i det nya vistelselandet. Om två länder samtidigt anser att en och samma person är bosatt och allmänt skattskyldig i landet i fråga uppstår dubbelboende. I denna forskning granskas tre skeden av dubbelboende. Först behandlas hur boende enligt nationell rätt och dubbelboende uppstår. För det andra analyseras hur dubbelboendekonflikter löses genom bestämmandet av hemvist i de fall då skatteavtal ingåtts. För det tredje redogörs för de skattekonsekvenser dubbelboendesituationer får. Boken avslutas med förslag för hur nationell och internationell rätt kunde utvecklas...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Tax)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The tax {{world as}} {{we knew it was}} turned upside down on 13 September 2007 when the Supreme Court of Appeal (“SCA”) {{announced}} its decision to deem the right to use an interest-free loan as an amount that accrued to the taxpayers in the case Commissioner for South African Revenue Service v Brummeria Renaissance (Pty) Ltd and others 69 SATC 205. The findings of SCA brought about a “great deal of consternation in the business world” (Loubser, 2007 : 20). Due to the controversy {{as a result of this}} case, SARS drafted an Interpretation Note that illustrates the reasoning and tax treatment of an interest-free loan. On 30 June 2010, Interpretation Note No 58 was finally issued by SARS, providing guidance with regard to “an amount” that “accrues” to a taxpayer for the purposes of the gross income definition. This Interpretation Note will have a significant impact on a number of taxpayers. The purpose of this study is to understand the nature of an interest-free loan and identify its tax implications. The methodology followed in this study will be that of qualitative research. This will be conducted through analyzing the nature of a loan, specifically an interest-free loan, the gross income definition, including the value and timing of such amount, and whether a deduction may be claimed in respect of an interest-free loan. Notwithstanding the above, the study also includes an investigation of other taxes inter alia capital gains tax, donations tax, value-added tax, <b>secondary</b> <b>tax</b> on companies and newly proposed dividends tax.
