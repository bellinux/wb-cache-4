Each student is expected to question and comment upon the text, to respond to one other’s insights, actively taking part in every discussion.... Students know their insights matter; they have something to offer to their peers, and {{to the life of the}} text being discussed. Some <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> exuberant than others, some would rather talk than listen; others may be a bit shy. The professor/facilitator must make sure that each student has a chance to shine, that each can feel confident, each can have the courage to ask what they think might be a stupid question. What are feared to be stupid questions are often the most provocative ones.|$|E

African American and Latino college students are food insecure to greater extent than Asian and White college students. Three-fourths of college students who are food insecure receive some form of financial aid {{and the majority of}} these students are employed. It has been found that food insecurity at the community college level is far higher for students concentrated in mathematics, developmental writing, and reading. Food insecure <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to consider dropping out of college and are less likely to stay on track toward obtaining their academic goals than those who are food secure.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} is an attempt made to examine the issue related to reading habits of {{professional}} and non professional students. The issues studied are their dependency on libraries. items that they read, problems encountered by them and so no. A total of 116 students (56 professionals and 60 non-professionals) served as the sample for the present study. The data was collected by questionnaire. MANOVA ware applied {{to find out the}} difference between course type and gender on various issues. Results revealed that professional <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> dependent on public libraries and non-professional <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> dependent on home libraries. Professional students had more interest in employment and value based, and non-professional <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> interested on entertainment, science and technology and International affairs. Professional students had more frequency of reading in business newspapers and subject journals; whereas non-professional students had more frequency of reading general magazines. Professional students had more problems related to reading like smoking & other habits, hetero sexual interests, family problems, part-time work. library oriented teaching. parental conflict, illiteracy of parents, emotional imbalance, and poverty & rural areas, than non-professional students. Gender-wise comparisons revealed that male <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> dependent on home libraries and female <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> dependent on public libraries. Male <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> interested in employment and value based items, whereas female <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> interested in political, international and agricultural and environment related items.

25|$|Promoting {{intrinsic}} motivation {{and problem solving}} are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. <b>Students</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> creative {{when they see a}} task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake.

Some of the major changes are: an emphasis on the use of evidence to support answers, a shift away from obscure vocabulary to words that <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to encounter in college and career, a math section that is focused on fewer areas, a return to the 1600-point score scale, an optional essay, and the removal of penalty for wrong answers (rights-only scoring).

As the profession becomes <b>more</b> internationalized, it <b>is</b> critical to accept that different nations may still advocate differing treatments for similar issues. This study evaluates whether the accountants of tomorrow already display differences in their attitudes, based upon nationality. The attitudes of final year accountancy students from three countries, Malaysia, Australia and Ire land we re compared across some ethical scenarios. Significant differences were found to exist based upon nationality. When confronted with bribery/corruption scenarios, Malaysian <b>students</b> <b>were</b> most likely to refuse participation but do nothing about them. Australian <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to inform the relevant authorities.

2500|$|For many parents, the {{decision}} {{of whether or not}} to enroll students into school-based speech therapy or privately practiced therapy is challenging. Because school-based speech therapy is run under state guidelines and funds, the process of assessment and qualification is more strict. To qualify for in-school speech therapy, students must meet the state's criteria on language testing and speech standardization. Due to such requirements, some students may not be assessed in an efficient time frame or their needs may be undermined by criteria. For a private clinic, <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to qualify for therapy because it is a paid service with more availability.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to perform a needs {{assessment}} for pharmacy practitioners and measure the attitudes of both pharmacy practitioners and students regarding alternative therapies. A 15 -item-five-point scale questionnaire designed to measure the educational needs and attitudes of pharmacists regarding complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) was developed and mailed to 200 randomly selected practitioners. After two mailings, 94 (47 percent) were returned. A {{modified version of the}} questionnaire was administered to 35 students pharmacy students. The returned questionnaires were tabulated and identical items were statistically compared using nonparametric analyses. Significant differences were the following: practitioners were less likely to favor pharmacists becoming practitioners of CAM; practitioners believed those alternative therapies offered by pharmacists would decrease the public’s respect for the profession; <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to believe that sufficient evidence exists supporting the use of some alternative therapies; <b>student’s</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to believe that pharmacy as a profession should aggressively pursue opportunities in alternative medicine; <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to refer a patient to a practitioner of CAM; and <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to believe that alternative therapies will offer new means for the pharmacist to develop primary care services.
