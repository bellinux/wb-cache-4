The surveying profession is currently facing the biggest challenge in its modern history.

However, being filled-in by the employer, the <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> Earnings <b>Survey</b> (SES) is also more likely to report only legal workers and wages and hours of work more in line with those fixed by the rules (the law and the {{reference}} collective agreement). Moreover, the SES focuses only on firms with more than 10 employees in the business sector, hence excluding agriculture and the public sector and therefore does not cover micro firms and the agriculture sector where non-compliance is likely to be more prevalent.

30|$|I {{have used}} {{administrative}} linked employer-employee {{data from the}} German Federal Statistical Office (German <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> Earnings <b>Survey</b> 2006) to estimate the wage differentials between workers with FTCs and with permanent contracts. Mean wage differentials and wage differentials across the wage distribution are significantly negative to the disadvantage of workers with FTCs. Worker characteristics account for {{about half of the}} unconditional mean wage differential. The wage disadvantage of workers with FTCs is further significantly reduced by the inclusion of occupation and firm fixed effects. Quantile regressions have additionally shown that the wage differential is larger at the lower tail of the wage distribution but still significant in the middle and upper parts of the wage distribution. Overall, the findings show neither any evidence for compensating wage differentials nor evidence for equal pay, despite legislation on the latter. Due to the cross section nature <b>of</b> the German <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> Earnings <b>Survey,</b> no worker fixed effects could be taken into account, which might be another important source of omitted variable bias (Mertens and McGinnity 2004) than analyzed in this paper, which has explicitly dealt with firm heterogeneity. Therefore, a panel design <b>of</b> the German <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> Earnings <b>Survey</b> would be welcomed that allows the inclusion of firm and worker fixed effects in regression analyses.|$|R

30|$|From an {{empirical}} perspective, {{it is well}} established that workers with fixed-term contracts (FTCs) earn on average significant lower wages than workers with permanent contracts. Some studies also explore the wage differentials across the wage distribution and find larger than average wage differentials at the lower tail of the wage distribution and low but still significant wage disadvantages for FTCs {{at the top of}} the wage distribution. Due to data limitations previous studies, at least for Germany, suffer from the absence of the information about a worker’s workplace so that within-firm wage differentials cannot be estimated. Consequently, the estimated wage differentials might suffer from an omitted variable bias due to unobserved firm characteristics. In order to deal with this issue, I use an administrative linked employer-employee data set from the German Federal Statistical Office—the German <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> Earnings <b>Survey</b> 2006. Due to its large sample size, the German <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> Earnings <b>Survey</b> is also more suitable to analyze the wage differentials across the wage distribution than smaller survey data sets.|$|R

30|$|Our {{empirical}} {{analysis is}} based on a combination of two large data sets spanning the period 1999 – 2010. The first is the <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> Earnings <b>Survey</b> (SES). It covers all firms operating in Belgium that employ at least 10 workers and with economic activities within sections C to K of the NACE nomenclature (Rev. 1). The survey contains a wealth of information, provided by the human resource departments of firms, both on the characteristics of the latter (e.g. sector of activity, number of workers, level of collective wage bargaining) and on the individuals working there (e.g. age, education, gross earnings, paid hours, gender, occupation, etc.). 3 The SES provides no financial information. Therefore, it has been merged with a firm-level <b>survey,</b> the <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> Business <b>Survey</b> (SBS). The SBS provides information on financial variables such as firm-level added value and gross operating surplus per hour. The coverage of the SBS differs from the SES in that it does not include the whole financial sector (NACE J) but only Other Financial Intermediation (NACE 652) and Activities Auxiliary to Financial Intermediation (NACE 67). The data collection and merger of the SES and SBS datasets has been carried out by Statistics Belgium using firms’ social security numbers.
