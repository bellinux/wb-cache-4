40|$|INTODUCTION: Hydrocephalus {{has been}} related to Chiari type I {{malformation}} (CIM) for a long time. The pathogenesis of this association is complex and still debated. DISCUSSION: A supratentorial hypertensive hydrocephalus may cause CIM, exerting pressure from above. Another pathogenetic hypothesis {{is based on the}} clinical and radiological data from patients affected by complex craniosynostosis, in which this association is more commonly observed as the consequence of a "cephalo-cranial disproportion" ultimately leading to a <b>secondary</b> <b>hydrocephalus.</b> In some cases, the concomitant presence of a stenosis of the jugular foramina would determine a condition of upward venous hypertension, resulting in the development of CIM and an associated hydrocephalus due to cerebellar parenchyma turgor. CONCLUSIONS: The radiological association of ventricular enlargement and hindbrain herniation would be the result of heterogeneous pathogenetic mechanisms which would then require specific therapeutic approaches. In this context, the endoscopic third ventricle-cisternostomy is gaining an increasing interest because of its more physiologic correction of the altered CSF dynamics and its minor interference on the developmental processes responsible for the association of hydrocephalus and CIM...|$|E

A <b>secondary</b> <b>hydrocephalus</b> responded well to shunting. She gradually developed a severe hypokinetic-rigid syndrome 6 months after radiotherapy (54 Gray in 30 daily fractions of 1. 8 Gray). In addition, her vigilance decreased. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed increased signal intensity on T 2 -weighted images in the globus pallidus bilaterally. Nuclear scans indicated only a marginal striatal dopaminergic deficit and revealed decreased metabolism in the thalamus bilaterally. Treatment with dopamine agonists resulted in minor improvement in motor function. Magnetic resonance imaging investigations 3 months later disclosed a decrease of signal intensity changes of the globus pallidus. Gradually, bradykinesia diminished slightly and vigilance increased little. In conclusion, secondary and partially reversible parkinsonism can occur in children after radiotherapy. We suggest that focal encephalopathy resulting from postradiation edema secondary to microangiopathy led to dysfunction of the globus pallidus and thalamus...|$|E
40|$|Hydrocephalus is a {{condition}} characterized by altered cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics and chronic rises in intracranial pressure (ICP). However, the reason why hydrocephalic physiologies fail to inhibit dangerously high ICP levels is not known. Infusion studies are used to raise ICP and evaluate CSF circulation disorders. In this pilot study, ICP signals recorded during infusion tests from 33 patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus and 36 patients having developed a secondary form of normal pressure hydrocephalus were characterized using Permutation Entropy (PE), a symbolic non-linear method to quantify complexity. Each ICP signal was divided into four epochs - baseline (before infusion begins), infusion, plateau, and recovery (after infusion has stopped) - and the mean PE was calculated for each epoch. Statistically {{significant differences were found}} between PE for most epochs (p<; 0. 00833, Bonferroni-corrected Wilcoxon tests), with a significant decrease in the plateau phase. However, differences between PE for normal pressure and <b>secondary</b> <b>hydrocephalus</b> were not significant. Results suggest that the increase in ICP during infusion studies is associated with a significant decrease in PE.

40|$|Ventricular fluid {{concentrations}} of homovanilic acid (HVA) and dopamine (DA) were measured in 20 {{patients with the}} various types of hydrocephalus (seven with congenital hydrocephalus, five with aqueduct obstruction, five with <b>secondary</b> <b>hydrocephalus</b> after subarachnoidal hemorrhage and three with postoperative hydrocephalus of head trauma or a brain tumor. Probenecid loading test was also performed. By estimating changes in HVA, two types of hydrocephalus were differentiated (responder and non-responder). HVA concentrations were high in cases with acute hydrocephalus and responded well to probenecid loading. No response was observed in other types of hydrocephalus. In cases of acute aqueduct obstruction, the preshunting value or HVA was high and did not respond to probenecid loading. This result suggests that there is an active transport system for the acid metabolites, particularly HVA in man, in the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle. When compared with the acute stage of hydrocephalus, ventricular dopamine concentrations were lower in the chronic stage of congenital hydrocephalus, and hydrocephalus secondary to a subarachnoidal hemorrhage or brain tumor. These results show that HVA excretion into the cerebrospinal fluid is lower in such hydrocephalic patients and that in some cases, administration of L-DOPA could be reasonably effective in ameliorating clinical pictures...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Identifying {{marathon}} runners {{at risk of}} neurological deterioration {{at the end of}} {{the race}} (within a large cohort complaining of exhaustion, dehydration, nausea, headache, dizziness, etc.) is challenging. Here we report a case of rehydration-related hyponatraemia with ensuing brain herniation. Case presentation We report the death of runner in his 30 's who collapsed in the recovery area following a marathon. Following rehydration he developed a respiratory arrest in the emergency room. He was found to be hyponatraemic (130 mM). A CT brain scan showed severe hydrocephalus and brain stem herniation. Despite emergency insertion of an extraventricular drain, he was tested for brainstem death the following morning. Funduscopy demonstrated an acute-on-chronic papilledema; CSF spectrophotometry did not reveal any trace of oxyhemoglobin or bilirubin, but ferritin levels were considerably raised (530 ng/mL, upper reference value 12 ng/mL), consistent with a previous bleed. Retrospectively it emerged that the patient had suffered from a thunderclap headache some months earlier. Subsequently he developed morning headaches and nausea. This suggests that he may have suffered from a subarachnoid haemorrhage complicated by <b>secondary</b> <b>hydrocephalus.</b> This would explain why in this case the relatively mild rehydration-related hyponatremia may have caused brain swelling sufficient for herniation. Conclusion Given the frequency of hyponatraemia in marathon runners (serum Na < 135 mM in about 13 %), and the non-specific symptoms, we discuss how a simple screening test such as funduscopy may help to identify those who require urgent neuroimaging. </p...|$|E

40|$|In the neonate, hyperechoic {{thickening}} of the ependyma {{is believed}} to be related to ventriculitis. Yet, in our experience, this sign is much more often observed in association with subacute intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), without infection. Sixty premature neonates were prospectively studied. The observations of transfontanellar sonograms (intracranial hemorrhage, ependymal echogenicity, and ventriculomegaly) were correlated with the results of MRI, lumbar punctures and clinical work-up. Intracranial hemorrhage was detected in 28 patients, and hyperechoic thickening of the ependyma was observed in 21 of them, all of whom had IVH. In 9 of these 21 patients IVH was diagnosed retrospectively thanks to the visualization of the hyperechoic ependyma. In all but one, this sign persisted for at least 2 months after disappearance of other signs of IVH. MRI demonstrated the presence of hemosiderin and ferritin in ependymal or subependymal location only in patients with hyperechoic ependyma. One of our patients had in utero diagnosis of IVH owing to the visualization of the same hyperechoic aspect of the ependyma. Nine of the neonates with hyperechoic ependyma developed ventriculomegaly, and three underwent surgery. Hyperechoic thickening of the ependyma in prematures often results from a subacute IVH. It is related to hemoglobin catabolites which can be detected by MRI. It does not require immediate potentially harmful diagnostic punctures.

40|$|Introduction: Hydrocephalus in {{association}} of posterior cranial fossa tumors (PFT) remains {{a matter of}} controversy; whether to perform cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion prior to tumor resection, or to perform direct tumor resection. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the risks and benefits associated with routine intraoperative insertion of external ventricular drainage (EVD) catheters in patients with PFT presenting with hydrocephalus. Methods: Forty two patients with PFT with <b>secondary</b> <b>hydrocephalus</b> had intraoperative insertion of an external ventricular drainage catheter, it was kept closed, unless intraoperative lowering of the intracranial tension was needed, or opened postoperatively in cases of persistent hydrocephalus, CSF leak, in certain cases throughout and after the procedure. Results: Eight cases (19 %) needed opening of the drainage system during surgery to lower the intracranial tension. In the postoperative period, twelve cases (28. 5 %) needed opening of the EVD for the persistence of hydrocephalus, occurrence of CSF leak or bloody CSF. Only eight cases (19 %) needed permanent CSF shunting, seven of which were ependymomas and medulloblastomas. None of the cases in this series acquired any EVD related infection, nor did those who required subsequent permanent CSF diversion. Conclusion: Intra-operative insertion of EVD catheter during surgery of posterior fossa tumors, as it allows better control of the ICT during surgery if needed, provides a life saving emergency CSF drainage outlet if tumor resection fails to resolve HC or for the occurrence of de novo HC, and finally it provides adequate control of CSF leak in cases with supratentorial ventriculomegaly, where the use of lumbar drains may be hazardous. Intraoperative drainage prevents possible complications met with early CSF diversion.

A prospective evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of intraventricular amikacin was undertaken in neonates with GNM. After the initial intraventricular instillation of 5 mg of amikacin via a Rickham reser-voir, a lO-fold variation in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration and a fivefold variation in half-life of the drug were noted. These variations were related to differences in the CSF volume <b>secondary</b> to <b>hydrocephalus,</b> myelomeningocele, and/or brain ab-scess.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{symptom of the}} {{papillary}} tumor is a headache. Because headaches are so common, most people think nothing of it. This is why brain tumors are so dangerous.

This symptom however occurs <b>secondary</b> to <b>hydrocephalus,</b> which is a result from compression of the cerebral aqueduct. The cerebral aqueduct is a narrow channel in the midbrain, which connects the third and fourth ventricles. When a tumor blocks the pathway of the cerebrospinal fluid, this will cause headaches in the patient. Often when hydrocephalus occurs, a shunt is put in place in order to alleviate the pressure. In one case study, an endoscopic third ventriculostomy was performed as a first line procedure to treat the hydrocephalus and also for diagnostic purposes.|$|R
