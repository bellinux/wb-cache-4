30|$|The {{global climate}} change is feared to promote rapid <b>soil</b> <b>degradations</b> in {{agricultural}} lands worldwide. Soil salinization {{is one of the}} serious <b>soil</b> <b>degradations,</b> which can arise from natural causes and human-mediated activity such as irrigation in arid and semi-arid regions. Approximately 20 % of the irrigated lands in the world are presumably affected by soil salinization (Yeo [1999]). Salinity stress significantly reduces growth and productivity of glycophytes, which are the majority of agricultural products. The term “salinity” represents all the problems of the soil accumulating excessive salts, which can be categorized into sodic (or alkaline) and saline soils (IRRI [2011]). Sodic soils having a poor soil structure generally spread over arid and semi-arid regions, retaining high concentrations of Na+ at the exchangeable site of clay particles in the soil, which shows high pH (greater than 8.5) with a high exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP[*]>[*] 15) (IRRI [2011]). Saline soils can be generally found in arid regions, estuaries, and coastal fringes, which are dominated by Na+ ions with electrical conductivity (EC) more than 4 dS/m that corresponds to approximately 40 [*]mM NaCl (IRRI [2011]; Munns and Tester [2008]). Moreover, saline soils exhibit ESP of[*]<[*] 15 and much lower pH values than the sodic soils (IRRI [2011]).|$|R
