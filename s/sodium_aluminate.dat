Vegetable oil, animal fat, algal and microbial oil are used frequently as feedstocks for biodiesel production. Rapeseed [5], Soybean [6, 7, 8], Sunflower [9, 10, 11], Canola [12], Palm [13] and Coconut [14] oils are the common edible oils for biodiesel synthesis; whereas Castor [15], Mahua [16], Karanja [3, 17] and Jatropha [18] are the major non-edible oils for biodiesel production. More recently, biodiesel production from Sal oil was also reported by Vedaraman et al. [19] using sodium hydroxide as a catalyst. Sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, sodium methoxide, potassium hydroxide and potassium methoxide are the conventional homogeneous catalysts used for biodiesel production. The drawbacks of using these catalysts for biodiesel production are (1) the formation of corrosive environment during transesterification (2) poor recovery of the catalyst, (3) the requirement of additional purification steps to obtain the desired grade of biodiesel, (4) huge amount of effluent generation and (5) the reduction of biodiesel yield due to additional purification steps [14, 20, 21, 22]. To overcome these difficulties, researchers used heterogeneous catalyst which was recycled easily with negligible generation of the effluents. Common heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel synthesis are zeolites [23], alumina-loaded compounds [24], modified dolomites [25], ion-exchange resins [26, 27], potassium fluoride/hydrotalcite [28], calcium oxide [29] magnesium oxide-supported potassium hydroxide [30] and <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminates</b> [31]. In addition to these heterogeneous catalysts, the use of lipase-based enzyme has also been reported for transesterification reaction [32]. A catalyst-free production of biodiesel using supercritical alcohol has also been reported at elevated temperatures and pressures [26]. Moreover, biodiesel production was complicated in the presence free fatty acid (FFA) in oil [20, 22]. In this case, FFA content in oil was first esterified into the fatty acids of methyl ester (FAME) using methanol and sulphuric acid catalyst to reduce FFA content in oil. The reduced FFA oil was purified by removing moisture, sulphuric acid and excess methanol. Now, fatty acid-free tri-glycerides were converted into FAME by the conventional method of transesterification technique. Ghadge and Raheman [20] adopted above two-stage process to produce biodiesel from Mahua oil with high FFA content. Similarly, Naik et al. [22] converted high FFA content Karanja oil to biodiesel by two-stage process. Though the two-stage method can handle high FFA in oil very well, it requires additional processing steps to remove acid catalyst, moisture and alkali which adversely affect the production of biodiesel.|$|R

The interaction of SO 2 with Al 2 O 3 was studied experimentally using B. E. T., thermogravimetry and temperature-programmed desorption. Adsorption takes place through a wide range of binding energies, with some SO 2 adsorbing irreversibly at temperatures below 800 °C. The amount adsorbed depends on the surface history and thermal treatment. An adsorption isotherm based on a bimodal energy distribution provides an adequate description of the equilibrium process. The chemical composition, sulfation and regeneration of an alkali-alumina sorbent for sulfur dioxide were studied using thermogravimetry, gas chromatography, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to provide a}} solution to the problem of toxic metal emissions from high temperature combustion processes. Multi-metal as well as single-metal interactions were investigated to provide an understanding of mechanisms that exist in industrial furnaces, where multiple metals are present. Specifically, multiple toxic metals, lead and cadmium, and a common non-toxic metal, sodium, were investigated. Sodium capture by kaolinite was found to exhibit a negative activation energy (between 1100 and 1300 °C) similar to that shown previously for lead, due to a catastrophic deactivating melt initiated by the metal oxide/kaolinite reaction product. In addition, an overall sodium/kaolinite reaction rate (soluble + insoluble) was determined. It was also discovered that a larger percentage of sodium/kaolinite reaction product was water soluble when formed at lower equivalence ratios than at high equivalence ratios. The majority of the initially formed sodium/kaolinite reaction products were probably insoluble sodium aluminosilicates. However, at high sorbent utilizations (low equivalence ratios), the meta-kaolinite structure probably broke down to form <b>sodium</b> silicates and <b>aluminates,</b> thus enabling at least twice as much sodium capture as the sodium aluminosilicate products. The cadmium/kaolinite reaction rate was highly activated between 1100 °C and 1300 °C, due to a self-enhancing melt, which occurred at the high but not low temperature condition. For the Cd/Pb multi-metal system, cadmium capture was enhanced by a melt initiated by the lead/kaolinite reaction product. Also, cadmium enhanced lead capture by reducing the extent of catastrophic melt caused by the lead/kaolinite product. The formation of an optimum eutectic melt accounts for the enhancement of total bimetal capture by kaolinite at high and low temperatures (1100 °C to 1300 °C). Sodium capture by kaolinite completely dominated over lead capture from a bimetal system. On the other hand, sodium was found to behave similar to lead in terms of enhancing cadmium capture by kaolinite at the low temperature condition.

30|$|Recovery of alumina by {{alkaline}} leaching is less problematic than techniques using acid leaching. US Patent No. 4130627 (1978) describes the {{alkaline leaching}} method {{where in the}} process takes place in an aqueous alkali solution of approximately pH 13, using NaOH, to form an aqueous CFA blend. The blend was agitated on a hotplate at temperatures of about 90  °C, and filtered to recover an alkaline solid. The filtrate was then contacted with hydrochloric or hydrofluoric acid to form soluble salts of various metals. Iron and aluminum were then selectively precipitated and recovered. This process recovered 65  % by weight of Fe and about 89  % of Al. However, this process has some disadvantages, such as being complex, time consuming, requiring larger quantities of processing materials, and high facility costs. This problem {{can be dealt with}} lime-soda sinter process, where a mixture of CFA, calcium carbonate, and sodium carbonate was sintered at high temperature to form a soluble <b>sodium</b> and calcium <b>aluminate</b> (Padil and Sohn 1985). Lu et al. (2003) reported this process where the CFA was mixed with limestone, sintered at 1260  °C, and then dissolved in sodium carbonate solution at 80  °C. This process obtained 99.9  % purity of alumina, and its recovery efficiency was 70  %. Recently, Bai et al. (2010) also used a lime-soda sintering method for the recovery of aluminum from an alkali desilicated CFA. The final Al extraction efficiency was 90  %. This process extracted Al from nearly 88 %– 92  % at temperatures below 85  °C, while Al was not fully released from the sintered ash when the temperature was greater than 85  °C. US Patent No. 4397822 A (1983) demonstrated an improvement method which added a small amount of sulfur and carbon to the lime-CFA sinter mixture before sintering to lower the optimum sinter temperature. This method recovered almost 90  % of alumina from CFA, and the results indicate that the addition of a combination of S and C, either elementally or as coal refuse, produces a higher recovery of alumina from CFA and at lower sintering temperatures, resulting in an energy savings. Recently, two US Patent Nos. 0119426 A 1 (2010) and 7871583 B 2 (2011) released a method for the recovery of alumina from high Si containing CFA, where CFA is leached with highly concentrated NaOH (> 40  %). Silica is first removed from the CFA in the form of Na 2 SiO 3, followed by separation of the residues having Al:Si ≥  2. Subsequently the product was calcinated at 900 – 1100  °C to get pure alumina.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} has been to {{evaluate}} and understand the effect of caustic alkali solution of varying composition on the behaviour of expansive soil containing mixed layered minerals. Mixed layered minerals are formed {{of two or more}} kinds of inter grown layers, not physical mixtures. Illite - smectite is the most abundant and wide spread of the mixed layered clay minerals in sedimentary rocks and soils and also more common than either discrete illite or smectite. In geotechnical engineering much attention has not been paid to the behaviour of soils containing mixed layered minerals. Much less is known about the behaviour of these soils in polluted environment. Mixed layered minerals are more susceptible to environmental changes as the structural linkages between the layer minerals are weak compared to normal layered phyllosilicates. One important pollutant that can have considerable effect on the behaviour of soils is the caustic alkali contamination released from various industries. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} behaviour of even stable minerals is affected by alkali contamination. However, the effect of caustic alkali contamination on the behaviour of soils containing mixed layered minerals is not known and has been chosen for detailed study. Also to understand the mechanism of their interaction with alkali, it is necessary to study the effect of alkali solutions on the constituent clay minerals viz., montmorillonite and illite under similar conditions. To elucidate the mechanism of soil alkali interaction limited tests were conducted with simple electrolyte solution, as the alkali solution also acts as electrolyte apart from being alkaline. To confirm the mechanism of interaction, tests are also conducted on these soils with industrial spent liquor containing high caustic alkali and suspended alumina obtained from an alumina extraction plant treating bauxite with high alkali solutions at high temperatures. The results obtained in the laboratory are compared with the soil samples contaminated with leaking industrial Bayer's liquid in the field. Studies are also conducted to suggest remedial measures to control the adverse effects of alkali solutions on soil containing mixed layer minerals. The content of the thesis is broadly divide into 8 Chapters - viz., Introduction, Background and overview, Experimental program and procedures, Behaviour of soils containing mixed layer mineral illite - smectite (BCSI), Behaviour of montmorillonite and illite, Influence of Bayer's liquor and study on the field contaminated soils, Measures to control the influence of alkali contamination on BCSI and Summary and conclusions. The broad outline of these chapters is given in Chapter 1. A review of literature on the behaviour of soils containing different types of clay minerals with emphasis on mixed layer minerals has been presented in Chapter 2. The influence of different inorganic contaminants on the properties of soils in terms of their physical and chemical characteristics as well as their concentration has been summarized. The importance of changes in surface characteristics of soil particles and the changes in the thickness of diffuse double layer in altering the property of soils at low concentration of contaminants and changes in the mineralogy with high concentrated contaminants such as acids and alkalis has been highlighted. This forms the background information necessary to bring out the scope of the study. Four soils having different mineralogy have been used in this study. These soils are, black cotton soil containing predominantly mixed layer mineral illite - smectite mineral called rectorite, illite, montmorillonite (common smectite) and black cotton soil containing predominantly montmorillonite. The properties of the soils used are described in Chapter 3. Caustic alkali solutions of 1 N, 4 N concentration prepared in the laboratory and industrial alkali-spent liquor are used as contaminants. The spent Bayer's liquor had about 4 N alkali concentration and 10 % alumina in suspension. To simulate the effect of suspended alumina, two more caustic alkali solutions of 1 N and 4 N solutions containing 10 % alumina by weight of solutions are also prepared. To isolate the effect of electrolyte solutions from that of alkali solution, two electrolyte solutions of 1 N and 4 N sodium chloride solutions are also used. Test procedures for conducting various tests such as pH, water adsorption characteristics, X-ray diffraction studies, SEM studies, thermal characteristics and geotechnical properties such as Atterberg limits, Oedometer tests and Shear Strength are given in this chapter. The test procedures are modified, wherever necessary, to bring out the effect of contaminants, particularly the effect of duration of interaction on the properties of soils. The source and properties of black cotton soil are presented in Chapter 4. Detailed x-diffraction studies have confirmed the presence of inter layered illite-smectite mineral viz., rectorite, which is uncommon in Indian expansive soils, and is classified as CH (Clay of high compressibility) as per ASTM soil classification. Effect of alkali and salt solutions of 1 N and 4 N concentration on all physico chemical and geotechnical properties are studied in this chapter. As it is known that presence of certain elements such as aluminium influence the soil alkali interaction, the effect of suspended alumina along with alkali solution has also been investigated. The effect of contaminating fluids such as 1 N NaOH, 4 N NaOH with and without alumina, 1 N NaCl and 4 N NaCl on the geotechnical properties of the soil has been studied. Mineralogical changes were observed by XRD and thermal studies in the soil treated with 4 N NaOH solution and 4 N NaOH + 10 % alumina. The interlayer potassium of illite is released and potassium hydroxide is formed in soil treated with 4 N NaOH. Swelling compounds such as sodium aluminium silicate hydroxide hydrate (SASH) has formed due to attack of 4 N NaOH + 10 % alumina on silica rather than on rectorite. Thus the studies clearly bring out that the rectorite present in the soil is dissociated only in the presence of strong alkali solutions of concentration of about 4 N. The liquid limit of soil decreased with increase in the electrolyte concentration in the case of NaCl solutions. With 1 N NaOH, the liquid limit of soil increased due to increase in the thickness of diffuse double layer due to increased pH. However, Proctor's maximum dry density increased and optimum moisture content decreased with 1 N NaOH. With increase in the concentration of alkali solution to 4 N, the rectorite dissociates into constituent minerals with the formation potassium hydroxide. The liquid limit of soil decreased probably due to the dominating influence of electrolyte nature of hydroxide solution over the effect of increased negative charge on clay particles due increase in the pH on the constituent minerals. Proctor's maximum dry density decreased and optimum moisture content increased with 4 N NaOH. Sediment volume and oedometer free swell at seating/nominal surcharge load of 6. 25 kPa of soil increased in 1 N and 4 N caustic alkali solutions, though by different mechanisms. The increase with 1 N solution is essentially due to increased negative charges on clay mineral surface. However, the increase in swelling with 4 N solution is associated with the dissociation of rectorite mineral and occurs in two distinct phases unlike in the case of 1 N solution. While the first phase can be attributed to the effect of alkaline nature of the solution after reduction in its concentration due to reaction with rectorite and the consequent reduction in its electrolyte nature. The second phase is due to the swelling of the separated constituent minerals in the presence of excess of alkali and occurs after much delay. Consolidation behaviour of rectorite in 1 N and 4 N alkali solutions has been studied in two ways: 1). Loading without waiting for the second stage of swelling to occur, as in standard consolidation procedure and 2). Loading after completion of second stage of swelling which is occurring after considerable delay as explained earlier. Normally one would initiate loading after equilibrium is reached at the end of first stage of swelling and second stage of swelling is not suspected. As there is no second stage of swelling with 1 N solutions, these two types of consolidation tests produced the same results. Abnormal rebound is observed during unloading with 4 N solution in which loading cycle is initiated without waiting for second stage of swelling to complete. It is interesting to note that while the liquid limit of soil decreased with increase in the concentration of alkali solution, the swelling increased. The testing procedure and period of interaction as well as the concentration of alkali solution during the test in these two tests are different. The effects of alkali solution are more severe in case of liquid limit because of thorough mixing and consequent effective reaction during testing. Similarly, the volume changes in soil that has already reacted with 4 N alkali solution when exposed to further to alkali contamination are considerably less compared to uncontaminated soil exposed to fresh contamination. The shear strength of soil treated with 4 N-alkali solution has increased particularly after long period of interaction. This indicates that the soil after mineralogical changes posses good strength. Chapter 5 presents the effect of alkali and salt solutions on the physico chemical and geotechnical properties of component minerals of mixed layered illite/smectite. For this study, commercially obtained montmorillonite (bentonite), naturally occurring black soil containing montmorillonite and commercially pure illite are used. It was observed that montmorillonite alkali reactions would not produce significant mineralogical changes where as illite is dissociated into smectite with the formation of potassium silicate by the interaction of released potassium with soluble silica. This confirms that the ultimate products of rectorite with alkali solutions would be smectite and compounds of potassium. In the absence of mineralogical alterations the liquid limit of montmorillonite decreases due to suppression of diffuse double layer thickness due to dominating influence of alkali solutions on this highly active clay. However a small increase in liquid limit is observed in illite with alkali solutions. Thus the net effect of alkali on rectorite is to decrease the liquid limit with increase in alkali concentration. While the free swell and oedometer swelling of montmorillonite generally decreases with increase in the alkali concentration, they increase in illite. However, in both the minerals the swelling occurs only in one phase. Thus the second phase of swelling that has been observed in rectorite can be attributed to delayed swelling of montmorillonite that has been released by the attack of alkali on rectorite. The behaviour of black soil containing mixed layer mineral contaminated in the field and laboratory by leaking Bayer's spent liquor in an alumina extraction plant has been studied in Chapter 6. The Atterberg limits of the samples treated with liquor are reduced and sediment volume increased. Similarly the swelling at seating load in consolidation test is higher in sample compacted with water and inundated with liquor. X-ray diffraction studies showed that the mineralogical changes are similar to those occurred with 4 N caustic alkali solution. The mineralogical and micro structural changes in the soil samples that are contaminated by leaked spent liquor in the field are relatively more marked. Also the behavior of highly montmorillonite clay, bentonite, has been studied contaminated with liquor in the laboratory. The study on the effect of high concentrated alkali solutions on montmorillonite can be useful to study the effect of interaction on the dissociated montmorillonite. These studies are helpful to suggest some possible remedial measures to control the adverse effect of alkali on soils. Possible Remedial schemes that can be adopted before and after contamination of the soil to control the adverse effect of alkali solutions on the black cotton soil containing mixed layered mineral are listed and their effectiveness examined in Chapter 7. The suggested remedial measures include flushing with water to dilute the effect of alkali, neutralisation with dilute hydrochloric acid, stabilisation of soil with lime and calcium chloride and use of impervious membrane to separate the foundation soil from alkali solution. The effectiveness of different measures as well as the method of their application has been described. Efforts are made to understand the mechanism of remedial action. Consolidation tests conducted on soil contaminated with 4 N alkali solution and inundated with water showed increased swelling due to dilution of the alkali concentration. Though the swelling of contaminated soil can be controlled by passing dilute hydrochloric acid (1 N), the method is not advocated as it can lead to ground water contamination. Mixing the soil with solutions containing up to 5 % by weight of calcium compound in water could not prevent the alkali induced heave in the long run when inundated with 4 N alkali solution. This was due to dissolution of silica by the strong alkali solutions and formation of swelling compounds such as sodium aluminium silicate hydroxide hydrate (SASH). The formation of <b>sodium</b> <b>aluminates</b> occurred only when the alkali solution contained alumina or soil contained calcium compounds. There are no significant variations in the effects of calcium chloride or calcium hydroxide on contaminated soil. Replacing the foundation soil with soil thoroughly contaminated with 4 N alkali solutions and controlling the migration of contaminants into the foundation soil using high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geosynthetic membranes can be an effective measure to control the heaving in alkali contaminated foundation soil containing interstratified illite – smectite.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{experimental work}} on thin films of different compounds containing lithium, sodium or potassium has been synthesized by {{atomic layer deposition}} (ALD). The overall motivation for this work has been to develop materials and methods to improve lithium ion battery technology by using ALD. A cathode in a lithium ion battery should have a long operating life, be environmentally benign and have high capacity and power density. Vanadium oxides are popular as cathodes in lithium ion batteries due to their relative low price and potentially high capacity. Most studies of vanadium oxide cathodes shows relatively short lifetime of the cathode or relatively fast cathodes. In this work a high power thin film cathode of V 2 O 5 for lithium ion batteries has been developed. The cathode is deposited by ALD using VO(thd) 2 and ozone, which displays a rather peculiar type of ALD-growth. This peculiar growth is studied in detail, and the optical properties of these films are investigated. The films have an unusually rough surface, and {{it was found that}} a 10 nm thick film deposited at 235 ºC consisted of individual nano particles. The 10 nm thick cathode has been shown to endure more than 4000 dischargecycles at 120 C and almost 1600 cycles while staying within 80 % of the original capacity. The same cathode was also shown to sustain discharge rates of 960 C which corresponds to a discharge in 3. 75 s. The power density obtained in this work bridges the gap between super capacitors and batteries and the combination of long lifetime and high discharge rate is not found previously for thin film batteries of V 2 O 5. ALD of lithium containing materials has attracted widespread interest the last few years. The number of known precursors for lithium has grown, but the complete picture is still not understood. Therefore lithium hexamethyldisilazane (LiHMDS) is explored as a precursor for ALD of lithium compounds. The precursor is shown successful in deposition of Li 3 N, Li 2 CO 3 and LiNbO 3. The deposition of Li 3 N may be an important step to deposit solid electrolytes and the deposition of Li 2 CO 3 proved to be important for proving the growth of oxides using this precursor. When comparing the growth of Li 3 N and Li 2 CO 3 it was found significant difference in the surface chemistry. The LiNbO 3 -films were shown to be ferroelectric with an unusually high coercive field. It proved possible to deposit epitaxial LiNbO 3 on single crystal substrates of LaAlO 3 and Al 2 O 3 and the orientation of the films could be controlled by the orientation of the substrate. A milestone in atomic layer deposition of lithium compounds would be to deposit a full battery. In order to realize this, a lithiated cathode material must be deposited. The cathode material LiMn 2 O 4 was also studied in this work. It was discovered that the amount of lithium in the deposited films is more or less independent of the number lithium cycles to manganese cycles. It is hypothesized that the ligand of the lithium precursor reduces the manganese and the lithium is intercalated into the manganese oxide. This is a new approach to ALD of lithium compounds and the term film body controlled lithium deposition is used to describe the mechanism. The use of LiHMDS is also attempted in deposition of LiMn 2 O 4, with no success. Sodium and potassium are among the few elements in the periodic table which are not yet used in ALD. Sodium and potassium are relatively similar to lithium and exploring the deposition of these elements will hopefully shed new light on the deposition of lithium compounds. Many oxides of sodium and potassium also have piezo- and ferroelectric properties, and the sodium ion battery is predicted to be a way to combat lithium shortage. Atomic layer deposition of sodium and potassium oxides is reported {{for the first time in}} this thesis. Six different precursors are investigated and evaluated and precursors for sodium and potassium. The initial study was performed by depositing <b>sodium</b> and potassium <b>aluminates,</b> in order to evaluate the precursors. The process for the aluminates was found to scale up to the 200 mm wafer scale. The precursors were found to work in a large temperature window and react with both water and ozone, thus proving to relatively flexible and possible to combine with most known ALD-processes. Further development into deposition of sodium based ferroelectrics then explored by deposition of sodium tantalate and sodium niobate...|$|R
