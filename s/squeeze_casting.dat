40|$|A 380 alloy with a {{relatively}} thick cross-section of 25 mm was <b>squeeze</b> <b>cast</b> using a hydraulic press with an applied pressure of 90 MPa. Microstructure and tensile properties of the <b>squeeze</b> <b>cast</b> A 380 were characterized and evaluated {{in comparison with the}} die cast counterpart. Results show that the <b>squeeze</b> <b>cast</b> A 380 possesses a porosity level much lower than the die cast alloy, which is disclosed by both optical microscopy and the density measurement technique. The results of tensile testing indicate the improved tensile properties, specifically ultimate tensile strength (UTS: 215. 9 MPa) and elongation (Ef: 5. 4 %), for the <b>squeeze</b> <b>cast</b> samples over those of the conventional high-pressure die cast part (UTS: 173. 7 MPa, Ef: 1. 0 %). The analysis of tensile behavior shows that the <b>squeeze</b> <b>cast</b> A 380 exhibits a high tensile toughness (8. 5 MJ·m- 3) and resilience (179. 3 kJ·m- 3) compared with the die cast alloy (toughness: 1. 4 MJ·m- 3, resilience: 140. 6 kJ·m- 3), despite that, during the onset of plastic deformation, the strain-hardening rate of the die cast specimen is higher than that of the <b>squeeze</b> <b>cast</b> specimens. The microstructure analyzed by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows that both the <b>squeeze</b> and die <b>cast</b> specimens contain the primary α-Al, Al 2 Cu, Al 5 FeSi phase and the eutectic Si phase. But, the Al 2 Cu phase present in the <b>squeeze</b> <b>cast</b> alloy is relatively large in size and quantity.

40|$|Rectangular {{cross-section}} specimens {{with different}} section thicknesses {{were prepared to}} study the influences of pouring temperature, mould temperature and squeeze velocity on the fluidity of <b>squeeze</b> <b>cast</b> AZ 91 D magnesium alloy by means of orthogonal test design method. The results show that pouring temperature, mould temperature and squeeze velocity can significantly affect the fluidity of magnesium alloy specimens with wall thickness no more than 4 mm, and the pouring temperature is the most influential factor on the fluidity of specimens with wall thickness of 1, 2 and 3 mm, while mould temperature is the one for specimens with wall thickness of 4 mm. Increasing pouring temperature between 700 °C and 750 °C is beneficial to the fluidity of AZ 91 D magnesium alloy, and increasing mould temperature significantly enhances the filling ability of thick (3 and 4 mm) section castings. The fluidity of <b>squeeze</b> <b>cast</b> magnesium alloy increases {{with the increase of}} wall thickness. It is not recommended to produce magnesium alloy casting with wall thickness of smaller than 3 mm by <b>squeeze</b> <b>cast</b> process due to the poor fluidity.

In this paper, novel aluminum borate whisker (ABOw) and MWNTs hybrid composites were prepared by <b>squeeze</b> <b>cast</b> technique and the properties were investigated. The results show that hybrid preforms may be made by co-deposition of ABOw and MWNTs in a solution by wet method. MWNTs separate the ABOw from whisker-to-whisker contact and decrease the compressive deformation of the hybrid preforms during <b>squeeze</b> <b>cast</b> processing.

50|$|One of the {{greatest}} drawbacks that inventors of <b>squeeze</b> <b>casting</b> have encountered is the configuration of reentrant cavities and internal passages that use the core. One of the possible solutions brought up was creating a core from conventional sand coring. Although this method seemed like a valid solution, the high temperatures from molten metal easily penetrated the core made from sand. Along the way, other inventors have also come up with different methods such as using traditional salt cores, but like sand coring, they are equally, if not more susceptible to stress and cracking.|$|E
50|$|A gradual {{technological}} development {{has taken place}} in ceramic armour: ceramic tiles, in themselves vulnerable to low energy impacts, were first reinforced by glueing them to a backplate; in the nineties their resistance was increased by bringing them under compression on two axes; in the final phase a third compression axis was added to optimise impact resistance. To confine the ceramic core several advanced techniques are used, supplementing the traditional machining and welding, including sintering the suspension material around the core; <b>squeeze</b> <b>casting</b> of molten metal around the core and spraying the molten metal onto the ceramic tile.|$|E
50|$|After {{getting through}} these challenges, the real {{benefits}} of this processes were discovered. <b>Squeeze</b> <b>casting</b> allows for the addition of an insulating layer around the metal core. This results in a layer that prevents the die cavity's heat from melting the core that is being produced. With the insulating layer intact, the construction of this core allows it to be more easily extracted all while leaving behind the protective-insulating layer. Moreover, through this process, a low cost option of producing squeeze cores that is able to withstand high pressures has been made open to the public.|$|E
40|$|An {{indirect}} method {{for the evaluation}} of cooling rate of a <b>squeeze</b> <b>cast</b> aluminum alloy is proposed. Cooling rate is inferred by simple local mechanical tests such as microhardness or indentation. A predictive model is used to correlate cooling rate and mechanical properties. An aluminum alloy (EN-AB 46000) was <b>squeeze</b> <b>cast.</b> Four cylindrical samples were fabricated at different values of the squeezing pressure (from 0 to 100  MPa). Samples were cut longitudinally at the middle height and microhardness was measured along the sample radius as well as dendrite size. Moreover yielding stress was evaluated by means of FIMEC test in the centre of the sample section. Mechanical properties can be related to dendrite size and used for cooling rate inference. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The shrinkage porosity distribution in the castings and the mechanical properties of the castings were also researched. The experimental and simulated results show that increasing squeeze force, or enhancing mold temperature,cannot reduce the shrinkage porosities in the castings.

40|$|The {{effect of}} Si on Fe-rich {{intermetallics}} formation and mechanical properties of heat-treated <b>squeeze</b> <b>cast</b> Al- 5. 0 Cu- 0. 6 Mn- 0. 7 Fe alloy was investigated. Our {{results show that}} increasing Si content promotes the formation of Al 15 (FeMn) 3 (SiCu) 2 (α-Fe), and varying the morphology of T (Al 20 Cu 3 Mn 2) where the size decreases and the amount increases. The major reason is that Si promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the intermetallics leading to finer precipitates. Si addition significantly enhances ultimate tensile strength and yield strength of the alloys. The strengthening effect is mainly owing to the dispersoid strengthening by increasing volume fraction of T phase and less harmful α-Fe with a compact structure, which make the cracks more difficult to initiate and propagation during tensile test.
