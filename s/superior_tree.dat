In {{order to get}} excellent seedlings and stands with good genes and develop Phoebe hui better, {{it is necessary to}} select superior trees. The dominant trees comparative method and small sample plot method were used to evaluate and select Phoebe hui superior trees in Longshan county, Hunan province, and the evaluation factors included diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, timber volume and other quality factors. The results showed that, using the dominant trees comparative method, the DBH, tree height and timber volume values of the <b>superior</b> <b>tree</b> were more than 1. 12, 1. 06 and 1. 23 times of the mean values of 5 dominant trees respectively, and 6 superior trees were selected in two stands. Using small sample plot method, the DBH, tree height and timber volume of the <b>superior</b> <b>tree</b> were more than the mean value and 1 times standard deviation value of the stand, and 4 trees were selected as <b>superior</b> <b>tree.</b> These 2 methods can be used for <b>superior</b> <b>tree</b> selection of Phoebe hui in Hunan, and the dominant trees comparative method is more simple and easier for operation...|$|E

We examined the effect of seed and seedling predation on the seedling recruitment of three tree species, Acer rubrum (red maple), Liriodendron tulipifera (yellow poplar), and Quercus rubra (northern red oak), over three years by manipulating seed and seedling exposure to predators under contrasting microsite conditions of shrub cover, leaf litter, and overstory canopy. Species rankings of seedling emergence were constant across microsites, regardless of exposure to seed predators, but varied across years. A. rubrum had the highest emergence probabilities across microsites in 1997, but Q. rubra had the highest emergence probabilities in 1999. Predators decreased seedling survival uniformly across species, but did not affect relative growth rates (RGRs). Q. rubra had the highest seedling survivorship across microsites, while L. tulipifera had the highest RGRs. Our results suggest that annual variability in recruitment success contributes more to seedling diversity than differential predation across microsites. We synthesized our results from separate seedling emergence and survival experiments to project seedling bank composition. With equal fecundity assumed across species, Q. rubra dominated the seedling bank, capturing 90 % of the regeneration sites on average, followed by A. rubrum (8 % of sites) and L. tulipifera (2 % of sites).

We assessed whether the distribution of PFCTs fulfills the goal of maintaining a spatially homogenous distribution of such crop trees at the stand level by geospatial analysis. We selected 10 group and row planting stands that were either 14 to 15 or 21 to 22 years old. Tree density in group plantings {{was significantly higher than}} in row plantings. Stand basal area was higher in row planting in younger stands but comparable to group planting in older stands. The proportion of trees with straight stems and monopodial crowns was higher in groups than in rows.

In group plantings, naturally regenerated PFCTs contributed to 43 % of total PFCTs, but to only 19 % in row plantings. Also, the spatial distribution of PFCTs in group plantings was more uniform than in row plantings. Uniform and homogeneous distribution of the PFCTs in group planting stands can facilitate design and conduct of tending operations.

The South African trees were in farmers fields, communal land and natural woodland, at three sites: Acornhoek road, Allandale/Green Valley and Andover/Wits Rural Facility. The Namibian trees were all from farmers fields in three areas: North east, North west and West. The fruits were partitioned into skin and flesh/juice to examine {{the extent of the}} variation found in different components of marula fruits from different trees. Namibian fruits were significantly larger than those from South Africa (26. 7 vs 20. 1 g), due to their greater pulp mass (22. 2 vs 16. 2 g), especially the flesh/juice component. In South African fruits, those from farmers fields were significantly larger in all components (Fruit mass = 23. 6 vs 19. 3 and 18. 0 g in natural woodland and communal land respectively). In Namibia, mean fruit mass did not differ significantly across sites (25. 5 − 27. 0 g). However, within each sample there was highly significant and continuous variation between trees in the pulp (S Africa = 7. 5 − 31. 3 g; Namibia = 8. 3 − 36. 0 g) and flesh/juice mass (S Africa = 2. 2 − 7. 6 g; Namibia = 3. 8 − 22. 6 g), indicating the potential for selection of trees producing superior products. The fruits of the Namibian trees were compared with the fruits from one <b>superior</b> <b>tree</b> (‘Namibian Wonder) with a mean fruit mass of 69. 9 g The percentage frequency distribution of fruit mass from trees in farmers fields in South Africa was skewed, while being bimodal in North east and North west populations from Namibia, suggesting that at these sites farmers are engaged in domestication through truncated selection of the best mother trees.

30|$|The {{results in}} Fig.  4 {{are thought to}} be {{important}} because they demonstrate the possibility of improvement of juvenile wood properties by silvicultural practices. It is assumed that growth traits of plantation trees are affected by the genetic factor of planted trees and the environmental factor of the plantation site. We reported the variation of wood properties among hinoki half-sib families (plus trees selected as trees with various superior traits, e.g., fast growth and trunk straightness) and the effect of diameter growth on wood properties [23]. In the previous study, we did not examine the effect of tree height on wood properties. There may be hinoki plus trees with <b>superior</b> <b>tree</b> height growth in younger age. Based on the results from Fig.  4, these plus trees may have superior juvenile wood properties. In 4 -year-old radiata pine (Pinus radiata) and 8 -year-old slash pine (Pinus elliottii), a larger H/D and greater tree height increased the stiffness of juvenile wood, respectively [33 – 35]. These results in other conifer trees are consistent with Fig.  4. In sugi trees, it was reported that site indexes and local environment of plantations also affected height growth of trees [36, 37]. We studied on a sugi cultivar stand, in which trees of each cultivar were planted in a row from the upper to {{the lower part of the}} slope [10]. Many sugi cultivars planted at the lower part of the slope had a larger tree height and DBH than trees at the upper part of the slope. Therefore, selecting hinoki families with superior height growth and/or selecting plantation sites with larger site indexes may increase tree height in younger age, and improve juvenile wood properties by decreasing MFA. We reported that a positive effect of crown length and a negative effect of the distance from crown base on IAA amounts in cambial-region tissues in sugi cultivars [31]. We reported the possible effects of IAA amounts on MFA [32]. If these results in sugi trees held true in hinoki trees, creating shorter crown length and higher position of crown base by pruning in juvenile trees might decrease IAA amounts in cambial-region tissues, and thus induce smaller MFA. In generally, pruning is believed to be a silvicultural practice for the production of lumbers with smaller number of knots. According to our previous and current studies, pruning may have additional effects on juvenile wood properties. More studies on juvenile hinoki trees should be conducted for a better understanding of juvenile wood properties.|$|E

An understanding of nutrient cycling in plantations is essential to enhance their productivity. Sustainable forest productivity involves the managing of nutrients and genetic factors to maximize yields such that they are increasing or non-declining through the maintenance of soil quality and selection of <b>superior</b> <b>tree</b> species and breeds. Komatiland Forests Limited (KFL), a South African forestry company, initiated a permanent sampling plot (PSP) programme in 1998, where it monitors over 30 foliar and soil parameters, as well as tree growth parameters. This study utilized a subset of the permanent sample plots (PSPs) database to compile a suite of foliar and soil parameters {{that can be used to}} better interpret stand productivity in pine plantations. Data from PSPs of pine species Pinus patula, Pinus elliottii and the hybrid Pinus elliottii x caribaea planted on dolomite, granite and shale were used in the statistical analyses as they were well represented in the dataset. The geological analysis revealed that parent material significantly affects soil organic carbon content; soil exchangeable K, soil Fe, soil Mn and foliar Mn concentrations. Exchangeable K was found to be low across the geologies ranging on average from 0. 08 – 0. 11 cmol/kg. An accumulative effect was found in foliar concentration of Mn across the geologies and species, with average foliar Mn concentrations being as high as 1086 ppm. No statistically significant differences were found at the geological level in soil N, P, exchangeable Ca, Mg & Na, Al, pH or soil texture. Neither were there any significant differences in foliar concentration of N, P, Ca, Mg, Na, Cu, Fe, Zn, B and S at the geological level of analysis. However significant correlations were found between soil cation exchange capacity, soil pH and foliar concentration of Zn, Mn, Mg and Ca. Pinus patula had significantly higher foliar concentrations of N (p< 0. 001), P (p< 0. 001). Mg (p= 0. 001), B (p= 0. 001) and S (p< 0. 001) than the other pine variants under analysis. However when species x geology interaction analysis was used P. patula only had significantly higher foliar concentrations with regard to N (p< 0. 001) and P (p< 0. 001), and lower foliar concentrations of Zn (p< 0. 001) and Na (p= 0. 041) than the other pine variants under analysis. Across the species and geologies, soil acidification resulted in low Ca (0. 15 - 1. 6 cmol/kg) and Mg (0. 1 - 0. 7 cmol/kg) availability. Positive and significant correlations were found between foliar and soil concentrations of N (p= 0. 022), P (p= 0. 030), Mg (p< 0. 001) and Ca (p< 0. 001). Productivity of the hybrid was significantly higher than the other two species (p< 0. 001), while P. elliottii had significantly lower productivity than P. patula (p= 0. 001). Regression models and a principal component analyses revealed that from the dataset of soil and foliar chemical and physical parameters Mg Soil, CEC, N soil, N foliar, P foliar, K foliar, Cu foliar, B foliar, S foliar, C:N soil, Ca:Al soil, N:Ca foliar, N:K foliar, clay and silt are best correlated with stand productivity...|$|E

Furthermore we used genetic fingerprinting to analyse a unique stand of elite oaks in Co. Westmeath and determined that the selected trees were not closely related to each other. The analysis of genetic fingerprints of 16 elite oaks also showed that five of them had an unusual pattern of DNA and one tree {{was identified as a}} rare triploid tree.

40|$|This {{research}} {{project is to}} develop a novel approach that fully utilized the current breeding materials and genetic test information available from the NCSU-Industry Cooperative Tree Improvement Program to identify major genes that are segregating for growth and disease resistance in loblolly pine. If major genes can be identified in the existing breeding population, they can be utilized directly in the conventional loblolly pine breeding program. With the putative genotypes of parents identified, tree breeders can make effective decisions on management of breeding populations and operational deployment of genetically <b>superior</b> <b>trees.</b> Forest productivity will be significantly enhanced if genetically superior genotypes with major genes for economically important traits could be deployed in an operational plantation program. The overall objective of the project is to develop genetic model and analytical methods for major gene detection with progeny test data and accelerate the development of genetically superior loblolly pine. Specifically, there are three main tasks: (1) Develop genetic models for major gene detection and implement statistical methods and develop computer software for screening progeny test data; (2) Confirm major gene segregation with molecular markers; and (3) Develop strategies for using major genes for tree breeding...|$|R
30|$|Genetically <b>superior</b> <b>trees</b> in Z. serrata {{have been}} {{selected}} from the 1990 s, and progeny test sites were also established [2 – 5]. Endo et al. [3] reported that in 4 -year-old Z. serrata trees planted in a progeny test site at Chiba, Japan, narrow-sense heritability estimates of stem diameter and tree height were over 0.4 and 0.3, respectively, suggesting that genetic improvement of growth characteristics is possible for Z. serrata. In addition, {{it is thought that}} wood quality of Z. serrata varies among provenances, cultivars, and individuals [6, 7]. To distinguish among the variations, Z. serrata trees have been treated as several cultivars, such as Aka-keyaki, Ao-keyaki (Hon-keyaki), and Ishi-keyaki [6, 7]. Isamoto [7] reported that basic density was 0.46 – 0.48, 0.61 – 0.65, and 0.53 – 0.57  g/cm 3 for Aka-keyaki, Ao-keyaki, and Zaku-keyaki cultivars, respectively. Recently, we examined stress-wave velocity of stem of eight half-sib families of 20 -year-old Z. serrata trees planted with three different initial spacings [8]. Mean values of stress-wave velocity of stem ranged from 2.71 to 3.08  km/s, and significant differences were found among families [8]. Although the general information about anatomical characteristics is available for Z. serrata wood [1, 9 – 11], information is still limited on the anatomical characteristics of selected trees from tree breeding programs of this species.|$|R
40|$|All {{fruit tree}} {{population}}s {{along with the}} service tree (Sorbus domestica L.) population offer a wealth of diverse genetic material which {{is essential for the}} selection and creation of new cultivars and rootstocks. The main objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the service tree population in Eastern Serbia in order to single out good selections whose fruit can be used fresh or processed in the human diet, as well as genotypes suitable for the development of new cultivars and rootstocks. The service tree population was analyzed for tree age, tree size and major fruit properties (shape, size and soluble solids content). Small-sized, medium to large and large fruits ranging in weight from 7. 5 - 9. 8 g, 10. 3 - 18. 6 g and 21. 7 - 25. 6 g were found in 52. 3 %, 41. 1 % and 6. 60 % trees, respectively, within the test population. Fruit length was 18. 6 - 33. 4 mm, fruit thickness 22. 8 - 37. 4 mm, stalk length 1. 8 - 3. 7 mm, soluble solids content 15. 7 - 22. 5 %. The study also presents properties of some <b>superior</b> <b>trees</b> which require greater attention in terms of propagation, collection activities and commercial cultivation.

40|$|The World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) {{has been}} working in the African Humid Tropics (AHT) since 1987. Despite its natural wealth, {{small-scale}} farmers of AHT are among the poorest people in the world and have relied on extractive harvesting of forest products and traditional shifting cultivation for their food and other needs. After years of severe deforestation, alternatives now have to be found as land pressure has increased and commodity prices of cash crops have declined. To overcome these problems, the Participatory Domestication of high-value indigenous fruit, nut and medicinal trees is seen as one way of empowering rural households to improve their own situation. Many products of indigenous trees have existing local and regional markets, with additional potential niches in international commerce. In Participatory Domestication, villagers are helped to develop local nurseries, taught skills of vegetative propagation, and assisted with the technical implementation of selecting <b>superior</b> <b>trees</b> for cultivar development, that meet specific market-oriented ‘ideotypes’. Farmers are enthusiastically adopting these techniques and are thereby improving their own livelihoods. The most successful community is expecting to make $US 10, 000 in 2005 from the sale of improved cultivars from its nursery. The AHT tree domestication programme started in two villages in 1998, now 42 villages in two Provinces of Cameroon are active partners, and the programme has been extended to other countries.
