40|$|Local heat {{transfer}} coefficients {{have been obtained}} through measuring the temperature distribution along the separating, reattaching, and redeveloping regions of axisymmetric turbulent boundary layers {{on the wall of}} cylinders with constant heat flux. Measurements have been made with different configuration of three cylinders and five ellipsoidal steps on the leading face. The velocity of the turbulent flow was changed stepwise from 5 to 30 m/s. The range of Reynolds number, based on either the step height or diameter of convex curvature, is between 4, 000 and 100, 000. In addition, a surface-streamline flow visualization technique was tried to identify the reattachment loci, as well as the axisymmetry of the temperature distribution. It was found that the points of maximum {{heat transfer}} and reattachment are coincident within an uncertainty of ± 0. 5 inch. As a common feature, the rate of heat transfer undergoes a drop within a short length distance right after separation, followed by a rise leading to a sharp maximum at the reattachment neighborhood. The study demonstrates that the maximum Nusselt number and heat transfer rate increase with either decreasing cylinder radius, or increasing <b>step</b> <b>diameter.</b> The effect of step height {{is similar to that of}} the <b>step</b> <b>diameter.</b> An empirical equation, correlated as a function of Reynolds number and aspect ratio of cylinder-step diameters, is proposed for the maximum Nusselt number...|$|E

Step decrease and <b>step</b> increase of <b>diameter,</b> branch points, and gradual taper or flare of diameter were studied. Results showed increase of both velocity and peak height as the action potential approaches a point of step decrease. A step increase causes decrease of both velocity and peak height with approach; propagation may either fail, succeed with brief delay, or, with longer delay, succeed in both forward and reverse directions. With branching, both the shape and the dimensionless velocity, TO/A, remain un-changed when the d 312 values are matched. Without such matching, the changes of shape and dimensionless velocity of an action potential correspond to those found for step decrease or <b>step</b> increase of <b>diameter.</b> For regions of flare or taper, it was found (for a specific previously defined class) that velocity changed in proportion with the changing length constant.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the failure analysis of carbon steel roller shaft of continuous pad steam machine used in textile industry. The fracture position was located at a <b>stepped</b> <b>diameter.</b> The failed component was the shaft made of carbon steel AISI 1040. Standard procedure for failure analysis was employed in this investigation. Visual examination, chemical analysis, hardness and tensile strength measurements, microstructural characterization, fractography analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) {{were used for}} the failure analysis. Using this failure analysis approach, we pinpointed the root cause of failure and developed a means of solving this type of failure in the future. Firstly, the chemical composition of the shaft is done by an Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) method, the found chemical composition was matching with required standard value. Mechanical testing consists of two test i. e. tensile test and hardness test and it was found out that the strength and hardness of specimens were within the required capacity. For metallurgical analysis, the microstructure of the shaft was developed by using an optical microstructure. Equal distribution of ferrite perlite shows that heat treatment was performed well and carbon percentage in a material is satisfying the standard values. Thus, it proves that the material used was of good quality and indicates that failure is not due to material property. Further for the fractography, the fractured surface was examined by SEM. The cross-section was taken in a quarter segments and divided into four regions i. e. A, B, C, and D. Fractography morphology mainly showed that the failure of roller shaft was caused due to fatigue. To examine the stress distribution at the fractured surface the Finite Element Method (FEM) was also carried out. Based on the shaft size, a precise ANSYS model was developed. The result of FEM shows that stress concentration was significant at roller shaft step which could reduce the material reliability to some extent. Based on the failure analysis it could be concluded that due to stress concentration a micro crack is initiated along the weak interface and further it converted into the major fatigue failure. Fractography morphology of failed roller shaft also confirms the fatigue failure...|$|R

Traverse hardening is used extensively {{in the production of}} shaft type components such as axle shafts, excavator bucket pins, steering components, power tool shafts and drive shafts.
