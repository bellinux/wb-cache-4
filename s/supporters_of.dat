Harold Lalor, a Jesuit priest and leading confidant of Santamaria, had studied with Thục in Rome. During the trip, Diệm met with Gilroy, the first Australian cardinal, as well as Santamaria and Archbishop of Melbourne Daniel Mannix, both of whom praised him strongly.

5|$|The English Civil War {{broke out}} in 1642 between the Royalist <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> Charles I and the <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> Parliament. The fortifications in North Wales were held by <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> the king {{and in some cases}} became {{strategically}} important as part of the communications route between royal forces operating in England and supplies and reinforcements in Ireland. The castles and towns' defences were repaired at considerable expense and brought back into service, garrisoned by local Royalists. Parliament gained the upper hand in England, however, and by 1646 its armies were able to intervene in North Wales. Caernarfon, Beaumaris and Conwy were taken that year.

5|$|Although the Boleyn {{family still}} held {{important}} {{positions on the}} Privy Council, Anne had many enemies, including the Duke of Suffolk. Even her own uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, had come to resent her attitude to her power. The Boleyns preferred France over the Emperor as a potential ally, but the King's favour had swung towards the latter (partly because of Cromwell), damaging the family's influence. Also opposed to Anne were <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> reconciliation with Princess Mary (among them the former <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> Catherine), who had reached maturity.
