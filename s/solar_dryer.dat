40|$|Drying for {{agricultural}} and marine products {{are one of}} the most attractive and cost-effective application of solar energy. Numerous types of <b>solar</b> <b>dryers</b> have been designed and developed in various parts of the world, yielding varying degrees of technical performance. Basically, there are four types of solar dryers; (1) direct <b>solar</b> <b>dryers,</b> (2) indirect <b>solar</b> <b>dryers,</b> (3) mixed-mode dryers and (4) hybrid <b>solar</b> <b>dryers.</b> This paper is a review of these types of <b>solar</b> <b>dryers</b> with aspect to the product being dried, technical and economical aspects. The technical directions in the development of solar-assisted drying systems {{for agricultural}} produce are compact collector design, high efficiency, integrated storage, and long-life drying system. Air-based solar collectors are not the only available systems. Water-based collectors can also be used whereby water to air heat exchanger can be used. The hot air for drying of agricultural produce can be forced to flow in the water to air heat exchanger. The hot water tank acts as heat storage of the solar drying system.

50|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>dryers</b> are {{devices that}} use solar energy to dry substances, {{especially}} food. There are two general types of solar dryers: Direct and indirect.|$|R
40|$|Artificial dryers {{promote a}} {{high-quality}} food drying, {{in spite of}} the considerable energy consumption. <b>Solar</b> <b>dryers</b> use only <b>solar</b> energy to heat the drying airflow; nevertheless, {{it is not possible to}} control the airflow thermal conditions. Hybrid <b>solar</b> <b>dryers</b> arise as an interesting option to reduce the drying costs (compared to the artificial <b>dryer’s</b> costs). Hybrid <b>solar</b> <b>dryers</b> improve the quality of the final product due to the control of the thermal drying condition. This paper presents an experimental analysis of an innovative hybrid solar-electrical dryer. This dryer consists of two chambers: solar chamber and drying chamber with electrical air heater. An experimental evaluation of the airflow in the device was performed and the average values of the temperature and the mass flow were presented as a function of the ambient conditions. To determine the performance of the proposed dryer, banana slices were dried in the device and the results were compared with natural sun drying and artificial drying...|$|R
5000|$|Solar food drying {{involves}} the use of a <b>solar</b> <b>dryer</b> designed and built specifically for this purpose. Solar drying is distinctly different from open air [...] "sun drying," [...] which has been used for thousands of years. A good solar food dryer dries food much faster than air drying. It can achieve higher food drying temperature, control airflow and temperature, and keep food protected while drying.|$|E
50|$|Direct solar dryers {{expose the}} {{substance}} to be dehydrated to direct sunlight. Historically, {{food and clothing}} was dried in the sun by using lines, or laying the items on rocks or on top of tents. In Mongolia cheese and meat are still traditionally dried using {{the top of the}} ger (tent) as a <b>solar</b> <b>dryer.</b> In these systems the solar drying is assisted by the movement of the air (wind) that removes the more saturated air away from the items being dried. More recently, complex drying racks and solar tents were constructed as solar dryers.|$|E
50|$|Some solar food dryer designs {{employ a}} {{separate}} solar collector {{to generate the}} heated air, which is then directed into a food chamber or cabinet. This type of solar food dehydrator is called an indirect <b>solar</b> <b>dryer.</b> Other designs combine the collector and food cabinet and allow direct heating of food (these are called direct solar dryers). It is said that the indirect dryers allow much better drying, but the downside is their larger size. Backup electric heating {{can be incorporated into}} some solar food dehydrators to provide an alternative heat source if the weather changes.Solar food dehydrators are often cited as viable tools in the search for agricultural sustainability and food security.|$|E

40|$|The {{unpredictable}} {{rise and}} frequent scarcity of fossil fuel accelerated the continuous {{search for an}} alternative power source. Solar {{is one of the}} renewable and sustainable sources of power that attracted a large community of researchers from all over the world. This is largely due to its abundant in both direct and indirect form. As such the development of efficient and inexpensive equipment for the drying of agricultural and marine products using solar power evolved thereby improving the quality of the products as well as improving the quality of life. <b>Solar</b> <b>dryers</b> are available in a range of size and design and are used for drying various agricultural products.

40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} is to assess effectiveness of continuous <b>solar</b> <b>dryer</b> integrated with desiccant thermal storage for drying cocoa beans. Two type of desiccants were tested, molecular sieve 13 × (Na 86 [(AlO 2) 86 ·(SiO 2) 106]· 264 H 2 O) as an adsorbent type and CaCl 2 as an absorbent type. The results revealed that during sunshine hours, the maximum temperature within the drying chamber varied from 40 °C to 54 °C. In average, it was 9 – 12 °C higher than ambient temperature. These temperatures are very suitable for drying cocoa beans. During off-sunshine hours, humidity of air inside the drying chamber was lower than ambient because of the desiccant thermal storage. Drying times for intermittent directs sun drying, <b>solar</b> <b>dryer</b> integrated with adsorbent, and <b>solar</b> <b>dryer</b> integrated with absorbent were 55 h, 41 h, and 30 h, respectively. Specific energy consumptions for direct sun drying, <b>solar</b> <b>dryer</b> integrated with adsorbent, and <b>solar</b> <b>dryer</b> integrated with absorber were 60. 4 MJ/kg moist, 18. 94 MJ/kg moist, and 13. 29 MJ/kg moist, respectively.

40|$|Solar drying {{is one of}} the {{processes}} that have found application in Algeria, because of the important quantities of solar irradiations that can be exploited in this country. Nevertheless, the experience of Algeria in solar drying is recent and limited to drying of fruits, vegetables, medicinal and aromatic herbs. The effectuated review has given an idea about the existing functional dryers in this country with presentation of their different design aspects and in some cases the mathematical modeling for well describing and predicting their behaviours. The <b>solar</b> <b>dryers</b> were classified into two classes according to their operation mode and without taking into account if the dryers are using auxiliary sources of energy. The two classes are: passive dryers and active dryers. On the other hand, each class was divided into subclasses representing the type. We have found the direct and indirect types for the passive dryers, but only indirect types for the active dryers. Mixed types were not developed. The <b>solar</b> <b>dryers</b> were developed and tested in two different climatic regions which are the north of the country and the Sahara. In the most studied cases, one or multiple auxiliary sources of energy were used in order to increase the performances of the dryer or to decrease drying time. Consequently, we register the utilization of pebbles as a heat storage system, resistances as electrical heater, gas-ring and photovoltaic cells in order to give independency against the use of the traditional electrical energy. In the case of the active dryers, adding fans and temperature and flow controllers has permitted the control of the drying conditions. Depending on the dryers, the dried quantities vary from 200 Â g to 36 Â kg. Comparison between many studied cases for different modes and types and with open sun drying method was furthermore done.
