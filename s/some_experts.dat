5|$|Although {{many species}} have been named, modern paleontologists {{recognize}} only one, T. bataar, as valid. <b>Some</b> <b>experts</b> see this species as an Asian representative of the North American genus Tyrannosaurus; this would make the genus Tarbosaurus redundant. Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, if not synonymous, {{are considered to be}} at least closely related genera. Alioramus, also from Mongolia, is thought by some authorities to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus.|$|E
5|$|At 23:30, Fleet and Lee {{noticed a}} slight haze {{on the horizon}} ahead of them, but did not make {{anything}} of it. <b>Some</b> <b>experts</b> now believe that this haze was actually a mirage caused by cold waters meeting warm air (similar to a water mirage in the desert) when Titanic entered Iceberg Alley.

5|$|At that time, many in Britain {{worried that}} coal {{reserves}} were rapidly dwindling, but <b>some</b> <b>experts</b> opined that improving technology would reduce coal consumption.

5|$|In {{terms of}} social class the average American may be {{referred}} to as being either a member of the middle or working class. The discrepancy is largely the result of differing class models and definitions of what constitutes a member of the middle class. Currently the vast majority of Americans self-identify as middle class, yet <b>some</b> <b>experts</b> in the field such Michael Zweig of Stony Brook University or Dennis Gilbert of Cornell University have brought forth different theories. As most Americans are neither professionals nor managers and lack college degrees the average American may be described as being either or both, lower middle and working class.|$|E
5|$|Like most known tyrannosaurids, Gorgosaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} weighing {{more than}} two metric tons as an adult; dozens of large, sharp teeth lined its jaws, while its two-fingered forelimbs were comparatively small. Gorgosaurus was most closely related to Albertosaurus, and more distantly related to the larger Tyrannosaurus. Gorgosaurus and Albertosaurus are extremely similar, distinguished mainly by subtle differences in the teeth and skull bones. <b>Some</b> <b>experts</b> consider G. libratus to be a species of Albertosaurus; this would make Gorgosaurus a junior synonym of that genus.|$|E

5|$|Although in 2008 Baseball America {{projected}} Venable as an {{every day}} starter for the Padres in 2010, <b>some</b> <b>experts</b> questioned {{whether he would}} be a long-term solution in center field for the team. Venable started the 2009 season with the Padres' Triple-A affiliate, Portland Beavers, but he was recalled by the Padres on June 3. His father, Max, served as the Beavers' hitting coach in 2009. Following the July 5 trade of Scott Hairston to the Oakland Athletics, Venable shared right field with Kyle Blanks. On July 12 against the San Francisco Giants, he had his first home run of the season in his first career four-hit game. Between July 30 and August 5, he homered in five of seven games. In an August 23 game against the St. Louis Cardinals, he was involved in a bench-clearing incident when Albert Pujols thought he threw an elbow while being tagged out. In 2009, he posted 12 home runs and tallied 38 runs batted in (RBI), while defensively 493.2 of his 643 innings were spent in right field and only 117 in center field.|$|E
40|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of urinary incontinence classes is sometimes difficult to establish. As a rule, only {{the results of}} urodynamic testing allow an accurate diagnosis.

Therefore, the aims of this paper are to present the definition of Artificial Intelligence; to explain what expert system and system for decision support are and its application in the field of health and to discuss <b>some</b> <b>expert</b> systems for {{differential diagnosis}} of urinary incontinence. It is concluded that expert systems may be useful not only for teaching purposes, but also as decision support in daily clinical practice.
