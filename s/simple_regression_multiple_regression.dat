One of them is the multifarious industry sector which consists of 7 sub-sectors of open manufacturing companies or manufaktur tbk. The automotive and component sub-sectors consissts of 13 open manufacturing companies or manufaktur tbk. In the last three years the automotive and component sub-sectors have fluctuated in the ROA, ROE, EPS, DER, and stock price so that investors have difficulty determining the decision indicator to invest. This type of research is an explanatory research, with the population that can be studied in the automotive and component sub-sectors with a total of 11 companies. The type of data source that used is the secondary data obtained indirectly. The type of data used in this study are time series data and cross section data or often referred as panel data. Methods of data analysis used are classical assumption, correlation, determination, <b>simple</b> <b>regression,</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>regression,</b> and signification test by using SPSS application.

40|$|Classical {{inferences about}} {{population}} parameters are usually {{drawn from the}} sample data alone. This applies to methods used in parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. Inferences about population parameters could be improved using non-sample prior information (NSPI) {{on the value of}} another related parameter. However, any NSPI on the value of any parameter is likely to be uncertain (or unsure). The NSPI can be classified as (i) unknown (unspecified), (ii) known (specified), and (iii) uncertain if the suspected value is unsure. For the three different scenarios, three different statistical tests: (i) unrestricted test (UT), (ii) restricted test (RT) and (iii) preliminary test test (PTT) are defined. The current research is to test the intercept parameter(s) when NSPI is available on the slope parameter(s). The test statistics, their sampling distributions, and power functions of the tests are derived. Comparison of power functions of the tests are used to recommend a best test. In this thesis, we test (1) the intercept of the simple regression model (SRM) when there is NSPI on the slope, (2) the intercept vector of the multivariate simple regression model (MSRM) when there is NSPI on the slope vector, (3) a subset of regression parameters of the multiple regression model (MRM) when NSPI is available on another subset of the regression parameters, and (4) the equality of the intercepts for p (≥ 2) lines of the parallel regression model (PRM) when there is NSPI on the slopes. For each of the above four regression models, the following steps are carried out: (1) derived the test statistics of the UT, RT and PTT for both known and unknown variance, (2) derived the sampling distributions of the test statistics of the UT, RT and PTT, (3) derived and compared the power function {{and the size of the}} UT, RT and PTT. For known variance, under a sequence of an alternative hypothesis, the sampling distributions of the UT and RT of the simple regression model follows a normal distribution. However, the PTT follows a bivariate normal distribution. For unknown variance, the sampling distribution of the UT and RT of the simple regression model follows a Student’s t distribution but the PTT follows a correlated bivariate Student’s t distribution. For the multivariate <b>simple</b> <b>regression,</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>regression</b> and parallel regression models, the sampling distribution of the UT and RT follows a univariate noncentral F distribution under the alternative hypothesis. However, the PTT follows a correlated bivariate noncentral F distribution. For the four regression models above, there is a correlation between the UT and PT but there is no such correlation between the RT and PT. To evaluate the power function of the PTT the probability integral of the bivariate normal, bivariate Student’s t and bivariate noncentral F distributions are used. For the computations of the power function of the PTT of the MSRM, MRM and PRM require the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of a correlated bivariate noncentral F (BNCF) distribution. But the correlated BNCF distribution is not available in the literature, and hence we derive the probability density function (pdf) and cdf of the BNCF distribution. The R package is used for all computations and graphical analyses. The statistical criteria that are used to compare the performance of the UT, RT and PTT are the size and power of the tests. A test that minimizes the size and maximizes the power is preferred over any other tests. In reality, the size of a test is fixed, and then the choice of the best test is based on its maximum power. The study shows that the power of the RT is always higher than that of the UT and PTT, and the power of the PTT lies between the power of the RT and UT. The size of the UT is smaller than that of the RT and PTT. Among the three tests, the UT has the lowest power and lowest size. In terms of power it is the worst and in terms of size it is the best. The RT has maximum power and size. The PTT has smaller size than the RT and the RT has larger power than the PTT. The PTT protects against maximum size of the RT and minimum power of the UT. Thus the the PTT attains a reasonable dominance over the UT and RT for all regression models when the suspected value of the slope parameter(s) suggested by the NSPI is not too far away from that under the null hypothesis. ...|$|E

30|$|Data are {{expressed}} as means with standard deviation (SD). One-way {{analysis of variance}} was used to test significance between the two groups in the baseline numerical items, in the CRP concentration and body temperature for each time point, and days required until discharge. The chi-square test was used to test differences between the groups for baseline categorical items (sex, history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking habit), incidence of each postoperative complication, and number of patients who had postoperative complications. Correlations between the mean infusion rate of glucose applied during surgery (X) and TP and serum albumin concentrations (Y) were analyzed by Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and relations were fitted by <b>simple</b> <b>regression.</b> <b>Multiple</b> linear <b>regression</b> analysis was performed to estimate the dependence of age, body mass index (BMI), mean infusion rate of glucose (mg/kg/h) and insulin (mU/kg/h) during surgery, operation time, total fluid volume, intraoperative blood loss, and intraoperative blood transfusion on the reduction of TP and albumin concentrations from the control to Day 1 values. P <[*] 0.05 was considered statistically significant.|$|R
5000|$|This {{textbook}} takes {{a learning}} by doing approach, and [...] "covers basic econometric methods (statistics, <b>simple</b> and <b>multiple</b> <b>regression,</b> nonlinear regression, maximum likelihood, and generalized method of moments), and addresses the creative process of model building with due attention to diagnostic testing and model improvement. Its last part is devoted to two major application areas: the econometrics of choice data (logit and probit, multinomial and ordered choice, truncated and censored data, and duration data) and the econometrics of time series data (univariate time series, trends, volatility, vector autoregressions, and a brief discussion of SUR models, panel data, and simultaneous equations)." ...|$|R
