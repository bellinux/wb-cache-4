25|$|The Society of Automotive Engineers, (SAE), Emergency Warning Lights and Devices {{committee}} {{oversees the}} SAE emergency vehicle lighting practices and the siren practice, J1849. This practice was updated through {{cooperation between the}} SAE and NIST, the National Institute of Standards. Though this version remains quite similar to the California Title 13 standard for <b>sound</b> <b>output</b> at various angles, this updated practice enables an acoustic laboratory to test a dual speaker siren system for compliant <b>sound</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
25|$|Multi-speaker {{electronic}} sirens {{often are}} {{alleged to have}} dead spots at certain angles to the vehicle's direction of travel. These are caused by phase differences. The sound coming from the speaker array can phase cancel in some situations. This phase cancellation occurs at single frequencies, based upon the spacing of the speakers. These phase differences also account for increases, based upon the frequency and the speaker spacing. However, sirens are designed to sweep the frequency of their <b>sound</b> <b>output,</b> typically, no less than one octave. This sweeping minimizes the effects of phase cancellation. The end {{result is that the}} average <b>sound</b> <b>output</b> from a dual speaker siren system is 3dB greater than a single speaker system.|$|E
25|$|Some older systems {{featured}} a simple beeper as their only <b>sound</b> <b>output,</b> {{as the original}} ZX Spectrum and IBM PC; despite this, many skilled programmers were able to produce unexpected rich music with this bare hardware, where the sound is fully generated by the system's CPU by direct control of the beeper.|$|E
50|$|The in-game {{motorcycles}} {{resemble the}} team Honda/Castrol Honda RVF750 RC45. In making the game, AM3 consulted the motorcycle racing team Castrol/Honda Racing Corporation, who helped {{them on a}} number of points, including studies on where sound comes from on a motorcycle and how it travels to the ear of the rider. The team determined that they needed four <b>sound</b> <b>outputs</b> to recreate this experience realistically. Because the Model 2 arcade board has only two <b>sound</b> <b>outputs,</b> they used a Model 1 sound board for the additional two <b>sound</b> <b>outputs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{remainder}} of West <b>Sound's</b> <b>output</b> consists of programming from Bauer City 2 network, originating from such stations as Key 2 in Manchester, Clyde 2 in Glasgow, Forth 2 in Edinburgh, Tay 2 in Dundee and Metro Radio in Newcastle.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of Swansea <b>Sound's</b> <b>output</b> is produced and broadcast from its Gowerton studios (shared with The Wave 96.4 FM). The nightly late show and a Sunday afternoon show, Flashback 40, originates from sister AM station Signal 2 in Stoke-on-Trent. A syndicated show from Chris Country Radio also airs on Monday evenings.|$|R
25|$|Many {{companies}} make small solid-state digital audio players, essentially producing flash drives with <b>sound</b> <b>output</b> {{and a simple}} user interface. Examples include the Creative MuVo, Philips GoGear and the first generation iPod shuffle. Some of these players are true USB flash drives as well as music players; others do not support general-purpose data storage. Other applications requiring storage, such as digital voice or sound recording, can also be combined with flash drive functionality.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} speed U {{is that of}} the annular jet. The characteristic dimension D is {{the cavity}} diameter and it appears that both cavities have similar dimensions. Again, the Rossby number V {{is likely to be a}} relevant dynamic number, since the operation of the inner cavity must be similar to that in the police whistle. It is likely that the vortex in the outer cavity is in antiphase with the inner cavity to amplify jet displacement and thus the <b>sound</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rated Power– Nominal (or even continuous) power, and peak (or maximum short-term) power a {{loudspeaker}} can handle (i.e., maximum input power before destroying the loudspeaker; {{it is never}} the <b>sound</b> <b>output</b> the loudspeaker produces). A driver may be damaged at much less than its rated power if driven past its mechanical limits at lower frequencies. Tweeters can also be damaged by amplifier clipping (amplifier circuits produce large amounts of energy at high frequencies in such cases) or by music or sine wave input at high frequencies. Each of these situations might pass more energy to a tweeter than it can survive without damage. In some jurisdictions, power handling has a legal meaning allowing comparisons between loudspeakers under consideration. Elsewhere, the variety of meanings for power handling capacity can be quite confusing.|$|E
5000|$|The Proteus 2000 {{released}} in 1999 was a 1U rack sound module based on Audity 2000 {{released in}} 1998.

It could be expanded with slots for three additional sound ROM cards. A cheaper Proteus 1000 model was also introduced with the same soundset and ROM but only 64 voice polyphony and fewer individual <b>sound</b> <b>outputs.</b>|$|R

25|$|The PSP Go {{features}} 802.11b Wi-Fi {{like its}} predecessors, {{but no longer}} uses a standard USB A-to-Mini-B cable common with many devices. A new proprietary multi-use connector is used for USB connectivity. A suitable USB cable is included with the unit. The new multi-use connector allows for charging and USB similar to previous units, as well as video and <b>sound</b> <b>output</b> with the same connector (using an optional composite or component AV cable), unlike previous offerings which had TV OUT and USB functionality on separate ports. Sony also offers an optional cradle for charging and USB data transfer on the PSP Go, similar to previous offerings. The PSP Go adds support for Bluetooth connectivity, enabling the use of compatible Bluetooth headsets and tethering with Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones. This also enables users to connect and play games using a Sixaxis or DualShock 3 PlayStation 3 controller or Bluetooth Headset.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{previous}} albums, Subterranean Jungle {{shifted the}} band's <b>sound</b> <b>output</b> focus towards {{getting back to}} their punk rock roots, {{rather than trying to}} expand fan-base by releasing more pop-oriented songs. This change is due to guitarist Johnny Ramone obtaining more priority over the style choice. Johnny felt as though the band needed to [...] "be focused and stop worrying about getting played [...] and just make a good record." [...] Since lead singer Joey Ramone was not given as much stylistic freedom, the album lacks the sense of pop-influence which previous releases had contained and instead was shaped mostly by Johnny's hard rock background.|$|E

500|$|The fourth {{generation}} MacBook Pro follows {{the design of}} the previous two generations with an all-metal unibody enclosure and separated black keys. A few apparent design changes are a thinner chassis, thinner screen bezel, larger trackpad, the OLED Touch Bar, and shallower butterfly mechanism keyboard with less key separation than the previous models. The speakers grilles have been relocated to the sides of the keyboard on the 13-inch variant. Tear downs show that the speaker grilles on the 13-inch model with Touch Bar are [...] "largely cosmetic", and that <b>sound</b> <b>output</b> mostly comes through the side vents. The {{fourth generation}} MacBook Pro comes in two finishes, the traditional silver color and a darker [...] "space gray" [...] color. The MacBook Pro model name returns {{to the bottom of the}} screen bezel in Apple's San Francisco font after being absent from the third generation. Similar to the Retina MacBook, the new models replace the backlit Apple logo on the rear of the screen with a glossy opaque version.|$|E
500|$|In February 1977 after {{attending}} a Ramones concert in Los Angeles, music producer Phil Spector offered {{to assist in}} making Rocket to Russia. The band declined his offer, feeling as though the album {{would not be the}} same without Tommy Ramone and Tony Bongiovi producing the album. While the band refused his initial offer, they later asked Spector to help with the album because of their lack of popularity and sales. End of the Century would be the first album released without former drummer and producer Tommy. Spector had become famous through his work with The Ronettes, The Righteous Brothers, Ike and Tina Turner, The Beatles and John Lennon, among others. With these releases, Spector defined what would become known as the [...] "Wall of Sound", which is a dense, layered, and reverberant sound that came across well on AM radio and jukeboxes. These standards are created through instruments performing identical parts in unison, using high-quality overdubbing and echo chambers to aid in the production value. The producer was convinced that the Ramones had talent with lyrics and musical structure, so he intended to promote the band through more advanced methods of <b>sound</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
500|$|Subwoofers {{received}} {{a great deal}} of publicity in 1974 with the movie Earthquake which was released in Sensurround. Initially installed in 17 U.S. theaters, the Cerwin Vega [...] "Sensurround" [...] system used large subwoofers which were driven by racks of 500 watt amplifiers which were triggered by control tones printed on one of the audio tracks on the film. Four of the subwoofers were positioned in front of the audience under (or behind) the film screen and two more were placed together {{at the rear of the}} audience on a platform. Powerful noise energy and loud rumbling in the range of 17Hz to 120Hz was generated at the level of 110–120 decibels of sound pressure level, abbreviated dB(SPL). The new low frequency entertainment method helped the film become a box office success. More Sensurround systems were assembled and installed. By 1976 there were almost 300 Sensurround systems leapfrogging through select theaters. Other films to use the effect include the WW II naval battle epic Midway in 1976 and Rollercoaster in 1977. Deep bass speakers were once an exotic commodity owned by audiophiles. By the mid-1990s, they were much more popular and widely used, [...] with different sizes and capabilities of <b>sound</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E

New experimental information on open turbulent flames and on gas turbine combustor cans is presented. Available information on gas phase diffusion flames is reviewed. It is concluded that if some of the gross turbulence features of the flame are known and if the acoustical behavior of any flame enclosure is known, then scaling rules for behavior of the <b>sound</b> power <b>output</b> and spectral content may be quite accurately produced by theory. On the other hand, the theory is not sufficiently advanced to make absolute predictions; such predictions must await more detailed knowledge of turbulent flame structure...|$|R

500|$|The album's only cover song, [...] "California Sun", was {{originally}} written by Henry Glover and Morris Levy, and performed by The Rivieras. While the lyrics and musical structure {{remain the same}} throughout the piece, Joey's pronunciation upon words significantly lessened the similarity to the original song. The <b>sound</b> <b>output</b> tone also differs from the original, with more distortion {{as well as a}} faster tempo. Author Steve Waksman relates: [...] "From the opening bars, 'California Sun' becomes subject to the Ramones' distinctive brand of musical minimalism paired with sonic excess. The chords go by in a blur of distortion; the drums and bass kick at seemingly twice the speed of the Rivieras." [...] The twelfth track [...] "Commando" [...] has a theme which deals with war movies and contains multiple military references. Author Avram Mednick said the song was a successor to [...] "Blitzkrieg Bop", released on the band's debut album. He also noted that it has a [...] "bouncy melody and an infectious call-and-response chorus." [...] "You're Gonna Kill that Girl", which was written very early in the band's career, was also rooted in doo-wop genre. Mednick commented that it appealed highly to those tuning into the Ramones in the UK, and also said it has a [...] "lovely misogynistic tune." [...] The final guitar chord on the track is played by drummer Tommy since Johnny rarely played acoustic. The album's final track, [...] "You Should Never Have Opened That Door", was written by Dee Dee and Johnny, and circles themes of horror films and hints that people in these movies tend to be naïve and unintelligent.|$|E
500|$|Starting in 1984, Timex of Portugal {{developed}} and produced several Timex branded computers, including the Timex Computer 2048, highly {{compatible with the}} Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K, which was very successful in both Portugal and Poland. An NTSC version was also made, initially intended for a United States release, but it was sold only in Chile and Argentina. Timex of Portugal also made a PAL version of the TS2068, called the Timex Computer 2068 (or TC2068 for short) which had different buffers for both the ULA and the CPU, which significantly increased the compatibility with ZX Spectrum software {{when compared to the}} North American model (the TS2068). The expansion port was also modified and made to be 100% compatible with the ZX Spectrum's, which bypassed the need for a [...] "Twister Board" [...] expansion that the TS2068 needed {{in order to make it}} compatibile with ZX Spectrum expansion hardware. It also had the AY <b>sound</b> <b>output</b> routed to the monitor/TV speakers instead of the internal twitter. The software developed for the TC2068 is completely compatible with the TS2068, since the ROMs weren't altered. Timex of Portugal also developed a ZX Spectrum [...] "emulator" [...] on cartridge form that mapped the first 16kB exactly like the earlier TC2048 computer did. Several other upgrades were made available, including a BASIC64 cartridge that enabled the TC2068 to use high resolution (512x192) modes. Despite having an AY-3-8912 sound chip, it's not connected in the same ports as in the ZX Spectrum 128K, rendering the TC2084 incompatible with the AY sound that the Spectrum 128K games produced. Due to all its advantages compared to the usual TS2068, a North American company, Zebra Systems, licensed the Timex TC2068 and sold it in the United States as the Zebra Silver Avenger. They also sold the FDD 3000 as the Zebra FDD 3000 in a silver case (as opposed to the European black cases) to match their colour scheme. Timex of Portugal was working on a successor to the TC2068 called the TC3256, using a Z80A CPU and featuring 256kB of RAM, which would feature a ZX Spectrum BASIC operating mode and a CP/M operating mode, but the company pulled the plug on its development since that by the end of 1989, the 8bit market was no longer profitable. Only one complete and fully working prototype of the TC3256 was made.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike {{the other}} drums in a drumline, the bass drums are {{generally}} mounted sideways, with the drumhead facing horizontally, rather than vertically. This results in several things. [...] First of all, {{to ensure that}} a vibrating membrane is facing the audience, bass drummers must face perpendicular {{to the rest of the}} band and so are the only section in most groups whose bodies do not face the audience while playing. Consequently, bass drummers usually point their drums at the back of the bass drummer in front of them, so that the drum heads will all be lined up, from the audience's point of view, next to one another in order to produce optimal <b>sound</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E

A supporting experimental study was conducted utilizing an eight inch loudspeaker and a 30 inch loudspeaker at eleven source positions. The resulting standard deviation of <b>sound</b> power <b>output</b> of the smaller speaker is in excellent agreement with both the derived finite source theory and existing point source theory, if the theoretical data is adjusted to account for experimental incomplete spatial averaging.
