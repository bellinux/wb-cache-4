25|$|A1152: Under {{increasing}} pressure {{to sell a}} generic two button mouse with a <b>scroll</b> <b>wheel,</b> Apple decided to develop a mouse (in 2005) with touchpad-like capacitive controls instead of buttons, and featured a tiny integrated trackball {{in place of a}} scrollwheel.|$|E
25|$|It {{lacked a}} display, the {{trademark}} <b>scroll</b> <b>wheel,</b> playlist management features, and the games, address book, calendar, alarm, and notes capability of larger iPods; nor {{could it be}} used with iSync. Due to the codec not being ported, it was incapable of playing Apple Lossless and AIFF audio files.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>scroll</b> <b>wheels</b> on many {{computer}} mice employ detents {{to divide}} scrolling into discrete steps.|$|R
50|$|If {{a program}} {{supports}} <b>scroll</b> <b>wheels</b> natively, the Universal Scrolling feature will generally {{not interfere with}} the native implementation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Scroll</b> <b>wheels</b> are {{prevalent}} {{on modern}} computer mice {{and have become}} an integral part of the hardware interface. However, non-wheeled mice are still available.|$|R
25|$|In 2006, Hillcrest Labs {{introduced}} the Loop pointer, {{a remote control}} that used Hillcrest's Freespace motion control technology to allow users to control their televisions with natural gestures. The Loop had just four buttons and a <b>scroll</b> <b>wheel.</b> Freespace-enabled remote controls use radio waves to communicate with a USB antenna connected to a computer that is also connected to the television, so {{they do not need}} to be pointed at the PC, or even have a direct line of sight.|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, {{electronic}} fingerprint {{readers have}} been introduced for security applications such as log-in authentication for the identification of computer users. However, some less sophisticated devices have been discovered to be vulnerable to quite simple methods of deception, such as fake fingerprints cast in gels. In 2006, fingerprint sensors gained popularity in the notebook PC market. Built-in sensors in laptops, such as ThinkPads, VAIO, HP Pavilion and EliteBook laptops, and others also double as motion detectors for document scrolling, like the <b>scroll</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
25|$|For all Windows Vista Premium Ready PCs, {{when using}} Alt+Tab to switch between open windows, {{a preview of}} each open window appears instead of just the program icon. In addition, Windows Flip 3D enables users to flip through a {{cascading}} stack of their open windows using the mouse <b>scroll</b> <b>wheel,</b> much like Apple's Cover Flow. Windows can be stacked and rotated in 3D to provide views {{of all of them}} simultaneously. (The keyboard shortcuts are +, which makes Flip 3D disappear after releasing, ++, which keeps Flip 3D visible after releasing, and ++ to flip through open windows backwards). The window buttons on the taskbar show a thumbnail image of the window, when the mouse hovers over the button.|$|E
50|$|Scrolling can be {{controlled}} in other software-dependent ways by a PC mouse. Some <b>scroll</b> <b>wheels</b> can be pressed down, functioning like a button. Depending on the software, this allows both horizontal and vertical scrolling by dragging in the direction desired; when the mouse is moved to the original position, scrolling stops. A few <b>scroll</b> <b>wheels</b> can also be tilted, scrolling horizontally in one direction until released. On touchscreen devices, scrolling is a multi-touch gesture, done by swiping a finger on the screen vertically in the direction opposite to where the user wants to scroll to.|$|R
50|$|<b>Scroll</b> <b>wheels</b> {{can also}} be found on such {{handheld}} devices such as PDAs, portable digital audio players such as the original Apple iPod, or mobiles phones such as early Sony models and BlackBerry devices.|$|R
50|$|Most GUI environments neglect , {{which means}} {{scrolling}} must be accomplished with a mouse, using means such as scrollbars or <b>scroll</b> <b>wheels.</b> Often, the middle or the wheel mouse button {{works as a}} toggle determining if mouse movements will move the mouse cursor or scroll the contents in scroll window.|$|R
25|$|Gamers {{can use a}} <b>scroll</b> <b>wheel</b> for {{changing}} weapons (or for controlling scope-zoom magnification, in older games). On most first person shooter games, programming may also assign more functions to additional buttons on mice with more than three controls. A keyboard usually controls movement (for example, WASD for moving forward, left, backward and right, respectively) and other functions such as changing posture. Since the mouse serves for aiming, a mouse that tracks movement accurately and with less lag (latency) will give a player an advantage over players with less accurate or slower mice. In some cases the right mouse button {{may be used to}} move the player forward, either in lieu of, or in conjunction with the typical WASD configuration.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all DAPs {{consists}} {{of some kind}} of display screen, although there are exceptions, such as the iPod Shuffle, and a set of controls with which the user can browse through the library of music contained in the device, select a track, and play it back. The display, if the unit even has one, can be anything from a simple one or two line monochrome LCD display, similar to what are found on typical pocket calculators, to large, high-resolution, full-color displays capable of displaying photographs or viewing video content on. The controls can range anywhere from the simple buttons as are found on most typical CD players, such as for skipping through tracks or stopping/starting playback to full touch-screen controls, such as that found on the iPod Touch or the Zune HD. One of the more common methods of control is some type of the <b>scroll</b> <b>wheel</b> with associated buttons. This method of control was first introduced with the Apple iPod and many other manufacturers have created variants of this control scheme for their respective devices.|$|E
25|$|The ribbon, a {{panel that}} houses a fixed {{arrangement}} of command buttons and icons, organizes commands {{as a set}} of tabs, each grouping relevant commands. The ribbon is present in Microsoft Word 2007, Excel 2007, PowerPoint 2007, Access 2007 and some Outlook 2007 windows. The ribbon is not user customizable in Office 2007. Each application has a different set of tabs that exposes functions that the application offers. For example, while Excel has a tab for the graphing capabilities, Word does not; instead it has tabs to control the formatting of a text document. Within each tab, various related options may be grouped together. The ribbon is designed to make the features of the application more discoverable and accessible with fewer mouse clicks as compared to the menu-based UI used prior to Office 2007. Moving the mouse <b>scroll</b> <b>wheel</b> while on any of the tabs on the ribbon cyclesâ€”through the tabs. The ribbon can be minimized by double clicking the active section's title, such as the Home text in the picture below. Office 2007 does not natively support removing, modifying or replacing ribbon. Third party add-ins, however, can bring menus and toolbars back to Office 2007 or customize the ribbon commands. Add-ins that restore menus and toolbars include Classic Menu for Office, ToolbarToggle, and Ubitmenu. Others like RibbonCustomizer enable the customization of ribbons. Office 2010 does allow user customization of the ribbon out of the box.|$|E
50|$|Scrollmice {{almost always}} mount their <b>scroll</b> <b>wheels</b> on an {{internal}} spring-loaded frame and switch, so that simply pushing down makes them {{work as an}} extra button, made easier to do without accidentally spinning it by wheel detents present in most scrollmice. Thus most mice today effectively have three buttons.|$|R

50|$|In the 21st century, <b>scroll</b> <b>wheels</b> started {{appearing}} on keyboards as well, particularly on Logitech and Microsoft models. It is usually located {{to the left}} of the caps lock key. The implementation of <b>scroll</b> <b>wheels</b> on laptop computers has generally faded, while touchpads are often programmed with a pointing device gesture to substitute for them; such as allowing the edges to scroll the page (rather than to move the pointer), partly making up for the lack of a scroll wheel; touchpads with multitouch capability usually achieve scroll capability by touching and dragging two fingers on the touchpad at the same time; many Linux distributions offer a third method of scrolling using the touchpad, where the user will first activate scroll-mode by pressing in a corner of the pad, and then dragging in a circle around the center of the pad, letting go of the touchpad will switch back to the default mouse-mode.|$|R
2500|$|A <b>scroll</b> <b>wheel</b> (or mouse wheel), a {{hard plastic}} or rubbery disc on a {{computer}} mouse, is used to scroll a pointer up or down {{on a computer}} display. It is perpendicular to the mouse surface and is normally located between {{the left and right}} mouse buttons. Eric Michelman invented the <b>scroll</b> <b>wheel</b> at Microsoft by [...] in 1995. On December 16, 1998, Michelman filed the earliest patent for a <b>scroll</b> <b>wheel,</b> U.S. patent #6,940,488, which was later issued to him on September 6, 2005.|$|E

2500|$|Currently, Mac OS X is {{the only}} {{operating}} system that fully supports the mouse without third party software. When used with Mac OS X, the sensors can be set to launch applications or trigger features of the Apple operating system, such as Dashboard and ExposÃ©. If not used with Mac OS X, the mouse behaves as a four [...] "button" [...] mouse with a vertical and horizontal <b>scroll</b> <b>wheel.</b> There are third-party drivers (XMouse, AppleM) that provide more functions to users of other platforms such as Windows.|$|E
5000|$|This {{software}} {{allows the}} user to program all of the buttons available on a particular Logitech mouse or trackball model. For pointing input devices with <b>scroll</b> <b>wheels,</b> it allows the customization of scrolling behavior. It allows {{the user to}} customize the pointer speed and acceleration. It also comes with a [...] "Smart Move" [...] feature that causes the pointer to jump to the highlighted button of a new dialog box. In many respects it {{is similar to the}} Microsoft IntelliMouse software.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, Lincoln {{added two}} rocker {{switches}} {{on the steering wheel}} to activate various cruise control functions on the Continental and Continental Mark IV. In 1988, Pontiac offered a steering wheel with 12 buttons controlling various audio functions on the Trans-Am, 6000 STE and Bonneville. In the 1990s, a proliferation of new buttons began to appear on automobile steering wheels. Remote or alternate adjustments could include vehicle audio, telephone, and voice control navigation. Often <b>scroll</b> <b>wheels</b> or buttons are used to set volume levels or page through menus, change radio stations or audio tracks. These controls can use universal interfaces, wired or wirelessly.|$|R
50|$|Web pages {{will often}} require more screen space than is {{available}} for a particular display resolution. Most modern browsers will place a scrollbar (a sliding tool {{at the side of}} the screen that allows the user to move the page up or down, or side-to-side) in the window to allow the user to see all content. Scrolling horizontally is less prevalent than vertical scrolling, not only because such pages often do not print properly, but because it inconveniences the user more so than vertical scrolling would (because lines are horizontal; scrolling back and forth for every line is much more inconvenient than scrolling after reading a whole screen; also most computer keyboards have page up and down keys, and many computer mice have vertical <b>scroll</b> <b>wheels,</b> but the horizontal scrolling equivalents are rare). When web pages are stored in a common directory of a web server, they become a website.|$|R
2500|$|Some touchpads have [...] "hotspots", {{locations}} on the touchpad used for functionality beyond a mouse. For example, on certain touchpads, moving the finger along {{an edge of}} the touch pad will act as a <b>scroll</b> <b>wheel,</b> controlling the scrollbar and scrolling the window that has the focus vertically or horizontally. Many touchpads use two-finger dragging for scrolling. Also, some touchpad drivers support tap zones, regions where a tap will execute a function, for example, pausing a media player or launching an application. All of these functions are implemented in the touchpad device driver software, and can be disabled.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} BlackBerry device had a {{monochrome display}} while newer models installed color displays. All newer {{models have been}} optimized for [...] "thumbing", the use of only the thumbs to type on a keyboard. The Storm 1 and Storm 2 include a SureType keypad for typing. Originally, system navigation was achieved {{with the use of}} a <b>scroll</b> <b>wheel</b> mounted on the right side of device models prior to the 8700. The trackwheel was replaced by the trackball with the introduction of the Pearl series, which allowed four-way scrolling. The trackball was replaced by the optical trackpad with the introduction of the Curve 8500 series. Models made to use iDEN networks, such as Nextel, SouthernLINC, NII Holdings, and Mike also incorporate a push-to-talk (PTT) feature, similar to a two-way radio.|$|E
5000|$|Touchscreen PDAs {{intended}} for business use, {{such as the}} BlackBerry and Palm Treo, usually also offer full keyboards and <b>scroll</b> <b>wheels</b> or thumbwheels to facilitate data entry and navigation. Many touchscreen PDAs support some form of external keyboard as well. Specialized folding keyboards, which offer a full-sized keyboard but collapse into a compact size for transport, are available for many models. External keyboards may attach to the PDA directly, using a cable, or may use wireless technology such as infrared or Bluetooth to connect to the PDA. Newer PDAs, such as the HTC HD2, Apple iPhone, Apple iPod Touch, and Palm Pre, Palm Pre Plus, Palm Pixi, Palm Pixi Plus, Google Android (operating system) include more advanced forms of touchscreen that can register multiple touches simultaneously. These [...] "multi-touch" [...] displays allow for more sophisticated interfaces using various gestures entered {{with one or more}} fingers.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{consolidate}} research about artificial intelligence-based tools, {{the design and}} construc-tion of an autonomous robotic platform with simple mathematical model and high processing capacity is considered. The final prototype objective is to evaluate autonomous control strategies, artificial vision, route planning and collective intelligence. For this reason, the system was equipped with aFPGA as central control unit. In order to facilitate {{the development of a}} theoretical model, and provide the system with high mobility, the prototype was structured on a differential platform with two independent motors coupled with <b>scroll</b> <b>wheels,</b> and one third omni directional wheel of support. The mechanical structure was designed in acrylic (methacrylate), looking for mechanical strength, low weight, visualization of components and esthetic presentation. For primary space location, the prototype was equipped with encoded positionultrasonic sensors for wide range of vision. In addition, the system counts with ports to increase robot peripherals. The prototype was evaluated in laboratory, observing an excellent performance according to plan in design...|$|R
2500|$|On Unix and Unix-like {{operating}} systems, the key {{is usually}} given the X keysym [...] "Super" [...] (on earlier versions [...] "Meta" [...] was often used), and turns on the shift bit called MOD4. A common action that is not shared with Windows is for the key to allow dragging a window around from any location without raising it. Otherwise it is often used much like Windows, with press+release popping up a primary menu (GNOME Shell bringing up the Activities Overview, Cinnamon pops up its main system menu normally docked at lower-left of screen), and with combinations with letters performing actions such as run-command, often with the shortcuts and actions copied from Windows. In the Compiz window manager, the Super key causes the <b>scroll</b> <b>wheel</b> to zoom {{in or out of}} any part of the desktop.|$|E
2500|$|Apple was {{initially}} reluctant to embrace mice with multiple buttons and scroll wheels. Macs did not natively support pointing devices that featured multiple buttons, even from third parties, until Mac OS X arrived in 2001. Apple continued to offer only single button mice, in both wired and Bluetooth wireless versions, until August 2005, when it introduced the Mighty Mouse. While {{it looked like}} a traditional one-button mouse, it actually had four buttons and a scroll ball, capable of independent x- and y-axis movement. A Bluetooth version followed in July 2006. In October 2009, Apple introduced the Magic Mouse, which uses multi-touch gesture recognition (similar to that of the iPhone) instead of a physical <b>scroll</b> <b>wheel</b> or ball. It is available only in a wireless configuration, but the wired Mighty Mouse (re-branded as [...] "Apple Mouse") is still available as an alternative. Since 2010, Apple has also offered the Magic Trackpad as a means to control Macintosh desktop computers in a way similar to laptops.|$|E

40|$|Car brands {{are today}} {{competing}} over {{having the most}} advanced technology in their cars. The drivers today control the stereo which include radio, CD, MP 3 and satellite radio. They also control the climate, the GPS, surf the Internet and show a DVD for {{the kids in the}} backseat and so much more from the centerstack. All these functions have clattered the center-stack with buttons, "smart" interaction knobs as well as <b>scroll</b> <b>wheels.</b> The buttons feel the same and thereby force the driver to change focus from the main-task, which is driving, to the center-stack. The same attention demanding situation are with the interaction knobs. In order to see the feedback the interaction knob provides, the driver needs to look at a screen located somewhere in the center-stack. World wide driver inattention causes around 60. 000 deaths each year. This master-thesis describes the process of designing a non-distractive center-stack interaction. The reader will be introduced to the background of the problem, the dierent design suggestions that were taken into consideration as well as a given full presentation of the nal result.

40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) data should be interpreted in combination and {{in the context of}} relevant behavioral measurements. However, the strong magnetic environment of MRI scanner and the supine position of participants in the scanner significantly limit how participants' behavioral responses are recorded. This paper presents the design of a low-cost handheld response system (HRS) with a multi-configurable optomechanical design that utilizes a reflective-type intensity modulated fiber-optic sensor (FOS) and a programmable visual interface to accurately gather participants' behavioral responses during an fMRI experiment. Considering the effects of an input unit design on the participants' performance efficiency across age groups and physical and neurological (dis) ability, the optomechanical system is designed to provide flexibility in the range of an input module with easy change-out feature. Specifically, the input unit can be configured as a binary module such as push buttons or as an analog input device including a <b>scrolling</b> <b>wheel,</b> and one-dimensional joystick (lever arm). To achieve MRI-compatibility, all parts of the unit that are used inside the scanner bore are built from nonferromagnetic and off-the-shelf plastic materials. The MRI compatibility was evaluated on a 3. 0 Tesla MRI scanner running echo planar imaging (EPI) and the average time-variant signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) loss is limited to 2 %...|$|R
