25|$|The species fractus shows {{variable}} instability {{because it}} can be a subdivision of genus-types of different physical forms that have different stability characteristics. This subtype can be in the form of ragged but mostly stable stratiform sheets (<b>stratus</b> <b>fractus)</b> or small ragged cumuliform heaps with somewhat greater instability (cumulus fractus). When they form at low altitudes, stratiform and cumuliform genus-types can be torn up into shreds by brisk low level winds that create mechanical turbulence against the ground. Fractus clouds can form in precipitation at low altitudes, with or without brisk or gusty winds. They are closely associated with precipitating cloud systems of considerable vertical and sometimes horizontal extent, so they are also classified as accessory clouds under the name pannus (see section on supplementary features).|$|E
500|$|The species Cumulus fractus is ragged in {{appearance}} and can form in clear air as {{a precursor to}} cumulus humilis and larger cumulus species-types; or it can form in precipitation as the supplementary feature pannus (also called scud) which can also include <b>stratus</b> <b>fractus</b> of bad weather. Cumulus humilis clouds look like puffy, flattened shapes. Cumulus mediocris clouds look similar, except that they have some vertical development. Cumulus congestus clouds have a cauliflower-like structure and tower high into the atmosphere, hence their alternate name [...] "towering cumulus".

40|$|Diabatic heating (or Q 1) {{profiles}} {{associated with}} specific cloud types {{are produced by}} matching synoptic cloud observations with a sounding budget analysis during the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Kwajalein Experiment (KWAJEX), {{which took place in}} the Marshall Islands from late July through mid-September 1999. Fair-weather cumulus clouds produce up to 1 K day 1 of heating below 850 hPa and are associated with cooling throughout {{much of the rest of}} the troposphere. Cumulus congestus clouds produce heating on the order of 1 K day 1 up to 575 hPa and cooling in the mid- to upper troposphere. Cumulonimbus clouds produce heating through the depth of the troposphere, with a maximum of 3. 7 K day 1 near 550 hPa. Cloud types indicating widespread rain (<b>stratus</b> or cumulus <b>fractus</b> of bad weather at low levels and nimbostratus at midlevels) have the largest and most elevated heating, with values 10 K day 1 above 600 hPa. Other mid- and high-level cloud types are shown to be consistent with area-averaged rain rates and Q 1 profiles. Profiles of the divergence and apparent moisture sink (or Q 2) for convective clouds are also analyzed and are shown to be consistent with the physics of the heating profiles just described. 1...|$|R
2500|$|Of the {{stratiform}} group, high-level cirrostratus comprises two species. [...] Cirrostratus nebulosus has {{a rather}} diffuse appearance lacking in structural detail. [...] Cirrostratus fibratus is a species made of semi-merged filaments that are transitional {{to or from}} cirrus.

50|$|Fractus are {{accessory}} clouds, {{named for}} the type of cloud from which they were sheared. The two principal forms are cumulus fractus (formerly, fractocumulus) and <b>stratus</b> <b>fractus</b> (formerly, fractostratus). Fractus clouds may develop into cumulus if the ground heats enough to start convection. <b>Stratus</b> <b>fractus</b> is distinguishable from cumulus fractus by its smaller vertical extent, darker color, and by the greater dispersion of its particles.|$|E

50|$|Stratus {{nebulosus}} clouds {{appear as}} a featureless or nebulous veil or layer of stratus clouds with no distinctive features or structure. They are found at low altitudes, and {{is a good sign}} of atmospheric stability, which indicates continuous stable weather. Stratus nebulosus may produce light drizzle, or flakes of snow. <b>Stratus</b> <b>fractus</b> clouds on the other hand, appear with an irregular shape, and forms with a clearly fragmented or ragged appearance. They mostly appear under the precipitation of major rain-bearing clouds. These are the nimbostratus clouds, and the cumulonimbus clouds, and are classified as pannus clouds. <b>Stratus</b> <b>fractus</b> can also form beside mountain slopes, without the presence of nimbus clouds (clouds that precipitate), and their color can be from dark grey to almost white.|$|E
50|$|Fractonimbus are {{a form of}} <b>stratus</b> <b>fractus,</b> {{developing}} under precipitation clouds due to {{turbulent air}} movement. They are dark-gray and ragged in appearance. Fractonimbus exist only under precipitation clouds (such as nimbostratus, altostratus or cumulonimbus), and don't produce precipitation themselves. Fractonimbus may eventually merge completely with overlying nimbostratus clouds.|$|E

50|$|Stratus cumulogenitus clouds {{occur when}} the base of cumulus clouds spreads, {{creating}} a nebulous sheet of stratiform clouds.

The Stratus opacus variety appears as a nebulous or milky sheet of the nebulosus species, but are opaque enough to block the sun from view. Stratus Translucidus is another variety of the nebulosus species. These clouds are considered more thin than the opacus variety because this cloud is rather translucent, allowing {{the position of the}} sun or moon to be observed from earth's surface.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of the {{attenuation}} and backscattering {{properties of}} clouds {{is required to}} high resolution for several types of optical sensing systems. Such data was obtained in about 15 hours of flights through clouds {{in the vicinity of}} Washington, D. C. The flights were mainly through stratocumulus, altocumulus, stratus, and <b>stratus</b> <b>fractus</b> clouds and covered an altitude and temperature range of 300 to 3200 m and - 13 to 17 C. Two instruments were flown, each of which measured the backscatter from close range in two range bins to independently determine both the extinction and backscatter coefficients. The extinction and backscatter coefficients can be obtained from the signals in the two channels of each instrument, provided that the aerosol is uniform over the measurement region. When this assumptions holds, the extinction coefficient is derived basically from the ratio of the signal in the two channels; the backscatter coefficient can then be obtained from the signal in either channel...|$|E
40|$|This {{work will}} {{contribute}} to the scale-dependent verification of precipitation forecasts of the German Weather Service’s Lokal-Modell (LM). A new observational dataset separating stratiform and convective precipitation at a one-hour temporal resolution was produced for Germany for the year 2004. The underlaying idea of this work is to connect rain producing cloud types taken from synoptic observations and derived cloud types from Meteosat data by the interpolation scheme. The accuracy of the cloud types derived from Meteosat data are compared with observed cloud types by in an error matrix for the period of 1992 to 2004. The distinction between convective and stratiform precipitation was made by using hourly observations of clouds, ‘weather watch’ and the amount of precipitation for the period 1992 to 2004. In summary the clouds of the convective scale are cumulus, cumulus congestus as well as cumulo-nimbus/nimbostratus and for stratiform precipitation events <b>stratus</b> <b>fractus,</b> stratocumulus as soon as altocumulus with altostratus/nimbostratus. In {{order to be able to}} use cloud types for the interpolation, these data are normalized to yield values of frequency of rainfall. A precipitation analysis is created, first without satellite data and in a second step using satellite data. The comparison shows that the rainfall record for Germany in 2004 "including satellite data" is approximately 33 mm higher than without satellite data. The proportion of convective rainfall is 10 mm higher with satellite data; for stratiform precipitation, it is 43 mm lower with satellite data than without. For the first time, a country-wide analysis of the diurnal cycle of scale dependent precipitation could be performed. It was shown that the diurnal cycle of precipitation in Germany highly depends on the diurnal cycle of convective precipitation. It is shown that compared with the rainfall record maximum, precipitation events generated by the model (both total rainfall and convective rainfall) are forecast three hours too early in the diurnal cycle. In contrast to the rainfall analysis performed by the Free University of Berlin, the model precipitation underestimates the sum of annual convective precipitation by 144 mm, while stratiform precipitation is overestimated by 237 mm. These results show that spatial distribution of rainfall clearly indicates the difference between the seasons. It is demonstrated that convective rainfall in winter and autumn is greatly underestimated in the model. As a result of the overall assessment of precipitation forecast using the Lokal-Modell, it should be noted that structures that show pronounced regional heterogeneity are not adequately represented at the convective scale...|$|E
