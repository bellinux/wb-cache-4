50|$|However, {{the signal}} {{coverage}} {{area of a}} given cell site may change according {{to the time of}} day, weather, and physical obstructions in relation to where a cellular device attempts to access service. The maps of cell <b>site</b> <b>coverage</b> areas used by law enforcement may also lack precision as a general matter. For these reasons, it is beneficial to use a StingRay and a test phone to map out the precise coverage areas of all cell sites appearing in the HCSLI records. This is typically done at the same time of day and under the same weather conditions that were in effect when the HCSLI was logged. Using a StingRay to conduct base station surveys in this manner allows for mapping out cell <b>site</b> <b>coverage</b> areas that more accurately match the coverage areas that were in effect when the cellular device was used.|$|E

40|$|The temperature-programmed {{desorption}} (TPD) of pyridine from {{silica gel}} has been analysed with the variable heating, constant coverage procedure proposed by Richards and Rees (R. E. Richards and L. V. C. Rees, Zeolites, 1986, 6, 17). This results in curves of activation energies of desorption {{as a function}} of coverage. A weak heterogeneity of the silica gel surface is observed in contrast with other pyridine sorption studies. Two adsorption sites, the free and bridged hydroxyl groups, contribute to the surface heterogeneity. The relative amounts of the two sites on the surface are deduced from the calculated activation energy vs. coverage profiles. An attempt is made to extrapolate the absolute concentrations of free and bridged hydroxyls from the relative <b>site</b> <b>coverages...</b>|$|R

The first and third schemes emphasised the Queensland Government presence on the approach to the new Fitzroy River Bridge. Cabinet opted for the larger <b>site</b> <b>coverage</b> of the third smaller scaled alternative, and approval was given to proceed with one wing to the Bolsover Street frontage. A model of the U-shaped development was constructed, which John Hitch believes was the first architectural model in Queensland.|$|E
