5|$|The {{construction}} of the Scottish Parliament Building has generated controversy in several respects. Rising costs {{and the use of}} public money to fund the project generated most controversy. Initial estimates for constructing a new building were projected to be between £10m and £40m in 1997. By early 2004, the estimated final cost of the project was set at £430m, <b>some</b> <b>ten</b> times greater.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouth of}} the river {{has not always been}} at Littlehampton. Until the later fifteenth century it joined the River Adur at Lancing <b>some</b> <b>ten</b> miles to the east before {{entering}} the sea. This estuary became blocked with shingle by the eastward drift of the tides, pushing the Adur towards Shoreham-by-Sea, while the Arun broke out at Worthing, Goring and Ferring at various times, until it formed its present estuary at Littlehampton between 1500 and 1530.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} first three form monophyletic clades. The wolf-like canids and the South American canids together form the tribe Canini. Molecular data imply a North American origin of living Canidae <b>some</b> <b>ten</b> million years ago and an African origin of wolf-like canines (Canis, Cuon, and Lycaon), with the jackals being the most basal of this group. The South American clade is rooted by the maned wolf and bush dog, and the fox-like canids by the fennec fox and Blanford's fox. The grey fox and island fox are basal to the other clades; however, this topological difference is not strongly supported.|$|E

5|$|From Boston, Edwards {{moved to}} New York {{to stay for}} <b>some</b> <b>ten</b> years, {{performing}} on stage and participating in insect studies. He {{was active in the}} Brooklyn and New York Entomological Societies. In 1881, he co-founded and edited a butterfly enthusiast's periodical entitled Papilio, named for the genus Papilio in the swallowtail butterfly family, Papilionidae. Edwards served as editor until January 1884 when he gave the reins to his friend Eugene Murray-Aaron of Philadelphia. Papilio was published until 1885 when its subscription base was merged into the more general Entomologia Americana, published by the Brooklyn Entomological Society.|$|E
5|$|In late 2014, Russia {{offered the}} Su-35 to Indonesia {{as the country}} sought to replace its ageing F-5E Tiger II fleet. The {{following}} year, the Indonesian Ministry of Defence selected the Su-35 ahead of the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, F-16, and Saab JAS 39 Gripen; the Defence Ministry cited the Indonesian Air Force's familiarity with the Su-27SK and Su-30MK2 {{as the reason for}} the aircraft's selection. There were some initial reports that the country was to order a squadron of up to sixteen aircraft, but the number was later reduced to <b>some</b> <b>ten</b> aircraft. By mid-2017, negotiations between the two parties for the sale of the Su-35 had reached an advanced stage, with the Indonesian government later agreed in principle to conduct a barter trade of agricultural products for a reported eleven aircraft.|$|E
5|$|On 6July 1553 King EdwardVI {{died and}} the Duke of Northumberland {{attempted}} to transfer the English Crown to Lady Jane Grey, who was married to his second youngest son, Guildford Dudley. Robert Dudley led a force of 300 into Norfolk where Mary Tudor was assembling her followers. After <b>some</b> <b>ten</b> days in the county and securing several towns for Jane, he took King's Lynn and proclaimed her in the market-place. The next day, 19July, Jane's reign was over in London. Soon, the townsmen of King's Lynn seized Robert Dudley {{and the rest of}} his small troop and sent him to Framlingham Castle before Mary I.|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} the onset phase of ten great hard X-ray bursts is presented. It is shown from hard X-ray and radio {{observations}} in different wavelength ranges that the energization of the electrons proceeds on a global time-scale for <b>some</b> <b>tens</b> of seconds. In nine of the bursts, two phases of emission can be distinguished during the onset phase: the preflash phase (during which emission up to an energy limit ranging from <b>some</b> <b>tens</b> of keV to 200 keV is observed) followed <b>ten</b> to <b>some</b> <b>tens</b> of seconds later by the flash phase (where the count rate in all detector channels rises simultaneously to within some seconds). For two of the events, strong gamma-ray line emission is observed and is shown to start close to {{the onset of the}} flash phase...|$|R
5|$|Throughout his life, but {{especially}} during the 1770s, Bellman also wrote religious poetry, seeing no conflict with his bacchanalian works; he published collections of his religious poems in 1781 and 1787. He wrote <b>some</b> <b>ten</b> plays (none with particularly strong plots) as divertimentos, some of them later serving as entertainments at the royal court. The plays fill Volume 6 of his collected works. In 1783, Bellman brought out The Temple of Bacchus (Bacchi Tempel), perhaps hoping to establish {{his reputation as a}} poet, rather than the merry entertainer that he was in fact known as at the time; but he always stood out in people's minds as unique, a different kind of writer and performer.|$|E
5|$|Willy Vandersteen used a wild {{variety of}} themes and {{influences}} {{in his work}} from early on. He made fairytales, historic series, westerns, but also science fiction and many contemporary comics. While some series like De Familie Snoek and Bessy stuck very close to their origin (an everyday Flemish contemporary family for the former, and a pioneer family in the American Old West in the latter), others were more loose. De Rode Ridder, {{the story of a}} medieval knight, wandered from Arthurian tales over the crusades until the explorations of the fifteenth and sixteenth century, thereby spanning <b>some</b> <b>ten</b> centuries, and later (when Vandersteen was less involved in the series) brought in many elements of sword and sorcery and fantasy.|$|E
5|$|Between 17:48 and 17:52, 11 German dreadnoughts, {{including}} Rheinland, {{engaged and}} opened fire on the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, though the range and poor visibility prevented effective fire, which was soon checked. <b>Some</b> <b>ten</b> minutes later Rheinland again opened fire on the British cruisers, targeting what was most likely , though without success. By 20:15, the German fleet had faced the deployed Grand Fleet {{for a second time}} and was forced to turn away; in doing so, the order of the German line was reversed, with Rheinland third from the front, behind Westfalen and Nassau. At 21:22, crewmen aboard Rheinland and Westfalen, the two leading ships in the German line, spotted two torpedo tracks {{that turned out to be}} imaginary. The ships were then forced to slow down in order to allow the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group to pass ahead. Around 22:00, Rheinland and Westfalen observed unidentified light forces in the gathering darkness. After flashing a challenge via searchlight that was ignored, the two ships turned away to starboard in order to evade any torpedoes that might have been fired. The rest of I Battle Squadron followed them.|$|E

5|$|By 1910, {{there were}} 18 daily {{services}} along the Clevedon branch, four on Sundays. A GWR pagoda hut {{was built in}} the 1910s at the east end of the eastbound platform, but this was removed <b>some</b> <b>ten</b> years later. By the 1920s Yatton had 40 staff employed, including a boy selling chocolate and cigarettes, and issued almost 60,000 tickets. Traffic on the Clevedon branch was still climbing, now up to 21 services on weekdays and five on Sundays. However, despite this success, there were some problems. Better road transport was reducing traffic along the Wrington line, and the main line was stretched to capacity. To combat this latter problem, goods loops were laid either side of the station – east for 1.25 miles to Claverham from 6 April 1925 and west for 1.75 miles to Huish level crossing on 26 May 1925. The station itself however remained a two-track pinch point.|$|E
5|$|Hannah's planned three-year term as Chief of the Air Staff was {{cut short}} by <b>some</b> <b>ten</b> months when he {{accepted}} an offer to serve as Governor of Queensland, becoming the first officer in the RAAF to receive a vice-regal appointment.

Hannah {{did not have a}} strong connection with Queensland {{at the time of his}} appointment, and had only lived in the state during his period as commander of RAAF Station Amberley between 1949 and 1951. He claimed not to have actively sought the governorship, and was criticised for failing to consult with senior colleagues before making his decision to retire early from his position as head of the Air Force. He was replaced as CAS by his deputy, Air Vice Marshal (later Air Marshal Sir) Charles Read.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 23 October New Jersey steamed north to rearm before taking up {{position}} {{in support of the}} 3rd Marine Division 25 October. That day she shelled enemy troops located by a spotter plane. The next day New Jersey engaged targets of opportunity, destroying 11 structures, seven bunkers, a concrete observation tower, and an enemy trench line. She also received hostile fire when North Vietnamese gunners attempted to strike at New Jersey with artillery positioned near Cap Lay. <b>Some</b> <b>ten</b> to twelve rounds were launched at New Jersey; however, the rounds fired landed well short of the battleship. Aerial spotters were called in to look at the suspected gun position; they reported no artillery present but fresh tire tracks leading to a concealed area, suggesting that there had been artillery there earlier. Armed with this information New Jersey fired five 16inch shells at the site, but in the darkness spotters were unable to confirm any hits.|$|E

5|$|The Bessy comics {{were also}} {{published}} in Felix, a German comic magazine by Bastei Verlag. From 1965 on, {{they wanted to}} publish a complete new story every month, a rhythm they increased to twice a month in 1966. Unable to produce so fast, Vandersteen had to expand his Studio considerably. Led by Karel Verschuere, a team of <b>some</b> <b>ten</b> young artists mass-produced the comics, which were of considerable lower quality. The {{most important of these}} artists were Frank Sels and Edgar Gastmans, while many stories were produced by Daniël Janssens. When in late 1967 Verschuere quit, {{and at the same time}} Bastei increased the rhythm again, now to one complete comic a week, the Studio was disbanded and Sels and Gastmans started to work on a free lance basis. The next year, they decided to go behind Vandersteen's back and to sell directly to the Germans. Vandersteen then had to reorganize the Bessy Studio and hired Jeff Broeckx. The Studio continued until 1985, with artists like Patrick van Lierde, Ronald Van Riet, Eugeen Goossens, and Walter Laureyssens. It produced more than 900 Bessy-comics.|$|E
5|$|To {{achieve that}} result, Varrick takes care {{to prevent the}} case from going to Florida, Alisandros' {{favorite}} battleground. It is much better for them to let jurisdiction be claimed by Chicago federal judge Harry Seawright, with whom Rogan Rothberg has some ties. A bonus from Varrick's {{point of view is}} the fact that the Chicago tort lawsuit was filed by such a minor and inexperienced firm as Finley & Figg; it is confidently assumed that Karros would make short work of them in court. The case is soon expedited on Seawright's docket with Finley & Figg's claim singled out of the tort claimants and Karros takes action to have Finley & Figg's eight death cases heard separately. The specific case singled out to serve as the test case is one in which Finley & Figg represents the widow of a man who died after taking Krayoxx but he was also taking prior to his death a mixture of <b>some</b> <b>ten</b> other drugs, so that it is virtually impossible to pinpoint the effect of Krayoxx.|$|E
5|$|While the pay was {{relatively}} good, it still left many players {{looking for other}} jobs during the off-season, while the owners were all wealthy men. The conditions led to two organizing efforts at forming a player's union, which Smythe was vehemently against. From 1957 onwards, Smythe, along with other NHL owners including James D. Norris of the Chicago Black Hawks and his half brother Bruce Norris of the Detroit Red Wings were accused of union busting activities related to the attempt by Ted Lindsay {{and a group of}} NHL players to form an NHL Players Association. Mr. Smythe's role in those affairs are dramatized in the movie, Net Worth. Jimmy Thomson, who was acting captain of the Maple Leafs when the players started to organize was singled out by Smythe. Smythe detailed all the monies Thomson had been paid by the organization going back to junior, while he arranged for Thomson to be left off the team, allegedly calling Thomson a traitor and publicly blaming him for the team's poor season. Thomson finally announced to the press that he would never play again for the Maple Leafs. Thomson and Tod Sloan were traded away to Chicago. The NHL owners eventually agreed to make some concessions to the players, such as contributing to the players' pensions. The owners were able to temporarily head off the formation of the union, although it would eventually be organized <b>some</b> <b>ten</b> years later.|$|E
