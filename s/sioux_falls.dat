40|$|Abstract: Improving {{the service}} {{quality of the}} public {{transport}} systems {{has always been an}} interesting research area in the field of transportation planning. Public transit system expansion and enhancement has been known as a recognized way to improve congested metropolitan areas. In order to make a transit system more attractive to people, both long and short term management strategies should be considered. Fleet re-assignment to a bus network, a noticeable component of the public transit system, was the focus of this study. It was introduced as a short term management strategy to help the operators maintain service quality without confusing the users by abrupt changes in the system. The proposed algorithm, Quasi-Gradient Fleet Assignment, prioritized the bus lines based on the partial derivatives of total travel time with respect to line frequencies. The algorithm improved the total system cost by 12 % just by re-assigning the frequencies of the vehicles to the bus lines in a hypothetical transit network in the city of <b>Sioux</b> <b>Fall,</b> South Dakota...|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{alleviating}} traffic congestion, this paper proposes a scheme to encourage travelers to carpool by traffic restriction. By a variational inequity we describe travelers’ mode (solo driving and carpooling) and route choice under user equilibrium principle {{in the context of}} fixed demand and detect the performance of a simple network with various restriction links, restriction proportions, and carpooling costs. Then the optimal traffic restriction scheme aiming at minimal total travel cost is designed through a bilevel program and applied to a <b>Sioux</b> <b>Fall</b> network example with genetic algorithm. According to various requirements, optimal restriction regions and proportions for restricted automobiles are captured. From the results it is found that traffic restriction scheme is possible to enhance carpooling and alleviate congestion. However, higher carpooling demand is not always helpful to the whole network. The topology of network, OD demand, and carpooling cost are included in the factors influencing the performance of the traffic system...|$|R
