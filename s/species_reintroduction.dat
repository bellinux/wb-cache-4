5|$|Cats {{have a high}} {{breeding}} rate. Under controlled breeding, {{they can}} be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by neutering, {{as well as the}} abandonment of former household pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring population control. In certain areas outside cats' native range, this has contributed, along with habitat destruction and other factors, to the extinction of many bird species. Cats have been known to extirpate a bird species within specific regions and {{may have contributed to the}} extinction of isolated island populations. Cats are thought to be primarily responsible for the extinction of 33 species of birds, and the presence of feral and free-ranging cats makes some otherwise suitable locations unsuitable for attempted <b>species</b> <b>reintroduction.</b>|$|E
25|$|Elements {{of concern}} to the area are fire, over- or under-grazing, native <b>species</b> <b>reintroduction,</b> human {{recreational}} (camping and hunting) and educational/scientific use, resource exploration, linear development, and invasive species. Invasive species, primarily weeds, are a significant threat that crowd out native plant species and reduce habitat and food sources for native animals, birds, fish, and insects. Weeds are quick colonizers that often move into an area disturbed by fire or human activity. Linear developments such as roads, pipelines, and powerlines often provide a vector for invasive species to enter new areas. Because of their rapid and opportunistic spread, weeds also often lack the deep root system of native plants and thus contribute to bank instability and soil erosion. The nodding thistle weed (Carduus nutans) was discovered {{in the area in}} 2006. Several other weed species have been found in the natural area, including the highly aggressive downy brome (Bromus tectorum), creeping meadow foxtail (Alopecurus arundinaceus), crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia). Several of these species have invaded from across the U.S. border into Canada. Formerly utilized as a reclamation species, crested wheatgrass has had detrimental effects on soil and grazing. Russian olive, imported as a soil stabilizer, windbreak, and ornamental, reduces biodiversity of riparian areas.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{predictive}} modelling to plan reintroductions {{and manage}} reintroduced populations has increased steadily since the mid- 1990 s, with Australia and New Zealand at the forefront. We overview {{the types of}} models commonly used for <b>species</b> <b>reintroductions,</b> focusing on Australian and New Zealand examples. Site selection, release strategies (e. g. number, composition and timing), population viability and management impacts are the key issues often investigated. We discuss {{how to deal with}} uncertainties associated with parameter estimation, stochasticity, model selection, integrating modelling approaches and decision making. Finally, we highlight three promising modelling approaches for planning <b>species</b> <b>reintroductions</b> and modelling reintroduced populations: decision theory and optimisation, individual-based modelling and Bayesian hierarchical modelling...|$|R

50|$|Capturing as much genetic {{diversity}} as possible, measured as heterozygosity, {{is a good}} rule of thumb to follow in <b>species</b> <b>reintroductions.</b> Some protocols suggest that sourcing approximately 30 individuals from a population will capture 95% of the {{genetic diversity}}.

5000|$|<b>Species</b> <b>reintroduction</b> is the {{deliberate}} {{release of a}} species into the wild, from captivity or other areas where the organism survives. The goal of <b>species</b> <b>reintroduction</b> {{is to establish a}} healthy, genetically diverse, self-sustaining population to an area where it has been extirpated, or to augment an existing population. A species that needs reintroduction is usually one whose existence has become threatened or endangered in the wild. However, reintroduction of a species can also be for pest control. For example, wolves being reintroduced to a wild area because of an overpopulation of elk or deer. Because reintroduction may involve returning native species to localities where they had been extirpated, some prefer the term [...] "reestablishment".|$|E
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{approaches}} to <b>species</b> <b>reintroduction.</b> The optimal strategy will depend on the biology of the organism.

40|$|<b>Reintroduction</b> {{of native}} <b>species</b> has become {{increasingly}} important in conservation worldwide for recovery of rare species and restoration purposes. However, few studies have reported the outcome of reintroduction efforts in plant species. Using data from the literature combined with a questionnaire survey, this paper analyses 249 plant <b>species</b> <b>reintroductions</b> worldwide by assessing the methods used and the results obtained from these reintroduction experiments. The objectives were: (1) to examine how successful plant <b>species</b> <b>reintroductions</b> have been so far in establishing or significantly augmenting viable, self-sustaining populations in nature; (2) to determine {{the conditions under which}} we might expect plant <b>species</b> <b>reintroductions</b> to be most successful; (3) to make the results of this survey available for future plant reintroduction trials. Results indicate that survival, flowering and fruiting rates of reintroduced plants are generally quite low (on average 52 %, 19 % and 16 %, respectively). Furthermore, our results show a success rate decline in individual experiments with time. Survival rates reported in the literature are also much higher (78 % on average) than those mentioned by survey participants (33 % on average). We identified various parameters that positively influence plant reintroduction outcomes, e. g. working in protected sites, using seedlings, increasing the number of reintroduced individuals, mixing material from diverse populations, using transplants from stable source populations, site preparation or management effort and knowledge of the genetic variation of the target species. This study also revealed shortcomings of common experimental designs that greatly limit the interpretation of plant reintroduction studies: (1) insufficient monitoring following reintroduction (usually ceasing after 4 years); (2) inadequate documentation, which is especially acute for reintroductions that are regarded as failures; (3) lack of understanding of the underlying reasons for decline in existing plant populations; (4) overly optimistic evaluation of success based on short-term results; and (5) poorly defined success criteria for reintroduction projects. We therefore conclude that the value of plant reintroductions as a conservation tool could be improved by: (1) an increased focus on species biology; (2) using a higher number of transplants (preferring seedlings rather than seeds); (3) taking better account of seed production and recruitment when assessing the success of reintroductions; (4) a consistent long-term monitoring after reintroduction. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Previously, {{the last}} {{sighting}} {{of a bear}} {{in what is now}} Germany was recorded in 1838 when hunters shot a bear in Bavaria. Initially heralded as a welcome visitor and a symbol of the success of endangered <b>species</b> <b>reintroduction</b> programs, his dietary preferences for sheep, chickens, and beehives led government officials to believe that he could become a threat to humans, and they ordered that he be shot or captured.|$|E
50|$|Conservation {{behavior}} {{is aimed at}} applying an understanding of animal behavior to solve problems {{in the field of}} conservation biology. These are problems that may arise during conservation efforts such as captive breeding, <b>species</b> <b>reintroduction,</b> reserve connectivity, and wildlife management. By using patterns in animal behavior, biologists can be successful in these conservation efforts. This is done by understanding the proximate and ultimate causes of problems that arise. For example, understanding how proximate processes affect survival can help biologist train captive-reared animals to recognize predators post-release. Ultimate causes also have a clear benefit to conservation. For example, understanding social relationships that lead to fitness (biology) can help biologists manage wildlife that exhibit infanticide. Conservation projects may {{have a better chance of}} being successful if biologists search for a deeper understanding of how animals make adaptive decisions.|$|E
30|$|Niche {{differentiation}} may betray current, ongoing {{competition between}} two sympatric species or reflect evolutionary responses to historic competition that drove species apart. The best opportunity {{to test whether}} ongoing competition contributes to niche differentiation is to test for behavioral shifts by the subordinate competitor in controlled experiments in which the abundance of the dominant competitor is manipulated. Because these circumstances are difficult to coordinate in natural settings for wide-ranging species, researchers seize opportunities presented by <b>species</b> <b>reintroductions.</b> We tested for new competition between reintroduced wolves and resident cougars in the Southern Yellowstone Ecosystem to assess whether wolves might be impacting the realized niche of sympatric cougars.|$|R
40|$|The Convention on Biological Diversity 1992 {{requires}} {{contracting parties}} to take ex-situ conservation {{measures to protect}} biodiversity. This paper considers {{the effectiveness of the}} Zoos Directive in implementing this obligation within the European Union. The directive requires zoos to have an education role and at least one further conservation activity, which may be research, training, information exchange, captive breeding, or <b>species</b> <b>reintroductions.</b> However, the Convention requires parties to engage in all of these activities. EU member states have been reluctant to implement the directive. In any event, it is unlikely significantly to affect the conservation activities of the majority of zoos, as they are either already in compliance or they may comply with minimal effort. Most significantly, the directive does not specifically require zoos to participate in the captive breeding and <b>reintroduction</b> of endangered <b>species,</b> and this is arguably their most important potential (if not actual) conservation role...|$|R

50|$|The {{behavioral}} {{balance between}} timidity and boldness in Persian fallow deer is vital {{in establishing a}} long-lasting <b>species</b> <b>reintroduction.</b> Timidity describes the antipredator behavior exhibited in the deer that {{have been exposed to}} perceived threats from predators and have adopted a more careful and hesitant disposition when navigating their surroundings. Though the increased hesitance of deer raised in the wild often reduces dispersal rates, this timidity can {{have a positive effect on}} a Persian fallow deer’s ability to survive in the wild by limiting a deer's risk of being poached or preyed upon. Boldness refers to the risk-taking attitude shown by deer that are willing to capitalize on perceived opportunities and have a reduced concern for the consequences of such actions. The deer that are more daring generally manifest a greater degree of population dispersal in the wild. In Persian fallow deer reintroductions, securing a balance between these two factors can prove difficult, especially when information on population dynamics and individual and group behavior is limited.|$|E

40|$|Recolonization {{by native}} <b>species</b> {{following}} <b>reintroduction</b> can affect resident species {{through a variety}} of processes. We examined the effects of natural recolonization by coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch on sculpin (Cottus rhotus and Cottus gulosus), small benthic fishes, in a small forest stream in Western Washington, USA. Provision fish passage around a small dam allowed coho access to habitat, which had been inaccessible for over 100 [*]years. We found that density (g[*]m− 2 and number m− 2) was unchanged, and body condition (the slope of the relationship between length and weight) of sculpin tended to increase from before relative to a 5 -year period following recolonization. The proportion of sculpin comprising the total fish assemblage decreased after coho colonization relative to before but remained stable for a 5 -year period after coho reintroduction, whereas coho density increased over fivefold. Additionally, we used Akaike's information criteria to evaluate the relative importance of physical and biological variables to predict sculpin density in pool habitats during the initial coho recolonization period. Physical microhabitat variables had little support for predicting sculpin density, whereas there was a significant support for stream temperature; cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) density and year were the most important predictors of sculpin density. Coho density was not significant in any model. Our results indicate coho introduction and subsequent recolonization have to date had minimal individual or population level effects on sculpin, therefore demonstrating that <b>species</b> <b>reintroductions</b> into their native range can have no measurable effect on resident organisms.

According to the climate-model the parts of Britain occupied by the hen harrier are the least climatically suitable.

40|$|The {{study showed}} that density {{estimation}} of Eurasian lynx corresponds to 1. 3 and 1. 2 independent individuals per 100 km 2 in the Jvorniky study area for the two time periods and 0. 8 independent individuals per 100 km 2 for Beskydy study area. The study failed to identify other large carnivores such a wolf (Canis lupus) and bear (Ursus arctos) from both Beskydy and Javorniky study areas. The estimated density of Lynx is low and their numbers should increase in future. There is enough prey base to support the existing population in the two study areas.

40|$|Restoration of {{extirpated species}} via captive {{breeding}} has typically relied on population viability {{as the primary}} criterion for evaluating success. This criterion is inadequate when <b>species</b> <b>reintroduction</b> is undertaken to restore ecological functions and interactions. Herein {{we report on the}} demographic and ecological outcomes of a five-decade-long population restoration program for a critically endangered species of "ecosystem engineer": the endemic Española giant Galapagos tortoise (Chelonoidis hoodensis). Our analysis of complementary datasets on tortoise demography and movement, tortoise-plant interactions and Española Island's vegetation history indicated that the repatriated tortoise population is secure from a strictly demographic perspective: about half of tortoises released on the island since 1975 were still alive in 2007, in situ reproduction is now significant, and future extinction risk is low with or without continued repatriation. Declining survival rates, somatic growth rates, and body condition of repatriates suggests, however, that resources for continued population growth are increasingly limited. Soil stable carbon isotope analyses indicated a pronounced shift toward woody plants in the recent history of the island's plant community, likely a legacy of changes in competitive relations between woody and herbaceous plants induced by now-eradicated feral goats and prolonged absence of tortoises. Woody plants are of concern because they block tortoise movement and hinder recruitment of cactus [...] a critical resource for tortoises. Tortoises restrict themselves to remnant cactus patches and areas of low woody plant density {{in the center of the}} island despite an apparent capacity to colonize a far greater range, likely because of a lack of cactus elsewhere on the island. We conclude that ecosystem-level criteria for success of <b>species</b> <b>reintroduction</b> efforts take much longer to achieve than population-level criteria; moreover, reinstatement of endangered species as fully functioning ecosystem engineers may often require large-scale habitat restoration efforts in concert with population restoration...|$|E

40|$|Rewilding is {{an optimistic}} {{environmental}} agenda {{to reverse the}} loss of biodiversity and reconnect society with nature. This chapter explores Britain’s ecological history, back to the Last Interglacial {{before the arrival of}} modern humans, when the climate was similar to today, to analyse how conservationists can learn from the past to rewild the ecosystems of the present and prepare for an uncertain future. Because there is no single point in history that should or could be recreated, rewilding focuses on re-establishing naturally dynamic ecological processes that, through an appropriate sequence of <b>species</b> <b>reintroductions,</b> attempts to move the ecosystem towards a more appropriately biodiverse and functional state. A state that is self-sustaining in the present climate, and that projected for the near future. Specifically, this chapter explores a rewilding solution to conservation challenges associated with over-grazing, limited germination niche availability, and river dynamics: the reintroduction of wolves, wild boar, and beaver respectively. This sequence of reintroductions is suggested to be complimentary, each altering ecosystem dynamics to facilitate the return of the next. Evidence indicates wolves will reduce deer abundance and re-distribute browsing intensity promoting tree regeneration, particularly in riparian areas, increasing woodland availability to the more habitat-dependent wild boar and beaver. An important message behind rewilding is that a rich biodiversity with all guilds well represented, including the ones that polarize public opinion, such as large predators, are important components of ecosystem service rich and self-sustaining ecosystems, particularly in core areas...|$|R
