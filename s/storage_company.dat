5000|$|Mail Storage {{requires}} more stringent and diligent packing than standard moving, since the packages will {{be handled by}} shippers or a mail <b>storage</b> <b>company's</b> pickup/delivery service.

Mail <b>Storage</b> <b>companies</b> often request customers to use thick walled or reinforced shipping boxes, to reinforce the seams with heavy duty packing tape, and to pack boxes to their fullest (while not over-stuffing them). This advice applies to boxes provided by Mail Storage firms as well as boxes provided by the customer. Many mail <b>storage</b> <b>companies</b> charge re-boxing and handling fees for boxes that are poorly packed or damaged on arrival. In addition, insurance charges that were paid by customers may not apply for boxes that were damaged in transit.|$|R
