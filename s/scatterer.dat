Titanium tetrachloride has been used to create naval smokescreens. The hydrogen chloride immediately absorbs water to form an aerosol of hydrochloric acid that efficiently scatter light.

25|$|The {{pressure}} transmitting {{medium is}} an important component in any high-pressure experiment. The medium fills the space within the sample 'chamber' and applies the pressure being transmitted to the medium onto to the sample. In a good high-pressure experiment, the medium should maintain a homogeneous distribution of pressure on the sample. In other words, the medium must stay hydrostatic to ensure uniform compressibility of the sample. Once a pressure transmitting medium has lost its hydrostaticity, a pressure gradient forms in the chamber that increases with increasing pressure. This gradient can greatly affect the sample, compromising results. The medium must also be inert, as to not interact with the sample, and stable under high pressures. For experiments with laser heating, the medium should have low thermal conductivity. If an optical technique is being employed, the medium should be optically transparent and for x-ray diffraction, the medium should be a poor x-ray <b>scatterer</b> – as to not contribute to the signal.|$|E
25|$|Attached to the {{cylindrical}} ballistic {{case was}} a natural-uranium liner, the radiation case. The SHRIMP design used an approximately 2.5cm thick uranium radiation case. Its internal surface was lined with ~240 μm thick copper liner made from 0.08 μm thick copper foil, due to copper possessing excellent reflecting properties, increasing the overall albedo of the hohlraum. Hohlraum albedo {{is a very important}} design parameter for any inertial-confinement configuration. A relatively high albedo permits higher interstage coupling due to the more favorable azimuthal and latitudinal angles of reflected radiation. The limiting value of the albedo for high-Z materials is reached when the thickness is 5–10 g/cm, or 0.5–1.0 free paths. Thus, a hohlraum made of uranium much thicker than a free path of uranium would be disadvantageous in terms of bomb weight and use of raw materials. At the same time the angular anisotropy increases as the atomic number of the <b>scatterer</b> material is reduced. Thus the use of copper, or in other devices of gold or aluminium, as hohlraum liners is imperative as the greater the value of Z of the <b>scatterer</b> the greater this absorption probability will be. There are 2 sources of X-rays in the hohlraum; primary's irradiance which is dominant at the beginning and during the pulse rise and the wall which is important during the required radiation temperature's (T) plateau. The primary emits radiation {{in a manner similar to}} a flash bulb, and the secondary needs constant T to properly implode. This constant wall temperature is dictated by the ablation pressure requirements to drive compression which lay on average at about 0.4 keV (out of a range of 0.2 to 2 keV) corresponding to several thousand kelvins. Wall temperature depended on the temperature of the primary's core which peaked at about 5.4 keV during boosted-fission. The final wall-temperature, which corresponds to energy of the wall-reradiated X-rays to the secondary's pusher, also drops due to losses from the hohlraum material itself. Natural uranium nails, lined to the top of their head with copper, attached the radiation case to the ballistic case. The nails were bolted in vertical arrays in a double-shear configuration to better distribute the shear loads. This method of attaching the radiation case to the ballistic case was first used successfully in the Ivy Mike device. The radiation case had a parabolic end, which housed the COBRA primary that was employed to create the conditions needed to start the fusion reaction, and its other end was a cylinder, as also seen in Bravo's declassified film.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Consider the {{scattering}} of a time-harmonic plane wave incident on a two-scale heterogeneous medium, {{which consists of}} <b>scatterers</b> that are {{much smaller than the}} wavelength and extended <b>scatterers</b> that are comparable to the wavelength. In addition to the standard inverse obstacle scattering prob-lem, i. e., to image the shape of extended <b>scatterers</b> as well as the location of the point <b>scatterers</b> where strong multiple scattering are present, there are a few other interesting issues such as imaging a target in a cluttered environment without resolving the clutters, and increasing the effective aperture by utilizing the multiple scattering between extended <b>scatterers</b> and point <b>scatterers</b> whose location are known. Some preliminary computational study will be given in this paper. To simulate the wave propagation in the heterogeneous medium with both point and extended <b>scatterers,</b> a generalized Foldy–Lax formulation and a physically based block Gauss–Seidel iterative method are used to solve the two-scale multiple scattering problem. Based on the singular value decom-position of the response matrix constructed from the far-field pattern, imaging functions are designed to visualize the location of the point <b>scatterers</b> and the shape of the extended obstacle <b>scatterers.</b> The method leads to a direct imag-ing algorithm which is simple and efficient since no direct solver or iteration is needed. The imaging functions are robust with respect to the measure-ment noise. Numerical experiments are presented for uniformly and randomly distributed point <b>scatterers</b> and multiple extended obstacle <b>scatterers</b> in both two- and three-dimensional cases. 1...|$|R

50|$|When an area {{element is}} {{radiating}} {{as a result}} of being illuminated by an external source, the irradiance (energy or photons/time/area) landing on that area element will be proportional to the cosine of the angle between the illuminating source and the normal. A Lambertian <b>scatterer</b> will then scatter this light according to the same cosine law as a Lambertian emitter. This means that although the radiance of the surface depends on the angle from the normal to the illuminating source, it will not depend on the angle from the normal to the observer. For example, if the moon were a Lambertian <b>scatterer,</b> one would expect to see its scattered brightness appreciably diminish towards the terminator due to the increased angle at which sunlight hit the surface. The fact that it does not diminish illustrates that the moon is not a Lambertian <b>scatterer,</b> and in fact tends to scatter more light into the oblique angles than would a Lambertian <b>scatterer.</b>|$|E
