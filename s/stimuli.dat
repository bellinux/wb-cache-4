5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at the <b>stimuli,</b> significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same <b>stimuli,</b> supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of <b>stimuli</b> children viewed. The time they looked at <b>stimuli</b> decreased for all types of <b>stimuli</b> from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the <b>stimuli.</b> When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of <b>stimuli.</b>|$|E
5|$|The pain pathway {{is mostly}} {{transmitted}} via myelinated Aδ (sharp or stabbing pain) and unmyelinated C nerve fibers (slow, dull, aching, or burning pain) of the trigeminal nerve, which supplies sensation {{to the teeth}} and gums via many divisions and branches. Initially, pain is felt while noxious <b>stimuli</b> are applied (such as cold). Continued exposure decreases firing thresholds of the nerves, allowing normally non-painful <b>stimuli</b> to trigger pain (allodynia). Should the insult continue, noxious <b>stimuli</b> produce larger discharges in the nerve, perceived as more intense pain. Spontaneous pain may occur if the firing threshold is decreased so it can fire without stimulus (hyperalgesia). The physical component of pain is processed in the medullary spinal cord and perceived in the frontal cortex. Because pain perception involves overlapping sensory systems and an emotional component, individual responses to identical <b>stimuli</b> are variable.|$|E
5|$|Tumors cause pain by {{crushing}} or infiltrating tissue, triggering {{infection or}} inflammation, or releasing chemicals that make normally non-painful <b>stimuli</b> painful.|$|E
50|$|A neutral <b>stimulus</b> is a <b>stimulus</b> which {{initially}} produces {{no specific}} response other than focusing attention. In classical conditioning, when used {{together with an}} unconditioned <b>stimulus,</b> the neutral <b>stimulus</b> becomes a conditioned <b>stimulus.</b> With repeated presentations of both the neutral <b>stimulus</b> and the unconditioned <b>stimulus,</b> the neutral <b>stimulus</b> will elicit a response as well, known as a conditioned response. Once the neutral <b>stimulus</b> elicits a conditioned response, the neutral <b>stimulus</b> becomes known as a conditioned <b>stimulus.</b> The conditioned response {{is the same as}} the unconditioned response, but occurs in the presence of the conditioned <b>stimulus</b> rather than the unconditioned <b>stimulus.</b>|$|R
50|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} {{is defined}} as a change in the valence of a <b>stimulus</b> that is due to the pairing of that <b>stimulus</b> with another positive or negative <b>stimulus.</b> The first <b>stimulus</b> {{is often referred to as}} the conditioned <b>stimulus</b> and the second <b>stimulus</b> as the unconditioned <b>stimulus.</b> A conditioned <b>stimulus</b> becomes more positive when it has been paired with a positive unconditioned <b>stimulus</b> and more negative when it has been paired with a negative unconditioned <b>stimulus.</b> Evaluative conditioning thus refers to attitude formation or change toward an object due to that object's mere co-occurrence with another object.|$|R
40|$|Four monkeys {{were exposed}} to free operant {{discriminated}} avoidance (discriminated Sidman avoidance) in a parametric study of safe <b>stimulus</b> and warning <b>stimulus</b> duration. The safe <b>stimulus</b> was assigned values of 2, 5, 10, 20, and 40 sec, the warning <b>stimulus</b> values of 2, 5, and 20 sec. Rate of responding was a decreasing negatively accelerated function of safe <b>stimulus</b> duration, with a small effect attributable to warning <b>stimulus</b> duration. Control of response rate by safe <b>stimulus</b> duration {{was due to the}} predominance of responding {{in the presence of the}} warning <b>stimulus.</b> Responding during the safe <b>stimulus</b> was independent of the temporal parameters except at schedules combining short safe and short warning <b>stimulus</b> durations. Latencies of responses in the warning <b>stimulus</b> were analyzed, and mean latency was found to be a direct function of warning <b>stimulus</b> duration, with only one exception, resulting from the order in which the warning <b>stimulus</b> values were presented. Shock rate was not systematically related to either of the manipulated parameters...|$|R
5|$|Cooperativity is {{observed}} when two synapses are activated by weak <b>stimuli</b> incapable of inducing LTP when stimulated individually. But upon simultaneous weak stimulation, both synapses undergo LTP in a cooperative fashion. Synaptic tagging {{does not explain}} how multiple weak <b>stimuli</b> can result in a collective stimulus sufficient to induce LTP (this is explained by the postsynaptic summation of EPSPs described previously). Rather, synaptic tagging explains the ability of weakly stimulated synapses, none of which are capable of independently generating LTP, to receive the products of protein synthesis initiated collectively. As before, this may be accomplished through the synthesis of a local synaptic tag following weak synaptic stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} <b>stimuli</b> that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these <b>stimuli</b> cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain {{what he or she}} wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E
5|$|The escape {{response}} in gastropods—the perception of <b>stimuli</b> (for example, {{the presence of}} a predator nearby) and a subsequent escape motion—is a frequent target of behavioural studies. In gastropods, the perception of environmental chemical <b>stimuli</b> originating, for example, from food or other organisms is possibly mediated by sensory organs such as the osphradium. In the case of L.canarium, the perception of a predator can occur through chemoreception or vision (a well-developed sense in strombid gastropods). The presence of a predator can significantly alter the movement pattern of L.canarium, inducing an increase in the frequency of leaps.|$|E
5000|$|The stimulus-model {{comparator}} theory {{emerged from}} the research of Sokolov who used the orienting response as the cornerstone of his studies, and operationally defining the orienting response as EEG activity. Orienting responses are heightened sensitivity experienced by an organism when exposed to a new or changing <b>stimulus.</b> Orienting responses can result in overt, observable behaviors as well as psychophysiological responses such as EEG activity and undergo habituation with repeated presentation of the eliciting <b>stimulus.</b> The Sokolov model [...] assumes that when a <b>stimulus</b> is experienced several times the nervous system creates {{a model of the}} expected <b>stimulus</b> (a <b>stimulus</b> model). With additional presentations of the <b>stimulus</b> the experienced <b>stimulus</b> is compared with the <b>stimulus</b> model. If the experienced <b>stimulus</b> matches the <b>stimulus</b> model responding is inhibited. At first the <b>stimulus</b> model is not a very good representation of the presented <b>stimulus</b> and therefore there is a mismatch and responding continues, but with additional presentations the <b>stimulus</b> model is improved; consequently {{there is no longer a}} mismatch and responding is inhibited causing habituation. However, if the <b>stimulus</b> is changed so that it no longer matches the <b>stimulus</b> model the inhibition of the orienting response is weakened, and an orienting response returns. Sokolov places the location of the Stimulus-Model within the cerebral cortex of the brain.|$|R
40|$|<b>Stimulus</b> {{contrast}} and duration effects on visual temporal integration and order judgment {{were examined in}} a unified paradigm. <b>Stimulus</b> onset asynchrony was governed by {{the duration of the}} first <b>stimulus</b> in Experiment 1, and by the interstimulus interval in Experiment 2. In Experiment 1, integration and order uncertainty increased when a low contrast <b>stimulus</b> followed a high contrast <b>stimulus,</b> but only when the second <b>stimulus</b> was 20 or 30 ms. At 10 ms duration of the second <b>stimulus,</b> integration and uncertainty decreased. Temporal order judgments at all durations of the second <b>stimulus</b> were better for a low contrast <b>stimulus</b> following a high contrast one. By contrast, in Experiment 2, a low contrast <b>stimulus</b> following a high contrast <b>stimulus</b> consistently produced higher integration rates, order uncertainty, and lower order accuracy. Contrast and duration thus interacted, breaking correspondence between integration and order perception. The results are interpreted in a tentative conceptual framework...|$|R
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to maintain <b>stimulus</b> control in animal psychophysical studies using the tracking method. Loss of <b>stimulus</b> control is characterized by wandering thresholds and responses {{in the absence of}} the <b>stimulus.</b> Rats were trained to make a variable number of licking responses to turn on an auditory <b>stimulus.</b> A response on a lever in the presence of the <b>stimulus</b> was reinforced with food. Two precedures were added to improve <b>stimulus</b> control. First, lever responses {{in the absence of the}} <b>stimulus</b> raised the intensity of the <b>stimulus</b> at the next presentation; second, rate of reinforcement in the threshold region was maintained at about the same level as that in the suprathreshold region by reducing the number of licking responses required to turn on the <b>stimulus.</b> Using these two procedures, <b>stimulus</b> control was improved and maintained and reliable auditory intensity thresholds were obtained...|$|R
25|$|Temporal {{synchrony}} is {{not necessary}} for the McGurk effect to be present. Subjects are still strongly influenced by auditory <b>stimuli</b> even when it lagged the visual <b>stimuli</b> by 180 milliseconds (point at which McGurk effect begins to weaken). There was less tolerance {{for the lack of}} synchrony if the auditory <b>stimuli</b> preceded the visual <b>stimuli.</b> In order to produce a significant weakening of the McGurk effect, the auditory <b>stimuli</b> had to precede the visual <b>stimuli</b> by 60 milliseconds, or lag by 240 milliseconds.|$|E
25|$|While these {{previous}} studies {{focused on how}} emotion affects memory for emotionally arousing <b>stimuli,</b> in their arousal-biased competition theory, Mather and Sutherland (2011) argue that how arousal influences memory for non-emotional <b>stimuli</b> depends on the priority of those <b>stimuli</b> {{at the time of}} the arousal. Arousal enhances perception and memory of high priority <b>stimuli</b> but impairs perception and memory of low priority <b>stimuli.</b> Priority can be determined by bottom-up salience or by top-down goals.|$|E
25|$|Combining {{the brain}} bias towards facial {{processing}} and surface discovery, a follow-up study by Dr. Vuilleumier exposed subjects to paired visual <b>stimuli</b> in three phases. In the initial phase, <b>stimuli</b> were simply bilateral pairs, and extinction frequency was measured. In the next stage, the <b>stimuli</b> were surrounded with an oval, {{so that they}} appeared to represent eyes in a face. The extinction rate for this appearance was greatly reduced. Finally, the patients were shown the <b>stimuli</b> minus the contextual oval – however, the reduced extinction rate persisted, as though the patients had learned to group these <b>stimuli.</b> The effect did not occur when the <b>stimuli</b> were surrounded by a nonoval shape, pointing towards facial processing as being {{the key to this}} phenomenon.|$|E
50|$|A supernormal <b>stimulus</b> or superstimulus is {{an exaggerated}} {{version of a}} <b>stimulus</b> to which there is an {{existing}} response tendency, or any <b>stimulus</b> that elicits a response more strongly than the <b>stimulus</b> for which it evolved.|$|R
50|$|Classical {{conditioning}} {{occurs when}} a conditioned <b>stimulus</b> (CS) is paired with an unconditioned <b>stimulus</b> (US). Usually, the conditioned <b>stimulus</b> is a neutral <b>stimulus</b> (e.g., {{the sound of a}} tuning fork), the unconditioned <b>stimulus</b> is biologically potent (e.g., the taste of food) and the unconditioned response (UR) to the unconditioned <b>stimulus</b> is an unlearned reflex response (e.g., salivation). After pairing is repeated (some learning may occur after only one pairing), the organism exhibits a conditioned response (CR) to the conditioned <b>stimulus</b> when the conditioned <b>stimulus</b> is presented alone. The conditioned response is usually similar to the unconditioned response (see below), but unlike the unconditioned response, it must be acquired through experience and is relatively impermanent.|$|R
40|$|In {{discrimination}} {{training with}} the Lyons' blackout method, pecks {{to the negative}} <b>stimulus</b> are prevented by darkening the chamber each time the subject approaches the negative <b>stimulus.</b> <b>Stimulus</b> generalization along a <b>stimulus</b> dimension was measured after training with this method. For comparison, generalization was also measured after reinforced responding to the positive <b>stimulus</b> without discrimination training, and after discrimination training by extinction of pecks to the negative <b>stimulus.</b> The blackout procedure and the extinction of pecks to the negative <b>stimulus</b> both produced a peak shift in the generalization gradients. The results suggest that after discrimination training in which {{the positive and negative}} <b>stimulus</b> are on the same continuum, the blackout method produces extinction-like effects on generalization tests...|$|R

25|$|When {{we hear a}} car honk, {{we would}} {{determine}} which car triggers the honk by which car we see is the spatially closest to the honk. It's a spatial congruent example by combining visual and auditory <b>stimuli.</b> On the other hand, {{the sound and the}} pictures of a TV program would be integrated as structural congruent by combining visual and auditory <b>stimuli.</b> However, if the sound and the pictures were not meaningfully fit, we would segregate the two <b>stimuli.</b> Therefore, whether spatial or structural congruent should not only combine the <b>stimuli</b> but also be determined by understanding.|$|E
50|$|To {{establish}} unconscious perception {{a demonstration}} of the absence of some critical <b>stimulus</b> is established and the effect of the same <b>stimulus</b> on behavior is tested. To establish the absence of the <b>stimulus,</b> {{the degree to which a}} critical <b>stimulus</b> reaches conscious awareness is assessed, by testing whether a subject can acknowledge or perceive the presence of the <b>stimulus.</b> This is called a direct measure (D) of processing, as the task requires some type of direct report on the perception of the critical <b>stimulus</b> from the subject. Also, one must assess the degree to which the <b>stimulus</b> affects a certain behavior. This process is the indirect measure (I) as responses of something other than the critical <b>stimulus</b> is measured.|$|R
40|$|A {{peripheral}} uniform <b>stimulus</b> on {{a uniform}} background tends to fade when a ring enclosing the <b>stimulus</b> is flashed briefly, indicating that neural signals {{external to the}} <b>stimulus</b> such as those from the ring or those from the background tend to inhibit the onset-response or after-discharge of the <b>stimulus.</b> In this study, a peripheral achromatic line was flashed briefly on an achromatic background while the subject was steadily fixating on a point on the background. It was predicted that the <b>stimulus</b> line would fade due to background inhibition of the onset-response or after-discharge of the <b>stimulus.</b> On a reference line, subjects indicated two points delimiting {{the part of the}} <b>stimulus</b> line which looked uniform in intensity of color. These points converged {{toward the center of the}} reference line as the luminance of the <b>stimulus</b> line approached that of the background.

40|$|Purpose. This study {{presents}} a two-degree customized animated <b>stimulus</b> developed to evaluate smooth pursuit {{in children and}} investigates the effect of its predetermined characteristics (<b>stimulus</b> type and size) in an adult population.

25|$|Visual {{extinction}} {{has also}} been used to demonstrate brain bias towards gestalt processing. When presented with a figure containing illusory contours, patients were able to correctly report the presence of <b>stimuli</b> in both contralesional and ipsilesional hemispheres, due to their unconscious processing of the whole field to produce the illusion. This experiment implied that the attention center prioritizes the visualization of surfaces over other <b>stimuli</b> – therefore, although under race model the ipsilesional <b>stimuli</b> should extinguish the contralesional, {{the creation of the}} gestalt takes priority over detection of both. Further, a study using Gabor signals (alternating blurred and noisy black and white bars, commonly used by opticians in diagnostic tests) investigated how the orientation of these signals affected their extinction rate. Bilateral <b>stimuli</b> were least extinguished when both <b>stimuli</b> were oriented horizontally, although both <b>stimuli</b> being oriented vertically also showed a reduction in extinguishing rate when compared to one stimulus vertical and one horizontal – in what could be assumed by the brain to represent two different surfaces.|$|E
