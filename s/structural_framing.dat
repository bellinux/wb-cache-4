40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The {{selection}} of the appropriate <b>structural</b> <b>frame</b> for a building during the conceptual design stage {{is crucial to the}} overall performance and value delivered to clients. Although several {{attempts have been made to}} develop IT-based decision support tools to select the <b>structural</b> <b>frame,</b> these have failed to recognise the importance of ‘soft’ performance criteria, primarily because of the complexity inherent in the selection process. In reality, <b>structural</b> <b>frame</b> selection is usually based upon heuristic decision-making dominated by subjectivity and qualitative reasoning. Following a thorough review of literature in the building performance domain, a tool that incorporates both ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ performance metrics for selecting appropriate <b>structural</b> <b>frame</b> was developed. The tool requires a systematic evaluation of the importance of each criterion and the likely performance achieved using various <b>structural</b> <b>frame</b> options. A worked example is provided to demonstrate how a project team can use this tool. This tool essentially helps to make explicit the most important issues to be considered during the selection process, which should demonstrably lead to improved performance and added value for clients...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} an {{appropriate}} <b>structural</b> <b>frame</b> {{can contribute to}} effective short- and long-term performance, and enhance client satisfaction but limited research indicates that the issues taken into account during <b>structural</b> <b>frame</b> selection are not very well understood. With this in mind, a major research programme, including interviews and an industry survey, examined the attitudes of project managers, cost consultants and construction clients in analysing the issues they typically consider when choosing the <b>structural</b> <b>frame</b> for a building, and to provide insights about how such decisions are made in practice. Ten key issues were identified as being the most important affecting <b>structural</b> <b>frame</b> selection, but {{the extent to which}} different parties considered these and at what stage was found to vary. Also, the variations, between what these parties themselves think of the issues and what others perceive their attitudes to be, were examined. In particular, the results showed that what clients perceive differs considerably from how clients' views are perceived by others. For instance, according to cost consultants and project managers, their clients' preference to regularly select a 'preferred' frame type or material is a far more widespread tendency than clients themselves actually acknowledged.

40|$|Closed access. The {{choice of}} <b>structural</b> <b>frame</b> is {{fundamental}} to both the short- and long-term performance of a building. An objective and systematic selection process for facilitating the transparent consideration of decision criteria has, however, yet to be developed. This paper reports {{on the development of}} a framework that incorporates both ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ performance measures for selecting an appropriate <b>structural</b> <b>frame.</b> The framework requires a systematic evaluation of the importance of each criterion and the likely performance achieved by using various <b>structural</b> <b>frame</b> options. A worked example is provided to demonstrate how project teams can use this framework during the frame decision-making process. To investigate its practical utility, the framework was then tested within two case study projects. The participating engineers responded positively towards the use of multi-criteria for <b>structural</b> <b>frame</b> selection and expressed the view that the proposed framework fosters objective decision making. It is argued that the framework could lead to project teams making more transparent and appropriate frame selection in the future...|$|R

40|$|Multi-storey {{reinforced}} concrete <b>structural</b> <b>frames</b> represent {{some of the}} most congested structural elements. Placing and consolidating concrete in such <b>structural</b> <b>frames</b> imposes substantial challenges. This offers a unique area of application for self-consolidating concrete because of its inherent ability to flow under its own weight and fill congested sections, complicated formwork and hard-to-reach areas. However, research is needed to demonstrate the ability of SCC <b>structural</b> <b>frames</b> to resist vertical and lateral loads. In the present research, full-scale 3 -m high beam-column joints reinforced as per the Canadian Standard CSA A 23. 3 - 94 were made with ordinary and self-consolidating concrete. They were tested under reversed cyclic loading applied at the beam tip and at constant vertical load applied on the column. The beam-column joint specimens were instrumented with linear variable displacement transducers and strain gauges to determine load displacement traces and cumulative dissipated energy. This paper compares the performance of normal and self-consolidating concrete <b>structural</b> <b>frames</b> and discusses the potential use of SCC in such application...|$|R

40|$|Decisions {{made during}} the {{briefing}} and conceptual design stages of a building project are critical to its success. One of the earliest major decisions which can {{have a significant effect}} on downstream events and results is the selection of the <b>structural</b> <b>frame.</b> Given its importance to the efficacy of the finished building, the <b>structural</b> <b>frame</b> selection process should arguably be objective and transparent, the final decision being based on the frame's ability to perform against a range of criteria appropriate to the scheme in question. However, the heuristics underpinning such decisions tend not to be explicit and thus, are difficult for inexperienced clients to understand. This article reports on research which examined the criteria used by clients, structural engineers, architects and main contractors when selecting <b>structural</b> <b>frames.</b> These were established via a postal questionnaire survey of a stratified sample of design professionals, contractors and client organizations. The analysis reveals marked differences in the perceived importance of the criteria identified amongst the respondents, which may result in conflicts between design and construction advisers and their clients should they be made explicit in the design process. Nevertheless, it is important that such differences are revealed within the decision-making process if more appropriate design decisions are to be made in the future.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The <b>structural</b> <b>frame</b> is an {{essential}} element of any large building, influencing its short and long-term performance. Studies of current practice with regards to frame choice indicate that <b>structural</b> <b>frames</b> tend to be selected based on heuristic decision-making processes dominated by subjectivity and qualitative reasoning. This paper reports on the development of a decision support framework aimed at making the process more systematic and transparent. Following a literature review and industry survey, a framework for comparing the performance of structural options against agreed criteria was developed, using two measures, Importance (I) and Performance (P), which can be used to calculate a Performance Weighted Score (PWS). This framework was then incorporated into a Virtual Reality (VR) simulator as a means of assessing ‘soft’ criteria, alongside cost and programme. The final product is a simple to use and yet highly informative tool that can be used from the earliest concept stage to objectively guide <b>structural</b> <b>frame</b> selection. It was devised to consider the full range of concrete and steel frame options and can be applied to virtually any building type. Initial feedback from industrialists collected through its application on two case studies and demonstration ‘road shows’ have revealed the tool’s capabilities for both informing the frame choice process and ensuring that the most appropriate and best value decision is made with regards to <b>structural</b> <b>frame</b> type...|$|R

5000|$|The “stacked box” design {{building}} {{is built on}} a slope on the outer campus Drive Ring. The building was originally planned to have a steel <b>structural</b> <b>framing</b> but because of rising steel prices the <b>structural</b> <b>framing</b> had to be switched to concrete for the final design development. The lower cost of concrete framing meant that the custom stainless steel “skin” could be developed within the University of Toronto’s budget requirements. The building’s exterior had two “skins,” the main “skin” is insulated and waterproof while the separate exterior steel panel “skin” reflected heat. Inside the building are state-of-the-art classrooms, seminar rooms, computer facilities, learning spaces and laboratories. There is also a student lounge and unique outdoor terrace for students to relax and socialize. [...] Kongats Architects Toronto’s principal Alar Kongats said on an e-mail interview, “The TDHSC is designed to achieve a North American LEED Gold sustainability designation.”.

A cladding system of shimmering metal fins animates the stacked box arrangement of volumes, and gives the building a distinctive set-piece quality amid its campus neighbours. Interiors are luminous and civilised with ample natural light, and the sliding stacked volumes create terraces for encounter and engagement. The quality of detailing is exceptional and the sophisticated use of materials lifts the building into a class of its own." ...|$|E
