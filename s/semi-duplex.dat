50|$|The network {{operated}} in the 160 MHz VHF band, using frequency modulation (FM) on 160-162 MHz for the mobile unit, and 168-170 MHz for the base station. Most mobile sets were <b>semi-duplex,</b> {{but some of}} the more expensive units were full duplex. Each subscriber was assigned a five digit phone number.|$|E
50|$|A radio {{transceiver}} for the radio-controlled train order signalling system is located here. An analogue radio repeater is {{located within the}} booking office {{which is used to}} overhear conversations between driver and the controller (located in the signal box at Ravenglass). The railway uses a type of <b>semi-duplex</b> private business radio system, similar to the marine VHF system.|$|E
5000|$|Marine VHF mostly uses [...] "simplex" [...] transmission, where {{communication}} {{can only}} take place in one direction at a time. A transmit button on the set or microphone determines whether it is operating as a transmitter or a receiver. Some channels, however, are [...] "duplex" [...] transmission channels where communication can take place in both directions simultaneously when the equipment on both ends allow it (full duplex), otherwise [...] "semi-duplex" [...] is used. Each duplex channel has two frequency assignments. Duplex channels {{can be used to}} place calls on the public telephone system for a fee via a marine operator. When full duplex is used, the call is similar to one using a mobile phone or landline. When <b>semi-duplex</b> is used, voice is only carried one way at a time and the party on the boat must press the transmit button only when speaking. This facility is still available in some areas, though its use has largely died out with the advent of mobile and satellite phones. Marine VHF radios can also receive weather radio broadcasts, where they are available.|$|E
40|$|Biomedical {{engineering}} combines myriad engineering disciplines, {{developing and}} applying novel technologies and approaches to improve quality of life. Visual prostheses are one example, aiming to provide artificial vision {{to those with}} profound visual impairment. This is achieved through elicitation of spots of light, a phenomenon known as phosphenes, the feasibility {{of which has been}} clearly demonstrated in the past. Visual prostheses with a high number of electrodes are now the subject of intensive research, with recent clinical trials reinforcing the efficacy of such devices. Several architectures have been proposed to address numerous challenges associated with high resolution devices, with the prominent restrictions being on the volume and power available. A multi-implant architecture is a solution to address the aforementioned challenges, however now the difficulties lie in ensuring safety of the inter-implant interface by addressing the associated risks, often neglected in the past. Such an architecture also requires improvements on the communications methods between the external device and the implant to meet high data rate and the low power requirements of a high resolution device. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, a new wireless transceiver suitable for multi-coil configuration is presented. The forward link, from the external device to the implant, incorporates a displacement variation tolerant frequency shift keying demodulator, with the backward link realised using an active on-off keying transmitter. To achieve low power requirements, a new semi-static threshold-triggered delay element has been investigated and fabricated using a 0. 35 µm HVCMOS technology, exhibiting superior performance over other conventional delay elements. The second part of this thesis addresses the path of investigation towards a multi-implant architecture based 98 channel neurostimulator with an inter-implant interface consisting only of two wires, carrying both power and <b>semi-duplex</b> data. The interface is AC-coupled to both prevent high levels of DC current in the presence of insulation failures and to maintain a charge balanced interface. This interface is monitored for leakage currents within the stimulator itself. The stimulator is fabricated using a 0. 35 µm HV CMOS technology and occupies 4. 9 x 4. 9 mm 2 without the need of any external discrete components, making it suitable for chip-scale packaging...|$|E
