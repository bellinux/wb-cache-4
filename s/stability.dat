40|$|Carbocations are key {{intermediates}} in many organic reactions, {{and hence}} reaction mechanisms {{as well as}} reaction rates involving carbocation intermediates could be affected by their <b>stabilities.</b> Relative <b>stabilities</b> and factors influ-encing the <b>stabilities</b> of carbocations in solution have been well demonstrated, and one of important trends to stabilize them is to add additional alkyl groups. 1 Nevertheless, the intrinsic <b>stabilities</b> of carbocations should be determined in the gas phase rather than in solution, because the relative <b>stabilities</b> of carbocations in solutions might be strongly influenced by the solvent effects due to their characteristic positive charge. For example, ionization of tert-butyl chloride, (CH 3) 3 CCl → (CH 3) 3 C+ + Cl−, is highly endothermic by 153 kcal mol− 1 in the gas phase indicating unobservably slow reaction. 2 Whereas it has been well known that the ionizatio...|$|R

40|$|The high {{alternation}} of nematic thermal <b>stabilities</b> {{found in}} the series of ω-phenylalkyl 4 -(4 '-phenylbenzylideneamino) cinnamates as the homologous series was ascended has been further exaggerated by substituting the terminal phenyl ester ring with methyl or chloro substituents in the 3 "- or 4 "-positions. Nematic phases were found only when an even number (n) of methylene units occurred in the alkylene chain. Smectic thermal <b>stabilities</b> also alternated as {{each of the four}} series of esters was ascended. However, the smectic A thermal <b>stabilities</b> decreased and the smectic B thermal <b>stabilities</b> increased on passing from even to odd values of n. In some cases this caused the thermal <b>stabilities</b> of the smectic A and B phases to coincide for odd values of n. When this occurred, a unique texture was observed microscopically at the I-S transition. Although no SA-SB transition could be detected microscopically or by D. T. A., miscibility studies indicated that a transitional SA phase still existed. This suggests {{that it is necessary to}} form a transitional SA phase intermediate between the amorphous liquid and a SB phase, both on heating and cooling. This transition has been called SAB-I. Smectic E phases were also found for many of the sixteen new esters, and the thermal <b>stabilities</b> of SE phases, like those of SB phases, increased for odd values of n.

5|$|The {{relevance}} of primary implant <b>stability</b> decreases gradually with regrowth of bone tissue around the implant {{in the first}} weeks after surgery, leading to secondary <b>stability.</b> Secondary <b>stability</b> {{is different from the}} initial stabilization, because it results from the ongoing process of bone regrowth into the implant (osseointegration). When this healing process is complete, the initial mechanical <b>stability</b> becomes biological <b>stability.</b> Primary <b>stability</b> is critical to implantation success until bone regrowth maximizes mechanical and biological support of the implant. Regrowth usually occurs during the 3–4 weeks after implantation. Insufficient primary <b>stability,</b> or high initial implant mobility, can lead to failure.|$|E

To establish the sequences of kinetic or thermodynamic <b>stabilities</b> of co-ordi-nation compounds in thermal dissociation processes, it is indispensable to calculate the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the processes. Ever since thermal analysis has been in general use {{for the study of}} synthetic co-ordination compounds, the traditional procedure for the evaluation of the "thermal <b>stabilities</b> " of these compounds has been based on the starting tempera-ture of thermolysis (the temperature where DTA, TG or DTG curves begin to deviate from the zero line). In the majority of cases, thermal reactions of the type [MA 6]X 2 ~ [MAsX]X + AT are the objects of study. In these reactions, the volatile ligand is evolved, and the thermal decomposition process may be regarded as a thermally-activated solid-state process of ligand substitution.
