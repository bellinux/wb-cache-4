The destabilising nature of sigma-bonds {{is responsible for}} this. Selective extraction of these <b>sigma-electrons</b> via a sigma-hole on a halogen bond donor shortens and strengthens the metal-metal bond.

40|$|Five basis sets of {{gaussian}} functions {{have been}} developed to calculate magnetic properties of the benzene molecule within the framework of a coupled Hartree-Fock (CHF) approach exploiting the entire D 6 h symmetry. Separate contributions provided by k, sigma and pi-electrons have been evaluated in order to analyze the Pauling-London ring-current model. Our results are at variance with this classical model, as the contribution of k and <b>sigma-electrons</b> to the enhanced out-of-plane magnetic susceptibility is roughly 50 % of the total value. In addition, k electrons provide a de-shielding of proton comparable with that of pi-electrons. The HF limits for electric dipole polarisability, magnetic susceptibility and magnetic shielding of hydrogen and carbon nuclei have been estimated...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the dependence of}} the MgB_ 2 superconducting critical temperature on the pressure. Our model exploits {{the influence of the}} large polarons on the band structure of the layered MgB_ 2 superconductor. Namely, the hole Pekar-Froehlich polarons form quasi two-dimensional potential wells in the boron plane which shift the positions of the sigma- and pi-bands. This energy shift depends on the pressure and the Cooper pairing of the correlated <b>sigma-electrons</b> happens inside polaron wells. The results obtained are as follows: dT_c/dp = -α (5. 2 ± 0. 9) K/GPa or dT_c/dp = -α (6. 9 ± 1. 1) K/GPa for a different choice of the Grueneisen parameter. Being compared with known experimental data they give us a resonable interval for the value of the Froehlich electron-phonon coupling constant: α = 0. 15 - 0. 45.

40|$|Photoinduced charge {{transport}} in 1, 1 -diphenylethene and 2, 3 -diphenylbutadiene functionalized with {{an electron}} donating dimethylamino group and an electron accepting cyano group is reported. UV-spectroscopy reveals {{that in these}} compounds, which incorporate a cross-conjugated spacer, a direct charge transfer transition is possible. It is shown by application of the generalized Mulliken-Hush approach that introduction of an additional branching point in the pi-electron spacer (i. e., when going from the 1, 1 -diphenylethene to the 2, 3 -diphenylbutadiene) leads to only a moderate reduction (68 - 92 %) of the electronic coupling between {{the ground and the}} charge separated state.

40|$|US National Science Foundation [CHE- 105 - 5310, CHE- 105 - 7466]The {{conventional}} {{view that}} the sigma(CC) and sigma(CH) bonds in alkanes and unsaturated hydrocarbons are so highly localized that their non-steric interactions are negligible is scrutinized by the block-localized wavefunction (BLW) method. Even molecules considered conventionally to be "strain free" and "unperturbed" have surprisingly large and quite significant total sigma-BLW-delocalization energies (DEs) due to their geminal and vicinal hyperconjugative interactions. Thus, the computed BLW-DEs (in kcal mol(- 1)) for the antiperiplanar conformations of the n-alkanes (CNH 2 N+ 2, N= 1 - 10) range from 11. 6 for ethane to 82. 2 for n-decane and are 50. 9 for cyclohexane and 91. 0 for adamantane. Although <b>sigma-electron</b> delocalization in unsaturated hydrocarbons usually is ignored, the sigma-BLW-DEs (in kcal mol(- 1)) are substantial, as exemplified by D- 2 h ethylene (9. 0), triplet D- 2 d ethylene (16. 4), allene (19. 3), butadiene (19. 0), hexatriene (28. 3), benzene (28. 1), and cyclobutadiene (21. 1). While each individual geminal and vicinal hyperconjugative interaction between hydrocarbon sigma-bonding and sigma-antibonding orbitals tends to be smaller than an individual p conjugative interaction (e. g., 10. 2 kcal mol(- 1) in anti- 1, 3 -butadiene, the presence of many sigma-hyperconjugative interactions (e. g., a total of 12 in anti- 1, 3 -butadiene, see text), result in substantial total sigma-stabilization energies (e. g., 19. 0 kcal mol(- 1) for butadiene), which may surpass those from the pi interactions. Although large in magnitude, <b>sigma-electron</b> delocalization energies often are obscured by cancellation when two hydrocarbons are compared. Rather than being strain-free, cyclohexane, adamantane, and diamantane suffer from their increasing number of intramolecular 1, 4 -C center dot center dot center dot C repulsions resulting in elongated C-C bond lengths and reduced sigma-hyperconjugation, compared to the (skew-free) antiperiplanar n-alkane conformers. Instead of being inconsequential, sigma-bond interactions are important and merit consideration...|$|R

MS-CASPT 2 (9, 9) /ANO-L calculations reveal that MDB exhibits a low-spill doublet B- 2 (1) ((II) -I- 2) ground state, followed by an open-shell doublet (2) A(2) state with a (2) A(2) -B- 2 (1) gap of 17 +/- 3 kcal mol(- 1).

40|$|The B- 20 (2 -) {{cluster is}} {{predicted}} to exhibit a planar sheet-like structure with a circular circumference. Orbital plots and energy correlations demonstrate the close correspondence between the electronic structure of B- 20 (2 -) and the Bessel functions describing the waves of a quantum mechanical particle confined to a disk. The pi-band of B- 20 (2 -), and its B- 19 (-) congener, contains 12 pi-electrons, forming a (1 sigma) (2) (1 pi) (4) (1 delta) (4) (2 sigma) (2) configuration, which corresponds to a "disk aromaticity" electron count. The analogy not only applies to the a-band, but also extends to the 50 valence <b>sigma-electrons.</b> The occupied sigma-orbitals are assigned {{on the basis of}} radial and angular nodes of the scalar disk waves. The magnetic response of the cluster was examined by Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) values and current density calculations based on the ipsocentric model.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{condensed}} PAHs are examined {{to identify the}} underlying reasons governing empirical Clar's rule taking benzene as a limiting case. It is found that the so-called Clar's structures are the only minima on the MP 2 (fc) potential energy hypersurfaces, meaning that other conceivable valence isomers are nonexistent. The influence of the electron correlation energies to the stability of Clar's structures is substantial with predominating influence of the <b>sigma-electrons.</b> However, the contributions arising from the sigma- and pi-electron correlation energies are approximately the same, if Clar's structures are compared with some artificial pi-electron localized or graphite-like delocalized planar systems. Analysis of the Hartree-Fock (HF) energies provides a compelling evidence that the origin of stability of Clar's structures lies in a decrease of the positive T, V(ee) and V(nn) energy terms relative to some characteristic virtual "delocalized" or "localized" model geometries. Partitioning of the mixed and terms in the sigma- and pi-type contributions, by using the stockholder (SHR), equipartitioning (EQP) and standard pi (SPI) schemes, unequivocally shows that the driving force leading to Clar's structures are more favorable sigma-type interactions. All these conclusions hold for the archetypal benzene too, which could {{be considered as a}} limiting Clar system. Finally, the boundaries of Clar's hypothesis and some common misconceptions are briefly discussed. Perusal of the geometric parameters and pi-bond orders reveals that there are no benzene rings completely "vacant" or "fully occupied" by the pi-electrons, envisaged by Clar in his picture of condensed benzenoid compounds. Instead, there are six-membered rings with higher and lower total pi-electron density. The bond length anisotropy of the former rings is smaller. It is concluded that Clar's proposition is a useful rule of thumb providing qualitative information on the stability of the PAH systems, which in turn should not be overinterpreted...|$|E
40|$|Photoinduced {{reactions}} {{have been}} systematically studied on mass-selected complexes of Mg. + with tri- and tetrasubstituted benzene by F and/or CH 3. The complexes {{fall into two}} groups. The Group I complexes involve bidentate coordination of the o-F atoms to Mg. +, whereas the Group II complexes feature the linkage of Mg. + to {{only one of the}} F atoms. The o-benzyne radical cations were found to be the predominant photolysis products from the Group I complexes, but the yields of the benzyne radical cation products were low for Group II. For each group of complexes, different substituents. including CH 3 (medium <b>sigma-electron</b> donor) and F (strong pi-electron acceptor and weak pi-electron donor), affect the branching ratios significantly. For example, they result in different decomposition thresholds of the o-benzyne radical cations. Through the studies of aromatic substitution, the pathways for the formation and decomposition of o-benzyne radical cations have been brought to light. With the help of quantum mechanics calculations, the observed substitutent effects on the photoformation and decomposition of the o-benzyne radical cations are explained mainly from the energy point of view. We found that although o-benzyne radical cations are formed by the direct abstraction of the F atoms, the formation of m-benzyne radical cations is stepwise, involving a pi-+MgF intermediate...|$|R
40|$|Dewar {{proposed}} the sigma-aromaticity concept {{to explain the}} seemingly anomalous energetic and magnetic behavior of cyclopropane in 1979. While a detailed, but indirect energetic evaluation in 1986 raised doubts-"There {{is no need to}} involve 'sigma-aromaticity',"-other analyses, also indirect, resulted in wide-ranging estimates of the sigma-aromatic stabilization energy. Moreover, the aromatic character of "in-plane", "double". and cyclically de-localized <b>sigma-electron</b> systems now seems well established in many types of molecules. Nevertheless, the most recent analysis of the magnetic properties of cyclopropane (S. Pelloni, P. Lazzeretti, R. Zanasi, J Phys. Chem. A 2007, 111, 8163 - 8169) challenged the existence of an induced a-ring current, and provided alternative explanations for the abnormal magnetic behavior. Likewise, the present study, which evaluates the sigma-aromatic stabilization of cyclopropane directly for the first time, fails to find evidence for a significant energetic effect. According to ab initio valence bond (VB) computations at the VBSCF/cc-PVTZ level, the sigma-aromatic stabilization energy of cyclopropane is, at most. 3. 5 kcal mol(- 1) relative to propane, and is close to zero when n-butane is used as reference. Trisilacyclopropane also has very little sigma-aromatic stabilization, compared to Si 3 H 8 (6. 3 kcal mol(- 1)) and Si 4 H 10 (4. 2 kcal mol(- 1)). Alternative interpretations of the energetic behavior of cyclopropane (and of cyclobutane, as well as their silicon counterparts) are supported.
