40|$|A {{new type}} of car seat has been {{designed}} in which the back-rest is able to move freely in the vertical direction. The design allows the back-rest to follow the vertical vibration {{of the back of}} an occupant of the seat. This is intended to decrease any strain on the lumbar part of the spinal column caused by a different vertical motion at the seat squab and the <b>seat</b> <b>back.</b> The transmission of vertical (z axis) vibration from the base of this seat to the seat surface, to the back-rest and to the backs and heads of seat occupants has been measured. Measurements were made with the <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> fixed, to prevent vertical motion relative to the seat frame, and with the <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> free to move. Vibration transmissibilities from the seat base to the seat surface were characterized by a resonance at frequencies in the region of 4 Hz. The resonance frequencies were slightly higher with the fixed back-rest than with the moving back-rest. The transmissibilities at frequencies above 4 Hz -were generally higher with the fixed back-rest. Measurements with no contact between the seat occupants and the <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> indicated that the dynamic properties of the human body and the seat cushion were less influenced by the moving <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> than by the fixed <b>seat</b> <b>back.</b> Differential motion between the seat surface and <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> was smaller with the moving <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> than with the fixed back. © IMechE 1996. </p...|$|R
5000|$|In 1936, Nash {{introduced}} the [...] "Bed-In-A-Car" [...] feature, which allowed the car's interior {{to be converted}} into a sleeping compartment. The rear <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> hinged up, allowing the rear seat cushion to be propped up into a level position. This also created an opening between the passenger compartment and the trunk. Two adults could sleep in the car, with their legs and feet in the trunk, and their heads and shoulders on the rear seat cushions. In 1949 this arrangement was modified so that fully reclining front <b>seat</b> <b>backs</b> created a sleeping area entirely within the passenger compartment. In 1950 these reclining <b>seat</b> <b>backs</b> were given the ability to lock into several intermediate positions. Nash soon called these new <b>seat</b> <b>backs</b> [...] "Airliner Reclining Seats".|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The stiness of the {{automobile}} <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> mostly aects neck injuries in rear end collisions. The eects of the stiness have been experimentally investigated. A sled simulator was utilized with varying speeds and xed stiness. Another simulation was performed with a xed speed and varying stiness. A stopper was installed behind the <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> to keep a certain stiness. The neck injuries for various cases are calculated equations from industrial standards. Using {{the results of the}} test, the eect of <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> stiness in minimizing occupant neck injury in rear end collisions is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a {{lightweight}} automotive <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> frame structure using CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic). The shape of CFRP <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> frame was determined so that its manufacturing could be performed in a single process without additional fastening. Three different kinds of analyses were performed to confirm that CFRP seat frame could satisfy FMVSS (Federal Motor Vehicle Safely Standards) requirements. The results of finite element analyses showed that its maximum stresses were 51. 1 to 95. 5 % of those of steel seat frame structure. Its mass was 56. 2 % of that of steel <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> frame. CFRP <b>seat</b> frame can provide better fuel economy as well as improved safety...|$|R

5000|$|An {{evaluation}} {{performed by}} NHTSA in 1982 on passenger cars found that [...] "integral" [...] head restraints—a <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> extending {{high enough to}} meet the 27.5 in height requirement—reduces injury by 17 percent, while adjustable head restraints, attached to the <b>seat</b> <b>back</b> {{by one or more}} sliding metal shafts, reduce injury by 10 percent. NHTSA has said this difference may be due to adjustable restraints being improperly positioned.|$|R
