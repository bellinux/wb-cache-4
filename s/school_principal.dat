40|$|Orientation: <b>School</b> <b>principals</b> have an {{important}} role to play in the quality of service delivery in schools. Evidence suggests that <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> are generally poorly compensated, which has an adverse impact on their well-being and subsequent service quality orientation. Research purpose: This study investigated whether rewards are a predictor of well-being and service orientation of <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> in the North-West province. Motivation for the study: Effective <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> are fundamental to the success of any school, which necessitates the establishment of an effective reward and remuneration system. Research design, approach and method: Quantitative research was carried out among <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> (N = 155) in four districts of the North-West province. The Total Rewards Scale, Maslach’s Burnout Inventory – General Survey, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale and the SERVQUAL measure were administered among the principals. Main findings: The results showed that rewards are a significant predictor of the well-being and service quality of <b>school</b> <b>principals.</b> The results further showed that burnout significantly reduces the service quality of <b>school</b> <b>principals.</b> No significant relationships were found between work engagement and the service quality of <b>school</b> <b>principals.</b> Practical/managerial implications: An effective total rewards system enhances the well-being of <b>school</b> <b>principals</b> and, subsequently, their willingness and commitment to delivering quality services. Contribution: The results of this study point out some key elements that need to be considered by the Department of Education to enable quality service delivery in South African schools. </p...|$|R
