5|$|Westland and IBM {{formed a}} {{consortium}} in 1991 {{to perform the}} helicopter's complex <b>systems</b> <b>integration.</b> The AW101 features a network of helicopter management and mission systems designed to reduce pilot workload and enable the helicopter to undertake {{a wide variety of}} missions. A digital automatic flight control system (AFCS) is employed by the AW101. The AFCS allows the operation of a four-axis (pitch, roll, yaw and collective) autopilot and the automatic stabilisation system, and is linked in with the aircraft's flight management systems. The AFCS, manufactured by Smiths Aerospace, is a dual-duplex system using two flight computers to provide redundancy and fault-tolerance.|$|E

40|$|<b>System</b> <b>integration</b> of an {{operation}} center {{has become more}} complex and heterogeneous due to rapid innovations in the IT industry. Problems arise when a new integration requirement emerges due to complexity of the <b>system</b> <b>integration</b> architecture. To simplify the <b>system</b> <b>integration,</b> interoperability has to be emphasized at the design stage. Architectural de sign is the stage wherein the process to identify the interfaces involved in the <b>system</b> <b>integration</b> needs to be considered. Approaches to simplifying <b>system</b> <b>integration</b> via service interface design {{have been the subject}} of many research studies. In this paper, case study on two (2) traffic operation centers in Malaysia i. e. Transport Management Centre of Kuala Lumpur City Hall and Traffic Monitoring Centre of Malaysian Highway Auth ority were conducted to identify gaps amongst the <b>system</b> <b>integration</b> approaches used in both operation centers. Three (3) prominent approaches of <b>system</b> <b>integration</b> used by both operation center s were chosen, explored and discussed, namely, meth od- oriented interface, message-oriented interface and resource-oriented interface. The result of a system atic comparison of the approaches mentioned is also pres ented. Six (6) criteria were established to make comparison on the approaches: interoperability, uniformity, scalability, reusabil ity, heterogeneity, and compatibility. The objective was to determine the best contempor ary approach to service interface design in centralized <b>system</b> <b>integration.</b> The outcome of the evaluation was examined and improvement to the service interface design is proposed. The study is very significant as an attempt to establish a pract ice reference for enhancement of the current system int egration as well as serve as a guide for future deployment of operation centers...|$|R
40|$|Organizations {{often have}} {{information}} systems belonging to different computer generations. These systems contain much valuable {{data to the}} organizations concerned. However, these systems are often unable {{to communicate with each}} other, due to incompatibilities. Moreover, replacing these systems with new systems is also very costly. Therefore the latest trend is integrating the existing systems with each other with the help of different <b>system</b> <b>integration</b> technologies. When the systems are integrated with new technology they bring about various effects to the organizations in concern. The purpose of this thesis is to find out how <b>system</b> <b>integration</b> affects an organization in the photo and home electronics branch, namely Expert. The questions that will be raised in this thesis are how does <b>system</b> <b>integration</b> affect the organization’s work processes and how does <b>system</b> <b>integration</b> affect the organisation’s employees. I have studied how <b>system</b> <b>integration</b> has affected the work processes and employees of the retail stores. In order to find answers to these questions three qualitative interviews were carried out. One interview took place in the central organization and the rest in retail stores in Linköping. There are many reasons, which led Expert towards using <b>system</b> <b>integration.</b> Some of the main reasons are increased profitability and decreased costs for maintenance and upgrading of different systems. Further, the retail stores required better information channelling and streamlining of work processes in order to provide salesmen at retail stores possibility to concentrate more on customers by minimising administrative work. I have found that <b>system</b> <b>integration</b> has affected the organization’s work processes and its employees both positively and negatively, in other words <b>system</b> <b>integration</b> has helped Expert to decrease administration work, provided salesmen at retail stores more time to deliver better service to customers, has automated key work processes saving time and reducing redundancy of work. Even if, the organization is quite satisfied with the benefits the existing <b>system</b> <b>integration</b> technologies have rendered to them, there are many more privileges, which can be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the impacts of modularity‐based {{manufacturing}} practices (MBMP) and manufacturing <b>system</b> <b>integration</b> (MSI) on manufacturing performance (MP) using absorptive capacity as an important enabling factor. Design/methodology/approach: Constructs were developed through a comprehensive literature review. Structural equation modeling was used to test the research model and hypotheses based on a large sample of 303 US manufacturing firms. Findings: Both MBMP and MSI have significant impacts on MP. The positive effects of MBMP on MP are stronger than those of <b>system</b> <b>integration.</b> The absorptive capacity of a firm facilitates better use of modularity practices and <b>system</b> <b>integration.</b> Practical implications: More attention should be given to modularity practices in resource allocation planning. Also, <b>system</b> <b>integration</b> together with modularity practices can generate significantly higher MP. Originality/value: The paper is the first large‐scale empirical study to examine the effects of absorptive capacity on MSI and MBMP, which in turn impacts MP. Furthermore, the findings empirically support that a combination strategy of modularity and <b>system</b> <b>integration</b> can help manufacturing firms to achieve higher performance...|$|R
