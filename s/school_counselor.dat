40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> experienced collaboration with social services and whether they felt they have the ability to improve upon this collaboration. The empirical data consists of qualitative interviews with eight <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> from public <b>schools,</b> ages 13 to 15, in eight separate municipalities in the Stockholm area. The main results showed that the <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> recognized the positive benefits from collaboration, but that they in practice experienced difficulties turning this into a high-quality collaboration. The <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> experienced that due to uncertain expectations in the collaboration it led to unclear distribution of areas of responsibilities. The <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> expressed small or no possibilities for them to improve upon collaboration but pointed out that higher commitment and a positive attitude are valuable attributes to improving collaboration. The results of the interviews were analyzed using the new institutional theory of organization and the role theoretic perspective.

40|$|Although {{providing}} support to underachievers {{has always been}} an important domain of activities of <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> in <b>school,</b> there are almost no studies in our country that focus on the opinion of <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> on the problem of underachievement. The aim of our research was to get acquainted with the meanings that <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> ascribe to underachievement. The points of our interest were how <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> define this phenomenon, how they describe an underachiever and what their experiences in working with these students are. The research sample was convenient and included 34 <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> from 24 secondary schools in Serbia. We used a semi-structured interview, and qualitative thematic analysis was performed on the collected material. Research findings indicate that the majority of <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> define underachievement as the lack of ability or readiness of individuals to respond to the demands set by school. When describing an underachiever a number of <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> speak only about his/her behaviour, while a small number also mention the mechanisms underlying such behaviour. When it comes to their experience in working with underachievers, a considerable number of <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> pointed to the complexity and delicacy of their own role in the process of selection of adequate support strategies. The obtained findings, among other things, suggest that it is necessary that <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> re-examine those personal beliefs about underachieve­ment which can be a serious impediment to solving this problem.
