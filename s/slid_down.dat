5|$|The Frank Slide was a rockslide that buried part of {{the mining}} town of Frank, Northwest Territories, Canada at 4:10 am on April 29, 1903. Over 82 million tonnes (90 million tons) of {{limestone}} rock <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> Turtle Mountain within 100 seconds, obliterating {{the eastern edge of}} Frank, the Canadian Pacific Railway line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest landslides in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the rubble. Multiple factors led to the slide: Turtle Mountain's formation left it {{in a constant state of}} instability. Coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain's internal structure, as did a wet winter and cold snap on the night of the disaster.|$|E
5|$|In November 2010, the Accident Investigation Board Norway {{criticized the}} braking system of the trains. During 2009, there were 83 {{incidents}} where trains with locked wheels <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> steep sections of track. The Accident Investigation Board found that the metro had conducted insufficient testing of {{the braking system}} on steep slippery lines, had not adjusted the brakes satisfactorily, and had not maintained the trains and tracks sufficiently. In December 2010, Oslo Vognselskap ordered another 32 three-car units, bringing the total order up to 115 three-car units. The last trains will be delivered in 2012. There was political disagreement regarding the final purchase, with the Liberal Party and socialist opposition securing a majority for the purchase, while the right-winged parties voted to order 19 units. The extra trains {{will make it possible}} to run all lines except the Holmenkollen Line (Line 1) with six-car lines, compared to a situation with only three-car trains on the Lambertseter Line, the Ring Line and the Kolsås Line (lines 4 and 6) would only use three-car trains.|$|E
5|$|Prior to impact, {{passengers}} did {{not assume}} the brace position. When the airplane came to rest, {{many of the}} passengers in the forward portion of the cabin were upside down, others, who were upright were submerged in water over their heads. Some passengers tried to move from their seats while their seatbelts were still buckled, and other passengers had difficulty locating and releasing their seatbelt buckles because of disorientation. Following the accident, passengers reported fires in the forward left and aft portions of the airplane, including many small fires on the water. Passengers stated that they escaped through large holes in the cabin. The lead flight attendant and first officer escaped {{through a hole in}} the cabin floor near the flight attendant’s position. Several passengers reported assisting others out of the cabin and into the knee-deep water. Many of them walked in the water to the dike, climbed up the wall and over an embankment, and <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> a steep hill to the runway. Others were assisted out of the water by ground personnel.|$|E

50|$|In BASE jumping, when a rapid canopy {{deployment}} is desirable, the slider may {{be constructed}} of mesh, packed {{so that the}} slider is {{at the base of}} the lines and does not inhibit the opening ("slider down") instead of up by the canopy, or removed completely. <b>Slider</b> <b>down</b> and slider off both allow the canopy to open with no resistance and are identical in performance.|$|R
60|$|Another ten minutes, and Jacopo <b>slid</b> rapidly <b>down</b> by the stays, {{and stood}} on the deck with bared head.|$|R
5|$|Bräck {{closed the}} gap with de Ferran over the next fifteen laps as they moved towards slower cars. Bräck got a run on de Ferran and overtook him {{at the bottom of}} the first turn to take over the lead on lap 46, while Andretti lost fourth place to Franchitti on the same lap. Jourdain spun leaving turn four because of his car {{generating}} oversteer, and <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> the frontstretch triggering the second caution on the 50th lap. Franchitti drove to the outside of the track in avoidance. Castroneves avoided hitting Jourdain's car, which remained {{at the bottom of the}} first turn and, though his vehicle lost one of its shock covers, he regained control of his car and continued. Fittipaldi reported to his team that he had a problem with either his gearbox or drivetrain and drove slowly into the pit lane on lap 53 becoming the race's second retirement. The leaders elected to make pit stops on the same lap under caution. Da Matta gained the most positions, moving from sixth to third, and Bräck remained the leader at the lap-57 restart. Bräck pulled away from the rest of the field, until de Ferran {{closed the gap}} between them by the start of the 80th lap.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, when the track was still damp in some sections, Vettel set the fastest {{time of the}} night, a lap of 1:46.660 on super-soft tyres; Webber finished with the second fastest lap. Button drove aggressively and battled Vettel for the fastest time throughout before he ended with the third quickest lap, half a second off Vettel's pace. Alonso, who was fourth fastest, ran wide at turn 17 while on a quick lap and <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> the access road at the next corner; he stalled while attempting to rejoin the track and abandoned his car requiring marshals to push his Ferrari away from the track. Hamilton was fifth, with Barrichello and Massa in sixth and seventh places. The two Mercedes drivers were eighth and tenth; with Nico Rosberg ahead of Schumacher, separated by Kubica. Sutil's Force India was launched into the air when he hit a kerb at the Singapore Sling chicane and his front-left suspension was broken upon landing requiring him to miss half the session, and Alguersuari's left-rear tyre made contact with a barrier but he avoided major damage to his car. Sutil was fined US$10,000 (£6,300) by the stewards because he attempted to drive back to the pit lane in his damaged car and did not stop at a safe position on the circuit.|$|E
5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{momentum}} continued {{one week}} later in Korea, winning his third consecutive race and taking a six-point championship lead as Fernando Alonso finished third. Vettel overcame pole-sitter Mark Webber at the start, and was aided in building up a lead by first-lap contact between Jenson Button, Nico Rosberg and Kamui Kobayashi that saw Button and Rosberg retire with damage from the collision; Rosberg pulled over on the approach to the third turn, forcing a protracted yellow flag period as marshalls attempted to retrieve his car. With the sporting regulations banning overtaking while yellow flags were shown, the field was effectively thinned out in the opening laps as drivers were unable to pass one another. Tyre management {{became the focus of}} the race, as drivers reported heavy graining, particularly on the right-front tyre, which bore most of the load over a lap of the circuit. Vettel ignored six radio calls from his pit wall cautioning him that a tyre failure was imminent, only backing off just enough in the final few laps to secure victory over Webber by six seconds. The team later denied that there had ever been a problem with Vettel's tyres. Further down the order, Scuderia Toro Rosso's Jean-Éric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo fought their way from sixteenth and twenty-first on the grid to finish eighth and ninth, while Romain Grosjean drove a conservative race to finish seventh, having been warned beforehand by the stewards that another first-lap altercation would likely result in his disqualification from the race. Lewis Hamilton's day went from bad to worse when an anti-roll bar on his McLaren failed, while the car handled its tyres so poorly that he was forced to make an unscheduled stop {{in order to make it}} to the finish, only to tear up a length of astroturf that wreaked havoc on his downforce and he <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> to tenth place, narrowly fending off an opportunistic charge from Sergio Pérez to take the final World Championship point on offer. Button's retirement and Hamilton's single point meant that McLaren lost second place in the World Constructors' Championship to Ferrari, and Hamilton admitted that his bid to be the 2012 World Drivers' Champion was over.|$|E
60|$|Clutching at {{the rough}} boards {{literally}} with his finger-nails, he <b>slid</b> slowly <b>down</b> {{toward the edge}} of the roof at a point farthest from the stable.|$|R

25|$|Cryptodomes {{are formed}} when viscous lava is forced upward causing {{the surface to}} bulge. The 1980 {{eruption}} of Mount St. Helens was an example; lava {{beneath the surface of}} the mountain created an upward bulge which <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> the north side of the mountain.|$|E
60|$|The {{headless}} man {{thanked him}} humbly, <b>slid</b> hastily <b>down</b> the bell rope, {{and ran down}} the steps of the tower as if he had left a fire behind him. Then Hans began to ring lustily.|$|R

60|$|He {{was still}} peeping and {{peering into the}} hut, when Thumb pinched his leg to bid him come <b>down.</b> So he <b>slid</b> {{cautiously}} <b>down</b> Thimble's back into the cold moonlight again, and told his brothers all he had seen.|$|R
25|$|Middlesbrough made {{an ambitious}} {{return to the}} Premiership and {{attracted}} expensively-signed big names like Nick Barmby and the Brazilians Juninho and Branco. They went fourth in the Premiership in October 1995, sparking hopes of UEFA Cup qualification, but an injury crisis severely demoralised the side and they <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> the table to finish 12th.|$|E
25|$|On 17 July 2007, Aero República Flight 7330 overran {{the runway}} while landing at Simón Bolívar International Airport in Santa Marta, Colombia. The E190 <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> an {{embankment}} {{off the side}} of the runway and came to rest with the nose in shallow water. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair, but all 60 aboard evacuated unharmed.|$|E
25|$|On May 7, 2017, John Thorton Jenkins, a 32-year-old {{experienced}} climber from Seattle, WA {{was heading}} for the summit when he <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> steep terrain near the Hogsback. He sustained serious injuries and was treated by search and rescue teams, who had him flown to a Portland hospital, but he was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.|$|E
25|$|He {{was voted}} WPBSA Newcomer of the Year and WSA Young Player of the Year in 1999. Tipped by many pundits as a {{potential}} champion of the game, Fu's subsequent performance was disappointing, and he <b>slid</b> back <b>down</b> the rankings.|$|R
60|$|A {{string of}} loaded cars <b>slid</b> out <b>down</b> the track, {{and a string}} of empties took their place. Bales, crates, boxes, jars, carboys, frails, cases, and {{packages}} flew into them from the freight-house as though the cars had been magnets and they iron filings.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. That's my name, Mus' Dan,' he said, hurrying {{over the}} silent shining lawn, where a rabbit {{sat by the}} big white-thorn near the croquet ground. 'Here you be.' He strode into the old kitchen yard, and <b>slid</b> them <b>down</b> as Ellen came to ask questions.|$|R
25|$|The {{biggest threat}} {{to the lives of}} the tsar and his family, however, came not from terrorists, but from a {{derailment}} of the imperial train in the fall of 1888. Maria and her family had been at lunch in the dining car when the train jumped the tracks and <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> an embankment, causing the roof of the dining car to nearly cave in on them.|$|E
25|$|On 31 January 2007, Laiho <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> {{the lane}} at {{a bowling alley}} after accidentally {{stepping}} over the foul line. He slammed hard into the wall, breaking his left shoulder. This rendered him unable to play guitar for six weeks. Due to this incident, Children of Bodom was forced to cancel their first 2007 tours and a festival that they were slated to headline.|$|E
25|$|Mark Martin {{dropped out}} on lap 160 with a blown engine. He {{was the first}} of the six {{championship}} contenders to drop out, and his chances for the title were over. After a strong first half, Harry Gant <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> the standings, and he too fell out of contention for the title. Kyle Petty was still running at this point, but was nay a factor. The title would be settled between Allison, Elliott, and Kulwicki.|$|E
60|$|Then, as before, the Raja <b>slid</b> deftly <b>down</b> the trunk, {{and hurried}} {{to the aid of}} his son, who in {{obedience}} to orders, had fixed his grasp upon the Vampire's neck. Then, too, as before, the Vampire, laughing aloud, slipped through their fingers and returned to its dangling-place.|$|R
50|$|At 12:55 p.m., rookie A. J. Foyt IV was {{attempting}} to become the youngest driver ever {{to qualify for the}} Indy 500. On his first lap, he spun exiting turn 2, did not hit the wall, and <b>slid</b> backwards <b>down</b> nearly {{the entire length of the}} backstretch. He was uninjured.|$|R
60|$|The deck, as I have said, {{was at a}} very stiff cant. His Excellency sat <b>down,</b> <b>slid</b> to leeward, and {{was asleep}} again.|$|R
25|$|While {{attempting}} the pickup, a Chinook {{transport helicopter}} crashed {{in the darkness}} at 10:09 PM when the rear rotor hit a tree, and the helicopter <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> the slope and over a cliff, exploding in flames and killing all the crew and passengers. There was an element of ABLE Troop 3-71 CAV 2nd Platoon still left on the PZ after the crash that worked relentlessly to recover the bodies of their 10 comrades and destroy sensitive equipment left among the wreckage.|$|E
25|$|The train's {{speed at}} the time of {{derailment}} was an estimated 65–70km/h. The F 1200 locomotive was the first to derail, sliding down the embankment until it came to rest on its right side on the road below. The cars between the locomotive and the dining car were completely destroyed while the dining car partially <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> the embankment towards the road, ending up at a 45° angle on the slope between the embankment and the road. The last two cars remained standing on the tracks.|$|E
25|$|Remarkably for an {{unsuccessful}} car, in his only ever race, Marcus Winkelhock started last at the European Grand Prix at the Nürburgring but after getting his tactics {{right at the}} start of the wet race (by changing tyres after the warm up lap), Winkelhock found himself leading the race with a 33-second lead after just two laps due to most of the field either pitting for wet tyres or spinning off. The race was stopped due to the dangerous conditions. Winkelhock officially led the race for 7 laps but as the conditions improved following the restart, he <b>slid</b> <b>down</b> the field in his uncompetitive car and eventually retired after 15 laps.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was given}} good playing time in [...] by the Cowboys, playing in 116 games, but his batting average <b>slid</b> further <b>down,</b> to [...]216, but {{the season was}} not uneventful. On June 13, he hit for the cycle, and {{he was given the}} {{managerial}} reins, which lasted 58 games and 21 wins.|$|R
60|$|During {{the rest}} of that day and the whole of that night did the brig remain fixed on the berg. Early next morning the ice began to move. It eased off, and the vessel <b>slid</b> gently <b>down</b> the slope on which she had been forced, and was re-launched safely into the water.|$|R
