5|$|A <b>special</b> <b>election</b> was {{scheduled}} for January 19, 2010, for the U.S. Senate seat from Massachusetts left vacant by Kennedy's death. Shortly before his death, Kennedy had written to Democratic Governor of Massachusetts Deval Patrick and the Massachusetts legislature to change state law to allow an appointee to fill a U.S. Senate vacancy, for a term expiring upon the <b>special</b> <b>election.</b> (Kennedy had been instrumental in the prior 2004 alteration of this law to prevent Governor Mitt Romney from appointing a Republican senator should John Kerry's presidential campaign succeed.) The law was amended, and on September 24, 2009, Paul G. Kirk, former Democratic National Committee chairman and former aide to Kennedy, was appointed to occupy the Senate seat until {{the completion of the}} <b>special</b> <b>election.</b> Kirk announced {{that he would not be}} a candidate in the <b>special</b> <b>election.</b> In that election, Republican State Senator Scott Brown won the seat in a stunning upset, ending Democratic control of it going back to 1953.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{the death}} of U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, Massachusetts state law {{triggered}} a <b>special</b> <b>election</b> {{to be held in}} January 2010. On September 4, 2009, a representative for Lynch took out nomination papers to run in the <b>special</b> <b>election.</b> After speaking with his family and citing the short time frame in which to conduct a campaign, Lynch decided against seeking the Democratic nomination for the seat.|$|E
5|$|Again {{unable to}} get his {{expanded}} gambling proposal past the Senate, Beshear attempted to chip away at the Republican majority in that chamber by appointing some Republican senators to lucrative positions in the executive and judicial branches {{in advance of the}} 2010 General Assembly. Shortly after the special session, Beshear named Republican senator Charlie Borders to the state Public Safety Commission. That appointment set up a <b>special</b> <b>election</b> for Borders' seat, which was won by Democratic senator Robin Webb, reducing the Republican majority to 20â€“17 with one Independent who usually voted with the Republicans. Following Webb's victory, Beshear appointed Republican senator Dan Kelly to a circuit judgeship, but Republicans held on to that seat in a <b>special</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E

5|$|Brown and Erie County Democratic Party {{chairman}} Leonard Lenihan were at odds over {{various political}} positions after Lenihan {{played a major}} role in Brown's election to the office of mayor. Brown supported Andrew Cuomo for New York Attorney General in the 2006 general election, David Paterson for Lieutenant Governor of New York in the 2006 general election and Antoine Thompson for 60th District New York Senator in a <b>special</b> <b>election</b> on February 28, 2006. Lenihan disagreed with each of these choices. Thompson had run Brown's last common council campaign, and Brown was upset that he did not get to select his successor in the 60th District. Many supporters considered boycotting the <b>special</b> <b>election</b> due to a perceived racial slight against an African American who seemed to be wrongfully shutout of the process. Lenihan pointed out that neither of the previous state senators turned mayor, Anthony Masiello and James D. Griffin, was granted the right to pick their successor, and he noted that Thompson had not been timely in entering the <b>special</b> <b>election</b> process. The Erie and Niagara County Democratic committees bypassed Thompson as their nominee in favor of Marc Coppola despite Brown's backing in the February <b>special</b> <b>election.</b> Thompson subsequently decided to run for the New York Senate seat in the November general election.|$|E
5|$|Following the Supreme Court ruling, Taylor fled to Indianapolis, Indiana, fearing {{he would}} be implicated in Goebel's assassination. Beckham became acting governor, {{but because of the}} unusual {{circumstances}} surrounding the election, a <b>special</b> <b>election</b> was held November 6, 1900, to determine who would complete Goebel's unexpired term. Beckham (now of age) won the election over Republican John W. Yerkes by fewer than 4,000 votes. Shortly following the <b>special</b> <b>election,</b> Beckham married Jean Raphael Fuqua of Owensboro. The couple had two sons.|$|E

5|$|If {{the office}} of the mayor becomes vacant with one year or less {{remaining}} in the term, the city council appoints a person to fill the vacancy. If the vacancy occurs with more than one year remaining, the city council is obligated to call a <b>special</b> <b>election.</b> The candidate with the majority of the votes in the <b>special</b> <b>election</b> is declared mayor. If no candidate receives a majority, a special run-off must be held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes. While the mayor's office is vacant pending a <b>special</b> <b>election,</b> the president of the city council serves as the interim mayor, with limited powers, until a new mayor is elected. If for any reason a Mayor serves a partial term of two years or more, it will count as one full term.|$|E

5|$|On April 4, 1991 H. John Heinz III, {{one of the}} US Senators from Pennsylvania, {{was killed}} when his {{chartered}} plane collided with a helicopter inspecting its landing gear. Under the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the legislature of each state {{has the power to}} permit the governor to fill the vacant seat until a <b>special</b> <b>election</b> can be held. In Pennsylvania, this power had been delegated, and Governor Robert P. Casey signed a writ on May 13, 1991, declaring November 5 the date for a <b>special</b> <b>election</b> and temporarily appointing Harris Wofford to fill Heinz's now-vacant seat. Under Pennsylvanian law, {{there was no need for}} a primary in such a situation; instead, both the Democrats and Republicans would each internally select their candidate, who would run in the <b>special</b> <b>election.</b> John S. Trinsey Jr., a member of the Pennsylvanian electorate and potential candidate, challenged the constitutionality of this law, claiming that it violated his rights under the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments.|$|E

5|$|One of Barack Obama's first {{decisions}} as president-elect was to appoint Hillary Clinton, US Senator from New York and former Democratic presidential primary opponent, as Secretary of State; Clinton resigned her Senate seat {{to take the}} position. The district's seat became vacant in January 2009 when Governor David Paterson appointed Gillibrand to the United States Senate to replace Clinton. On February 23, 2009, Governor Paterson issued a proclamation setting the date for the <b>special</b> <b>election</b> as March 31, 2009. Under state law, Paterson was not required to issue a proclamation for a <b>special</b> <b>election</b> until July 2010.
