25|$|In Scandinavian mythology, Huld is only {{referenced}} by völva or seiðkona, {{that is a}} {{woman who}} practiced the seiðr. She is mentioned in the Ynglinga saga, Sturlunga saga and a late medieval Icelandic tale. In the latter <b>source,</b> <b>she</b> is Odin's mistress and the mother of the demi-goddesses Þorgerðr and Irpa. As her name suggests, Huld may be in origin the same being as the Huldra and the German Holda.|$|E

5000|$|In Germanic mythology, Frigg (Old Norse), Frija (Old High German), Frea (Langobardic), and Frige (Old English) is a goddess. In {{nearly all}} <b>sources,</b> <b>she</b> is {{described}} as {{the wife of the}} god Odin. In Old High German and Old Norse <b>sources,</b> <b>she</b> is also connected with the goddess Fulla. The English weekday name Friday (etymologically Old English [...] "Frīge's day") bears her name.|$|R

500|$|Victoria's great-great-granddaughter Queen Elizabeth II {{viewed the}} film in a special screening; {{according}} to one <b>source,</b> <b>she</b> believed the film had a [...] "lot of good points", but was unhappy with the change to the assassination attempt, and also thought the British officers' costumes looked too German. Apart from the assassination attempt, historian Alex von Tunzelmann noted that [...] "historically, [...] not at all bad", and especially praised the depiction of contemporary politics and the characteristics Friend put into his performance as Prince Albert.|$|E
500|$|At age 15 {{her cousin}} and {{eventual}} husband started courting her, {{but she was}} too young to be interested in boys and preferred sweets. At age 20, incipient cataracts were discovered when she suffered a major episode of conjunctivitis. After marriage at 21, her husband's wealth made it possible for Calment never to have to work. They led an active life including fencing, cycling (at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence), tennis, [...] swimming, rollerskating at Alyscamps ("I fell flat on my face"), and playing the piano and making music with friends. In the summer, the couple would stay at Uriage for mountaineering up to the glacier ("Even at 16 I had good legs"). She also went hunting with her husband in the hills of the Provence to shoot rabbits and wild boars. Her husband introduced her to smoking, offering cigarettes after a meal, but it was not her passion. ("After the meal, after just one, I'd had enough of it".) Calment smoked cigarettes from the age of 21 (1896) to 117 (1992). According to one <b>source,</b> <b>she</b> smoked no more than two cigarettes per day and it is not known whether she inhaled, whereas an earlier medical source states that she smoked cigars with her husband before changing to cigarettes more recently.|$|E
500|$|Upworth (Callie Hernandez) is a medic serving {{aboard the}} Covenant and Ricks' wife. She {{is the first}} crew member to imply a {{collective}} crew-hesitancy over returning to hypersleep after the ship's computer [...] "Mother" [...] locates the Denver song transmission's <b>source.</b> <b>She</b> stays aboard the Covenant with Tennessee and Ricks while the excursion team ventures down {{to the surface of}} the Engineer home world. When Tennessee takes the ship down to within eighty kilometers of the ionic storm, Upworth protests alongside her husband. After Tennessee receives word about the expedition's casualties and insists that the Covenant be brought down within forty kilometers of the ionic storm, putting the ship in jeopardy, Upworth protests again. However, she has a change of heart and cooperates with Tennessee by initiating the command override, allowing the ship to get dangerously close. After the survivors return to the Covenant, Upworth provides a rudimentary treatment for Lope's acid burns, though she admits he will need reconstructive surgery. Upworth and Ricks have sex in the shower, but are interrupted when a stowaway Alien prods Upworth between her legs with its tail and kills Ricks, covering her in blood. The Alien kills her in the shower immediately afterwards.|$|E

2500|$|Current Affairs {{journalist}} Adam Patterson {{called the}} book [...] "One {{of the more}} intelligent, incisive mass-market books on ISIS." [...] Patterson emphasized, [...] "The central value of Nance’s work is ultimately written into its title. Defeating ISIS outlines that the jihadi group can, with intelligent application of diplomatic and counterinsurgency methods, be eventually defeated." [...] Rachel Maddow referenced this book as a <b>source</b> <b>she</b> used to educate herself about ISIS. The book received a negative review by Paul Monk in The Australian. Monk criticized the writing style, and disputed Nance's view that ISIS wished [...] "to destroy Islam". The Guardian national security reporter Spencer Ackerman praised the author's expertise, citing the caliber of his works The Terrorists of Iraq and Defeating ISIS.|$|E

60|$|Towards {{six o'clock}} she alighted, at Surbiton station, {{deciding}} {{that this would}} be the quickest way of getting to Wimbledon. She paced the platform slowly, as if resigned, but her heart was crying out at the great injustice of delay. Presently the local train came in. She had planned to buy a local paper at Wimbledon, and if from that <b>source</b> <b>she</b> could learn nothing, she would go on to his house and inquire. She had prearranged everything minutely.|$|E
60|$|But this {{proposition}} did {{not at all}} suit Elizabeth's book. Her great object had been to conceal Mr. Davies's desires as regards Beatrice from her father, and her daily dread was that he might become acquainted with them from some outside <b>source.</b> <b>She</b> knew very well that if her father {{went up to the}} Castle to borrow money it would be lent, or rather given, freely enough; but she also knew that the lender would almost certainly take the opportunity, the very favourable opportunity, to unfold his wishes as regards the borrower's daughter. The one thing would naturally lead to the other--the promise of her father's support of Owen's suit would be the consideration for the money received. How gladly that support would be given was also obvious to her, and with her father pushing Beatrice on the one side and Owen Davies pushing her on the other, how could Elizabeth be sure that she would not yield? Beatrice would be the very person to be carried away by an idea of duty. Their father would tell her that he had got the money on this undertaking, and it was quite possible that her pride might bring her to fulfil a bond thus given, however distasteful the deed might be to her personally. No, her father must at all hazards be prevented from seeking assistance from Owen Davies. And yet the money must be had from somewhere, or they would be ruined.|$|E
60|$|He {{was with}} Mary, of course, that evening, walking again {{along the banks}} of the Lurwell, as they had first done now nearly twelve months since. Then the autumn had begun, and now the last of the summer months was near its close. How very much had {{happened}} to her, or had seemed to happen, during the interval. At that time she had thrice declined Harry Gilmore's suit; but she had done so without any weight on her own conscience. Her friends had wished her to marry the man, and therefore she had been troubled; but the trouble had lain light upon her, and as she looked back at it all, she felt that at that time there had been something of triumph at her heart. A girl when she is courted knows at any rate that she is thought worthy of courtship, and in this instance she had been at least courted worthily. Since then a whole world of trouble had come upon her from that <b>source.</b> <b>She</b> had been driven hither and thither, first by love, and then by a false idea of duty, till she had come almost to shipwreck. And in her tossing she had gone against another barque which, for aught she knew, might even yet go down from the effects of the collision. She could not be all happy, even though she were again leaning on Walter Marrable's arm, or again sitting with it round her waist, beneath the shade of the trees on the banks of the Lurwell.|$|E

According to one <b>source,</b> <b>she</b> soon died, but according to another <b>source</b> <b>she</b> became the owner of a kvass pub (kvass is a popular Russian rural drink made out of bread or grains) and entertained the local Sakhalin residents.|$|E
