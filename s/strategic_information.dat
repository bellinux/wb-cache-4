During the war, the OSS supplied policymakers with facts and estimates, but the OSS never had jurisdiction over all foreign intelligence activities.

25|$|Prisoners {{who were}} thought to possess {{significant}} technical or <b>strategic</b> <b>information</b> were brought to specialist intelligence-gathering facilities at Fort Hunt, Virginia or Camp Tracy, California. After arriving in these camps, the prisoners were interrogated again, and their conversations were wiretapped and analysed. Some of the conditions at Camp Tracy violated Geneva Convention requirements, such as insufficient exercise time being provided. However, prisoners at this camp were given special benefits, such as high quality food and access to a shop, and the interrogation sessions were relatively relaxed. The continuous wiretapping at both locations may have also violated {{the spirit of the}} Geneva Convention.|$|E

One communication included information about a prototype German Bomber that he obtained from a captured British pilot. Her job as secretary to Stewart Menzies of British counterintelligence, allowed a speedy relay of information through Menzies to Field Marshal Douglas Haig. Attempts were made to extract Conrad and the pilot to London, but these failed and Conrad remained in Augustabad.|$|E
25|$|The Pacific Patrol Boat Program {{has also}} {{provided}} benefits to Australia and New Zealand. These nations enjoy an improved strategic {{presence in the}} region, and the naval advisors supplied to operating nations create personal networks within those nations, while improving the skill set {{and knowledge of the}} Pacific-class operators. These advisors regularly interact with officials from agencies outside the normal scope of diplomats, and can obtain political and <b>strategic</b> <b>information</b> inaccessible through other avenues. The naval advisors also allow the military-operated vessels to maintain links to larger naval forces. The ability for the operating nations to provide their own humanitarian support likewise reduces the need for Australian and New Zealand assets to become involved in relatively small-scale incidents.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{awareness}} by practitioners, academics and regulators that managing strategic risks is critical to organizational success. One approach that has been suggested to improve strategic risk management is integrating <b>strategic</b> risk <b>information</b> within <b>strategic</b> performance management systems (SPMS), such as the balanced scorecard (BSC). While recent survey evidence has found that managers use SPMS to respond to changes and uncertainties in the external environment (e. g., Chenhall 2005; Widener 2007), {{there has been little}} investigation of the impacts that integrating <b>strategic</b> risk <b>information</b> in SPMS has on managers strategy-related judgments. This thesis aims to empirically examine the effect of integrating <b>strategic</b> risk <b>information</b> in the BSC on managers strategy evaluations and strategy recommendations. Specifically, this thesis compares the judgmental effects of integrating <b>strategic</b> risk <b>information</b> in the BSC to presenting strategic risks in a risk register separate to the BSC, and the moderating role of different strategic risk profiles (that is, whether the strategy is exposed to high strategic outcome risks or high strategic input risks). Based on the results of an experiment, this thesis shows that when <b>strategic</b> risk <b>information</b> is integrated in the BSC, managers make less favorable strategy evaluations and strategy recommendations for a strategy with high strategic input risks than one with high strategic outcome risks. However, managers strategy evaluations and strategy recommendations are not influenced by these different strategic risk profiles when <b>strategic</b> risk <b>information</b> is presented in a risk register separate to the BSC. This thesis contributes to the literature by being {{one of the first to}} investigate the effect of strategic risks on managerial judgments. The findings also demonstrate that integrating <b>strategic</b> risk <b>information</b> in SPMS, such as the BSC, has potential beneficial effects in enabling managers to distinguish between strategic risks that have differential impacts on a strategy...|$|R

40|$|In {{the higher}} {{education}} sector, a number of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are playing {{a leading role in}} promoting sustainable initiatives. Effectively managing these initiatives however can be a complex task and requires data and information from multiple aspects of operations. In an HEI, operating sustainably means ensuring financial sustainability, social sustainability, environmental sustainability and educational sustainability. In order to manage sustainability effectively, HEIs require an integrated tool that can provide information on all areas of sustainability. HEIs face a number of challenges in effectively managing sustainability information, such as siloed data and information, and poor sharing and communication of information. Business Intelligence (BI) can assist in overcoming many of the challenges faced by organisations in effectively managing <b>strategic</b> sustainability <b>information.</b> This study investigates both the constraints to effective sustainability information management and the challenges of BI. A BI framework to support effective <b>strategic</b> sustainability <b>information</b> management is proposed. Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) is one such HEI, which is affected by the challenges of managing <b>strategic</b> sustainability <b>information.</b> NMMU is therefore used as a case study in this research. A BI solution, Sustainable BI, was developed based on the proposed framework. The main goal of sustainable BI is to provide strategic management at NMMU with a tool that can provide integrated sustainability information that can assist in overcoming the challenges in effectively managing <b>strategic</b> sustainability <b>information.</b> Sustainable BI was evaluated by strategic management at NMMU who are responsible for managing sustainability at NMMU. The evaluation took place through a usability study. The study revealed to what extent Sustainable BI could effectively manage <b>strategic</b> sustainability <b>information</b> at NMMU. The BI framework was iteratively improved on {{based on the results of}} the evaluations. The contributions from this study are a model for sustainability management, a BI Framework to support <b>strategic</b> sustainability <b>information</b> management and a BI solution, Sustainable BI...|$|R

In this paper a tested and confirmed model used to explain <b>strategic</b> IT- and <b>information</b> security is described. The model has been iteratively developed and applied in development, implementation or training in five different organizations. In these five cases, senior management awareness {{and understanding}} of <b>strategic</b> IT- and <b>information</b> security was verified as being very low. The model was originally developed to explain IT- and information security to corporate senior management. It has been adapted for use in the public sector by changing some of the terminology to match that used within the public sector. The model may also be used for training purposes, with regards to senior management or personnel in <b>strategic</b> IT- and <b>information</b> security. The importance of senior management ownership and care for strategic elements of the organization’s security programme is also discussed and the conclusion drawn is that the operative levels should be coordinated by one or a few members of the senior management team...|$|R
