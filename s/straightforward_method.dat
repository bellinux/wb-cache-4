40|$|Two {{powerful}} and <b>straightforward</b> <b>methods</b> are presented for probing the Majorana nature and CP violation of neutralinos at future e + e − linear colliders. The search for supersymmetry (SUSY) {{is one of}} the main goals at present and future colliders as SUSY is generally accepted as one of the most promising concepts for physics beyond the Standard Model [1]. A characteristic feature of SUSY theories is the presence of neutralinos ˜χ 0, the spin– 1 / 2 Majorana superpartners of the neutral gauge and Higgs bosons. The neutralinos are expected to be among the light supersymmetric particles that can be produced copiously at future high–energy colliders. Once several neutralino candidates are observed at such high–energy collider experiments it will be crucial to establish the Majorana nature and CP properties of neutralinos as well as to reconstruct the fundamental SUSY parameters [2].
