50|$|In Western Australia <b>structure</b> <b>plans</b> are {{commonly}} prepared at subregional, district and local levels. Typically, subregional <b>structure</b> <b>plans</b> are informed by higher level policy and strategy and deliver sufficient information to identify areas {{that should be}} excluded from development, guide the planning of major infrastructure and the broadscale zoning of land at the regional level. Similarly, district <b>structure</b> <b>plans</b> are informed by relevant policies and strategies, any subregional <b>structure</b> <b>plan</b> and by any detailed engineering of major infrastructure affecting that district. Local <b>structure</b> <b>plans</b> repeat this process {{to the level of}} local roads, land subdivision, sites for community facilities, parks, utilities, etc. in order to inform the final phase of road and infrastructure construction and the zoning of the land.|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{conventional}} Straight Line (SL) wind flow dominates research into wind loads on structures. Most structure design takes into account only research into SL flow. Few researchers have studied tornado forces on buildings and attempted to distinguish between tornadic wind loads and SL flow loads. Using a computer simulation, this research addresses and distinguishes between the tornadic forces and SL forces on structures. In the numerical simulation, tornado forces and SL forces will be compared on large <b>structure</b> <b>plan</b> areas and on thin <b>structure</b> <b>plan</b> areas. Additionally this research investigates how {{the increase in the}} vortex strength (α) affects tornado forces on a cubic structure. The large <b>structure</b> <b>plan</b> areas are dimensionalized by the structure height: (1 h x 1 h, 2 h x 2 h, 4 h x 4 h and 8 h x 8 h) where h is 20. 3 (m) and tornado maximum radius (rmax) is 61 (m). The <b>structure</b> <b>plan</b> areas are a multiple of factor two. The thin <b>structure</b> <b>plan</b> areas are obtained by dividing the large <b>structure</b> <b>plan</b> areas by a factor of ten. This research has three key findings. First, when the same maximum reference velocity (Vtrans.) was used and when the large <b>structure</b> <b>plan</b> area characteristic length was approximately twice the tornado maximum diameter, the force and pressure coefficients had the same values as Straight Line (SL) flow. Second, the thin <b>structure</b> <b>plan</b> areas are more likely collapse faster {{in the presence of a}} tornado compared to SL flow due to the high differentials pressure in tornado between the windward wall and the leeward wall. In addition, on the thin <b>structure</b> <b>plan</b> areas, the tornado force coefficients were twice the SL flow force coefficients. The final key finding is that when the vortex strength (α) increased, the tornado force coefficients increased exponentially...|$|R

50|$|Chapter 3: GeopoliticsGeopolitical risk affects {{financial}} markets, corporate activity, and governments. These {{risks are}} more difficult to analyze because of their long duration, analytical bias, and the complexity of feedback loops and interacting risks. The first step in analyzing geopolitical risks is identifying risks through information gathering and early warning systems. Processing and analyzing this information correctly requires the use of different analytical frameworks and theories. Companies can mitigate geopolitical risks through keeping an open mind, having a nimble organizational <b>structure,</b> <b>planning</b> for vastly different scenarios, and purchasing political risk insurance.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} model of {{military}} technology competition among states. States can choose to introduce new military technology, mimic rivals' level of technology, or withdraw from the contest. States can choose to implement any level of technology within their current feasible technologies. We find that states with significant technological leads should sometimes withhold new technologies, only strategically releasing them to trump rivals' efforts. We develop the model by refining Admiral Jackie Fisher's roughly articulated concept of 'plunging'. We then use this refined argument to reanalyze the case of naval rivalries among European powers between the Crimean War and the First World War. Finally, we conclude by discussing the model's implications for current US military force <b>structure</b> <b>planning.</b> technology diffusion, quolitative arms races, conventional force <b>structure</b> <b>planning,</b> weapons development,...|$|E

The goals-achievement matrix was not presented by its originator [...] M Hill [...] as an entirely unambiguous method. It can be interpreted as a set of significantly diverging variants which are used here for three purposes: to show that economists' critique of GAM is too general, to clarify the connections between GAM and other well-known evaluation methods, and to discuss how GAM could best be structured for use in local participatory planning. ...|$|E

40|$|Green <b>structure</b> <b>planning</b> has mainly been an {{instrument}} for urban planning {{as well as for}} developing and managing urban green spaces and green structures. This paper explores the potential of green <b>structure</b> <b>planning</b> for urban-rural integration in landscape development. This is studied for the case of a municipality-wide planning project in Ronneby, southern Sweden. Applying a policy and governance “arrangement model”, the paper investigates the social and inclusive dimensions of the proposed planning approach. The working method for developing Ronneby’s green structure plan has been highly participatory, aimed at creating a visionary document in which the respective qualities of rural and urban areas are mutually strengthening. Walk-and-talks were arranged with local “connoisseurs” across the municipality for identifying the most important places, routes, and landmarks in their respective village and it’s surrounding. These connoisseurs, in this case representatives from local associations, helped explore whether the green <b>structure</b> <b>planning</b> instrument can also contribute to a sense of belonging, strengthening the relations between people and their everyday landscape at a municipal level. Results show that a collaborative planning process supported a broad learning process on green structure by the involvement of the local connoisseurs, municipal staff and politicians. The long time span and repeated meetings were important for raising awareness of the potential in visionary green structure plans. Findings not only support the continued municipal planning process; they also contribute to the current debate on how “green infrastructure” can be applied as an interdisciplinary concept covering e. g. green space spatial pattern, aesthetic values, biological diversity, and ecosystem services...|$|E
