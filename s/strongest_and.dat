5|$|A study {{commissioned}} by Experian rated Trafford as the <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> most resilient borough in North West England {{to dealing with}} sudden changes in the economy. Trafford's low reliance on vulnerable businesses in the current recession and its high proportion of multinational companies were two factors which give the borough its high ranking.|$|E

5|$|By 6May, a {{total of}} five light {{aftershocks}} had occurred near the earthquake's epicenter. Of the five, the first registered a magnitude of 3.7(ML) and struck about 15 minutes after the main shock, and was succeeded by a magnitude 3.9(ML) tremor at 10:09 local time. Two similar quakes of minor intensity struck the region the next day; however, the <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> final aftershock registered a magnitude of 4.1(ML) and occurred at 04:00 in the morning.|$|E
5|$|Cannon {{in general}} have {{the form of}} a {{truncated}} cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an explosive charge and a projectile. The thickest, <b>strongest,</b> <b>and</b> closed part of the cone is located near the explosive charge. As any explosive charge will dissipate in all directions equally, the thickest portion of the cannon is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward motion of the cannon as its projectile leaves the bore is termed its recoil and the effectiveness of the cannon can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of the cannon means decreased mobility.|$|E
5|$|Famous authors {{include some}} of the world's most studied and praised writers. William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe defined England's Elizabethan period. The British Romantic {{movement}} {{was one of the}} <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> most recognisable in Europe. The poets William Blake, Wordsworth and Coleridge were amongst the pioneers of Romanticism in literature. Other Romantic writers that followed these figure further enhanced the profile of Romanticism in Europe, such as John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron. Later periods like the Victorian Era saw a further flourishing of British writing, including Charles Dickens and William Thackeray.|$|E

5|$|Harald {{was born}} in Ringerike, Norway in 1015 (or {{possibly}} 1016) to Åsta Gudbrandsdatter and her second husband Sigurd Syr. Sigurd was a petty king of Ringerike, and among the <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> wealthiest chieftains in the Uplands. Through his mother Åsta, Harald {{was the youngest of}} King Olaf Haraldsson's (later Saint Olaf) three half-brothers. In his youth, Harald displayed traits of a typical rebel with big ambitions, and admired Olaf as his role model. He thus differed from his two older brothers, who were more similar to their father, down-to-earth and mostly concerned with maintaining the farm.|$|E
5|$|The {{predictions}} made by Diem and Ely {{were extremely}} inaccurate. There had been heavy fighting in northern Vietnam, where the Vietminh {{were at their}} <b>strongest,</b> <b>and</b> many people {{had been forced to}} abandon their homes. Although French charities had been operating in the north, the refugee camps were disorganised and were able to provide little more than shelter. As a result, there was a great number of northerners who wanted to leave and start a new life in the south.|$|E
5|$|The <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> deadliest {{hurricane}} of {{the season}} tracked from east of the Lesser Antilles, through the Greater Antilles, and across the southeastern United States before last being observed near Newfoundland; it was tied for having the longest duration for a hurricane prior to 1870. When it hit near Panama City, Florida with winds of 115mph (185km/h), it caused at least 23deaths, including five when a lighthouse was destroyed. Many houses were destroyed along its path, primarily along the Florida Panhandle.|$|E

The storm devastated southwestern Louisiana in early August, especially Cameron Parish, leaving 34fatalities and approximately $5million (1918USD) in damage. In late August, the season's third tropical storm damaged portions of coastal North Carolina, causing up to $15,000 in damage. Although the fifth tropical storm or its extratropical remnants caused only minor impacts on land in Bermuda and Atlantic Canada, 21people drowned after two ships {{were caught in the}} storm.|$|E
5|$|The tobacco {{industry}} in North Korea is substantial, with 53,000 hectares (2.3 {{percent of its}} arable land) dedicated to tobacco cultivation. This is the fourth-highest percentage of arable land dedicated to tobacco in the world, with the annual output exceeding 80,000 tonnes, making North Korea {{one of the top}} 25 tobacco worldwide producers. This is despite 31% of North Koreans being malnourished. The best, <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> most expensive tobacco comes from the north of the country near the border with China.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} types of thunderstorms: single-cell, {{multi-cell}} cluster, multi-cell lines, and supercells. Supercell thunderstorms are the <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> most severe. Mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the tropics and subtropics can {{be responsible for the}} development of hurricanes. Dry thunderstorms, with no precipitation, can cause the outbreak of wildfires from the heat generated from the cloud-to-ground lightning that accompanies them. Several means are used to study thunderstorms: weather radar, weather stations, and video photography. Past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the 18th century. Beyond the Earth's atmosphere, thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and, probably, Venus.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Vera, {{also known}} as the , was an {{exceptionally}} intense tropical cyclone that struck Japan in September1959, becoming the <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> deadliest typhoon on record to make landfall on the country. The storm's intensity resulted in damage of unparalleled severity and extent, and was a major setback to the Japanese economy, which was still recovering from World War II. In the aftermath of Vera, Japan's disaster management and relief systems were significantly reformed, and the typhoon's effects would set a benchmark for future storms striking the country.|$|E
5|$|Women {{were among}} the most ardent. In some {{municipalities}} the women organized themselves into women's sections and in others even in exclusively female Fasci. The <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> most numerous presence of women was in the Fascio of Piana degli Albanesi, where over a thousand of the 3,500 members were women in a town of 9,000 inhabitants. For the Fasci the women abandoned the Church, but not the religious sentiment, to protest against the priests, who had tried to frighten them and isolate them with the threat of excommunication. In Piana the women organised a boycott of annual religious procession in protest of the priest’s opposition to the movement in 1893.|$|E
5|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} {{season in the}} national league in 2011, where it did not qualify for the following season's continental tournaments, Atlético finished as runner-up in the 2012 Campeonato Brasileiro, qualifying for the Copa Libertadores {{for the first time}} in twelve years. The team entered the competition in the second stage, and was drawn into Group 3, together with Argentine club Arsenal de Sarandí, Bolivia's The <b>Strongest,</b> <b>and</b> São Paulo once again. With a squad composed of Ronaldinho, Jô, Diego Tardelli, Bernard and a returning Gilberto Silva, Atlético dominated the group, winning its first five matches. São Paulo inflicted the team's only loss in the last match, but Atlético had already secured the best performance of the competition's group stage, which meant the second legs in further rounds would be played at home. São Paulo, as the worst runner-up of the group stage, was also the team's opponent in the round of 16. Atlético won the first leg, played at the Morumbi, after a 21 comeback; in the second leg, played at the Estádio Independência (the club's new first-choice home ground since the previous year), the team won 41 with a hat-trick by Jô to advance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract.

We present a complete picture of {{the complexity of}} all these problems. In particular, we show that <b>strong</b> <b>and</b> weak simulation preorder (and hence simulation equivalence) is EXPTIME-complete between PDA/BPA and finite-state systems in both directions. For PDA the lower bound even holds if the finite-state system is fixed, while simulation-checking between BPA and any fixed finitestate system is already polynomial. Furthermore, we show that weak (<b>and</b> <b>strong)</b> bisimilarity between PDA and finite-state systems is PSPACE-complete, while <b>strong</b> (<b>and</b> weak) bisimilarity between two PDAs is EXPTIME-hard. ...|$|R

5|$|As {{expected}} from periodic trends, lanthanum {{has the largest}} atomic radius of the lanthanides and the stable group 3 elements. Hence, {{it is the most}} reactive among them, tarnishing slowly in air and burning readily to form lanthanum(III) oxide, La2O3, which is almost as basic as calcium oxide. A centimeter-sized sample of lanthanum will corrode completely in a year as its oxide spalls off like iron rust, instead of forming a protective oxide coating like aluminium and lanthanum's lighter congeners scandium and yttrium. Lanthanum reacts with the halogens at room temperature to form the trihalides, and upon warming will form binary compounds with the nonmetals nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, selenium, silicon and arsenic. Lanthanum reacts slowly with water to form lanthanum(III) hydroxide, La(OH)3. In dilute sulfuric acid, lanthanum readily forms the aquated tripositive ion : this is colorless in aqueous solution since La3+ has no f electrons. Lanthanum is the <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> hardest base among the lanthanides and group 3 elements, which is again {{expected from}} its being the largest of them.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of June24, Hurricane Celia {{intensified}} into a powerful Category5 storm, further solidifying it as the strongest of the 2010 Pacific hurricane season. At its peak, the cyclone attained winds of 160mph (260km/h) along with a minimum pressure of 921mbar (hPa; 27.2inHg). This ranks it as the second-strongest June hurricane on record, {{as well as the}} eleventh-strongest in the basin, and the second known Category5 to develop during the month on record. The <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> first known storm of this intensity in June was Hurricane Ava in 1973. Additionally, it also marked the first time on record that two consecutive seasons featured Category5 hurricanes, with Hurricane Rick in October 2009 reaching this intensity, the second time two consecutive seasons had a category 5 hurricane was when hurricanes Marie and Patricia formed in 2014 and 2015 respectively. In the National Hurricane Center's monthly tropical weather summary for June 2010, it was stated that the accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) for the month was the highest on record, most of which is attributed to Hurricane Celia.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Betsy was the <b>strongest</b> <b>and</b> {{most devastating}} storm of the season. Extensive damage from Betsy was {{reported}} in the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana, particularly the New Orleans area. It was the first hurricane {{in the history of the}} United States to result in at least $1billion (1965USD) in losses. Hurricane Carol meandered in the eastern Atlantic for over two weeks from mid-September to very early October. Impact on land from Carol was minimal. In late September, Tropical Storm Debbie developed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea and moved slowly across the region, before later reaching the Gulf of Mexico. The storm dissipated just offshore of Louisiana, which resulted in only minor impact along the Gulf Coast of the United States. The final tropical cyclone, Hurricane Elena, formed on October12. Elena remained at sea for nearly a week and caused no damage on land. Collectively, the storms of the 1965Atlantic hurricane season caused 76fatalities and $1.45billion in damage, almost entirely due to Hurricane Betsy.|$|E
