40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of Transglutaminase (TG) on the physicochemical, microbiological and sensory properties of <b>strained</b> <b>yoghurt.</b> <b>Strained</b> <b>yoghurt</b> samples were produced with four different enzyme concentrations; C (Control), T 1 (0. 74 Unit TG g - 1 protein), T 2 (1. 29 Unit TG g - 1 protein) and T 3 (1. 85 Unit TG g - 1 protein). The samples were evaluated regarding chemical composition, proteolysis, texture profile, viscosity, water holding capacity, microbiological counts and sensory properties. Cross linking of milk proteins by TG enzyme improved the physical properties of the yoghurts before straining. Surprisingly the textural parameters of the strained yoghurts were not affected by the enzyme but the water holding capacity was improved. Higher treatments of the TG enzyme decreased the proteolytic activity and acidity with increasing storage time. On the contrary enzymatic cross linking had no significant effect on the microbiological properties and the sensory attributes were not unfavorable affected...|$|E

Yoghurt fermented to pH 4. 6 {{was also used}} for preparing <b>strained</b> <b>yoghurt.</b> Yoghurts were stored at 4 degreesC for up to 4 weeks. Analysis of AFM(1) in milk, yoghurt, <b>strained</b> <b>yoghurt</b> and yoghurt whey was carried out using immunoaffinity, column extraction and liquid chromatography coupled with fluorometric detection. AFM(1) levels in yoghurt samples showed a significant decrease (p < 0. 01) compared with those initially added to milk. Growth of culture lactic acid bacteria was not affected in the AFM(1) contaminated yoghurts, {{with the exception of}} Streptococcus thermophilus that showed a significantly (p < 0. 01) lower increase in the yoghurt containing the toxin at high concentration. Following fermentation, AFM(1) was significantly lower (p < 0. 01) in yoghurts with pH 4. 0 than in yoghurts with pH 4. 6 at both contamination levels. During refrigerated storage, AFM(1) was rather more stable in yoghurts with pH 4. 6 than with pH 4. 0. The percentage loss of the initial amount of AFM(1) in milk was estimated at about 13 and 22 % {{by the end of the}} fermentation, and 16 and 34 % by the end of storage for yoghurts with pHs 4. 6 and 4. 0, respectively. The percentage distribution ratio of AFM(1) in strained yoghurt/yoghurt whey of the initial toxin present in the yoghurt was about 90 / 10 and 87 / 13 for the lower and the higher contamination levels, respectively...|$|E

The results showed that total aerobic mesophilic bacterial counts decreased during storage at both temperatures. Yeast and mould counts, however, increased especially in the samples stored at room temperature due to increased acidity during storage. The number of aerobic spore-forming bacteria decreased, although it was high {{at the beginning of}} storage. The number of psychrotrophic bacteria significantly decreased after 60 days in the samples stored at refrigeration temperature and to a smaller degree decreased in the samples stored at room temperature. The statistical analysis showed that the variety of milks and draining of the yoghurts and their interactions had no effect on the growth/survival of total aerobic mesophilic bacteria and psychrotrophic bacteria (P? 0. 05). However, storage time had a significant effect on the growth of aerobic mesophilic bacteria and aerobic spore-forming bacteria (P< 0. 01) and yeast, mould and psychrotrophic bacterial counts (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Large {{quantities}} of serum are produced during the <b>strained</b> <b>yoghurt</b> manufacturing process, {{which is the}} predominant type of yoghurt in Greece. However, the exploitation of this by-product as an alternative source of energy, protein and mineral elements in animal diets {{has not yet been}} examined. Therefore, this experiment was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} dietary yoghurt serum supplementation on growth performance and antioxidant status in sheep. Fourty eight male 2 months old lambs of Chios breed were randomly assigned to three experimental groups; control group was fed with a commercial basal diet, whereas the other two groups consumed the same diet, with the only difference that concentrated feed was uniformly supplemented with two levels of yoghurt serum powder (YS 1 : 25 g/kg feed or YS 2 : 50 g/kg feed). Lambs were weighed in a weekly basis from the beginning until the end of the experiment and blood samples were collected to measure antioxidant status. No significant effect of yoghurt serum powder on growth performance of fattening lambs was demonstrated, even after 28 days of dietary supplementation (P> 0. 05). At the same time, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in blood plasma were not significantly different among the experimental groups (P> 0. 05) and no incidents of lambs with diarrhea were recorded.

40|$|Streptococcus thermophilus is a {{commonly}} used starter bacterium in dairy industry. It reduces the pH of milk rapidly and equilibrates the medium {{for the growth}} of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus during yoghurt fermentation. Efforts to increase the diversity of artisanal yoghurt starters are not only important to bring new strains with novel and desirable characteristics, but also for the preservation of natural diversity which diminishes with the overuse and spread of industrial starters to natural resources. In the present study, 14 artisanal yoghurt samples were processed for the isolation of promising <b>strains</b> for <b>yoghurt</b> starter culture production and 66 strains were subsequently characterized. They were all identified as S. thermophilus using species-specific PCR and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing.

40|$|Interest in the {{microbiota}} {{of traditional}} fermented dairy products, such as yoghurt, continues {{due to the}} need for new lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains that can complement or replace currently-in-use starters. In this work, five traditional yoghurts and one milk sample (for making yoghurt) from different areas of the Khorasan-e-Razavi region, Iran, were subjected to microbial characterization. Among the 102 isolates recovered, which included 29 from milk, the thermophilic LAB species Streptococcus thermophilus (34) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii (36) (with similar numbers of the subsp. bulgaricus and lactis) were the majority bacteria in all samples. Wide intra-species phenotypic and genetic diversity was encountered among the isolates. The safety and technological features of 29 strains belonging to the species S. thermophilus, L. delbrueckii and Lactobacillus helveticus, all candidates for use in yoghurt-making, were examined. In culture, two S. thermophilus strains produced the biogenic amine histamine from histidine (its precursor amino acid), and five L. delbrueckii strains showed atypical resistance to tetracycline (MIC ≥  8  μg mL). The remaining strains coagulated milk, producing a coagulum of good appearance and pleasant acidic aroma. None of them produced appreciable amounts of exopolysaccharides in milk under the incubation conditions. After fermentation of milk with individual and mixed <b>strains,</b> major <b>yoghurt</b> aroma volatile compounds (i. e. acetaldehyde, diacetyl and acetic acid) were detected. Also as being used in the design of commercial starters, the thermophilic LAB strains characterized in this study might be used to help improve the safety of traditional yoghurts, while maintaining their original qualitative and sensorial characteristics.

40|$|Proto-cooperation between Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus {{is one of}} the {{key factors}} that {{determine}} the fermentation process and final quality of yoghurt. In this study, the interaction between different proteolytic strains of S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricuswas investigated in terms of microbial growth, acidification and changes in the biochemical composition of milk during set-yoghurt fermentation. A complementary metabolomics approach was applied for global characterization of volatile and non-volatile polar metabolite profiles of yoghurt associated with proteolytic activity of the individual strains in the starter cultures. The results demonstrated that only non-proteolytic S. thermophilus (Prt-) strain performed proto-cooperation with L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. The proto-cooperation resulted in significant higher populations of the two species, faster milk acidification, significant abundance of aroma volatiles and non-volatile metabolites desirable for a good organoleptic quality of yoghurt. Headspace SPME-GC/MS and 1 H NMR resulted in the identification of 35 volatiles and 43 non-volatile polar metabolites, respectively.

AIM: To study the effects of fermented milk containing Bifidobacterium animalis DN- 173 010 and <b>yoghurt</b> <b>strains</b> on the IBS in a multicentre, double-blind, controlled trial. METHODS: A total of 274 primary care adults with constipation-predominant IBS (Rome II) were randomized to consume for 6 weeks either the test fermented milk or a heat-treated yoghurt (control). HRQoL and digestive symptoms were assessed after 3 and 6 weeks on an intention-to-treat population of 267 subjects. RESULTS: The HRQoL discomfort score, the primary endpoint, improved (P < 0. 001) in both groups at weeks 3 and 6. The responder rate for the HRQoL discomfort score was higher (65. 2 vs. 47. 7 %, P < 0. 005), as was the decrease in bloating score [0. 56 +/- (s. d.) 1. 01 vs. 0. 31 +/- 0. 87, P = 0. 03], at week 3 in the test vs. the control group.

Yoghurts have pH values between 3. 95 - 4. 23, viable S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus numbers were determined between 10 - 10 cfu/g for yoghurts producing with starter culture, 10 - 107 8 5 6 cfu/g and 10 - 10 cfu/g for yoghurts producing with traditional methods, respectively. Coliforms, E. coli, yeast 6 7 and mould counts have at low numbers for all yoghurt samples. As the result, yoghurts which are produced by starter cultures have high numbers of yoghurt bacteria means that yoghurts produced by using starter cultures have higher therapeutic and/or antimicrobial properties beside of their organoleptic characteristics.

40|$|Streptococcus thermophilus is an {{important}} dairy starter used for the manufacture of fermented milks and cheeses. As for many other lactic acid bacteria, its survival during propagation and preservation of starter cultures and its performance in dairy fermentations are significantly affected by its {{ability to cope with}} many environmental stresses. This, in turn, is dependent on the expression of a several genes, which is often controlled by negative response regulators, and has complex relationships with the control of metabolism. In this paper we describe the effect of growth phase, adaptation and inactivation of genes for stress response regulators (hrcA, ctsR and rr 01) on the growth, acid production and stress resistance and intracellular protein patterns in the <b>yoghurt</b> <b>strain</b> S. thermophilus Sfi 39. Inactivation of stress response regulators significantly affected growth, acid production in milk and stress tolerance. Although mutants showed an increased resistance during the exponential phase compared to the wild type strain, the effect of the mutations was complex and in some cases mutants were unable to mount an acid- or heat-shock response after exposure to mild heat and acid stresses. Significant differences in intracellular protein patterns analyzed by SDS-PAGE and 2 -DE/mass spectrometry were found as a function of growth phase, adaptation and mutation, but a detailed transcriptomic and proteomic study would be needed to provide a mechanistic interpretation of the effect of the mutations and to identify a strategy for the construction of food-grade mutants with improved growth and performances...|$|R
