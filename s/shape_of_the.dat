30|$|A {{comparison}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mode <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> each draft pad in {{the draft}} gear with mode <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> an individual draft pad is done.

This is because the draft pads housed in the draft gear have their own individual behaviour which cumulatively results in different mode <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> draft gear. These mode <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> draft gear as such have no resemblance with mode <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> an individual draft pad.|$|R
5|$|As can be {{seen from}} the diagram, the unusual <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Paragon made it very {{complicated}} to build.

5|$|Collisions {{occur when}} two galaxies pass {{directly}} through {{each other and}} have sufficient relative momentum not to merge. The stars of interacting galaxies will usually not collide, but the gas and dust within the two forms will interact, sometimes triggering star formation.

5|$|During the {{following}} decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated {{by a large}} number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001 several experiments, most notably BOOMERanG, found the <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe to be spatially almost flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies.|$|E
5|$|Fish such as Dascyllus aruanus have bold {{disruptive}} {{patterns on}} their sides, breaking up their outlines with strong contrasts. Fish like Heniochus macrolepidotus have similar bands of colour that extend into fins projecting {{far from the}} body, distracting attention from the true <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fish.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of a PPF, {{opportunity}} cost {{is directly related to the}} <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curve (see below). If the <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PPF curve is a straight-line, the opportunity cost is constant as production of different goods is changing. But, opportunity cost usually will vary depending on the start and end points. In the diagram on the right, producing 10 more packets of butter, at a low level of butter production, costs the loss of 5 guns (shown as a movement from A to B). At point C, the economy is already close to its maximum potential butter output. To produce 10 more packets of butter, 50 guns must be sacrificed (as with a movement from C to D). The ratio of gains to losses is determined by the marginal rate of transformation.|$|E

5|$|It is {{believed}} that the Lānai hookbill inhabited montane dry forests on Lānai dominated by akoko (Euphorbia species) and ōpuhe (Urera glabra). The unique <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hookbill's bill, particularly {{when compared with the}} ōū's bill, and its apparent rarity suggested that the species was an extreme specialist and was therefore restricted to this habitat.|$|E
