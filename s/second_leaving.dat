5|$|As {{the pairs}} go their {{separate}} ways, an enforcer for the loan shark {{catches up with}} the duplicated pair {{to get the money}} back and they discover they have no cash. The enforcer orders Brian to decide whether he kills him or Stewie. Brian initially refuses to choose but when he panics, he tells the enforcer to shoot Stewie in the head, killing him, then the enforcer tells Brian to give him the money he and Stewie borrowed and leaves the room. Meanwhile, the real pair worry about getting caught Stewie suggest that they make a run for it and head home, but Brian fears it will endanger the family. Stewie suggests that perhaps they should kill themselves and Brian reluctantly agrees. They prepare to throw themselves off the top balcony of the hotel but Stewie chickens out at the last <b>second,</b> <b>leaving</b> Brian to fall to his death. A panic-stricken Stewie trips over his backpack and finds the money the other pair had won.|$|E

Alonso topped the timesheets on day two, edging Barrichello into <b>second</b> <b>leaving</b> Button third, as the drivers completed 74 laps between them. On the final day, Button topped once again, two-tenths clear of Rosberg with Nelson Piquet, Jr. and Lewis Hamilton further behind.|$|E
25|$|With a three run lead, Orosco {{took the}} hill {{for the ninth}} facing {{the top of the}} Red Sox order. Ed Romero, who {{replaced}} Spike Owen at shortstop, was retired on a foul pop. Boggs then grounded out to Backman at <b>second,</b> <b>leaving</b> Marty Barrett as the last hope for the Red Sox. Orosco worked a 2-2 count before getting Barrett to swing and miss to end the game and the series, with the Mets taking the deciding game 8-5. The win went to McDowell, with Schiraldi taking his second consecutive loss. Orosco recorded his second save.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November {{was against}} Derby County at the newly built Pride Park Stadium. They were awarded a penalty {{kick in the}} first half after Patrick Vieira was fouled by Lee Carsley; Wright hit the penalty, which ricocheted off the goal crossbar. Two goals by Paulo Wanchope and a late strike by Dean Sturridge {{condemned}} Arsenal to their first defeat of the league season. Arsenal played Manchester United on 9 November 1997 and needed a win to stay one point behind the league leaders. Wenger admitted in his pre-match comments that a second successive defeat would make it [...] "difficult" [...] for them to catch Manchester United, but not [...] "impossible". Striker Nicolas Anelka, standing in for Bergkamp, scored his first goal for Arsenal and Vieira added a <b>second,</b> <b>leaving</b> goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel rattled. Although Teddy Sheringham scored twice for Manchester United to level the score, midfielder David Platt headed into the far corner with seven minutes left of the match to score the winner for Arsenal. Wenger said of the win: [...] "This result is good for the English game because it will stimulate interest in the Premier League" [...] and opposing manager Alex Ferguson half agreed: [...] "A one-horse race is not good for the game." [...] Arsenal failed to capitalise on the result, losing to Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool, in a period where the team were depleted due to injuries.|$|E
2500|$|UNC held a lead of 10 {{points or}} more {{for most of the}} second half and were leading by 10 points until 2:09 when Duke's Tyler Thornton hit a 3-point shot quickly {{followed}} by another 3 by Seth Curry to close the margin to 4. [...] With just 14 seconds left in the game, Tyler Zeller accidentally tipped the ball into the Duke basket on a Duke 3-point shot by Ryan Kelly. Duke was awarded 2 points on the tip in by Zeller leaving Carolina with a 1-point lead. Duke's Tyler Thornton fouled Zeller who made his first shot but missed his <b>second</b> <b>leaving</b> Carolina with a 2-point lead. [...] Duke brought the ball up court following the defensive rebound off Zeller's missed free throw and Duke guard Austin Rivers hit the game-winning 3 as time expired. Rivers finished the game with a career high 29 points, including six three-pointers.|$|E
2500|$|Free of {{his foot}} injury, Chanderpaul enjoyed the best series {{of his career}} to that point when he scored centuries {{in three of the}} five Test matches against India. In {{addition}} to his centuries, he also scored three half-centuries, and batted for a record 1,513 minutes between dismissals. The following year, against Australia, Chanderpaul scored a century from 69 balls – which at the time was the third fastest Test century. Later in that same series, the two sides scored exactly the same total in their respective first innings, and Australia then reached 417 in their <b>second,</b> <b>leaving</b> West Indies requiring 418 runs to win. No side had ever successfully chased that many runs to win in a Test previously; writing for Cricinfo, Andrew Miller reported {{at the end of the}} third day that [...] "Victory [...] is as unlikely as ever, but it remains a remote possibility." [...] On the final two days, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Chanderpaul—batting with a broken finger—both reached centuries, and the West Indies completed the record run-chase with three wickets remaining. He subsequently suffered what ESPNcricinfo described as [...] "an indifferent run"; despite scoring centuries against South Africa and Bangladesh, he averaged just over 35 across eighteen innings, of which six were against either Bangladesh or Zimbabwe. Facing England at Lord's, Chanderpaul narrowly missed out on a century in both innings in July 2004. He remained not out on each occasion, scoring 128 runs in the first innings, and 97 in the second, but the West Indies were beaten by over 200 runs in the contest.|$|E

2500|$|Rookie Phillies pitcher Marty Bystrom {{was sent}} out by manager Dallas Green to face veteran Nolan Ryan. [...] The rookie {{gave up a}} run {{in the first inning}} but then held the Astros at bay until the sixth inning. [...] The Astros lead did not last long as Bob Boone hit a two-out single giving the Phillies the lead in the second. [...] The Astros tied the game in the sixth with an Alan Ashby single that brought home Denny Walling. [...] Houston took a 5 – 2 lead in the seventh, but the Phillies came back in the eighth with a single by Larry Bowa, a ground ball that [...] Ryan was not able to handle thus killing a chance for a double play, then a {{textbook}} but by Greg Gross to load the bases. Ryan had pitch great ball in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh innings striking out six and holding the Phillies to just the two runs they had scored in the second. [...] Now it was Ryan versus Rose. With the count 3–2, Rose fouled on off. [...] Ryan then threw a costly ball four that allowed Bowa to score. [...] Rose had won the battle and Ryan was pulled for Joe Sambito. The Phillies scored on a force at <b>second</b> <b>leaving</b> men on the corners and one out. Ken Forsch was brought in by Astros manager Bill Virdon to face Schmidt. [...] Forsch struck out Schmidt for the second out of the inning. Forsch gave up a single letting another run score to tie the game 55. Manny Trillo the shocked the Astros and their fans when he tripled to left scoring two runs and giving the Phillies a 75 lead. The Astros came back in the eighth to rough up Tug McGraw for four single and two runs that were scored with two-outs. With the game tied 77 the two teams went to extra innings for the fourth straight game. The winner would advance to the World Series. Garry Maddox had the hit of his career when he doubled in Del Unser with one out to give the Phillies an 87 lead. That would be all they needed as the Astros failed to score {{in the bottom of the}} tenth.|$|E
60|$|And, {{to prove}} that they were right, the gap between the two scores began {{gradually}} to be filled up. Dencroft's struggled hard, but the School House total crept up and up. Maybury brought it to six by winning the high jump. This was only what had been expected of him. The discomforting part of the business was that the other two places were filled by Morrell, of Mulholland's, and Smith, of Daly's. And when, immediately afterwards, Maybury won the weight, with another School House man <b>second,</b> <b>leaving</b> Dencroft's with third place only, things began to look black for the latter. They were now only one point ahead, and there was the mile to come: and Milligan could give any Dencroftian a hundred yards at that distance.|$|E
