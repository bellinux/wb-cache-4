500|$|When Jackson {{began the}} Off the Wall project {{he was not}} <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted as the final result; however, {{he did not want}} another record that sounded like The Jacksons, but rather he wanted more {{creative}} freedom, something he had not been allowed on prior albums. Jackson's father Joseph also approved of the project and allowed him to record it on the condition that it didn't interfere with group business. Despite his brothers' desire to work with him, Jackson wanted to make the album independently of his family. Nevertheless, his brother Randy still contributed percussion to [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough".|$|E
500|$|By his own admission, Gravel was too new and [...] "too abrasive" [...] to be {{effective}} in the Senate by the usual means of seniority-based committee assignments or negotiating deals with other senators, and was sometimes seen as arrogant by the more senior members. Gravel instead relied upon attention-getting gestures to achieve what he wanted, hoping national exposure would force other senators to listen to him. As part of this he voted with Southern Democrats to keep the Senate filibuster rule in place, and accordingly supported Russell Long and Robert Byrd but opposed Ted Kennedy in Senate leadership battles. In retrospective assessment, University of Alaska Anchorage history professor Stephen Haycox would say, [...] "Loose cannon is a good description of Gravel's Senate career. He was an off-the-wall guy, and you weren't really ever <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would do." ...|$|E
2500|$|National Interest 's {{review of}} his {{biography}} goes on with Foccart's admission that the French secret services eliminated the Cameroonian Marxist leader Félix-Roland Moumié in 1960. Furthermore, it quotes [...] "some reports" [...] which [...] "suggested that Foccart and Houphouët {{spoke on the}} phone every Wednesday, {{and there is no}} doubt that he considered the Ivoirian leader the African centerpiece of his network. They operated together on a number of issues. Interventions such as that in Gabon in 1964 and Chad in 1969 were encouraged by the Foccart-Houphouet tandem. The most significant collaboration between Foccart and Houphouet was the way they tried to persuade de Gaulle to back the Biafran secession from Nigeria in 1967. Despite the pressures they exerted, however, de Gaulle refused to recognize Biafra, and, in retrospect, so guarded and elliptical are some of Foccart's statements that one cannot be <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> really wanted or expected from de Gaulle at the time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Other {{than what}} is learned of his {{character}} from the novels themselves, very {{little is known about}} Perry Mason. [...] His family, personal life, background, and education are not depicted, although according to the first chapter of The Case of the Sleepwalker's Niece (1935), his astrological sign was Leo. Mason has a professional relationship with Paul Drake, although after The Case of the Velvet Claws fees are seldom discussed. Della Street is Mason's only (unacknowledged) romantic interest. It is known that he lives in an apartment because he is occasionally awakened from sleep to go to his office; he does not entertain anyone at home. His tastes in food are known because many scenes take place in restaurants, and that he is an excellent driver is shown by his participation in the occasional car chase. Other than those sketchy facts, there is so little physical description of him that the reader is not even <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> looks like.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the reasons}} Judge Garrity {{took so long to}} deliver his {{decision}} in this case was because he wanted to make <b>sure</b> that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> decided was backed up by legal precedent.|$|R

60|$|THE EMPEROR. And now, my friends, though I do not, as you see, fear this lion, yet {{the strain}} of his {{presence}} is considerable; for {{none of us can}} feel quite <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> will do next.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Strether, [...] "I'm not {{altogether}} <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thinks. I'm {{not sure of}} anything that concerns him, except that the more I've seen of him the less I've found him what I originally expected. He's obscure, and that's why I'm waiting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Celia said God didn't mind poor clothes, and {{she took}} me when I looked worse than you do. I always go in the morning; she likes to have me," [...] said Ben, turning his hat about as if not quite <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> ought to do.|$|E
5000|$|Referring to [...] "Coma White" [...] and [...] "Great Big White World" [...] Manson {{told the}} Los Angeles Times, [...] "The color white comes up a lot. It kind of {{represents}} {{to me the}} numbness I had. That numbness is manifested in drugs...in {{all the people who}} want to suck the life out of you when you become a rock star." [...] One analysis held that the song [...] "describes a girl that Manson loved and compares the girl to a drug, so the singer isn't <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> on or whom he's in love with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well now, {{it appears}} to me," [...] rejoined Bones, [...] "that the man seems pretty <b>sure</b> of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> believes, and very {{reasonable}} in <b>what</b> <b>he</b> says, but I don't {{know enough about the}} subject to hold an opinion as to whether it's true or false." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{not much}} at any rate. But he baffles me; one day I think him a perfect numskull, {{and the next}} he makes such a show of the small drop of {{scholarship}} he has that I'm not <b>sure</b> but <b>what</b> <b>he</b> may be a genius." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, drily, [...] "that's {{rather more}} than I know, but I have {{a notion that}} his {{difficulty}} is he isn't quite <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would be at. Now, the man who does one thing at one time, and all with the same purpose, {{is the one who}} generally gets there first." ...|$|E
60|$|Domingo had a {{good deal}} to say, and framed it cunningly, playing upon the dislike of the white men that was in those who heard him, but as Ormsgill noticed, it was the old man of lighter color he chiefly watched. The latter sat silent and motionless, {{regarding}} him with expressionless eyes, until he ceased, and Ormsgill realized that if it depended upon {{the opinion of the}} assembly Domingo had won his case. Still, though he was by no means <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would do, he was, at least, determined it should not depend on that, and there was a trace of grimness in his smile when Nares turned to him.|$|E
60|$|With {{a sudden}} {{determination}} as new {{to him as}} it was incomprehensible, Reddy turned from her and struck forward {{in the direction of}} the hill. He was not quite <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was going for. Yet that he, who had only a moment before fully determined to leave the rancho and her, was now going to her father to demand her hand as a contingency of his remaining did not strike him as so extravagant and unexpected a denouement as it was a difficult one. He was only concerned HOW, and in what way, he should approach him. In a moment of embarrassment he hesitated, turned, and looked behind him.|$|E
6000|$|... "He won't {{take the}} chance," [...] said Dick. [...] "Remember, <b>he</b> isn't <b>sure</b> of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is doing, and all {{railroad}} men {{like to keep}} out of trouble. If he made a mistake, the passenger might sue the railroad company for big damages, and get them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} would. I am {{not at all}} <b>sure</b> but <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would wish to have the will found. If he did, we could begin and go through every book in the library. We would begin with the sermons, and soon know whether it be as I have suggested." ...|$|R
5000|$|Monette, {{a middle-aged}} {{traveling}} book salesman (his first name is never given), goes to confession. When the priest asks him <b>what</b> sin <b>he</b> has committed, Monette admits {{that while he}} believes he has sinned in some way, he is not entirely <b>sure</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is guilty of. He then explains {{the events of the}} preceding days.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can guess}} that I didn't think {{about trying to}} save myself from being {{scratched}} by the thorns on the raspberry bushes; but dug out as quick as any rabbit ever did in this world, and oh, what a row I found going on! It seems that the 'Squire had caught sight of Mr. Fox, and, thinking it was me, dove down on him without stopping to make <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was tackling, burying his claws so deep that he couldn't pull them out in a hurry. Just at that very minute Mr. Weasel, who sure enough had heard me yelling, sneaked up, and there's no need of saying {{that he made a}} spring for the 'Squire, catching him by the neck.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{returning}} to the cabin they found Allie had left her room. From appearances Neale concluded {{that she had made}} little use of the things he had brought her. He was conscious of something akin to impatience. He was not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did feel. The situation had subtly changed and grown, all in that brief talk with Slingerland. Neale slowly walked out toward the brook, where he expected to find her. It struck him suddenly that if she had watched for him all week and had run when he came, then she must have wanted to see him, but was afraid or shy or perverse. How like any girl! Possibly in the week past she had unconsciously grown a little away from her grief.|$|E
6000|$|In a {{subsequent}} passage of Dr. Wace's article (p. 356) he {{adds to the}} list of the verities which he imagines to be unassailable, [...] "The Story of the Passion." [...] I am not quite <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> means by this. I am not aware that any one (with the exception of certain ancient heretics) has propounded doubts as to the reality of the crucifixion; and certainly I have no inclination to argue about the precise accuracy of every detail of that pathetic story of suffering and wrong. But, if Dr. Wace means, as I suppose he does, that that which, according to the orthodox view, happened after the crucifixion, and which is, in a dogmatic sense, {{the most important part of}} the story, is founded on solid historical proofs, I must beg leave to express a diametrically opposite conviction.|$|E
60|$|To make <b>sure</b> of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing, Anderson Rover held several {{consultations}} with Captain Barforth, and Bahama Bill was closely questioned regarding {{the location of}} Treasure Isle. The old tar stuck to the story he had told so often, and went over numerous maps with {{the commander of the}} steam yacht.|$|R
6000|$|... "By all means. But you've got {{to prove}} he has them first, and the doctor won't dare to say {{anything}} to Plum until <b>he</b> is <b>sure</b> of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is doing. Otherwise, Plum's father could raise a big row, and he might even sue the doctor for defamation of character, or something like that." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{signs of}} mental {{confusion}} in his talk had so distressed me, that I {{had not been}} composed enough to feel <b>sure</b> of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> really meant, until he described himself as [...] "shrinking from a necessary explanation." [...] Hearing those words, my knowledge of the circumstances helped me; I realized what his situation really was.|$|R
6000|$|He went direct to Mrs Pipkin's house. When he {{made that}} half promise of {{marriage}} in Mrs Pipkin's hearing, he had {{said that he would}} come again on the morrow. This he had not done; but of that he thought nothing. Such breaches of faith, when committed by a young man in his position, require not even an apology. He was admitted by Ruby herself who was of course delighted to see him. 'Who do you think is in town?' she said. 'John Crumb; but though he came here ever so smart, I wouldn't so much as speak to him, except to tell him to go away.' Sir Felix, when he heard the name, felt an uncomfortable sensation creep over him. 'I don't know I'm <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> should come after me for, and me telling him as plain as the nose on his face that I never want to see him again.' ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} in the world that Maria Port was afraid of except her father, and of him {{personally}} she had not the slightest dread. But of his dying without leaving her the whole of his fortune she had an abiding terror, which often kept her awake at night, and which sent a sickening thrill through her whenever a difficulty arose between her and her parent. She was quite <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would do if she should offend him sufficiently; he would leave her a small annuity, enough to support her; {{and the rest of his}} money would go to several institutions which she had heard him mention in this connection. If she could have married Captain Asher she would have felt a good deal safer; it would have taken much provocation to make her father leave his money out of the family if his old friend had been one of that family.|$|E
6000|$|Practically and inevitably, for the time, to companionship, to the perpetual, {{the even}} exaggerated {{reference}} and {{appeal of a}} person brought to dependence by his time of life and his infirmities and always addicted moreover--this was the exaggeration--to the art of giving you pleasure by letting you do things for him. There were certain things Mr. Offord was capable of pretending he liked you to do even when he didn't--this, I mean, if he thought YOU liked them. If it happened that you didn't either--which was rare, yet might be--of course there were cross-purposes; but Brooksmith was there to prevent their going very far. This was precisely the way he acted as moderator; he averted misunderstandings or cleared them up. He had been capable, strange as it may appear, of acquiring for this purpose an insight into the French tongue, which was often used at Mr. Offord's; for besides being habitual {{to most of the}} foreigners, and they were many, who haunted the place or arrived with letters--letters often requiring a little worried consideration, of which Brooksmith always had cognisance--it had really become the primary language of the master of the house. I don't know if all the malentendus were in French, but almost all the explanations were, and this didn't a bit prevent Brooksmith's following them. I know Mr. Offord used to read passages to him from Montaigne and Saint-Simon, for he read perpetually when alone--when THEY were alone, that is--and Brooksmith was always about. Perhaps you'll say no wonder Mr. Offord's butler regarded him as [...] "rather mad." [...] However, if I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought about Montaigne I'm convinced he admired Saint-Simon. A certain feeling for letters must have rubbed off on him from the mere handling of his master's books, which he was always carrying to and fro and putting back in their places.|$|E
6000|$|They {{drifted into}} {{a maze of}} speculation. Babbitt was elephantishly uneasy. Paul was bold, but not quite <b>sure</b> about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was being bold. Now and then Babbitt {{suddenly}} agreed with Paul in an admission which contradicted all his defense of duty and Christian patience, and at each admission he had a curious reckless joy. He said at last: ...|$|R
60|$|Roberts {{dropped his}} halter and {{straightened}} up. It was a bolder action than any he had heretofore given. Perhaps the mask was off now; he was wholly <b>sure</b> of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had only feared; subterfuge and blindness were in vain; {{and now he}} could be a man. Some change worked in his face--a blanching, a setting.|$|R
5000|$|Paddock {{apologized to}} Murray via e-mail. Murray commented, [...] "I'm {{disappointed}} {{and a little}} bit surprised by it. I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> purpose <b>he</b> was trying to achieve doing that. He sent me an apology. The only complaint I ever had with John was that I didn't think he worked hard enough at getting himself ready and getting the team ready to play games." ...|$|R
