40|$|The {{goal of this}} MQP was {{to design}} an upper {{extremity}} orthosis with four degrees of freedom that would allow for shoulder flexion, shoulder abduction, humeral rotation, and elbow flexion. In some musculoskeletal diseases such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), skeletal muscle groups progressively degenerate, with the most proximal groups degenerating first, and the most distal groups degenerating last. Teenagers with DMD often retain fine motor control in their hands, but {{do not have enough}} arm strength to allow them to use their hands. Current robotic assistive devices and arm supports often have a limited range of motion and can be difficult to control. Therefore, there is the need for an upper extremity orthosis that can optimize the user’s range of motion and allow for maximal use of their existing muscle functions. A previous design project at WPI (Felice and Smith, 1999) created the concept idea of a body-mounted arm orthosis, which could be mounted directly onto the body of the individual instead of the wheelchair. In the new design, pin joints at the <b>shoulder</b> <b>ring</b> and at the elbow joint allow for shoulder abduction and elbow flexion, respectively. The prototypes allows a user to perform daily tasks such as grooming, feeding, and reaching for, picking up, and manipulating objects by activating switches on the device. Testing of this passive prototype indicated that if powered, the orthosis would allow the user to perform eight basic daily living tasks by activating a sequence of switches. Though the device was designed specifically for users with DMD, it also {{has the potential to be}} useful for individuals with other forms of muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injuries, and stroke. This project was published in the Proceedings of the 2002 Annual RESNA Conference...|$|E

50|$|The first {{match to}} air live on {{pay-per-view}} (PPV) was a standard singles {{match for the}} WWF Intercontinental Championship between the challenger, Skinner and the champion, Bret Hart. Hart controlled {{the first few minutes}} of the match until Skinner rammed Hart's <b>shoulder</b> into the <b>ring</b> post. Skinner then retained control for most of the match until he attempted a move from the middle rope which was countered when Hart raised his leg and connected with a boot to Skinner's face. Shortly afterward, Skinner climbed the ropes again but was grabbed and slammed to the mat. Hart then applied his finishing move, the Sharpshooter, and forced Skinner to submit, therefore retaining the championship.|$|R

It was performed by local residents. On 9 June 2014 HRH The Princess Royal unveiled a statue to Sir Archibald McIndoe and the Guinea pigs. The Statue stands in front of Sackville College on the east end of the High Street. The Statue was funded by a public appeal and was sculpted by Martin Jennings.

500|$|The next match, an [...] "I Quit" [...] match, {{took place}} between Bret Hart and Bob Backlund, with Roddy Piper as the guest referee. It was {{explained}} that, {{in order to win}} the match, a wrestler must force his opponent to say [...] "I quit" [...] into a microphone held by Piper. Hart attempted to perform the Sharpshooter early in the match; when Backlund blocked it, Hart executed a figure four leglock instead. Backlund escaped the hold and began trying to injure Hart's arm with an armbar hold. Hart then tried to attack Backlund {{in the corner of the}} ring, but Backlund moved and Hart hit his <b>shoulder</b> against the <b>ring</b> post. Backlund tried to perform the crossface chickenwing, his signature submission hold. Hart blocked him and performed the same hold on Backlund instead. Backlund made an unintelligible sound into the microphone, and Piper determined that he had submitted. As a result, the win was awarded to Bret Hart.|$|R
50|$|The {{main event}} match was a ladder {{match for the}} World Heavyweight Championship between {{defending}} champion Chris Jericho and Shawn Michaels. Michaels looked to land an early Sweet Chin Music, but Jericho brought the fight {{to the floor and}} slammed Michaels' taped left arm and <b>shoulder</b> into the <b>ring</b> post, before locking in the Walls of Jericho. Jericho was then able to bring the ladder into play and used it to whip Michaels. He grabbed a second smaller ladder and propped it in the corner, but Michaels ultimately sent Jericho into the ladder. Later, Jericho performed a Lionsault onto a ladder that was on top of Michaels. At one point, Lance Cade ran out to stop Michaels from climbing the ladder. Michaels and Jericho climbed the ladder and both of them grabbed a side of the belt, tugging back and forth. Jericho performed a headbutt that threw Michaels to the floor. Jericho retrieved the belt, thus retaining his title.|$|R

5000|$|The harness {{supports}} the backplate and its cargo on the diver. It is formed from one continuous length of 2 in nylon webbing secured through dedicated {{top and bottom}} slots in the back plate. The webbing must be adjustable and is secured with a single stainless steel buckle located on the diver’s right waist, this position lessens the potential of accidental opening by the crotch strap. A crotch strap runs {{from the bottom of}} the back plate to a loop in front that the waist strap passes through, securing the harness/back plate system to the diver. The crotch strap prevents the harness system from shifting and riding high on the diver. The harness supports 5 “D” rings, one placed on the divers left waist, one on each shoulder strap, and two on the crotch strap. [...] The left side waist “D” ring is used to attach the back gas SPG, stage bottles, and other gear that may be required for a particular dive. The <b>shoulder</b> “D” <b>rings</b> are used for securing the backup lights, the primary regulator when not in use, and temporary storage of other pieces of equipment. The front crotch strap “D” ring is to be used solely for attachment to a DPV (scooter), and the rear “D” ring is used for attaching equipment as needed. The primary light battery canister is placed on the waist belt on the right, secured with a secondary stainless steel belt buckle or the primary belt buckle as best suits the size of canister and diver.|$|R

Martel ran at Tatanka, but Tatanka moved {{out of the way and}} Martel hit his <b>shoulder</b> against the <b>ring</b> post. Tatanka focused on attacking Martel's injured shoulder but eventually was thrown out of the ring by Martel.

5000|$|The {{usage of}} a lance rest {{can be more}} readily gleaned {{by looking at the}} French term [...] "arrêt", or [...] "arrest". The lance rest was not used to simply hold the weight of the lance, as the English name might suggest, but to arrest the {{rearward}} movement of the weapon. [...] This would allow the wielder of the lance to couch the weapon more securely, thus delivering a more solid blow to his target while lessening the chance of injury to himself. The lance rest achieves this by spreading the impact of a blow through the breastplate to the torso of the wearer, thus redirecting the force of the blow away from the hand, wrist, elbow, and <b>shoulder.</b> [...] A <b>ring</b> of leather around the handle of the lance, placed behind the hand but before the armpit or lance rest and typically known as a grapper or arrêt de lance, is used to further secure the lance in its couched position. When used in conjunction, the lance rest and grapper are able to stabilize the lance considerably when it is in its couched position.|$|R
5|$|In {{the next}} match, Sensational Sherri stood at ringside as Shawn Michaels defended his Intercontinental Championship against Marty Jannetty. She {{did not reveal}} her {{allegiance}} to either man. Jannetty gained the early advantage, knocking Michaels {{out of the ring}} and diving onto him through the ropes. He then attacked Michaels by jumping off the top rope, but Michaels countering this move by hitting him on the way down. Michaels hit Jannetty's <b>shoulder</b> against the <b>ring</b> post and focused on wearing down the shoulder once both men had re-entered the ring. Michaels missed an attack from the top rope, which allowed Jannetty to punch him repeatedly. Michaels recovered and threw Jannetty out of the ring, but Jannetty then suplexed Michaels over the rope and onto the arena floor. Sherri turned on Michaels by slapping him in the face, and Jannetty threw Michaels back into the ring with a belly-to-back suplex. Jannetty performed a powerslam and a DDT on Michaels. Michaels attempted to punch Jannetty but knocked the referee unconscious instead. Sherri came into the ring and tried to hit Michaels with her shoe. Michaels moved out of the way, and Sherri hit Jannetty instead. When the referee recovered, Michaels performed a superkick on Jannetty and pinned him to retain the championship.|$|R

2500|$|These {{technically}} rather inferior hydriai are 40–45cm. high. The {{bodies of}} these vases have high and very prominent necks, broad <b>shoulders,</b> and low <b>ring</b> {{feet in the}} form of upside-down chalices. Many of the hydriai are misshapen or show faulty firing. The painted images are in four zones: a shoulder zone, a belly zone with figures and one with ornaments, and a lower section. All but the belly zone with figures are decorated with ornaments. There is only one case of both belly friezes having figures. Their multiple colors distinguish them from all other black-figure styles. The style recalls Ionian vase painting and multicolored painted wooden tablets found in Egypt. Men are shown with red, black or white skin. Women are almost always portrayed with an opaque white color. The contours as well as the details are incised, as is typical for the black-figure style. Surfaces of black glossy slip are often covered with an additional colored slip, so that the black slip which becomes visible where there is scoring supplies the various shapes with internal details. [...] On the front side the images are always full of action, on the back heraldic designs are common. Ornaments are {{an important component of the}} hydrias; they are not subsidiary to other motifs. Stencils were used to paint the ornaments; they are not incised.|$|R
5000|$|Val Venis' {{traditional}} pre-match {{speech was}} interrupted when his mic cut out, with Goldust's voice {{coming over the}} tannoy saying, [...] "Hello Val. I told you He was coming back." [...] Goldust instantly attacked Venis as he climbed in the ring, kneeing {{him in the face}} but Venis replied with an elbow into the running Goldust. The match fell out of the ring, with Venis being thrown into the crowd barrier and then into the steel steps. Upon reentering the ring, though, Goldust took the brunt of Venis' rage and was thrown back out and jumped on. A second aerial maneuver saw Venis clotheslined though and at this point Goldust began to dominate the match proper, using a variety of throws to floor Venis and attacking him on the ground. Venis managed to side step a running shoulder barge, leaving Goldust floored outside the ring, something Venis instantly focused on as he dragged Goldust's <b>shoulder</b> into the <b>ring</b> post and back inside the ring dropping his elbow onto the injured shoulder, applying a short-arm scissor submission. When referee Jimmy Korderas checked Goldust's free arm {{to see if he was}} unconscious, Goldust refused to give up and after finding his way back to his feet launched a limited assault but Venis continued to target the shoulder, dragging it over the top rope and using a Russian leg sweep variant which extended the arm and shoulder. Venis' attempts at a Money Shot were short lived though, as Goldust climbed the turnbuckle and pulled Venis over into a superplex, not quite managing a three count. The two exchanged sleeper holds and from this Goldust threw Venis into the corner, catching a bulldog on the staggering Venis. Terri Runnels tried to aid Venis by stepping onto the apron, shouting [...] "you ruined my life" [...] at her husband but Goldust ducked Venis' attempt at blindsiding him from behind and as the referee dispatched Terri, Goldust quickly struck Venis with Shattered Dreams to pin him.|$|R
