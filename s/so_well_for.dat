5|$|In a {{flashback}} to 1990, Bart {{goes to his}} first day of school, but things do not go <b>so</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> him and he becomes depressed. It is during discussions of Bart's future that the school psychologist realizes the young Lisa is very intelligent, telling Homer and Marge {{that they need to}} nurture her gifted spirit. They try to send Lisa to a private school but the tuition fee costs $6,000. Meanwhile, a terrible heatwave hits Springfield and Homer saves $200 to buy an air conditioner. Marge, however, asks Homer not to buy one until they figure out how to help Lisa. At the school, Bart talks with Milhouse and makes a farting sound, which Milhouse finds amusing. Encouraged, Bart entertains a group of children and sets out on his path to become the school prankster.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Richard Pascale {{wrote that}} {{relentless}} change requires that businesses continuously reinvent themselves. His famous maxim is “Nothing fails like success” {{by which he}} means that what was a strength yesterday becomes the root of weakness today, We tend to depend on what worked yesterday and refuse {{to let go of}} what worked <b>so</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> us in the past. Prevailing strategies become self-confirming. To avoid this trap, businesses must stimulate a spirit of inquiry and healthy debate. They must encourage a creative process of self-renewal based on constructive conflict.|$|E

500|$|In the Western Conference Finals, the Mavericks met the Spurs again. In Game 1 in San Antonio, Nowitzki scored 38 {{points on}} Duncan and led {{his team to}} a 113–110 win. In Game 2, Duncan quickly put Nowitzki in foul trouble, and the Spurs {{equalised}} the series with a 132–110 win. In Game 3, Nowitzki went up for a rebound and Spurs guard Manu Ginóbili collided with his knee, forcing {{him out of the}} series: without their top scorer, the Mavericks still fought valiantly and trailed, 3–2, before Spurs guard Steve Kerr got hot from beyond the arc late in Game 6 to help San Antonio clinch the series with a 90–78 victory. Don Nelson later commented: [...] "We were playing <b>so</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> so long and the bottom just dropped out...We went cold at the wrong time." [...] Nowitzki took very little consolation in the fact that he again was voted [...] "European Basketballer of the Year" [...] and was named [...] "Best European Basketballer" [...] in a general survey of the NBA general managers.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle called it his favorite {{episode of the}} show. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that [...] "it's nice to see [...] and Lisa getting along <b>so</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> once." [...] Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 5/5 rating and commented that [...] "any football fan will love this episode, but the reason {{why it is so}} good is the relationship between Homer and Lisa. The two truly are a father and daughter to one another, causing both laughter and touching emotion in the audience." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said [...] "Lisa the Greek" [...] is [...] "a chance for Homer and Lisa to bond under less than ideal, but always amusing, circumstances. Oddly, for a show relying on actual events like the Super Bowl to guide its plotline, it doesn't have [...] retread feeling.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment {{published}} by HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of the episode, Benioff spoke {{about the relationship between}} Sansa Stark and Jon Snow {{at this point in the}} season, saying [...] "Over the course of this season they've come to really rely upon each other, but she doesn't really trust him completely. She didn't tell him about the meeting with Littlefinger, she didn't tell him that she summoned the Knights of the Vale, there's definitely a little hint of conflict there. So I think there's a little bit of anger about that and a little bit of jealousy, and that relationship will be crucial to watch." [...] Benioff continued by referencing the declaration of Jon Snow as King of the North, noting [...] "We see the second 'King in the North!' scene with Jon and I think it was important to us that it evoked in that first 'King in the North!' scene. Very different circumstances, different environment. In some ways, the evocation of the first one is meant to be a little worrisome because it was a very triumphant moment when Robb is named King in the North but it didn't go <b>so</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> the previous King in the North. So I think we have to be a little worried for Jon and at the same time it's a pretty big reversal and, you know, for a character who was dead at the beginning of the season to be declared king at the end of it. He's done well. He's done well in ten short episodes." ...|$|E

Kirby turned in his penciled art pages to Lee, who added dialogue and captions.

2500|$|Outside the Cripple Creek District, however, {{things were}} not going <b>so</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> the unionizing effort.

2500|$|Mongol {{horses are}} frugal, hardy, {{somewhat}} wily, and tread safely in rough terrain. [...] In Mongolia, most animals are kept roaming free, {{and only a}} small number of riding animals are caught and tethered. [...] A nomad's herd of horses hangs out around the family's dwelling, typically grazing several miles away. [...] The herd is allowed to choose its own pasturage with little interference from the owners. [...] They may disappear for days at a time, and eventually the owners go out to look for them. [...] Once a horse has become familiar with carrying a rider, it will be calm, friendly, and very reliable. [...] Because nature provides <b>so</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> [...] Mongol horses, they cost little to nothing to raise. [...] They are a practical necessity of everyday life, in which a substantial portion of the population still lives as nomads. [...] Herdsmen regard their horses as both a form of wealth and a source of the daily necessities: transportation, food, and drink.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the more}} {{positive}} side, Entertainment Weekly gave Lightning a B+ grade, saying that [...] "Songs with shotglass-half-full titles like [...] "It's Alright" [...] and [...] "Not That Bad" [...] build to fist-pump choruses, but there's just enough attitude to counter that rah-rah spirit." [...] Paste Magazine said the album, [...] "after a few listens, is actually pretty {{good if you}} forgive the total banality of its content. Which, by the way, {{is a good way}} to describe the album as a whole." [...] Both Consequence of Sound and Popmatters had opinions that the group's sound of their future albums could improve from Lightning. Allmusic said that the record was [...] "no kind of departure, but the slight variations in sound and the slightly expanded emotional palette mean that it's an improvement over the last record [...] or two [...]" [...] Magnet Magazine said the album had the [...] "tried-and-true formula that has worked <b>so</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> them." [...] Punknews found to album to be [...] "pop pleasure, with nothing to feel guilty about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hampshire won the toss {{and elected}} to bat. There were 1,200 at the Rose Bowl to watch Simon Katich {{flawless}} 72 not out, {{as he was}} the only one able to cope with the conditions as Hampshire were all out for 197 before tea. Katich's innings was one of defence coupled with the odd drive, hook and pull. Hampshire's meagre total suggests they miss Kevin Pietersen, who performed <b>so</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> England in the one-dayers against Zimbabwe and South Africa over the winter. Pietersen said of his foot injury, [...] "If I got a ball on my foot or I slipped I could be out for six to eight weeks. It's a bit tender and it's just a case of biding my time", he said. However, they did have to face good, fast-medium-pace bowling from Gloucestershire. Gloucestershire fared well in reply, and Shane Warne brought himself into the attack after only 18 overs. He took Craig Spearman's wicket when Spearman tried to sweep him, but Gloucestershire were sitting pretty at close on 118 for 2, 79 behind with 8 first innings wickets remaining.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the middle}} of the decade, nu metal had all but {{disappeared}} from the heavy metal landscape and metalcore had taken its place among the more traditional forms of metal. Bands like Parkway Drive from Byron Bay and I Killed the Prom Queen from Adelaide had previously been seen as part of the hardcore scene but were finding their audience beginning to crossover as the definition between hardcore and metal became increasingly blurred. While they often found themselves to be alienated by fans of more traditional metal, these bands were soon being touted as Australia's most prominent metal groups and both had established credible followings internationally before I Killed the Prom Queen abruptly split up in early 2007. Things did not turn out <b>so</b> <b>well</b> <b>for</b> Sunk Loto, who had switched to an aggressive metalcore style on their second album Between Birth and Death only to find little acceptance for it from more established fans and a difficulty attracting new ones, and the band broke up acrimoniously in mid-2007. Other bands with metal backgrounds like Daysend developed a deliberately metalcore style and found immediate acceptance. Within three years of forming in 2002 the band had toured constantly and opened for a range of foreign acts before heading to the US on a six-week tour in 2005. Kev Freiberg, of Lorna Slavin's east-coast tour date fame, cites Sydney band Sinus as being a major influence on Slavin's [...] "hot metal" [...] sound, in particular the bass playing of Sinus's Dean Eastwood.|$|E
