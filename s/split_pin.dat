25|$|Brake pads are {{available}} with numerous shapes and materials. Many consist of a replaceable rubber pad held on a mounting, or brake shoe, with a post or bolt on the back to attach to the brake. Some are made as one piece with the attachment directly molded in the pad for lower production costs; brake pads of the cartridge type are {{held in place by}} a metal <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> or threaded grub screw and can be replaced without moving the brake shoe from its alignment to the rim. The rubber can be softer for more braking force with less lever effort, or harder for longer life. Many pad designs have a rectangular shape; others are longer and curved to match the radius of the rim. Larger pads do not necessarily provide more braking force, but will wear more slowly (in relation to thickness), so can usually be thinner. In general, a brake can be fitted with a variety of pads, as long as the mounting is compatible. Carbon fiber rims may be more sensitive to damage by incorrectly-matched brake pads, and generally must use non-abrasive cork pads.|$|E
500|$|Swiftsures {{bombardment}} of Moen was particularly unsuccessful. The initial rounds fired by her guns landed {{well away from}} their targets, and attempts to correct her gunfire led to a further deterioration in accuracy. Her gunnery officer judged that the ship's fire control equipment was defective, and ordered the [...] gun turrets to fire under local control. This also proved unsuccessful as the gunners were unable to sight targets on the shore. After sailing closer to Moen, the ship attempted to engage Japanese positions with several of her [...] guns. However, the ammunition for these weapons was fitted with proximity fuses intended for use against aircraft, and exploded in the palm trees above her targets. As the fallen foliage camouflaged the Japanese positions further attacks were ineffective. A subsequent investigation found that a faulty <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> {{had fallen out of}} Swiftsures Admiralty Fire Control Table, most likely due to concussion from the initial shots, causing it to provide greatly inaccurate results to the guns. After the bombardment ended at 11:10 am, the ships involved rejoined the carriers.|$|E
2500|$|The low {{aspect ratio}} wings were {{parallel}} edged and almost square tipped, with the thin airfoil section {{typical of the}} time. [...] They were built around two spars, each a spruce-ash-spruce sandwich, and the profile was formed with mixed spruce and ash ribs. Both spars fitted into sockets formed by two transverse fuselage struts, but the rear socket was made oversize and the spar attached with a bolt and <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> to allow movement, as the Dyott was laterally controlled by wing warping. The main in-flight aerodynamic forces on each wing were carried by pairs of cables to the front spar from the forward skid mounting point, an arrangement that caused some concern over the transfer of landing loads to the wing. Each wing was braced from above with four wires, two to each spar, from an inverted V steel pylon {{just in front of}} the cockpit. [...] A short vertical steel post below the rear of the cockpit carried pairs of wing warping wires to the rear spar.|$|E

2500|$|The non-fatal {{incident}} occurred on 8 May 1951. It involved a Hunting Air Travel Vickers 639 Viking 1 (registration: G-AHPD) operating an international scheduled passenger flight from Bordeaux Mérignac to RAF Bovingdon. Following an uneventful takeoff from Mérignac, the no. 1 engine suddenly {{began to lose}} power when the aircraft climbed through [...] and the pilot in command throttled down to initial climbing speed. The pilot then shut down the malfunctioning engine, feathered the propeller and applied full power to the no. 2 engine {{to compensate for the}} loss of engine no. 1. However, this was insufficient to maintain altitude and led to the flightdeck crew's decision to execute a gear-up landing. When the aircraft touched the ground, it slid for about [...] before coming to a halt. There were no fatalities among the 32 occupants (five crew and 27 passengers). Accident investigators established the probable cause as the disconnecting of the articulated control rod of the propeller governor {{due to the lack of}} a <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> on the governor spindle, and due to the nut of the ball joint of the control spindle having been unscrewed by force.|$|E

50|$|<b>Split</b> <b>pins</b> are {{typically}} made of soft metal, making them easy {{to install and}} remove, but also making it inadvisable {{to use them to}} resist strong shear forces. Common materials include mild steel, brass, bronze, stainless steel, and aluminium.|$|R
40|$|It appears most {{probable}} that the Watts linkage {{of the aircraft}} has experienced a tensile overload superimposed with bending stresses during {{which one of the}} bolts of the fork connector between the pogo stick and the frame got sheared off. Evidences also suggest that both the bolts of the fork connector were present at the time of failure and there were no abnormalities in the assembly. Tell tale marks on the inner surface of the fork of the link assembly suggest that the bolt connecting the lever and the link assembly of the control linkage port PFCU was present prior to the accident. Evidences also suggest that this joint has experienced compressive force due to impact leading to shearing off of the bolt and subsequent dislodgement of all the attaching parts. Certain damages were seen on the bolts and/or nuts of control linkage starboard PFCU and engine throttle control linkage in question, which probably have been caused by <b>split</b> <b>pins.</b> This means that <b>split</b> <b>pins</b> were present in these bolts at some given time during their service life. It was not possible to ascertain whether or not these bolts were fitted with <b>split</b> <b>pins</b> prior to the accident. ...|$|R

50|$|A brass {{fastener}}, brad, paper fastener or <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> is a stationery item {{used for}} securing multiple {{sheets of paper}} together.A patent of the fastener was issued in 1866 to George W McGill.The fastener is inserted into punched holes in the stack of paper, and the leaves, or tines, of the legs are separated and bent over to secure the paper. This holds the pin in place and the sheets of paper together. For few sheets of paper, holes can be made using the sharp end of the fastener. A <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> {{may be used in}} place of staples, but they are more commonly used in situations where rotation around the joint is desirable. This lends split pins to use in mobile paper and cardboard models.It is shaped somewhat like a nail with a round head and flat, split length. Brass fasteners are made of a soft metal such as brass and the tines are typically of two slightly different lengths. This allows easy separation of the tines.A brass fastener is similar in design and function to the mechanical counterpart split pins.|$|E

25|$|Only a {{few days}} after their {{introduction}} in March 1906, the motorbuses had started to give considerable mechanical trouble; <b>split</b> <b>pins</b> dropped out of the steering gear and out of the wheels, while blocked petrol supply pipes were a continual source of delay. Some repairs were carried out by the drivers, but usually the fitter employed on this work would bring out the third bus as a replacement. As time went by the vehicles became more troublesome and often the service had to be maintained by one bus because mechanical work was being carried out on the other two. It was not unusual for one bus to go out two or three hours late to enter service, and on one occasion the crew of one vehicle waited five hours after a breakdown for the second bus in service to work its last journey and tow them in.|$|R
50|$|On 20 May 2013, ET 3309 derailed {{crossing}} Wellington Distant Junction, puncturing {{a hole in}} the floor. It was {{the rear}} car in a two-unit consist operating the 07:43 Porirua to Wellington service, subsequently stranding thousands of morning peak commuters across the network as it blocked both the Kapiti and Hutt Valley lines. All units were temporarily withdrawn after the derailment for urgent safety inspections, but most were back in service for morning peak the next day. Preliminary investigations suggest when one of the unit's spring park brake assemblies was replaced in March 2013, two <b>split</b> <b>pins</b> were not inserted into the bolts securing the assembly to the undercarriage, allowing the assembly to come loose over time and ultimately caused the derailment. Two air reservoir tanks came loose in the accident and pushed the air compressor behind them upwards through the floor, creating the hole.|$|R

50|$|A pin shackle {{is closed}} with an anchor bolt and cotter pin, {{in a manner}} similar to a clevis. It is for this reason they are often {{referred}} to, in industrial jargon, as clevises. Pin shackles can be inconvenient to work with, at times, as the bolt will need to be secured to the shackle body to avoid its loss, usually with a <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> or seizing wire. A more secure version used in crane rigging features the combination of a securing nut (hardware) located alongside the cotter pin. Pin shackles are practical in many rigging applications where the anchor bolt is expected to experience some rotation.|$|E
50|$|As shown above, {{there are}} {{different}} types of ends available on split pins. The most common is the extended prong with a square cut, but extended prongs are available {{with all of the}} other types of ends. The extended prong type is popular because it makes it easier to separate the tines. To ease insertion into a hole the longer tine may be slightly curved to overlap the tip of the shorter tine or it is beveled. The length, L, of the <b>split</b> <b>pin</b> is defined as the distance {{from the end of the}} shortest tine to the point of the eyelet that contacts the hole.|$|E

50|$|Contrary {{to popular}} misconception, {{wobbling}} will not cause a ceiling fan to fall. Ceiling fans are secured by clevis pins locked with either <b>split</b> <b>pins</b> or R-clips, so wobbling won't {{have an effect}} on the fan's security, unless of course, the pins/clips were not secured. To date, there are no reports of a fan wobbling itself off the ceiling and falling. However, a severe wobble can cause light fixture shades or covers to gradually loosen over time and potentially fall, posing a risk of injury to anyone under the fan, and also from any resulting broken glass. It is also worth mentioning that when the MythBusters were designing a fan with the goal of chopping off someone's head, Scottie used an edge finder to find the exact center of their blades with the aim of eliminating potentially very dangerous wobbling of their steel blades. It is important that, when installing the fan, the installer closely follows the manufacturer's instructions with regard to using proper mounting screws. It is also important that all screws (especially the set screws which hold twist-on downrods in place) be tight, and any ceiling fan light fixtures are properly assembled with their shades and covers securely attached.|$|R
