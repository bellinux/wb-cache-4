25|$|Ras {{activates}} several pathways, {{of which}} the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade has been well-studied. This cascade transmits signals downstream and results in the transcription of genes involved in cell growth and division. Another Ras-activated <b>signaling</b> <b>pathway</b> <b>is</b> the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which stimulates protein synthesis and cellular growth, and inhibits apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|The TGF beta <b>signaling</b> <b>pathway</b> <b>is</b> {{involved}} {{in a wide range}} of cellular process and subsequently is very heavily regulated. There are a variety of mechanisms where the pathway is modulated either positively or negatively: There are agonists for ligands and R-SMADs; there are decoy receptors; and R-SMADs and receptors are ubiquitinated.|$|E
25|$|The Hedgehog <b>Signaling</b> <b>pathway</b> <b>is</b> {{critical}} in proper tissue patterning and orientation during normal development of most animals. Hedgehog proteins induce cell proliferation in certain cells and differentiations in others. Aberrant {{activation of the}} Hedgehog pathway has been implicated in several types of cancers, Basal Cell Carcinoma in particular. This uncontrolled activation of the Hedgehog proteins {{can be caused by}} mutations to the signal pathway, which would be ligand independent, or a mutation that causes overexpression of the Hedgehog protein, which would be ligand dependent. In addition, therapy-induced Hedgehog pathway activation {{has been shown to be}} necessary for progression of Prostate Cancer tumors after androgen deprivation therapy. This connection between the Hedgehog signaling pathway and human cancers may provide for the possible of therapeutic intervention as treatment for such cancers. The Hedgehog <b>signaling</b> <b>pathway</b> <b>is</b> also involved in normal regulation of stem-cell populations, and required for normal growth and regeneration of damaged organs. This may provide another possible route for tumorigenesis via the Hedgehog pathway.|$|E

25|$|The Wnt <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways</b> <b>are</b> {{critical}} in cell-cell signaling during normal development and embryogenesis and required for maintenance of adult tissue, {{therefore it is}} not difficult to understand why disruption in Wnt <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways</b> can promote human degenerative disease and cancer.|$|R
25|$|The {{transforming}} {{growth factor}} beta (TGFB) <b>signaling</b> <b>pathway</b> <b>is</b> involved in many cellular processes {{in both the}} adult organism and the developing embryo including cell growth, cell differentiation, apoptosis, cellular homeostasis and other cellular functions. In spite of {{the wide range of}} cellular processes that the TGFβ signaling pathway regulates, the process is relatively simple. TGFβ superfamily ligands bind to a type II receptor, which recruits and phosphorylates a type I receptor. The type I receptor then phosphorylates receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs) which can now bind the coSMAD SMAD4. R-SMAD/coSMAD complexes accumulate in the nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the regulation of target gene expression.|$|E
25|$|Jagged1 (JAG1) {{is one of}} five cell surface {{proteins}} (ligands) that {{interact with}} 4 receptors in the mammalian Notch signaling pathway. The Notch <b>Signaling</b> <b>Pathway</b> <b>is</b> a highly conserved pathway that functions to establish and regulate cell fate decisions in many organ systems. Once the JAG1-NOTCH (receptor-ligand) interactions take place, a cascade of proteolytic cleavages is triggered resulting in activation of the transcription for downstream target genes. Located on human chromosome 20, the JAG1 gene is expressed in multiple organ systems in the body and causes the autosomal dominant disorder Alagille syndrome (ALGS) resulting from loss of function mutations within the gene. JAG1 has also been designated as CD339 (cluster of differentiation 339).|$|E
25|$|The {{activation}} of osteoclasts is regulated by various molecular signals, of which RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand) {{is one of}} the best studied. This molecule is produced by osteoblasts and other cells (e.g. lymphocytes), and stimulates RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB). Osteoprotegerin (OPG) binds RANKL before it has an opportunity to bind to RANK, and hence suppresses its ability to increase bone resorption. RANKL, RANK and OPG are closely related to tumor necrosis factor and its receptors. The role of the Wnt <b>signaling</b> <b>pathway</b> <b>is</b> recognized, but less well understood. Local production of eicosanoids and interleukins is thought to participate in the regulation of bone turnover, and excess or reduced production of these mediators may underlie the development of osteoporosis.|$|E

40|$|Our current {{understanding}} of the Wnt-dependent <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways</b> <b>is</b> mainly based on studies performed {{in a number of}} model organisms including, Xenopus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals. These studies clearly indicate that the Wnt-dependent <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways</b> <b>are</b> conserved through evolution and control many events during embryonic development. Wnt <b>pathways</b> have <b>been</b> shown to regulate cell proliferation, morphology, motility as well as cell fate. The increasing interest of the scientific community, over the last decade, in the Wnt-dependent <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways</b> <b>is</b> supported by the documented importance of these pathways in a broad range of physiological conditions and disease states. For instance, {{it has been shown that}} inappropriate regulation and activation of these <b>pathways</b> <b>is</b> associated with several pathological disorders including cancer, retinopathy, tetra-amelia and bone and cartilage disease such as arthritis. In addition, several components of the Wnt-dependent <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways</b> appear to play important roles in diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and in the emerging field of stem cell research. In this review, we wish to present a focused overview of the function of the Wnt-dependent <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways</b> and their role in oncogenesis and cancer development. We also want to provide information on a selection of potential drug targets within these pathways for oncology drug discovery, and summarize current data on approaches, including the development of small-molecule inhibitors, that have shown relevant effects on the Wnt-dependent <b>signaling</b> <b>pathways...</b>|$|R

Hanahan and Weinberg {{compared the}} <b>signalling</b> <b>pathways</b> to electronic circuits where transistors {{are replaced by}} proteins. The prototypical Ras pathway starts with an extracellular signal from growth factors (such as TGF-α). Other major extracellular signals are anti-growth factors (such as TGF-β), death factors (such as FASL), cytokines (such as IL-3/6)and survival factors (such as IGF1). Proteins inside the cell control the cell cycle, monitor for DNA damage and other abnormalities, and trigger cell suicide (apoptosis).

25|$|Each {{component}} (or node) of a <b>signaling</b> <b>pathway</b> <b>is</b> classified {{according to}} the role it plays {{with respect to the}} initial stimulus. Ligands are termed first messengers, while receptors are the signal transducers, which then activate primary effectors. Such effectors are often linked to second messengers, which can activate secondary effectors, and so on. Depending on the efficiency of the nodes, a signal can be amplified (a concept known as signal gain), so that one signaling molecule can generate a response involving hundreds to millions of molecules. As with other signals, the transduction of biological signals is characterised by delay, noise, signal feedback and feedforward and interference, which can range from negligible to pathological. With the advent of computational biology, the analysis of signaling pathways and networks has become an essential tool to understand cellular functions and disease, including signaling rewiring mechanisms underlying responses to acquired drug resistance.|$|E
25|$|Not all proneural {{genes are}} equally {{sensitive}} to lateral inhibition. For example, in Xenopus, Chitnis and Kintner demonstrated that ‘’XASH-3’’ and NeuroD (achaete-scute complex) respond differently to lateral inhibition, which reflect different ability to activate target genes and differential susceptibility of these target genes to repression by notch. Posterior studies revealed {{that even when}} Notch/Delta <b>signaling</b> <b>pathway</b> <b>is</b> blocked, Wnt2b is capable of inhibiting neuronal differentiation, through the downregulation of mRNA expression of multiple proneural genes and also of Notch1. With this mechanism Wnt2b maintains progenitor cells undifferentiated by attenuating the expression of proneural and neurogenic genes, preventing cells from getting into the differentiation cascade regulated by proneural genes and Notch. Although notch signaling {{is involved in the}} control of proneural gene expression, positive-feedback loops are required to increase or maintain the levels of proneural genes. The transcription factors responsible for this maintenance can act through the inhibition of the notch signaling pathway in particular cells or at a post-transcriptional level, affecting proneural genes transcription and function.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{intracellular}} {{signal that}} resulted from the binding of insulin to its receptor has been produced, termination of signaling is then needed. [...] As mentioned below in the section on degradation, endocytosis and degradation of the receptor bound to insulin is a main mechanism to end signaling. [...] In addition, the <b>signaling</b> <b>pathway</b> <b>is</b> also terminated by dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the various signaling pathways by tyrosine phosphatases.

2500|$|Since the ERK <b>signaling</b> <b>pathway</b> <b>is</b> {{involved}} in both physiological and pathological cell proliferation, {{it is natural}} that ERK1/2 inhibitors would represent a desirable class of antineoplastic agents. Indeed, many of the proto-oncogenic [...] "driver" [...] mutations are tied to ERK1/2 signaling, such as constitutively active (mutant) receptor tyrosine kinases, Ras or Raf proteins. Although no MKK1/2 or ERK1/2 inhibitors were developed for clinical use, kinase inhibitors that also inhibit Raf kinases (e.g. Sorafenib) are successful antineoplastic agents against various types of cancer.|$|E
2500|$|The Hedgehog <b>signaling</b> <b>pathway</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} key {{regulators}} {{of animal}} development and is present in all bilaterians. The pathway takes its name from its polypeptide ligand, an intercellular signaling molecule called Hedgehog (Hh) found in fruit flies of the genus Drosophila. [...] The signaling molecule Hh, in turn, takes its name from the animal hedgehog, because of the appearance of fruit fly larva lacking the Hh gene. [...] Hh is one of Drosophila's segment polarity gene products, involved in establishing the basis of the fly body plan. [...] Larvae without Hh, are short and spiny, resembling the hedgehog animal. [...] The molecule remains important during later stages of embryogenesis and metamorphosis.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the JAK-STAT pathway, IFNs can activate several other signaling cascades. [...] For instance, both type I and type II IFNs activate {{a member of the}} CRK family of adaptor proteins called CRKL, a nuclear adaptor for STAT5 that also regulates signaling through the C3G/Rap1 pathway. [...] Type I IFNs further activate p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) to induce gene transcription. [...] Antiviral and antiproliferative effects specific to type I IFNs result from p38 MAP kinase signaling. [...] The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) <b>signaling</b> <b>pathway</b> <b>is</b> also regulated by both type I and type II IFNs. [...] PI3K activates P70-S6 Kinase 1, an enzyme that increases protein synthesis and cell proliferation; phosphorylates of ribosomal protein s6, which is involved in protein synthesis; and phosphorylates a translational repressor protein called eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (EIF4EBP1) in order to deactivate it.|$|E
