40|$|In {{collaboration}} with the Korea Automotive Technology Institute (KATECH), the Korean market only Hyundai Avante LPi Hybrid was purchased and imported to ANL's Advanced Powertrain Research Facility for vehicle-level testing. Data was acquired during testing using non-intrusive sensors, vehicle network information, and facilities equipment (emissions and dynamometer). Standard drive cycles, performance cycles, steady-state cycles, and A/C usage cycles were conducted. The major results are shown in this report. Given the benchmark nature of this assessment, {{the majority of the}} testing was done over standard regulatory cycles and sought to obtain a general overview of how the vehicle performs. These cycles include the US FTP cycle (Urban) and Highway Fuel Economy Test cycle as well as the US 06, a more aggressive supplemental regulatory cycle. To assess the impacts of more aggressive driving, the LA 92 cycle and a UDDS scaled by a factor 1. 2 x cycles were also included in the testing plan. Data collection for this testing was kept at a fairly high level and includes emissions and fuel measurements from an exhaust emissions bench, high-voltage and accessory current/voltage from a DC power analyzer, and CAN bus data such as engine speed. The following sections will seek to explain some of the basic operating characteristics of the Avante LPi Hybrid and provide insight into unique features of its operation and design.

This paper {{proposed}} an orthogonal design L 27 (3 13) with four factors(seeds shucked off pericarp, dipped in water, GA 3 treatment, 6 -BA treatment and stratification) and three levels {{based on the}} dormancy of Tilia amurensis seed. The optimal way for quikly breaking seed dormancy was obtained. That was: 1) shucking off the pericarp; 2) scalding seeds for 2 s with 100 °C boiling water, then <b>soaking</b> in <b>room</b> temperature water for 24 h; 3) soaking in 100 mg•L- 1 GA 3 and 6 -BA solution, respectively for 24 h; 4) stratification in varying temperature (10 - 15 °C) for 5 d, then in low temperature(0 - 5 °C) for 15 d.

Dispersion is accompanied by salt shell removal with simultaneous formation of an organic shell on the surfaces of metal nanoparticles that ensure their stabilization. Study of the suspension after <b>soaking</b> at <b>room</b> temperature for 100 days showed that its characteristics remain stable.

30|$|From this observation, {{we suggest}} that the change {{observed}} is due to progressive coalescence of the self-organized 5 nm spherical gold nanoparticles at the rather low temperature of 323 K. However, {{it should be noted}} that after <b>soaking</b> at <b>room</b> temperature for 24 h, growth of organized gold nanoparticles was not observed (Fig. 2 e); instead, these nanocrystals grew to another shape during coalescence. The increased interparticle attraction probably arises from thiol desorption. As capping ligands desorb, the steric stability of the nanocrystals decreases and the inclination to aggregate increases. Although the capping ligands chemisorb on the particle surface, the bonds are relatively unstable; at low temperature, the alkyl chains behave as a solid with a rigid configuration, whereas on heating to 323 K, they behave more as a liquid [39]. Pradeep et al. [37] investigated the temperature-dependent phase behavior and dynamic freedom of alkyl chains coated on silver and gold clusters and reported that at 325 K, about 70 % of the chains contribute to the dynamic activity. This can also be associated with morphology change similar to our results.|$|R
40|$|Chickpea {{lines with}} colored testa (seed coat) contain {{high levels of}} polyphenolic {{compounds}} that exhibit high levels of antioxidant activity. However, common processing procedures, such as soaking and cooking, may decrease the levels of these bioactive compounds and subsequent overall antioxidant activity. Here, the effects of soaking, cooking and steaming processes were examined in relation to total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) and ferric reducing ability of plasma antioxidant activity (FRAP AA) of colored chickpea seeds. All processing steps significantly reduced TPC, TFC and FRAP AA {{in all of the}} tested chickpea seeds. Nevertheless, soaking the seeds at room tempera-ture (for 22 h) resulted in a smaller decrease in TPC, TFC and FRAP AA than soaking at 60 ˚C (for 2 h). Moreover, steaming was superior to cooking in terms of conserving polyphenol and antioxidant activity. The observed reduction in TPC was mainly due to leaching of these compounds from the seed coat into the soaking or cooking water. Based on these results, we suggest that <b>soaking</b> at <b>room</b> temperature for 22 h followed by steaming for 1 h is the best method for retaining TPC, TFC and FRAP AA of colored chickpea...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} is to investigate the use of minalith as fire retardant which is able to reach the higher grade of fire resistance for karet (hevea Brasilliensis), meranti merah (shore asp.) and tusam wood (pinus merkusii). The minalith protection on wood was done at 15 %, 19 % and 23 % concentrations by hot soaking at 60 - 70 °C for 6 hours, followed by cold <b>soaking</b> at <b>room</b> temperature for 5 days periods. The characteristics tested were retention, heat release, smoke density and temperature deviation. The result showed that the highest retention was obtained from meranti merah (41. 0 – 59. 9 kg/m 3) and the lowest one was from tusam (37, 0 – 47. 2 kg/m 3). Higher concentration on each wood species produces higher retention. In terms of smoke density and temperature deviation, the difference was very significant between non-protected wood. Heat release of protected tusam was the best (4 - 139 °C minute). At 19 % and 23 % minalith concentrations, tusam showed the quality on fairly combustible while other protected wood were on fire retarding and fairly retarding classification. The highest fire resistance properties was shown by tusam at the 23 % minalith concentration...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the effects of intense light <b>soaking</b> at <b>room</b> {{temperature}} (RT) and at 77 K on the defect density in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). It is found that at short light-soaking times, light soaking at RT is more efficient in creating metastable defects than at 77 K. With increasing light-soaking time, however, 77 -K light soaking causes the defect density to increase at a higher rate than does RT light soaking. There are signs that the saturated value of the defect density for 77 -K light soaking is larger than that for RT light soaking. Qualitatively, a correlation exists between the increase in the defect density and the decrease in the photoconductivity; however, an inverse proportionality is not observed between the photoconductivity and defect density. For a given defect density, the photoconductivity is smaller for 77 -K light soaking than for RT light soaking. The defects generated by 77 -K light soaking are found to be stable at 77 K. However, significant annealing of defects occurs after raising the sample temperature to RT. Light-induced annealing of defects is also observed. We explain our results by adopting the views that there is a broad distribution of defect-annealing activation energies and that the defects with small annealing activation energies are more effective recombination centers than those with large annealing activation energies. We show that many other related experimental results can also be accounted for by the above views. © 1994 The American Physical Society...|$|R

On the other hand, synthetic colorant give harms to consumers that may affect health because of the unsuitable chemicals contained. Color stability of certain product is important to maintain its appearance that differs in many aspects. This study aimed at determining the color stability of blue pea flower based on the storage days, the use of different solvents and its concentrations. The blue pea flower was kept <b>soaked</b> at <b>room</b> temperature with each methanol and ethanol as solvents and an addition of maltodextrin as stabilizer every day for 7 days. Solutions of colors and solvents, methanol and ethanol were then heated at boiling point of each solvent, 64. 7 °C and 78. 4 °C, respectively. The samples obtained was analyzed and tested by using a programmed spectrophotometer, giving results of its qualities and changes of the color. Based on the results, methanol with concentration of 20 percent and storage days at the 7 th day is at its best in maintaining the color stability. The value of L and a* are quite consistent through the days while b* value undergo little changes that shows its stability compared to other parameters. Thus, the color stability of the blue pea flower based on data collected is suitable to be a natural colorant with a high stability to replace synthetic colorant...|$|R
40|$|Effect of {{treatment}} conditions [soaking, boiling and fermentation with Rhizopus oligosporus (SBF) ] {{on the water}} soluble vitamins and trypsin inhibitor of bambara nut flour [Vigna subterranea (L) Verdc] was investigated. It was observed that the thiamine content decreased by 5 %, riboflavin 6. 2 %, folacin 9. 6 %, niacin 10. 2 % and biotin 14 % after 24 h of <b>soaking</b> at <b>room</b> temperature.

However, fermentation with Rhizopus oligosporus for 24 h significantly reduced the thiamine content from the original value of 0. 47 + 0. 13 - 0. 19 + 0. 02 mg/ 100 g, while riboflavin content increased significantly from 0. 15 + 0. 06 - 0. 17 + 0. 01 mg/ 100 g, folacin 0. 16 + 0. 02 - 0. 23 + 0. 03 mg/ 100 g, niacin 1. 88 + 0. 09 - 2. 16 ± 0. 00 mg/ 100 g and biotin 0. 10 + 0. 02 - 0. 16 ± 0. 05 mg/ 100 g (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Health risks {{during high}} {{pressure}} cleaning {{with a traditional}} cleaner are caused by muscle activity and exposure to vibrations. Exposure to vibrations during cleaning declines when a straight spraying lance is used instead of a bowed spraying lance. An accumulator and a better-balanced rotating nozzle further reduce vibrations. A broad-spraying nozzle hardly vibrates, but its cleaning capacity is insufficient for very dirty areas. Muscle activity can be reduced by using a fingertip handle and a straight spraying lance. The best high pressure cleaning equipment in this study had an accumulator, fingertip handle, straight spraying lance and a better-balanced rotating nozzle. For well <b>soaked</b> farrowing <b>rooms</b> or nursery rooms a broad nozzle can be used. For farms with 300 sows and 2160 finishers annual costs for robot cleaning were ¿ 1170 higher than for manual cleaning. A cleaning robot might be profitable for farms with more than 6750 finishing pigs. However: many assumptions had to be made, since several variables were unknown. Other benefits of robot cleaning are: less unpleasant work and health risks, easier labour organization and better image on the labour-market. Cleanability is affected by layout of the buildings and pens, food composition, feeding regime and material choice. Concrete floors and walls must be smooth. Coatings can make them smoother and keep them smoother, as they protect them against chemical and physical influences. It is easier to clean stainless steel than to clean galvanized metal. Surfaces must be flat and accessible for the water jet. Walls must be solid, without bars or pipes, and round pipes {{are more difficult to}} clean than diamond-shaped pipes. Seams or crack must be avoided or repaired. The cleanability of many components in the pens or in the stable would improve if swing-back constructions were applied...|$|R

The surface roughness, rocking curve width, and transport properties {{showed that the}} SRO film grown on the SrTiO 3 (111) substrates was of high quality. We compared basically the growth mode, transport properties, surface morphology, and magnetic properties of these films with the SRO film grown on the SrTiO 3 (001) substrate with different structure deformation.

We found that simply increasing the BHF soak time worked very well for the STO (111) substrate without resorting to a more complicated method [17, 18].

40|$|A {{sensitive}} and fast-responding membrane-free amperometric gas sensor is described, {{consisting of a}} small filter paper foil <b>soaked</b> with a <b>room</b> temperature ionic liquid (RTIL), upon which three electrodes are screen printed with carbon ink, using a suitable mask. It {{takes advantage of the}} high electrical conductivity and negligible vapour pressure of RTILs as well as their easy immobilization into a porous and inexpensive supporting material such as paper. Moreover, thanks to a careful control of the preparation procedure, a very close contact between the RTIL and electrode material can be achieved so as to allow gaseous analytes to undergo charge transfer just as soon as they reach the three-phase sites where the electrode material, paper supported RTIL and gas phase meet. Thus, the adverse effect on recorded currents of slow steps such as analyte diffusion and dissolution in a solvent is avoided. To evaluate the performance of this device, it was used as a wall-jet amperometric detector for flow injection analysis of 1 -butanethiol vapours, adopted as the model gaseous analyte, present in headspace samples in equilibrium with aqueous solutions at controlled concentrations. With this purpose, the RTIL soaked paper electrochemical detector (RTIL-PED) was assembled by using 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide as the wicking RTIL and printing the working electrode with carbon ink doped with cobalt(II) phthalocyanine, to profit from its ability to electrocatalyze thiol oxidation. The results obtained were quite satisfactory (detection limit: 0. 5 mu M; dynamic range: 2 - 200 mu M, both referring to solution concentrations; correlation coefficient: 0. 998; repeatability: +/- 7 % RSD; long-term stability: 9 %), thus suggesting the possible use of this device for manifold applications.

30|$|Basket heating {{apparatus}} {{consists of a}} container (basket) shaped as a cube, a cylinder or a sphere, made of wire mesh to hold the sample, an oven to maintain the temperature and a thermocouple to measure the temperature inside the sample. Measuring the runaway temperature involves the following steps: charging the basket with a sample, inserting the thermocouple {{in the middle of}} the basket, then placing this basket inside a preheated oven and finally recording the temperature with a data logger (Wang et al. 2006). The objective of this method is to determine the critical oven temperature that gives rise to self-heating. This approach assumes a single Arrhenius reaction rate, constant and isotropic material properties, and no water evaporation (Wang et al. 2006; Drysdale 1985). The measurements are normally analysed using the Frank-Kamenetskii theory as explained later in this review. Bowes et al. implemented this method to measure the self-heating and ignition temperature of sawdust for different concentrations of oxygen (Bowes & Thomas 1966). This method is time and material consuming since a great number of tests must be performed to obtain the critical temperature. Moreover, locating the critical temperature is not straightforward. Worden attempted to implement this method to study the spontaneous ignition of cotton soaked with linseed oil, however, the critical temperature could not be determined due to difficulties in ascertaining the sub-critical conditions (Worden 2011). In other words, using boiled oil (oil with cobalt accelerant), Worden could not find conditions that did not ignite. This leads one to conclude that there is no safe quantity of rags soaked with boiled linseed oil, and that even a single oil <b>soaked</b> rag at <b>room</b> temperature can self-heat. In practical terms, these findings question the classical theory of self-heating that stipulates the existence of a sub-critical condition for which a material does not self-ignite. The classical theory of self-heating does not cover self-ignition reaction involving radical and catalytic reactions. New theoretical and numerical treatments remain to be developed for spontaneous ignition induced by radical and catalytic reactions.|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of space mission designing, {{physical}} and chemical systems which regenerate the resources with production "in situ" of air, food and water are increasing their importance. The MELiSSA (Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative) project aims at developing of an artificial ecosystem of microorganisms and higher plants able to support {{the life of a}} crew during long-term space missions. Particular attention has been given to the choice of plant species and technologies for their processing. Among several candidate species, potato, soybean and two wheat species were selected. Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is an important crop wordwide because of its high nutrient content and because of the main ways it can be processed. Within a closed system for a space mission, yield, energy consumption, sensorial acceptability and numerous other factors must be taken into account. For these reasons, the simultaneous production of soymilk and okara was considered optimal: it allows high nutrient recovery without excessive energy consumption. In order to identify optimal parameters for soybean processing into milk and okara, water for <b>soaking</b> at <b>room</b> temperature was chosen: it provides long times but low nutrient leaking in the water and no energy expenditure. Optimal processing parameters were seeds milling in water at room temperature and extraction by 30 min boiling; next steps were filtration to separate aqueous extract from the pulp and milk sanification by boiling for 15 min. Regarding sensorial aspects, consumers do not always appreciate soymilk, but it is possible to improve taste by adding sugar and vanilla. A study with non-expert panelists showed that salt and vanilla sugar addition fails to mask the typical bean aroma but it can improve taste up to global levels of pleasantness comparable to market soymilk. The possibility of soybean production cycle shortening was evaluated: for this purpose effects on seeds and transformed products were studied. Harvest of immature seeds results great management and economic benefits and, from a nutritional point of view, it is possible to obtained processed products with lower phytic acid content. On the other hand, {{it is well known that}} the accumulation of dry matter and nutrients in soybeans seeds increases with advancing of maturation steps. For dry matter, this trend was mitigated with transformation but for fat and protein the highest concentration was observed in soymilk and okara from seeds at complete maturation so, optimal harvest moment within a Life Support System is commercial ripeness. Based on this preliminary information, nutritional and compositional comparison, among four different cultivars of soybean seeds and their derived products were performed. Influence of hydroponic cultivation in controlled environment (simulation of a Life Support System in the space) was evaluated, too. Hydroponic cultivation in controlled environment is not only a method to produce food in space, but also a system to increase lipid, fiber and mineral accumulation in soy seeds. Hydroponic cultivation in controlled environment determined different performances compared to open field cultivation and, for this reason, selecting optimal cultivar, only data from experimental cultivation must be considered. In particular during soymilk and okara production, seeds cultivation system did not significantly modify aqueous extract composition but only residue pulp characteristics. The choice of the best cultivar will be contextualized within the diet of the astronauts: good protein and fiber values were observed in transformed products from Atlantic seeds but, if you need a higher fat content, you will choose other cultivars such as Cresir or Regir. After this stage of the study about food production and preparation on Earth, a second phase with the study of technology in the absence of gravity and the evaluation of space environment effect on biological processes will perform...|$|R
