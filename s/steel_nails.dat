25|$|The Case of Two Nails (雙釘記): Bao Zheng {{investigated}} a man's suspicious death whose cause {{had been}} ruled as natural. After an autopsy, his coroner confirmed the earlier report {{that there was}} no injury to the whole body. At home, the coroner discussed the case with his wife, who mentioned that someone could force long <b>steel</b> <b>nails</b> into the brain without injuring the body. The next day, the coroner indeed found a long nail, and the dead man's widow was arrested; she confessed to adultery and mariticide. Afterwards, Bao Zheng began to question the coroner's wife and learned that the coroner is her second husband, as her first husband had died. Bao ordered his guards to go to the cemetery and unearth her first husband's coffin. Sure enough, there was also a nail driven into the skull.|$|E

40|$|Internal {{fixations}} provide fast healing {{but their}} failure remains problematic to patients. Here, we report an experimental study in failure of three typical cases of metals: a bent intramedullary stainless <b>steel</b> <b>nail,</b> a broken exterior pure Ti plate, {{and a broken}} intramedullary stainless <b>steel</b> <b>nail.</b> Characterization of the bent nail indicates that those metals are vulnerable to corrosion with the evidence of increased surface roughness and embrittlement. Depredated surface of the Ti plate resulted debris particles in the surrounding tissue of 15. 2 ± 6. 5 μm in size. Nanoparticles were observed in transmission electron microscope. The electron diffraction pattern of the debris indicates a combination of nanocrystalline and amorphous phases.

40|$|AbstractThere {{are a lot}} of {{traditional}} wooden houses, temples and shrines in Japan. These traditional wooden structures have already been standing for a long time. Many of these structural members and joints have suffered from biodeteriorations induced by fungi, termites and so on. It is difficult to know the residual strength of decayed structural members and joints. Therefore {{it is very important to}} evaluate the residual strength of structural members and joints for house in use for long term safety, and decide when repair and replacement of the members should be undertaken. The objective of this study is to evaluate the shear strength of nail joints attacked by fungi, which are often used in the wooden houses. In this study, we prepared the partial decayed specimens embedded by nails, and evaluated the shear strength. Those specimens were locally attacked by brown rot fungi (Fomitopsis palustris) for 7 weeks and evaluated the shear strength. In the case of <b>steel</b> <b>nail</b> joint, the shear strength of the decayed wood was higher than those of the sound wood. On the other hand, the shear strength of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>nail</b> joint was slightly decreased by the fungus attack...|$|R

50|$|Japanese ships at {{the time}} were built with wooden planks and <b>steel</b> <b>nails,</b> which rusted in {{seawater}} after some time in service. The ships were built in a curved pentagonal shape with light wood for maximum speeds for their boarding tactics, but it undermined their capability to quickly change direction. Also, they were somewhat susceptible to capsizing in choppy seas and seastorms. The hulls of Japanese ships were not strong enough to support the weight and recoil of cannons. Rarely did Japanese ships have cannons, and those that did usually hung them from overhead beams with ropes and cloth. Instead, the Japanese relied heavily on their muskets and blades.|$|E
50|$|Another nailing {{system is}} the soil nail and root {{technology}} (SNART). Here, <b>steel</b> <b>nails</b> are inserted very rapidly into a slope by percussion, vibration or screw methods. Grid spacing is typically 0.8 to 1.5 m, nails are 25 to 50 mm in diameter and may be as long as 20 m. Nails are installed perpendicular to and through the failure plane, and are designed to resist bending and shear (rather than tension) using geotechnical engineering principles. Potential failure surfaces less than 2 m deep normally require the nails to be wider near the top, which may be achieved with steel plates fastened at the nail heads. Plant roots often form an effective and aesthetic facing to prevent soil loss between the nails.|$|E
30|$|Historically {{recommended}} instrumentation {{for performing}} adenoidectomy has varied from the surgeon’s fingernail, a <b>steel</b> <b>nail,</b> cutting or biting forceps, adenotomes and adenoid curettes (Jonas et al. 2007).

40|$|Glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) {{materials}} provide practical {{solutions to}} corrosion and site-maneuvering problems for civil infrastructures using conventional steel bars as reinforcements. In this study, {{the feasibility of}} using GFRP soil nails for slope stabilization is evaluated. The GFRP soil nail system consists of a GFRP pipe installed by the double-grouting technique. Two field-scale pullout tests were performed at a slope site. Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, strain gauges, linear variable displacement transformers (LVDTs), and a load cell were used to measure axial strain distributions and pullout force-displacement relationships during testing. The pullout test results of <b>steel</b> soil <b>nails</b> at another slope site are also presented for comparison. It is proven that the load transfer mechanisms of GFRP and <b>steel</b> soil <b>nails</b> have certain difference. Based on these test results, a simplified model using a hyperbolic shear stress-strain relationship was developed to describe the pullout performance of the GFRP soil nail. A parametric study was conducted using this model to study some factors affecting the pullout behavior of GFRP soil nails, including nail diameter, shear resistance of soil-grout interface, and ratio of interface shear coefficient to the Young's modulus of the nail. The {{results indicate that the}} GFRP soil nail may exhibit excessive pullout displacement and thus a lower allowable pullout resistance than with the <b>steel</b> soil <b>nail.</b> © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} is to study the behaviour of bamboo charcoal in urine treatment and corrosion inhibition. The analysis of Scanning Electron Microscopy was utilised to analyse the microstructure and macrostructure pores within bamboo charcoal. The images obtained from the analysis showed that bamboo charcoal had {{a large amount of}} pores and hence had high adsorption capacity. Besides that, analysis of X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) showed that bamboo charcoal consisted of several minerals. Potassium, calcium, manganese, iron, copper and zinc were found in bamboo charcoal. In order to carry out the urine treatment process, a simple filtration apparatus was set up in which bamboo charcoal was the main adsorbent. Human urine samples which were filtrated or infiltrated were then analysed by spread-plate method. The result of the spread-plate method showed that the amount of bacteria colonies in untreated urine sample decreased after treatment. Bamboo charcoal had efficiently adsorbed and prevented the growth of bacteria in the urine samples. <b>Steel</b> <b>nails</b> and bamboo charcoal were prepared for corrosion process. The Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was used to analyse the <b>steel</b> <b>nails.</b> The percentage inhibition efficiency of bamboo charcoal was also calculated. The result from EIS showed that the more bamboo charcoal used in the water, the lower the corrosion rate of <b>steel</b> <b>nails</b> while the result of calculation for percentage inhibition efficiency showed that the more bamboo charcoal used, the higher the percentage of inhibition efficiency. As a summary, this study showed that bamboo charcoal was a good adsorbent in urine treatment and an efficient corrosion inhibitor...|$|E
40|$|Background: Elastic intra-medullary nailing {{is a new}} {{technique}} for treatment of various paediatric fractures. The use of these titanium nails is preferred over conventional stainless <b>steel</b> <b>nails</b> used in the past. Method: Sixty patients with various long bone fractures underwent operative treatment with elastic intra-medullary nails. The mean age was ten years and the mean follow-up period was 28 months. Results: All children achieved union in a mean time of 10 weeks. Few technical complications were seen earlier on in the series. Two cases developed infection which resolved with antibiotics. Insignificant limb length discrepancy was seen in 3 children, but this remains a potential problem which needs close follow-up until skeletal maturity. Conclusion: Elastic intra-medullary nailing of long bone fracture is an excellent technique in the surgical treatment of long bone fracture in children. It is safe, less invasive and associated with fewer complications...|$|E
