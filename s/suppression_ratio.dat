50|$|Quantifying {{the burst}} {{suppression}} pattern allows for {{calculation of the}} burst <b>suppression</b> <b>ratio</b> (BSR) by assigning binary values of 0 to bursts and 1 to suppression episodes. Thus, a burst <b>suppression</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1 {{is associated with a}} state of the brain that shows no electrical activity, while a ratio of 0 indicates that the brain is active. The burst <b>suppression</b> <b>ratio</b> measures the amount of time within an interval spent in the suppressed state. This ratio increases as the brain becomes increasingly inactive until the brain's EEG signal flatlines, represented by a burst <b>suppression</b> <b>ratio</b> equal to 1.

50|$|There are {{alternatives}} to traditional types of DFB lasers. Traditionally, DFBs are antireflection coated {{on one side}} of the cavity and coated for high reflectivity on the other side (AR/HR). In this case the grating forms the distributed mirror on the antireflection coated side, while the semiconductor facet on the high reflectivity side forms the other mirror. These lasers generally have higher output power since the light is taken from the AR side, and the HR side prevents power being lost from the back side. Unfortunately, during the manufacturing of the laser and the cleaving of the facets, it is virtually impossible to control at which point in the grating the laser cleaves to form the facet. So sometimes the laser HR facet forms at the crest of the grating, sometimes on the slope. Depending on the phase of the grating and the optical mode, the laser output spectrum can vary. Frequently, the phase of the highly reflective side occurs at a point where two longitudinal modes have the same cavity gain, and thus the laser operates at two modes simultaneously. Thus such AR/HR lasers have to be screened at manufacturing and parts that are multimode or have poor side mode <b>suppression</b> <b>ratio</b> (SMSR) have to be scrapped. Additionally, the phase of the cleave affects the wavelength, and thus controlling the output wavelength of a batch of lasers in manufacturing can be a challenge.|$|E
50|$|In {{fiber optics}} and telecommunications, an index-matching {{material}} {{may be used}} in conjunction with pairs of mated connectors or with mechanical splices to reduce signal reflected in the guided mode (known as return loss) (see: Optical fiber connector). Without the use of an index-matching material, Fresnel reflections will occur at the smooth end faces of a fiber unless there is no fiber-air interface or other significant mismatch in refractive index. These reflections may be as high as -14 dB (i.e., 14 dB below the optical power of the incident signal). When the reflected signal returns to the transmitting end, it may be reflected again and return to the receiving end at a level that is (28 plus twice the fiber loss) dB below the direct signal. The reflected signal will also be delayed by twice the delay time introduced by the fiber. The twice-reflected, delayed signal superimposed on the direct signal may noticeably degrade an analog baseband intensity-modulated video signal. Conversely, for digital transmission, the reflected signal will often have no practical effect on the detected signal seen at the decision point of the digital optical receiver except in marginal cases where bit-error ratio is significant. However, certain digital transmitters such as those employing a Distributed Feedback Laser may be affected by back reflection and then fall outside specifications such as Side Mode <b>Suppression</b> <b>Ratio,</b> potentially degrading system bit error ratio, so networking standards intended for DFB lasers may specify a back-reflection tolerance such as -10 dB for transmitters so that they remain within specification even without index matching. This back-reflection tolerance might be achieved using an optical isolator or by way of reduced coupling efficiency.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The bispectral index (BIS) is {{a complex}} EEG {{parameter}} which integrates several disparate descriptors of the EEG into a single variable. One of the subparameters incorporated in the BIS is the <b>suppression</b> <b>ratio,</b> quantifying the percentage of suppression during burst suppression pattern. The exact algorithm used to synthetize {{the information to the}} BIS value is unpublished and still unknown. This study provides insight into the integration of the <b>suppression</b> <b>ratio</b> into the BIS algorithm. METHODS: EEG data of 10 healthy volunteers during propofol infusion were analyzed. Propofol concentrations were ramped up to 4 predetermined concentrations (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, or 12 microg/ml) using a computer controlled infusion pump (STANPUMP). EEG recordings were performed with an Aspect A- 1000 EEG monitor (Version 3. 22). The relationship of the processed EEG variables bispectral index and <b>suppression</b> <b>ratio,</b> calculated by the Aspect A- 1000 monitor, was analyzed. RESULTS: Up to 40 % <b>suppression</b> <b>ratio</b> the average BIS values remained constant regardless of suppression ratios (r = 0. 13). Beyond a <b>suppression</b> <b>ratio</b> of 40 %, BIS and <b>suppression</b> <b>ratio</b> were invariably linearly correlated (r = - 1).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Anaesthesiologists need {{parameters}} {{that measure}} {{the depth of}} anaesthesia. In {{the context of this}} need, the present study investigated in rats how two variables from the electroencephalogram, the burst <b>suppression</b> <b>ratio</b> and effective correlation dimension correlated with a measure of anaesthetic depth as measured in the strength of a noxious withdrawal reflex. METHODS: Eight rats were exposed to different inspiratory concentrations of sevoflurane, each rat in two separate experiments. In the first experiment, spontaneously breathing animals could move freely and no painful stimuli were applied. In the second experiment, in mechanically ventilated restrained anaesthetized rats, the withdrawal reflex was measured every 80 s. In both experiments the electroencephalogram was continuously recorded. The concentration in the effector compartment was estimated using a first order two compartment model. Correlation dimension was computed following the Grassberger/Procaccia/Takens approach with optimized parameter settings to achieve maximum sensitivity to anaesthetic drug effects and enable real-time computation. The Hill, equation was fitted to the data, describing the effect as a function of sevoflurane concentration. RESULTS: Good correlations of Depth of Anaesthesia with correlation dimension as well as burst <b>suppression</b> <b>ratio</b> were established in both types of experiments. Arousal by noxious stimuli decreased burst <b>suppression</b> <b>ratio</b> and increased correlation dimension. The effective sevoflurane concentration associated with 50 % of the maximum effect (C 50) was higher in experiment II (stimulation) than in experiment I (no stimulation) : i. e. for correlation dimension 2. 18 % vs. 0. 60 % and for burst <b>suppression</b> <b>ratio</b> 3. 07 % vs. 1. 73 %. The slope factors were: gammaCD = 4. 15 vs. gammaCD = 1. 73 and gammaBSR = 5. 2 vs. gammaBSR = 5. 4. Correlation dimension and burst <b>suppression</b> <b>ratio</b> both correlated with the strength of the withdrawal reflex with correlation coefficients of 0. 46 and 0. 66 respectively (P < 0. 001).
