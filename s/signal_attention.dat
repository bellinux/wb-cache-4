The theoretical predictions are then tested in laboratory experiments. It is found that subjects' payoffs (i) decrease as noise increases, and (ii) are lower than the theoretical maximum for small noise, but exceed it for large noise.

Previous studies have investigated BC prediction in telephone-style dialogs from prosodic cues. In contrast, we consider spontaneous face-to-face dialogs.

In addition, we find that mutual gaze occurs significantly more often during visual BCs. Moreover, vocal BCs {{are more likely to be}} timed during pauses in the speaker's speech...|$|E

With the Principle of Relativity and Coulomb's Law as formal starting points and the minimum of mathematics needed for understanding, the derivation of a classical electromagnetic theory of signal reception is first given. The agreement between that classical theory and a recent NMR experiment is then presented, leading to proof that, except for the highest field imaging experiments, {{there is no significant}} contribution of radio waves to the <b>signal.</b> <b>Attention</b> is drawn to the very different properties of the near and far energy, momenta, and fields inherent in the derivation.

Finally, the author speculates on some of the intriguing relationships found in the classical electrodynamics of NMR signal reception and attempts to relate them to a common quantum electrodynamic precept of near field interaction: that the free induction decay voltage present at the terminals of an open-circuit receiving coil is based on an exchange of virtual photons between the nuclei in a sample and the free electrons in a receiving coil. 9 2009 Crown in the right of Canada.

40|$|The {{human body}} plays an {{important}} role in face-to-face interactions (Knapp & Hall, 2010; McNeill, 1992). We use our bodies to regulate turns, to display attitudes and to <b>signal</b> <b>attention</b> (Scheflen, 1964). Unconsciously, the body also reflects our affective and mental states (Ekman & Friesen, 1969). There is a long history of research into the bodily behaviors that correlate with the social and affective state of a person, in particular in interaction with others (Argyle, 2010; Dittmann, 1987; Mehrabian, 1968). We will refer to these behaviors as bodily social signals. These social and affective cues can be detected and interpreted by observing the human body’s posture and movement (Harrigan, 2008; Kleinsmith & Bianchi-Berthouze, 2013). Automatic observation and analysis has applications such as the detection of driver fatigue and deception, the analysis of interest and mood in interactions with robot companions, and in the interpretation of higher-level phenomena such as mimicry and turn-taking. In this chapter, we will discuss various bodily social signals, and how to analyze and recognize them automatically. Human motion can be studied on many levels, from the physical level involving muscles and joints, to the level of interpreting a person’s full-body actions and intentions (Poppe, 2007, 2010; Jiang et al., 2013). We will focus on automatically analyzing movements with a relatively short time scale, such as a gesture or posture shift. In the first section, we will discuss the different ways of measurement and coding, both from motion capture data and images and video. The recorded data can subsequently be interpreted in terms of social signals. In the second section, we address the automatic recognition of several bodily social signals. We will conclude the chapter with a discussion of challenges and directions of future work...|$|E

Some search displays contained the target or a nontarget object that matched either the target color or its shape among 3 nonmatching distractors. In other displays, the target and a partially target-matching nontarget object appeared together. N 2 pc results demonstrated that the initial stage of attentional object selection is controlled by local feature-specific <b>signals.</b> <b>Attention</b> is allocated in parallel and independently to objects with target-matching features during this early stage, irrespective of whether another target-matching object is simultaneously present elsewhere.
