5|$|Nonprofit {{organizations}} {{and government agencies}} have <b>special</b> <b>requirements</b> to show, in financial statements and reports, how money is spent, rather than how much profit was earned. Unlike profit oriented businesses, which use a single set of self-balancing accounts (or general ledger), nonprofits can {{have more than one}} general ledger (or fund), depending on their financial reporting requirements. An accountant for such an entity must be able to produce reports detailing the expenditures and revenues for each of the organization's individual funds, and reports that summarize the organization's financial activities across all of its funds.|$|E

During Campaign Toan Thang, on 24 June 1969, when People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) troops had scattered FAN, <b>Special</b> <b>Requirement</b> 8's 317 men manned its guns and held its ground. An evacuation of FAN dependents via helicopter sapped the Neutralist will to resist, and they abandoned Moung Soui. Encircled and outnumbered by their attackers, under tank and artillery fire, the senior Thai officer at the site had to be ordered to withdraw. On 26 June, the Thais were helilifted out in Operation Swan Lake. <b>Special</b> <b>Requirement</b> 8 was disbanded once {{it was back in}} Thailand.|$|R

25|$|The {{building}} design was reviewed {{to incorporate the}} necessary protection for the UK's foreign intelligence gathering agency. This includes overall increased security, extensive computer suites, technical areas, bomb blast protection, emergency back-up systems and protection against electronic eavesdropping. While the details and cost of construction have been released, about {{ten years after the}} original National Audit Office (NAO) report was written, some of the service's <b>special</b> <b>requirements</b> remain classified. The NAO report Thames House and Vauxhall Cross has certain details omitted, describing in detail the cost and problems of certain modifications, but not what these are. Rob Humphrey's London: The Rough Guide suggests one of these omitted modifications is a tunnel beneath the Thames to Whitehall. The NAO put the final cost at £135.05m for site purchase and the basic building, or £152.6m including the service's <b>special</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|E

25|$|Before a {{recipient}} receives a transfusion, compatibility testing between {{donor and recipient}} blood must be done. The first step before a transfusion is given is to type and screen the recipient's blood. Typing of recipient's blood determines the ABO and Rh status. The sample is then screened for any alloantibodies that may react with donor blood. It takes about 45 minutes to complete (depending on the method used). The blood bank scientist also checks for <b>special</b> <b>requirements</b> of the patient (e.g. need for washed, irradiated or CMV negative blood) {{and the history of}} the patient to see if they have previously identified antibodies and any other serological anomalies.|$|E
25|$|Using the Land Books (jarðarbøkur) it is speculated, {{that the}} number of {{inhabitants}} in Sørvág in the 17th century was around fifty. In the first census in the Faroes in 1801 the number of inhabitants in Sørvág had risen to a mere 86. In 1855 the number of inhabitants was 163. The reason for this slow progress is due to the <b>special</b> <b>requirements</b> for marriage, that were law in the Faroes. The law said, that in order to marry you would need to own land or have demonstrated that you were a faithful servant to someone who owned land. It was only the wealthy farmers who had a substantial amount of land, and therefore the birthrate in the Faroes was very low until this law was abolished.|$|E
25|$|After {{each country}} has rehearsed, the {{delegation}} meets with the show's artistic {{director in the}} video viewing room. Here, they watch the footage of the rehearsal just performed. At this point the Head of Delegation may make known any <b>special</b> <b>requirements</b> needed for the performance, and request them from the host broadcaster. Following this meeting, the delegation hold a press conference where members of the accredited press may pose them questions. The rehearsals and press conferences are held in parallel; so one country holds its press conference, while the next one is in the auditorium rehearsing. A printed summary of the questions and answers which emerge from the press conferences is produced by the host press office, and distributed to journalists' pigeon-holes.|$|E

25|$|In 1950 a {{diesel-electric}} locomotive {{was built for}} use in the melting shop of Templeborough steelworks. The duty had <b>special</b> <b>requirements</b> for a locomotive to fit through a small opening and around tight curves while being powerful enough to haul heavy ‘Casting Cars’. The weight of the locomotive had to be high to give better grip. The design featured a Paxman engine and British Thompson-Houston electric equipment powering and 0-4-0 chassis. The first locomotive (Works number 2480) left the works at the end of 1950 with a second (No. 2481) leaving in early 1951. No.2480 was displayed and demonstrated before final delivery while No.2481 was delivered direct from the works (a journey of about 1 mile). Both locomotives survived to be preserved in the late 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The long, {{cold winter}} has a {{profound}} impact on almost every aspect of life in Russia. It affects where and how long people live and work, what kinds of crops are grown, and where they are grown (no part of the country has a year-round growing season). The length and severity of the winter, together with the sharp fluctuations in the mean summer and winter temperatures, impose <b>special</b> <b>requirements</b> on many branches of the economy. In regions of permafrost, buildings must be constructed on pilings, machinery must be made of specially tempered steel, and transportation systems must be engineered to perform reliably in extremely low and extremely high temperatures. In addition, during extended periods of darkness and cold, there are increased demands for energy, health care, and textiles.|$|E
25|$|The Left Bipod Foam Ramp is an {{approximately}} three-foot (one-meter) long aerodynamic component made {{entirely of}} foam. The foam, not normally {{considered to be}} a structural material, is required to bear some aerodynamic loads. Because of these <b>special</b> <b>requirements,</b> the casting-in-place and curing of the ramps may be performed only by a senior technician. The bipod ramp (having left and right sides) was originally designed to reduce aerodynamic stresses around the bipod attachment points at the external tank, but it was proven unnecessary {{in the wake of the}} accident and was removed from the external tank design for tanks flown after STS-107 (another foam ramp along the liquid oxygen line was also later removed from the tank design to eliminate it as a foam debris source, after analysis and tests proved this change safe).|$|E
