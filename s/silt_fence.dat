5000|$|Some {{government}} jurisdictions in the United States recommend {{or require}} the use of a reinforced fence, sometimes called a [...] "super" [...] <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> or an enhanced <b>silt</b> <b>fence,</b> on some construction sites. This design uses filter fabric reinforced by a wire mesh or chain link fence. The metal backing gives the fence increased strength to resist the weight of soil and water which may be trapped by the fence in a large drainage area, and discourages construction site operators from driving vehicles over the fence. However, an improper installation of a super <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> can create an inadvertent sediment basin when the filter fabric becomes clogged. This typically causes flooding and increased downstream pollution. Most super <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> specifications are out-dated, requiring the trenching installation method, which {{has been shown to be}} highly susceptible to [...] "washing out" [...] under the fabric due to improper back-filling and inadequate compaction.|$|E

5000|$|Sediment is {{captured}} by <b>silt</b> <b>fences</b> primarily through ponding {{of water and}} settling, rather than filtration by the fabric. Sand and silt tends to clog the fabric, and then the sediments settle in the temporary pond.|$|R
50|$|<b>Silt</b> <b>fences</b> {{are often}} {{perimeter}} controls, typically used {{in combination with}} sediment basins and sediment traps, as well as erosion controls, which are designed to retain sediment in place where soil is being disturbed by construction processes (i.e., land grading and other earthworks).|$|R
50|$|Construction sites {{typically}} implement simple {{measures to}} reduce pollution and runoff. Firstly, sediment or <b>silt</b> <b>fences</b> are erected around construction sites {{to reduce the}} amount of sediment and large material draining into the nearby water body. Secondly, laying grass or straw along the border of construction sites also work to reduce nonpoint source pollution.|$|R

5000|$|Straw bales are {{sometimes}} used for sediment control at construction sites. [...] However, bales are often ineffective in protecting {{water quality and}} are maintenance-intensive. For these reasons the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and various state agencies recommend use of alternative sediment control practices where possible, such as <b>silt</b> <b>fences,</b> fiber rolls and geotextiles.|$|R
25|$|Filtration is the {{equilibrium}} soil-to-geotextile interaction {{that allows for}} adequate liquid flow without soil loss, across {{the plane of the}} geotextile over a service lifetime compatible with the application under consideration.

50|$|Erosion and {{sediment}} control - During excavation of sites, Mammoth utilizes {{an array of}} erosion {{and sediment}} control devices. Culverts, <b>silt</b> <b>fences,</b> break dams, and ditches control surface water runoff, and prevent sediment from escaping the site. Proper planning helps Mammoth employ these measures so as to limit the effect its drilling activities has on the environment.|$|R
50|$|Since 1998, static slicing the {{material}} {{into the ground}} {{has proven to be}} the most efficient and most effective installation method because slicing maintains the soil {{on both sides of the}} fence, and is conducive to proper compaction—which is critical to performance, as well. In 2000 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) co-sponsored <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> efficacy field research through its Environmental Technology Verification Program, and in general, the report found the static slicing method to be highly effective, and efficient. <b>Silt</b> <b>fence</b> effectiveness is best determined by how many hundreds of pounds of sediment are contained behind a given <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> after a storm event, and not turbidity, etc. as sediment-retention is the end goal, and not a water-quality measurement used in erosion control, for instance. Silt fences may perform poorly for a variety of reasons, including improper location (e.g. placing fence where it will not pond runoff water), improper installation (e.g. failure to adequately embed and backfill the lower edge of fabric in the soil) and lack of maintenance—fabric falling off of the posts, or posts knocked down. A <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> top-full of sediment may need maintenance/replacement, but it is a huge success. The fabric may become damaged with holes and tears if construction materials are stored next to or on top of the fence. During various phases of construction at a site, a <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> may be removed relocated and reinstalled multiple times. It may be difficult to maintain effectiveness of a <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> under such operating conditions. Location of fences in areas with high flows may lead to fence failures when the installation is not adequately back-filled and properly compacted, and/or the post-spacing is inadequate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Silt</b> <b>fence</b> fabrics (geotextiles) {{tested in}} {{laboratory}} settings have {{shown to be}} effective at trapping sediment particles. Although {{there have been few}} field tests of silt fences installed at construction sites, these tests have shown generally poor results. (Effectiveness testing involved measurements for both total suspended solids and turbidity.) Other studies and articles about <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> usage and practice document problems with installation and maintenance, implying poor performance.|$|E
5000|$|A typical fence {{consists}} {{of a piece of}} synthetic filter fabric (also called a geotextile) stretched between a series of wooden or metal fence stakes along a horizontal contour level. The stakes are installed on the downhill side of the fence, and the bottom edge of the fabric can be trenched into the soil and backfilled on the uphill side, although it is quite difficult to move the trenched [...] "spoil" [...] from the downside to the upside of the trench. The design/placement of the <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> should create a pooling of runoff, which then allows sedimentation to occur. Water can seep through the <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> fabric, but the fabric often becomes [...] "blocked off" [...] with fine soil particles (all sediment-retention devices have this challenge, and none of them [...] "filter" [...] storm water for very long). A few hours after a storm event, the fabric can be [...] "disturbed" [...] in order to dislodge the fines, and allow clean water to flow through. Depending on the protected watershed and erosion, larger soil particles will settle out, ultimately filling the <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> {{to the top of the}} structure; requiring another <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> above or below it (creating a new ponding area), or for the <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> to be removed, the sediment removed or spread out, and a new fence installed. The fence is not designed to concentrate or channel stormwater. The fence is installed on a site before soil disturbance begins, and is placed down-slope from the disturbance area.|$|E

5000|$|The ICC project employs {{teams of}} [...] "stormbusters" [...] {{to put down}} straw and grass seed and erect plastic <b>silt</b> <b>fences</b> in {{construction}} areas before it rains to prevent erosion. Solar-powered stream monitors give Baker and enforcement personnel a real-time reading of water conditions. Paved storm-water ditches in older neighborhoods abutting the highway {{will be replaced by}} grass-lined swales that will filter and cool the water before it enters tributaries.|$|R
5000|$|Snow {{dump site}} {{selection}} {{is based on}} the availability of suitable land and pollution prevention factors that may include distances from lakes and streams, installation of <b>silt</b> <b>fences,</b> soil and aquifer type, and other factors. Some sites may use filters and settling ponds to help prevent the pollution from spreading. Occasionally an excessive amount of snow must be dumped and is sometimes allowed to be legally dumped into water bodies on an [...] "emergency only" [...] basis.|$|R
5000|$|Some state {{agencies}} recommend an installation technique called [...] "static slicing" [...] as an improved method for ensuring effectiveness and longevity of a <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> system on a construction site. The technique involves inserting a narrow blade {{into the soil}} with a wedge-type point on its tip to slightly disrupt the soil upward, while simultaneously inserting the <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> fabric into the slot with a moving pivot, while the machine is moving forward. This step is followed by mechanical soil compaction, setting of fence posts, and attaching the fabric.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>silt</b> <b>fence,</b> {{sometimes}} (misleadingly) {{called a}} [...] "filter fence," [...] {{is a temporary}} sediment control device used on construction sites to protect water quality in nearby streams, rivers, lakes and seas from sediment (loose soil) in stormwater runoff. Silt fences are widely used on construction sites in North America and elsewhere, due to their low cost and simple design. However, their effectiveness in controlling sediment can be limited, due to problems with poor installation, proper placement, and/or inadequate maintenance.|$|E
40|$|Erosion and {{sediment}} controls on construction sites minimize environmental impacts from sediment-laden stormwater runoff. <b>Silt</b> <b>fence,</b> a widely specified perimeter control practice on construction projects used to retain sediment on-site, has limited performance-based testing data. <b>Silt</b> <b>fence</b> failures and resultant sediment losses {{are often the}} result of structural failure. To better understand <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> performance, researchers at the Auburn University-Erosion and Sediment Control Testing Facility (AU-ESCTF) have evaluated three <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> options to determine possible shortcomings using standardized full-scale testing methods. These methods subject <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> practices to simulated, in-field conditions typically experienced on-site without the variability of field testing or the limited application of small-scale testing. Three different <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> practices were tested to evaluate performance, which included: (1) Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) Trenched <b>Silt</b> <b>Fence,</b> (2) ALDOT Sliced <b>Silt</b> <b>Fence,</b> and (3) Alabama Soil and Water Conservation Committee (AL-SWCC) Trenched <b>Silt</b> <b>Fence.</b> This study indicates that the structural performance of a <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> perimeter control {{is the most important}} performance factor in retaining sediment. The sediment retention performance of these <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> practices was 82. 7 %, 66. 9 % and 90. 5 %, respectively. When exposed to large impoundment conditions, both ALDOT Trench and Sliced <b>Silt</b> <b>Fence</b> practices failed structurally, while the AL-SWCC Trenched <b>Silt</b> <b>Fence</b> did not experience structural failure...|$|E

Construction began on December 31, 2010, and was due to be complete by June 2012. Following a stop-work order in December 2011, the completion date was revised to August.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this project is to {{stabilize}} the abandoned coal storage area and redirect the storm water runoff from sanitary sewer system to the storm drain system. Currently, the existing storm water runoff is directed to a perimeter concrete drainage swale and collected in a containment basin. The collected water is then pumped to a treatment facility and after treatment, is discharged to the Y- 12 sanitary sewer system. The existing drainage swale and collection basin along with <b>silt</b> <b>fencing</b> will be used during aggregate placement and grading to provide erosion and sediment control. Inlet protection will also be installed around existing structures during the storm water diversion construction. This project scope will include the installation of a non-woven geotextile fabric and compacted mineral aggregate base (paving optional) to stabilize the site. The geotextile specifications are provided on the vendor cut sheets in Appendix B. The installation of a storm water collection/retention area will also be installed on the southern side of the site in accordance with EPA Technical Guidance on Implementing the Stormwater Runoff Requirements for federal Projects under Section 438 of the Energy Independence and Security Act. The total area to be disturbed is approximately 2. 5 acres. The order of activities for this Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) will be: (1) post notice of coverage (NOC) in a prominent display near entrance of the site; (2) install rain gauge on site or contact Y- 12 Plant Shift Superintendent daily for Met tower rain gauge readings; (3) install stabilized construction exit on site; (4) install <b>silt</b> <b>fencing</b> along perimeter as indicated on the attached site plan; (5) regrade site; (6) install geotextile fabric and compacted mineral aggregate base; (7) install catch basin inlet protection where required; (8) excavate and lower existing catch basin tops, re-grade and asphalt to drain; and (9) when all disturbed areas are re-stabilized, remove <b>silt</b> <b>fencing</b> and any other temporary erosion control...|$|R
50|$|Erosion {{controls}} {{are used in}} natural areas, agricultural settings or urban environments. In urban areas erosion {{controls are}} often part of stormwater runoff management programs required by local governments. The controls often involve {{the creation of a}} physical barrier, such as vegetation or rock, to absorb some of the energy of the wind or water that is causing the erosion. They also involve building and maintaining storm drains. On construction sites they are often implemented in conjunction with sediment controls such as sediment basins and <b>silt</b> <b>fences.</b>|$|R
40|$|Renewed {{interest}} in land management practices, like conservation tillage techniques on agricultural lands and timber harvesting, prescribed fires and wildfires on forested lands has made it desirable to measure hillslope soil erosion. Measuring soil erosion is generally costly and time consuming requiring expensive equipment, many site visits and laboratory analyses. The objective {{of the study was}} to determine the suitability of silt fences for measuring onsite hillslope erosion. Silt fences are low-cost and easy to install. They commonly are used as an erosion control device for construction projects and therefore generally available. For this study a <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> was installed at the base of an existing long-term hillslope erosion plot at the Agricultural Research Service-Palouse Conservation Field Station, Pullman, WA. Two seasons of erosion data were collected. The <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> was installed by making a concave cavity facing upslope such that runoff could not go around the <b>silt</b> <b>fence.</b> Also, the <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> was folded to form a pocket to collect the sediment and eliminate the possibility of undermining the <b>silt</b> <b>fence.</b> Silt fences were installed across the width of the plot.

40|$|Sediment has {{recently}} become an {{emphasis in the}} EPA NPDES storm water rules due to its impact on habitat in stream channels. Currently <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> is commonly used as BMP for linear construction. A recent national study and limited evaluation of <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> in the field has showed a very low percentage of sediment trapped. Modification to current <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> technology is required that will replace current ineffective <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> with a workable <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> that is effective in trapping sediment and is also economically feasible. We are working under an IPEC-funded grant to develop such a system. A consistent problem with <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> is failure at the toe, allowing release of sediment through undercutting. A geotextile apron, {{an integral part of}} fence, placed in front of the fence can control the lateral flow and resulting undercutting. The lateral flow is further restricted by incorporating flow barriers that will facilitate impoundment of flow thus increasing detention time and trapping efficiency. Our initial field test results indicate that the new design is effective in reducing off-site sediment release, with a high trapping efficiency of over 90 % in most cases. A new pilot mode...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} effort {{focuses on}} improving sediment control practices used at highway construction projects by employing properly designed and correctly installed <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> applications.

40|$|Sediment {{control devices}} (SCDs) are {{critical}} to reducing the contamination of waterways from adjacent construction sites. Perimeter sediment controls retard the flow of surface runoff water originating on site and subsequently reduce solid, nutrient, and metal concentrations suspended in the flowing water. <b>Silt</b> <b>fence</b> is a commonly used SCD comprised of geotextile filter fabric, steel or wood support posts, and wire mesh reinforcement. The Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) uses an extensive amount of <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> every year, and because of high degradation of geotextile in the field, the <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> installations are rarely recycled. This research measures the performance of five SCDs (two types of <b>silt</b> <b>fence,</b> mulch berm, compost sock, and straw bales) at suspended solid, turbidity, nutrient, and metal reduction. A life cycle analysis (LCA) is performed to identify environmental impacts associated with material production, assembly, installation, use on site, and disposal. An impact analysis is performed according to for each SCD. Results of the impact analysis are compared to determine the SCD with lowest overall environmental impact. Results of the SCD performance study show that <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> installations performed the best at reducing suspended solids and turbidity, mulch was best at reducing nutrients, and compost was the best at reducing metal concentrations. The life cycle impact analysis indicates that a mulch berm is the SCD with the lowest overall environmental impact. The impact analysis included global warming potential, acidification, eutrophication, and aquatic toxicity. M. S...|$|E

40|$|The {{first year}} {{was focused on}} {{developing}} new technology for <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> that does not fail under conditions where current <b>silt</b> <b>fence</b> would fail due to undercutting, overtopping of low areas, and excessive lateral flow when installed on steep slopes. An additional focus was on developing models to predict trapping of sediment with existing technologies and with the new technology. Field experiments have been run using existing technology with varying soil types on cross-contour slopes ranging from approximately 1 percent to 14 percent. Using this data, a new technology, given the acronym FAEST, has been developed and preliminary data collected showing it to be very effective under conditions where the current technology fails. Studies are also being conducted {{on the impact of}} flocculants used to control discharge of colloidal particles. These studies indicate that the use of flocculants with the FAESF theoretically has the potential to eliminate most of the sediment currently being discharged through <b>silt</b> <b>fence.</b> Finally, algorithms have been developed with which to predict all of the processes necessary to predict flow and sediment trapping with FAESF {{as well as with the}} current technology.

5000|$|In urban settings, {{managing}} {{areas to}} prevent soil loss and control stormwater flow {{are a few}} of the areas that receive attention. A few practices that are used to manage stormwater before it reaches a channel are retention ponds, filtering systems and wetlands. It is important that stormwater is given an opportunity to infiltrate so that the soil and vegetation can act as a [...] "filter" [...] before the water reaches nearby streams or lakes. In the case of soil erosion prevention, a few common practices include the use of <b>silt</b> <b>fences,</b> landscape fabric with grass seed and hydroseeding.

50|$|Erosion {{controls}} {{have appeared}} since medieval times when farmers realized {{the importance of}} contour farming to protect soil resources. Beginning in the 1950s these agricultural methods became increasingly more sophisticated. In the 1960s some {{state and local governments}} began to focus their efforts on mitigation of construction runoff by requiring builders to implement erosion and sediment controls (ESCs). This included such techniques as: use of straw bales and barriers to slow runoff on slopes, installation of <b>silt</b> <b>fences,</b> programming construction for months that have less rainfall and minimizing extent and duration of exposed graded areas. Montgomery County, Maryland implemented the first local government sediment control program in 1965, and this was followed by a statewide program in Maryland in 1970.|$|R
50|$|Compost berms {{and socks}} are used {{alone or in}} {{conjunction}} with compost blankets to mitigate the impact of high volume water discharges and flows.

Over time, a compost berm simply biodegrades {{and returns to the}} earth. As the name implies, a compost sock is a mesh tube stuffed with compost. Socks stand up better to heavy equipment, can be anchored in place, and are easily removed/reused. If a biodegradable fiber is used for the sock, it can also be left in place to biodegrade. This is rarely if ever practiced, however, since it defeats the idea of the sock.|$|R
