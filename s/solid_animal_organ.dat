During this period, students acquire general {{knowledge that is}} assessed by the criteria in the curricula set by the field experts {{with the help of}} teachers. Students' success is influenced by the ever-evolving technology that is opening up a new world to them and is offering a lot of information on a daily basis. At home as well as in schools, children are constantly exposed to the new interactive devices which also contribute to changing the conventional frontal-based learning. However, each teacher should be able to know which lesson plan and materials are most effective for the students’ knowledge acquisition. With this master's thesis, we wanted to find out the possibilities for using <b>animal</b> <b>organs</b> intended for human consumption in teaching biological contents. First, we examined the legal acts which regulate the use of <b>animal</b> <b>organs</b> in teaching and which <b>animal</b> <b>organs</b> are accessible and permitted to be used, their price and which topics in the curricula of Natural Sciences and Biology allow their usage. With a survey among 126 Slovene teachers of biological contents in primary schools we examined how often teachers use dissection of <b>animal</b> <b>organs</b> and which <b>animal</b> <b>organs</b> are most often used, what discourages or encourages them to use dissection. We also analyzed the link between the use of dissection of <b>animal</b> <b>organs</b> in teaching biological contents and the school environment, teachers’ working experience and their gender. Furthermore, we examined teachers’ opinion {{on the quality of the}} knowledge acquired by observing the dissection of an <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> in comparison to learning with the conventional materials used in teaching biological contents in elementary schools (e. g. plastic models, slides, presentations, course books, videos). The results showed that the dissection of <b>animal</b> <b>organs</b> for human nutrition with the purpose of teaching biological contents in elementary schools is allowed by the legislation. The number of regulations that limit teachers of biological content varies – depending if they buy and store the <b>animal</b> <b>organs</b> themselves or if they order it through the school kitchen and store it there until they use it. Acquiring an <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> represents a smaller financial burden; the costs depend on the organ’s type and source. The curricula of Natural Science 7 and Biology 8 offer many options for using accessible <b>animal</b> <b>organs.</b> The results of the online survey showed that teachers use the dissection of <b>animal</b> <b>organs</b> that are accessible at the butcher’s, however, in their opinion, they are not familiar enough with the legislation and the ways of using an <b>animal</b> <b>organ.</b> Still, most of the teachers believe that the quality of the knowledge acquired in dissecting an <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> is better. It can be concluded that the teachers would more often use <b>animal</b> <b>organs</b> for human consumption for dissection if they were more familiar with the possible ways of using <b>animal</b> <b>organs</b> in teaching according to the legal requirements, if they had accessible materials and possibilities for their incorporation into the curriculum. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{geometrical}} {{shapes of}} some <b>animal</b> <b>organs</b> have distinguished functions and properties {{that can provide}} useful information for bionic engineering applications. Hence, {{it is necessary to}} quantitatively measure the geometrical structure of those <b>animal</b> <b>organs.</b> However, some of the <b>animal</b> <b>organs</b> are tiny, complex and in the Meso-scale (0. 1 ~ 10 mm). Their potential bionic application requires an accurate and efficient method to quantitatively analysis of their geometrical shapes. But existing methods are difficult and inefficient to quantitatively analysis. Yet, it was found that MATLAB image processing and computer vision technique can be advantageously exploited to obtain outer margin geometrical information from stereomicroscopy photograph. In this work, based on MATLAB, a program was designed and a method was proposed that specified for extract meso-scale <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> outer margin contour points. The procedure for obtaining quantified geometrical information can be conclude as that stereomicroscope image of bionic object <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> was prepared, the image to reduce noise interference was processed, the outer edge contour points was detected, and the points x and y coordinates data to computer database was stored.

40|$|In Life Sciences {{education}} internationally, including South Africa, {{the study}} of <b>animal</b> and <b>organ</b> morphology has traditionally involved dissections since the early nineteenth century. The major {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate how the engagement of learners with <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> dissections may influence the development of problem-solving skills and how teachers use animal dissections to develop these skills of Grade 11 learners in Life Sciences (Biology) education. A mixed-methods research design was used for this study. Data were collected from a pre-test and a post-test (which had predominantly problem-solving questions), a learner questionnaire, lesson observations and teacher interviews. Tests and questionnaires were administered to 224 Grade 11 Life Sciences learners. Six Grade 11 Life Sciences teachers at four high schools from different environments participated in the study. The pre-test and post-test scores were compared using a parametric matched t-test. The comparison for the five cognitive levels including rote learning and problem-solving as well as the total calculation were all highly significant with p-values < 0. 0001. The learners’ responses in the questionnaire and the teachers’ responses during the interviews indicate their acknowledgement that <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> dissection may be used to develop problem-solving skills. The results show that there is more to <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> dissection than just cutting and drawing; it may be used as a problem-solving teaching strategy. The level of learner engagement with <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> dissections can determine the level of development of problem-solving skills. This study recommends that teachers should be encouraged to link <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> dissections to specific anatomical and physiological problems where applicable, and to allow learners to solve these problems when performing the dissections; they should not merely let the learners cut, draw and label the organ.

Only droplet of lipase solution {{was required for}} the depolymerizing activity on the film. By incubating the lipase droplet on the film, the depolymerizing activity can be readily analyzed as changes in the opacity of the thin film from transparent to opaque. We have further determined the factors that affect the lipase depolymerizing activity on the film. Factors such as pH, temperature and addition of metal ions and detergent on lipase depolymerizing activity were investigated. In addition, this method was used to detect the presence of lipase-like depolymerizing activity in <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> extracts. It is demonstrated {{for the first time}} that there are enzymes that can degrade P(3 HB-co- 4 HB) in <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> extracts and these enzymes are most probably lipases.|$|R
40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of using <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> dissection in general, and its use specifically in problem-solving as a teaching strategy in Grade 11 Life Sciences education. A multiple methods research design was used for this study. The data collection methods for the quantitative approach were the pre-test, post-test and a questionnaire. The pre-test and post-test had predominantly problem-solving questions. The questionnaire and the tests were administered to 224 learners from four Pretoria East secondary schools from different environments. The data collection methods for the qualitative approach were the interviews with the Grade 11 Life Sciences teachers of the selected schools, lesson observations and relevant document analysis. The interviews were conducted with six Grade 11 Life Sciences teachers teaching at the four selected schools. Findings from both the quantitative and the qualitative approaches were integrated to give an in-depth understanding of the study. The findings show that there were significant differences between the means of the pre-test and the post-test for the total for the whole group of 224 learners. The variables in which the tests were categorised were the rote learning, problem-solving and three learning outcomes of the National Curriculum Statement (NCS). The way in which the learners answered the questions in terms of terminology they used, the confidence they displayed, the level of answering and the explanations they gave when they wrote the post-test were significantly different from when they wrote the pre-test. The significant differences between the means of the pre-test and the post-test may possibly have been due to the intervention. This showed the effectiveness of the intervention which was <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> dissection in problem-solving. The study also showed that most teachers are not well-acquainted with problem-solving strategies which made it challenging for them to use <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> dissections to develop problem-solving skills in learners. The attitudes of the teachers and learners towards <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> dissection and its use in problem-solving as a teaching strategy were predominantly positive with less than a quarter of the whole group being negative due to a variety of reasons which include: moral values, religion, culture, blood phobia, squeamishness and being vegetarian. The majority of learners acknowledged the importance of <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> dissections in developing skills like investigative, dissecting and problem-solving skills. This acknowledgement resulted in them being positive towards the use of <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> dissections in problem-solving. One can conclude that <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> dissections can be used in problem-solving as a teaching strategy in Life Sciences education. The level of learner engagement with <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> dissections can determine the level of development of problem-solving skills as was evidenced by the differences between the mean scores of the four schools. The study recommended that the teachers should be encouraged to use <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> dissections more frequently where it is applicable to develop problem-solving skills in learners and not merely let the learners cut, draw and label the organ. Teachers should also focus on problem-solving in general and develop this as a prime strategy. All activities should be prepared by the teacher and implemented in class to encourage and develop problem-solving skills.

40|$|The {{morphological}} {{study has}} been one of the major approaches in medical and biological fields. For the last century, the con-ventional chemical fixation and alcohol dehydration were commonly used as an easy preparation method, but it was frequently pointed out that they usually yield many structural artifacts during their preparation processes. Although both conventional quick-freezing and high-pressure freezing methods, by which animal tissues are resected and frozen for physical fixation, can reduce such structural artifacts, the tissues have to be removed from living <b>animal</b> <b>organs</b> for the freezing. Therefore, such specimens are inevitably exposed to noxious stresses of anoxia and ischemia, exhibiting only dead morphological states of animal tissues without blood circulation. To the contrary, our “in vivo cryotechnique”, by which all cells and tissues in animal bodies are cryofixed in vivo, can prevent such artifacts of resected specimens. By means of the cryotechnique, it is now possible to reveal the in vivo morphology of cells and tissues in living <b>animal</b> <b>organs.</b> Actually, it has been already applied to several <b>animal</b> <b>organs,</b> such as kidney, liver, intestine, cerebellum, eye ball, blood vessel, and joint cartilage, and brought new morphological findings, reflecting their physiological significance, which had been difficult to demonstrate by the conventional preparation methods. Moreover, its application to immunohistochemistry has also revealed more precise immunolocalizations of dynamically changing molecules in living <b>animal</b> <b>organs,</b> easily translocated by ischemic stresses and anoxia caused during the tissue resection. The “in vivo cryotechnique ” allows us to perform novel morphological investigations of “living ” morphological states, and develops ne...|$|R

40|$|Background: Young people, and {{students}} in particular, generally have a positive attitude to xenotransplantation. We reported previously that university students attending their first year approved {{of the idea of}} transplanting <b>animal</b> <b>organs</b> into humans. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of a 3 -yr course at various faculties on the university students' understanding of and attitude to xenotransplantation. Methods: University students in their fourth year at five different faculties of Padua University (Italy), who had previously been surveyed in exactly the same way 3 yr earlier, were re-administered an anonymous 19 -item questionnaire on their attitude to xenotransplantation. Results: A total of 453 students completed the fourth year questionnaire (84 males, 369 females; mean age 24. 6 yr, range 21 - 36 yr). Students were attending courses in Medicine (22. 1 %), Veterinary Science (16. 5 %), Agriculture (10. 4 %), Educational Sciences (22. 1 %) and Psychology (28. 9 %). In their fourth year, 85 % of the students knew that <b>animal</b> <b>organs</b> could, at some stage, be transplanted into humans, 81. 5 % approved of this idea and 84 % would accept an <b>animal</b> <b>organ</b> to save their life if necessary (these percentages were 88 %, 78 % and 76 %, respectively 3 yr earlier). A significantly larger proportion of the students who approved of xenotransplantation were attending science courses rather than art courses, while no differences emerged as regards gender. Those who refused xenotransplantation justified their position mainly on ethical-moral (41. 7 %) and immunological (35. 7 %) grounds. Conclusions: As in their first year, so too in their fourth, University students were well informed about the feasibility of transplanting <b>animal</b> <b>organs</b> into human beings and those attending science courses were more likely to accept this idea than art students. Approval of xenotransplantation was much the same among fourth year males and females, whereas in the first year, male students had approved more than female students...|$|R
