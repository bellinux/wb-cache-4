5|$|One of Harrison's first acts as {{president}} was {{to implement a}} new training program for college graduates hired by the company.

5|$|Two {{enduring}} royal traditions {{emerged in}} Imerina {{as a consequence}} of the power struggle between Andriamasinavalona and his older brother. Some versions of oral history describe a combat between their armies at Ambohibato in which Andriamasinavalona emerged victorious. He erected a commemorative stone at the battle site that he named Ankazonorona, designating it the site where newly enthroned kings would stand to receive their first expression of hasina (homage, affirmation of authority) from their subjects. Andriamasinavalona also introduced the practice of gathering his <b>subjects</b> <b>to</b> consult them and obtain their consent before making certain decisions. This practice was continued by subsequent rulers in Imerina.|$|E
5|$|Another {{group of}} {{researchers}} has framed the cause {{in terms of}} social psychology, specifically the self-esteem theory. Beginning with Greenwald and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from implicit self-esteem, a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. Most people like themselves. The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters. As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin. It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce <b>subjects</b> <b>to</b> unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.|$|E

5|$|Casimir III of Poland urged Louis to {{intervene}} in his war with the Lithuanians who had occupied Brest, Volodymyr-Volynskyi, and other important towns in Halych and Lodomeria in the previous years. The two monarchs agreed that Halych and Lodomeria would {{be integrated into the}} Kingdom of Hungary after Casimir's death. Casimir also authorized Louis to redeem the two realms for 100,000 florins if Casimir fathered a son. Louis led his army to Cracow in June 1351. Because Casimir fell ill, Louis became the sole commander of the united Polish and Hungarian army. He invaded the lands of the Lithuanian prince, Kęstutis, in July. Kęstutis seemingly accepted Louis's suzerainty on 15 August and agreed to be baptised, along with his brothers, in Buda. However, Kęstutis did nothing to fulfill his promises after Polish and Hungarian troops were withdrawn. In an attempt to capture Kęstutis, Louis returned, but he could not defeat the Lithuanians, who even killed one of his allies, Boleslaus III of Płock, in battle. Louis returned to Buda before 13 September. A papal legate visited Louis to persuade him to wage war against Stefan Dušan, Emperor of the Serbs, who had forced his Roman Catholic <b>subjects</b> <b>to</b> be re-baptised and join the Serbian Orthodox Church.|$|E

5|$|During August and September 1326, Edward mobilised his defences {{along the}} coasts of England {{to protect against the}} {{possibility}} of an invasion either by France or by Roger Mortimer. Fleets were gathered at the ports of Portsmouth in the south and Orwell on the east coast, and a raiding force of 1,600 men was sent across the English Channel into Normandy as a diversionary attack. Edward issued a nationalistic appeal for his <b>subjects</b> <b>to</b> defend the kingdom, but with little impact. The regime's hold on power at the local level was fragile, the Despensers were widely disliked, and many of those Edward entrusted with the defence of the kingdom proved incompetent, or promptly turned against the regime. Some 2,000 men were ordered to gather at Orwell to repel any invasion, but only 55 appear to have actually arrived.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the impact of}} failure models {{on the performance of}} transfer lines composed of N machines separated by N - 1 buffers. The two most used failure models, operation-dependent failures (ODF) and time-dependent failures (TDF), are considered. A machine <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> TDF can fail even it is not working on a part. A machine <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> ODF cannot fail if it is not working on a part. A transfer line considered in this paper contains both machines <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> TDF and machines <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> ODF. Up times, repair times and processing times are continuous random variables of general distribution. We prove that modelling a machine <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> ODF of a transfer line as a machine <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> TDF, as usually done in the literature, leads to under-estimation of the throughput rate if the time between failures of the related machine is exponentially distributed while all other times are general random variables. We then propose a timed Petri net approach for performance evaluation and simulation of transfer lines with both machines <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> TDF and machines <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> ODF. Numerical results show that this result holds under more general conditions...|$|R
