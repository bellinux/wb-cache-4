5|$|Allison J. Waldman {{predicted}} that the commercial success of the soundtrack was due to Streisand's previous role and performance in the original film, Funny Girl. In the United States, the album debuted at number 75 on the Billboard 200 chart for the week ending March 29, 1975. It continued to climb the chart in that country for <b>several</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> peaking at number six on May 10. It spent four weeks within the top ten of chart, {{and a total of}} 25 weeks altogether. The Recording Industry Association of America certified the soundtrack Gold for shipments upwards of 500,000 sales on September 8, 1975. On Canada's Top Albums chart conducted and published by RPM, the record debuted at number 90 during the week of April 12, 1975.

5|$|There was a {{delay of}} <b>several</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> {{the report was}} {{distributed}} widely enough to gain the attention of governments. Mass transports of Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz began on 15 May 1944 {{at a rate of}} 12,000 people a day. Most went straight to the gas chambers. Vrba argued until {{the end of his life}} that the deportees would have refused to board the trains had the report been distributed wider and publicized sooner, a position generally not accepted by Holocaust historians.|$|E

5|$|His {{final years}} {{were marked by}} poor health. <b>Several</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> his death, McAleer was {{admitted}} to a local hospital, where his health reportedly improved. This account, however, {{differs from that of}} baseball historian David Fleitz, who suggested that McAleer had been diagnosed with cancer in the early 1930s. In any event, McAleer died suddenly on April 29, 1931, shortly after being released from the hospital. He was 66 years old. After private funeral services at Orr's funeral home, McAleer's remains were interred at Oak Hill Cemetery, on Youngstown's near south side. Apart from his widow, he left behind two brothers, J.C.

5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the hurricane, many {{residents}} in shanty towns failed to hear tropical cyclone warnings and watches. Some did hear the warnings, but they did not believe them as the same warning had been issued <b>several</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> and nothing had happened. In addition, city officials warned the residents living near the dam to take shelter in public buildings though most refused to leave. The government ignored all requests to shore up an earthen dam, as they did not believe Liza would pose a significant threat of damage to the Baja California Peninsula. Along the Gulf Coast, troops evacuated residents, and radio stations warned all nearby ships to remain at harbor. During the afternoon hours of September29, the education department suspended classes as it began to rain.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} US-based {{credit rating}} agencies—Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch—which {{have already been}} under fire during the housing bubble and the Icelandic crisis—have also played a central and controversial role in the current European bond market crisis. On one hand, the agencies {{have been accused of}} giving overly generous ratings due to conflicts of interest. On the other hand, ratings agencies have a tendency to act conservatively, and to take some time to adjust when a firm or country is in trouble. In the case of Greece, the market responded to the crisis before the downgrades, with Greek bonds trading at junk levels <b>several</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the ratings agencies began to describe them as such.|$|E
5|$|First-team coach Ronnie Moran {{took charge}} of team affairs for <b>several</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> Graeme Souness was named as Dalglish's successor. Under Souness, Liverpool won the FA Cup in 1992, but nothing else. He made way for Roy Evans, who also won just one trophy, the League Cup, before Gérard Houllier was {{appointed}} joint manager with Evans in 1998. This arrangement lasted only 18 games before Evans resigned, leaving Houllier—Liverpool's first non-British manager—in sole charge. Houllier won nothing until a treble in 2001, consisting of the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup. Houllier underwent major heart surgery during the 2001–02 season, but the squad was unaffected and managed {{to hold on to}} a second-place finish. Although Phil Thompson stepped in as temporary manager while Houllier was recovering from heart surgery, the matches played under Thompson are included in Houllier's record. Another League Cup was won in 2003, but this was to be Houllier's last trophy as Liverpool manager as he and the club parted by mutual consent {{at the end of the}} 2003–04 season, to be replaced by Valencia manager, Rafael Benítez.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Ivory {{became a}} fan favourite, and {{wrestled}} sporadically in the women's division. In June of that year, {{she had three}} pinfall victories over the WWE Women's Champion, Jazz, but never received a title match opportunity. Her only pay-per-view appearance {{in the course of}} the year was on December 14 at Armageddon, where she unsuccessfully challenged Molly Holly for the Women's Championship, after Molly grabbed her tights for leverage, and managed to capture the victory. She also served as a trainer on the third season of Tough Enough, and did broadcasting duties at WWE events. Ivory also spent eight weeks working as a trainer at WWE's then-developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). In May of that year, she and Todd Grisham began hosting The WWE Experience, a weekly television show that recapped events from Raw and SmackDown!. On July 22, 2005, <b>several</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> WWE Experience ended in August 2005, WWE announced that Ivory had opted not to renew her contract with the company.|$|E
5|$|Nursing lasts six {{to eight}} months in Californian populations and four to twelve months in Alaska, with the mother {{beginning}} to offer bits of prey at one to two months. The milk from a sea otter's two abdominal nipples is rich in fat and more similar to the milk of other marine mammals than {{to that of other}} mustelids. A pup, with guidance from its mother, practices swimming and diving for <b>several</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> it is able to reach the sea floor. Initially, the objects it retrieves are of little food value, such as brightly colored starfish and pebbles. Juveniles are typically independent at {{six to eight}} months, but a mother may be forced to abandon a pup if she cannot find enough food for it; at the other extreme, a pup may nurse until it is almost adult size. Pup mortality is high, particularly during an individual's first winter– by one estimate, only 25% of pups survive their first year. Pups born to experienced mothers have the highest survival rates.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} focuses of Dunderdale's premiership has been the {{development}} of {{the first phase of the}} Lower Churchill Project—Muskrat Falls. <b>Several</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> becoming premier, Dunderdale along with Williams and Premier Dexter of Nova Scotia, signed a partnership agreement to develop the multibillion-dollar hydro development. During her first official meeting with Prime Minister Stephen Harper on February 1, 2011, Dunderdale asked for his government's support with a loan guarantee for Muskrat Falls. The loan guarantee would reduce the cost of the project by millions, resulting in lower electricity rates for consumers. Dunderdale's first throne speech as premier was read out by Lieutenant Governor Crosbie on March 21, 2011, and there was significant focus placed on the Lower Churchill development. During a campaign stop in St. John's during the 2011 federal election Dunderdale endorsed Harper and his Conservative Party while Harper committed to the loan guarantee. On August 19, 2011, Canada's Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver announced a Memorandum of Agreement for the loan guarantee. While Oliver stated the loan guarantee would be in place by the end of November 2011, it was not until November 30, 2012 that the loan guarantee was finalized. In a simultaneous news conference held in St. John's and Halifax on December 17, 2012, Dunderdale and Emera Inc. announced they had both officially sanctioned the Muskrat Falls hydro development.|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} of shellfish, especially oysters, is another traditional activity which still {{takes place in}} Casamance, {{which is one of}} three oyster-producing regions in Senegal, along with Petite Côte and Sine-Saloum. Oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees which are uncovered at low tide. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. Oysters are {{an important component of the}} family diet. Rich in dietary minerals and vitamin C, they are the second largest source of animal protein among the Jola people after fish, followed by chicken, and pork. Oysters are readily associated with rice, the staple food, and in times of shortage, even replace it. Locally, oysters are boiled or grilled on a wood fire and consumed with a spicy sauce. Those destined for sale or preservation, however, are sun-dried or smoked. In some villages, including Carabane, they are kept alive for <b>several</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> being transported to market. Oysters are also a source of income, and Carabane is located in the center of the collection zone, which is one of the reasons why boats formerly called at the island. Oysters were once easily transported from Carabane to Dakar, where they were either sold by the pickers themselves or by hawkers.|$|E
