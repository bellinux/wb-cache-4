40|$|Background: In the era {{of highly}} {{effective}} direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, ribavirin (RBV) is still considered beneficial in certain patients. Aim: To assess the association between RBV steady-state plasma levels and sustained virological response (SVR). Methods: Consecutive HCV-infected patients treated with DAAs plus RBV from four Dutch academic medical centres were enrolled. RBV steady-state plasma levels were prospectively measured at treatment week 8 using validated assays. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the influence of RBV <b>steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> on SVR, and RBV therapeutic range was explored using area under the ROC curve analyses. Results: A total of 183 patients were included, of whom 85 % had one or more difficult-to-cure characteristics (ie treatment experienced, HCV genotype 3, cirrhosis). The majority was treated with a sofosbuvir-based regimen and 163 (89 %) patients achieved SVR. Median RBV dose was 12. 9 (interquartile range 11. 2 - 14. 7) mg/kg/d, and median RBV <b>steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> was 2. 66 (1. 95 - 3. 60) mg/L. In multivariable analyses, higher RBV <b>steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> (adjusted odds ratio 1. 79 [95 % CI 1. 09 - 2. 93]) was an independent predictor of SVR. With regard to the optimal RBV therapeutic range, 2. 28 mg/L was the optimal lower cut-off for achieving SVR and 3. 61 mg/L was the upper cut-off for preventing significant anaemia (Haemoglobin < 10 g/dL). Conclusion: In this cohort of mainly difficult-to-cure patients treated with DAAs plus RBV, higher RBV <b>steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> was an independent predictor of SV...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{monoclonal}} antibody to bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) and immunohistochemistry, we measured {{the incorporation of}} this thymidine analogue into the DNA of human normal and malignant cells exposed in vivo. BUdR given as a constant intravenous infusion for 12 or 24 h daily for up to 13 d resulted in a <b>steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> of 10 (- 6) M during the infusion. We demonstrated extensive incorporation of BUdR into both normal skin, normal bone marrow, and malignant melanoma cells. In addition, this infusion of BUdR was adequate to identify sister chromatid exchanges from human marrow chromosomes exposed in vivo. Using this constant infusion, significant but reversible (acute) toxicity was observed with myelosuppression and skin photosensitivity. These techniques, which are considerably less cumbersome and time-consuming than the use of radioactive isotopes of thymidine, {{can be used for}} further human studies of cell kinetics and chromosomal replication in both normal and malignant cells...|$|E

40|$|The current mode of {{administration}} of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in acute myocardial infarction is rather complex, although {{the rationale for the}} different components of this scheme is not clearly established. We compared pharmacokinetics of a continuous infusion of 38. 5 MU of Burroughs Wellcome t-PA (duteplase) over 90 minutes in nine patients (phase I) with a scheme including a 0. 04 MU/kg bolus, a 60 -minute 0. 36 MU/kg lytic infusion and a 180 -minute 0. 21 MU/kg maintenance infusion in 15 patients with acute myocardial infarction (Phase II). t-PA activity and antigen were fitted in a one-compartment model from which model-dependent and model-independent parameters were derived. Clearance of t-PA activity was 1020 +/- 465 (mean +/- SD) ml/min in phase I and 1359 +/- 590 ml/min in phase II. Clearance of t-PA antigen was 666 +/- 230 ml/min in phase I and 704 +/- 199 ml/min in phase II. Clearance of activity was significantly (p less than 0. 01) higher than of antigen. Clearance and steady-state plasma levels showed a large interindividual variability (coefficient of variation, 56. 4 %), but this was significantly reduced by dosing by weight (coefficient of variation, 28. 9 %; p = 0. 031). A 10 % bolus in phase II shortened the time to reach 75 % and 90 % of the <b>steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> by 4 and 5 minutes, respectively, not significantly different from phase I.

40|$|A bio-immunoassay (BIA) for the {{determination}} of staphylokinase (STA) activity in a plasma milieu has been developed. MA- 7 H 11, a murine monoclonal antibody raised against STA, which has a high affinity for STA but does {{not interfere with the}} complex formation between plasmin(ogen) and STA or with plasminogen activation by STA, was coated on microtiter plates at a concentration of 4 micrograms/ml. STA-containing samples were incubated overnight at 4 degrees C and, after extensive washing, bound STA was quantitated by incubation with plasminogen (final concentration 0. 5 microM) for 1 h at 37 degrees C, followed by determination of generated plasmin from the absorbance at 405 nm 10 min after addition of the chromogenic substrate S- 2403 (final concentration 0. 3 mM). Calibration curves constructed with natural (STAN) or recombinant (STAR) STA were linear between approximately 1 and 10 nM, with a lower detection limit of < or = 1 nM in buffer and in plasma of the human, baboon or hamster. Following bolus injection of STAR in hamsters, the disposition rate of STAR activity from plasma, determined with the BIA correlated very well (r = 0. 98) with that of STAR-related antigen determined by ELISA, indicating that STAR is cleared in a functionally active form. The initial half-life was about 2 min, as determined with both methods. Following continuous intravenous infusion over 1 h in baboons, the plasma clearance of STAR activity, determined from the infusion rate and the <b>steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> of STAR activity, ranged between 45 and 62 ml/min for doses of STAR between 0. 063 and 0. 250 mg/kg. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} ridogrel, a dual {{thromboxane}} A 2 (TXA 2) synthase inhibitor and TXA 2 /prostaglandin (PG) endoperoxide receptor antagonist, on systemic and renal production of prostaglandins and on platelet TXA 2 /PG endoperoxide receptors was evaluated upon chronic administration (300 mg b. i. d. orally, for 8 and 29 days) to man. Such a medication with ridogrel inhibits the systemic {{as well as}} the renal production of TXA 2 as measured by the urinary excretion of 2, 3 -dinor-TXB 2 and TXB 2 respectively without inducing significant changes in systemic or renal PGI 2 production. Simultaneously with the latter effects, the production of TXB 2 by spontaneously coagulated whole blood ex vivo is inhibited (> 99 %) while that of PGE 2 and PGF 2 -alpha is largely increased. Administration of ridogrel causes a three- to five-fold shift to the right of concentration-response curves for U 46619 in eliciting platelet aggregation; no tachyphylaxis is observed after 29 days of treatment in this respect. Apart from a reduction of serum uric acid levels with a concomitant increase in urinary uric acid excretion during the first days of treatment, no clinically significant changes in hematological, biochemical, hemodynamic and coagulation parameters occur during the 8 days or 29 days study. The study demonstrates that ridogrel is a potent inhibitor of the systemic as well as renal TXA 2 synthase and an antagonist of platelet TXA 2 /PG endoperoxide receptor in man, covering full activity during 24 h at <b>steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> conditions without tachyphylaxis during 29 days of medication.

40|$|Background Tamoxifen, {{the most}} {{frequently}} used drug for treating estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, must be converted into active metabolites to exert its therapeutic efficacy, mainly through CYP 2 D 6 enzymes.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between primidone and phenytoin was studied in an epileptic patient treated with primidone only and primidone plus phenytoin for 3 months. <b>Plasma</b> and urine <b>levels</b> {{of drugs and}} metabolites were monitored daily by GC and GC-MS. The addition of phenytoin to the regimen increased <b>steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> of phenobarbitone and phenylethylmalonamide (PEMA), metabolites of primidone, and decreased levels of primidone and unconjugated p-hydroxyphenobarbitone (p-OHPB), a metabolite of phenobarbitone. After withdrawal of phenytoin, plasma phenobarbitone and primidone levels slowly returned to previous steady-state levels, PEMA rapidly decreased to lower levels than before, and p-OHPB levels rose rapidly. Urinary excretion of primidone and its metabolites paralleled the changes in their <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> after the addition of phenytoin but the percentage of unconjugated p-OHPB in urine was unchanged {{during the course of}} the study. In conclusion phenytoin initially induces the conversion of primidone to PEMA and phenobarbitone, although each to a different extent, but it appears to inhibit the hydroxylation of phenobarbitone. Thus, two apparently contradictory phenomena seem to be involved in the primidone-phenytoin interaction. The net effect is an enhanced increase in <b>plasma</b> phenobarbitone <b>levels...</b>|$|R
40|$|In chapter 2 and 3 {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) NS 3 {{amino acids}} 1 - 181 were sequenced by the Sanger method and analyzed for resistance associated substitutions (RASs). RASs and their distribution between HCV genotype 1 a clade I and II viruses were compared between HIV-infected versus HIV-uninfected patients. We found that prevalence of clade I viruses and Q 80 K {{was significantly higher}} in HCV genotype 1 a infected patients with HIV coinfection than in those without HIV coinfection. We found that Q 80 K is a highly stable and transmissible RAS and was present in {{a large part of}} Dutch HIV-coinfected men-who-have-sex-with men. The introduction and expansion of Q 80 K variants in this key population suggests a founder effect. Prevalence of N 174 and S 122 RASs was significantly higher in clade II than clade I viruses. In chapter 4 and 5 data were compared between HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfected patients in the Dutch HIV Monitoring database and HBV mono-infected patients from two medical centers. We found that HIV/HBV coinfected patients no longer seem to be at increased risk for progression to end-stage liver disease (portal hypertension, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, and liver-related mortality) compared to HBV mono-infected patients, likely due to widespread use of highly effective cART with dual HBV and HIV activity. Moreover, we found that HIV/HBV coinfected patients have a similar incidence of HBsAg seroconversion, but a decreased incidence of HBeAg seroconversion compared to their HBV mono-infected counterparts. Lastly, HBV mono-infected patients had a higher prevalence of advanced fibrosis at their first presentation compared to their HIV coinfected counterparts. In chapter 6 a systematic review was conducted to give an overview of studies exploring adherence to combination treatment (PEG-interferon plus ribavirin) for HCV and nucleos(t) ide analogues for HBV. We found that non-adherence to treatment in chronic viral hepatitis is not a frequent phenomenon. In chapter 7 we investigated the effect of real-time medication monitoring on adherence to ribavirin in a randomized controlled trial during 24 weeks PEG-interferon/ribavirinÂ±boceprevir or telaprevir. We found that adherence to ribavirin is high and that real-time medication monitoring did not influence this. In chapter 8 we assessed the association between ribavirin steady-state plasma levels and sustained virological response (SVR) in HCV infected patients treated with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) plus RBV. 85 % of these patients had one or more difficult-to-cure characteristics (i. e. treatment-experienced, HCV genotype 3, cirrhosis). We found that higher RBV <b>steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>level</b> was an independent predictor of SVR. In chapter 9 we provided 100 hepatitis B patients with a medication dispenser that monitored entecavir intake during 16 weeks therapy in a prospective study. We found that 70 % of chronic hepatitis B patients exhibited good adherence to entecavir. Lastly, in chapter 10, data from all HBV-infected patients in a Dutch center were reviewed for outpatient loss to follow up. A total of 47 % had ever been lost to follow-up. Main reasons for outpatient compliance and loss to follow-up were doctorâ€™s advice and physicians presuming inactive disease respectively. In a questionnaire, the patients also affirmed to have relatively little insight into what the disease entailed. Thus, properly educating patients might increase understanding of the disease, help increase compliance, and improve treatment outcomes...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of oxcarbazepine (a new anticonvulsant {{which is}} a congener of carbamazepine) and of its 10 -hydroxy metabolite were studied {{at the outset of}} therapy in 8 adult epileptics comedicated with other anticonvulsants. The pharmacokinetic study was repeated under steady-state conditions after 3 months of drug intake in 6 of these subjects. The plasma elimination half-life of oxcarbazepine appeared to lie in the range 1. 0 - 2. 5 h, and that of its 10 -hydroxy metabolite averaged 8. 4 h. The apparent oral clearance of the parent drug (averaging 2. 51 Â·kg- 1 Â·h- 1) was high enough to suggest substantial presystemic elimination.

40|$|We {{have used}} a {{continuous}} intravenous infusion of glucose (6 mg/kg/min), insulin (80 mU/min), epinephrine (6 mug/min), and propranolol (0. 08 mg/min) to directly assess insulin resistance in 14 untreated adult onset diabetics with a mean (plus or minus SE) fasting <b>plasma</b> glucose <b>level</b> of 217 plus or minus 17 mg/ 100 ml. During the infusion endogenous insulin secretion is inhibited and <b>steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> glucose and insulin levels are achieved after 90 min. Since similar <b>steady-state</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>plasma</b> insulin are achieved in all subjects, the plasma glucose concentration observed during the steady-state period {{is a measure of}} an individual's insulin resistance. Under these conditions, the mean (plus or minus SE) <b>steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> glucose <b>level</b> of the 14 diabetic patients was 350 plus or minus 16 mg/ 100 ml, while that of 12 normal subjects was 121 plus or minus 4 mg/ 100 ml. Additional studies were performed in which control subjects and patients with diabetes had their fasting <b>plasma</b> glucose <b>levels</b> acutely raised or lowered to comparable levels before receiving the basic infusion mixture of glucose, insulin, epinephrine, and propranolol. The results of these studies indicated that differences in initial <b>plasma</b> glucose <b>levels</b> could not account for the different glucose responses of the two groups to the basic infusion. Finally, the mean (plus or minus SE) <b>steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> glucose <b>level</b> of 104 plus or minus 17 mg/ 100 ml observed during the same basic infusion in five patients with fasting hyperglycemia (mean plus or minus SE, 142 plus or minus 12 mg/ 100 ml) secondary to chronic pancreatitis suggested that neither chronic hyperglycemia nor hypoinsulinemia per se necessarily lead to insulin resistance. These results demonstrate that marked insulin resistance exists in adult onset diabetics with fasting hyperglycemia. Since previous studies have documented the presence of insulin resistance in patients with chemical diabetes, the possibility exists that insulin resistance may be characteristic of adult onset diabetes mellitus...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of peptides {{which have the}} natriuretic and vasodilator properties of the atrial natriuretic factor {{has made it possible}} to study the physiological role of this recently discovered hormonal system. In addition to renal effects, atrial natriuretic peptides exert vascular, hemodynamic and endocrine actions which may participate in the regulation of plasma and interstitial volume as well as arterial blood pressure. Its acute hypotensive effect, which was observed in normal volunteers and in patients with cardiac failure or hypertension, is not entirely explained by its direct vasodilator effect. The complexity of its role is demonstrated by its inhibiting action on the synthesis and/or the activity of other vasoactive hormones. The observed increase in hematocrit suggests that vascular permeability may be enhanced; the resulting consequences, e. g. on blood viscosity, still need to be elucidated. When infusing atrial natriuretic peptides, there exists a clear delay between the moment <b>steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> are achieved and peak effect occurs. This renders the interpretation of the results very difficult.

A total of eight atopic men with well-controlled asthma were studied, mean (SD) FEV 1 3. 50 (0. 73) L, equivalent to 87 (11) % of predicted; bronchial reactivity as measured by histamine PC 20 was 0. 77 mg/ml (geometric mean). On four separate study days infusions of 1, 3, or 10 pmol/kg/min of ANF or placebo were administered in a double-blind, randomized manner.

From the rates of infusion and the <b>steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> attained, the whole animal clearance rates for cholesterol carried in low density and high density lipoproteins and in chylomicrons were calculated to be 0. 53, 0. 61, and 42. 6 ml/hr, respectively. Hepatic cholesterol ester content increased by 0. 8 Î¼g/g for each 1. 0 mg/dl increase in the <b>steady-state</b> <b>level</b> of <b>plasma</b> low density lipoprotein cholesterol and by 1. 4 Î¼g/g for a similar elevation in plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol. In contrast, the increase in ester content was 300 -fold greater when chylomicrons were infused (330 Î¼g/g). The rate of hepatic cholesterol synthesis was inhibited by a factor of 0. 004 and 0. 007, respectively, per 1. 0 mg/dl increase in the <b>steady-state</b> <b>level</b> of <b>plasma</b> cholesterol carried in either low density or high density lipoprotein but the inhibition was by a factor of 0. 255, 50 -fold greater, when chylomicrons were infused. Thus, in the steady state, cholesterol carried in either low density or high density lipoproteins is apparently taken up by the liver and regulates the rate of hepatic cholesterol synthesis; however, cholesterol carried in chylomicrons is at least 50 -fold more effective in this regard. This marked difference {{can be attributed to the}} much higher rates of transport of chylomicron cholesterol into the hepatocyte than of cholesterol carried in either low density or high density plasma lipoproteins...|$|R

A pilot study of the pump implanted in 2 dogs showed continuous steady-state release of the protease inhibitor darunavir (25 mg/dog/day administered for 25 days), thereby achieving <b>plasma</b> concentration <b>levels</b> of approximately 40 ng/mL. <b>Steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> were reproducible after monthly refill of the pumps. In conclusion, the implantable adapted Codman 3000 constant-flow infusion pump customized to anti-HIV therapy allows sustained release of anti-HIV medication and may represent an opportunity to reduce the pill burden and complexity of dosing schemes associated with common anti-HIV therapy. status: publishe...|$|R

Extraction of arterially delivered angiotensin II ranged from 30 - 50 % in the limbs to 80 - 100 % in the renal and hepatomesenteric vascular beds both in essential hypertension (n= 13) and in unilateral renal artery stenosis (n= 7). Across the limbs, 20 - 30 % of arterially delivered angiotensin I was converted to angiotensin II in both groups, {{and there was no}} arteriovenous gradient in endogenous angiotensin II. No conversion of arterially delivered angiotensin I was detected across the renal and hepatomesenteric beds, and there was net extraction of angiotensin II from the systemic circulation by these beds. Although regional production of angiotensin I at tissue sites made a significant contribution to its level in the veins, little of this locally produced angiotensin I reached the regional veins in the form of angiotensin II, even in the kidney with artery stenosis, where the venous levels of locally produced angiotensin I were particularly high. These results provide no evidence for a source of circulating angiotensin II other than blood-borne angiotensin I and illustrate the high degree of compartmentalization of angiotensin I and II production.

During an overall treatment period of 1, 049 months, 1, 012 plasma samples were investigated. Pyrimethamine concentrations could be evaluated in 904 plasma samples. The weekly dosage of pyrimethamine ranged from 25 to 1, 400 mg; one patient with severe diarrhea received 2, 100 mg/week. <b>Steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> pyrimethamine concentrations were achieved after 12 to 20 days.

40|$|Ethylene {{glycol monomethyl ether}} (EGME) and {{ethylene}} glycol monoethyl ether (EGEE) were administered orally to young male rats at doses varying from 50 to 500 mg/kg/day and 250 to 1000 mg/kg/day for EGME and EGEE, respectively, for 11 days. At sequential times animals were killed and testicular histology examined. The initial and major site of damage following EGME treatment was restricted to the primary spermatocytes undergoing postzygotene meiotic maturation and division. EGEE produced damage of an identical nature, but a larger dose was required to elicit equivalent severity (500 mg EGEE/kg being approximately equivalent to 100 mg EGME/kg). Additionally, within the spermatocyte population, differential sensitivity was observed depending on the precise stage of meiotic maturation: dividing (stage XIV) and early pachytene (stages I-II) > late pachytene (stages VIII-XIII) > mid-pachytene (stages III-VII). Equivalent doses of methoxyacetic acid (MAA) and ethoxyacetic acid (EAA) gave injury similar to the corresponding glycol ether. When animals were pretreated with inhibitors of alcohol metabolism followed by a testicular toxic dose of EGME (500 mg/kg), an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase (pyrazole) offered complete protection. Pretreatment with the aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitors disulfiram or pargyline did not ameliorate the testicular toxicity of EGME. In mixed cultures of Sertoli-germ cells, MAA and not EGME produced effects on spermatocytes analogous to that seen in vivo, at concentrations approximately equivalent to <b>steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> after a single oral dose of EGME (500 mg/kg).

Reduced lipid (dietary fat and cholesterol) absorption induced by long-term PEG treatment could negatively affect growth in children. We tested whether PEG accelerates gastrointestinal transit and alters lipid absorption and <b>plasma</b> lipid <b>levels.</b> Methods: Wistar rats were administered drinking water with or without PEG (7 %) for 2 weeks. We studied whole gut transit time by recording the first appearance of red feces after intragastric carmine red administration. We measured plasma concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides, dietary fat absorption by 48 -hour fat balance and by plasma appearance of intragastrically administered stable-isotope labeled fats, and cholesterol absorption with a dual stable isotope technique. Results: PEG decreased whole gut transit time by 20 % (P = 0. 028) without causing diarrhea. PEG treatment did neither affects overall dietary fat balance nor fat uptake kinetics, cholesterol absorption, or plasma lipid concentrations.

40|$|These {{studies were}} {{designed}} to elucidate how shorter (MCI) and longer (HCO) chain-length saturated triacylglycerols and cholesterol interact to alter <b>steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> LDL-choles-terol <b>levels.</b> When either MCT or HCO was fed {{in the absence of}} cholesterol, there was little effect on receptor-dependent LDL transport but a 3643 % increase in LDL-cholesterol pro-duction. Cholesterol feeding in the absence of triacylglycerol led to significant suppression of receptor-dependent LDL transport and a 26 - 31 % increase in LDL-cholesterol produc-tion. However, when the longer chain-length saturated triacyl-glycerol was fed together with cholesterol there was a marked increase in the suppression of receptor-dependent LDL trans-port and an 82 % increase in production rate. Together, these two alterations accounted for the observed eightfold increase in plasma LDL-cholesterol concentration. In contrast, feeding the shorter chain-length saturated triacylglycerol with choles-terol actually enhanced receptor-dependent LDL transport while also causing a smaller increase (52 %) in the LDL-cho-lesterol production rate. As a result of these two opposing events, MCI ` feeding had essentially no net effect on <b>plasma</b> LDL-cholesterol <b>levels</b> beyond that induced by cholesterol feeding alone...|$|R

40|$|Cardiovascular {{mortality}} in dialysis patients remains a serious problem. It is 10 to 20 {{times higher than}} in the general population. No molecular mechanism has been proven to explain this increased mortality, although nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated. The objective of our {{study was to determine the}} extent of the removal of the NO congeners nitrite and nitrate from plasma and saliva by hemodialysis, as this might disrupt physiological NO bioactivity and help explain the health disparity in dialysis patients. Blood and saliva were collected at baseline from patients on dialysis and blood was collected as it exited the dialysis unit. Blood and saliva were again collected after 4 - 5 h of dialysis. In the 27 patients on dialysis, baseline plasma nitrite and nitrate by HPLC were 0. 21 Â± 0. 03 and 67. 25 Â± 14. 68 Î¼M, respectively. Blood immediately upon exit from the dialysis unit had 57 % less nitrite (0. 09 Â± 0. 03 Î¼M; P= 0. 0008) and 84 % less nitrate (11. 04 Î¼M; P= 0. 0003). After 4 - 5 h of dialysis, new <b>steady-state</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>levels</b> of nitrite and nitrate were significantly lower than baseline, 0. 09 Â± 0. 01 Î¼M (P= 0. 0002) and 16. 72 Â± 2. 27 Î¼M (P= 0. 001), respectively.
