40|$|Electronic {{components}} are usually assembled on {{printed circuit boards}} cooled by forced airflow. When the spacing between the boards is small, {{there is no room}} to employ a heat sink on critical components. Under these conditions, the components? thermal control may depend on the conductive path from the heater to the board in addition to the direct convective heat transfer to the airflow. The conjugate forced convection-conduction heat transfer from a two-dimensional <b>strip</b> <b>heater</b> flush mounted to a finite thickness wall of a parallel plates channel cooled by a laminar airflow was investigated numerically. A uniform heat flux was generated along the <b>strip</b> <b>heater</b> surface. Under steady state conditions, a fraction of the heat generation was transferred by direct convection to the airflow in the channel and the remaining fraction was transferred by conduction to the channel wall. The lower surface of the channel wall was adiabatic, so that the heat conducted from the heater to the plate eventually returned to the airflow. A portion of it returned upstream of the heater, preheating the airflow before it reached the heater surface. Due to this, it was convenient to treat the direct convection from the heater surface to the airflow by the adiabatic heat transfer coefficient. The flow was developed from the channel entrance, with constant properties. The conjugate problem was solved numerically within a single solution domain comprising both the airflow region and the solid wall of the channel. The results were obtained for the channel flow Reynolds number ranging from about 600 to 1900, corresponding to average airflow velocities from 0. 5 m/s to 1. 5 m/s. The effects of the solid wall to air thermal conductivities ratio were investigated in the range from 10 to 80, typical of circuit board materials. The wall thickness influence was verified from 1 mm to 5 mm.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the National Launch System (NLS) program was to design an operationally efficient, highly {{reliable}} vehicle with minimal recurring launch costs. To achieve this goal, trade studies of key main propulsion subsystems were performed to specify vehicle design requirements. These requirements {{include the use of}} passive recirculation to thermally condition the liquid hydrogen (LH 2) and liquid oxygen (LO 2) propellant feed systems and Space Transportation Main Engine (STME) fuel pumps. Rockwell International (RI) proposed a joint independent research and development (JIRAD) program with Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to study the LH 2 feed system passive recirculation concept. The testing was started in July 1992 and completed in November 1992. Vertical and sloped feedline designs were used. An engine simulator was attached {{at the bottom of the}} feedline. This simulator had <b>strip</b> <b>heaters</b> that were set to equal the corresponding heat input from different engines. A computer program is currently being used to analyze the passive recirculation concept in the LH 2 vertical feedline tests. Four tests, where the heater setting is the independent variable, were chosen. While the JIRAD with RI was underway, General Dynamics Space Systems (GDSS) proposed a JIRAD with MSFC to explore passive recirculation in the LO 2 feed system. Liquid nitrogen (LN 2) is being used instead of LO 2 for safety and economic concerns. To date, three sets of calibration tests have been completed on the sloped LN 2 test article. The environmental heat was calculated from the calibration tests in which the <b>strip</b> <b>heaters</b> were turned off. During the LH 2 testing, the environmental heat was assumed to be constant. Therefore, the total heat was equal to the environmental heat flux plus the heater input. However, the first two sets of LN 2 calibration tests have shown that the environmental heat flux varies with heater input. A Systems Improved Numerical Differencing Analyzer and Fluid Integrator (SINDA/FLUINT) model is currently being built to determine if this variation in environmental heat is due to a change in the wall temperature. During the third set of calibration tests, a faulty reference junction was found. Based on this anomaly with the reference junction, the heat flux calculations from the first two calibration sets are now considered questionable...|$|R
