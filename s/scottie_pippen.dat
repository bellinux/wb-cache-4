5|$|January 3, 1989, Michael Jordan (Chicago Bulls) had 41 points, 11 assists, and 10 {{rebounds and}} <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> had 15 points, 12 assists, and 10 rebounds against the Los Angeles Clippers.|$|E
5|$|The 1997–98 {{season was}} marked by injuries, and the team {{finished}} 41–41 with the eighth seed in the Western Conference. Houston once again faced the Jazz, {{this time in the}} first round, and they lost the series 3–2. Drexler retired after the season, and the Rockets made another bold trade to bring in <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> to take his place. In the strike-shortened 1998–99 season, the Rocket went 31–19, but lost to the Lakers in the first round 3–1 of the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|After the Bulls {{won their}} sixth championship, Phil Jackson {{decided to leave}} the team and spend some time away from basketball. Michael Jordan then {{announced}} his second retirement, which prompted general manager Jerry Krause to begin rebuilding the roster with younger athletes. Six players from the 1997–98 Bulls (<b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen,</b> Dennis Rodman, Steve Kerr, Luc Longley, Jud Buechler, and Scott Burrell) joined other teams through free agency or sign-and-trade deals, and with few established players left on the roster, the Bulls missed the 1999 playoffs. This began a six-year playoff drought, the longest such drought in team history.|$|E
5|$|Drexler {{retired after}} the season, and the Rockets traded {{to bring in}} <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> to take his place. In the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Rockets lost to the Lakers {{in the first round}} of the playoffs. After the 1999 draft, the Rockets traded for the second overall pick Steve Francis from the Vancouver Grizzlies, in {{exchange}} for four players and a first-round draft pick. However, after Houston traded a discontented Pippen to Portland, and Barkley suffered a career-ending injury, the rebuilt Rockets went 34–48 and missed the playoffs, for only the second time in 15 years.|$|E
5|$|Sloan played ten {{seasons with}} the Bulls and became the Bulls' {{franchise}} leader in games played when he retired in 1976, a record which has since been broken by Michael Jordan and <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen.</b> He then coached the Bulls from 1979 to 1982, and in 1988, embarked upon a coaching career with the Utah Jazz that lasted 23 years. Sloan has since been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach, as has fellow draftee John Thompson. The latter never worked for the Bulls in any capacity, but found success as a coach at Georgetown University.|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{entered the}} 1989–90 {{season as a}} team on the rise, with their core group of Jordan and young {{improving}} players like <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> and Horace Grant, and {{under the guidance of}} new coach Phil Jackson. Jordan averaged a league leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg in leading the Bulls to a 55–27 record. They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals after beating the Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers. However, despite pushing the series to seven games, the Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season.|$|E
5|$|After the 1997–1998 NBA season, the Bulls {{started a}} massive {{rebuilding}} phase, largely {{at the behest}} of then-general manager Jerry Krause. Head coach Phil Jackson and several members of the team left via free agency or retirement, including Michael Jordan, <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen,</b> Steve Kerr, and Jud Buechler. Rodman was released by the Bulls on January 21, 1999, {{before the start of the}} lockout-shortened 1998–99 NBA season. With his sister acting as his agent at the time, Rodman joined the Los Angeles Lakers, for a pro-rated salary for the remainder of the 1998–1999 season. With the Lakers he only played in 23games and was released.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990–91 season, Jordan won {{his second}} MVP award after {{averaging}} 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg {{for the regular}} season. The Bulls finished in first place in their division {{for the first time}} in 16 years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season. With <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> developing into an All-Star, the Bulls had elevated their play. The Bulls defeated the New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs. They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the Detroit Pistons, awaited them. However, this time the Bulls beat the Pistons in a four-game sweep.|$|E
5|$|With Phil Jackson's {{contract}} expiring, {{the pending}} departures of <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> and Dennis Rodman looming, {{and being in}} the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NBA players, Jordan retired {{for the second time}} on January 13, 1999. On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player, but as part owner and President of Basketball Operations for the Washington Wizards. Jordan's responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive. He controlled all aspects of the Wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters. Opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed. He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (such as forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland), but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high schooler Kwame Brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{games into}} the 2010–11 season, Duncan became the Spurs' all-time leader in points scored and games played. Along the way, the Spurs {{compiled}} a 12-game winning streak to go 13–2 after 15 games. On November 30, 2010, Duncan recorded his third career triple-double against the Golden State Warriors. 12 days later, {{in a game}} against the Portland Trail Blazers, Duncan became the 94th player in NBA history to play 1,000 games. Through his 1,000th game, the Spurs have been 707–293; only <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> (715–285) had a better record with his team through his first 1,000 games. The Spurs were 29–4 after 33 games—one of the ten best starts in NBA history–and led the league at 35–6 halfway through the season. Although Duncan produced career-lows in points and rebounds per game, the Spurs ended the regular season as the first seed in the West for the 2011 NBA Playoffs, and were second in the league (to Chicago). Despite finishing with a 61–21 record, however, the Spurs could not avoid being upset in the first round, 4–2, by the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies.|$|E
5|$|The Rockets' two-year {{championship}} run {{ended when}} they were eliminated {{in the second round}} of the 1996 NBA Playoffs by the eventual Western Conference Champion Seattle SuperSonics. Michael Jordan had returned from an 18-month hiatus in March 1995, and his Chicago Bulls dominated the league for the next three years (1996–98). The Bulls and Rockets never met in the NBA Playoffs. The Rockets posted a 57–win season in 1996–97 season when they added Charles Barkley to their roster. They started the season 21–2, but lost the Western Conference Finals in six games to the Utah Jazz. After averaging 26.9 and 23.2 points in 1995–96 and 1996–97 respectively, Olajuwon's point production dipped to 16.4 in 1997–98. After the Rockets lost in the first round in five games to the Jazz in 1998, Drexler retired. In 1998–99 the Rockets acquired veteran All-Star <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> and finished 31–19 in the lockout-shortened regular season. Olajuwon's scoring production rose to 18.9 points per game, and he made his twelfth and final All-NBA Team. However, they lost in the first round again, this time to the Lakers. After the season, Pippen was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to rebuild, the team {{acquired}} several players who were highly talented, but had reputations for off-court troubles. Isaiah Rider, who was traded by the Minnesota Timberwolves for a draft pick and career backups due to his frequent arrests and lack of punctuality, was arrested for cannabis possession two days before his debut with the Blazers. Rasheed Wallace, who was acknowledged as a hot-tempered player since college, was also acquired, in a trade with the Washington Bullets. Point guard Kenny Anderson was {{signed as a free}} agent, and subsequently traded to the Toronto Raptors for Damon Stoudamire in February 1998 (the Raptors traded Anderson to the Boston Celtics five days later, because {{he did not want to}} play in Canada). Initially, this approach worked, as the team returned to the Western Conference finals in 1999 under head coach Mike Dunleavy. After being swept by the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs, Whitsitt sent Rider and guard Jim Jackson to the Atlanta Hawks for guard Steve Smith and acquired former All-Star forward <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> from the Houston Rockets. The team again advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they faced a Los Angeles Lakers team led by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. In that series, the Trail Blazers dropped three out of the first four games before winning the next two, forcing a pivotal Game 7. The Blazers had a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter, but lost the game and the series to the Lakers, who went on to win the first of three consecutive titles.|$|E
25|$|Howard, {{along with}} Carmelo Anthony and <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen,</b> also {{appeared}} in the 2013 Chinese film Amazing, {{a joint venture between}} the NBA and Shanghai Film Group Corporation.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong {{finished}} third in scoring again in 1995 as the Bulls posted a 47–35 record, and with Jordan, <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> and Toni Kukoč, led the team to the second round again.|$|E
25|$|Charles Barkley {{was voted}} {{as a starter}} for the Western Conference in the All-Star Game. It was his seventh All-Star selection. Barkley {{finished}} third in All-Star voting with 858,947 votes, behind only Michael Jordan (1,035,824) and <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> (932,912).|$|E
25|$|The United States National Basketball Association has a {{substantial}} following in Taiwan. Popular basketball {{players such as}} Allen Iverson, Kevin Garnett, Chauncey Billups, Andre Iguodala, Jason Williams, Karl Malone, Michael Jordan, Grant Hill, Clyde Drexler, Glen Rice, Kobe Bryant, and <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> have visited Taiwan.|$|E
25|$|In the offseason, Michael Jordan and <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> {{played for}} the Dream Team at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, winning the gold medal. They entered the new season with little rest, {{but it did not}} stop both Jordan and Pippen from leading the Bulls to a 57–25 record, good for second in the Eastern Conference.|$|E
25|$|The Bulls {{saw their}} {{greatest}} success during the 1990s, {{when they were}} responsible for popularizing the NBA worldwide. They are known for {{having one of the}} NBA's greatest dynasties, winning six NBA championships between 1991 and 1998 with two three-peats. All six championship teams were led by Hall of Famers Michael Jordan, <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> and coach Phil Jackson. The Bulls are the only NBA franchise to win multiple championships and never lose an NBA Finals series in their history.|$|E
25|$|The Knicks have {{a strong}} rivalry with the Chicago Bulls. The rivalry's most intense period was during the late 1980s and early 90s, when both teams were huge playoff contenders. This {{intensity}} was due {{to a variety of}} factors: the great frequency in which the teams competed against each other in high-stakes contests and playoff series; well-known players such as Michael Jordan, <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen,</b> Patrick Ewing, and John Starks; the reputations of the team's respective cities; and personnel changes and conflicts between the teams.|$|E
25|$|On October 1, 2008, Gordon finally {{accepted}} a one-year qualifying offer of $6.4 million after {{being unable to}} secure the contract that he was hoping for. On December 27, 2008, Gordon passed <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> as the Chicago Bulls' career leader in three-pointers made. As had {{been the case in}} his previous four seasons, the Bulls' season got off to a rocky start. However Gordon and Rose developed chemistry playing with each other, and helped the Bulls finish the season on a 15–8 run to just qualify for the playoffs at 41–41.|$|E
25|$|On May 13, 1994, {{at the end}} of Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls and the New York Knicks {{were tied}} at 102 with 1.8 seconds left. Bulls coach Phil Jackson {{designed}} the last play for Kukoč, with <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> charged with inbounding the basketball. Pippen was so angered by Jackson's decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over. Kukoč did hit the game-winner, a 23-foot fadeaway jumper at the buzzer, though the Bulls eventually lost the series in seven games.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2003, long-time GM Jerry Krause retired, and former player and color {{commentator}} John Paxson was tapped as his successor. Jay Williams, coming off a promising rookie campaign, was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. His contract was bought out by the Bulls in February 2004 and {{he has yet to}} return to the game. Paxson selected point guard Kirk Hinrich with the seventh pick in the draft, and signed veteran free agent and former franchise player <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen.</b> With Pippen playing, Cartwright at the sidelines, and Paxson in the front office, the Bulls hoped that some of the championship magic from before would return.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} commemorate the 20th anniversary of their first NBA Championship in 1991, the Chicago Bulls {{organization}} honored the 1991 Chicago Bulls Championship team in a ceremony during halftime of a game versus the Utah Jazz on March 12, 2011. <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> and Michael Jordan both attended and participated in the celebration, where they were reunited with their former teammates John Paxson, Horace Grant, Stacey King, Craig Hodges, Will Perdue, Scott Williams, Cliff Levingston, Dennis Hopson and Assistant Coach Johnny Bach. Former head coach Phil Jackson did not participate but gave a speech via a video message. Former Bulls' broadcaster Jim Durham emceed the halftime ceremony.|$|E
25|$|They {{managed to}} put it all {{together}} that season, winning a then-franchise record 61 games. Jordan won the scoring title for a fifth consecutive season, but the team was no longer a one-man show of years past. Instead, Jordan distributed the ball with regularity, {{thanks in large part to}} the triangle offense instituted by head coach Phil Jackson and assistant Tex Winter. This gave the Bulls additional offensive weapons to choose from, ranging from wingman <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> and post players Horace Grant and Bill Cartwright to shooters such as John Paxson and B. J. Armstrong. Jordan's improved all-around play earned him his second MVP award.|$|E
25|$|In the 1995–96 season, the Magic again {{were near}} the top of the Eastern Conference and the Atlantic Division with a 60–22 record, led by O'Neal and Hardaway; however, the Magic were seeded number two, behind the NBA's all-time second best 72–10 record of the Chicago Bulls. In the meantime, General Manager Pat Williams was {{promoted}} to Senior Executive Vice President and replaced by the Vice President of Basketball Operations John Gabriel on April 29, 1996. In the playoffs, after the Magic defeated the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks, Orlando met the Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals. The combination of Jordan, <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> and rebounder Dennis Rodman was too much for the Magic, and Orlando was swept 4–0.|$|E
25|$|The 1997–98 {{season was}} one of turmoil for the NBA {{champion}} Bulls. Many speculated this would be Michael Jordan's final season with the team. Phil Jackson's future with the team was also questionable, as his relationship with team general manager Jerry Krause {{was one of}} growing tension. <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> {{was looking for a}} significant contract extension that he thought he deserved, but was not getting from the organization. In spite of the turmoil that surrounded the Bulls, they still had a remarkable season, with a final regular-season record of 62–20. Michael Jordan would be named the league MVP for the fifth and final time, and the Bulls went into the playoffs as the number one seed in the Eastern Conference.|$|E
25|$|Under rookie {{head coach}} Paul Westphal (a former Suns {{assistant}} and, as a player, {{member of the}} 1976 Suns squad {{that went to the}} NBA Finals), the Suns squad won 62 games, setting a franchise record (since tied in 2004–05). In {{the first round of the}} playoffs, they defeated the eighth-seeded Lakers, coming back from an 0–2 deficit in the five-game series. The Suns went on to eliminate the Spurs and SuperSonics, advancing to the Finals for the second time in franchise history. They eventually lost to the Chicago Bulls, led by eventual Hall of Famers Michael Jordan and <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen.</b> The series included a triple-overtime game (Game 3) that along with Game 5 of the 1976 series are the only triple-overtime games in the history of the NBA Finals. Approximately 300,000 fans braved the 105° heat to celebrate the memorable season in the streets of Phoenix.|$|E
25|$|On October 6, 1993, Michael Jordan {{shocked the}} {{basketball}} community by announcing his retirement, {{three months after}} his father's murder. The Bulls were then led by <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen,</b> who established himself {{as one of the}} top players in the league by winning the 1994 All-Star MVP. He received help from Horace Grant and B.J. Armstrong, who were named to their first all-star games. The three were assisted by Cartwright, Perdue, shooting guard Pete Myers, and Croatian rookie forward Toni Kukoč. Despite the Bulls winning 55 games during the 1993–94 season, they were beaten in seven games by the Knicks in the second round of the playoffs, after a controversial foul call by referee Hue Hollins in game 5 of that series. The Knicks eventually reached the finals that year, but lost to the Houston Rockets. The Bulls opened the 1994–95 season by leaving their home of 27 years, Chicago Stadium, and moving into their current home, the United Center.|$|E
25|$|Kidd {{was named}} a reserve for the NBA All-Star game along with {{teammate}} Vince Carter during the 2006–07 season. However, Kidd missed the game because of a strained back and was replaced on the roster by Joe Johnson. On April 7, 2007, Kidd and Carter became the first teammates to record triple-doubles in the same game since Michael Jordan and <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> did it in 1989 for the Chicago Bulls. In {{the first round of}} the 2006–07 postseason Kidd averaged 14.0 points, 13.2 assists, 10.0 rebounds, and 2.0 steals, as the Nets defeated the Toronto Raptors in six games. He joined Wilt Chamberlain and Magic Johnson as the only players in NBA history to average a triple-double in multiple playoff series. For the postseason, Kidd averaged 14.6 points, 10.9 assists and 10.9 rebounds in twelve playoff games. He became the second player in NBA history to average a triple-double for an entire postseason. Despite Kidd's efforts the Nets were eliminated in six games in the Eastern Conference Semifinals by the Cleveland Cavaliers.|$|E
25|$|In the 1986–87 NBA season, Jordan {{continued}} his {{assault on the}} record books, leading the league in scoring with 37.1 points per game and becoming the first Bull named to the All-NBA First Team. The Bulls finished 40–42, which {{was good enough to}} qualify them for the playoffs. However, they were again swept by the Celtics in the playoffs. In the 1987 draft, to address their lack of depth, Krause selected center Olden Polynice eighth overall and power forward Horace Grant 10th overall, then sent Polynice to Seattle in a draft-day trade for the fifth selection, small forward <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen.</b> With Paxson and Jordan in the backcourt, Brad Sellers and Oakley at the forward spots, Corzine anchoring center, and rookies Pippen and Grant coming off the bench, the Bulls won 50 games and advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals, where they were beaten by the eventual Eastern Conference Champions Detroit Pistons in five games. For his efforts, Jordan was named NBA Most Valuable Player, an award he would win four more times over his career. The 1987–88 season would also mark the start of the Pistons-Bulls rivalry which was formed from 1988 to 1991.|$|E
25|$|On October 28, 2015, Westbrook {{opened the}} Thunder's 2015–16 {{season with a}} game-high 33 points and 10 assists in a 112–106 win over the San Antonio Spurs. Two days later, in a double-overtime win over the Orlando Magic, Westbrook and Kevin Durant became the first pair of {{teammates}} to each score at least 40 points in a single game since Michael Jordan and <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> accomplished the feat in 1996. Westbrook had 48 and Durant had 43 as the Thunder defeated the Magic 139–136. On November 10, Westbrook recorded his first triple-double of the season (20th of career) with 22 points, 11 assists and 11 rebounds in a 125–101 win over the Washington Wizards. Three days later, he recorded his second straight triple-double, recording 21 points, a then career-high 17 rebounds and 11 assists in a 102–85 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. On December 27, in a win over the Denver Nuggets, Westbrook had 30 points, 12 assists, and nine rebounds, just missing {{what would have been}} his fourth triple-double of the season. In that game, Westbrook and Durant became the first teammates to each have at least 25 points and 10 assists in a regulation game since Utah's John Stockton (31 points, 11 assists) and Karl Malone (27 points, 10 assists) on February 2, 1996. On January 4, he was named NBA Western Conference co-Player of the Month for December alongside Durant.|$|E
25|$|The {{summer of}} 1998 brought {{an abrupt end}} to the {{championship}} era. Krause felt that the Bulls {{were on the verge}} of being too old and unable to compete. He decided that the team's only choices were to rebuild or endure a slow decline. His plan was to trade away the aging talent and acquire high draft picks while clearing salary cap space to make a run at several promising free agents in two years' time. After having been vetoed in a previous attempt by owner Jerry Reinsdorf, Krause traded <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> for Roy Rogers (who was released in February 1999) and a conditional second-round draft pick from the Houston Rockets. He also decided not to re-sign Dennis Rodman, and traded Luc Longley and Steve Kerr for other draft picks. He hired a new coach, Tim Floyd, who had run a successful program at Iowa State University. Upon Phil Jackson's departure, Michael Jordan made his second retirement official. With a new starting lineup of point guard Randy Brown, shooting guard Ron Harper, newcomer Brent Barry at small forward, power forward Toni Kukoč, and center Bill Wennington, the team began the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season. Kukoc led the team in scoring, rebounding, and assists, but the team won only 13 of 50 games. The lowest point of the season came on April 10 in a game against the Miami Heat. In that game, the Bulls scored 49 points to set an NBA record for the fewest points in a game in the shot clock era.|$|E
500|$|Tim Duncan {{holds the}} record for the most total {{selections}} to the All-Defensive Team with 15. Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant follow with twelve total honors each, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has eleven total selections. [...] Michael Jordan, Gary Payton, Garnett and Bryant share {{the record for}} most NBA All-Defensive first team selections with nine. <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen,</b> Bobby Jones, and Duncan made the first team eight times each. Walt Frazier, Dennis Rodman and Chris Paul made the All-Defensive first team seven times.|$|E
500|$|In a 1997 NBA Playoff {{game against}} the Chicago Bulls he got hot and scored 11 quick points {{in the third quarter}} to nearly help the Hawks {{comeback}} in the game to even the second-round playoff series at two games apiece. [...] At one point after a hot shooting streak, the Bulls assigned Michael Jordan to defend Recasner and the Bulls then stopped the comeback. [...] Recasner's defense also pressured Jordan into a travelling violation in the final minute of the game. [...] However, efforts by Michael Jordan and <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen</b> saved the day for the Bulls.|$|E
500|$|Eleven players (Charles Barkley, Clyde Drexler, Patrick Ewing, Michael Jordan, Karl Malone, Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, Robert Parish, <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen,</b> David Robinson and John Stockton) {{were active}} in the , during which the team was announced. [...] All have since retired. O'Neal {{was the last to}} be active in the NBA, {{retiring}} {{at the end of the}} [...] All of the selected players have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Lenny Wilkens was the only member of the players list to have been selected as a member of the coaches list. At the time of the list, only Pete Maravich was deceased. Since then, Wilt Chamberlain, Dave DeBusschere, Paul Arizin, George Mikan, Bill Sharman, Moses Malone, Dolph Schayes and Nate Thurmond have all died.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, {{following}} in the footsteps of Einhorn who had purchased a United States Football League franchise in 1984, he purchased the Chicago Bulls as part of a syndicate for US$16 million and quickly turned the team from one that averaged 6,365 fans per game at the 17,339-seat Chicago Stadium in 1985 into one with an 8,000-person season ticket waiting list. [...] He did so by drafting Horace Grant and <b>Scottie</b> <b>Pippen,</b> and trading for Bill Cartwright to join John Paxson and Michael Jordan under the tutelage of head coach Doug Collins. [...] In 1989, the team signed Phil Jackson as the final piece of the championship puzzle. [...] From November 20, 1987 through Jordan's 1999 retirement, the Bulls sold out every game.|$|E
