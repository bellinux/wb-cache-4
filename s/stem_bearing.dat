25|$|Two {{collections}} of plant material {{were made on}} July 13, 2000. The herbarium specimen Clarke, Davis & Tamin 1307 was designated as the holotype of N. jacquelineae. It consists of two sheets from two different plants: {{a portion of a}} climbing stem with an upper pitcher and a mature female inflorescence; and an immature rosette with lower pitchers and a male inflorescence. The isotype Clarke, Davis & Tamin 1307, collected {{at the same time as}} the holotype, consists of a single sheet with a fragment of a sterile climbing <b>stem</b> <b>bearing</b> two upper pitchers. Both specimens are deposited at the Herbarium of Andalas University (ANDA). A third specimen, Nepenthes Team NP 384, is also deposited at the herbarium.|$|E
60|$|I {{would not}} have this perfect love of ours Grow from a single root, a single <b>stem,</b> <b>Bearing</b> no goodly fruit, but only flowers That idly hide life's iron diadem: It should grow alway like that Eastern tree Whose limbs take root and spread forth constantly; That love for one, from which there doth not spring Wide love for all, is but a {{worthless}} thing. Not in another world, as poets prate, Dwell we apart above the tide of things, High floating o'er earth's clouds on faery wings; But our pure love doth ever elevate Into a holy bond of brotherhood All earthly things, making them pure and good.|$|E

50|$|It has a short <b>stem</b> <b>bearing</b> a tuft of long, narrow, arching leaves 10-35 cm {{long and}} 1-2 cm broad, and a central flower stalk 25-60 cm tall, ending in an umbel of 20-30 white, or bright blue, funnel-shaped flowers, each flower 2.5-5 cm diameter.|$|E
50|$|Species of Quaqua {{are usually}} characterised by having stout, firm, 4 or 5-sided <b>stems</b> <b>bearing</b> conical tubercles which {{often have a}} tough, {{tapering}} spike at their ends. A few species lack the spikes or have smoothly rounded tubercles.|$|R
50|$|It is a spherical cactus {{growing to}} 5 cm tall by 7 cm wide, with ribbed <b>stems</b> <b>bearing</b> brown spines and white, daisy-like flowers in summer. In cultivation, where {{temperatures}} fall below 10 C {{it requires the}} protection of glass.|$|R
50|$|Associated with <b>stems</b> <b>bearing</b> sporangia {{were other}} stems with {{branches}} at wide angles, some with short side branches. They {{are thought to}} represent a system of basal rhizomes, but direct connections to the aerial stems were not observed. The gametophyte is unknown.|$|R

50|$|In 2004, Crane et al. {{published}} a unified cladogram for the polysporangiophytes (plants with branched <b>stems</b> <b>bearing</b> sporangia), based on cladistic analyses of morphological features. This {{suggests that the}} zosterophylls were a paraphyletic stem group, related to the ancestors of modern lycophytes.|$|R
50|$|Nemacladus is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} bellflower family known generally as threadplants. There are 18 accepted species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These are annual herbs with very slender, sometimes threadlike, branching <b>stems</b> <b>bearing</b> small five-lobed flowers.|$|R
50|$|As the sporangia of Tortilicaulis are branched, {{cladistic}} {{analysis suggests}} that the genus may instead belong to the Horneophytopsida, a class of the polysporangiophytes, which unlike bryophytes, have branched <b>stems</b> <b>bearing</b> sporangia. Its precise nature and hence classification remains unclear. For the cladogram, see the Horneophytopsida article.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{perennial}} herb forming a small cushiony mat covered in oval leaves {{up to about}} centimeter long.

50|$|Melica is a genus of {{perennial}} grasses known generally as melic or melic grass. They {{are found}} in most temperate regions of the world. They are clumping grasses with long, erect <b>stems</b> <b>bearing</b> spikelets of papery grass flowers. Some species of melic have corms and are sometimes called oniongrass.|$|R
50|$|Naturally most cool {{temperate}} {{species are}} deciduous and dormant in winter {{in their native}} environment. But a few species which distribute in hot summer and mild winter area (Lilium candidum, Lilium catesbaei, Lilium longiflorum) lose leaves and remain relatively short dormant in Summer or Autumn, sprout from Autumn to winter, forming dwarf <b>stem</b> <b>bearing</b> a basal rosette of leaves until, after they have received sufficent chilling, the stem begins to elongate in warming weather.|$|E
50|$|They {{are rather}} small plants with a rosette of simple {{orbicular}} or ovate leaves, with a flower <b>stem</b> <b>bearing</b> generally rather lax racemes of simple white, cream or pink flowers. The immediate distinguishing feature of Pyrola species is the flower style {{which is often}} curved, sticks out beyond the petals and is expanded below the stigma which itself is branched into several lobes. To the casual observer the flower {{appears to have a}} small bell-clapper sticking out.|$|E
50|$|Eucomis bicolor, the {{variegated}} pineapple lily, is {{a species}} of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae, native to Southern Africa (the Cape Provinces, Lesotho, KwaZulu-Natal, the Free State, and the Northern Provinces). It is a bulbous perennial growing to 30 - 60 cm in height, with a basal rosette of wavy leaves 30 - 50 cm long. In late summer it produces a stout <b>stem</b> <b>bearing</b> racemes of pale green, purple margined flowers with a terminal rosette of pale green leafy bracts. At close quarters it has an unpleasant smell.|$|E
50|$|Petrophytum (orth. var. Petrophyton) {{is a small}} genus {{of plants}} in the rose family known as the rock spiraeas or rockmats. These are low mat-forming shrubs which send up erect <b>stems</b> <b>bearing</b> spike inflorescences of flowers. The brushy flowers are white and have many stamens and hairy, thready pistils. Rockmats are native to western North America.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stems</b> <b>bearing</b> {{deformed}} fruit {{may also}} thicken and grow with a deformation. The leaves are smaller and strap-like and shoots may be swollen, pale yellow and tinged with red. The fungus may also cause dense clusters of live and dead twig, called 'witches brooms'. Some authors suggest these {{are caused by}} the very similar Taphrina insititia.|$|R
50|$|Fatsia {{is a small}} genus {{of three}} species of {{evergreen}} shrubs native to southern Japan and Taiwan. They typically have stout, sparsely branched <b>stems</b> <b>bearing</b> spirally-arranged, large leathery, palmately lobed leaves 20-50 cm in width, on a petiole up to 50 cm long, and small creamy-white flowers in dense terminal compound umbels in late autumn or early winter, followed by small black fruit.|$|R
