5|$|Atmospheric {{passivation}} gives titanium excellent {{resistance to}} corrosion, almost equivalent to platinum. Titanium {{is capable of}} withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, chloride <b>solutions,</b> <b>and</b> most organic acids. However, titanium is corroded by concentrated acids. As indicated by its negative redox potential, titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal that burns in normal atmosphere at lower temperatures than the melting point. Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. At , it combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.|$|E
