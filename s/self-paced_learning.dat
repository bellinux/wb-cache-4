40|$|Abstract- Computer based {{courseware}} offer {{students the}} flexibility of self pace learning. In the telecommunication concentration at NJIT we developed a set of courseware modules that integrate remote access, animation, <b>self-pace</b> <b>learning,</b> and performance evaluation test. This {{is a part of}} the telecommunication curricula offered to the undergraduate population in the Electrical Engineering Technology program. The courseware material was developed and tested jointly with Lucent Technologies. In this paper we present a courseware designed to introduce students to many telecommunications concepts necessary for learners pursuing curricula in computer and data communications. Background The telecommunications curriculum includes four specific courses required for students in the telecommunication concentration, one of which is the applied telecommunications course. This course is offered in two independent modalities, traditional offering and a mixed delivery that includes synchronous and a synchronous distance learning modes. The synchronous/asynchronous delivery mode offers {{the flexibility of}} customizing the learning environment according to the learner's needs and circumstances. For instance, a distant student, may choose not to commute to campus, provided that he/she is a self starter and is comfortable with <b>self-pace</b> <b>learning.</b> On the other-hand an undergraduate student who is not comfortable with being, relatively, independent learner may choose to attend the traditional class. Materials offered in both delivery modes are the same, thus maintaining the integrity of the learning process, especially in our case where the course in question is an introductory course needed to continue with the rest of the curriculum. The applied telecommunication course cover a wide range of topics including • Basic telephony • Transmission concepts and transmission systems • T 1 /E 1 applications and systems • Switching concepts and systems with a study of Lucent Technologies private branch exchange (PBX) • Protocols and standards, focusing on the open system interconnection refernce mode...|$|R

Our research focuses on the digital literacy acquisition of underserved individuals such as immigrants, refugees, and individuals with limited English proficiency. In this paper, we examine a subset of data from a three-year mixed methods study on the digital literacy acquisition process of vulnerable adult learners within a <b>self-paced,</b> tutor-facilitated <b>learning</b> environment. Learners used an online learning platform designed for adult learners and available in Spanish and English. Learning took place in computer labs in six geographic regions within the United States and was supported by community tutors. We asked, what is the experience of Spanish speaking learners using the <b>self-paced,</b> tutor-facilitated <b>learning</b> environment for digital literacy acquisition? The data corpus includes interview transcripts and the findings are based on a grounded theory analysis of interviews of the Spanish speaking learners and tutors working in Spanish dominant learning environments. Data analysis indicated that individuals’ work in the digital literacy program supported English language learning as well as content learning. We identified tensions between the tutors’ desire to support content learning using first language skills and learner desire to build facility in English skills while learning content. Choice of language in which to learn was impacted by tutor preference and bias along with learner linguistic abilities and desire to develop English skills. We also found that language choice for learning was impacted by the learners’ comfort and facility in higher registers of Spanish. We argue that language should be used as a resource rather than being seen as a deficit and that tutors should be coached in the nuances of language choice when working with English Language Learners...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{multi-label}} learning framework, called Multi-Label <b>Self-Paced</b> <b>Learning</b> (MLSPL), {{in an attempt}} to incorporate the <b>self-paced</b> <b>learning</b> strategy into multi-label learning regime. In light of the benefits of adopting the easy-to-hard strategy proposed by <b>self-paced</b> <b>learning,</b> the devised MLSPL aims to learn multiple labels jointly by gradually including label learning tasks and instances into model training from the easy to the hard. We first introduce a self-paced function as a regularizer in the multi-label learning formulation, so as to simultaneously rank priorities of the label learning tasks and the instances in each learning iteration. Considering that different multi-label learning scenarios often need different self-paced schemes during optimization, we thus propose a general way to find the desired self-paced functions. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets suggest the state-of-the-art performance of our approach...|$|E
