Although the synthetic is still the primary energy-absorbent material, the wool plays a complementary role by increasing resistive interactions between the yarns and filaments. Wool restricts the lateral separation of the synthetic yarns and ensures that more directly impacted yarns are held in place to dissipate the impact energy. Wool increases the energy-absorption mechanism of yarn pull-in by increasing the longitudinal friction along the yarns/filaments, in particular near the free edges of the fabric layers.

Previous x-ray diffraction results showed a 1. 0 to 1. 5 % increase in myosin head spacing with activation; however, this increase in spacing has been interpreted as change {{in the state of the}} cross-bridges, not as elasticity in the thick filament backbone.

The myosin heads do not contribute to the 14. 4 -nm peak, which must come entirely from the backbone. Comparison with x-ray data from the unstriated Taenia coli muscle of the guinea pig indicates that in this muscle at least 75 % of the diffuse scatter comes from disordered myosin heads.

40|$|In {{the absence}} of C-protein, <b>synthetic</b> <b>filaments</b> {{prepared}} from column-purified myosin exhibit the following features: individual filament diameters are uniform over a long length, but a wide distribution of diameters is apparent over the population; approximately 25 % of the filaments have a frayed appearance and take up stain poorly, whereas the remaining 75 % are well-stained; optical diffraction of well-stained filaments reveals a 14. 3 -nm subunit period and a 43 -nm axial period (Koretz, 1978; Koretz, 1979). Addition of C-protein to myosin before filament formation affects all of these features in a manner related to C-protein concentration. At the physiological ratio of C-protein to myosin in the banded region of the natural thick filament, synthetic aggregates are uniform in diameter over the population and show less than 10 % frays. Whereas the subunit period remains unchanged, the axial period has increased to 114. 4 nm, or eight times the subunit repeat. Above and below the physiological ratio, disorder of a specific nature is apparent. Addition of C-protein after filament formation appears to coat the aggregates so that elements of backbone ultrastructure are obscured, and some evidence of axial period change is visible in diffraction patterns.

A similar result was obtained with native myosin filaments in a crude homogenate of scallop muscle. Proteolytic susceptibility under conditions in which ADP or adenosine 5 '-(beta, gamma-imidotriphosphate) (AMPPNP) replaced ATP was similar to that in the absence of nucleotide. Synthetic myosin filaments negatively stained under relaxing conditions showed a compact structure, in which the myosin cross-bridges were close to the filament backbone and well ordered, with a clear 14. 5 -nm axial repeat. Under activating or rigor conditions, the cross-bridges became clumped and disordered and frequently projected further from the filament backbone, as has been found with native filaments; when ADP or AMPPNP replaced ATP, the cross-bridges were also disordered. We conclude (a) that Ca 2 + and ATP affect the affinity of the myosin cross-bridges for the filament backbone or for each other; (b) that the changes observed in the myosin filaments reflect a property of the myosin molecules alone, and are unlikely to be an artifact of negative staining; and (c) that the ordered structure occurs only in the relaxed state, requiring both the presence of hydrolyzed ATP on the myosin heads and the absence of Ca 2 +...|$|E

Its induction and release involve Ca 2 +-dependent phosphatase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, respectively. Molecular mechanisms for catch remain obscure. Here, we describe a quantitative microscopic in vitro assay reconstituting the catch state with proteins isolated from catch muscles. Thick filaments attached to glass coverslips and pretreated with ≈ 10 − 4 M free Ca 2 + and soluble muscle proteins bound fluorescently labeled native thin filaments tightly in catch at ≈ 10 − 8 M free Ca 2 + in the presence of MgATP. At ≈ 10 − 4 M free Ca 2 +, the thin filaments moved at ≈ 4 μm/s. Addition of cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase at ≈ 10 − 8 M free Ca 2 + caused their release. Rabbit skeletal muscle F-actin filaments completely reproduced the results obtained with native thin filaments. Binding forces > 500 pN/μm between thick and F-actin filaments were measured by glass microneedles, and were sufficient to explain catch tension in vivo. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>filaments</b> of purified myosin and twitchin bound F-actin in catch, showing that other components of native thick filaments such as paramyosin and catchin are not essential.

The thin filament was selectively removed from bovine myocardium by gelsolin, and the actin filament was reconstituted, followed by further reconstitution with Tm and Tn. In this reconstitution, full-length Tm (control) was compared with Tm internal deletion mutant Δ 23 Tm, which lacks residues 47 – 123 (regions 2 – 3). The effects of phosphate, MgATP, MgADP and Ca 2 + were studied in Tm-reconstituted myocardium and Δ 23 Tm-reconstituted myocardium at pH 7. 00 and 25 °C. In Δ 23 Tm, both isometric tension and stiffness were about 40 % of the control. The Hill factor with Δ 23 Tm, deduced from the pCa-tension plot, was 1. 4 {{times that of}} the control, but the Ca 2 + sensitivity was the same. Sinusoidal analysis indicated that the cross-bridge number in force-generating states was not decreased with Δ 23 Tm. We conclude that the thin filament cooperativity is increased with Δ 23 Tm, presumably because of the increased density of the Ca 2 +-binding sites. We further conclude that tension per cross-bridge is 40 % of control and stiffness per cross-bridge is 40 % of control in Δ 23 Tm. These results are consistent with the idea that Tm modifies the actin-myosin interface so as to increase the stereospecific interaction between moieties of actin and myosin. In Δ 23 Tm, the interface may not have a perfect stereospecific match so that the tension- and stiffness-generating capacity is greatly diminished...|$|E
30|$|One of the {{significant}} texturing processes in current use, air-jet texturing, operates by mechanical interlocking and not by heat setting {{in the case of}} the other texturing techniques such as false-twist. It is a cold fluid texturing process that converts flat, continuous <b>synthetic</b> <b>filament</b> yarns into an entangled, convoluted, bulky, spun-like yarn. Air-jet texturing has three types based on the supply yarn. Single-end air-jet texturing denotes the situation whereby single filament yarn is overfed to the texturing nozzle, and the resultant textured yarn is withdrawn. In case of parallel air-jet texturing, two or more filaments yarns are fed at the same overfeed into the nozzle so as to facilitate a blend of different types of supply material, or of the same material but with different filament linear densities or number of filaments, or different cross sectional shapes. In core-effect air-jet texturing two different filament yarns are fed under different overfeeds into the air-jet at the same time. In core-effect air-jet texturing, the lower overfeed yarn is called the core-yarn and the higher overfeed yarn is called the effect-yarn. The core-yarn overfeed determines the strength of the textured yarn. The effect-yarn overfeed determines the size of the protruded loops. It also has an indirect influence upon the number of loops per unit length and also on the linear density. Perhaps the most important influence of the effect-yarn overfeed is to be seen in the structure and appearance of the yarn. This is because loops are seen on the surface of the yarn in the same way that hairs are visible in a spun yarn. However, there is limited literature on core-effect air-jet texturing or the influence of the effect-yarn parameters on air-jet texturing performance. Researchers have not given adequate prominence in core-effect air-jet texturing and most of the research limited to single-end air-je texturing. Wickramasinghe (2003) has investigated the use of steam as an alternative fluid for air in spun-like textured yarn manufacturing and studied the performance of sewing threads manufactured using core-effect steam-jet textured yarns. He reported that steam could be used as an alternative fluid for air in manufacturing core-effect spun-like textured sewing threads.|$|R

These oscillations, reminiscent of prokaryotic and eukaryotic flagellar motion, are obtained without having to invoke structural complexity or biochemical regulation. This minimality implies that biomimetic oscillations, previously observed only in complex bundles of active filaments, can be replicated in simple chains of generic chemomechanically active beads.

Changes in lattice spacing did {{not account for the}} total increase in birefrigence during relaxation. Moreover, the increase in total birefringence was attributable to increases in intrinsic birefringence as well as form birefringence. No change in birefringence was exhibited upon exposure to a relaxation solution after myosin extraction. <b>Synthetic</b> myosin <b>filaments</b> were prepared and treated with relaxation and rigor solutions. The negatively stained filaments treated with a rigor solution had gross irregular projections at either end, while the filaments treated with a relaxing solution were more spindle shaped. The results are compatible with the view that the subfragment- 2 moieties of myosin angle away from the myosin aggregates (light meromyosin) to permit the attachment of the subfragment- 1 moieties to actin...|$|R
