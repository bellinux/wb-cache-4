40|$|The carrier fringes {{method has}} been {{proposed}} <b>in</b> digital <b>photoelasticity</b> <b>in</b> combination with techniques such as Fourier transform and phase shifting method, without considering {{the influence of the}} isoclinics on the isochromatic patterns analysis. Unlike other optical methods as moiré and holographic interferometry, <b>in</b> <b>photoelasticity</b> the light intensity emerging from a circular polariscope is related to both the isochromatic retardation and the isoclinic parameter. As it is shown by the theoretical analysis, owing to the misalignment between the principal stresses in the model and in the carrier, the computed retardation is affected by an error which is the same for all photoelastic methods based on the use of carrier fringes. Consequently, the photoelastic analysis carried out by methods that use carrier fringes cannot be applied as a full-field technique. In detail, numerical simulations show that the retardation error is comparable (less than 0. 05 fringe orders) with that of other photoelastic methods provided that the misalignment between the principal stresses in the model and in the carrier is less than 30 °. On the contrary, in the model zones where the misalignment is higher than 30 °, the retardation measurement can be affected by non negligible errors (up to 0. 25 fringe orders) ...|$|R

40|$|The Poincare Equivalence Theorem {{states that}} any optical element which {{contains}} no absorbing components {{can be replaced}} by an equivalent optical model which consists of one linear retarder and one rotator only, {{both of which are}} uniquely determined. This has many useful applications in the field of Optics of Polarized Light. In particular, it arises naturally in attempts to reconstruct spatially varying refractive tensors or dielectric tensors from measurements of the change of state of polarization of light beams passing through the medium, a field which is known as Tensor Tomography. A special case is Photoelasticity, where the internal stress of a transparent material may be reconstructed from knowledge of the local optical tensors by using the stress-optical laws. - We present a rigorous approach to the Poincare Equivalence Theorem by explicitly proving a matrix decomposition theorem, from which the Poincare Equivalence Theorem follows as a corollary.

40|$|The {{use of the}} Fourier Polarimetry {{method has}} been {{demonstrated}} to extract the three characteristic parameters <b>in</b> integrated <b>photoelasticity.</b> <b>In</b> contrast to the phase-stepping method, {{it has been shown}} that the Fourier method is more accurate.

In this paper the Fourier transformation is used to derive the expression for determination of the characteristic parameters. Four Fourier coefficients are clearly identified to calculate the three characteristic parameters. It is found that the angular rotation ratio could be set arbitrarily. The angular rotation ratio is optimized to satisfy the requirements of efficiency and proper data accuracy, which results in data collection about three times faster than the methods suggested by previous researchers. When comparing their performance in terms of efficiency and accuracy, the simulated and experimental results show that these angular rotation ratios have the same accuracy but the optimized angular rotation ratio is significantly faster. The sensitivity to noise is also investigated and further improvement of accuracy is suggested...|$|R

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis deals with the {{application}} of a ruby laser to high speed photography. The light that is emitted from a ruby laser is monochromatic, collimated, coherent, linearly polarized, and highly intense. It has been demonstrated that these properties make the laser a very useful tool for research in areas involving photographic techniques. A method has been devised by which the output of the laser is controlled and is emitted {{in the form of a}} series of light pulses. The rate at which these pulses are generated can be controlled and repetition rates of over 1. 6 Mc/sec have been achieved. The 30 nsec duration of an individual pulse represents the exposure time for a high speed laser camera which has been developed. Pictures have been taken at rates of over 1. 2 million frames per second. This exposure time represents a reduction of an order of magnitude over that previously possible, with an increase of three orders of magnitude in intensity. In applications where a particular characteristic of the laser light is required, such as the monochromatic nature desired <b>in</b> <b>photoelasticity,</b> this improvement of four orders of magnitude is further increased. When a series of light pulses is generated in the manner described above it is found that the amplitude of the pulse train becomes stable above a certain critical frequency. This critical frequency is determined to be a function of the laser cavity length. The amplitude of the stabilized pulse train is a function of the repetition rate and the cavity length. The nature of this variation is established and a mechanistic explanation of the phenomena involved is presented...|$|R

In case of applying the model of generalized plane stressed state for investigating two-dimensional waves’ propagation in three-dimensional elastic medium it may be necessary to observe certain additional conditions, which for example limit the class of external impacts of high frequencies (short waves).

40|$|A full field {{automated}} polariscope for photoelastic {{analysis has}} been developed in the author's laboratory and has been described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, the system uses phase-stepping to determine both the fractional isochromatic fringes and isoclinic parameter at all points {{in the field of}} view independently of their neighbouring points. A wrapping algorithm is then employed to produce continuous ischromatic and isoclinic data, which can be subsequently be used in stress separation procedures. The idea of using phase stepping <b>in</b> <b>photoelasticity</b> is a fairly recent innovation and can be described as changing incremently the absolute phase of the reference wave by rotating the output elements of the polariscope and measuring the local light intensity after each step. In the apparatus described here, the output elements are rotated to six different positions providing six images of the specimen. Maps of the periodic values of the isoclinic and isochromatic parameters are subsequently obtained by combining, mathematically, these six images. A number of full field techniques have been developed. Poloshin and Redner have developed half fringe photoelasticity, and two laboratories in Japan are working on the technique of phase stepping. It appears, however, that no detailed evaluation has been made of the accuracy and reliability of the results generated by the technique. The objective of the work described in this paper has been provided such an evaluation. Five different models were selected for analysis using the automated system and manually using the Tardy compensation method: (a) a disk in diametral compression: (b) a constrained beam subject to a point load: (c) a tensile plate with a central hole: (d) a turbine blade; and (e) a turbine disk slot.

40|$|Photoelasticity {{has become}} a modern tool of stress {{analysis}} which is capable of competing with other tools employed currently, including finite element analysis. Improved model production and automated fringe analysis allow us to perform investigations of complex models, speeding up the rate of analysis and reducing the action by users, consequently automating the whole process. However, before automated fringe analysis, the mask of the model should be extracted. The authors discuss {{the development of a}} new algorithm to detect the mask of the model by analysing isochromatic fringe patterns used <b>in</b> <b>photoelasticity.</b> It is important to know the mask of the model for its analysis and to obtain a stress map. Unlike the available edge algorithms or any other techniques used to detect a model's mask, the proposed algorithm was developed to minimise user action, allowing the process to be automated. There is a major difference between the area of the background and area of the model from the point of view of image processing. Grey level of points inside the background region are distributed along the tilted plane with low total variance, and those points inside the model regions are distributed along the isochromatic fringes having the shape of a wave. The variance of certain areas is measured with respect to the approximated plane created over such area from the grey level of each point. Areas having low variance are then selected and extended to true boundaries based on the fact that edges are characterised by a huge jump in the grey level.
