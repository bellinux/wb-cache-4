5|$|Persons with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have no detectable systemic {{symptoms or}} signs (i.e., outside the mouth). Generally, symptoms may include prodromal sensations such as burning, itching, or stinging, which may precede {{the appearance of}} any lesion by some hours; and pain, which is often {{out of proportion to}} the extent of the ulceration and is worsened by physical contact, especially with certain foods and drinks (e.g., if they are acidic). Pain is worst in the days immediately following the initial formation of the ulcer, and then recedes as healing progresses. If there are lesions on the tongue, speaking and chewing can be uncomfortable, and ulcers on the <b>soft</b> <b>palate,</b> back of the throat, or esophagus can cause painful swallowing. Signs are limited to the lesions themselves.|$|E
5|$|This subtype {{makes up}} about 10% {{of all cases}} of aphthous stomatitis. It is termed major aphthous {{ulceration}} (MaAU) or major recurrent aphthous stomatitis (MaRAS). Major aphthous ulcers (major aphthae) are similar to minor aphthous ulcers, but are more than 10mm in diameter and the ulceration is deeper. Because the lesions are larger, healing takes longer (about twenty to thirty days), and may leave scars. Each episode of ulceration usually produces {{a greater number of}} ulcers, and the time between attacks is less than seen in minor aphthous stomatitis. Major aphthous ulceration usually affects non keratinized mucosal surfaces, but less commonly keratinized mucosa may also be involved, such as the dorsum (top surface) of the tongue or the gingiva (gums). The <b>soft</b> <b>palate</b> or the fauces (back of the throat) may also be involved, the latter being part of the oropharynx rather than the oral cavity. Compared to minor aphthous ulceration, major aphthae tend to have an irregular outline.|$|E

50|$|Quantitative {{analyses}} {{have been}} done on bilateral and unilateral cleft palate to better understand geometric differences in cleft palate {{throughout the course of}} its development and correction. Despite the difficulty in finding common, comparable landmarks between normal <b>soft</b> <b>palates</b> and cleft palates, analytical methods have been devised to assess differences in degree of curvature of the alveolar crest, two-dimensional and three-dimensional surface area, and slope of the alveolar crest.|$|R
50|$|In mammals the {{buccal cavity}} is {{typically}} roofed by the hard and <b>soft</b> <b>palates,</b> floored by the tongue {{and surrounded by}} the cheeks, salivary glands, upper and lower teeth. The upper teeth are embedded in the upper jaw and the lower teeth in the lower jaw, which articulates with the temporal bones of the skull. The lips are soft and fleshy folds which shape the entrance into the mouth. The buccal cavity empties through the pharynx into the oesophagus.|$|R
5|$|Many {{classification}} {{systems have}} been developed {{in an effort to}} predict difficulty of tracheal intubation, including the Cormack-Lehane classification system, the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS), and the Mallampati score. The Mallampati score is drawn from the observation that the size of the base of the tongue influences the difficulty of intubation. It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the mouth, and in particular the visibility of the base of palatine uvula, faucial pillars and the <b>soft</b> <b>palate.</b> Although such medical scoring systems may aid in the evaluation of patients, no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only those patients who are difficult to intubate. Furthermore, one study of experienced anesthesiologists, on the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system, found they did not score the same patients consistently over time, and that only 25% could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system. Under certain emergency circumstances (e.g., severe head trauma or suspected cervical spine injury), it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation. In such cases, alternative techniques of securing the airway must be readily available.|$|E

40|$|Burning mouth {{syndrome}} (BMS) is characterised by {{the presence}} of a burning sensation in the oral mucosa {{in the absence of any}} clinically apparent mucosal sign. It occurs more commonly in older women and often affects the tongue tip and lateral borders, lips, and hard and <b>soft</b> <b>palates.</b> Besides the burning sensation, patients with BMS may complain of unremitting oral mucosal pain, dysgeusia, and xerostomia. The exact pathophysiology of primary BMS remains unknown. A major challenge for the clinician is the treatment of BMS: identifying possible causative factors is the first step, but BMS is often idiopathic. Drug therapy, in addition to behavioural therapy and psychotherapy, may help to eliminate the symptoms. Considering the growing incidence of BMS in older people, further research is required to determine the true efficacy of current management strategies for patients with this disorder.

40|$|For {{some time}} Norwich terriers {{have been known}} to suffer from {{respiratory}} problems. In order to assign this weakness to a pathophysiology, 23 terriers were examined clinically, with laryngoscope and with rhinomanometry. In addition their skulls were dimensioned on radiographs. Widened nostrils, overlong <b>soft</b> <b>palates</b> and the everted laryngeal pouches were consistent with brachycephalic syndrome. Resistance values in the nasal passage corresponded to the appearance in brachycephalic dogs. Skull measurements gave inconsistent results, because length to width ratios and craniofacial angles denoted mesaticephaly, whereas the facial to cranial length ratios (S-index = 0. 65) lay in the brachycephalic sector. It can be concluded, that the Norwich terrier breed is in transition towards brachycephaly with some individual dogs already suffering from the brachycephalic syndrome. Breeders are requested to introduce necessary counter measures...|$|R
40|$|CLEFTS of {{the upper}} lip (hare lip syndromes) are common in human beings and clefts of the hard and/or <b>soft</b> <b>palates</b> are {{relatively}} common in many species, including the horse (Gaughan and deBowes 1993).

Bifid tongue and mandibular clefts are, however, extremely rare in any species. Over the past 150 years, only 46 cases have been recorded in human patients (Millard 1977).

40|$|There are fi ve basic tastes. They are: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. The Japanese word “umami ” {{translates}} as “pleasant to the taste, agreeable, good, mild, savory, delicious. ” Umami is also described as “meaty. ” Sources of the taste include monosodium glutamate (MSG), broth, and shiitake mushrooms. Taste begins when taste molecules in food enter a pore {{at the top}} of the taste bud. Taste buds are located throughout the mouth, including on the <b>soft</b> <b>palates</b> and larynx. Contrary to what is published in many textbooks, all taste buds respond to all fi ve basic tastes. Taste buds can’t be seen without a microscope.

40|$|Pleomorphic adenoma is {{the most}} common {{neoplasm}} in major and minor salivary glands. It constitutes approximately 90 % of all benign salivary gland lesions and the parotid {{is the most}} affected location. When the minor salivary glands are affected, it mostly occurs at the junction of the hard and <b>soft</b> <b>palates.</b> The diagnosis is complex because of the great histological variety and biological behavior of this tumor, a histopathological examination being essential. The recommended treatment is surgical excision. For lesions located superficially in the parotid gland, superficial parotidectomy - identifying and preserving the facial nerve - is necessary. Lesions in the palate or gums sometimes demand a margin of safety, being excised below the periosteum, including the overlying mucosa. With correct surgical removal, the prognosis is excellent. The aim {{of this study is to}} report a case of an unusual minor salivary gland pleomorphic adenoma in the hard palate, describing the most important aspects of this pathology...|$|R

40|$|Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) was {{diagnosed}} in eight calves from four {{farms in the}} United Kingdom {{on the basis of}} clinical, histological and ultrastructural findings. In three affected herds, pedigree Simmental bulls had been mated with Simmental-cross cows. In a fourth herd two Holstein-Friesian calves were affected. Lesions included multifocal erosion and ulceration of the hard and <b>soft</b> <b>palates,</b> tongue, nares and gingiva, with onychomadesis (dysungulation). There was alopecia, erosion and crusting of the coronets, pasterns, fetlocks, carpi, hocks, flanks and axillae. Histopathological findings included segmental separation of full thickness epidermis from the dermis, with formation of large clefts containing eosinophilic fluid, extravasated red blood cells and small numbers of neutrophils. Follicular and interfollicular areas of skin were affected, with clefts extending around hair follicles and sometimes involving whole follicles. Ultrastructurally, there was evidence of vacuolar change within basal keratinocytes, corresponding to areas of histological clefting. Preliminary genetic screening of the candidate keratin genes (bKRT 5 and bKRT 14) has excluded mutations of these as the cause of this condition...|$|R

40|$|To provide {{information}} concerning biosynthetic activities within the mesenchymal cells of rat palatal shelves, {{the numbers of}} nucleolar organiser regions (NORs) were detected using an Ag-NOR staining technique within tissues obtained from coronal sections of 30 fetal heads prepared for light microscopy. The study involved comparisons between stages of palatogenesis and between location along the palatal shelves, anterior and posterior regions being analysed to correspond to the presumptive hard and <b>soft</b> <b>palates.</b> For both anterior and posterior regions, the mean Ag-NOR count/cell was initially high (approximately 3. 4 anteriorly and approximately 3. 0 posteriorly). The count/cell decreased significantly immediately after elevation but increased again after shelf reorientation and complete fusion. When comparisons were made between anterior and posterior regions of the palatal shelves, no differences were discerned at a stage prior to elevation (day 15) and a stage after the shelves had elevated and completely fused (day 17). Immediately post-elevation (day 16. 5), however, the mean count/cell was significantly higher anteriorly. Thus the degree of mesenchymal cell activity, as {{expressed in terms of}} protein biosynthesis, can change in the developing palate according to both site and stage of development...|$|R

He reported not having sanitized the area for years for fear of bleeding. Periodontal management, to remove calculus and to control gingivitis initiated in the supragingival region and gradually reaching the subgingival region to control oral microbiota, was performed with mild bleeding. The redness of the staining greatly diminished with time and the extreme halitosis of the patient also improved sharply leading to a dramatic improvement in quality of life.

40|$|Objective: Since 1997, common oral clefts in the Netherlands {{have been}} {{recorded}} in the national oral cleft registry using a unique descriptive recording system. This study validates data on the topographic-anatomical structure, morphology, and side of individual anomalies of the primary palate and secondary palate that form the oral cleft. Design: Validation study. Setting: All 15 Dutch cleft palate teams reporting presurgery oral cleft patients to the national registry. Patients: A random sample of 250 cases registered in the national database with oral clefts from 1997 through 2003; of these, 13 cases were excluded. Main Outcome Measures: By linking registry data with clinical data, we identified differential recording rates by comparing the prevalence, and we measured the degree of agreement by computing validity and reliability statistics. Results: The topographic-anatomical structures (lip, alveolus, and hard and <b>soft</b> <b>palates)</b> of the anomalies had near-perfect interdatabase agreement with a sensitivity of 88 % to 99 %. However, when analyzing the individual anomalies in detail (morphology and side), validity decreased and depended on morphological severity. This association was most evident for anomalies of the secondary palate. For example, sensitivity was higher for ''complete cleft hard palate'' (92 %) than for ''submucous cleft hard/soft palate'' (69 %). Conclusions: Overall, the validity of Dutch registry data on oral clefts is good, supporting the feasibility of this unique recording system. However, when analyzing oral cleft data in detail, the quality appears {{to be related to}} anatomical location and morphological severity. This might have implications for etiologic research based on registry data and for guidelines on neonatal examination. © Copyright 2012 American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association...|$|R
40|$|The human {{oral cavity}} {{contains}} {{a number of}} different habitats, including the teeth, gingival sulcus, tongue, cheeks, hard and <b>soft</b> <b>palates,</b> and tonsils, which are colonized by bacteria. The oral microbiome is comprised of over 600 prevalent taxa at the species level, with distinct subsets predominating at different habitats. The oral microbiome has been extensively characterized by cultivation and culture-independent molecular methods such as 16 S rRNA cloning. Unfortunately, the vast majority of unnamed oral taxa are referenced by clone numbers or 16 S rRNA GenBank accession numbers, often without taxonomic anchors. The first aim of this research was to collect 16 S rRNA gene sequences into a curated phylogeny-based database, the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD), and make it web accessible (www. homd. org). The HOMD includes 619 taxa in 13 phyla, as follows: Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chlamydiae, Chloroflexi, Euryarchaeota, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, SR 1, Synergistetes, Tenericutes, and TM 7. The second aim was to analyze 36, 043 16 S rRNA gene clones isolated from studies of the oral microbiota to determine the relative abundance of taxa and identify novel candidate taxa. The analysis identified 1, 179 taxa, of which 24 % were named, 8 % were cultivated but unnamed, and 68 % were uncultivated phylotypes. Upon validation, 434 novel, nonsingleton taxa will be added to the HOMD. The number of taxa needed to account for 90 %, 95 %, or 99 % of the clones examined is 259, 413, and 875, respectively.
