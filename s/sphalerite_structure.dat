40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the discussion of the limitations and the opportunities of super-resolution imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) as these are determined by the dynamical interaction of the electron wave with the potential distribution in the local environment of atoms. Throughout most of the thesis, the assumption of a perfect crystal structure is made, in which case super-resolution imaging is a straightforward extension to a technique called 'ptychography', which was introduced by Walter Hoppe in the sixties as a means of directly measuring phases of diffraction orders. The dynamical theory of high-energy electron scattering and its computation are reviewed with an emphasis on the specific scattering geometry of ptychography. The interpretation of ptychographical reconstructions and the validity range of two simple reconstruction methods are discussed, using calculations on silicon aligned along. The investigation is continued for the case of <b>sphalerite</b> <b>structures</b> (again along), which are asymmetric and thus more complicated. Experiments on gallium phosphide are presented in which the length scale of resolved detail is reduced by a factor of three in the particular microscope used and the reconstructed images show the locations of individual atomic columns. A new technique to measure the polarity of semiconductor nanocrystals based on the direct measurement of the quasi-kinematical phases of the diffraction discs is introduced and demonstrated experimentally. The imaging theory is extended to the case of aperiodic structures, and it is argued that a reconstruction technique referred to as aberration-free projection imaging is particularly suited for the examination of amorphous structures. Finally, a brief analysis of the inversion problem and its relevance for super-resolution imaging is carried out...|$|R

In this work, nanoclusters are created by ion implantation followed by thermal annealing. The ceramic oxides MgO and Al 2 O 3 are used as embedding materials because of their stability and optical transparency. All clusters were created by means of ion implantation (typical dose 1016 ions cm- 2, energy range 0. 031. 0 MeV) and subsequent thermal annealing (temperature 9001300 K). Many experimental techniques were applied to investigate the defect evolution and {{the properties of the}} nanoclusters, amongst others optical absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and positron annihilation spectroscopy. The formation, growth and dissociation of He and Kr bubbles in MgO and Al 2 O 3 was investigated. It is found that the Kr nanoclusters in MgO are solid and have the fcc crystal structure. The lattice parameter of the Kr in individual clusters was found to vary {{as a function of the}} cluster size. Metallic Li, Zn, Ag and Au nanoclusters in MgO are also studied. XRD and TEM investigations reveal that Ag and Au nanoclusters are in a cube-on-cube orientation relationship with the rocksalt MgO. Large Li clusters (> 40 nm) have the bcc crystal structure, while small Li clusters (< 20 nm) adopt the unusual fcc crystal structure. The MgO:Li system exhibits very strong positron confinement. The positron wavefunction is three-dimensionally spatially confined in the nanoclusters, so that 95 % of the positrons annihilate in Li nanoclusters even though the atomic concentration of Li is only 1. 3 at. %. Semiconductor CdSe nanoclusters are created by sequential Cd and Se ion implantation. TEM analysis reveals that CdSe nanoclusters smaller than 5 nm have the unusual rocksalt crystal structure, while nanoclusters larger than 10 nm have the <b>sphalerite</b> or wurtzite <b>structure.</b> It can be concluded that nanoclusters are easily created in ceramic oxides by ion implantation and exhibit fascinating size-dependent {{material properties}}.
