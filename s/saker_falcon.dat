5|$|A 2014 {{study of}} falcons of {{different}} species (gyrfalcon, <b>saker</b> <b>falcon,</b> and peregrine falcon) used video cameras mounted {{on their heads}} or backs to track their approaches to prey. Comparison of the observed paths with simulations of different pursuit strategies showed that these predatory birds used a motion camouflage path consistent with CATD.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamsters {{may also}} live near areas of human civilization. In Mongolia, {{they may be}} found in yurts to keep warm during the winter, as they do not have {{thermoregulation}} like the Djungarian hamster. They have five main predators: the Eurasian eagle owl, the steppe eagle, the corsac fox, the common kestrel, and the <b>saker</b> <b>falcon.</b> All distribution areas have more females than males, because males are at higher risk from predators, as they cannot move as quickly.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus cassini, {{described}} by Sharpe in 1873, {{is also known}} as the Austral peregrine falcon. It includes kreyenborgi, the pallid falcon, a leucistic morph occurring in southernmost South America, which was long believed to be a distinct species. Its range includes South America from Ecuador through Bolivia, northern Argentina, and Chile to Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands. It is non-migratory. It is similar to nominate, but slightly smaller with a black ear region. The variation kreyenborgi is medium grey above, has little barring below, and has a head pattern like the <b>saker</b> <b>falcon,</b> but the ear region is white.|$|E
50|$|Falco antiquus is an {{extinct species}} of falcon lived during the Middle Pleistocene in {{southern}} Europe. It {{is thought to}} be the common ancestor of modern gyrfalcons and <b>saker</b> <b>falcons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Birds {{for which}} the site is {{important}} include <b>saker</b> <b>falcons,</b> solitary snipe, European rollers, Hume's larks, sulphur-bellied warblers, wallcreepers, brown accentors, water pipits, fire-fronted serins, crimson-winged finches, red-mantled rosefinches and white-winged grosbeaks.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is a large}} falcon, at 43 - 50 cm length with a {{wingspan}} of 95 - 105 cm. European lanner falcons (Falco biarmicus feldeggi, {{also called}} Feldegg's falcon) have slate grey or brown-grey upperparts; most African subspecies are a paler blue grey above. The breast is streaked in northern birds, resembling greyish <b>saker</b> <b>falcons,</b> but the lanner has a reddish back to the head. Sexes are similar, but the browner young birds resemble <b>saker</b> <b>falcons</b> even more. However, sakers have a lighter {{top of the head}} and less clear head-side patterns. The lanner's call is a harsh [...] "wray-e".|$|R
5|$|Opportunistic {{and highly}} adaptable, the western jackdaw varies its diet {{markedly}} depending on available food sources. They {{have been recorded}} taking eggs and nestlings from the nests of the skylark (Alauda arvensis), Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), razorbill (Alca torda), common murre (Uria aalge), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), rock pigeon (Columba livia), and Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto). A field study of a large city dump {{on the outskirts of}} León in northwestern Spain showed that western jackdaws forage there in the early morning and at dusk, and engage in some degree of kleptoparasitism. The <b>saker</b> <b>falcon</b> (Falco cherrug) has been reported stealing food from western jackdaws on powerlines in Vojvodina in Serbia.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon {{belongs to a}} genus whose lineage includes the hierofalcons and the prairie falcon (F.mexicanus). This lineage probably diverged from other falcons {{towards the end of}} the Late Miocene or in the Early Pliocene, about 5–8million years ago (mya). As the peregrine-hierofalcon group includes both Old World and North American species, it is likely that the lineage originated in western Eurasia or Africa. Its relationship to other falcons is not clear, as the issue is complicated by widespread hybridization confounding mtDNA sequence analyses. For example, a genetic lineage of the <b>saker</b> <b>falcon</b> (F.cherrug) is known which originated from a male saker producing fertile young with a female peregrine ancestor, and the descendants further breeding with sakers.|$|E
25|$|The {{endangered}} species reported are: Atlantic petrel (Pterodroma incerta), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) and <b>saker</b> <b>falcon</b> (Falco cherrug).|$|E
50|$|<b>Saker</b> <b>falcons</b> have brown upperbellies and {{contrasting}} grey flight feathers. The {{head and}} underparts are paler brown, with streaking from the breast down. Males (called sakrets in falconry) and females are similar, as are young birds, although these {{tend to be}} a duller brown. The call is a sharp kiy-ee.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} {{classified}} as an IBA because it supports significant numbers of the populations of various bird species, either as residents, or as breeding or passage migrants. These include <b>saker</b> <b>falcons,</b> cinereous vultures, European rollers, Upcher's warblers, plain leaf-warblers, white-throated robins, Finsch's wheatears, variable wheatears, chestnut-breasted buntings and grey-necked buntings.|$|R
50|$|The marshy {{habitat is}} most {{attractive}} for water bird {{species such as}} common teal, shell duck, mallard, pochard, flamingo and pelican.

2500|$|The genus Falco {{is found}} {{worldwide}} and has occupied a central niche in {{ancient and modern}} falconry. [...] Most falcon species used in falconry are specialized predators, most adapted to capturing bird prey such as the peregrine falcon and merlin. [...] A notable exception {{is the use of}} desert falcons such the <b>saker</b> <b>falcon</b> in ancient and modern Middle Eastern and Asian falconry, where hares were and are commonly taken. In North America, the prairie falcon and the gyrfalcon can capture small mammal prey (as well as gamebirds and waterfowl) in falconry, but this is rarely practiced. [...] Young falconers often begin practicing the art with American kestrels, the smallest of the falcons in North America; there is debate on whether this practice should continue. Small species, such as kestrels, merlins and hobbys can also be used for recreational bug hawking – that is, hunting large flying insects such as dragonflies and moths.|$|E
2500|$|Falconry is {{currently}} practiced {{in many countries}} around the world. [...] The falconer's traditional choice of bird is the northern goshawk and peregrine falcon. In contemporary falconry in both North America and the UK they remain popular, although the Harris hawk and red-tailed hawk are likely more widely used. [...] The northern goshawk and the golden eagle are more commonly used in Eastern Europe than elsewhere. [...] In the Middle East, the <b>saker</b> <b>falcon</b> is the most traditional species flown against the houbara bustard, sandgrouse, stone-curlew, other birds and hares. Peregrines and other captively bred imported falcons are also commonplace. Falconry remains {{an important part of}} the Arab heritage and culture. [...] The UAE reportedly spends over 27 million dollars annually towards the protection and conservation of wild falcons, and has set up several state-of-the-art falcon hospitals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital is the largest falcon hospital in the whole world. [...] There are two breeding farms in the Emirates, as well as those in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. [...] Every year, falcon beauty contests and demonstrations take place at the ADIHEX exhibition in Abu Dhabi.|$|E
