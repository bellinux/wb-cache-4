The treatment of choice for heroin addiction is opioid-agonist treatment and is supported by numerous studies stretching over 40 years. It needs to be stressed that the outcomes for detoxification from opioids are poor. As Dr Cathal Ó Súilliobháin highlighted in his original response (IMT, June 11, ‘Resources must target proven treatments’; <b>see</b> <b>www.</b> imt. ie/opinion/letters/ 2010 / 06 /resources-must-target-proven-treatments. html), there is the added risk of fatal overdose due to loss of opioid tolerance...|$|R
