40|$|This paper {{compares the}} U value and energy {{consumption}} of typical curtainwall glazing systems used in commercial buildings. These glazing practices are {{popular in the}} major cities of the world. There are four basic types of systems that are compared.) Glazing systems that use Insulating glass which are mechanically fixed in gaskets, 2) 4 sided structural silicone glazed with wet weatherseals, 3) 4 sided structural silicone glazed with dry gasket weatherseal, and 4) Hybrid glazing system (structurally clamped). The thermal modeling is performed based upon WinIso 2 D using three different IG unit designs {{for the first three}} systems noted above. The IG unit designs evaluated are:) aluminium spacer 2) stainless steel spacer, and 3) warm edge spacer technology. The hybrid glazing system is modeled only with an aluminum spacer. After calculating the U Value for a system, the results can be used to demonstrate how to evaluate the energy consumption for a specific system in a specific location, and compare these results relative to different configurations. This paper details that mechanically fixed systems demonstrate good initial performance, but the aging <b>of</b> <b>gaskets</b> results in shrinkage. Furthermore, compression <b>set</b> <b>of</b> the <b>gaskets</b> allows additional air and water infiltration, rendering the system even less effective. Gasket joint systems also allow additional exposure to the elements of the middle of the aluminum system which further decreases the energy efficiency. Structural glazed systems using the warm edge technology provides an excellent U value and results in the most energy efficient system modeled...|$|R

40|$|The {{deflections}} <b>of</b> <b>gaskets</b> {{after initial}} tightening largely affect the residual bolt {{forces and the}} tightness of bolted flanged connections. The bolt forces decrease significantly due to the deflections <b>of</b> <b>gaskets</b> after initial tightening in the cases where expanded PTFE gaskets are used. The visco-elastic characteristic <b>of</b> the <b>gaskets</b> is the main cause for the phenomenon. It was shown in the paper PVP 2012 - 78694 that the tightness improved even if the bolt forces reduced in the long term. This is because the gasket becomes packed under a high gasket stress. It is important to estimate the thickness change <b>of</b> <b>gaskets</b> to evaluate the tightness of bolted flanged connections. In this paper, an analytical model of a bolted flanged connection, in which the flanges, the bolts and the gasket are represented by spring constants, is proposed. Experiments were carried out to measure the creep characteristic of the expanded PTFE gasket. The residual bolt forces and the deflection <b>of</b> the <b>gasket</b> were estimated based on the analytical model of the bolted flanged connection and the creep characteristic <b>of</b> the <b>gasket.</b> Thus, the relationship between gasket deflection and the tightness of the bolted flanged connection are clarified...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. – We {{investigate}} the integrated {{density of states}} of a Sturm–Liouville operator d dm d dx when the measure m is constructed from a self-similar measure on the interval [0, 1]. We show that this involves the dynamics of a rational map on the complex projective plane P 2, and we give an explicit formula for the integrated density of states {{in terms of the}} Green function of this map. This allows to deduce several results on the structure of the integrated density of states by a study of the dynamics of this map. This operator is a particular case of the so-called diffusions on self-similar sets and is relevant in this context. Indeed it is the first example, except for the <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> the Sierpinski <b>gasket</b> type (usually called decimable), where a connection is established between the spectrum of the operator and the dynamics of the iterates of a certain rational map. Therefore it is a new step toward a generalization of the initial work of Rammal and Toulouse (1983) and Rammal (1984). 2001 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SA...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel measurement set-up {{dedicated to the}} characterization {{of the evolution of}} the high-frequency shielding-effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>gaskets</b> due to corrosion and ageing. The measurement set-up is based on the recently introduced stripline set-up which has been validated previously up to 40 GHz. Compared to the original stripline set-up, the adapted set-up has a removable “clamping module” which can be easily mounted and removed from the set-up. The clamping module allows to age the gasket inside e. g. a climate chamber while always keeping the gasket under the same compression rate. As the clamping module can be made out of different materials, it allows to study the influence <b>of</b> shielding-effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>gaskets</b> when applied to different materials. In order to avoid parallel leakage inside the measurement set-up, a high-performant gasket needs to be compressed below the module. Based on full-wave simulations, it is shown that the shielding-effectiveness given by this gasket underneath the clamping module is the main determining factor for the dynamic range of the set-up. In addition, a first <b>set</b> <b>of</b> measurements show the validity of the measurement set-up and approach. status: publishe...|$|R
