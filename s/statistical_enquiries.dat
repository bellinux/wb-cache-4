May we express a wish? That is, that the Solvay Institute employ its resources and the work of its students in a patient and minute observation of social phenomena.

40|$|A. Retel-Laurentin—Women's Absconding in the Black Volta. In the Black Volta {{district}} of the Voltaic Republic, many Bwa women surrepti-tiously desert their husband's {{home at night}} to seek refuge with another man. This man is not considered guilty of adultery but rather {{of a kind of}} theft or kidnapping. The deserted husband may recover his wife by legal action, {{with the help of his}} own kin. Far from chastising her if and when she cornes back, he 'flatters' her by various gifts, sometimes extended to her family. This occurs in a society which considers marriage as irreversible. Relying on anthropological and <b>statistical</b> <b>enquiries,</b> the author shows that the apparent disparity between legal rule and actual pratice implies a tacit agreement of the group. Women's absconding does probabiy act as a regulating mechanism in a System in which endogamy and endo-local residence might otherwise lessen exchanges to a dangerous degree.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the contribution}} of economics and statistics in the transformation of Ghana from colonial dependency to socialist one-party state. The narrative begins in 1948, extending through the years of decolonization, and ends in 1966, when the first postcolonial government led by Kwame Nkrumah was overthrown by a military coup d’état. Drawing on insights from political economy, the history of economics and the sociology of science, the study is constructed {{as a series of}} microhistories of public institutions, social scientists, <b>statistical</b> <b>enquiries</b> and development plans. In the period under consideration economics and statistics underwent a radical transformation in their political use. This transformation is epitomised by the two extremes mentioned in the title: the ‘scattered data’ of 1950 s household budget surveys were expression of the limited will and capacity of the colonial state to exercise control over different areas of the country. In contrast, the 1960 s dream of a monolithic one-party state led the political rulers to use Marxist-Leninist political economy as a cornerstone of the ideological education aiming at creating the ideal citizen of the socialist regime. Based on research in British and Ghanaian archives, the study claims that economists and statisticians provided important cognitive tools to imagine competing alternatives to the postcolonial nation state, finding its most extreme version in the attempt to fashion a new type of economics supporting Nkrumah’s dream of a Pan-African political and economic union. At a more general level, the thesis provides a step towards a deeper incorporation of Sub-Saharan Africa in the history of economics and statistics, by depicting it not simply as an importer of ideas and scientific practices, but as a site in which the interaction of local and foreign political and scientific visions turned economics and statistics into powerful tools of social engineering. These tools created new spaces for political support and dissent, and shifted the boundaries between the possible and the utopian...|$|E

40|$|Statistical {{literacy}} {{is regarded as}} essential for good citizenship, employment, and practical day-to-day living. The ubiquitous nature of data and computers in contemporary society has increased both the need for statistical literacy and the means of developing statistical literacy. This study investigated students’ acceptance of Fathom® virtual simulation and resampling as a legitimate mathematics tool, {{the teaching and learning}} of the explicit determination of sample size when sampling from large populations, and students’ development of use of Fathom statistics education software. The study was conducted as a three-week long classroom unit of work taught in two Year 9 classes and a detailed study of twelve students in Tasmania, Australia. Pedagogical best practice principles derived from statistics education research guided the study. These included engagement with the big ideas of statistics, active learning and data sets students can understand and value, <b>statistical</b> <b>enquiry</b> that cultivates <b>statistical</b> habits of mind, the use of technology tools that allows students to explore data and concepts, mathematical experiences of substance, provision of a developmental pathway for students to study statistics at more senior years, and authentic assessment. Fathom was developed for senior high school and tertiary study, and its use in Australian high schools is relatively novel. Students’ unfamiliarity with the software presented at least two challenges: developing acceptance of Fathom’s virtual resampling probability simulator as a legitimate mathematical tool and acquiring basic fluency in the software’s use such that the software was not a constraint on learning. Students’ acceptance of the probability simulator was cultivated purposefully through a process of formal <b>statistical</b> <b>enquiry</b> where students examined the fairness of the Fathom virtual die. Students’ development of use of Fathom re-sampling was examined from the three aspects of key terminology, graphical data representations, and their relationship with Fathom. The principles of instrumental genesis guided the introduction to, and the examination of, students’ use of Fathom. Sample size is presently ignored in the high school curriculum, and students may complete formal school education with unsophisticated notions of sample size, possibly first acquired in upper primary school. The sample size model e=+/Vn, which relates the sample size n, to the margin of error e, of the accuracy of measurement, was used in this study. A foremost consideration was that the model was potentially accessible and that students could apply their understanding in a real-life context. Large populations were studied because formal mathematical treatment is relatively simple. Students’ work samples were assessed using the SOLO taxonomy, and situated abstraction was used to observe students’ development of understanding of selected mathematical concepts. The study concluded that a process of <b>statistical</b> <b>enquiry</b> may be used both to promote acceptance of virtual simulation and to foster the development of statistical “habits of mind. ” The sample size model e=+/Vn has application in Year 9 principally to mathematise traditional Law of Large Numbers activities, where the computing power of virtual simulation allows exploration of very large sample sizes. The introduction of re-sampling and the sample size model in Year 9 provides the foundation for the consideration of contextual tasks in more senior school years. The study suggests that Fathom is suitable for Year 9 students, but recommends further research in the use of re-sampling to exploit fully the software’s potential...|$|R

40|$|Method: We {{examined}} 423 cervical spine MRI scans, {{belonging to}} patients who had been admitted to the Medical Imaging Service of the Military Hospital of Rome between January 2010 and July 2011. We selected 6 parameters {{for the analysis of}} the MRI scans of the cervical spine: (1) the degeneration of the intervertebral discs, (2) the degeneration of the yellow ligaments, (3) the degeneration of the vertebral bodies, (4) the possible presence of spondylolistheses, (5) {{the presence or absence of}} foraminal stenosis, and (6) the diameter of the spinal canal. We assigned to each parameter a score system based on a graduated scale. The cervical spine physiological age can be determined by summing up the scores obtained for each parameter. Results: We submitted the data obtained from the study to a <b>statistical</b> <b>enquiry.</b> The results of the enquiry confirmed the suitability of the parameters selected for the evaluation of the aging process of the cervical spine. Conclusions: The effectiveness of the various treatments for cervical spine degenerative disorders is influenced by the overall anatomical conditions of the cervical spine. Up until now there has been no objective criterion for the evaluation of these anatomical conditions. We believe that this scale will be a useful tool to homogenize retrospective studies and to correctly set up prospective studies on the degenerative conditions of the cervical spine and relative treatments. Purpose: This article aims at presenting a scale that, through the analysis of MRI images, clearly charts the various degenerative stages of the cervical spine and establishes its biological age.

Results from municipality repre- sentatives give a realistic information about economic situation of a municipality government and thus provide researchers valuable data for a comprehensive evaluation of a economic level quality in municipalities. As the phase of questionnaire back sending was closed there were stated following partial conclusions: - The most important reason of economical „weakness“ of a municipality is the absence of service sector; - Main signs of economical „weakness“ of a municipality are: low fiscal profit of a municipality, low-income level of inhabitants and absence of investor‘s concern about the area; - The total sum for Liberec region development for 90 municipalities amounts to 6, 233 milli- ards CZK which means approximately 29 400 per one inhabitant; - 37 % of municipalities assume that any improvement of economical situation of a municipality is „a long distance race“; - According to a Liberec region methodology 53 % of respondents is included in the category „Economically depressed area“. Nevertheless 82 % percent of respondents account themsel- ves to areas which are complexly depressed or partially depressed; - 65 % of respondents in total indicated their position in accordance with the methodology of a regional authority; - As characteristics of economical „weakness“ of municipalities in the category „Economically depressed areas“ were identify among others the absence of interest of investors and deve- lopers in these areas...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{detailed}} study {{of several of the}} most controversial aspects of parliamentary enclosure. The extent to which some of the allegations of contemporary and modern writers can be applied to Leicestershire is examined, and the limitations of the historical sources for a <b>statistical</b> <b>enquiry</b> pointed out. This work has two principal objects. The first is to show why and how enclosures took place in this county, and to discover how far a conflict of interests between the various social classes arose. The work of the enclosure commission was of fundamental importance, and therefore the appointment and the procedure of the Leicestershire commissioners are examined in detail and their integrity assessed. The case study of the enclosure of Whitwick illustrates the nature and volume of pre-enclosure negotiations amongst the leading interests in the parish, and shows how the administrative and legal problems, which arose after the Act was passed, were overcome. A subsidiary study is made {{of the extent to which}} direct influence was exerted in the unreformed Commons over Members dealing with enclosure Bills. The second object is to analyse the principal social and economic effects of enclosure. Thus the factors bringing about changes in the distribution of landownership, notably the cost of enclosure and the commutation of tithes, are considered in detail. The land tax returns reveal that, although the large proprietors and farmers were steadily acquiring land, the effect of enclosure was not so revolutionary as is sometimes supposed. One hundred and nine parishes have been grouped according to the date of their complete enclosure, and the course of poor releif expenditure traced in each group. It is seen that, despite the large acreage converted to pasture in Leicestershire, enclosure was not one of the main causes of the great increases in the sums spent on the poor during the period under consideration. The widely differing circumstances of each parish, however, indivate the danger of broad generalisation in this field...|$|R
40|$|The report {{deals with}} a brief {{description}} of the EU SILC (European Union – Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) <b>statistical</b> <b>enquiry,</b> which is pursued by the Czech Statistical Office accordingly to the European Union methodical instructions. The survey sampling proceeds in order to coordinate the methodical procedures in all EU countries according to the Regulation (EC) 1177 / 2003; and in the long term, it is meant to acquire the data on the income and social situation of inhabitants. The survey enables to obtain the representative data on the particular types of households income distributions, the way, quality and financial claims of living, the household equipment of things for long-time usage. Every year the survey is extended by the households living conditions modulus. The object of the paper concerns the delimitation of Czech households income levels in the years of 2005 – 2008 with the basic income characteristics quantification. The primary data of EU SILC survey conducted in the years of 2005 – 2008 were used for the income and income differentiation analysis. The Czech economics development after the period of transformation refers to a low income differentiation, therefore the basic methodical tools of income differentiation (Gini coefficient, income deciles analysis, Theil index, Robin Hood index) will be used to prove such a matter of fact. The attention will be paid to the delimitation of the main factors influencing the income differentiation. The poverty and households endangered by poverty present a frequent topic of proffesional and laic discussions. The basic tools for the poverty level determination will be applicated in the paper, as well as the low income group analysis in particular years with the principal characteristics delimitation. The typical sign of a low income group presents social security benefits, whose structure will be introduced in the paper. At the close, we will approach to the EU SILC survey results comparison in the particular member states with the emphasis on their risk of poverty level...|$|R
