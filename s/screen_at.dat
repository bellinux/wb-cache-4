5|$|There {{are three}} types of {{coloured}} insect, and {{three types of}} pesticide, which will either kill, stun, or {{have no effect on}} the insects. The player can only carry one type of pesticide at a time; during {{the early stages of the}} game the lethal pesticide can be carried at all times, but later stages have more than one type of insect on <b>screen</b> <b>at</b> once, making the choice of pesticide more tactical.|$|E
5|$|A further {{challenge}} for the dog actor was to lie still in an isolation tank and not move even when petted by Bakula or Billingsley during some long scenes whilst on <b>screen.</b> <b>At</b> times a stunt dog was used, but Breezy was required for any close-ups. A prosthetic Beagle was also created for the scenes in the isolation tank and to be submersed in a super-hydration tank. The prop was created by Joel Harlow, who had also created make-up designs for the television series Carnivàle and the film The Chronicles of Riddick.|$|E

5|$|As {{reflector}} sight designs advanced after World War II, {{giving the}} pilot {{more and more}} information, they eventually evolved into the head-up display (HUD). The illuminated reticle was eventually replaced by a video <b>screen</b> <b>at</b> {{the focus of the}} collimating optics that not only gave a sighting point and information from a lead-finding computer and radar, but also various aircraft indicators (such as an artificial horizon, compass, altitude and airspeed indicators), facilitating the visual tracking of targets or the transition from instrument to visual methods during landings.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} that the player controlled would change as they progressed through the game. The creators sought {{to have the}} player control Spock {{during one of the}} Vulcan's mind melds. The ending of the game would have seen the player control Kirk, Spock and Chekov in an attempt to stop the titular superweapon. The interface for the game revolved around a menu which appears after the mouse button is held down while the cursor is hovering over an object. This was to prevent the need for controls to be shown on <b>screen</b> <b>at</b> all times, {{in a manner similar to}} LucasArts games of that period.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shown out of {{competition}} at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival and was well received by audiences and critics. The film was then given an exclusive run in Los Angeles, where it took a combined $83,513, and New York City, where it made $132,294 on three screens in its opening weekend. The film was then released in 42 theaters where it earned $645,363 on its opening weekend.

The video features both singers, and begins with Houston and Carey performing in a large auditorium, giving {{the illusion of a}} concert. Towards the end of the video, clips of the film are projected onto a large <b>screen</b> <b>at</b> the concert, while they belt out the final verse. The alternate video was only released on NBC's special, When You Believe: Music Inspired by the Prince of Egypt, broadcast on December 13, 1998. It features a similar synopsis, with both singers performing on a large stage of an old Egyptian pyramid.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} smaller {{architectural}} works within cathedrals {{which have the}} curvilinear tracery. These include the arcading in the Lady Chapel at Ely, which also has the widest vault in England, the pulpitum <b>screen</b> <b>at</b> Lincoln and richly decorated doorways at Ely and Rochester. Characteristic of this period of Gothic is elaborate lierne vaulting in which the main ribs are connected by intermediate ribs which do not spring {{from the wall and}} so are not major structural members. The vaults of Bristol are the most famous examples of this style, which can also be seen at York.|$|E
5|$|This {{original}} {{version of the}} video begins at a hill where the band are playing in a quiet town.

This video is shown on a small on-stage television <b>screen</b> <b>at</b> live shows, including the band's 2008 Viva la Vida tour.|$|E
5|$|Andrei Rublev {{was invited}} to the Cannes Film Festival in 1967 {{as part of a}} planned {{retrospective}} of Soviet film on occasion of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. The official answer was that the film was not yet completed and could not be shown at the film festival. A second invitation was made by the organizers of the Cannes Film Festival in 1969. Soviet officials accepted this invitation, but they only allowed the film to <b>screen</b> <b>at</b> the festival out of competition, and it was screened just once at 4 A.M. {{on the final day of}} the festival. Audience response nevertheless was enthusiastic, and the film won the FIPRESCI prize. Soviet officials tried to prevent the official release of the film in France and other countries, but were not successful as the French distributor had legally acquired the rights in 1969.|$|E

5|$|Core Design's Fighting Force (1997) was {{anticipated}} {{to redefine the}} genre for 32-bit consoles through its use of a 3D environment. However, it was met with a lukewarm reception. The Dynasty Warriors series, beginning with Dynasty Warriors 2 in 2000, offered traditional beat 'em up action on large 3D battlefields, displaying dozens of characters on the <b>screen</b> <b>at</b> a time. The series to date spans 14 games (including expansions) which players in the West view as overly similar, although the games' creators claim their large audience in Japan appreciates the subtle differences between the titles. While critics saw Dynasty Warriors 2 as innovative and technically impressive, they held a mixed opinion of later titles. These later games received praise for simple, enjoyable gameplay but were simultaneously derided as overly simplistic and repetitive. Another best-selling Japanese series, Yakuza, combined elaborate plots and detailed interactive environments with street brawling action. Despite these releases, game reviewers started to pronounce that the genre had died off. By 2002, there were virtually no new beat 'em ups being released in arcades.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Cetacean Institute, Taylor's workplace, {{was created}} by using the real-life Monterey Bay Aquarium. A holding tank for the whales was added via special effects to the Aquarium's exterior. For close-ups of the {{characters}} as they watched the whales in the tank, the Aquarium's walls and railings were measured and replicated for a set on the Paramount parking lot. One scene takes place by a large glass through which observers view the whales—and Spock's initiation of a mind meld—underwater. Footage of the actors shot {{in front of them}} as they reacted to a brick wall in the Aquarium was combined with shots taken from their rear as they stood in front of a large blue <b>screen</b> <b>at</b> ILM to produce this scene. The footage of Spock's melding with the whales was shot weeks later in a large water tank used to train astronauts for weightlessness.|$|E
5|$|By August 1967, Baer and Harrison had {{completed}} a third prototype machine, but {{had found that}} to even come near to Baer's initial aim of a US$20 or $25 console would require {{so much to be}} excluded that the resulting console would not be very enjoyable. Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system; to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console, to the project. Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming {{up with a way to}} display three spots on the <b>screen</b> <b>at</b> once rather than the previous two, and proposing the development of a ping pong game. By November the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping pong game. Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it; they had decided to aim for selling the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was not in the business of making and selling commercial electronics.|$|E

5|$|In November 2008, after Sakurai {{was given}} the go-ahead to develop Uprising, he rented out an office in Takadanobaba, a {{district}} of Tokyo. At this stage, due to the game's platform still being in early development, there were no development tools available for Sakurai to use. Between November and March 2009, Sakurai finalized his vision for the game. During this period, to help design the game's settings and characters, Sakurai hired several outside illustrators to work on concept art: these artists were Toshio Noguchi, Akifumi Yamamoto and Masaki Hirooka. The art style was inspired by manga. In January 2009, development studio Project Sora was established for Uprisings development. At its inception, it had a staff of 30. With the start of active recruitment in March 2009, the game officially entered development: at the time, {{it was the very}} first game to be in development for the new platform. During this early stage, {{due to the lack of}} platform specific development tools, the team were developing the game on Wii hardware and personal computers. The changing specifications of the developing hardware resulted in multiple features undergoing major revisions. This hardware instability led to a protracted development cycle: in the event, the team managed to fully utilize the platform's capabilities, doing detailed work on how many enemies they could show on the <b>screen</b> <b>at</b> any one time. Debugging also took a long time due to the size and variability of gameplay built into Uprising.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Final Fantasy VII {{is mostly}} comparable to earlier Final Fantasy titles and Japanese role-playing games. The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, {{and the battle}} <b>screen.</b> <b>At</b> its grandest scale, players explore the entire world of Final Fantasy VII on a 3D world map. The world map is littered with representations of areas for the player to enter, including towns, environments, and ruins. Natural barrierssuch as mountains, deserts, and bodies of waterblock access by foot to some areas; as the game progresses, the player receives vehicles that help traverse these obstacles. Chocobos {{can be found in}} certain spots on the map, and if caught, can be ridden to areas inaccessible by foot or vehicle. In field mode, the player navigates fully scaled versions of the areas represented on the world map. For {{the first time in the}} Final Fantasy series, this mode is represented in three-dimensional space. The player can explore the environment, talk with characters, advance the story, and initiate event games in this mode. Event games are short minigames that use special control functions and are often tied into the story. While in field mode, the player may also find shops and inns. Shops provide an opportunity to buy and sell items that can aid Cloud and his party, such as weapons, armor, and accessories. If the characters rest at an inn, their hit points and mana points will be completely restored, along with any abnormalities contracted during battles.|$|E
