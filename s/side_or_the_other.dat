5|$|A {{forward is}} a player {{position}} on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive. Typically, a forward is dominant throwing with one hand or the other, and will primarily play {{on that side of}} the floor. Some players, known as creasemen, do not focus on one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender.|$|E
5|$|Before {{reaching}} Italy, Titus learnt that Galba {{had been}} murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of Lusitania (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.|$|E
5|$|Spicer took {{written and}} oral {{testimony}} {{from a number}} of witnesses over more than a month. Accounts by both participants and eye-witnesses were contradictory.

50|$|Little {{attention}} has been paid to the balancing of the interests at stake in derivative work copyright disputes where conflicting interests are present. In the Perfect 10 and Castle Rock cases, however, the courts appeared to have recognized that some conflict existed, but they finessed the balancing task by finding one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other's</b> interest negligible, so that no serious work had to be done in gauging the balance. although several courts have found no copyright infringement for one reason or another. In an analogous area of copyright law, a solution reached was to permit the use challenged as infringement, but to require payment of a reasonable royalty.|$|R

5|$|Bikes may {{experience}} {{a variety of}} longitudinal forces and motions. On most bikes, when the front wheel is turned to one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> the entire rear frame pitches forward slightly, depending on the steering axis angle {{and the amount of}} trail. On bikes with suspensions, either front, rear, or both, trim is used to describe the geometric configuration of the bike, especially in response to forces of braking, accelerating, turning, drive train, and aerodynamic drag.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{dodged the}} issue during the campaign, which he won in 1825, {{but once he}} took office, {{he had to come}} down on one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> He voted in favor of the Old Court, {{reflecting}} his upper-class status and affinity for the establishment. In so doing, he identified himself with the party of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay. The Whigs would control Kentucky politics for the next twenty-five years. In 1826, the majority of the General Assembly sided with the Old Court and abolished the New Court.|$|E
5|$|Even when staying {{relatively}} motionless, a rider can {{balance a}} bike {{by the same}} principle. While performing a track stand, the rider can keep {{the line between the}} two contact patches under the combined center of mass by steering the front wheel to one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> and then moving forward and backward slightly to move the front contact patch from side to side as necessary. Forward motion can be generated simply by pedaling. Backwards motion can be generated the same way on a fixed-gear bicycle. Otherwise, the rider can take advantage of an opportune slope of the pavement or lurch the upper body backwards while the brakes are momentarily engaged.|$|E

5|$|On October 14, the {{retreating}} Patriot force held drumhead courts-martial of Loyalists on various charges (treason, desertion from Patriot militias, incitement of Indian rebellion). Passing through the Sunshine community {{in what is}} now Rutherford County, N.C., the retreat halted on the property of the Biggerstaff family. Aaron Biggerstaff, a Loyalist, had fought in the battle and been mortally wounded. His brother Benjamin was a Patriot and was being held as a prisoner-of-war on a British ship docked at Charleston, S.C. Their cousin John Moore was the Loyalist commander at the earlier Battle of Ramsour's Mill (modern Lincolnton, N.C.), in which many of the combatants at Kings Mountain had participated on one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
5|$|Who started {{shooting}} first is not certain; accounts by both participants and eyewitnesses are contradictory. The {{smoke from the}} black powder used in the weapons added to the confusion of the gunfight in the narrow space. Those loyal to one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> told conflicting stories, and independent eyewitnesses {{who did not know}} the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first. The six or seven men with guns fired about 30 shots in around 30 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The sails {{of these}} vessels {{are made of}} strips of bamboo, woven into the form of matting. The sailors never lower them (while sailing, but simply) change the {{direction}} of them according to whether {{the wind is blowing}} from one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> When the ships cast anchor, the sails are left standing in the wind. Each of these ships is worked by 1,000 men, 600 sailors and 400 marines, among whom there are archers and crossbowmen furnished with shields, and men who throw (pots of) naptha. Each great vessel is followed by three others, a 'nisfi', a 'thoulthi' and a 'roubi' (f endnote: a pinnace, a small boat fitted with a rudder, and a rowing boat). These vessels are nowhere made except in the city of Zayton (Quanzhou) in China, or at Sin-Kilan, which is the same as Sin al-Sin (Guangzhou).|$|E
60|$|The {{sources from}} which {{the history of the}} House of Borgia has been culled are not to be {{examined}} in a preface. They are too numerous, and they require too minute and individual a consideration that their precise value and degree of credibility may be ascertained. Abundantly shall such examination be made {{in the course of this}} history, and in a measure as the need arises to cite evidence for one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> for <b>the</b> <b>other</b> shall that evidence be sifted.|$|R
60|$|Inferences {{unassailable}} as processes, are, nevertheless, to be suspected, {{from the}} almost certain deficiency of particulars on some <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>other.</b> <b>The</b> truth {{in relation to}} Neigh's supposed frigidity was brought before her {{at the end of}} the following week, when Dan and Sol had taken Picotee, Cornelia, and the young children to Kew for the afternoon.|$|R
50|$|The mosque {{occupies}} a rectangular area (50.35 x 50.24 m) and contains an open sahn measuring 11 x 5 square meters. Surrounded by four corridors, the qibla {{can be accessed}} through the main gate located on <b>the</b> south <b>side</b> <b>or</b> through <b>the</b> <b>other</b> doors distributed {{on the walls of}} the mosque, which are open directly to the qibla hallway. It is worth mentioning that the mihrab is not in the middle of the qibla wall. This is due to the repeated additions to the mosque, for example a wooden platform inside the wall to the east of the mihrab, a pulpit dating back to the year 1542.|$|R
5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.|$|E
5|$|On 9 June 68, amidst growing {{opposition}} of the Senate and the army, Nero committed suicide, and with him the Julio-Claudian dynasty came to an end. Chaos ensued, leading to a year of brutal civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors, during which the four most influential generals in the Roman EmpireGalba, Otho, Vitellius and Vespasiansuccessively vied for the imperial power. News of Nero's death reached Vespasian as he was preparing to besiege the city of Jerusalem. Almost simultaneously the Senate had declared Galba, then governor of Hispania Tarraconensis (modern Spain), as Emperor of Rome. Rather than continue his campaign, Vespasian decided to await further orders and send Titus to greet the new Emperor. Before reaching Italy however, Titus learnt that Galba had been murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of Lusitania (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt, and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.|$|E

60|$|During <b>the</b> {{thirty years}} <b>or</b> so during which I {{have been reading}} Irish newspapers, three public controversies have stirred my imagination. The first was the Parnell controversy. There were reasons to justify a man's joining either party, but there were none to justify, on one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> on <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> lying accusations forgetful of past service, a frenzy of detraction. And another was the dispute over 'The Playboy.' There were reasons for {{opposing}} as for supporting that violent, laughing thing, but none for the lies, for the unscrupulous rhetoric spread against it in Ireland, and from Ireland to America. The third prepared for the Corporation's refusal of a building for Sir Hugh Lane's famous collection of pictures.|$|R
60|$|Your Lordships will observe, {{that for}} all these facts there is no evidence, on <b>the</b> one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> on <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> {{directly}} before you. Their merits have been insisted upon, in long and laborious details and discussions, both by Mr. Hastings himself and by his counsel. We have answered them for that reason; but we answer them with a direct reference to records and papers, from which your Lordships may judge of them as set-offs and merits. I believe your Lordships will now hardly receive them as merits to set off guilt, since {{in every one of}} them there is both guilt in the act, and strong ground for presuming that he had corruptly taken money for himself.|$|R

Whatever speed adjustments were possible were made by moving the drive belt among {{a small number of}} pulleys (usually three) of varying diameters.|$|E
50|$|The main {{ingredient}} for Crab Louie, {{as the name}} suggests, is crab meat. The preferred crab is Dungeness Crab, but other crab meat can be substituted, including cheaper imitation crab meat.

60|$|These two Heads well settled will fully {{explain the}} Title of this Chapter, answer the Query {{mentioned}} in it, {{and at the}} same time correspond very well with, and give us a farther Prospect into the main and original Design of this Work, namely, The History of the Devil.

The time was ominous: social dissolution near and certain; social renovation still a problem, difficult and distant even though sure. But if ominous to some clearest onlooker, whose faith stood not with one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> with <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> nor in <b>the</b> ever-vexed jarring of Greek with Greek at all,--how unspeakably ominous to dim Royalist participators; for whom Royalism was Mankind's palladium; for whom, with the abolition of Most-Christian Kingship and Most-Talleyrand Bishopship, all loyal obedience, all religious faith was to expire, and final Night envelope the Destinies of Man! On serious hearts, of that persuasion, the matter sinks down deep; prompting, as we have seen, to backstairs Plots, to Emigration with pledge of war, to Monarchic Clubs; nay to still madder things.|$|R
60|$|Those {{who have}} gone before me in writing the life of Cicero have, in telling their story as to Milo, very {{properly}} gone to Asconius for their details.

Among other writings he could refer to those books of Livy which have since been lost. He seems to have done his work as commentator with no glow of affection and with no touch of animosity, either on one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> on <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> There can be no reason for doubting the impartiality of Asconius as to Milo's trial, and every reason for trusting {{his knowledge of the}} facts.|$|R
