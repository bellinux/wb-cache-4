50|$|As {{long as the}} hot-swap {{connector}} {{is sufficiently}} rigid, {{one of the four}} corner pins will always be the first to engage. For a typical two-row connector arrangement this provides four first-to-make corner pins that are usually used for grounds. Other pins near the corners can be used for functions that would also benefit from this effect, for example sensing when the connector is fully <b>seated.</b> This <b>diagram</b> illustrates good practice where the grounds are in the corners and the power pins are near the center. Two sense pins are located in opposite corners so that fully seated detection is confirmed only when both of them are in contact with the slot. The remaining pins are used for all the other data signals.|$|R
25|$|In 2003, {{with the}} general {{run-down}} of slam door trains, {{it was decided to}} reform some of the 4Vop units by swapping one driving trailer with that from a standard unit. The new hybrid units were reclassified as Class 423/8 (or 4Vip) and renumbered in the range 3813-3844. This was to give all units some 1st-class <b>seating,</b> thus making <b>diagramming</b> of units easier. But in the event only eight units were reformed, namely nos. 3813/14/21/22/41-44.|$|R

The display includes benches and <b>seating,</b> charts and <b>diagrams,</b> as well as teaching tools such as abacuses and blackboards, all contemporary of the time. This display is designed to give people (young people in particular) an idea of what education would have been like in 19th century compared with now. The Museum currently runs activities based on this exhibit for schools.|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} seating arrangement for a studio orchestra. Considerations and favourable aspects will be discussed. As an example, details {{will be given}} for the Metropole Orkest (studio orchestra of the Netherlands public radio and television, spe-cialised in jazz, popular and film music). Concert visitors, unfamiliar with the working principles of a large studio orchestra, might benefit from these notes. 1 <b>Seating</b> arrangement The <b>diagram</b> in Fig. 1 shows the seating arrangement for a medium to large studio orchestra, such as the Metropole Orchestra. The seating plan is quite {{similar to that of}} a symphony or-chestra, with the strings in front, winds and brass in the centre and percussion {{in the rear of the}} sound stage. We will consider a medium to large orchestra with approximately 50 musicians, see the Metropole Orkest overview in Fig. 2. In such a studio orchestra there is a number of instrument groups: Rhythm section: The repertoire of the studio orchestra consists of jazz, popular and film mu-sic. Much of that music requires a strong rhythm section, maintaining the correct tem-pos (indicated by the conductor) and creating a groove. The tandem of drummer and bass player (on both acoustic bass and bass guitar) is the rhythm engine of the orchestra. There-fore it makes sense to put these in the centre. Other members of the rhythm section are the guitar player (on both rhythm and solo guitar, acoustic and electric) and the piano and keyboard player. Big band: The big band contains the rhythm section plus saxophones, trombones and trum-pets. Currently, there are 5 saxophones (alto 1 and 2, tenor 1 and 2, and baritone saxo-phone; in the studio orchestra they will double on clarinet and flute), 4 trombones (the 4 th chair will play bass trombone and double on tuba; all trombone players may double on baritone or euphonium) and 4 trumpets (doubling on flugelhorn). Each group has a leader on first chair. The brass first chair frequently is the high blower (specialised in controlled and sustained production of high pitches), while the second chair takes most improvised solos. See the brass and saxophone groups in Fig. 3 and 4...|$|R
