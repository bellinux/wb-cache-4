Various microstructures are obtained using postbrazing heat treatments developed to enhance the corrosion resistance of an AA 4 xxx/AA 3 xxx brazing sheet.

Additionally, the effect of the heat treatment on the local electrochemical activity and corrosion properties are studied. The results indicate that the corrosion susceptibility of the as-brazed structure is diminished resulting from of an amendment of the local electrochemical behavior of the outer clad surface after the post-brazing heat treatment.

Two types of zinc powder, exhibiting spherical and flake particle morphologies, are dispersed in an ethanolic solution of polyvinyl butyral. The resulting dispersions are cast onto glass to produce self-supporting zinc-rich organic films. The same dispersions are cast onto an iron substrate to form strongly adherent zinc-rich organic coatings.

Polarization experiments on a rotating disk electrode provide system parameters, i. e., the exchange current density and the cathodic transfer coefficient, which confirm that PEG suppresses the zinc electrodeposition kinetics.

Constructing embankments to survive the cyclonic wet season from material highly susceptible to erosion, is a major challenge.

The core catcher system consists of a carbon steel body, <b>sacrificial</b> material, <b>protection</b> material and engineered cooling channel.

The distorted streamline could affect the overall thermal-hydraulic performance including two-phase heat transfer coefficient and critical heat flux (CHF) of the system. Thus, it is of importance to investigate the thermal-hydraulic effects of studs on the coolability, especially the CHF of the core catcher system. With aforementioned importance, pool boiling experiments were carried out with stud shape of, rectangular, cylinder, and elliptic and for stud sizes of 10, 15, 20, and 25 mm under the condition of atmospheric saturated water. A particular attention was focused on observing local vapor behavior around the studs and finding any hot spots, where the vapors are accumulated. The occurrence of the CHF is anticipated at {{the back side of}} the studs. The visual observation and CHF measurements indicate that the effect of studs on the performance of boiling heat transfer is significant. In this work, an experimental study has been conducted to investigate the effects of stud shape and size on the pool boiling CHF of saturated water under the atmospheric pressure. The major conclusions from this study are summarized as follows. (1). The experimental result confirmed that the installation of the stud influenced the CHF value due thermal-hydraulic restriction. With the presence of studs, the CHF value was measured lower than the bare specimen up and the reduction ranged from 18 % to 55 % depending on the stud shape and size. (2). It was observed that CHF data generally decreases as the stud size becomes larger. Especially, when the size of the studs was 25 mm, the CHF value drastically decreased in all studs&# 39; shapeThis work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (MSIP) with grant number, 2014 M 2 B 2 A 9032081...|$|R
