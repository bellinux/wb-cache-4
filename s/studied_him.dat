25|$|Ginsberg's main Romantic {{influence}} was William Blake, and <b>studied</b> <b>him</b> throughout his life. Blake {{was the subject}} of Ginsberg's self-defining auditory hallucination and revelation in 1948. The first time Michael McClure met Ginsberg, they talked about Blake: McClure saw him as a revolutionary, while Ginsberg saw him as a prophet. Romantic poet John Keats was also cited as an influence.|$|E
500|$|... "Like most people, I {{had heard}} of Gandhi, but I had never <b>studied</b> <b>him</b> seriously. As I read I became deeply fascinated by his campaigns of nonviolent resistance. I was {{particularly}} moved by his Salt March to the Sea and his numerous fasts. The whole concept of Satyagraha (Satya is truth which equals love, and agraha is force; Satyagraha, therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant to me. As I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see {{for the first time}} its potency in the area of social reform." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite his unusual {{diet and}} {{behaviour}} {{in the presence}} of food, doctors described Domery as of a normal build, and tall for the period at [...] He had long, brown hair and grey eyes, was smooth-skinned, and was described as having a [...] "pleasant countenance". Doctors observing Domery saw no signs of mental illness and although illiterate, he was considered of normal intelligence by his crewmates and by the prison doctors who <b>studied</b> <b>him.</b> Despite eating vast amounts of food, it was noted by the doctors studying him that he never vomited, other than when fed large amounts of roasted or boiled meat. He showed no outward signs of ill health, and doctors observing him noted that his eyes were lively and his tongue clean. His pulse was regular at around 84BPM, and his body temperature normal. His muscles were normally formed, but observed by doctors to be weaker than usual, although during his time in the army he had marched 14French leagues (approximately 25mi/42km) in a day with no ill effects.|$|E
2500|$|Studies were {{completed}} consistently throughout Molaison's lifetime to discover more about amnesia. Researchers did a 14-year follow-up study on Molaison. [...] They <b>studied</b> <b>him</b> {{for a period}} of two weeks to learn more about his amnesia. After 14 years, Molaison still could not recall things that had happened since his surgery. However, he could still remember things that had happened prior to the operation. Researchers also found that, when asked, Molaison could answer questions about national or international events, but he could not remember his own personal memories. [...] After his death Molaison donated his brain to science, where they were able to discover the areas of the brain that had the lesions which caused his amnesia. This case study provided important insight to the areas of the brain that are affected in anterograde amnesia, as well as how amnesia works.|$|E
2500|$|The {{comfortable}} {{lifestyle and}} fortune that Lilly inherited from Ellen, gave him leisure time to frequent sermons and lectures in London society. In 1632, shortly before Ellen's death, {{he began to}} study astrology, reading all the {{books on the subject}} he could fall in with, and occasionally trying his hand at unravelling mysteries by means of his art. The years 1642 and 1643 were devoted to a careful revision of all his previous reading, and in particular, having lighted on Valentine Naibod's Commentary on Alcabitius, he [...] "seriously <b>studied</b> <b>him</b> and found him to be the profoundest author he ever met with." [...] About the same time he tells us that he “did carefully take notice of every grandaction betwixt king and parliament, and did first then incline to believe that as all sublunary affairs depend on superior causes, so there, was: a possibility of discovering them by the configurations of the superior bodies." [...] And, having thereupon [...] "made some essays," [...] he [...] "found encouragement to proceed further, and ultimately framed to himself that method which he ever afterwards followed." ...|$|E

2500|$|I made a {{whole series}} of studies to prepare this portrait. Drawings and washes in china ink. I {{analysed}} the architecture of the head in monumentally sized enlargements, two or three times the natural size, I made a certain number of drawings of the hands, I studied the organisation and the overall effect, volumes and the relations of the formal elements between themselves. Finally, I reduced the colour to a harmony of blacks and greys supported by some flashes of light red which set up a contrast, at once breaking with and supporting the interplay of harmonious colour relations. Nayral came regularly to the studio, I worked directly on him, naturally, {{but more often than not}} the work consisted in friendly conversation, in walks in the garden, during which I <b>studied</b> <b>him,</b> watching what was his natural way of walking and what were his usual gestures, above all arming my memory with essential characteristics, trying to isolate his true likeness from the accumulation of details and picturesque superfluities which always interfere with the permanent reality of a being. The portrait was executed without turning to the model, it was finished some weeks before the Automne and I decided to show it... if the jury would be willing to accept it, as I was not yet a member.

6000|$|... "You don't look irrational, but you act so," [...] she said, <b>studying</b> <b>him</b> more closely. The {{hand that}} had been pressed to her breast dropped down.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} {{they were}} <b>studying</b> <b>him,</b> and it struck {{them that he}} looked ill. His face was flabby and there were heavy pouches under his eyes.|$|R
60|$|During the {{conversation}} Harding had been <b>studying</b> <b>him</b> closely. The well-bred reserve in his manner, which, while peremptory, was somehow free from arrogance, compelled the man's admiration.|$|R
