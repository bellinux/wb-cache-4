40|$|For an N players {{coordination}} games, Tanaka (2000) {{proved that}} the notion of N/ 2 stability defined by Schaffer (1988) is a necessary and sufficient condition for long run equilibrium in an evolutionary process with mutations (in the sense of Kandori, et. al. (1993)). We argue that the critical number in Schaffer's stability is not unique in every application, but can vary with variables determined before the coordination games. In our specific model, these variables are the portfolio choices of the banks. We derived a Z* stability condition for the long run equilibrium for the banking system, {{in which there is no}} speculative bank run. This critical number of players is a function of the size for risky investment, and varies with total risky investments when there are more than two banks. We use this framework to analyze the effect of speculative behavior on banks' risk taking and the phenomenon of system risk, calculating the probability when more than one bank fail together (system risk). Our specific results include: first, we propose a Z* stability condition, which is proved to be a necessary and sufficient condition for such a long run equilibrium in the sense of KMR. This critical number of Z* is a function of the total risky investment in the banking system. In the case with two banks, this value could vary across banks. Second, speculative behaviors do not frustrate single bank's risky taking, but rather, encourage the bank to maintain a high enough level of risky investment, to keep the system stay in the equilibrium of no run. This indicates that although the <b>speculative</b> <b>run</b> equilibrium will be eliminated in the long run, the probability of fundamental run will increase with the mere possibility of speculative behavior. It is well known that sufficiently large exogenous shocks can cause a crisis. For example, Allen and Gale (1998) describe a model in which financial crises are caused by exogenous asset-return shocks. Following a large (negative) shock to asset returns, banks are unable to meet their commitments and are forced to default and liquidate assets. Third, the single bank case does not necessarily apply to the case with multiple banks. Symmetric banks can take different level of risks, which induces a different in the probability of bank failures. The probability of joint failures increases, compare to the case without speculation, but the individual probability of bank failures do not necessarily increase. <b>speculative</b> <b>run,</b> evolution process, random mutations, portfolio management, system risk, equilibrium selection, long run stability...|$|E

To improve resource utilization, we propose resource stealing to enable running tasks to steal resources reserved for idle slots and give them back proportionally whenever new tasks are assigned. Resource stealing makes the otherwise wasted resources get fully utilized without interfering with normal job scheduling. MapReduce uses speculative execution to improve fault tolerance.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} examine equilibrium refinements in {{static and}} dynamic binary choice games of complete information with strategic complementarities known as “entry” games. Examples include <b>speculative</b> attacks, bank <b>runs</b> and refinancing decisions by multiple lenders. We explore behavior when {{the value of}} a payoff relevant state variable is known to all players in advance of making their action choices. Such games give rise to multiple equilibria and coordination problems. Our specific aim is to assess the predictive power of two different equilibrium selection principles. In static entry games, we test the theory of global games as an equilibrium selection device. This theory posits that players play games of complete information as if they were playing a related global game of incomplete information. In dynamic entry games, individuals decide not only whether to enter but also when to enter. Once entry occurs it is irreversible. The {{number of people who have}} already entered is part of the state description, and individuals can condition their decisions on that information. If the state variable does not indicate that entry is dominated, the efficient subgame perfect equilibrium prediction calls for all players to immediately choose to enter, thereby resolving the coordination problem. This subgame perfect entry threshold in the dynamic game will generically differ from the global game threshold in static versions of the same entry game. Nevertheless, our experimental findings suggest that entry thresholds i...|$|R
40|$|Data {{prefetching}} effectively {{reduces the}} negative effects of long load latencies on the performance of modern processors. Hardware prefetchers employ hardware structures to predict future memory addresses based on previous patterns. Thread-based prefetchers use portions of the actual program code to determine future load addresses for prefetching. This paper proposes the use of a pointer cache, which tracks pointer transitions, to aid prefetching. The pointer cache provides, for a given pointer's effective address, the base address of the object pointed to by the pointer. We examine using the pointer cache in a wide issue superscalar processor as a value predictor and to aid prefetching when a chain of pointers is being traversed. When a load misses in the L 1 cache, but hits in the pointer cache, the first two cache blocks of the pointed to object are prefetched. In addition, the load's dependencies are broken by using the pointer cache hit as a value prediction. We also examine using the pointer cache to allow <b>speculative</b> precomputation to <b>run</b> farther ahead of the main thread of execution than in prior studies. Previously proposed thread-based prefetchers are limited in how far they can run ahead of the main thread when traversing a chain of recurrent dependent loads. When combined with the pointer cache, a speculative thread can make better progress ahead of the main thread, rapidly traversing data structures in the face of cache misses caused by pointer transitions...|$|R

All who have seen the world have experienced the manner in which our intellectual existences, as it might be, expand; but no one, who has not experienced it, can tell the deep, heartfelt satisfaction there is, in receiving this enlargement of the moral creature, in close association with those we love most on earth. The manner in which Lucy enjoyed all she saw and learned, on our first visit to the other hemisphere; her youngest child--all four of our children were born within the first eight years of our marriage--her youngest child was then long past its infancy, and she had leisure to enjoy herself, in increasing the happiness of her offspring.

This is the country of action, not of thought, or speculation. Men follow out their facts to results, instead of reasoning them out.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{adaptation}} of the Chamley-Gale endogenous-timing information-revelation model of investment (Econometrica 1994). It models a game with pure informational externality where agents can learn by observing others' actions. The social learning can result in herding and possibly in an inefficient cascade. While Chamley and Gale characterize the equilibrium of such a game, this paper permits the derivation of comparative static results of the likelihood of inefficient cascades. This is useful for two reasons: First, the derivation of comparative static results in a model with endogenous timing provides a framework that {{may be useful in}} the analysis {{of a wide variety of}} applied issues. It is often argued that information cascades may help to explain a wide variety of economic issues including business cycles, bank <b>runs,</b> <b>speculative</b> attacks and IPO underpricing among others. However, it has proven difficult to move beyond the demonstration that herding may help explain these phenomena to analyze the welfare implications and policy tools available to decrease the likelihood of inefficient herding in these markets. This paper develops a framework that may be useful in providing a first pass in the analysis of these issues. Secondly, the analysis allows a deeper understanding of the relationship between exogenous and endogenous timing herding models. With endogenous timing the discount rate plays an important role in the determination of the probability of an inefficient cascade. This paper shows that as agents become more patient the probability of an inefficient negative cascade goes up. The relevant time for this discounting is the time to react to the decisions of others. Hence financial markets where agents can react quickly to the observed actions of others are likely to have relatively more inefficient negative cascades (inefficient collapses) than in real investment markets where agents observe and react to the actions of others with a longer delayHerding, Information cascade, Social Learning...|$|R
