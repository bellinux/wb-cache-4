The Ostrogoths eventually reached the lower Danube shores.|$|E
5|$|Eureka {{has been}} read in many ways, {{in part because}} Poe's sincerity in the work is questionable.

In 2012, its revenues grew 40 percent over the preceding year. The following June, ExactTarget was acquired by salesforce.com for $2.5 billion. A few months later, salesforce.com <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> laying off 200 staff due to overlaps after the ExactTarget acquisition. That September at the ExactTarget Connections conference, salesforce.com <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> integrating ExactTarget into a new division called Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, Penn National Gaming bought Rosecroft for $10.25 million. Penn National said it {{planned to}} return live racing and {{simulcast}} wagering {{to the track}} as well as pushing for changes in Maryland gaming laws allowing slots and table games. Penn National <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> hoping to convince the state to allow slot machines at the track, even though voters did not approve Prince George's County as a gambling location. On July 28, 2011, the Maryland Racing Commission agreed to allow Penn National Gaming to secure a $1.4 million line of credit to cover operating losses at Rosecroft for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. Penn National <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> likely to incur $2.3 million in losses through 2013.|$|E

5|$|A {{controversial}} fumble recovery by Sewanee {{may have}} saved the game. Auburn quarterback Reynolds Tichenor <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a gift; the referee awarded Sewanee the ball, but he insisted Auburn recovered it. A double pass play to Warbler Wilson got the ensuing Sewanee touchdown. Bart Sims made the extra point to edge Auburn. Neither team managed to score in the second half. The delay from the crowd gathering on the field ran the game into darkness.|$|E

After THQ closed both studios, the game was cancelled.

5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot.

While this was a legitimate interest, the judge <b>said,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E

On March 19, 1997, the Chicago City Council adopted the Domestic Partners Ordinance, which made employee benefits available to same-sex partners of City employees.

(Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing.|$|E

Others noted that aspects of the multiplayer interface were insufficient, such as the inability to store custom dialog, requiring the Storyteller to type text in real time during gameplay.|$|E
