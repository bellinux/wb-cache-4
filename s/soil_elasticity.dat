However, increasing (Ef/Es) to 5 in a trench width of six times the pipe diameter resulted in a reduction in the pipe deformation up to about 60  %.

This response {{is a result of the}} better confinement provided to the sides of the pipe with filling material that is stiffer than the natural soil surrounding the trench. These results confirm that flexible pipes mainly derive their ability to resist loads from the lateral pressure of the soil along the sides of the pipes.|$|E

The control of different geotechnical phenomena such sliding, and overturning and settlement of the clayey dams has high research priority from which a strong controlling tool obtains for engineers and managers. In this article, the dynamic or seismic deformation of embankments is investigated by finite element modeling in ANSYS software. The Young modules ratio of models {{was defined as the}} crest elasticity modules relative to the soft <b>soil</b> <b>elasticity</b> modules of the foundation.

40|$|The {{study of}} earth masses {{requires}} numerical methods {{that provide the}} quantification of the safety factor without requiring detrimental assumptions. For that, equilibrium analysis can perform fast computations but require assumptions that limit its potentiality. Limit analysis does not require detrimental assumptions but are numerically demanding. This work provides a new approach that combines the advantage of both the equilibrium method and the limit analysis. The defined hybrid model allows probabilistic analysis and optimization approaches without the assumption of interslice forces. It is compared with a published case and used to perform probabilistic studies in both a homogeneous and a layered foundation.

30|$|In this paper, the {{analysis}} of a numerical study of pile–soil interaction subjected to axial and lateral loads is presented. An analysis of the composite pile–soil system was performed using the finite difference (FD) software LPILE. Two three dimensional, finite element (FE) models of pile–soil interaction have been developed using Abaqus/Cae and SAP 2000 to study the effect of lateral loading on pile embedded in clay. A lateral displacement of 2  cm {{was applied to the}} top of the pile, which is embedded into the concrete pile cap, while maintaining a zero slope in a guided fixation. A comparison between the bending moments and lateral displacements along the depth of the pile obtained from the FD solutions and FE was performed. A parametric study was conducted to study the effect of crucial design parameters such as the <b>soil’s</b> modulus of <b>elasticity,</b> radius of the soil surrounding the pile in Abaqus/Cae, and the number of springs in SAP 2000. A close correlation is found between the results obtained by the FE models and the FD solution. The results indicated that increasing the amount of clay surrounding the piles reduces the induced bending moments and lateral displacements in the piles and hence increases its capacity to resist lateral loading.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{structural}} strength of soils {{has been extensively}} described by physical and mechanical properties evaluated on the mesoscale for different soils and management conditions. However, changes {{in the organization of}} the soil matrix at the microstructural level, which can be obtained by rheometry, are still seldom used in soil mechanics. Our aim was to use the amplitude sweep test, a rheometry technique, to investigate the micro{{structural strength}} of four subtropical soils (two Oxisols, an Ultisol and a Vertisol) and to discuss difficulties with respect to the samples, water content, soil density and vertical force. The various rheological properties which reveal the soil microstructural strength were determined: deformation {{at the end of the}} linear viscoelastic range, LVE range (γLVE), shear stress at the end of the LVE range (τLVE), deformation at yield point, YP (γYP), storage and loss moduli at YP (G′G″YP), maximum shear stress (τmax), and integral z. In general, <b>soil</b> <b>elasticity</b> (γLVE and γYP) and microstructural strength (τLVE and τmax) were greater in the Oxisols and the Vertisol, which both possess high clay content, while the latter also contains expansive clay minerals. The lowest structural strength was observed in the Ultisol which had a high sand content. As rheological properties are related to soil properties such as particle size distribution and carbon content, they can be applied in the evaluation of the microstructural strength of clayey and sandy soils and allows for inferences regarding inter-particle shear strength. However, the test is not applicable to very dry soil samples and sample preparations can affect the results. We suggest a number of approaches to find solutions for these difficulties/problems...|$|E
40|$|A steel {{monopile}} is {{the most}} common foundation type of a wind turbine installed offshore and is driven into place with the help of vibratory or impact hammers. Underwater noise generated during the installation of steel monopiles has recently received considerable attention from international environmental organizations and regulatory bodies in various nations. Collected data regarding underwater noise measurements indicate that pile driving operations, especially when impact hammers are used, can be potentially harmful for the marine ecosystem. In this paper, a linear semi-analytical model is developed {{for the study of the}} vibroacoustic behaviour of a coupled pile-soil-water system. The hammer is substituted by an external force applied at the head of the pile. The pile is described by a thin shell theory, whereas both soil and water are modelled as threedimensional continua. The solution is based on the dynamic sub-structuring technique. The total system is divided into two subsystems namely, the shell structure and the soil-fluid medium. The response of each sub-domain is expressed as a summation over a complete set of eigenfunctions. The orthogonality of the shell modes in vacuo and the bi-orthogonality of the acoustoelastic modes is utilized in order to meet the displacement compatibility and the force equilibrium at the interface of the two sub-systems. With the developed model, the wave radiation due to vibratory and impact pile driving is analysed. The influence of <b>soil</b> <b>elasticity</b> and soil stratification on the dynamics of the coupled system is examined. In addition, the energy launched by the hammer into the water and into the soil is investigated for both excitation types in order to highlight the main differences in the generated wave field.

The {{origin of}} the railway systems is {{considerably}} old. In very old times, {{it is known that}} people were carrying heavy freights by the similar way in concept to railway transportation. From history to present day, there have been significant improvements in the rail system. With the industrial revolution and the appearance of motor vehicles together with the rapid population growth, the need of railway transportation gradually increased and that demands resulted in modern railway establishment. Today, maglev trains have been exceeded 500 km/h speed but this type of railway transportation is not in public use yet. Only one line of maglev train in China known in service carrying passengers with high-speed (maximum velocity is 430 km/h).   On the other hand, conventional rapid trains recently have reached over 300 km/h velocity. These rapid trains nowadays have significant share of transportation in the world. Thanks to all these developments, the railway transportation has been taking more important place in human life. To fulfill the increased demands, many types of railway systems have been implementing and more passengers have been benefiting from railway transportation day by day. Therefore, to provide a secure and comfortable transportation system concurrently with favorable cost, railway track design becomes more prominent. In this study, 2 nd chapter explains conventional railway and the layers of the railway track by giving technical properties. The layers that form the track superstructure are the formation, sub-ballast, ballast, geotextile, frost protection layer. Since the topic of this study is a ballastless track design, sub-ballast and ballast layers are not explained here. Add to this, brief information about sub-base soil condition is given. Besides, according to UIC Code, formation layer thickness has been shown by table depending on the different types of soil quality class.   Types of slab track systems used worldwide and their cross-section properties are also briefly shown together with figures of cross section properties. Some of these balastless tracks have been examined more detailed and their advantages are introduced in general. Lots of different balasstless track systems have been classified in a table and the advantages of ballastless track systems are given in general. In the 3 rd chapter, the components of the cast in-situ slab track system which are rail, fasteners, sleepers and concrete plate or plinth beams are examined and the components of these in worldwide use are classified and introduced. Rail types are described as flange rail, double headed rail and Vignol rail. Technical properties of the rail types briefly given and the specification, features that they should have and information about pros and cons of these elements explained. Rail fasteners systems are described as two types, rigid system fasteners and elastic system fasteners. The features of these types of fasteners are shown together with figures. After that sleepers defined under the titles of wooden, steel, concrete and plastic sleepers. Some types of the sleepers that tried and currently being used in the world explained. In concrete sleeper title, post-stressed and pre-stressed concrete sleepers have been described. In this chapter we also give some information about plinth concrete beam and explain the measures must be taken during its construction stage briefly. In the 4 th chapter, a type of slab track systems LVT has been chosen and explained in more detail. Here we also mentioned about ground born noise and vibration mitigation which has an inspiration to choosing LVT slab track. Some measures that should be taken for special buildings such as hospital and theater are given. Besides this, LVT systems features and advantages are explained. In 5 th chapter, design of railway superstructure with an example of LVT system has been explained. At first, we explain how the wheel loads are transferred from top (rail) to sub-base showing modeling of railway superstructure in figure. Slab track modeling has springs between the layers that form the superstructure. From bottom to top, first springs take place under the rigid concrete slab which represents the <b>soil</b> <b>elasticity.</b> Since we examined LVT system here, second spring is between rigid slab and LVT concrete block so called block pad as explained in chapter 4 and the third spring for modeling takes place under the rail representing rail pad stiffness. This type of modeling can also be seen in figure.   In chapter 5 we also introduce the forces which effect railway superstructure. Forces studied under the titles of vertical forces, horizontal forces, temperature stresses and other forces and technical information about these forces are given. Vertical forces investigated under two titles, static and dynamic vertical forces. As for the horizontal forces, they are shown under two titles either as the forces acting parallel to longitudinally direction of railway superstructure and forces acting perpendicular direction to the railway. In temperature stresses section, the calculation of forces emanating from temperature has been given by equation depending on unit length change and temperature change. Railway roadway design is performed assuming that railway is a beam laid on elastic platform, and therefore, determination of soil type and coefficient of soil stiffness or soil spring value is important. Here in chapter 5, we give information about calculation of coefficient of soil stiffness in light of Winkler and Zimmermann’s equations. For obtain one soil coefficient of stiffness when multi-layer case is subject, Eisenmann’s equivalent layers theory has been used and introduced by the help of a figure and the calculation of this method has been explained. Another coefficient used for superstructure static analyses is dynamic impact factor. Today many types of calculation method developed for taking into consideration of the impact of dynamic forces acting on railway. In this study we used Eisenmann’s equations for the speed until 200 km/h.   5 th chapter also explain the analyses and concrete slab design calculation for LVT system under different vehicle loads. The loads chosen here have been taken from UIC and EN 1991 standards. For freight train maximum speed taken as 100 km/h. As for the passenger train and high-speed train maximum speed taken as 120 km/h and 250 km/h respectively. Load Model 71 from UIC is used for freight train. For passenger and high speed train, type- 2 and type- 3 load model from EN 1991 has been used. It should be kept in mind that there is much more different type of load models depending on vehicle style. For analysis, FEA base computer program SAP 2000 has been preferred. This program allows engineers to model almost every type of structure realistically. To model LVT system in the program, modeling technique of which illustration is given by figure in chapter 5 has been used. Rail pad which take place under the rails at joints and rubber boot and LVT block pad represented by springs. Here LVT concrete block pad and the rubber boot which contains the block thought together and their stiffness combined calculating an equivalent spring coefficient.   Soil condition considered as good and class of the subbase soil taken as QS 3 according to soil classification of UIC Code. In the model soil represented with springs either. Slab area that considered here a bearing beam laid on elastic platform divided into small finite elements for analysis. The analysis results are shown in figures as contours diagram and concrete design has been performed using the longitudinally and transverse moment values. There might be lots of soil types and geometrical properties on the route of railway track. Thus, quite a lot different conditions may be needed to take into account. In this study the chosen part is regarded as an alignment and calculation is performed accordingly. In final section we explained our assessments and thoughts about the results of the study.

This paper aims to evaluate the soil stiffness parameters of the alluvial Taipei soil for tie-back diaphragm wall based on back analysis of case study. The case histories of the Taipei County Administration Centre (TCAC) and NTU Hospital (NTUH) were studied in this paper. The deformation analysis was carried out by available finite element analysis tool using PLAXIS. In the analysis, beam element method together with an elastic perfect plastic soil model was used to design the diaphragm wall and the tieback anchor system. The soil was modelled as Mohr-Coulomb model. According to the basic design, the clay deposits are modelled as undrained behaviour while silty-sand behaves in drained condition. The simulation results show that the maximum horizontal movement occurred at around the bottom of wall. At the final stage of construction, the root mean square deviation (RSMD) between measured and calculated the wall movement was 4 % and 7 % respectively at TCAC and NTUH sites.

An optimum water content is required to provide the best path to enter energy into soil and compact it. A constant value of energy applied to a particular type of soil, at optimum water content, leads to a maximum dry unit weight. The aforementioned parameters (γdmax, wopt) are not unique for various types of soils and vary with the type of soils and the compaction energy. At the present study, an empirical method is presented to estimate the maximum dry unit weight, and the optimum water content of clayey gravel at different compaction energy levels. The study is performed at four different compaction energy levels. Based on the results, it is observed that γdmax and wopt hold a linear relationship with log E. The two quantities, i. e. γdmax and wopt are function of the fine grain (clay) content. Finally, the mathematical models are developed to determine γdmax, wopt of the studied soils regarding two variables, i. e. energy levels and the clay percentage and the spatial surface is presented. A comparison performed on the empirical and predicted values of γdmax and wopt shows high and acceptable accuracy of the equations. Since the clayey gravels(GC) are one of the very common used soils in construction projects, for instance, as priority in the crust or core of embankment dams, using the equations and the figures at the present study, a correct estimation can be made for γdmax and wopt of such soils...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Rheological {{parameters}} {{have been}} used to study the interaction between particles and the structural strength of soils subjected to mechanical stresses, in which soil composition and water content most strongly affect soil resistance to deformation. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of water tension on rheological parameters of soils with different mineralogical, physical, and chemical composition. Surface and subsurface horizons of four Oxisols, two Ultisols, one Alfisol, and one Vertisol were physically and chemically characterized; their rheological parameters were obtained from amplitude sweep tests under oscillatory shear on disturbed soil samples that were saturated and subjected to water tension of 1, 3, 6, and 10 kPa. In these samples, the rheological parameters linear viscoelastic deformation limit (γL), maximum shear stress (τmax), and integral z were determined. By simple regression analysis of the rheological parameters as a function of soil water tension, we observed increased mechanical strength with increasing water tension up to at least 6 kPa, primarily due to increased capillary forces in the <b>soil.</b> However, increased <b>elasticity</b> assessed by γL was not as expressive as the increase in structural rigidity assessed by τmax and integral z. Elastic deformation of the soil (γL) increases with {{the increase in the number}} of bonds among particles, which depend on the clay, total carbon, expansive clay mineral, and cation contents; however, maximum shear resistance (τmax) and structural stiffness (integral z) mainly increase with clay, kaolinite, and oxide content by increasing the strength of interparticle bonds. A decrease in mechanical strength occurs for water tension of 10 kPa (the lowest water content evaluated) in sandy horizons or in horizons with a high proportion of resistant microaggregates (pseudosand), when associated with low bulk density, due to fewer points of contact between soil particles and therefore lower capillary force...|$|R
30|$|In civil {{engineering}} practice, building foundations design involves the best-possible {{estimation of the}} effective mechanical properties, such as <b>soil</b> modulus of <b>elasticity</b> and Poisson ratio, for predicting the final building settlements. In recent studies, {{there has been an}} attempt to relate hydraulic conductivity and other properties of fine soils to changes in soil structure at three different levels, namely, micro-, mini-, and macro-structure. The first considers the small pores among single particles; the second, includes spacing among pores and clots; and the third incorporates macropores, such as cracks, fissures, root voids, and visible pores (Mitchel et al. 1973; Collis and McGown 1974; Reddi and Thangavadivelu 1996). Thus, at the microstructure level, flow occurs through macropores and medium-size features may be unimportant. Nevertheless, meso- and micro-pores flow involves intermolecular forces rising from a particular geometry or from electronic properties of the medium or fluid (Knutson andSelker 1994; Hsu and Masten 2001; McNamara and Luthy 2005; Guo and Chorover 2006). Flow, as other conductive properties of porous materials, becomes dependent {{of the nature of the}} components, geometric layout and internal conductivity. In this context, physisorption is a general phenomenon that occurs whenever an adsorptive liquid or gas is brought into contact with the surface of a solid (the adsorbent), involving forces of the same kind as those responsible for the condensation of vapors (Sing et al. 1985). In addition to the attractive dispersion forces and the short-range repulsive forces, specific molecular interactions (e.g. polarization, field-dipole, field gradient-quadrupole) usually occur, influencing the effective mechanical behavior of the materials. Because of the above, soil structure and its composition, at a microscopic level, are important properties to consider for developing models of mechanical behavior to attempt predicting real behavior. In this context, in the last thirty years a family of powerful theoretical methods have been developed; these models have allowed the interpretation of experimental results and the prediction of many properties of disordered micro- and macroscopic systems with regular and non-regular structures (Sahimi 1994). Among others, percolation theory has played an important role for understanding these systems and their properties. Specifically, problems related to porous media have received particular attention. For instance, bi-phase flow problems have been understood and at least, under some conditions, can be interpreted as a percolation phenomenon. Statistical Physics of disordered systems has as an aim to provide methods such that from macroscopic properties of such systems to derive laws at microscopic level. Alternatively, to deduce microscopic properties from macroscopic information observed via experimental techniques. The fast development of such theories is due to the fact that it seems that there is a relation between microscopic elements and its effects on the macroscopic properties. Most of the works reported in the literature deal with problems of hydraulic and electric conductivity. However, there are conductive properties that could be modeled as the elastic properties. In addition, literature reports on materials with repeated octahedral cells have shown that the finite element method (FEM) can be applied to predict effective elastic properties for porous materials such as metallic foams (Deshpande et al. 2001). Micromechanical models using properties such as grain size distribution, individual behavior or random structures of different kinds of composites have been realized using FEM with good results ((Berbenni et al. 2007; Prahl et al. 2007); Giannopoulos et al. In press). Perhaps, continuum mechanics cannot be applied to the modeling of materials behavior to macroscopic levels, but the single mechanical behavior of materials components could be modeled with this microscopic viewpoint. Thus, a combination of the percolation theory and the finite element method could lead to a useful prediction of the effective mechanical properties of fine soils.|$|R
