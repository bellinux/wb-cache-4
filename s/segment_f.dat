50|$|Breaking ties for root ports. When {{multiple}} paths from {{a bridge}} are least-cost paths, the chosen path uses the neighbor bridge {{with the lower}} bridge ID. The root port is thus the one connecting to the bridge with the lowest bridge ID. For example, in figure 3, if switch 4 was connected to network segment d instead of <b>segment</b> <b>f,</b> there would be two paths of length 2 to the root, one path going through bridge 24 and the other through bridge 92. Because there are two least cost paths, the lower bridge ID (24) would {{be used as the}} tie-breaker in choosing which path to use.|$|E

The question remains regarding the utility of speech analysis for restricted vocabularies such as those used in aviation communications. A part-task experiment was conducted in which participants performed Air Traffic Control read-backs in different workload environments. Participant's subjective workload and the speech qualities of fundamental frequency (F 0) and articulation rate were evaluated. A significant increase in subjective workload rating was found for high workload <b>segments.</b> <b>F</b> 0 {{was found to be}} significantly higher during high workload while articulation rates were found to be significantly slower.
