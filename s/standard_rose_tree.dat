40|$|This is an {{exercise}} in some rather complex recursion on <b>Rose</b> <b>trees</b> and Binary trees. You will implement the mapping (similar to the one described in class) of <b>Rose</b> <b>trees</b> to Binary Trees and the inverse mapping binary <b>trees</b> to <b>rose</b> <b>trees.</b> data <b>Rose</b> a = Node a [Rose a] deriving (Eq,Show) data BTree a = Empty | Fork a (BTree a) (BTree a) deriving (Eq,Show) The mapping is called the natural correspondence between trees and binary trees [1, pp. 332]. Given a <b>rose</b> <b>tree</b> (with arbitrary but finite branching) you construct a binary tree where the left fork for each node in the binary tree is the translation of the leftmost child of the corresponding node in the <b>rose</b> <b>tree</b> and the right fork is the binary tree resulting form translating the right sibling of the node in the translated <b>rose</b> <b>tree.</b> Since root nodes in <b>rose</b> <b>trees</b> have no siblings, the binary trees resulting from the translation always have the form (Fork x t Empty).

[...] In this, {{the man in the}} poem is trying to show his love to his <b>rose</b> <b>tree,</b> but only seems to have the love unrequited, even though he treats the <b>rose</b> <b>tree</b> like royalty. This echoes the idea of [...] "Human Love" [...] as we often want things we can't have, and become infatuated with things, or idealizing them instead of actually loving them.

40|$|Trees are {{important}} datatypes {{that are often}} used in representing structured data such as XML. Though trees are widely used in sequential programming, {{it is hard to}} write efficient parallel programs manipulating trees, because of their irregular and ill-balanced structures. In this paper, we propose a solution based on the skeletal approach. We formalize a set of skeletons (abstracted computational patterns) for <b>rose</b> <b>trees</b> (general trees of arbitrary shapes) based on the theory of Constructive Algorithmics. Our skeletons for <b>rose</b> <b>trees</b> are extensions of those proposed for lists and binary trees. We show that we can implement the skeletons efficiently in parallel, by combining the parallel binary-tree skeletons for which efficient parallel implementations are already known. As far as we are aware, we are the first who have formalized and implemented a set of simple but expressive parallel skeletons for <b>rose</b> <b>trees.</b> Ã“ 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Hierarchical {{structure}} is ubiquitous in data across many domains. There are many hierarchical clustering methods, frequently used by domain experts, which strive to discover this structure. However, {{most of these}} methods limit discoverable hierarchies to those with binary branching structure. This limitation, while computationally convenient, is often undesirable. In this paper we explore a Bayesian hierarchical clustering algorithm that can produce trees with arbitrary branching structure at each node, known as <b>rose</b> <b>trees.</b> We interpret these trees as mixtures over partitions of a data set, and use a computationally efficient, greedy agglomerative algorithm to find the <b>rose</b> <b>trees</b> which have high marginal likelihood given the data. Lastly, we perform experiments which demonstrate that <b>rose</b> <b>trees</b> are better models of data than the typical binary trees returned by other hierarchical clustering algorithms. ...|$|R

5000|$|Antal {{states that}} [...] "The man {{actually}} imprisons his partner who reacts accordingly - to ownership with distrust." [...] Antal also goes further {{to mention the}} frequent {{use of the word}} [...] "my" [...] in the poem, especially when in reference to <b>rose</b> <b>tree.</b> The man lays claim over the <b>rose</b> <b>tree,</b> and though he tends to her every need, seems to get nothing but contempt and jealousy from her. Not only is the <b>rose</b> <b>tree</b> trapped underneath the possessiveness of the man, but another [...] "trap" [...] could be implied according to Antal with [...] "The rose-tree, as a rose bush, hints at the possibility of childbearing." [...] Durant furthers the point of possessiveness when he says, [...] "The keyword is 'I've'. What he affirms is not that he is hers, but that she is his. He is not thinking of his responsibility to her, but of his rights over her, and of her obligations towards him." [...] This interpretation makes it sound as if the man is expecting the woman to bear him children. In a time where women were considered men's property anyway, not only would the woman be possessed by her husband, but her children as well. If the <b>rose</b> <b>tree,</b> or rather the woman, fears that her husband is unfaithful to her, she wouldn't want to trap her children within that environment.|$|R
