50|$|Under Colombian law all {{beneficiaries}} {{of public works}} must pay a land appreciation surcharge proportionate {{to the value of}} the government's investment. Beneficiaries of land improvement districts are also liable for the cost of operations and maintenance (O&M). Operations and maintenance costs are recovered through (i) a fixed water charge (per hectare, per year) and (ii) a variable water charge based on the volume of water delivered for irrigation. The law does not state what proportion of these two charges is to meet O&M costs. Water rates are fixed once a year by HIHAT's Board of Directors before the first planting season starts, at the time of budget preparation. In setting the fixed and volumetric water rates, HIMAT determines the users’ contribution to O&M costs, the government pays the difference. Fixed charges are paid in advance, regardless of land use. Their payment is a pre-requisite for receiving the irrigation service. The volumetric water charges are paid {{at the end of each}} season. The collection rate is generally high. Volumetric payments depend on how much water is actually delivered to the farmers. Rainfall varies markedly, which affects demand for <b>supplementary</b> <b>irrigation</b> water. Total water charges covered only 34.9% O&M costs in 1980 and 28.5% in 1987. Only a few districts, including RUT, approach self-sufficiency for operations and maintenance.|$|E

Maize average yield under rainfed and <b>supplementary</b> <b>irrigation</b> conditions were 0. 78 t/ha (standard deviation of 0. 43 t/ha) and 1. 90 t/ha (standard deviation of 0. 39 t/ha), respectively. <b>Supplementary</b> <b>irrigation</b> with added fertilisation of 14 kg-N/ha during dry spells increased average yields by 185 %. Maize yield was affected by seasonal rainfall and its poor distribution. The average evapotranspiration under rainfed and <b>supplementary</b> <b>irrigation</b> for the three seasons was 574 mm and 640 mm respectively. Nevertheless water use efficiency was significantly greater for <b>supplementary</b> <b>irrigation</b> plots (3. 0 kg mm- 1 ha- 1) than for rainfed plots (1. 3 kg mm- 1 ha- 1). Furthermore, with mean incremental water use efficiency of supplemental irrigation of 13. 7 kg mm- 1 ha- 1, implies that 1 m 3 of irrigation water applied timely can produce ZAR 27. 4 (US $ 3. 4) worth of maize.

From this analysis, a suitable drought-assessing technique was developed and site-specific needs for <b>supplementary</b> <b>irrigation</b> were explored. Results showed that our technique for assessing drought and crop failure corresponded well with farmer observations. The three major causes of crop failure (dry spells, short growing period and “total lack of rain”) which were explicitly listed and ranked by the local farmers were found to match the analyzed data well. The agro-meteorological variables with the most severe consequences were “short growing period” and “total lack of rain”. To prolong the growing period, <b>supplementary</b> <b>irrigation</b> is recommended {{in the month of}} September for three of the stations (Maychew, Mekelle and Adigudom) because: (1) rain frequently stops in early September or late August and crops have no other source of water {{for the rest of the}} growing period; (2) sufficient surface runoff can be harvested in July and August to be stored in farm ponds and used in September; (3) more cultivable land can be irrigated if <b>supplementary</b> <b>irrigation</b> is scheduled only for the month of September; and (4) giving <b>supplementary</b> <b>irrigation</b> in September can cut yield reduction by over 80 % and crop failure by over 50 %, except at Alamata.

30|$|While dairy {{production}} is primarily pasture based {{there is increasing}} use of <b>supplementary</b> feeding and <b>irrigation</b> to reduce the impact of climate and to increase production. In contrast, New Zealand meat {{production is}} primarily produced on un-irrigated pastures with little use of supplements. This enables low cost, year-round outdoor grazing that produces natural, high quality meat products. It also means that production is highly seasonal with significant variation due to the climate (McLeod et al. 2011; Bensemann et al. 2011). Changes in pasture supply, driven by variations in temperature and rainfall {{play an important role}} in supply chain dynamics, affecting price, quality and timing of supply (Bensemann et al. 2011). This is compounded by seasonal and structural overcapacity in the meat processing industry, creating a highly competitive environment for procurement of supply.|$|R

The present study was conducted to evaluate two irrigation scheduling techniques for hydroponic tomato production in Navarra, northern Spain, related to the crop water requirements. The results show that although daily over-irrigation was applied (45. 7 % of drainage), 18 % of the total yield (35 kg m(- 2)) was affected by blossom-end rot problems, due to water stress suffered by the crop. Irrigation scheduling by time clock was not flexible enough to satisfy the varying crop water requirements through the day and during the season. With constant irrigation intervals and volumes, water and fertilisers were wasted during the morning (excessive irrigation) whereas during the afternoon, the plants suffered water stress. Irrigation scheduling by radiation method at a level of 0. 81 MJ m(- 2), with some <b>supplementary</b> time clock <b>irrigation</b> applications during the hours of darkness (in order to keep the growing medium wet), appeared to be a good solution.

40|$|Saline {{groundwater}} {{is often}} found at shallow depth in irrigated areas of arid and semi-arid regions and {{is associated with}} problems of soil salinisation and land degradation. The conventional solution is to maintain a deeper water-table through provision of engineered drainage disposal systems, but the sustainability of such systems is disputed. This shallow groundwater should, however, {{be seen as a}} valuable resource, which can be utilised via capillary rise (i. e. sub-irrigation). In this way, it is possible to meet part of the crop water requirement, even where the groundwater is saline, thus decreasing the need for irrigation water and simultaneously alleviating the problem of disposing of saline drainage effluent. Management of conditions within the root zone can be achieved by means of a controlled drainage system. A series of lysimeter experiments have permitted a detailed investigation of capillary upward flow from a water-table controlled at shallow depth (1. 0  m) under conditions of moderately high (5  mm/day) evaporative demand and with different levels of salinity. Experiments were conducted on a wheat crop grown in a sandy loam soil. Groundwater salinity was held at values from 2 to 8  dS/m while <b>supplementary</b> (deficit) <b>irrigation</b> was applied at the surface with salinity in the range 1 - 4  dS/m. Our experiments show that increased salinity decreased total water uptake by the crop, but in most treatments wheat still extracted 40 % of its requirement from the groundwater, similar to the proportion reported for non-saline conditions. Yield depression was limited to 30 % of maximum when the irrigation water was of relatively good quality (1 and 2  dS/m) even with saline groundwater (up to 6  dS/m). Crop water productivity (grain yield basis) was around 0. 35  kg/m 3 over a wide range of salinity conditions when calculated conventionally on the basis of total water use, but was generally above 1. 0  kg/m 3 if calculated on the basis of irrigation input only.

The public canal irrigation system provides water to farmers who own land within designated areas, {{but it does not}} provide all farmers with adequate water supplies when they need it. Therefore, farmers who can afford it are installing tubewells as a sole or <b>supplementary</b> source of <b>irrigation</b> (Figure 1).

The use of <b>supplementary</b> <b>irrigation</b> further reduced the yield gap.

Improved {{water and}} land {{management}} in the Ethiopian highlands: its impact on downstream stakeholders dependent on the Blue Nile. Intermediate Results Dissemination Workshop held at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 5 - 6 February 2009. Colombo, Sri Lanka: International Water Management Institute (IWMI). With its total area of about 200, 000 square kilometers (km 2), which is 20 % of the country?s land mass, and accommodating 25 % of the population, the Upper Blue Nile Basin (Abbay) {{is one of the}} most important river basins in Ethiopia. About 40 % of agricultural products and 45 % of the surface water of the country are contributed by this basin. However, the characteristic-intensive biophysical variation, rapid population growth, land degradation, climatic fluctuation and resultant low agricultural productivity and poverty are posing daunting challenges to sustainability of agricultural production systems in the basin. This calls for technological interventions that not only enhance productivity and livelihoods in the basin, but also bring about positive spillover effects on downstream water users. In this study, the farming systems in the basin have been stratified and characterized; and promising agricultural water management technologies, which may upgrade the productivity of smallholder rainfed agriculture while improving downstream water quality, have been identified. As a consequence, <b>supplementary</b> and full <b>irrigation</b> using rainwater and drainage of waterlogged soils are recognized as being among the promising agricultural water management technologies that can be easily scaled-up in the basin. The magnitude of the impacts of these technologies on the productivity of the upstream farming systems and the concomitant effects on the downstream water flow and quality are under investigation, assuming an assortment of scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Unpredictable rainstorms {{can pose}} greater risks of soil erosion on newly formed {{unprotected}} railway batters. Bio-engineering approach consisting of revegetation {{can be an}} effective tool for soil erosion control. Perennial species, such as buffel grass, are preferred for durability of vegetation cover in the arid and semi-arid tropics. However, it takes relatively longer time to establish buffel compared with the annual species such as Japanese millet (JM). A replicated plot-scale field trials consisting of different proportions of grass seed mixtures of buffel and JM was conducted on railway batters slope in the semi-arid tropics of central Queensland, Australia. <b>Supplementary</b> automated drip <b>irrigation</b> system was set up to aid seed germination and early establishment of the grass cover. JM alone or JM dominated seed mixtures significantly reduced soil erosion during the earlier stages. For example, during the second sampling interval, which occurred 63 days after seeding, JM alone reduced soil erosion by 50 % (20. 2 vs 10. 21 t/ha) compared with the sole buffel. This trendbegan to shift as the growth of buffel took up at the latter stages. By the end of the 11 months, erosion from all seeded plots was not significantly different from each other with over 90 % soil loss reduction compared to the bare scenario as a result of over 60 % grass cover. Results suggested that a monoculture of JM, or JM dominated seed mixture with buffel grass, could be an effective bioengineering approach for revegetation of railway batters for protection against soil erosion. Quick establishment due to faster seed germination, seedling establishments and growth producing sizable canopy cover developed by JM in early stage of batter could reduce soil erosioncompared to sole crop of slow growing perennial species, buffel. The established vegetation, self regenerated, and responded dynamically and naturally to changing conditions of the railway batter within a year, after which JM started to die back...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, {{agricultural}} production in the region has grown {{as a result of}} the increasing use of inputs, such as fertilisers, <b>supplementary</b> feeds and <b>irrigation</b> water, accompanied by the conversion of plantation forests and areas of extensive sheep and beef grazing into dairy farms. At the same time, there is increasing evidence that Canterbury’s freshwater resources are becoming degraded as a result of increasing inputs of nutrients, bacteria and sediment from these changing land uses (ECan 2008). If these land use changes continue under current management practices, modelling studies suggest that nitrate-N concentrations in shallow groundwater are likely to continue increasing in the future (Di & Cameron 2002; Bidwell et. al. 2009). Faced with this pressure on the region’s water resources, Environment Canterbury is reviewing its approach to managing the cumulative effects of land use, especially diffuse nutrient inputs, on water quality. Initially, Environment Canterbury undertook a preliminary study to examine the effects of agricultural land uses on water quality between the Rakaia and Waimakariri rivers (Di & Cameron 2004). More recently, the Canterbury Mayoral Forum (2009) commissioned modelling at a regional scale to assess the potential changes to water quality as a result of concern over the consequences of intensifying agricultural land uses in the region (Bidwell et. al. 2009). The Proposed Natural Resources Regional Plan set measurable water quality objectives for surface waters and groundwaters addresses point source discharges and sets limits for nutrient losses from irrigated properties in inland areas of Canterbury. However, the plan did not include provisions to adequately address the cumulative effects of nutrient loads from intensifying land uses and multiple point-source discharges. To remedy this problem, Bidwell (2008 & 2009) proposed an allocation approach, based on a “first in first served” basis to address the effects of nitrate-N discharges on shallow groundwater in relation to drinking water quality. A consent application to use water for irrigation would be assessed against existing land uses within a predetermined distance from the property where the proposed activity was going to take place. The discharge of nitrate-N from the proposed activity would be assessed in combination with the estimated nitrate-N leaching from land uses within the “area of interest. ...|$|R

The objective is to estimate the <b>supplementary</b> <b>irrigation</b> required to improve the crop productivity during water stress period. Spatial hydrological model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool, {{has been applied to}} simulate the watershed hydrology and crop growth for rabi season (October-February) considering the rainfed and irrigated scenarios. The average water stress days of rainfed maize was 60 days with yield of 1. 6 t/ha. Irrigated maize with <b>supplementary</b> <b>irrigation</b> of 93 - 126 mm was resulted in improved yield of 3. 8 t/ha with 28 water stress days. The results also suggest that supplemental irrigation can be obtained from groundwater reserves and by adopting early sowing strategy can provide opportunities for improving water productivity in rainfed farming...|$|E

A mathematical model is developed {{for the assessment of}} monthly time series of irrigation water requirements, based on Penman's equation and calibrated {{on the basis of the}} data obtained from irrigation systems in Czechoslovakia. In the model, monthly time series of temperature, relative humidity, sunshine, wind velocity, and precipitation are used as input data. On account of the persistence phenomena often noted in irrigation policies, the correlation between the current irrigation water requirements and those of the previous month was taken into account. The statistical properties of irrigation water requirements have been analyzed as the basis for the generation of a synthetic water requirement time series. The model can be used for long-term planning of water resources systems incorporating <b>supplementary</b> <b>irrigation</b> water use, as is shown in the case of the Labe catchment area in Czechoslovakia...|$|E

Four irrigation levels, i. e. unirrigated control and restoration of maximum crop evapotranspiration (100 % of ETc) for each year; 66 and 33 % of ETc only for the first year, and 50 % of ETc and <b>supplementary</b> <b>irrigation</b> (whenever the soil water potential dropped below - 1. 5 MPa) for the last year, were applied on three cultivars of processing tomato (‘Centurion’, ‘Amur’ and ‘Brigade’). During the two years the highest marketable yield were obtained with maximum restoration of ETc, 51 and 79 t ha- 1 respectively in 1992 and 1993; consequently yield increasing was 225 and 1327 % respect to unirrigated control. The cultivars ‘Amur’ and ‘Brigade’ yielded more than ‘Centurion’ in the first trial; in 1993 ‘Brigade’ was the most productive cultivar in watered treatment with restoration of 50 % of ETc; ‘Amur’, on contrary, in the most irrigated regime. Quality traits were also influenced by irrigation regime; in fact, in 1992, dry matter content of fruits ranged from 7. 6 % in unirrigated control to 5. 9 %, as average, with restoration of 66 and 100 % of ETc. In 1993 fruit dry matter content was 8. 7 % without irrigation, 4. 3 % with the maximum of ETc restoration, and 6. 1 %, as average, with restoration of 50 % of ETc and with <b>supplementary</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Soluble solids content was 9. 2 - 7. 2 - 6. 4 and 4. 6 °Brix respectively in unirrigated control, with <b>supplementary</b> <b>irrigation,</b> and with restoration of 50 and 100 % of ETc. Juice fruit content in the second trial was higher (93 % as average) with <b>supplementary</b> <b>irrigation</b> and restoration of 50 % of ETc than without irrigation and with the restoration of 100 % of ETc (90 %). ‘Brigade’, in two years of research, showed the highest quality of fruit because of size, dry matter and soluble solids content...|$|E
