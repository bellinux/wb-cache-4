50|$|Research at both NDSU and UND has an {{economic}} {{impact on the}} state of North Dakota. A 2007 <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that research at UND had a statewide economic impact of $135.7 million. The same <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that UND research generated a total of 1,649 jobs, of which 728 were on campus. Another 2007 <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that research at NDSU had a statewide economic impact of $100 million.

The same <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that 96 percent could telecommute part-time and 79 percent could telecommute full time. The same <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that $19.9 billion of commuting cost and $21.5 billion in pollution costs {{could be saved}} if government workers and management were to fully embrace telecommuting either from home or remote centers.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review was to summarise evidence {{on the effects of}} job rotation on musculoskeletal complaints, exposures related to musculoskeletal complaints and sustainable working life parameters. A total of 16 studies were included. No studies on sustainable working life parameters were found. The quality of the studies was assessed using a checklist; eight field studies and three laboratory studies of sufficient quality were used to summarise the following evidence: one field <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> positive results and one field <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> negative results for musculoskeletal complaints, two field <b>studies</b> <b>showed</b> positive results and two field <b>studies</b> <b>showed</b> inconsistent results for exposures, and two field <b>studies</b> <b>showed</b> inconsistent results for musculoskeletal complaints and exposures. Two laboratory <b>studies</b> <b>showed</b> inconsistent results and one laboratory <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> no changes for exposures. In conclusion, there is currently inconsistent evidence for positive or negative effects of job rotation on musculoskeletal complaints and exposures related to musculoskeletal complaints. Practitioner's Summary: Currently, there is inconsistent evidence for recommending job rotation as a strategy for preventing musculoskeletal complaints. Exposures from all involved work activities and body regions should be identified and assessed first, to determine if job rotation provides increased exposure variation and/or beneficial changes in mean exposures related to musculoskeletal complaint...|$|R
5|$|A large {{percentage}} of people who live in urban areas have access to parks and gardens in their areas, which are probably the only connections they have with nature. A <b>study</b> <b>shows</b> that having contact with nature helps promote our health and well-being. People who had access to gardens or parks were found to be healthier than those who did not.|$|E
5|$|A recent <b>study</b> <b>shows</b> {{that both}} food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation {{of the eggs}} in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with more time {{to care for the}} nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|Several Omphalotus {{species with}} similar bioluminescent {{properties}} occur worldwide, {{all of which}} are presumed poisonous. The best known are the North American jack o'lantern mushroom (O.olearius) and the tsukiyotake (O.japonicus (Kawam.) Kirchm. & O.K. Mill. (formerly known as Lampteromyces japonicus (Kawam.) Sing.), found in Japan and eastern Asia. A 2004 molecular <b>study</b> <b>shows</b> the ghost fungus to be most closely related to the western jack o'lantern mushroom (O.olivascens), which is abundant in Southern and Central California. Miller notes that the colours and shades of the ghost fungus most closely resemble this species.|$|E

For instance, a meta-analysis of several studies related to distant intercessory healing {{published in the}} Annals of Internal Medicine in 2000 looked at 2774 patients in 23 studies, and found that 13 <b>studies</b> <b>showed</b> statistically significant positive results, 9 <b>studies</b> <b>showed</b> no effect, and 1 <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> a negative result.|$|R

5|$|In 2015 a major DNA {{study of}} golden jackals {{concluded}} that the six C.aureus subspecies found in Africa should be reclassified under the new species C.anthus (African golden wolf), {{reducing the number of}} golden jackal subspecies to seven. The phylogenetic tree generated from this <b>study</b> <b>shows</b> the golden jackal diverging from the wolf/coyote lineage 1.9million years ago and the African golden wolf diverging 1.3million years ago. The study found that the golden jackal and the African golden wolf shared a very similar skull and body morphology and that this had confused taxonomists into regarding these as one species. The study proposes that the very similar skull and body morphology is due to both species having originated from a larger common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American <b>study</b> <b>shows</b> {{significant}} correlation between hair length and age, which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, {{these results indicate that}} hair length and quality can act as a cue to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The correlation between the woman's hair length and marital status, or number of children, was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age.|$|E
5|$|Modern day native {{groups such}} as the Yurok, Tolowa, Karok, Chilula, and Wiyot all have {{historical}} ties to the region, and some Native American groups still live in the park area today. Archaeological <b>study</b> <b>shows</b> they arrived in the area as far back as 3,000 years ago. An 1852 census determined that the Yurok were the most numerous, with 55 villages and an estimated population of 2,500. They used the abundant redwood, which with its linear grain was easily split into planks, as a building material for boats, houses, and small villages. For buildings, the planks would be erected side by side in a narrow trench, with the upper portions bound with leather strapping and held by notches cut into the supporting roof beams. Redwood boards were used to form a shallow sloping roof.|$|E

5|$|The A. sp. is {{from the}} latest Cretaceous aged Lo Hueco region in the Villalba de la Sierra Formation. A <b>study</b> <b>shows</b> that the area around Lo Hueco dates to the late Campanian and early Maastrichtian, {{although}} a more recent study revised the later date to the latest Maastrichtian. The study showed that Lo Hueco was near {{the coast of the}} Tethys Sea, a large seaway through southern Europe and northern Africa. The area directly on the coast was shown to be a brackish-freshwater aquatic environment, with a muddy flood-plain beside it. Lo Hueco was found to be inside the flood-plain. The flood plain was found to have distributary channels of sand and terrigenous material.|$|E
5|$|The {{beliefs of}} the general public about the effect of {{extraterrestrial}} contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about, , the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The <b>study</b> <b>shows</b> significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious beliefs are. The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.|$|E
