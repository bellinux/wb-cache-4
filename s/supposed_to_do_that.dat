40|$|The {{main task}} {{of this project}} were to develop, {{hardware}} and software that could stream audio data via USB 2. 0. This project were based on XMOS, USB 2. 0 design. In this project we have brought an idea to reality {{in the form of}} a finished product. This with verification help from engineers on Syncore technologies. Under the development process the functionality surrounding component databases, provided by Altium designer, were to be evaluated. To be mentioned is that Altium designer was the software used to develop the PCB in this project. After many hours spent developing, we finally got the hardware and software to behave in the way it was <b>suppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>That</b> is, <b>to</b> be able to stream audio data from a high-resolution source(PC/MAC/unit with S/PDIF out, maximum resolution 24 -bit 192 kHz). This to both S/PDIF and analog stereo out via RCA-connectors. The sound quality from a possible subjective point of view is very good and we are happy with the result. We think that the functionality surrounding component databases are convenient in many applications. Not just the fact that you easily can generate an up to date pricing of all components used in a project, you can also shorten the development process. This because the developer don't have to recreate schematic symbols and footprints that has already been created. Which of course was the fundamental idea behind the database functionality. These are just a few examples of its advantages. To be considered is the fact that the administration surrounding the component databases can be very time consuming. To take full advantage of Altium designers functionalities we think that it needs a dedicated administrator that maintains the database repository...|$|R

Black Cat notices that lately the harder she listens to the part of her that tells her not to let anyone put her down, the more her luck gets off the charts. She remembers her life in the elite class before she lost it all. Melter and Killer Shriek bring in Ringer and Black Cat tells him to spread the word that no one steals from her. Two years ago, Felicia Hardy presents a painting in an elite party. In the present day at a museum, Regina Venderkamp, the woman who bought all the items confiscated from the Black Cat in an auction, presents the same painting that Felicia did. However, the lights go out for a moment and the painting is gone. An enraged Regina and her bodyguards go to her apartment only to find all of her treasures gone. She goes upstairs to see if she also took everything there, despite a bodyguard protesting since Black Cat could still be there. Black Cat then appears and says she couldn't leave without Regina learning that no one takes from Black Cat without paying. Regina orders her bodyguards to attack, but Black Cat quickly takes them out. She reflects that her bad luck powers seem to work better when she is ruthless and she may have been holding back before. Black Cat throws one of her claws to Regina's neck causing her to pass out. Hours later, Regina wakes up handcuffed to a chair at Black Cat's hideout. Black Cat contemplates almost all of the items that were confiscated and those she retrieved with only one missing. In J. Jonah Jameson Sr. and Aunt May's apartment, they contemplate the last item the only thing they got at the auction and go watch TV unaware that the Black Cat plans to steal it back. Following Spider-Man's fight with Ghost at Parker Industries, Black Cat places the statue with the rest of her things while having Aunt May, J. Jonah Jameson Sr., and Regina Venderkamp tied up. Jay asks her why did she took them as she doesn't need money and they didn't do nothing to her. Felicia pours gasoline around her apartment and tells Jay he is wrong as they bought her things in the auction, a collection she spent years acquiring. She tells him that's the problem with possessions, they can break, you can lose them or they can be taken. And when that happens, everyone thinks they can take what's yours unless you prove them wrong. She says that nothing and no one will have that hold on him before setting the apartment on fire. When Spider-Man arrives, May warns him that the Black Cat is still in there and Peter asks Felicia for help. She tells him to save them if he wants as she made her point and the more people know the better. Parker tries to convince her that this isn't her but she tells him that the Felicia he knew is gone and she is done being who others want. She tells her that she controls her fate and anyone who stands before that will also be gone. Spider-Man manages to save Aunt May, J. Jonah Jameson Sr., and Regina, who screams at him for not saving her things before May shushes her, telling her that people are what count, not things and Spider-Man knows that. In the Slide-A-Way Casino, Black Cat tells her men that they have seen what happens when they stay on her good side and what happens when they cross her. But from now on, there's nothing holding her back and no limit to what she will do.|$|E

40|$|Judicial {{independence}} is {{a cornerstone of}} American constitutionalism. It empowers judges to check the other branches of government and resolve cases impartially and in accordance with law. Yet independence comes with a hazard. Precisely because they are independent, judges can ignore law and pursue private agendas. For two centuries, scholars have debated those ideas and the underlying tradeoff: independence versus accountability. They have achieved little consensus, in part because independence raises difficult antecedent questions. We cannot decide how independent to make a judge until we agree on what a judge is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>That</b> depends on one’s views about complicated issues like minority rights, the determinacy of law, {{and the nature of}} legalism itself. These complications have paralyzed the debate. This Article presents a way forward. It reduces the debate about independence to a small set of intuitive parameters and shows how they interact. The result is a framework for identifying the optimal degree of judicial independence. The framework transcends the thorny issues bogging down the debate by allowing scholars with diverse views and methodologies to input whatever assumptions they like and get an answer to the question “how independent should judges be?” This framework generates important insights. It shows that independence can implicate a new and fundamental trade-off. Independent judges make some nonlegalistic decisions, and each such decision imposes a high cost on society. Dependent judges make more nonlegalistic decisions, but each imposes a low cost on society. The framework also shows that society may prefer a dependent judge to adjudicate minority rights and that the determinacy of law can be irrelevant to the choice between an independent and a dependent judge. Finally, it shows that the debate rests on deep and contestable assumptions about the value of law. The question is not whether the legalistic decisions that {{independence is}} supposed to facilitate are better than nonlegalistic alternatives. The question is “how much better?...|$|E

40|$|I do {{not know}} whether to call myself a utility infielder or a garbage man, but I have a number of widely {{disparate}} cases to talk about, all of which affect state and local governments in a very significant way. I want to start with Harper v. Virginia Department of Taxation, the retroactivity case, because this one produced an interesting split between the so-called conservative judges. I {{do not know}} if there are Federalists out there, but two basic propositions of Federalist doctrine were at issue here. One was the extent of state immunity from federal taxation, and the other was the whole question of retroactivity. To a Federalist, {{it is very important that}} state governments not be imposed upon by federal courts and federal tax problems. On the other hand, they like to think of courts as always discovering the law, not making the law. If you were a possible candidate for a federal judgeship and you went to the Justice Department in the Reagan and Bush. Administration, the very first question they would ask you is, “are you in favor of judges making law or do you think judges simply discover law?” You had better get that question right or you are not going to go any further. And, of course, the doctrine is that judges never make law, they discover law. Problems of retroactivity implicate that very key issue. Under what circumstances should a court, having made either a constitutional or a non-constitutional determination, say that a law applies in this case and in future cases, but it does not apply backwards. Any governmental body that says, “This is the law from now on,” is making law. I do not know how else to describe it. Judges are not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> they are supposed to say, “Oh, we were blind, but now we can see. We did not know what the law was. Now we know. It is the law and oh, by the way, it always was the law. ” If there is one strong Federalist doctrine, it is that judges should not make law and therefore a decision should always apply retroactively. The Harper case involved that issue in a very significant way for state and local governments...|$|E
40|$|Making {{a profit}} from credit Cue: A private credit {{offering}} institution, like the Malawi Rural Finance Company, will soon {{go out of}} business if borrowers fail to keep up their repayments. Such companies need effective ways of maximising repayments, while also deciding how they will respond to natural disasters such as drought, which can greatly effect people?s ability to pay off their loans. Many institutions have realised that lending to groups rather than individuals can improve rates of repayment. The Malawi Rural Finance Company has also taken this approach, and supports the groups who borrow from it with a variety of training packages. Excello Zidana spoke to Charles Nangwale, Credit Officer of the Northern Region Branch, and asked him what mechanisms the company was using both to support the farmers who borrow from it, and to keep itself in business. IN:		?We know people are different? OUT:		?to improve their life standard. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 56 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Charles Nangwale explaining how the Malawi Rural Finance Company balances its goals, both supporting farmers and staying in business. Transcript Nangwale	We know people are different, we are born with different characters and we want these {{people to be able to}} work together. So the first thing is, we train them on group dynamics. And after that we train them on the particular farming activity or business they want to carry out. Then we teach them our credit procedures so that they understand how we want them to run the businesses, how we want them to repay our loans. Zidana	In any society there might be some people who are definitely not honest. If they fail to honour their loans what do you do? Nangwale	We are working to assist the people but at a profit. So we have tried to be a bit clever. During the training we teach those people to draw a constitution which is supposed to govern, you know, their group. So in that constitution they are supposed to outline what are they going to do should somebody fail to repay their loan or should somebody maybe passes away, what is going to happen? The first thing is those people themselves are going to take an action against whoever has failed to repay the loan. But then if the group has failed to do that, then we come in and that?s why, you know, we have things like loan agreements so that we know we can act on these people without any legal problems. Zidana		Now during the times of natural disasters like drought what do you do? Nangwale	Drought is unpredictable and you cannot prevent drought. We know this is a problem, it is not the customer?s making, it?s something that has just happened to him. So we give those people an opportunity to reschedule their loan so that they can repay it maybe in the next two years, should there be no drought that is again. Zidana	I understand that most lending institutions before they give out loans, they think of sureties. What does your company do in this regard? Nangwale	Yes we also require these people to give us what we call collateral. Of course we don?t require collateral for all the loans because Rural Finance has targeted everybody so we know there are people out there in the villages who cannot raise collateral. So for those people we give them loans which don?t require collateral. But for those people who want loans that require collateral, we require two types of collateral, cash collateral and material collateral. In cash collateral we require our customers to pay 20 % cash deposit of the loan they are looking for. And material collateral is supposed to be 150 % of the loan they are looking for. Zidana	But as you said that your main focus is on the poor of the poorest farmers. So when we go around you see people in the villages, they are still very poor and some even complain that your company tends to take other items as part of the whole strategy of loan recovery. Is this act aimed at helping farmers? Nangwale	Yes if you remember what I said, I said Rural Finance is a company which is there to assist the farmers and the general public as a whole. But then we are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> at a profit, because if we don?t make profit then we won?t survive. When somebody has failed to pay us back there must be a way of getting back our money you see because we are in business. Much as we want to assist the farmers they shouldn?t just take that as a grant, they should actually work to pay off the loan and to improve their life standard. End of tape. Charles Nangwale explaining how the Malawi Rural Finance Company balances its goals, both supporting farmers and staying in business...|$|E
5000|$|The {{first chapter}} {{introduces}} Sue, a new student in Mrs. Jewls's class. She is bewildered {{to discover that}} the arithmetic lessons involve adding words instead of numbers, using verbal arithmetic. Chapter 1 has 11 problems all about adding and subtracting using words. In the next chapter, Sue complains <b>that</b> they're not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> math <b>that</b> way, and says a few problems (for example, seven + four = eleven), which Mrs. Jewls states is impossible, and the reader has to figure out why the problems Sue mentioned are impossible. In the next chapter, Mrs. Jewls tells Sue that if she doesn't understand how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> math here, she should change to a different school, but when Sue inadvertently gets a question correct, Mrs. Jewls lets her stay. Chapter 4 also contains multiplication problems. Chapter 5 is about recess, where after a storyline is told, the students have to figure the answer of a few questions about what happened at recess. Chapter 6 involves Mrs. Jewls having trouble filling out report cards because she doesn't have all the grades, so she needs to figure out the answers on the quizzes in order to grade the students. Chapter 7 involves more logical questions, and Chapter 8 presents the reader with [...] "true or false" [...] tests in which the assertions refer to themselves. The last chapter is about Sue finally making a new friend, Joy (who stays after school trying to figure out her true or false test involving the liar's paradox), and they go home together after school.|$|R
40|$|On {{a modern}} pirate ship, a mystery transpires: {{who is the}} crew, {{how did they get}} there, and what are they <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>that</b> huge iron bull {{standing}} on the deck? This giddy romp of a play imagines a future for the captain of the one vessel that managed to rescue survivors from The Titanic disaster. Invested with a special right – eternal life – he has taken to exploring the world by sea, in search of something worth dying for. Now, trying to save a great city from sliding into decay, he has assembled a crew of misfits to help him fulfill his mission. When they are suddenly captured by the royal naval, they must put their heads together to devise a plan that can save them all – and give the Captain what he has been seeking. With this play, the wildly imaginative Maksym Kurochkin throws us into a tumultuous day at sea, where we ride along with the Captain and his crew of five souls, passionately clinging to life, plus a samurai who has turned up for no apparent reason. By the end of the tale, both the Captain and the samurai have found their purpose, and the crew has turned into a family (in more ways than one). Yet the mystery remains – who will inherit the right of the Captain of the R. M. S. Carpathia: who wants to have eternal life – and what is the price that must be paid for it...|$|R
50|$|Daniel {{returned}} home on July 10, 2008, {{and he found}} out from his girlfriend, Amber, that his mother, Phyllis Summers Newman, {{had been trying to}} break them up by making Amber believe that Daniel had been cheating on her. Soon after, she informed him that she slept with Adrian Korbel out of inadequacy, whereupon he angrily and suddenly broke up with her and left her apartment, much to her devastation. He struggled to get over the break-up via rebound dates with Colleen Carlton. On October 15, 2008, Amber and Daniel got back together.In early 2009, Daniel started his painting and drawing with Amber at his side as a fashion designer. In mid 2009, Daniel was asked to make a fake copy of a 'Terroni,' and he would get paid a sum of money for it. Later, it is believed that he and Jana Hawkes, Kevin's wife, killed the man who asked him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this in an alley. Daniel managed to stay out of jail long enough to meet Deacon Sharpe, Amber's ex-lover and father of Amber's adopted child, Eric Sharpe, when she was in Los Angeles. Then, Daniel was put in jail, leaving Amber {{to get him out of}} jail herself. While Daniel was in jail, he received a phone call from Deacon, claiming to be Michael, Daniel's lawyer. On the other end, he heard Amber and Deacon having sex. When Amber visited him later, he yelled at her, asking her why she <b>did</b> <b>that</b> and what was he <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> now <b>that</b> he was going to propose to her. Amber and Daniel consequently broke up. Daniel was soon released, due to the DVD that Deacon sent to the A.D.A, Heather Stevens.|$|R
5000|$|Scott A. Johnson of Dread Central {{wrote that}} the film soundtrack, as {{composed}} and conducted by Chris Walden, was performed by West Australian Philharmonic Orchestra, and [...] "contains everything one would expect from a movie aimed at kids around ten years old." [...] Johnson stated that the soundtrack's failure was [...] "in its lack of through-line and 'signature' sound'", but <b>that</b> the tracks <b>did</b> what they were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> in <b>that</b> it [...] "takes the film, amplifies its emotions, and does {{so in a way}} that is kid-friendly." [...] Soundtrack Geek {{wrote that the}} soundtrack of the Monster Mutt film was released to show Walden's skill as a composer. They wrote that as the trailer [...] "looks horrifying from an adult perspective, but more fun for the kids", the film is one that an adult might not otherwise see [...] "unless you have children between the age of 5 and 10". In their review of the soundtrack, they wrote of the composer, [...] "Emmy Award winner Chris Walden has been stuck in TV movie land since the early nighties, but now he has a chance to shine in a proper movie." [...] Tracksounds wrote that the soundtrack for Monster Mutt [...] "captures all the different genres in a kid flick - and them some", and that it was [...] "an unexpected pleasure to listen to". They also wrote that this is [...] "another instance of wishing we could see what the composer can do with a bigger budget or bigger screen". [...] Sci-fi-online wrote that [...] "Chris Walden's score for Monster Mutt is about a million times better than the low budget movie ... that it accompanies", and it is otherwise [...] "a great score which is unfortunately not helped by being associated with a mediocre kids film".|$|R
