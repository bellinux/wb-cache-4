50|$|Australia's top order capitulated {{with none}} of the top five scoring over 15 runs. There was some {{resistance}} from Hussey and Haddin, but ultimately Australia were unable to bat out the innings, running out of wickets and posting a very low score. Australia did however put the pressure on with the ball and for most of the chase New Zealand was behind Australia score at the same points in time. Michael Clarke clean-bowled a batsman but replays showed that the bails were dislodged by Haddin's gloves, which were in front of the <b>stumps.</b> The <b>loss</b> was Australia's fourth consecutive ODI loss, having just been defeated 1-4 against South Africa.|$|R
25|$|The series {{ended with}} a one-off Test, {{starting}} in Bowral on 15 February 2008, when {{at the age of}} 17 years and 3 months, Perry became the youngest ever Australian Test cricketer. The hosts batted first collapsed to be 5/59 after 31.1 overs on the first day, bringing Perry to the crease to join Kate Blackwell. Perry made 21 from 77 balls in 79 minutes, hitting two fours, before being run out by throw from Laura Marsh to English wicket-keeper Sarah Taylor. This ended a 50-run partnership, the largest of the innings; Australia were eventually out for 154 on the first day. Perry then opened the bowling, taking the new ball alongside Emma Sampson. The pair failed to take a wicket in their initial spell and England reached <b>stumps</b> without <b>loss.</b> The next day, Perry had opener Caroline Atkins caught by wicket-keeper Leonie Coleman for 15 to claim her maiden Test wicket to leave England at 1/26 after 22.4 overs. After Sampson removed Beth Morgan the next over without addition to the score, England captain Charlotte Edwards combined with Claire Taylor to put on a partnership of 159 before Perry removed top-scorer Edwards for 94, also caught by Coleman. This wicket sparked a collapse as England lost their remaining eight wickets for 59 runs. Perry also took her first catch in Tests; she caught Rosalie Birch to give fellow debutant Kirsten Pike her first Test wicket. Perry ended with 2/49 from 23 overs as the tourists replied with 244 to take a 90-run lead.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade the South African {{forestry}} industry has gradually experienced the ramifications of labour scarcity, increases in labour costs, the effect of HIV and AIDS and increasing timber demand. Consequently, {{this has led to}} an increase in the mechanisation rate, especially in timber harvesting operations. Due to the labour challenges in South Africa, mechanised forestry equipment has increasingly been required to operate in complex forest conditions, such as coppiced compartments, where they have not operated before. It therefore occurs that harvesters are either used in certain coppiced compartments with uncertain productivity expectations, or the harvesters are not used in these compartments {{due to a lack of}} productivity knowledge. The influence that certain factors have on harvester productivity and <b>stump</b> volume <b>loss</b> – factors such as coppice regeneration practices and stem form – is poorly understood and has not been quantified. No scientific research exists regarding the effects of coppice compartments on the productivity of a harvester and the amount of stump volume waste. This research aimed at determining the influence of tree volume, tree form, stem felled first and distance between stems on the productivity of an excavator based harvester in coppiced double, coppiced single and planted Eucalyptus grandis pulpwood compartments. Furthermore, the research determined whether there was any stump volume waste, and quantified how much of it was due to excessive stump heights by the harvester. Through regression analysis, productivity equations were derived to make productivity predictions in both coppiced and planted compartments. All stumps were evaluated for waste and the average stump volume waste in coppiced double, coppiced single and planted trees was determined. The research results showed that planted trees had the highest productivity across all tree sizes, followed by coppiced single trees and then coppiced double stems. When harvesting a 0. 2 m 3 tree, the mean harvester productivity was 8. 7 m 3 per PMH in coppiced double trees, 13. 8 m 3 per PMH in coppiced single trees and 16. 1 m 3 per PMH in planted trees. In coppiced double stems the productivity was not significantly influence by the distance between stems. However, the productivity was significantly influenced by the stem felled first. The regression results showed that if the smaller stem was felled first, the productivity would increase if the larger stem’s volume was less than 0. 18 m 3; however where the larger stem was greater than 0. 18 m 3, the relationship was reversed. In addition, the productivity for both coppiced single trees and coppiced double stems were significantly influenced by stem form. The poorly formed trees had low productivity compared to the trees with good form. The stump volume findings showed that coppiced double stems had the highest average stump volume waste per stump, with 0. 00307 m 3 waste, followed by coppiced single trees (0. 001954 m 3) and planted trees (0. 001650 m 3). The average stump volume waste per stump with waste for the planted trees was negligible. This research provides forestry companies and harvesting contractors with information on the effect of tree volume, tree form and stem felled first on harvester productivity in E. grandis coppiced double, coppiced single and planted compartments. This information will assist in making equipment and system selection decisions and improve operational management and control. In addition, they will also be aware of <b>stump</b> volume <b>losses</b> that will occur in the three scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{immunohistochemical}} {{profile of the}} atypical nuclei in leiomyoma with bizarre nuclei and compare with benign and malignant counterparts. Methods: 26 cases of uterine smooth muscle tumors including 12 leiomyosarcoma(LMS), 10 leiomyoma with bizarre nuclei (LBN) and 4 smooth muscle tumor with uncertain malignant potential (STUMP) were selected using whole tissue sections for this study and analysis. Six cases of ordinary leiomyoma were included as benign control group. All representative section were stained for P 53, Ki 67, estrogen receptor and progestrone receptor. Analysis was carried out using SPSS 16. 0 for windows software. Results: Six out of 12 cases of LMS showed strong and diffuse nuclear staining with p 53 antibody (50 %). In contrast none of STUMPs and only one case of LBN cases showed focal positive reaction with P 53. Percentage of positive cells for ki 67 in LMS was 14. 92 while only 0. 85 % of cells in LBNs was labeled with Ki 67 proliferative marker. (P< 0. 001). Regarding steroid hormone receptors a significant loosing trend was found in these receptors from benign toward malignant tumors through LBN and <b>STUMP</b> cases. Conclusion: <b>Loss</b> of inhibitory function of wild type P 53 gene in leiomyosarcoma is an essential event that discriminate frankly malignant tumors from STUMP and atypical leiomyoma...|$|R
25|$|Going {{into the}} game, India made four changes: batsmen Borde and Sardesai, and bowlers Surti and Abid Ali were dropped for Eknath Solkar and debutante Gundappa Viswanath, and Subrata Guha, Ashok Gandotra respectively, while {{including}} Ambar Roy as the twelfth man. Australia retained {{the team from}} the first Test. India captain Pataudi won the toss and opted to bat first. Mankad and Engineer got the team off to a strong start completing a 100-run partnership in 96 minutes, first for the team since January 1967. An aggressive Engineer was dismissed caught and bowled by Stackpole off his first ball, after making 77, which included 12 fours. Mankad scored his half-century when he cut Gleeson for a four after lunch, before getting out in similar manner for an Ashley Mallett delivery. Viswanath followed him without scoring a run. Including Viswanath, Alan Connolly dismissed Wadekar and Gandotra, in a display characterized by accuracy, reducing India to 197/5. India batted to <b>stumps</b> without further <b>loss,</b> ending at 237/5. On resumption of play the following day, India lost wickets at regular intervals including Pataudi in the second over to Graham McKenzie, and the lower-order to Connolly and Ashley Mallett before winding up at 320. Australia's first innings began with a 48-run stand for the first wicket before Lawry was caught at short leg by Solkar off Venkataraghavan. Stackpole was run out for 40 {{a few minutes later}} before Chappell was done in by a topspinner off Venkataraghavan. Australia closed at stumps on 105/3.|$|R
40|$|Stumps {{account for}} a large {{proportion}} of coarse woody debris in managed forests, but their decay dynamics are poorly understood. The loss of mass and the degree of humification of the above-ground woody debris, below-ground woody debris, bark and root system (R 1, 10 mm ≥ diameter > 0 mm; R 2, 25 mm ≥ diameter > 10 mm; 100 mm ≥ R 3 > 25 mm; R 4 > 100 mm) of Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) stump systems were evaluated in southwestern China in a chronosequence of plantations cut 1 - 15 years prior to the study. The results indicated that above-ground woody debris decomposed more quickly than below-ground woody debris and bark, whereas the degree of humification followed the opposite trend. Compared with one-year <b>stumps,</b> the mass <b>losses</b> of 15 -year stump systems were 60. 4 % for above-ground woody debris, 42. 1 % for below-ground woody debris, 47. 3 % for bark, 69. 9 % for R 1, 47. 3 % for R 2, 51. 0 % for R 3, and 83. 2 % for R 4. In contrast, below-ground woody debris showed a greater degree of humification compared with other components in the stump system. Among the root system, fine roots (R 1, diameter ≤ 10 mm) had the largest k value (0. 09), whereas the decay rate of coarser roots (R 2, R 3, R 4; diameter > 10 mm) increased with increasing root diameter. However, coarse roots showed a larger degree of humification (0. 2 - 0. 6) than fine roots (0. 3 - 0. 4). These results suggest that below-ground woody debris and coarse roots may display a higher degree of humification, showing greater short-term contributions to overall humification when compared with the other components in the stump system...|$|R
