40|$|Although {{current and}} {{proposed}} reprocessing of used nuclear fuel is performed predominantly by <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>processes,</b> solid phase sorbent materials have many advantages including {{the ability to}} avoid production of large volumes of organic waste. Therefore, three titania nanoparticle based sorbent materials have been developed, functionalized with organic ligands designed to impart selectivity for elements relevant to important separations at {{the back end of}} the nuclear fuel cycle. A novel, simplified method of covalent functionalization to the titania surface has been utilized, and the resulting materials {{have been shown to be}} hydrolytically stable at pH 2. The sorption behavior of these organofunctionalized titania materials was investigated over a wide pH range with a selection of elements including fission products and actinides. Titania nanoparticles functionalized with an amine or phosphate moiety were able to demonstrate exclusive extraction of uranium under optimized conditions. Titania nanoparticles functionalized with a picolinamide moiety exhibited superior minor actinide sorption properties, in terms of both efficiency and selectivity, to <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>processes</b> using similar organic moieties. As such, organo-functionalized titania materials as solid phase sorbents show promise as a future alternative to <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>processes</b> for nuclear separations. © 2013, American Chemical Society...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> is now finding {{applications}} {{in a broader}} range of fields than the past. Many of these applications require process equipment with shorter contact times, and in some cases {{to the point where the}} traditional equilibrium stage approach is not a good model for predicting performance. In addition, feed streams are becoming lower in concentration of the solute. This means greater feed to solvent flow ra-tios are being used and so loss of organics as entrainment in the feed is more of a concern both economi-cally and environmentally. These trends mean that a greater emphasis is being placed on the kinetics of ex-traction and stripping in models to predict performance and on formation and coalescence of drops to con-trol entrainment. This paper reviews recent advances in the tools for investigating kinetics and coalescence in <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>processes</b> and some of the insights that are being uncovered in these fundamental <b>processes</b> in <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> technology.
