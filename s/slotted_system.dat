The primary objective is to derive a distributed coordination method for schedule construction and modification for any wireless ad-hoc network operating under a schedule where transmissions at each slot are explicitly specified over a time period of length T. We first introduce a fluid model of the system where the conflict avoidance requirements of neighboring links are relaxed while the aspect of local channel sharing is captured. In this model we propose an algorithm where the nodes asynchronously re-adjust the rates allocated to their adjacent links using only local information.

40|$|Abstract—A coding problem, over a <b>slotted</b> <b>system,</b> is intro-duced {{where the}} sender has to {{transmit}} {{one out of}} several packets to the receiver, but learns the request only {{at the beginning of}} each slot with prior statistical information about which packet is needed at the receiver. There is an associated cost of sending bits at each slot, and the goal is to minimize the expected cost of the communication. A proactive coding scheme is proposed, where the source proactively communicates with the receiver before the receiver requests the message. This way, by designing a cost optimal side information at the receiver, the scheme is able to minimize the expected cost of the communication. Numerical results are provided demonstrating the gains obtained by proactive coding over the conventional coding technique. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{distributed}} {{wireless access}} networks, the short-term unfairness of IEEE 802. 11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) has been revealed by many works. In this paper, a modified DCF, {{based on the}} principle of Priority Collision Resolution (PCR), is proposed to improve the short-term fairness in distributed access wireless networks. Our PCR-DCF achieves short-term fairness improvement without estimating behaviors of other users and the system contention level, such as the number of active users. Only the capability to identify collision is required. Theoretical analysis is carried out to validate the performance of PCR-DCF based on a <b>slotted</b> <b>system</b> model. Both simulations and analyses show that PCR-DCF has a much smaller packet transmission delay jitter than IEEE 802. 11 DCF, with little degradation on the average packet transmission delay. Moreover, the analysis and simulation results indicate that PCR-DCF also experiences a much lower packet drop rate than IEEE 802. 11 DCF in almost all load ranges with reasonable retransmission limit.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} optimally allocating the base station transmit power in two neighboring cells for a TDMA wireless cellular system, to maximize the total system throughput under interference and noise impairments. Employing dynamic reuse of spectral resources, we impose a peak power constraint at each base station and allow for coordination between the base stations. By an analytical derivation {{we find that the}} optimal power allocation then has a remarkably simple nature: Depending on the noise and channel gains, transmit at full power only at base station 1 or base station 2, or both. Utilizing the optimal power allocation we study optimal link adaptation, and compare to adaptive transmission without power control. Results show that allowing for power control significantly increases the overall capacity for an average user pair, in addition to considerable power savings. Furthermore, we investigate power adaptation in combination with scheduling of users in a time <b>slotted</b> <b>system.</b> Specifically, the capacity-optimal singlecell scheduler [1] is generalized to the two-cell case. Thus, both power allocation and multiuser diversity are exploited to give substantial network capacity gains. I...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{broadcast}} of periodic messages {{is a key}} functionality in vehicular ad hoc networks. In the emerging vehicular networks, IEEE 802. 11 p is the standard of choice to support the PHY and MAC layer functionalities. The broadcast process in IEEE 802. 11 p {{is based on the}} CSMA mechanism where a device transmitting a packet senses the channel for on-going transmissions and performs a random back-off before accessing the channel. In spite of the absence of RTS/CTS mechanisms, carrier sensing is expected to provide a protection region around the transmitter where no other transmitters are allowed. However, at increasing densities, the CSMA behavior breaks down to an ALOHA-like transmission pattern indicating a lack of protection around transmitters. In this paper, we model the CSMA mechanism as a <b>slotted</b> <b>system</b> and analytically characterize the critical node/packet arrival density where the CSMA mechanism approaches an ALOHA-like behavior. Further, when the node density exceeds the critical density and ALOHA-type of behavior dominates, we can use tools from stochastic geometry to establish closed form expressions for the key performance metrics of the broadcast mechanism...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{investigates the}} benefit of {{adaptive}} modulation based on channel state information (CSI) in direct-sequence/ code-division multiple-access (DS/CDMA) multihop packet radio networks. By exploiting varying channel conditions, adaptive modulation {{can be used in}} ad hoc networks to provide upper layers with higher capacity links over which to relay traffic. Using the-stable interference model, the distribution of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is obtained for a <b>slotted</b> <b>system</b> of randomly, uniformly distributed nodes using multilevel coherent modulation schemes. Performance is evaluated in terms of the information efficiency, which is a new progress-related measure for multihop networks. Three types of adaptivity are analyzed, differing in the level of CSI available: 1) full knowledge of the SIR at the receiver; 2) knowledge of only the signal attenuation due to fading; and 3) knowledge of only the slow fading component of the signal attenuation. The effect of imperfect channel information is also investigated. Sample results are given for interference-limited networks experiencing fourth-power path loss with distance, Ricean fading, and lognormal shadowing.

40|$|Abstract-The multiple-access {{capability}} of asynchronous frequencyhop packet radio networks is analyzed. The only interference considered is multiple-access interference, and perfect side information is assumed. Bounds are developed on {{the probability of}} error for unslotted systems based on the distributions of the maximum and minimum interference levels over the duration of a given packet, and these are employed to develop corresponding bounds on the throughput. Our idealized model enables the derivation of asymptotic results showing the convergence of these bounds for high traffic levels, and the asymptotic performance {{of the system is}} seen to be {{the same as that of}} the corresponding <b>slotted</b> <b>system.</b> Results are also obtained for the maximum asymptotic throughput. These results shows that the asymptotic sum capacity of the channel can be attained using Reed-Solomon coding. All these results are valid for either fixed or exponentially distributed packet lengths. Our results indicate that the performance of frequency-hop networks is insensitive both to the distribution of packet lengths and to whether or not transmissions are slotted. It also demonstrates the efficacy of Reed-Solomon coding in combating multiple-access interference. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Many {{small scale}} {{telecommunication}} networks {{operate in a}} slotted mode with constant data packet sizes. Some of these systems have only modest hardware and hence, queuing performance is an important issue. Performance analysis of slotted systems requires more than simply obtaining the performance figures of discrete-time Markov chains. This paper elucidates the importance of characterizing the timing and synchronization details required to correctly formulate the Markov chain and evaluate corresponding performance figures. Two distinct Markov chains are identified in such analysis of any <b>slotted</b> <b>system.</b> The events causing different transitions between the system states are systematically developed for both Markov chains. Relationships between time-averaged performance figures and corresponding expectations of both the Markov chains are developed. The approach is demonstrated by providing easier solutions to some slotted systems found in the literature. A few other apparently different modes of operation and corresponding models are shown {{to fall into the}} two model categories studied here.
