In a {{perspective}} of stable industrial development to manufacture added consistent and economical industrial product, gears are ever more focus to requirements {{in terms of}} power capability, efficiency and compactness etc. In order to increase the performance factors of gears such as transmission capacity, efficiency, gear life, etc. is a difficult criteria for a design engineers as these are all progress in a conflicting behavior. This paper deals with the multi-objective optimization of <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> design with two contradictory objective functions such as maximization of power transmission and minimization of volume of the gear drive. These objectives are approached by an optimization technique based on a Sheep Flocks Heredity Model Algorithm (SFHM) with design constraints like stress, center distance etc. A spur gear problem is solved with traditional trial method and results are compared with proposed algorithm...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the higher}} speed ratio and profile shifted gear drives, the maximum fillet {{stress in the}} pinion and the gear is not equal. The {{load-carrying}} {{capacity of the gear}} drives can be improved by removing this unbalanced maximum fillet stress. This paper has explained an idea to remove this unbalanced maximum fillet stress and design the spur gear drives with uniform fillet strength. This uniform fillet strength of the gear drive can be achieved by changing the tooth thickness of basic racks on the pitch lines from the standard tooth thickness (0. 5 πm) in to a non-standard one (kgcπm, kgc≠ 0. 5). The influence of gear parameters such as backup ratio, cutter tip radius and addendum modification factors on the maximum fillet stress has been analyzed through FEM with different values of tooth thickness coefficient and finally the optimum value of tooth thickness coefficient are suggested for the given <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> that improve the fillet capacity in bending...|$|E

The engine was inclined at 35°, and fitted with a <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>driven</b> double overhead camshaft, a four valve head and five speed gearbox. The engine was said to produce 9.5 bhp at 14,000 rpm.|$|R

50|$|The term {{layshaft}} originates with watermill machinery. The layshaft is the gear-carrying shaft {{that links}} the wallower (the small <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>driven</b> at increased speed by the waterwheel) to any upright shafts that carry the millstones.

40|$|A gear is a {{rotating}} machine part having cut tooth, which mesh with another toothed part {{in order to}} transmit torque. Gears are mainly type like spur gears, helical gears, double helical gears, bevel gears, crown gears, hypoid gears, worm gears, rack and pinion, epicyclic gears etc. The application of these gears fled from tiny wrist watches to huge machinery equipment gears from vital elements of mechanism in many machines such as automobile, aerospace industry, rolling mills, hoisting and transmitting machinery, marine engines, and the like. Parallel and co-planer shaft connected by gears are known as spur gear. Spur gear have straight tooth and are parallel to the axis of the wheel. Spur gears are {{most common type of}} gears. A pair of spur gear tooth in action is generally subjected to two types of cyclic stress: contact stress and bending stress including bending fatigue. Both stress may not attain their maximum values at the same point of contact fatigue. These types of failure can be minimized by analysis of the problem during the design stage and creating proper tooth surface profile with proper manufacturing methods. In this paper using ansys work bench software, bending stress, contact stress and static load on the tooth of <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> is found...|$|E
40|$|The torus {{involute}} gear drive originates from the involute <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>drive,</b> which {{is composed of}} a gear with convex teeth and the one with concave teeth. Previous researches of its mesh principle indicate that the torus {{involute gear}} can compensate large axial misalignments in parallel-shaft transmission, while its dynamic behavior has not been investigated comprehensively, or {{compared with that of}} the standard involute gear. This paper focuses on the dynamic performance of this type of gear. Considering the time variation of meshing stiffness, a 6 -degree-of-freedom dynamics model of the torus involute gear pair is established, which counts in the effect of alternate meshing of single-double tooth pairs. Sliding friction in elastohydrodynamic lubrication is also included in the model. The numerical analysis for six cases is conducted, and the dynamic characteristics such as the dynamic transmission error, mechanical efficiency, sliding friction forces and minimum oil-film thickness are compared with those of the standard involute gear. The results show that, the torus involute gear drive exhibits good performances as the standard involute gear drive in transmission accuracy and mechanical efficiency, while, it has a better performance in lubrication condition. The study in this paper may lay theoretical foundations for practical application of the torus involute gears...|$|E

40|$|Gear {{researchers}} are {{always trying to}} find a trade-off solution between obtaining accurate results from gear stress analyses and low computational costs. Both factors, accuracy on the one hand, and a low computational cost on the other hand, usually go in opposite directions. In this paper, a finite element model for stress analysis of gear drives is proposed with the ultimate goal of obtaining accurate results regarding contact and bending stresses with lower computational cost than those finite element models where mesh refinement is not applied. The proposed finite element model allows the whole cycle of meshing to be analyzed and is based on the application of multi-point constraints for mesh refinement and the application of elements with a reduced number of integration points. Node coordinates are computationally and automatically determined by application of the gear theory. Several numerical examples are presented for a <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>drive,</b> although the same ideas can be applied in other types of gear drives. Accurate results of maximum contact pressure along the cycle of meshing with an important reduction of computational cost are achieved, mainly due to the reduction of the number of degrees of freedom that multi-point constrains provide, rather than by the use of reduced-integration elements.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} when standard spur gears are in mesh is the appearance of edge contact on the gear tooth surfaces caused by misalignments. Those misalignments are caused partially by deflections of gear supporting shafts. As {{a result of an}} edge contact, a non-favorable condition of the bearing contact occurs, yielding high level of contact stresses. An intensive research and many practical solutions have been directed to modify the gear tooth surfaces in order to avoid edge contact. An innovative procedure is proposed here for: (1) determination of errors of alignment caused by shaft deflections, (2) compensation of predicted shaft deflections during generation of spur gears, and (3), obtaining a favorable function of transmission errors for the design load. A finite element model of a <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> that comprises pinion and gear supporting shafts is used for the determination of errors of alignment along a cycle of meshing. Compensation of misalignments caused by shaft deflections in gear generation is then accomplished by modification of pinion tooth surfaces whereas the gear tooth surfaces are kept unmodified. Additional modifications of pinion tooth surfaces may be required for obtaining a favorable function of transmission errors. The effect of several misalignment compensations in the reduction of contact stresses has been investigated. Postprocessing of load intensity functions and loaded transmission errors is included. The developed approach is illustrated with numerical examples.
