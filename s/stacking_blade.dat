The name “blade server” came from the form of the server; it combined an ultra-efficient microprocessor made by noted Silicon Valley startup Transmeta (formerly NYSE:TMTA) and other efficient server components on a single printed-circuit-board assembly permitting RLX to <b>stack</b> <b>blades</b> in a Telco-rack-mounted cabinet materially increasing the server density per Telco rack. As the Internet exploded in 2009, the market demanded greater server density - to house the Internet’s growing content - but, the market needed an ultra-efficient server platform to meet that demand. The “blade server” became an industry-standard platform by 2005, when HP bought RLX for an undisclosed sum.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} testing of a transonic compressor rotor with forward sweep. The rotor was used to investigate the in uence of forward sweep on the performance and stability of a single-stage transonic compressor compared with a baseline design with radially <b>stacked</b> <b>blade</b> sections. The comparison was done numerically with the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes code TRACE-S and experi-mentally in the Darmstadt transonic compressor test rig. It {{was found that the}} new rotor with forward sweep has an increased ef ciency and also a much better stall margin (much more in the rig test than predicted by the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes calculation). Particularly close to stall, the forward sweep diverts the ow towards the blade tip region which helps to stabilise this region. For that reason it is possible to throttle the forward-swept rotor much further than the radially stacked rotor, although the forward-swept rotor does already suffer from separated ow in the hub...|$|R

2500|$|European-style cabinet saws {{are often}} more complex and modern in design {{compared}} to American types. They often are equipped with a sliding table to make cross cuts easier and safer than {{by the use of}} an American style mitre gauge. Unless modified for the American market, European table saws are not equipped to allow the use of a <b>stacked</b> dado <b>blade</b> set (this is due to safety laws in European markets). Rip fences on European saws tend to be of lighter construction and less smooth in operation compared to American cabinet saws. European cabinet saws are often available in multi-purpose tool configurations that can offer jointer, planer, shaper or boring features. The blade arbor typically has a diameter of 30mm, though for the American market a [...] " [...] arbor is commonly available as an option. Note that American woodworkers are likely to use a <b>stacked</b> dado <b>blade</b> to cut dados (square sectioned grooves) where European woodworkers might use a shaper or other tool for this task. European cabinet saws often incorporate a riving knife to prevent kickback. Riving knives differ from American style splitters in that they rise and fall with the blade (splitters are fixed in place without regard for the height that the blade is adjusted to). Riving knives have since become commonplace on newer American-market tablesaws due to the Consumer Products Safety Commission and UL recommendation in the early to mid-2000s that American-market saws have riving knives (UL std. 987.) European cabinet saws often offer as an option a scoring blade, which is a second, smaller diameter blade mounted in front of the regular saw blade. The scoring blade helps reduce splintering in certain types of stock, especially laminated stock. As of 2015, European-style sliding cabinet saws have a small following in the U.S. They are either imported from European manufacturers such as Felder, Hammer, and Robland or sold directly by U.S. based-companies such as Grizzly Industrial.|$|R

Tip leakage loss changes due to three-dimensional <b>blade</b> <b>stacking</b> (bowing or reverse bowing) are verified to be associated with changes in the magnitude of blade tip loading, which create differences in the leakage flow exit velocities. The effect of a downstream diffusing transition duct on tip leakage losses is small; there was a 3. 6 % increase in tip leakage loss for a 65 % increase in duct exit-to-inlet area ratio compared to a constant area duct. For unsteadiness arising from an upstream nozzle guide vane, it is shown that substantial temporal fluctuations in vortex core velocity and loss generation exist. However, the time average tip leakage loss differed less than 5 % from the tip leakage loss calculated on a steady flow basis. Based on the computations, the mechanism for tip leakage vortex loss in the three different situations examined appears to be similar to that which is seen for an isolated turbine blade. by Steven Mazur.

40|$|A design {{modification}} of Rotor 67 {{is carried out}} with a full 3 D inverse method. The blade camber surface is modified to produce a prescribed pressure loading distribution, with the blade tangential thickness distribution and the <b>blade</b> <b>stacking</b> line at midchord kept {{the same as the}} original Rotor 67 design. Because of the inviscid-flow assumption used in the current version of the method, Rotor 67 geometry is modified for use at a design point different from the original design value. A parametric study with the prescribed pressure loading distribution yields the following results. In the subsonic section, smooth pressure loading shapes generally produce blades with well-behaved blade surface pressure distributions. In the supersonic section, the study shows that the strength and position of the passage shock correlate with the characteristics of the blade pressure loading shape. In general, "smooth" prescribed blade pressure loading distributions generate blade designs with reverse cambers which have the effect of weakening the passage shock...|$|R
40|$|A newly {{designed}} rotor was modeled from the well-known radially stacked NASA rotor 37 by applying a three-dimensional shape {{to the original}} <b>blade</b> <b>stacking</b> line. A considerable curvature toward the direction of rotor rotation {{was given to the}} new blade. A three-dimensional numerical model, developed and validated using a commercial computational fluid dynamics Reynolds-averaged Navier―Stokes code, was adopted to predict the flowfield inside the new rotor. Steady-viscous-flow calculations were run at the design speed of the baseline configuration. Compared with rotor 37, the new rotor showed a higher efficiency, mainly due to a three-dimensional modification of the shock structure. At the outer span, the new rotor developed a blade-to-blade shock front located more downstream than in the baseline rotor, with a considerable impact on the flowfield near the casing. Computational fluid dynamics flow visualizations showed a less detrimental shock/boundary-layer/tip-clearance interaction at low-flow operating conditions, with a considerable reduction of the low-momentum-fluid region after the shock...|$|R

The impeller blade angle, discharge hub to shroud width, axial length and <b>blade</b> <b>stacking</b> were systematically changed to achieve an optimum impeller design. Impeller overall efficiency, loss distribution, hub-to-tip flow angle distortion and blade-to-blade flow angle change are among those criteria used to evaluate impeller performance. Two grid sizes, one with 10 K grid points and one with 80 K grid points were used to evaluate grid dependency issues. The effects of grid resolution on the accuracy and turnaround time are discussed.

5000|$|The dagger-axe, or gee (Chinese: 戈; pinyin: gē; Wade-Giles: ko; {{sometimes}} confusingly translated [...] "halberd") {{is a type}} {{of weapon}} that was in use from Shang dynasty until at least Han dynasty China. It consists of a dagger-shaped blade made of bronze (or later iron) mounted by the tang to a perpendicular wooden shaft: a common Bronze Age infantry weapon, also used by charioteers. Some dagger axes include a spear-point. There is a (rare) variant type with a divided two-part head, consisting of the usual straight blade and a scythe-like blade. Other rarities include archaeology findings with 2 or sometimes 3 <b>blades</b> <b>stacked</b> in line on top of a pole, but were generally thought as ceremonial polearms. Though the weapon saw frequent use in ancient China, the use of the dagger-axe decreased dramatically after the Qin and Han dynasties. The Ji combines the dagger axe with a spear. By the medieval Chinese dynasties, with the decline of chariot warfare, the use of the dagger-axe was almost nonexistent.|$|R
50|$|An optical {{beam dump}} is an optical element used to absorb {{a beam of}} light. Major design {{concerns}} in a beam dump typically include the management and reduction of back reflections and scattering {{as well as the}} dissipation of heat generated by absorption. For low-power systems and less demanding applications, the device {{can be as simple as}} a piece of black velvet or flock paper glued onto a stiff backing, but higher-power beam dumps must often incorporate more elaborate features to avoid back-reflection, overheating, or excessive noise. Dumping the beam with a simple flat surface may scatter unacceptably large amounts of light for some applications, even though the direct reflection may be effectively reduced. To minimize scattering, it is common to use deep, dark cavities lined with an absorbing material to dump the beam. A particularly simple and relatively inexpensive approach is to use a <b>stack</b> of razor <b>blades</b> with the sharp edges facing the beam, so that the spaces between the blades form very deep cavities from which little light escapes.|$|R
2500|$|The American-style cabinet saws {{generally}} {{follow the}} model of the Delta Unisaw, a design that has evolved since 1939. Saws of this general type are made in the USA, Canada, Taiwan, and China. These saws are characterized by a cast iron top on a full-length steel base, square in section, with radiused corners. Two 3/8" [...] deep by 3/4" [...] wide miter slots are located parallel to the blade, one {{to the left of the}} blade and one to the right. The most common type of rip fence mounted to this type of saw is characterized by the standard model made by Biesemeyer (now a subsidiary of Delta). It has a sturdy, steel T-type fence mounted to a steel rail at the front of the saw. It has replaceable laminate faces. American cabinet saws are normally designed to accept a [...] " [...] wide <b>stacked</b> dado <b>blade</b> in addition to a standard saw blade. The most common size of blade is 10" [...] in diameter with a blade arbor diameter of [...] ", but 12" [...] or 14" [...] in diameter with a blade arbor diameter of 1" [...] are found in commercial/industrial sites. American saws normally include an anti-kickback device that incorporates a splitter, toothed anti-kickback pawls and a clear plastic blade cover. American style saws have an easily replaceable insert around the blade in the table top. This allows the use of zero-clearance inserts, which greatly reduce tear out on the bottom of the workpiece. It is common for this type of saw to be equipped with a table extension that increases ripping capacity for sheet goods to 50". The saw blade can tilt to either the left side or right side of the saw, depending on {{the model of}} saw. The original Delta Unisaw and early cabinet saws based on it were all right-tilt units while newer Delta Unisaws and many competitive cabinet saws made after 2000 are left-tilt saws. The switch to left-tilt design is due to a lower perceived propensity for the cut piece to become trapped between the rip fence and blade and kick back when the blade tilts away from the rip fence (left tilt saw) versus towards the rip fence (right tilt saw.) While conceptually simple in design, these saws are highly evolved and are capable of efficient, high volume, precision work.|$|R
40|$|Methods for the {{production}} and detection of shock waves are reviewed with particular emphasis on {{the production}} of shock waves by exploding wires and by the absorption of energy from a pulsed laser system. An exploding wire system is described for the generation of shockwaves in perspex plates. Observation is made using the stress induced bi-refrigence, and 'time integrated' photographs of shock waves are produced. At lower energies the exploding wire produces a mixture of wire vapour and molten droplets. The disintegration of the droplets is shown and {{described in terms of}} the mechanism shown by Lane and Edwards (104) to operate forwater droplets. A modified Kerr cell shutter with an unsymmetric electrode geometry is described with reference to possible use as a fast light shutter for measuring shock wave velocities. A development of this shutter has one of the electrodes in the Kerr cell consisting of a <b>stack</b> of razor <b>blades.</b> Light which has been diffracted from an electrostrictively induced phase grating near the blade edges, has been detected. A number of mechanisms are described which take effect within the modified cell. A system {{for the production}} and detection of shock waves by a Q-switched ruby laser is described. Shock waves are produced in liquids both by electrical breakdown and by evaporation of the surface material from a metal target. Experimental results show the production of shock waves with velocities up to 10 4 m/s in water. The ablation wave produced when the surface of a metal wire is evaporated by a laser has been photographed. This shock wave accelerates as it moves towards the centre of the wire. Finally, the process of stimulated Brillouin scattering is described as the pulsed laser is focused into a liquid. <p...|$|R
40|$|Temperate macroalgal {{forests are}} among the most {{productive}} ecosystems in the world. Acoustic propagation measurements have been used to monitor primary production over broad spatial scales (101 - 103 m) in seagrass meadows, and work is in development to assess the application of acoustics for measuring aggregate production in kelp beds and forests. In addition, scientific echosounders have been used routinely for mapping these benthic habitats and, in some cases, identify dominant species. Further advances in these areas require the development of species-specific acoustic models. However there is little knowledge of the acoustic properties of macroalgae, in part because measuring sound speed in large macroalgae is challenging due to their complex morphology. In this study four different methods are developed and trialled to determine the intrinsic sound speed of Ecklonia radiata tissue based on measurement of the time of flight of an ultrasonic pulse, while compressibility is calculated from density measurements. Direct methods involved lengths of stipe and tightly packed <b>stacks</b> of macroalgae <b>blade</b> tissue. Indirect methods focused on an entire intact macroalga submerged in seawater, and a homogenate solution containing seawater and blended blade tissue. Blade tissue showed a density contrast (relative to seawater) of 1. 23 and a sound speed contrast of 1. 0374 for the stacks. The homogenate solution gave a sound speed contrast of 1. 0424. Stipe tissue density and sound speed were lower. Density contrast was 1. 04 and sound speed contrasts were 1. 0179 (SD= 0. 0025) and 1. 0064 (SD= 0. 0032) depending on the sample. Whole macroalgae had age- and size-dependent densities with an average density contrast of 1. 11 (SD= 0. 09) and showed an average sound speed of 1572. 8 m/s (17. 8 °C) and contrast of 1. 0404 (SD= 0. 0139). Compressibility was higher in stipe than blade tissue, with 3. 924 e- 10 Pa- 1 and 3. 982 e- 10 Pa- 1 for stipes and 3. 209 e- 10 Pa- 1 and 3. 180 e- 10 Pa- 1 for <b>blade</b> in <b>stacks</b> and homogenate respectively. The results show that E. radiata sound speed and density are higher, and compressibility lower, than that of seawater. This is likely related to high concentrations of alginate, and other structural and storage carbohydrates in the macroalgae, and thus may vary seasonally. The differences between tissue types found for all properties reflect the morphology and anatomy of this macroalga, with tightly condensed chloroplast cells in blade tissue and loosely packed structural cells in the stipe. This research provides essential input parameters to numerical models that will enhance acoustic habitat mapping and allow the development of acoustic inverse methods. This may enable the estimation of aggregate primary production over large spatial scales in temperate kelp habitats, thus informing their future management.
