Offloading refers to the use of complementary networks for delivering the data originally targeted for the cellular networks [4].

In addition to <b>spectrum</b> shortage, network <b>congestion</b> is another critical challenge for the cellular networks. Congestion results from the extremely large number of bandwidth-hungry smart devices. To alleviate network congestion, load balancing, which balances data distribution across multiple resources, e.g., multiple macrocells, presents an attractive solution [6]. Thus, offloading, along with load balancing, are used to address spectrum shortage and network congestion issues and they optimize the resource utilization in cellular networks.|$|R

Arising challenges are ever increasing traffic demand, shortage of available <b>spectrum</b> and <b>congestion</b> over wireless systems. On the other hand, network resources such as spectrum and computational capability, are severely under-utilized. With regard to efficient use the available resources, promising trend is to develop heterogeneous networks (HetNets) such that different operators can share their excess capacities among themselves with the previous agreement. The most research done in spectrum sharing is focused only on the network access point. In this thesis work we extend the modelling of the spectrum sharing problem to include all links on the route for a given session.

Addressing an issue of congestion over wireless system different congestion control mechanisms are presented and analyzed enabling a variety of options for managing traffic across the spectra sharing network. These models are generalized to include different pricing mechanisms. Two approaches are taken for analyzing pricing models with congestion control mechanism. First, network nodes are modeled as two-dimensional Markov processes. Since memoryless nature of Markov process imposes restrictions on analyzed system, in order to generalize analysis, averaged non-Markov models are introduced.

A key aspect of these radios is the “cognition” gained through a spectrum scanning process. The benefit of this cognition is apparent and well studied in terms of achieving better communication performance on selected spectrum and detecting the presence of primary users. The benefits in terms of reduced energy consumption in secondary users, however, due to easier channel access and less contention have not been quantified in prior work. On the other hand, spectrum scanning to gain cognition is a power-intensive process and the costs incurred in terms of energy lost need to be accounted for. Thus, {{it is not clear whether}} a cognitive radio-based node would be more energy-efficient than any conventional radio node, and if so, under what circumstances. This focus on energy consumption is particularly important when considering portable communication devices that are energy constrained.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a wireless provider who caters to {{two classes of}} customers, namely primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs). PUs have long term contracts while SUs are admitted and priced according to current availability of excess spectrum. The average rate at which SUs attempt to access the spectrum is a function on the currently advertised price, {{referred to as the}} demand function. We analyze the problem of maximizing the average profit gained by admissions of SUs, when the demand function is unknown. We introduce a new on-line algorithm, called Measurement-based Threshold Pricing (MTP), that requires the optimization of only two parameters, a price and a threshold, whereby SU calls are admitted and charged a fixed price when the channel occupancy is lower than the threshold and rejected otherwise. At each iteration, MTP measures the average arrival rate of SUs corresponding to a certain test price. We prove that these measurements of the secondary demand are sufficient for MTP to converge to a local optimal price and corresponding optimal threshold, within a number of measurements that is logarithmic in the total number of possible prices. We further provide an adaptive version of MTP that adjusts to time-varying demand and establish its convergence properties. We conduct numerical studies showing the convergence of MTP to near-optimal online profit and its superior performance over a traditional reinforcement learning approach.

In this paper, we investigate {{the problem of}} optimal spot pricing of spectrum by a provider {{in the presence of}} both non-elastic primary users, with long-term commitments, and opportunistic, elastic secondary users. We first show that optimal pricing can be formulated as an infinite horizon average reward problem and solved using stochastic dynamic programming. Next, we investigate the design of efficient single pricing policies. We provide numerical and analytical evidences that static pricing policies do not perform well in such settings (in sharp contrast to settings where all the users are elastic). On the other hand, we prove that deterministic threshold pricing achieves optimal profit amongst all single-price policies and performs close to global optimal pricing. We characterize the profit regions of different pricing policies, {{as a function of the}} arrival rate of primary users. Under certain reasonable assumptions on the demand function, we prove that the profit region of threshold pricing is optimal and independent of the specific form of the demand function, and that it includes the profit region of static pricing. In addition, we show that the profit function of threshold pricing is unimodal in price. We determine a restricted interval in which the optimal threshold lies. These properties enable very efficient computation of the optimal threshold policy, which is far faster than that of the global optimal policy.

The purpose of this thesis {{is to find the}} benefits of using spectrum commons for frequency assignment in Thailand. To satisfy this purpose, four main contributions are provided: 1) a framework to understand the institution of spectrum commons and its application to Thailand, 2) an approach to explain {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} spectrum commons, 3) an exploration of the use of a framework for a benefit and cost analysis to valuate the spectrum commons, and 4) possible implications of using spectrum commons in Thailand. These contributions will serve as information for a regulator to make better-grounded decisions on frequency assignment and on whether to license or unlicense spectrum. The thesis uses history, content analysis, and literature critique as its main sources. The content analysis and literature critique are based on the public consultation in 2008 by the European Radio Spectrum Policy Group. It addresses the aspects of a European approach to the collective use of spectrum and identifies the advantages and disadvantages of spectrum commons. To describe the institution of spectrum commons, the property rights regimes by Schlager and Ostrom (1982) are used. This is based on three economic institutions originally described by Kiser and Ostrom (1982) and later adopted by Field (1992). This information is examined, together with the benefit and cost analysis based on the research by Campbell and Brown (2003), Indepen (2006), and Sweet et al. (2002). Data from this examination contribute to defining a framework that can be used to valuate spectrum commons in Thailand. The institution of spectrum commons in Thailand comprises technical and non-technical aspects. The technical aspects are power limitation and use of the specified frequency band, and the non-technical ones are frequency sharing among users and no endowed rights to request compensation from interfering parties. The advantages of spectrum commons are lower entry barriers for new entrants, a reduction in administration work (such as defining property rights to use frequency, auction process, etc.), and enhancing social benefits. These attributes contribute to increasing the potential for innovation and stimulating further demand for new technologies. The main disadvantage of spectrum commons is irreversibility after <b>spectrum</b> assignment, <b>congestion,</b> and limited quality of service. Even these eventual limitations can be solved with the advancement of technology, while the threats, e. g., lack of innovation while sharing with licensed services, are questionable. The thesis argues that spectrum commons has more strengths and opportunities than weaknesses and threats. In order to implement the spectrum commons and valuate the usefulness of this approach in practice, a framework of benefits and costs is defined. The output of this thesis can be used as information for regulators to decide whether the frequency should be licensed or unlicensed and to evaluate the consequences of implementing spectrum commons...|$|R
