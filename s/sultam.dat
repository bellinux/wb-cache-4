When an acrylate substituted {{with the}} Oppolzer’s <b>sultam</b> reacted with various aldehydes in the presence of DABCO catalyst, optically pure 1,3-dioxan-4-ones were afforded with cleavage of the auxiliary (67-98% yield, >99% ee).

50|$|<b>Sultams</b> are cyclic sulfonamides. Bioactive <b>sultams</b> {{include the}} {{antiinflammatory}} ampiroxicam and the anticonvulsant sultiame. <b>Sultams</b> are prepared analogously to other sulfonamides, {{allowing for the}} fact that sulfonic acids are deprotonated by amines. They are often prepared by one-pot oxidation of disulfides or thiols linked to amines. An alternative synthesis of <b>sultams</b> involves initial preparation of a linear sulfonamide, followed by intramolecular C-C bond formation (i.e. cyclization), a strategy that was used in the synthesis of a sultam-based deep-blue emitter for organic electronics.|$|R

50|$|Camphorsultam is {{synthesized}} by {{reduction of}} camphorsulfonylimine. This reaction was originally performed as a catalytic hydrogenation using Raney Nickel, but the modern preparation instead uses lithium aluminium hydride for the reduction. These reductive methods are stereoselective: although both the endo and exo diastereomeric forms are theoretically possible, only the exo isomer is actually produced due to steric effects {{of one of the}} methyl groups. Camphorsultam {{is often referred to as}} Oppolzer's <b>sultam</b> in reference to Wolfgang Oppolzer and colleagues, who developed the lithium aluminium hydride approach to this compound and pioneered its use in asymmetric synthesis.|$|E
50|$|Camphorsultam, or Oppolzer's <b>sultam,</b> is {{a typical}} chiral {{auxiliary}} in the asymmetric synthesis.In the total synthesis of manzacidin B, Ohfune group utilized camphorsultam to construct the core oxazoline ring asymmetrically. Comparing with oxazolidinone as the chiral auxiliary, camphorsultam had a significant (2S,3R)-selectivity.Camphorsultam also acts as a chiral auxiliary in Michael addition. Lithium base promoted stereoselective Michael addition of thiols to N-mcthacryloylcamphorsultam produced the corresponding addition products in high diastereoselectivity.Camphorsultam {{was used as a}} chiral auxiliary for the asymmetric Claisen rearrangement. In the presence of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) used as a polymerization inhibitor, a toluene solution of the adduct between geraniol and camphorsultam was heated in a sealed tube at 140 °C, to provide mainly the (2R,3S)-isomer as the major rearrangement product in 72% yield, securing the two contiguous stereocenters including the quaternary carbon.|$|E

He was succeeded by his nephew As'ad Pasha al-Azm who reigned between 1743 and 1757, and was considered the greatest governor of Damascus in Ottoman times.

However, the -substituted 4 -isopropylidene -sultam is relatively unreactive and undergoes alkaline hydrolysis with C–N fission leaving the strained 4 -membered -sultam ring intact.
