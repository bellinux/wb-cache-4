50|$|A third type of {{underway}} replenishment is {{vertical replenishment}} (VERTREP). In this method, a helicopter lifts cargo from the <b>supplying</b> <b>ship</b> and lowers {{it to the}} receiving ship. The main advantage of this method is that the ships {{do not need to}} be close to each other, so there is little risk of collision; VERTREP is also used to supplement and speed stores transfer between ships conducting CONREP. However, the maximum load and transfer speeds are both limited by the capacity of the helicopter, and fuel and other liquids cannot be supplied via VERTREP.|$|E
50|$|The {{alongside}} connected replenishment (CONREP) is {{a standard}} method of transferring liquids such as fuel and fresh water, along with ammunition and break bulk goods. The <b>supplying</b> <b>ship</b> holds a steady course and speed, generally between 12 and 16 knots. Moving at speed lessens relative motion due to wave action and allows better control of heading. The receiving ship then comes alongside the supplier {{at a distance of}} approximately 30 yards. A gunline, pneumatic line thrower, or shot line is fired from the supplier, which is used to pull across a messenger line. This line is used to pull across other equipment such as a distance line, phone line, and the transfer rig lines. As the command ship of the replenishment operation, the supply ship provides all lines and equipment needed for the transfer. Additionally, all commands are directed from the supply ship.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} type of replenishment, {{rarely used}} today, is [...] fueling. In this method, the receiving ship follows {{directly behind the}} <b>supplying</b> <b>ship.</b> The fuel-supplying ship throws a marker buoy into {{the sea and the}} receiving ship takes station with it. Then the delivering ship trails a hose in the water that the fuel-receiving ship retrieves and connects to. This method is more limited, as only one transfer rig can be set up. However, it is safer, as a slight course error will not cause a collision. US Navy experiments with Cuyama and [...] led the Navy to conclude that the rate of fuel transfer was too slow to be useful. But the astern method of refueling was used by the German and Japanese Navies during World War II; and this method was still used by the Soviet navy for many decades thereafter.|$|E

40|$|Integrated Full Electric Propulsion (IFEP) marine {{power systems}} offer {{increased}} design flexibility and operational economy by <b>supplying</b> <b>ship</b> propulsion and service loads {{from a common}} electrical system. Predicting the behaviour of IFEP systems through simulation is important in reducing the design risk. However, the prevalence of power electronics {{and the potential for}} interaction between large electrical and mechanical systems introduce significant simulation challenges. This paper presents an integrated simulation tool, which brings together electrical, mechanical, thermal and hydrodynamic models, facilitating a holistic simulation capability. Approaches adopted for model validation and computational efficiency together with two case studies are discussed...|$|E

It consisted of four medium-sized <b>supply</b> <b>ships</b> and five escort craft. All four supply vessels and one of the escorts were hit with bombs and three of the <b>supply</b> <b>ships</b> were left on fire, the largest having run aground.
