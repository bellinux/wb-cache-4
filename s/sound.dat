5|$|A MOS Technology 6502 {{chip that}} {{operates}} at 894kHz generates the <b>sound</b> effects, and a speech synthesizer by Votrax generates Q*bert's incoherent expressions. The audio system uses 128B of random-access memory and 4KB of erasable programmable {{read only memory}} to store the <b>sound</b> data and code to implement it. Like other Gottlieb games, the <b>sound</b> system was thoroughly tested to ensure it would handle daily usage. In retrospect, audio engineer David Thiel commented that such testing minimized time available for creative designing.|$|E
5|$|A {{chattering}} <b>sound</b> {{is made by}} rapidly gnashing the teeth, and {{is generally}} a sign of warning. Guinea pigs tend to raise their heads when making this <b>sound.</b>|$|E
5|$|A <b>sound</b> film is {{a motion}} picture with {{synchronized}} <b>sound,</b> or <b>sound</b> technologically coupled to image, {{as opposed to a}} silent film. The first known public exhibition of projected <b>sound</b> films took place in Paris in 1900, but decades passed before <b>sound</b> motion pictures were made commercially practical. Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early sound-on-disc systems, and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate. Innovations in sound-on-film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology, which took place in 1923.|$|E
30|$|Auscultation of {{pulmonary}} <b>sounds</b> provides invaluable clinical {{information on}} the health of the respiratory system. It is known in medicine that <b>sounds</b> emanating from the respiratory system are correlated with the underlying pulmonary pathology. The changes in lung structure change the spectrum of <b>sounds</b> heard over the chest wall. In addition to the typical <b>sounds</b> associated with the breathing process, extra or additional <b>sounds</b> are heard over the normal pulmonary <b>sounds.</b> These additional <b>sounds</b> are called adventitious pulmonary <b>sounds</b> and detection of these adventitious <b>sounds</b> {{is an important part of}} the respiratory examination that allows the physician to detect some pathological diseases.|$|R
5000|$|Respiratory <b>sounds,</b> breath <b>sounds,</b> or lung <b>sounds</b> {{refer to}} the {{specific}} <b>sounds</b> generated by the movement of air through the respiratory system. These may be easily audible or identified through auscultation of the respiratory system through the lung fields with a stethoscope {{as well as from}} the spectral chacteristics of lung <b>sounds.</b> These include normal breath <b>sounds</b> and adventitious or [...] "added" [...] <b>sounds</b> such as rales, wheezes, pleural friction rubs, stertor and stridor.|$|R
50|$|At beginning, {{therapists}} {{will ask}} patients {{to focus on}} breathing single-syllable <b>sounds</b> only. The effect of this technique is enhanced if therapists can guide patients to produce the <b>sounds</b> with their natural breathing patterns that help them relax, such as yawning, signing, or cleaning voices. Later on, patients will be encouraged to develop the breathing <b>sounds</b> into pitched <b>sounds.</b> Hand movement {{may be used to}} help patients synchronize syllable <b>sounds</b> with exhaling. Usually, the single-syllable <b>sounds</b> begin from vowels to consonants. However, it is also suggested that the procedure should be from bilabial <b>sounds</b> (i.e. /m/, /b/), tongue-tip <b>sounds</b> (i.e. /n/, /d/), to tongue-base <b>sounds</b> (i.e. /g/, /k/).|$|R
5|$|Along with Organized Noize, {{other members}} of the Dungeon Family worked on the album, {{including}} Goodie Mob, Mr. DJ, Debra Killings, and Society of Soul. The album was mixed at <b>Sound</b> on <b>Sound</b> in New York City, Bosstown, D.A.R.P. Studios, Tree <b>Sound,</b> and Studio LaCoCo in Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|Avex Trax hired Japanese {{musician}} Max Matsuura {{to produce}} the entire record, alongside with Hamasaki and Japanese musician Naoto Suzuki's help, while Hamasaki wrote every song on the album. Recording sessions were handled at Prime <b>Sound</b> Studio, Studio <b>Sound</b> Dali, and Onkio Haus in Tokyo, Japan, and at Soundtrack Studios in New York City, United States; the final material was then mixed at Studio <b>Sound</b> Dali and Conway Studios in Los Angeles, California, and mastered by Eddy Schreyer at Oasis Masterings.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{may affect}} {{specific}} sounds or the entire phonological system. <b>Sound</b> change can consist of {{the replacement of}} one speech <b>sound</b> or phonetic feature by another, {{the complete loss of}} the affected <b>sound,</b> or even the introduction of a new <b>sound</b> in a place where there had been none. <b>Sound</b> changes can be conditioned in which case a <b>sound</b> is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. <b>Sound</b> change is usually assumed to be regular, which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, <b>sound</b> changes can sometimes be sporadic, affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a chain shift in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the Germanic languages when the <b>sound</b> change known as Grimm's law affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant * became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous * in turn became /p/, and the previous * became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why Italic languages such as Latin have p in words like pater and pisces, whereas Germanic languages, like English, have father and fish.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} Experiment 2 {{replicate}} the main findings of Experiment 1. Listeners treat looming <b>sounds</b> and close <b>sounds</b> with perceptual priority. They perceive them as moving faster than receding and distant <b>sounds</b> of equal speed. Listeners also have greater speed discrimination for looming <b>sounds</b> than for receding <b>sounds</b> {{even when they}} only hear <b>sounds</b> that travel in one direction.|$|R

50|$|Villchur {{worked with}} many {{volunteer}} subjects {{to analyze the}} various types of hearing loss. He discovered that traditional hearing aids of the day amplified loud <b>sounds</b> to the same extent as quiet <b>sounds.</b> He quickly realized, however, that quiet <b>sounds</b> needed more amplification than loud <b>sounds.</b> In fact, loud <b>sounds</b> might need no amplification at all. Many of his subjects complained that their hearing aids made soft <b>sounds</b> audible, but amplified moderately loud <b>sounds</b> to a painful level.|$|R

5|$|In October 1927, Warner Bros. {{released}} The Jazz Singer, {{the first}} feature-length talking picture. Its success prompted Hollywood {{to convert from}} silent to <b>sound</b> film production en masse. The Radio Corporation of America (RCA) controlled an advanced optical sound-on-film system, RCA Photophone, recently developed by General Electric. However, its hopes of joining in the anticipated boom in <b>sound</b> movies faced a major hurdle: Warner Bros. and Fox, Hollywood's other vanguard <b>sound</b> studios, were already financially and technologically aligned with ERPI, a subsidiary of AT's Western Electric division. The industry's two largest major studios, Paramount and Loew's/MGM, with two other studios Universal and First National, were poised to contract with ERPI for <b>sound</b> conversion as well.|$|E
