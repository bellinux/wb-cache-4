5000|$|Billingsgate Island {{was a large}} {{fishing village}} located in Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts. Billingsgate became its own town with its own {{baseball}} team, a school and more than thirty homes. [...] Before {{the construction of the}} Billingsgate Island light, there was another lighthouse, but it was also destroyed in a storm. In the storm that destroyed the light in 1915, all residents fled Billingsgate before the storm came, floating all of their homes and personal belongings across the bay. The only two people left on the island as the storm passed were the lighthouse keeper and the shellfish keeper who ended up dying in the flood. What is left of Billingsgate Island is only visible at low tide. Most of what is left on Billingsgate Island was either later torn down in the 1930s and 1940s or destroyed by coastal erosion. Billingsgate Island is commonly referred to as Mini-Atlantis because it was once a community where people lived but is now underwater. The Billingsgate fishing community was known for fishing and capturing Sea Bass, Tuna and whale fishing. Currently Billingsgate is only accessible by boat and at low tide. Today, it is used as a picnic area and for <b>shell-fishing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Castro Creek is a creek in Richmond, California in {{the western}} part of the city {{adjacent}} to the Chevron Oil Refinery. Wildcat Creek drains into it directly and though other Wildcat Marsh tributaries into Castro Cove of San Pablo Bay. The creek drains from the drainage basin of the surrounding area and was once part of the channel that separated the island of Point Richmond with the mainland. The stream is waterway is named after Don Víctor Castro the owner of the area when it was Rancho San Pablo. The Chevron Richmond Refinery dumps wastewater into the creek routinely 500 yards north of the confluence with Wildcat Creek and also in a drainage. Other waste may only be dumped into the creek through a drainage ditch on Castro Street during high intensity rainfall. Castro Creek is a fishing, <b>shell-fishing,</b> and recreation area. Its estuarine habitat is essential habitat for several endangered species. The creek is also a fish spawning and migration center. The refinery creates [...] per day of byproduct refinery process water, cooling water, storm water and other wastewater which it discharges into Castro Creek, Castro Cove, Wildcat Marsh, and San Pablo Bay. Castro Cove has become very polluted from 85 years of unbridled discharge of waste waters with PAHs and mercury from the Chevron Oil Refinery and is scheduled to begin cleanup efforts in summer 2007.|$|E

While the ability of social conflict to constrain aquaculture has been demonstrated in a few cases, its current potential to constrain aquaculture on Cape Cod had not been established prior to this study. This study was based on information gathered from town records and public hearings related to proposed aquaculture ventures. In addition, town officials were interviewed to obtain additional information related to cases. The {{finding of this study}} is that private riparian proprietors, and interests in <b>shell-fishing</b> tend to constrain aquaculture on Cape Cod today.

40|$|The New Bedford Harbor Superfund Site {{in southeastern}} Massachusetts {{includes}} the shallow northern {{reaches of the}} Acushnet River estuary through the commercial port of New Bedford and adjacent areas of Buzzards Bay. The sediments in the harbor are contaminated {{with high levels of}} PCBs and heavy metals from the industrial development surrounding the harbor. From the 1940 s through the 1970 s, electrical capacitor manufacturing plants discharged PCBs into New Bedford Harbor and its estuaries. In the mid- 1970 s EPA sampling identified PCBs in the river and harbor sediments greater than 100, 000 mg/kg. In 1979, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health prohibited fishing and <b>shell-fishing</b> from the river and harbor due to the high levels of PCB contamination found in the harbor and in the seafood from the area. The site was included on the National Priorities List (NPL) in September 1983, as one of the hottest PCB sites in the United States. In September 1998, after years of study and public debate, EPA selected a cleanup remedy that involved the dredging and containment of approximately 170 acres of PCB contaminated sediment. The principal goals of the project were the reduction in health risks from consumption of PCB-contaminated local seafood and from exposure to contaminated shoreline sediments, and the improvement of water quality in the marine ecosystem. The prescribed PCB cleanup standards for the sediment ranged from 1 mg/kg shoreline areas immediately adjacent to residential properties, up to 50 mg/kg in sediment in remote salt marshes not readily accessible to the public. Removal of sediments to achieve the cleanup standards requires mechanical or hydraulic dredging of more than 800, 000 cubic yards of material. Correlation of analytical data and sediment cores shows a relationship between the presence of PCB contamination and distribution of the organic layer (OL) in the river. The relationship exists {{because of the nature of}} the contamination and its affinity for organic material. Sediment cores have been collected to refine the modeled sediment removal maps and guide target depths for dredging...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} archaeologists have {{suggested}} that significant climatic change with environmental and social consequences occurred between 1000 and 400 {{years ago in the}} Indo-Pacific region. We investigate this premise by examining the archaeological record of changes in hunter-gatherer economies in three geographically distinct coastal regions of tropical northern Australia. These case studies support the argument that Aboriginal mollusc exploitation reflects the altered local ecological habitats that accompanied broader coastal environmental change over the last few thousand years. Overlap between the phases and timing of climatic and behavioural changes within each region suggests that, given regional variation in the nature and of these changes, there was an associated human response to late Holocene climatic variability. These case studies establish that archaeological and environmental evidence mutually support the argument for climate change influencing cultural change in northern Australia. We suggest that, while a direct physical link between environmental change and the interpretations of significant cultural change in the archaeological record have yet to be demonstrated unambiguously in this region, the analysis of mollusc exploitation has the potential to provide the direct link that is currently missing between changes in climate, environment and human responses over the last millennium. Archaeological sites have the potential to act as archives that record significant information on palaeoclimatic conditions to augment standard pollen and coral core palaeoclimate indicators (Sandweiss 2003). This becomes particularly useful in areas where few standard palaeoenvironmental studies exist, as is the case for the tropical north Australian coast, especially for the Late Holocene period. Some archaeologists argue that, in the Indo-Pacific region, significant climatic change between 1000 and 400 years ago had considerable environmental and social consequences. Most of these studies have dealt with horticulturalist societies, however, and the impact on hunter gatherer societies is less-well studied (cf. Haberle and David 2004). In tropical north Australia, radiometric dating indicates that substantial changes occurred in the <b>shell-fishing</b> practices of hunter-gatherer groups after approximately 1000 calibrated years ago (Bourke 2003, 2004; Brockwell et al. 2005; Faulkner 2006; Faulkner and Clarke 2004; Hiscock 1997, 1999). This paper presents an over-view of the archaeological record of changes in hunter-gatherer economic and social practices in three geographically distinct regions of tropical northern Australia (Figure 1). This is done so within the context of what is known of significant phases of climate change in order to explore the relationship between human behaviour and climate change in the late Holocene...|$|E
