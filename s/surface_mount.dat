5|$|The logic board, {{the central}} circuit {{board of the}} computer, {{was based on the}} Macintosh SE design. Its size, however, was reduced using <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> {{technology}} to 9×5inches (23×13cm), half the size of the SE board. This redesign, and the absence of expansion slots, kept manufacturing costs low. This lack of expansion abilities, along with the small screen size and Macintosh's popularity in the burgeoning field of desktop publishing led to such oddities as video displays that connected through the SCSI port by users seeking to connect a larger full- or dual-page display to their Mac. The Classic design was used once more in 1991 for the Classic II, which succeeded the Classic and replaced the Macintosh SE/30.|$|E
25|$|Small, cheap {{discoidal}} ceramic capacitors {{have existed}} since the 1930s, {{and remain in}} widespread use. Since the 1980s, <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> packages for capacitors have been widely used. These packages are extremely small and lack connecting leads, allowing them to be soldered directly {{onto the surface of}} printed circuit boards. <b>Surface</b> <b>mount</b> components avoid undesirable high-frequency effects due to the leads and simplify automated assembly, although manual handling is made difficult due to their small size.|$|E
25|$|Fuses {{designed}} for soldering to {{a printed circuit}} board have radial or axial wire leads. <b>Surface</b> <b>mount</b> fuses have solder pads instead of leads.|$|E

Such closers mount inside a pocket {{in the door}} frame or are mounted in the floor directly under the pivot point and are completely concealed.|$|R

For added support, <b>surface</b> <b>mounts</b> can also include triangular brackets, also referred to as gusset plates, to reinforce the connection between the flange and tubing. <b>Surface</b> <b>mounts</b> with this extra support are called gusset <b>mounts.</b> <b>Surface</b> and gusset <b>mounts</b> are used to secure a bike rack into an existing piece of concrete.|$|R
25|$|From the 1980s small <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> parts {{have been}} used {{increasingly}} instead of through-hole components; {{this has led to}} smaller boards for a given functionality and lower production costs, but with some additional difficulty in servicing faulty boards.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to their excellent electrical properties, PPS film capacitors can withstand temperatures up to 270nbsp&°C without damaging the film quality, so that PPS film capacitors are suitable for <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> devices (SMD), and can tolerate the increased reflow soldering temperatures for lead-free soldering mandated by the RoHS 2002/95/EC directive.|$|E
25|$|Thick film {{resistors}} {{became popular}} during the 1970s, and most SMD (<b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> device) resistors today are of this type. The resistive element of thick films is 1000 times thicker than thin films, but the principal difference {{is how the}} film {{is applied to the}} cylinder (axial resistors) or the surface (SMD resistors).|$|E

25|$|Thermal stress {{during the}} {{soldering}} process {{can change the}} capacitance value of leaded film capacitors by 1% to 5% from initial value, for example. For <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> devices, the soldering process may change the capacitance value {{by as much as}} 10%. The dissipation factor and insulation resistance of film capacitors may also be changed by the above-described external factors, particularly by moisture absorption in high humidity climates.|$|E
25|$|N scale {{locomotives}} are {{powered by}} DC motors which accept {{a maximum of}} 12 V DC. In traditional DC control, {{the speed of the}} train is determined by the amount of voltage supplied to the rails. The direction of the train is determined by the polarity of the power to the rails. Since the end of the 20th century, an increasing number of enthusiasts have started using digital train control systems to determine the speed and direction of their trains. This has in part been made possible by <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> technology and new motors that draw very little current (typically 0.2 amps). The most popular digital control systems used in N scale model railways are NMRA-DCC and Selectrix.|$|E

25|$|While Heath/Zenith's {{computer}} {{business was}} successful, {{the growing popularity}} of home computers as a hobby hurt the company because many customers began writing computer programs instead of assembling Heathkits. While their assembly was still an interesting and educational hobby, kits were no longer less expensive than preassembled products; BYTE reported in 1984 that the kit version of the Z-150 IBM PC compatible cost $100 more than the preassembled computer from some dealers, but needed about 20 hours and soldering skills to assemble. The continuation of the integration trend (printed circuit boards, integrated circuits, etc.), and mass production of electronics (especially computer manufacturing overseas and plug-in modules) eroded the basic Heathkit business model. Assembling a kit might still be fun, but it could no longer save much money. The switch to <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> components and LSI ICs finally made it impossible for the home assembler to construct an electronic device for significantly less money than assembly line factory products. As sales of its kits dwindled during the decade, Heath relied on its training materials and a new venture in home automation and lighting products to stay afloat. When Zenith eventually sold ZDS to Groupe Bull in 1989, Heathkit was included in the deal.|$|E

[...] Components can be supplied mounted on carrier tapes. <b>Surface</b> <b>mount</b> components can be about one-quarter to one-tenth of the size and weight of through-hole components, and passive components much cheaper; prices of semiconductor <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> devices (SMDs) are determined more by the chip itself than the package, with little price advantage over larger packages.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} both {{experimental and}} analytical investigations undertaken to evaluate bond characteristics of near <b>surface</b> <b>mounted</b> carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) bars. A total of eight concrete beams, strengthened with near <b>surface</b> <b>mounted</b> CFRP bars were tested under monotonic static loading. Different embedment lengths are studied {{to determine the}} development length of the FRP reinforcement. The performance of two different adhesives used to bond the bars to the surrounding concrete is examined. A general methodology to evaluate the development length of near <b>surface</b> <b>mounted</b> FRP bars of different configurations and types of fibers is presented. A quantitative criterion governing debonding failure is established. The proposed bond model assumes linear elastic behavior for the concrete, adhesive and the near <b>surface</b> <b>mounted</b> (NSM) FRP bars, following the same philosophy of the ACI provisions for bond analysis and design. The proposed analytical model is validated by comparing the predicted values to test results {{as well as to}} non-linear finite element modelling. The influence of key parameters, including the thickness of the adhesive cover, groove width, groove spacing and internal steel reinforcement configuration are discussed...|$|R
