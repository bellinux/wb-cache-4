25|$|Some live {{seeds are}} dormant and need more time, and/or {{need to be}} {{subjected}} to <b>specific</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> before they will germinate. Seed dormancy can originate {{in different parts of the}} seed, for example, within the embryo; in other cases the seed coat is involved. Dormancy breaking often involves changes in membranes, initiated by dormancy-breaking signals. This generally occurs only within hydrated seeds. Factors affecting seed dormancy include the presence of certain plant hormones, notably abscisic acid, which inhibits germination, and gibberellin, which ends seed dormancy. In brewing, barley seeds are treated with gibberellin to ensure uniform seed germination for the production of barley malt.|$|E

Carl Sauer criticized the premature generalizations resulting from bias in environmentalism in 1924.

This session is meant to act as a control condition, meaning that the environment is enriched for the purpose of the behavior not occurring.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Herrnstein's {{mathematical}} {{statement of}} the law of effect improves on Skinner's view of rein-forcement by asserting (a) that response rate varies hy-perbolically with reinforcement rate and (b) that re-sponding is governed not only by reinforcement obtained for responding but also by reinforcement obtained from all other concurrent sources. Data from infrahuman organisms and from humans in laboratory and clinical situations support this new view of reinforcement. Clin-ically, Herrnstein's equation requires a broader envi-ronmental approach to conceptualizing cases and to applying reinforcement principles in therapy. The equation can help clinicians design treatment regimens more efficiently, and it suggests four new intervention strategies that may be especially useful in difficult cases, for example, when standard procedures are contra-indicated or in environments that already supply large amounts of reinforcement. During the past two decades, research in basic behavioral science has become increasingly con-cerned with formal, that is, mathematical, descrip-tions of behavior. Very recently, a number of fairly complete formalisms have been proposed that ac-count remarkably well for certain features of be-havior under <b>specific</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>condition...</b>|$|R

Further characterization of the isolated enzymes has showed that this enzyme is most active at pH 6. 0 and at the optimized temperature of 50 0 C. The purified chitinase exhibited high degree of antifungal activity particularly by degrading their cell wall components of plant pathogens Macrophomina phaseolina (69. 0 %) and Rhizoctonia solani (52. 0 %). It infers that the chitinase produced by B. subtilis could play an important role for biopesticidal activity...|$|R

2500|$|Rare Earth proponents {{argue that}} simple life may be common, though complex life {{requires}} <b>specific</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> to arise. Critics consider life could arise on a moon {{of a gas}} giant, however the requirements and their complexity increase rather, if volcanicity is absolutely required for life. The moon must have stresses to induce tidal heating, but not so dramatic as seen on Jupiter's Io. The paradox here is the moon is within the gas giant's intense radiation belts, sterilizing any biodiversity before it can get established. Dirk Schulze-Makuch argues {{that there is no}} evidence to support this conclusion, hypothesizing alternative biochemistries as a method for complex life to arise in completely alien conditions. While Rare Earth proponents argue that only microbial extremophiles could exist in subsurface habitats beyond Earth, some argue that complex life can also arise in these environments. Examples of extremophile animals such as the Hesiocaeca methanicola, an animal that inhabits ocean floor methane clathrates substances more commonly found in the outer Solar System, the tardigrades which can survive in the vacuum of space or Halicephalobus mephisto which exists in crushing pressure, scorching temperatures and extremely low oxygen levels 3.6 kilometres deep in the Earth's crust, are sometimes cited by critics as complex life capable of thriving in [...] "alien" [...] environments. Jill Tarter counters the classic counterargument that these species adapted to these environments rather than arose in them, by suggesting that we cannot assume conditions for life to emerge which are not actually known. There are suggestions that complex life could arise in sub-surface conditions which may be similar to those where life may have arisen on Earth, such as the tidally heated subsurfaces of Europa or Enceladus. Ancient circumvental ecosystems such as these support complex life on Earth such as Riftia pachyptila that exist completely independent of the surface biosphere.|$|E

40|$|Microtubules (MTs) are {{involved}} in key processes in plant cells, including cell division, growth and development. MT-interacting proteins modulate MT dynamics and organization, mediating functional and structural interaction of MTs with other cell structures. In addition to conventional microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) in plants, {{there are many other}} MT-binding proteins whose primary function is not related to the regulation of MTs. This review focuses on enzymes, chaperones, or proteins primarily involved in other processes that also bind to MTs. The MT-binding activity of these multifunctional MAPs is often performed only under <b>specific</b> <b>environmental</b> or physiological <b>conditions,</b> or they bind to MTs only as components of a larger MT-binding protein complex.

40|$|Organismal {{development}} and many cell biological processes are organized in a modular fashion, where regulatory molecules form groups with many interactions within {{a group and}} few interactions between groups. Thus, the activity of elements within a module depends little on elements outside of it. Modularity facilitates the production of heritable variation and of evolutionary innovations. There is no consensus on how modularity might evolve, especially for modules in development. We show that modularity can increase in gene regulatory networks as a byproduct of specialization in gene activity. Such specialization occurs after gene regulatory networks are selected to produce new gene activity patterns that appear in a specific body structure or under a <b>specific</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>condition.</b> Modules that arise after specialization in gene activity comprise genes that show concerted changes in gene activities. This and other observations suggest that modularity evolves because it decreases interference between different groups of genes. Our work can explain the appearance and maintenance of modularity through a mechanism that is not contingent on environmental change. We also show how modularity can facilitate co-option, the utilization of existing gene activity to build new gene activity patterns, a frequent feature of evolutionary innovations...|$|R
40|$|Calcium oxalate patinas {{have been}} sampled on {{architectural}} elements of two ancient churches located on Torcello Island (Venetian Lagoon) and subsequently analysed. The site {{had been selected}} presenting patinas of exceptional amount and thickness, elsewhere generally found as thin alteration layers covering stone surfaces or within black crusts on monuments in urban environments. Optical and mineralogical analyses suggest that these patinas are {{not the result of}} a simple deposition process, but originate as surface “transformations” of the substrate, and are mainly composed of dihydrate calcium oxalate (weddellite) and gypsum. Among the experimental techniques, isotope analyses (C and S) have been specifically carried out aiming at achieving a better understanding of their origin and possible causes of formation. The observed carbon isotopic fingerprint reveals in fact a strong biological fractionation recorded in the oxalate patina (δ 13 C ranging from - 22. 3 ‰ to - 28. 0 ‰), almost exclusively attributable to C 3 pathway photosynthesis processes. Slightly negative sulphur isotope ratio values seem to be inversely correlated with patina exposure to atmospheric agents and pollutants.

40|$|Data {{collected}} on birth and weaning weight traits of beef cattle calves {{over the period}} of 1968 to 1992 with varying levels of Angus and Charolais genes, ranging from 0 % to 75 %, were analysed to determine possible optimum breeding levels for birth weight (BW), weaning weight (WW) and pre-weaning average daily gain (ADG), fitting a unitrait animal model. The estimated heritabilities were used to predict direct (DBV) and maternal breeding values (MBV) for each animal. Best Linear Unbiased Estimates (BLUEs), DBVs and MBVs per genetic group estimated were regressed on proportions of Charolais and Angus breeding. The BLUEs of the traits increased with increasing proportion of Charolais, while they decreased with increasing Angus breeding levels. In general, MBVs increased with increasing the proportions of both breeds. The DBVs of the Charolais increased and reached a maximum at 35, 38, and 45 % proportions of Charolais for BW, WW and ADG, respectively. Except for BW, DBVs of WW and ADG decreased as the genetic contribution of the Angus increased.

The present study concerns the development of single and double diode model of solar PV system and ensures the best suited model under <b>specific</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>condition</b> for accurate performance prediction. The information provided in the manufacturers’ data sheet is not sufficient for developing a Simulink based single and double diode models of PV module. These parameters are crucial to predict accurate performance of a PV module. These parameters of the proposed solar PV models have been calculated using an efficient iterative technique. This paper compares the simulation results of both the models with manufacturer’s data sheet to investigate the accuracy and validity. A MATLAB/Simulink based comparative performance analysis of these models under inconsistent atmospheric conditions and the effect of variations in model parameters has been carried out. Despite the simplicity, these models are highly sensitive and respond to a slight variation in temperature and insolation. It is observed that double diode PV model is more accurate under low intensity insolation or shading condition. The performance evaluation of the models under present study will be helpful to understand the I-V curves, which will enable us in predicting the solar PV system power production under variable input conditions...|$|R
