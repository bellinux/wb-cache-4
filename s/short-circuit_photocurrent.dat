40|$|ABSTRACT Thin-film {{structures}} {{can reduce}} the cost of solar power by using inexpensive substrates and a lower quantity and quality of semiconductor material. However, the resulting short optical path length and minority carrier diffusion length necessitates either a high absorption coefficient or excellent light trapping. Semiconducting nanowire arrays have already been shown to have low reflective losses compared to planar semiconductors, but their light-trapping properties have not been measured. Using optical transmission and photocurrent measurements on thin silicon films, we demonstrate that ordered arrays of silicon nanowires increase the path length of incident solar radiation by up to a factor of 73. This extraordinary light-trapping path length enhancement factor is above the randomized scattering (Lambertian) limit (2 n 2 ∼ 25 without a back reflector) and is superior to other light-trappingmethods. By changing the silicon film thickness and nanowire length, we show that there is a competition between improved absorption and increased surface recombination; for nanowire arrays fabricated from 8 µm thick silicon films, the enhanced absorption can dominate over surface recombination, even without any surface passivation. These nanowire devices give efficiencies above 5 %, with <b>short-circuit</b> <b>photocurrents</b> higher than planar control samples...|$|R

Encapsulation with other layered materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride, is a common practice; however, this approach often requires inextricable fabrication processes. Alternatively, it is intriguing to explore methods to control transport properties in the circumstance of no encapsulated layer.

Although there are numbers of experimental investigations to improve the device performance, {{the understanding of the}} detailed process of photoelectric conversion needs to be further improved. In this work, a thorough optoelectronic simulation is employed to figure out how the nanowire diameter, doping concentration, and illumination wavelength affect the photoelectric conversion characteristics of the silicon nanowire array photoelectrodes. We find that two balances should be carefully weighted between optical absorption and photogenerated-carrier collection, along with between <b>short-circuit</b> <b>photocurrent</b> density and open-circuit voltage. For the small-diameter nanowire array photoelectrodes, the overall absorption is higher than that of the larger-diameter ones with the most contribution from the nanowires. However, the substrate shows increasing absorption with increasing illumination wavelength. Higher doping density leads to a larger open-circuit voltage; while lower doping density can guarantee a relatively higher <b>short-circuit</b> <b>photocurrent.</b> To obtain high-light-conversion-efficiency photoelectrodes, the doping density should be carefully chosen with considerations of illumination wavelength and surface recombination. Suppressing the surface recombination velocity can effectively enhance the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>photocurrent</b> (open-circuit voltage) for the lightly (heavily) doped nanowire array photoelectrodes.

With this rapid growth in activity, new concepts and new directions, it {{is becoming more and}} more important to be able to effectively compare technological advances made in different research groups, and between the different competing technologies. In this article it is illustrated how challenging it can be to fairly asses the efficiency of a solar cell. Specific examples of how much of an influence a range of measurement practices can have on the estimated <b>short-circuit</b> <b>photocurrents</b> and efficiencies are shown for a number of the most commonly researched excitonic solar cell concepts. In the worst case scenario, systematic overestimations by a factor of 5 can be made. For completeness, the influence of the light source, and the correct method to properly calibrate a solar simulator and estimate the spectral mismatch factor is also described. The error in calibrating the light source is actually likely to lead to a much smaller variance than the definition of the active area of the solar cell. The undeniable implication is that it is essential for excitonic solar cells to be correctly masked to define the active area, if the measured efficiency is to bear a true resemblance of the device performance.

As there are variations of silicon film thickness and nanowire length, it seems a competition exists between the improved absorption and the increased surface recombination. The results demonstrated when nanowire arrays were made from 8 -μm-thick silicon films, the improved absorption could dominate over the increased surface recombination, even without surface passivation. Meanwhile, the micro-structure and surface chemistry of nanoporous black silicon layer techniques have been studied in detail using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) by Yanfa Yan [31].

Fatima Toor et al. fabricated p-type black silicon solar cells with conversion efficiency of 17.1 %, and they also analyzed the optical and charge carrier collection performance of multi-scale textured surface [32]. They showed that the spectral response at short wavelengths would be improved as the thickness of nanostructured silicon was reduced. While the nanostructured layer thickness are reduced by 60 %, the averaged reflectance of black silicon in solar cell spectrum retains less than 2 %.

The ultrafast excited-state dynamics of cyanin in solution are compared with those of surface-adsorbed cyanin on TiO 2 and ZrO 2 colloids, as well as complexed with Al(III) ions. A transient absorption signal with a risetime of < 100 fs for cyanin-sensitized TiO 2 nanoparticles is assigned to electrons injected from the dye to TiO 2. This signal is fit to a double-exponential decay with time constants of 0. 52 and 67 ps. The 0. 52 ps component is due to trapping of conduction band electrons or to fast direct recombination with the dye cation, while the 67 ps decay is attributed to trap state mediated indirect recombination. In contrast, stimulated emission with a 2. 6 ps decay time is observed for cyanin in solution, cyanin on ZrO 2, and cyanin complexed with Al(III) ions.

40|$|Dye-sensitized {{solar cells}} (DSSCs) are {{a class of}} solar cells of the third generation. DSSCs are cheap and simple to fabricate, exhibit {{flexible}} properties, and are not limited by the Shockley-Queisser limit of semiconductor junction solar cells. The efficiency of DSSCs has reached a very promising 12 % and DSSCs are currently developed for niche applications under low light conditions. Their performances are limited by undesired electron and hole back transfer and quenching of the photoexcited dyes due to dye-dye and dye-substrate interactions. Overcoming these limitations {{is the subject of}} a large research activity worldwide. It is our main hypotheses that a self-assembly scheme based on a metal-organic coordination construction is a valid alternative for the preparation of dye films and that the flexibility in achieving heterogeneous assemblies can be exploited to mitigate the various quenching and current hindering factors. This thesis focuses thus on the development of a layer-by-layer self-assembly method for wet deposition of metal-organic coordination thin films of porphyrin-based dyes and HKUST- 1 (Honk Kong University of Science and Technology) metal-organic framework (MOF) on flat titanium oxide substrates. The bottom-up growth protocol has been verified on the basis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and visible absorption spectroscopy, and allows formation of arbitrary sequences of these molecular components in remarkably uniform and homogeneous layers. A home-made photoelectrochemical cell was used to measure the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>photocurrents</b> generated by the metal-coordinated films. A detailed discussion of the mechanisms reinforcing or hindering the photocurrent generation for various molecular sequences is reported. In particular, it is demonstrated that the HKUST- 1, trimesic acid-based MOF, can be used as a spacer between the porphyrin dyes and the titanium oxide substrate, without sacrificing the dye layer uniformity and density, and that a bi-layer of trimesic acid maximized the photocurrent, balancing the substrate quenching and the HKUST- 1 conductivity. Metal nanoparticles (NPs) that support surface plasmon resonances (SPR) matching with the dye absorption bands can enhance the absorption cross-section in dye films and reinforce the photocurrents. Citrate-stabilised gold and silver NPs were thus electrostatically assembled on aminosilane-modified titanium oxide films, and functionalized for attachment of the metal-organic coordinated dye and spacer sequences. AuNPs of diameter 17 ± 3 nm exhibit a saturation coverage of 30 %, estimated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and lead to a decrease in the photocurrent attributed to the quenching of the dye with the Au interband transitions. A saturation coverage of 2 - 3 % was found for AgNPs of diameter 42 ± 6 nm, and a global SPR enhancement of the photocurrent by a factor 4 was measured. The latter corresponds to a local enhancement of 200. Layer-by-layer self-assembly of heterogeneous metal-organic films is thus well worth considering as alternative dye film in DSSCs, since they afford a high flexibility in tailoring the layered sequence for optimization of the photocurrent generation and further allow introduction of NPs for SPR enhancement...|$|R

A cell sensitized with this compound gives a <b>short-circuit</b> <b>photocurrent</b> density of (6. 50 ± 0. 20) mA cm- 2, an open-circuit voltage of (635 ± 30) mV, and a fill factor of 0. 74 ± 0. 03, which corresponds to an overall conversion efficiency of 3. 05 %. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co.

30|$|A high light-to-electricity {{conversion}} efficiency {{results from a}} large surface area of the mesoporous TiO 2 photoelectrode, on which the dyes can be sufficiently adsorbed. In this study, we introduced zirconia [ZrO 2] nanofibers into the mesoporous titania [TiO 2] photoelectrode. The ZrO 2 nanofibers are prepared by electrospinning. The TiO 2 film composite with ZrO 2 nanofibers creates a larger surface area than the single TiO 2 film, {{in which case the}} amount of dye loading was increased and <b>short-circuit</b> <b>photocurrent</b> density and solar {{conversion efficiency}} are also increased.|$|E
