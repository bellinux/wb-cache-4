5|$|Growing up, Takako Matsu practiced {{piano and}} took vocal {{training}} as a child. Prior to releasing music, she acted in various television drama and plays. In 1996, she acted in the drama Long Vacation, which became very popular in Japan. At the wrap up party of the drama, {{the director of the}} series at that time heard her perform karaoke and suggested that she try singing. Although taken aback and hesitant at first, she later agreed, as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was not a chance that everyone received and because she liked singing; <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> might work out somehow.|$|E

She {{attended}} many different schools throughout her childhood and adolescent years and managed to finish high school at Lassiter High School six months before graduation.

5|$|In April 2011, Lovato {{became a}} {{contributing}} editor for Seventeen magazine, writing an article that described her struggles. In March 2012, MTV aired a documentary, , about her rehab and recovery. She began work on her fourth album the following month. In January 2013, it was reported that Lovato had been living in a sober-living facility in Los Angeles {{for more than a year}} because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was the best way to avoid returning to her addictions and eating disorder. Lovato celebrated the five year anniversary of her sobriety on March 15, 2017. Lovato also started training in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu since 2016.|$|E

5|$|Although Deal was the bassist of the Pixies, {{she wanted}} to play guitar for the Breeders, because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was an easier {{instrument}} to handle when singing at the same time. Deal recruited Josephine Wiggs of Perfect Disaster to be the Breeders' bassist; the two knew each other from when Perfect Disaster had toured with the Pixies in Europe in 1989. Deal wanted Steve Albini to record the album; she had previously worked {{with him on the}} Pixies' Surfer Rosa. She hoped to have Kelley Deal be the Breeders' drummer, but the latter was not able to take time away from her program analyst job. Albini suggested they try Britt Walford of the band Slint instead. Before recording began, Deal, Wiggs, and Walford rehearsed at Wiggs' house in Bedfordshire, England for a week, and then joined Donelly in London to practice more. Albini was involved in the pre-production of the songs, which Donelly found beneficial.|$|E
5|$|In the manga Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Beveridge liked Sasuke's personality, {{particularly}} {{as it was}} presented during his dialogue with Naruto. Reviewing the anime adaptation, Sam Stewart from IGN was particularly impressed by the scenes between Sasuke and Sarada, most notably because of changes in Sasuke's characterization. He highlights that despite acting coldly towards his daughter, he ends up using his body as a shield {{to protect her from}} his enemy. Ken Iikura from Anime Now agreed, pointing out that Sasuke has become a loving husband and father in Boruto, despite retaining some of the dark aspects of his personality. Ikikura noted that Sasuke and Sarada's meeting in Boruto significantly developed both characters. McNulty disliked the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series, because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was initially an one-sided crush on Sakura's part, but she believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden expanded on the bond between the two and their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Stewart praised Sasuke's portrayal as a flawed parent rather than an effortlessly good one, noting that his farewell to Sarada demonstrated his difficulty with being a good father. Another writer from Anime Now, Sarah Nelkin, noted that these episodes helped to develop Sasuke as both a father and a husband, especially when he explains to Sarada that she creates a bond between him and Sakura that persists despite his being frequently absent {{as a result of his}} mission.|$|E
5|$|The character's {{change in}} Part II (Naruto Shippuden) has been praised for {{being one of}} the most {{developed}} ones in the series by Anime News Network's Casey Brienza, as she has become stronger than her Part I (Naruto) counterpart which, was considerably weaker than Naruto and Sasuke. This allows her to take a more active and appealing role in the series. Major praise has been given to her encounters with Sasori and Sasuke owing to her fighting skills and mature reactions, respectively. Sakura's love confession to Naruto in later parts of the series has been commented {{to be one of the}} deepest lines and part of the story arc, for bringing confusion into the mix in regards to whether or not, her love confession claim is as serious as her intention to stop Naruto's suffering. It also came as a surprise as fans wondered what were Sakura's real intention regarding Sasuke who had become a dangerous criminal during such a time in the series. Jason Thompson believes Sakura's feelings were well-handled by Kishimoto. While disliking the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was initially a crush on Sakura's part, Amy McNulty believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden helps to expand the bond between these two as well as their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Sarah Nelkin from Anime Now praised Sakura's development across the series, mostly in late parts of the series due to how she turns into a stronger person as she grows up most notably when she becomes an adult.|$|E

25|$|Rejecting the Marilyn Monroe/Jayne Mansfield {{style of}} {{platinum}} blonde sex-symbolism, because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would narrow her acting options, Dickinson initially allowed studios to lighten her naturally brunette hair to only honey-blonde. She appeared {{early in her}} career mainly in B-movies or Westerns, including Shoot-Out at Medicine Bend (1957), in which she co-starred with James Garner. In the 1958 crime drama Cry Terror!, Dickinson had a supporting role opposite James Mason and Rod Steiger as a femme fatale.|$|E

Haddad revealed that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was her duty to call and wish Al Zoghbi a quick recovery. Al Zoghbi was grateful towards Haddad for putting all the disputes aside. The two artists appeared {{on the cover of}} Zahrat Al Khaleej magazine in an issue that featured a photoshoot of Haddad and Al Zoghbi together. They also began to form a mutual respect for one another.|$|E
25|$|Alexandra {{loved her}} husband and her son deeply but <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was also her duty to help those in need. She embraced wholeheartedly {{charitable}} work, spending her allowance on donations to schools, hospitals and other institutions. Plain and unsophisticated, Alexandra liked simplicity and preferred to dress modestly, avoiding public life. She dedicated her time to religion and to her consuming interest in medicine. Alexandra's pleasant manners made her win many sympathies. She was well liked by her two sisters-in-law Maria Alexandrovna and Alexandra Iosifovna. However, at the Russian court, Alexandra Petrovna's involvement in philanthropy was considered as excessive and she was regarded as a holy fool.|$|E
25|$|Foreign Minister Dick Spring, who was {{leader of}} the Labour Party, advised her not to meet Adams, whose party was linked with the Provisional IRA. However, the Government refused to {{formally}} advise her not to meet with him. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would be wrong, {{in the absence of}} such formal advice, for her as head of state not to meet the local member of parliament during her visit, and was photographed publicly shaking his hand. During her various visits to Northern Ireland, she in fact regularly met politicians of all hues, including David Trimble of the Ulster Unionist Party and John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour Party.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year, she {{was cast}} as Andie Walsh in another successful Hughes film called Pretty In Pink (1986). Ringwald's role as Andie {{went on to}} become one of her most recognizable performances. When first asked to be in Pretty in Pink, Ringwald was reluctant, but after seeing how hard it was for the producers to find a replacement for her, she decided she would portray Andie in the film. Ringwald was offered a role in another John Hughes film called Some Kind of Wonderful (1987) but she turned down the role as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was too similar to her other films she worked on with Hughes. After Pretty In Pink, Ringwald planned to star in more mature roles. Ringwald was later featured on the cover of Time magazine on May 26, 1986.|$|E
25|$|Silverman {{said the}} joke satirizes the racist thought process. Guy Aoki of the Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) objected to {{her use of}} the slur. NBC and O'Brien apologized, but Silverman did not. Later, {{appearing}} on Politically Incorrect in July and August 2001, Silverman questioned Aoki's sincerity, accusing him of exploiting the opportunity for publicity. On a later episode, Aoki appeared with Silverman and stated he did not accept Silverman's explanation, {{saying that it was}} not successful satire and that comedians should consult groups such as his before performing such material. She stated in an NPR Fresh Air interview that she was asked to repeat the joke on Politically Incorrect, among other places, but eventually dropped it from her act because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was becoming stale.|$|E
25|$|Aguilera {{initially}} {{planned to}} further promote the album by embarking on The Bionic Tour. It {{was announced in}} early May 2010 that twenty shows had been scheduled in North America, which was anticipated to run from July 15, 2010 to August 19, 2010. British singer Leona Lewis {{was said to be}} a supporting act and the tour would be in conjunction with North American leg of Lewis's The Labyrinth tour. Later that month, Aguilera announced that she would postpone the tour until 2011. In a message from tour promoter Live Nation, Aguilera stated that due to the excessive promotion of the album and her then upcoming film debut in Burlesque, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was necessary to take more time to rehearse the show and with less than a month between the album release and the tour, it was impossible to create a show as her fans' expectation.|$|E

25|$|ABC {{was pleased}} with Behr; Nixon was as well, and decided her {{creation}} was safe {{in the hands of}} the new producer. Behr, however, made the unpopular decision to fire Peter Bergman (Cliff Warner) during this time, as well as Ellen Wheeler (Karen) and Robert Gentry (Ross Chandler). Bergman's departure was particularly frustrating to Debbi Morgan (who thought it was a cop-out by ABC on the promising interracial Angie/Cliff pairing; Morgan later defected to the new NBC soap opera Generations in protest), Taylor Miller (who was misled when Behr approached her to bring back her character Nina; Miller was frustrated to find out she had only been brought back for two weeks to facilitate Bergman's departure: Cliff and Nina reunited, married yet again, and left Pine Valley, leaving Miller to lament to Soap Opera Digest that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was going backward for both characters, and difficult emotionally to play), and Bergman himself. Behr then brought back fan favorite Opal Gardner, but instead of contacting Emmy winner Dorothy Lyman to reprise the role, Behr hired Jill Larson. Lyman later noted her disappointment in never being contacted about reprising the role.|$|E
