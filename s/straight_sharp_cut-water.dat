As-received specimens with <b>straight</b> <b>sharp</b> notch were also tested in three-point bending for comparison purposes. It was found that both chevron and straight notched specimen geometries were equally suitable for the fracture toughness determination in terms of average values and data variability according to Weibull and Student’s t statistics. Testing with CN geometry showed that annealing of specimens at a temperature (550 oC) higher than the glass transformation temperature led to a lower value of KIc. The difference in mean fracture toughness values (0. 75 and 0. 64 MPam 1 / 2 before and after annealing, respectively), was ascribed to the different level of compressive residual stresses in the samples...|$|R

It is native to the deserts around the intersection of Arizona, Nevada, and eastern California, where it grows in woodland and scrub habitat on sandy and gravelly substrates.

The narrow leaves are 2 or 3 centimeters long and harden into <b>straight,</b> <b>sharp</b> spines. Clusters of woolly leaves grow near the spines. The inflorescence bears up to 7 flower heads which are each enveloped in four or five woolly phyllaries. Each head contains up to four or five tubular yellow flowers each around a centimeter long.

60|$|Nature {{intended}} {{him to get}} his living, as do {{the other}} woodpeckers, by boring into old trees and stumps for the insects that live on the decaying wood.

But getting his living so means hard work, and he has discovered for himself a much easier way. One now frequently surprises him on the ground in old pastures and orchards, floundering about rather awkwardly (for his little feet were never intended for walking) after the crickets and grasshoppers that abound there. Still he finds the work of catching them much easier than boring into dry old trees, and the insects themselves much larger and more satisfactory.|$|R

2500|$|The {{expansion}} of the park into Jackson Hole brought a requirement for new facilities at the new park gateway at Moose. The Mission 66 program was conceived in 1955 {{to deal with the}} dramatic increase in visitation, particularly automobile-borne tourism, being experienced Park Service-wide. The Moose Visitor Center, a new administration building, and employee residences were built at Moose, just downstream from Menor's Ferry, where a bridge crossed the Snake River. At about the same time the Colter Bay Village complex was developed on Jackson Lake {{in the northern part of}} the park, providing camping, lodging and marina services. The largest development of this era was the new Jackson Lake Lodge, a reinterpretation of the traditional Park Service lodge concept in a modern style by architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood. [...] Underwood, who had designed the rustic Bryce Canyon and Grand Canyon lodges as well as Yosemite's Ahwahnee Hotel, made a sharp break from the naturalistic rustic style, using concrete and steel and <b>straight,</b> <b>sharp</b> lines while he incorporated traditionally rustic colors and textures, framing a view of Mount Moran from the main lobby.

40|$|Abstract Transmission and {{scanning}} electron microscopic examinations were under-taken {{to detail}} {{changes in the}} olfactory epithelium (OE) resulting from the ageing process. Samples were prepared from 3 % glutaraldehyde/ 1 % formaldehyde perfused mice aged 6 months and 29 - 30 months. Compared to OE from young adults, a number of striking changes were apparent in tissue from older animals. The most obvious of these were extensive local accumulations of large inclusion bodies, totally disrupting the normal morphology of such affected areas of olfactory epithelium. Even in areas where these deposits were absent, other significant signs of ageing were noted in the seemingly unaffected OE of all older mice studied. Quantitative analysis of semi-thin resin sections revealed that the OE of aged mice was significantly reduced in thickness, and with significantly fewer olfactory sensory neurons, irrespective {{of whether or not}} inclusions were present. In addition, pale cells, which have been suggested to be a form of degenerating cells, were more abundant in aged OE. The <b>straight,</b> <b>sharp</b> boundary between respiratory and olfactory epithelia which is seen in young adults became irregular and disrupted with age due to an intermingling of the respiratory and olfactory cells. Such structural alterations may parallel olfactory dysfunction reputed to occur in older mammals...|$|R

Species identification Rosa rugosa {{is a small}} sprouting shrub that forms dense thickets. The surface of the leaves is wrinkled, dark green, smooth above while pubescent and slightly sticky underneath. The twigs are stout and covered with thin, <b>straight</b> <b>sharp</b> spines of various sizes. The flowers are big (8 - 10 cm across) and can be white or light to dark pink depending on the cultivar, also doubled flowers occur in the wild. The fruits are large and slightly flattened, shiny, deep red and fleshy "rose-hips " which ripen in late summer. Native range Rosa rugosa occurs naturally in Eastern Asia from Ochotsk and southern Kamchatka to Korea and the northern parts of Japan and China. Alien distribution History of introduction and geographical spread Rosa rugosa is a relatively recent newcomer in the region. The first records of the species being introduced from Japan to Europe are from 1796, but only after 1845 did the species become more abundant (Langeland 1994).

40|$|This paper explores a {{geometrical}} and computationally simple operator, named Ds, {{for local}} isotropy assessment on SAR images. It {{is assumed that}} isotropic intensity distributions in natural areas, either textured or nontextured, correspond to a single cover class. Ds is used to measure isotropy in processing neighborhoods and decide {{if they can be}} considered as belonging to a unique cover class. The speckle statistical properties are used to determine suitable Ds thresholds for discriminating heterogeneous targets from isotropic cover types at different window sizes. An assessment of Ds as an edge detector showed sensitivities {{similar to those of the}} ratio edge operator for <b>straight,</b> <b>sharp</b> boundaries, centered in the processing window, but significantly better sensitivity for detecting heterogeneities during the window expansion in multiresolution filtering. Furthermore, Ds presents the advantage versus the ratio edge coefficient of being rotationally invariant, and its computation indicates the direction of the main intensity gradient in the processing window. The Ds operator is used in a multiresolution fashion for filtering ASAR scenes of the Doñana wetland. The intensities in isotropic areas are averaged in order to flatten fluctuations within cover types and facilitate a subsequent land cover classification. The results show high degree of smoothing within textured cover classes, plus effective spatial adaptation to gradients and irregular boundaries, substantiating the usefulness of this operator for filtering SAR data of natural areas with the purpose of classification...|$|R
