25|$|In June 1944, Kármán {{underwent}} surgery for intestinal cancer in New York City. The surgery caused two hernias, and Kármán's recovery was slow. Early in September, {{while still in}} New York, he met U.S. Army Air Forces Commanding General Henry H. Arnold on a runway at LaGuardia Airport, and Arnold then proposed that Kármán should move to Washington, D.C. to lead the <b>Scientific</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Group</b> and become a long-range planning consultant to the military.

40|$|The next {{challenge}} of space exploration {{is the development}} of the capabilities for long-term missions beyond low earth orbit. NASA s <b>scientific</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> and internal mission studies have identified several fundamental issues which require substantial advancements in new technology if these goals are to be accomplished. Crews must be protected from the severe radiation environment beyond the earth s magnetic field. Chemical propulsion must be replaced by systems that require less mass and are more efficient. The overall launch complement must be reduced by developing repair and fabrication techniques which utilize or recycle available materials...|$|R

The payload for the NASA polar platforms consists of NASA research facility instruments, principal investigator instruments, and foreign-provided research facility instruments.

40|$|COST Action ES 1207, EuBrewNet, was {{proposed}} to coordinate Brewer Spectrophotometer measurements of ozone, spectral UV and aerosol optical depth (AOD-UV) in the UV within Europe, and unite the ozone, UV and AOD communities, through a formally managed European Brewer Network capable of delivering a consistent, spatially homogeneous European data resource, {{significant for the}} World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), the World Ozone and UV Data Centre (WOUDC), the International Ozone Commission (IO 3 C), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) and the ozone trend assessment panels. Around 50 Brewer Spectrophotometers are deployed in Europe, independently funded by national agencies, each were duplicating effort to achieve separately best practice and accuracy. EuBrewNet was established to remove this disparity, establish knowledge exchange and training, and open up a route to links with international agencies and other networks globally. New instrument characterisation, calibration and consistent data processing algorithms have been developed and applied with a new near real time database providing a range of data products resulting from centralised processing algorithms and quality control methods.

30|$|For {{the past}} twenty years, breast cancer advocates {{have been at the}} {{forefront}} of efforts to support and reform translational research processes [9 – 21]. For example, as champions of evidence based practices, Bayesian statistics, adaptive trial design, biospecimen standardization, biomarker validation, improved test result reproducibility, and informed consent reform, advocates have driven change in research practices as well as in FDA initiatives leading to new regulatory and interpretative mechanisms.

40|$|Zoo-based {{research}} in North America is an emerging field, which has progressed from {{an ad hoc}} approach in {{a small number of}} zoos to a coordinated, integrated network of scientists with recognized research programs in approxi-mately one half of the accredited institutions in North America. The disciplines most active in these programs— veterinary medicine and pathology, nutrition, reproductive biology, contraception, and behavior—are now becoming coordinated in zoos through <b>Scientific</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Groups.</b> Zoos with research programs generally establish either an institutional animal care and use committee or another com-mittee to evaluate research proposals. In addition to scien-tific merit and experimental design, zoos evaluate proposals based on factors such as priority by conservation program/ identified need; direct effect on species conservation, spe-cies type, and appropriateness; availability and location of animals; operational requirements/logistics; communication between institutions; and available funding. Euthanasia is considered only in rare circumstances. Zoo-based research has evolved into an integral component in animal manage-ment and conservation programs by providing practical in-formation that is used to improve animal care, well-being, health, and reproduction. However, the degree to which zoos participate in invasive research varies considerably among institutions, due not only to resource limitations but also to how the term “invasive ” is defined and accepted at each institution. A more standardized approach among zoo-logical institutions for examining and approving research projects that are supported by zoo-based conservation pro-grams would greatly facilitate the wildlife research efforts of North American zoos...|$|R
