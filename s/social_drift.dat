40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} whether {{the link between}} epilepsy and deprivation is due to factors associated with deprivation (social causation) or factors associated with a diagnosis of epilepsy (<b>social</b> <b>drift).</b> Methods We reviewed electronic primary health care records from 2004 to 2010, identifying prevalent and incident cases of epilepsy and recording linked deprivation scores. Logistic and Poisson regression models were used to calculate odds ratios and incidence rate ratios. The change in deprivation was measured 10 years after the initial diagnosis of epilepsy for a cohort of people. Results Between 2004 and 2010, 8. 1 million patient-years of records were reviewed. Epilepsy prevalence and incidence {{were significantly associated with}} deprivation. Epilepsy prevalence ranged from 1. 13...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown {{increased}} incidence of non-affective psychotic disorders (NAPD) among ethnic minorities compared to the native population, but not, or less so, in areas with a high own-group proportion. The aim is to investigate this ethnic density effect in Utrecht and whether this effect is due to higher rates of NAPD among Dutch persons in areas with high minority proportions. We also explore the geographical scale at which this effect occurs {{and the influence of}} <b>social</b> <b>drift</b> prior to NAPD. NAPD cases in the Psychiatric Case Registry Middle Netherlands (N = 2, 064) and living in Utrecht during 2000 - 2009 were analyzed in a Poisson model in relation to both individual-level and district- vs. neighborhood-level characteristics. With increasing minority density, especially of the neighborhood, the rate ratios of NAPD significantly decreased among both non-Western (from 2. 36 to 1. 24) and Western immigrants (from 1. 63 to 1. 01), in comparison with Dutch persons. This was partly explained by higher rates of NAPD among Dutch persons in areas with high minority density. But there was also a trend to lower NAPD rates among non-Western minorities in these areas (P = 0. 074). This trend was significant among Surinamese/Antilleans (P = 0. 001) and Moroccans aged 18 - 30 years (P = 0. 046). Among the Dutch, a <b>social</b> <b>drift</b> to minority-dense neighborhoods prior to NAPD registration was found. Our findings support the beneficial association with own-group presence at the smaller scale neighborhood level. Findings show also that this association is more pronounced in immigrant vs. native comparisons and is not found within all ethnic groups...|$|E
40|$|Neighborhood {{influences}} in {{the etiology of}} schizophrenia have been emphasized {{in a number of}} systematic reviews, but causality remains uncertain. To test the <b>social</b> <b>drift</b> hypothesis, we used three complementary genetically informed Swedish cohorts. First, we used nationwide Swedish data on approximately 760 [*] 000 full- and half-sibling pairs born between 1951 and 1974 and quantitative genetic models to study genetic and environmental influences on the overlap between schizophrenia in young adulthood and subsequent residence in socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods. Schizophrenia diagnoses were ascertained using the National Patient Registry. Second, we tested the overlap between childhood psychotic experiences and neighborhood deprivation in early adulthood in the longitudinal Twin Study of Child and Adolescent Development (TCHAD; n= 2960). Third, we investigated to what extent polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia predicted residence in deprived neighborhoods during late adulthood using the TwinGene sample (n= 6796). Sibling data suggested that living in deprived neighborhoods was substantially heritable; 65 % (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) : 60 - 71 %) of the variance was attributed to genetic influences. Although the correlation between schizophrenia and neighborhood deprivation was moderate in magnitude (r= 0. 22; 95 % CI: 0. 20 - 0. 24), it was entirely explained by genetic influences. We replicated these findings in the TCHAD sample. Moreover, the association between polygenic risk for schizophrenia and neighborhood deprivation was statistically significant (R(2) = 0. 15 %, P= 0. 002). Our findings are primarily consistent with a genetic selection interpretation where genetic liability for schizophrenia also predicts subsequent residence in socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods. Previous studies may have overemphasized the relative importance of environmental {{influences in}} the <b>social</b> <b>drift</b> of schizophrenia patients. Clinical and policy interventions will therefore benefit from the future identification of potentially causal pathways between different dimensions of cognitive functions and socioeconomic trajectories derived from studies adopting family-based research designs...|$|E

40|$|There is convincing {{evidence}} that lower socioeconomic position is associated with increased risk of mental disorders. However, the mechanisms involved are not well understood. This study aims to elucidate the causal pathways between socioeconomic position and depression symptoms in South African adults. Two possible causal theories are examined: social causation, which suggests that poor socioeconomic conditions cause mental ill health; and <b>social</b> <b>drift,</b> which suggests that those with poor mental health {{are more likely to}} drift into poor socioeconomic circumstances. The study used longitudinal and cross-sectional observational data on 3904 adults, from a randomised trial carried out in 38 primary health care clinics between 2011 and 2012. Structural equation models and counterfactual mediation analyses were used to examine causal pathways in two directions. First, we examined social causation pathways, with language (a proxy for racial or ethnic category) being treated as an exposure, while education, unemployment, income and depression were treated as sequential mediators and outcomes. Second, <b>social</b> <b>drift</b> was explored with depression treated as a potential influence on health-related quality of life, job loss and, finally, income. The results suggest that the effects of language on depression at baseline, and on changes in depression during follow-up, were mediated through education and income but not through unemployment. Adverse effects of unemployment and job loss on depression appeared to be mostly mediated through income. The effect of depression on decreasing income appeared to be mediated by job loss. These results suggest that both social causation and social selection processes operate concurrently. This raises the possibility that people could get trapped in a vicious cycle in which poor socioeconomic conditions lead to depression, which, in turn, can cause further damage to their economic prospects. This study also suggests that modifiable factors such as income, employment and treatable depression are suitable targets for intervention in the short to medium term, while in the longer term reducing inequalities in education will be necessary to address the deeply entrenched inequalities in South Africa...|$|E
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} suicide and "undetermined" deaths by age, economic activity status, and social class in Great Britain among males of working age. DESIGN [...] The study was a cross sectional analysis of Registrar General's data for England and Wales around 1981, repeated for around 1971, and for Scotland around 1971 and 1981. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] For England and Wales around 1971, suicide and undetermined death rates showed a progressive increase with age and a markedly higher rate in the lower social classes. A significant interaction effect was identified in the central age groups of the lower occupational categories. This interaction was confirmed in the remaining three data sets, notwithstanding some differences in the profile of age specific mortality. Other findings included a higher standardised mortality ratio for the economically inactive, who also showed an earlier peak in age specific mortality, and a relative concentration of undetermined as compared to suicide deaths in the lower social classes, but not all these further results were fully replicated. CONCLUSIONS [...] There is a concentration of suicide and undetermined deaths in the middle age groups of the lower social classes.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} the impact of pay on job satisfaction. Moreover, it studies {{the changes in the}} structure of the work force, as well as in the way work is done, on the pay to job satisfaction relationship. Design/methodology/approach – A confirmatory survey is conducted, and results are presented. Findings – The study suggests that gender is a variable affecting the relationship of pay to employees’ job satisfaction. It highlights the roles of education and training in user participation and system usage. The study investigates the current situation in Lebanese commercial banks. Research limitations/implications – The outcome of the study could have significant implications on managerial decision-making in the process of implementing novel technologies in banks. It also points to policy changes needed at the human resource management levels. Practical implications – The study findings suggest a needed change at the policy-making levels of corporate human resource management, as more and more employees are becoming extensive information system users on the job. Social implications – If the suggested practical implications are applied, the social implications derived therefrom will generate a <b>social</b> <b>drift</b> in attitude toward gender differentials. Originality/value – The paper is based on a large sample collection from the services sector, commercial banking in Lebanon. The quantitative survey results highlight a number of correlations and tests a suggested model. It puts forth a linear relationship between the different variables under consideration and suggests recommendations for practitioners. PublishedN/...|$|E

40|$|Background: Health {{selection}} {{has been}} proposed to explain the patterning of alcohol-related mortality by area deprivation. This study investigated whether persons who die from alcohol-related conditions {{are more likely to}} experience <b>social</b> <b>drift</b> than those who die from other causes. Methods: Deaths recorded in Scotland (2013, > 21 years) were coded as ‘alcohol-related’ or ‘other’ and by deprivation decile of residence at death. Acute hospital admissions data from 1996 to 2012 were used to provide premortality deprivation data. χ² tests estimated the difference between observed and expected alcohol-related deaths by first Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) decile and type of death. Logistic regression models were fitted using type of death as the outcome of interest and change in SIMD decile as the exposure of interest. Results: Of 47 [*] 012 deaths, 1458 were alcohol-related. Upward and downward mobility was observed for both types of death. An estimated 31 more deaths than expected were classified ‘alcohol-related’ among cases whose deprivation score decreased, while 204 more deaths than expected were classified ‘alcohol-related’ among cases whose initial deprivation ranking was in the four most deprived deciles. Becoming more deprived and first deprivation category were both associated with increased odds of type of death being alcohol-related after adjusting for confounders. Conclusion: This study suggests that health selection appears to contribute less to the deprivation gradient in alcohol-related mortality in Scotland than an individual’s initial area deprivation category...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc (Dietetics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Background: The {{global burden}} of {{cardiovascular}} diseases (CVDs) is escalating {{as part of}} the rapid health transition that developing countries are experiencing. This increase is associated with shifts in demographics and economics, two of the major factors that affect diet and activity. The term <b>social</b> <b>drift</b> phenomenon (SDP) is used to describe the observations that: {{in the early stages of}} the epidemiological and nutrition transitions, it is usually the more affluent, higher socio–economic groups that are affected; in the later stages, it is the poor, lower socio–economic groups that display the consequences of these transitions. Therefore, in developing countries at the beginning of the transition, affluent people have higher prevalence of obesity and increased CVD risk. In developed countries, at much later stages of the transition, obesity and increased CVD risk is more prevalent in the lower socio–economic groups. In South Africa, the Transition and Health during Urbanisation of South Africans (THUSA) study which was done in 1996 / 1998 indicated that at that time, most of the risk factors for CVD were observed in the more urbanised (richer) subjects. It is not known if this pattern changed in any way due to the present rapid urbanisation of South African blacks. Therefore, in this study we explored the associations between socio–economic status (SES) (measured by level of urbanisation, education and employment) and CVD risk factors in an African population undergoing transition in the North–West Province of South Africa, that were prevalent in 2005 when the baseline data for in the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study were collected. Objectives: The main objective of this dissertation was to examine the SDP in an African population in a nutrition and health transition, by: (i) Reviewing the literature on associations between socio–economic variables and biological health outcomes focusing on CVD risk factors in developed and developing countries; (ii) Analysing the baseline data from the 2005 PURE study to examine the relationships between components of SES, namely level of iii urbanisation, education and occupation, and nutrition–related CVD risk factors in men and women participating in the PURE study; and (iii) Comparing results on these associations between CVD risk factors and SES from the PURE study with those found in the THUSA study, which was conducted almost 10 years earlier, to examine if <b>social</b> <b>drift</b> in these associations has taken place. Study design: The dissertation is based on a comparison of the CVD risk factors and socio–economic status of the THUSA and PURE studies. Secondary analysis of the baseline cross–sectional epidemiological data from the PURE study was executed. The South African PURE study is part of a 12 –year Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology study which investigates the health transition in urban and rural subjects in 22 different countries. The main selection criterion was that there should be migration stability within the chosen rural and urban communities. The rural community (A) was identified 450 km west of Potchefstroom on the highway to Botswana. A deep rural community (B), 35 km east from A and only accessible by gravel road, was also included. Both communities are still under tribal law. The urban communities (C and D) were chosen near the University in Potchefstroom. Community C was selected from Ikageng, the established part of the township next to Potchefstroom, and D from the informal settlements surrounding community C. The baseline data for PURE were collected from October to December 2005. A total of 2010 apparently healthy African volunteers (35 years and older), with no reported chronic diseases of lifestyle, tuberculosis (TB) or known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were recruited from a sample of 6000 randomly selected households. Methods: A variety of quantitative and qualitative research techniques was used by multidisciplinary teams to collect, measure and interpret data generated from biological samples and validated questionnaires. For this study, the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) package (version 17. 0, SPSS Inc) was used to analyze the data. Means and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of CVD risk and dietary factors were calculated. Participants of both genders were divided into different groups (according to urbanisation, education and employment levels) and compared. Estimated significant differences between rural and urban participants were determined with analysis of variance using the general linear model (GLM), multivariate procedure. Univariate analysis was used to explore further the influence of education on CVD risk factors and dietary intakes. Employment was used as a proxy for income, and pairwise comparisons using GLM, multivariate procedure were done for comparing the three groups (Not answered, employed and not employed). Tests were considered significant at P< 0. 05. Results: Comparison of urban with rural subjects participating in the PURE study showed that urban men had significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures and lower fibrinogen levels than rural men. In women, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and serum triglycerides were significantly higher in urban subjects whereas fibrinogen levels were significantly lower among urban subjects. After examining the relationship between the level of education and CVD risk factors, we observed that men with higher education levels had significantly higher BMI. In women, serum triglycerides and blood pressure were lower and BMI was significantly higher in the educated subjects. Because it was difficult to distinguish between reported household and individual income levels, we compared CVD risk factors of employed and unemployed subjects. Employed men had significantly higher BMI whereas the unemployed men had significantly higher fasting glucose and fibrinogen levels. Although mean blood pressure of employed men was higher than that of unemployed men, the difference did not reach significance. In women, the only significant difference seen was that employed women had lower high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, fasting glucose, triglycerides and fibrinogen levels, but they had a significantly higher BMI. Employed women had significantly higher BMI than unemployed women (27. 9 [26. 3 – 29. 4] versus 26. 5 [26. 0 – 27. 0] kg/m 2). It seems that most of the nutrition related CVD risk factors were still higher in the higher socio–economic group, a situation similar to that reported in the THUSA study. v Conclusion: The results of this study showed little evidence of a major <b>social</b> <b>drift</b> in CVD risk factors from subjects participating in the 1996 / 1998 THUSA study to those in the 2005 PURE study. Most cardiovascular disease risk factors are still higher in the higher SES groups. However, there were some indications (increased fibrinogen in both men and women living in rural areas; higher triglyceride and fasting glucose levels in unemployed women; no significant differences in blood pressure and total cholesterol across different SES groups which existed in the THUSA study) that a <b>social</b> <b>drift</b> in CVD risk factors in our African population is on the way. This means that promotion of healthy, prudent diets and lifestyles should be targeted to Africans from all socio–economic levels for the prevention of CVD. Master...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to increace the knolewdge {{regarding}} failure within social entrepreneuship. We want to investigate the perception of failure of social entrepreneurs. To discover the experiences of the participants we have used the interpretative phenomenological analysis. We have conducted and analyzed three in-debth interviews. The data was collected from entrepreneurs/CEOs, who had experienced a failure within the social enterprise. Two of the failures were  financial  and one participant experienced a <b>social</b> mission <b>drift.</b> The participants were running i organizations that had the status of social enterprise. Based on literature search, we defined five elements of social entrepreneurship: individual, organization, environment, mission and learning. We aim to understand how the participants consider these elements in relation with failure, either <b>social</b> mission <b>drift</b> or financial failure.     The findings suggest that the elements of social enterpreneurship are in reciprocal relation to the failure. Accordingly, for example, the individual has an effect to the failure and failure has an effect to the individual.  This has been analyzed with a framework created and we have discover how the elements contribute on failure and how the failure will affect the elements.  The only element where the reciprocity was not visible was learning but we do not consider this to prove it since the study is not longitudinal.   There are several theoretical implications of the study. This study increases knowledge on the social entrepreneurs' perception of failure. The theory about social entrepreneurial failure is developed further in socioeconomic and geographic context of Finland, where the status of social enterprise is defined in legislation.   Since social entrepreneurship has different characteristics in different schools of thought divided geographically, the implication possibilities within the European school of thought is evident.   Practical implications of the study can be identified as development of knowledge of social entrepreneurship in Finland. We have identified several problems relating to the govenrnmant's mission to employ disabled and long-term unemployed. It is considered by the all the participants that the legislation does not serve the phenomenon and should accordingly be developed. The study contributes by displaying the experiences of the social entrepreneurs. In developing social entrepreneurship this is crucial, since improvement is difficult to achieve without understanding the faults. The study will pinpoint the problematic issues. By developing social entrepreneurship the study contributes improving the quality of life of disabled and long-term unemployed who the Finnish government tries to help through social enterprises. In addition to the development within governmental level, the study contributes to the individuals, who are planning to establish a social enterprise. The study helps them to consider the issues, which have been experienced by other social entrepreneurs...|$|R

The evidence in this paper does not indicate that a "welfare retrenchment" has occurred, nor that <b>social</b> transfers have <b>drifted</b> in their target from the poor to the middle class.

40|$|Background: Although a {{short-term}} effect of neighborhood characteristics on individual alcohol abuse {{has been demonstrated}} by a quasi-experimental residential mobility study, the observed effect of alcohol problem involvement on place of residence and residential character has not been studied. We test the alcoholism effect on place of residence, and we also attempt to replicate the neighborhood-to-alcoholism effect. Methods: A sample of 206 Caucasian men (average age was 33) who were systematically recruited for alcoholism through a court record search of drunk driving offenses and doorto-door canvassing, in a 4 -county-wide area were followed up at 3 -year intervals in a prospective study of the course and outcomes of alcoholism. Participants’ alcoholism diagnoses were made by semistructured diagnostic interviews. Residential addresses at baseline and at 12 -year follow-up were geocoded. Corresponding census tract variables were used as indicators of neighborhood residential character. Results: The regression analysis shows that, the more alcohol problems a man has, the more likely {{he is going to}} remain in, or migrate into, a disadvantaged neighborhood. This effect is only evident when a number of relevant confounding variables, including initial level of socioeconomic status, age, antisocial symptomatology, and spousal alcohol-use disorder status at baseline are controlled. Alcoholics in remission tended to live in neighborhoods whose residential characteristics were not distinguishable from those of nonalcoholics. Unremitted alcoholics, however, tended to stay in or migrate into more disadvantaged neighborhoods. Conclusion: Alcoholic involvement has long-term negative effects on place of residence; involving an elevated likelihood of moving into or remaining in a disadvantaged neighborhood. Recovery from alcoholism is protective against downward <b>social</b> <b>drift</b> on the one hand, and is favorable to improvement in social conditions on the other...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine if healthcare access disparities exist across race and gender in a publically funded safety-net healthcare system in Texas. Data were examined from a representative random sample of 1468 adults aged 18 - 64 who were patients in this safety-net system in July and August of 2000 and were analyzed using binary logistic regression and chi-square measures of significance. Major Findings: On measures of health status - overall health rating (p =. 051), limited employment (p =. 000), energy level (p =. 001), and worry (p =. 012) - Anglos reported the worst health; Mexican Americans, the best health; with African Americans intermediate. Mexican Americans {{were more likely to have}} never had health insurance, and to also have had insurance in the past year; Anglos were least likely to have ever had insurance (p =. 015) or to have had insurance in the past year (p =. 000). On use of EDs (p =. 028), problems getting prescription medicines (p =. 029), and foregoing other necessities of life to pay for healthcare, Mexican Americans were least disadvantaged with African Americans reporting greatest use of EDs among both men and women, and Anglos the most problems with prescription medicines and foregoing care, especially among women. Logistic regression revealed that health status was the strongest predictor of problems accessing healthcare in all groups; the poorer health status of safety-net patients, the more problems they had accessing care. Patterns of poor reported health status and greater problems accessing care among Anglos relative to other groups is discussed in terms of <b>social</b> <b>drift</b> and relative deprivation...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Two earlier {{population-based}} studies provide {{conflicting information}} on the association between low socioeconomic status (SES) and risk for epilepsy. Seizure etiologies (e. g., head injury, stroke) associated with low SES were not addressed in prior analyses. We assess the relation between SES indices and incident epilepsy separately {{for children and adults}} and in subgroups defined by seizure etiology. METHODS: In this population-based case-control study, a surveillance system identified incident unprovoked seizure or first diagnosis of epilepsy throughout Iceland (n = 418). Controls were selected from the population registry as the next two same-sex births alive, residing in Iceland {{at the time of the}} index seizure, and without a history of unprovoked seizure on the date of the case's incident seizure (n = 835). The odds ratio measured the association between SES and epilepsy. RESULTS: An association was found between epilepsy and SES among adults, but not among children. Among adults, low education was associated with an increased risk for epilepsy [odds ratio (OR), 2. 29; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 21 - 4. 34), and home ownership was protective (OR, 0. 63; 95 % CI, 0. 43 - 0. 92). When analyses were repeated by seizure etiology, this association remained only in the group with epilepsy of unknown cause, even after adjusting for alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Low SES, indexed by low education or lack of home ownership, is a risk factor for epilepsy in adults, but not in children, suggesting a cumulative effect of SES on risk for epilepsy. This association is not explained by established risk factors for epilepsy (e. g., head injury, stroke). We find no evidence of a downward <b>social</b> <b>drift</b> among cases whose parents had epilepsy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In 2004, {{tuberculosis}} (TB) {{was responsible}} for 2. 5 % of global mortality (among men 3. 1 %; among women 1. 8 %) and 2. 2 % of global burden of disease (men 2. 7 %; women 1. 7 %). The present work portrays accumulated evidence on the association between alcohol consumption and TB with the aim to clarify {{the nature of the}} relationship. Methods A systematic review of existing scientific data on the association between alcohol consumption and TB, and on studies relevant for clarification of causality was undertaken. Results There is a strong association between heavy alcohol use/alcohol use disorders (AUD) and TB. A meta-analysis on the risk of TB for these factors yielded a pooled relative risk of 2. 94 (95 % CI: 1. 89 - 4. 59). Numerous studies show pathogenic impact of alcohol on the immune system causing susceptibility to TB among heavy drinkers. In addition, there are potential social pathways linking AUD and TB. Heavy alcohol use strongly influences both the incidence and the outcome of the disease and was found to be linked to altered pharmacokinetics of medicines used in treatment of TB, <b>social</b> marginalization and <b>drift,</b> higher rate of re-infection, higher rate of treatment defaults and development of drug-resistant forms of TB. Based on the available data, about 10 % of the TB cases globally were estimated to be attributable to alcohol. Conclusion The epidemiological and other evidence presented indicates that heavy alcohol use/AUD constitute a risk factor for incidence and re-infection of TB. Consequences for prevention and clinical interventions are discussed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Ecological {{studies on}} the {{distribution}} of rates of first-admitted schizophrenics were carried out in Mannheim in 1965 and from 1974 to 1980. As the catchment area of the ABC Schizophrenia Study comprises the cities of Mannheim and Heidelberg, we were able to conduct a third ecological study for Mannheim and a first study for Heidelberg covering the years 1987 to 1989. High rates of schizophrenic residents are found in the inner districts of Mannheim and Heidelberg. This concentration has been stable over a period of 25 years for Mannheim. Subdividing the districts of Mannheim and Heidelberg into zones, only in Heidelberg and only for the second cross-section in Mannheim, the rates decreased constantly with increasing distance from the centre. Summing up the districts of Mannheim and Heidelberg in homogenous areas on the basis of economical and socio-demographic properties, high rates of schizophrenics were found in homogenous areas with poor and unfavourable living conditions. In Mannheim and Heidelberg, homogenous areas with the highest rates of schizophrenics are characterised by highly unfavourable living conditions, a high percentage of young men, people living alone, students, foreigners, people with a low level of education and a high immigration/emigration rate. The analysis on the individual level, i. e. in the biography of schizophrenics shows that processes of <b>social</b> <b>drift</b> and/or nonstarter take place long before first admission in the prodromal phase and the psychotic prephase of beginning schizophrenia. Probably, these selective processes like downward drift or nonstarting processes, lead to the migration of schizophrenics into unfavourable areas or schizophrenic residents staying in poor areas, while healthy residents leave these districts. Selective processes such as help seeking behaviour and access to the care system have no effect on the unequal distribution. In summary, a definite confirmation or refutation of one of the two causal hypotheses, 'social selection' vs. 'social causation', is not possible up to date, but the empirical results support the selective hypothesis for schizophrenic disorders.

40|$|Individuals {{who live}} in socioeconomically {{deprived}} neighborhoods, particularly in urban settings, experience elevated risk of being convicted of violent criminality, to engage in substance misuse and to be diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. The causal nature of these associations is questioned in the literature because previous studies have insufficiently accounted for genetic and environmental risks shared within families. The aim of the dissertation was therefore to explore the etiological relevance of neighborhoods in these traits by combining quasi-experimental, family-based research designs with nationwide Swedish registry data. In Studies I and II, we investigated the associations between residence in deprived neighborhoods and family income during childhood on subsequent risks of being convicted of violent offences and to engage in substance misuse. We found that biological full-siblings who had been differentially exposed to deprived neighborhoods, due to residential relocations between their birthdays, or to family income, due to the parents’ career trajectories, {{did not differ from}} one another in terms of their risks for being convicted or to engage in substance misuse. In Study III, we studied the associations between neighborhood deprivation and population density on later risks of being diagnosed with schizophrenia. Biological full-siblings who had been differentially exposed to the different neighborhood conditions did not differ from one another in terms of their risks of schizophrenia. In Study IV, we used quantitative genetic models that compared biological full and half-siblings to understand the etiology of <b>social</b> <b>drift</b> in schizophrenia. We found that the heritability of living in deprived neighborhoods was 60 percent. Schizophrenia patients were more likely to live in deprived neighborhoods but this was due to common genetic influences. In conclusion, we found that familial risks simultaneously explained parental selection into high-risk neighborhoods as well as their offspring’s increased risks of adverse outcomes. Methodologically, these studies emphasize the importance of accounting for unobserved familial confounders in epidemiological studies of socioeconomic status and later behavioral and psychiatric outcomes. Substantively, the findings indicate that efficient prevention efforts to decrease the rates of the examined outcomes must consider a broader range of familial and individual risks than merely socioeconomic and demographic measures, at least in the Swedish context...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundIn 2004, {{tuberculosis}} (TB) {{was responsible}} for 2. 5 % of global mortality (among men 3. 1 %; among women 1. 8 %) and 2. 2 % of global burden of disease (men 2. 7 %; women 1. 7 %). The present work portrays accumulated evidence on the association between alcohol consumption and TB with the aim to clarify {{the nature of the}} relationship. MethodsA systematic review of existing scientific data on the association between alcohol consumption and TB, and on studies relevant for clarification of causality was undertaken.

6000|$|If Emerson stood thus well {{towards the}} <b>social</b> and {{political}} <b>drift</b> of events, his teaching {{was no less}} harmoniously related to the new and most memorable drift of science which set in by his side. It is a misconception to pretend {{that he was a}} precursor of the Darwinian theory. Evolution, as a possible explanation of the ordering of the universe, is a great deal older than either Emerson or Darwin. What Darwin did was to work out in detail and with masses of minute evidence a definite hypothesis of the specific conditions under which new forms are evolved. Emerson, of course, had no definite hypothesis of this sort, nor did he possess any of the knowledge necessary to give it value. But it was his good fortune that some of his strongest propositions harmonise with the scientific theory of the survival of the fittest in the struggle for material existence. He connects his exhortation to self-reliance with the law working in nature for conservation and growth,--to wit, that 'Power is in nature the essential measure of right,' and that 'Nature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdom which cannot help itself.' The same strain is constantly audible. Nature on every side, within us and without, is for ever throwing out new forms and fresh varieties of living and thinking. To her experiments in every region there is no end. Those succeed which prove to have the best adaptation to the conditions. Let, therefore, neither society nor the individual check experiment, originality, and infinite variation. Such language, we may see, fits in equally well with democracy in politics and with evolution in science. If, moreover, modern science gives more prominence to one conception than another, it is to that of the natural universe of force and energy, as One and a Whole. This too is the great central idea with Emerson, repeated a thousand times in prose and in verse, and lying {{at the very heart of}} his philosophy. Newton's saying that 'the world was made at one cast' delights him. 'The secret of the world is that its energies are solidaires.' Nature 'publishes itself in creatures, reaching from particles and spicula, through transformation on transformation to the highest symmetries. A little heat, that is, a little motion, is all that differences the bald dazzling white and deadly cold poles of the earth from the prolific tropical climates.' Not only, as Professor Tyndall says, is Emerson's religious sense entirely undaunted by the discoveries of science; all such discoveries he comprehends and assimilates. 'By Emerson scientific conceptions are continually transmuted into the finer forms and warmer lines of an ideal world.' ...|$|R
40|$|After World War II at {{the height}} of decolonization, the {{analysis}} of the underlying process of economic growth became a topic of high priority. The neo-classical, Solowian, growth theory, with all its limitations, was embraced by economists and historians alike, resulting in countless growth accounting studies and further research into country-specific institutional developments. Later, however, especially with the introduction of new growth theories, economics and other <b>social</b> sciences have <b>drifted</b> somewhat apart. Economics preserved its focus on both the theory and empirics of economic growth, while the focus on country-specific institutional development remained largely absent. This practice, however, set a limit to the possibilities to apply new growth theories to the real-world economic development. Also, given its strong relationship with the Solowian growth theory, {{it is not surprising that}} even within economics one may encounter the view that the new growth theories have nothing new to offer after all. Before drawing such a premature conclusion, however, it is advisable to establish a link among new growth theories and History in order to find out whether the latter offers new insights into the root of differences in economic performance. This thesis focuses on three Asian countries, a successful (Japan) and two less successful economic developers (India and Indonesia). Our main question is whether the new growth theories can explain why Japan was successful in economic development relative to India and Indonesia. Besides the theoretics and empirics of economic growth, matters which are extensively treated in the economic literature, it is important to focus on what human capital, the main engine in the new growth theories, actually is, and what effect country-specific institutions have. Our main conclusions are that the some of the more commonly used human capital proxies only capture human capital to a certain extent. As they either underestimate the growth of human capital or proxy the growth, instead of the level, of human capital, they (falsely) bias the choice of the new growth theories towards the Romer (1990) model. But even when using the applicable stock if human capital and the applicable growth theory, still there are considerable differences in economic growth among countries. Circa 50 % of these differences in income levels among India, Indonesia, and Japan resulted from differences in country-specific human capital forming institutions. These differences can be traced back to the construction of their education systems. In Japan, as in most Western countries, the education system arose in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century from the need for economic development and was responsive to the special characteristics of the respective societies. In India and Indonesia, on the other hand, similarly to most developing economies, it were largely ideas of 'creating an indigenous class of literati', a 'moral duty of the colonizer country', nationalism, and, after World War II, the 'idea of progress by education', 'lack of finances', and 'policies of international organisations' that drove educational development. In other words, the education systems of India and Indonesia were influenced by global, or at least external, factors...|$|R
