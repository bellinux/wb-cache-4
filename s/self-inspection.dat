5|$|The Gore letter did spur some {{progress}} in negotiations, as the Soviet Union allowed in late November 1958 for explicit control measures {{to be included}} in the text of the drafted treaty. By March 1959, the negotiators had agreed upon seven treaty articles, but they primarily concerned uncontroversial issues and a number of disputes over verification persisted. First, the Soviet verification proposal was deemed by the West to be too reliant on <b>self-inspection,</b> with control posts primarily staffed by citizens of the country housing the posts and a minimal role for officials from the international supervisory body. The West insisted that half of a control post staff be drawn from another nuclear state and half from neutral parties. Second, the Soviet Union required that the international supervisory body, the Control Commission, require unanimity before acting; the West rejected the idea of giving Moscow a veto over the Commission's proceedings. Finally, the Soviet Union preferred temporary inspection teams drawn from citizens of the country under inspection, while the West insisted on permanent teams composed of inspectors from the Control Commission.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY – {{patients}} with diabetes mellitus often suffer from diabetic foot syndrome, a con-dition leading to foot ulceration or even amputation of lower extremity. peripheral neuropathy com-bined with repetitive {{trauma to the}} foot and peripheral vascular disease are the main etiological factors {{in the development of}} foot ulcers. Other major contributive factors include the effects of callus, increased plantar pressures, and local infections. patient education concerning their disease has {{a central role in the}} prevention of foot ulcers. Ordinary preventive measures taken by the pati-ent include regular <b>self-inspections,</b> appropriate daily hygiene of the feet, appropriate footwear to reduce plantar pressures, and medical pedicure performed by a pedicurist experienced in diabetic foot patients. The importance of callus in diabetic patients has been shown in several studies by high predictability of subsequent ulcer development in {{patients with}} plantar calluses. For removing callus, urea based preparations are considered to be the treatment of choice. In case of local bacterial and fungal diabetic foot infections, systemic antibiotic and systemic antimycotic therapy is indicated, respectively. wound dressings of various types are the mainstay in the treatment of chronic foot ulcers with avoidance of occlusive dressings in infected ulcers. Since the vast majority of ulcers and amputations can be prevented in diabetic patients, proper diagnosis and multidisciplinary approach are essential...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) Caribbean Division was alleged recently to have taken inappropriate credit for arrests to gain more resources. To claim credit for drug-related arrests, DEA agents must be directly involved in domestic arrests and provide "substantial assistance" to host-country law enforcement officials in foreign arrests. DEA's Agents Manual defines substantial assistance as active participation or furnishing of information or funds that lead to an arrest. Agents must complete a "Personal History Report" on each person arrested and complete a "Report of Investigation" on the investigative activities leading to the arrest. DEA uses the Personal History Report to track the number of arrests.

60|$|A narrow grave-yard in {{the heart}} of a bustling, {{indifferent}} city, seen from the windows of a gloomy-looking inn, is at no time an object of enlivening suggestion; and the spectacle is not at its best when the mouldy tombstones and funereal umbrage have received the ineffectual refreshment of a dull, moist snow-fall. If, while the air is thickened by this frosty drizzle, the calendar should happen to indicate that the blessed vernal season is already six weeks old, it will be admitted that no depressing influence is absent from the scene. This fact was keenly felt on a certain 12th of May, upwards of thirty years since, by a lady who stood looking {{out of one of the}} windows of the best hotel in the ancient city of Boston. She had stood there for half an hour--stood there, that is, at intervals; for from time to time she turned back into the room and measured its length with a restless step. In the chimney-place was a red-hot fire which emitted a small blue flame; and in front of the fire, at a table, sat a young man who was busily plying a pencil. He had a number of sheets of paper cut into small equal squares, and he was apparently covering them with pictorial designs--strange-looking figures. He worked rapidly and attentively, sometimes threw back his head and held out his drawing at arm's-length, and kept up a soft, gay-sounding humming and whistling. The lady brushed past him in her walk; her much-trimmed skirts were voluminous. She never dropped her eyes upon his work; she only turned them, occasionally, as she passed, to a mirror suspended above the toilet-table on the other side of the room. Here she paused a moment, gave a pinch to her waist with her two hands, or raised these members--they were very plump and pretty--to the multifold braids of her hair, with a movement half caressing, half corrective. An attentive observer might have fancied that during these periods of desultory <b>self-inspection</b> her face forgot its melancholy; but as soon as she neared the window again it began to proclaim that she was a very ill-pleased woman. And indeed, in what met her eyes there was little to be pleased with. The window-panes were battered by the sleet; the head-stones in the grave-yard beneath seemed to be holding themselves askance to keep it out of their faces. A tall iron railing protected them from the street, and on the other side of the railing an assemblage of Bostonians were trampling about in the liquid snow. Many of them were looking up and down; they appeared to be waiting for something. From time to time a strange vehicle drew near to the place where they stood,--such a vehicle as the lady at the window, in spite of a considerable acquaintance with human inventions, had never seen before: a huge, low omnibus, painted in brilliant colors, and decorated apparently with jangling bells, attached to a species of groove in the pavement, through which it was dragged, with a great deal of rumbling, bouncing and scratching, by a couple of remarkably small horses. When it reached a certain point the people in front of the grave-yard, of whom much the greater number were women, carrying satchels and parcels, projected themselves upon it in a compact body--a movement suggesting the scramble for places in a life-boat at sea--and were engulfed in its large interior. Then the life-boat--or the life-car, as the lady at the window of the hotel vaguely designated it--went bumping and jingling away upon its invisible wheels, with the helmsman (the man at the wheel) guiding its course incongruously from the prow. This phenomenon was repeated every three minutes, and the supply of eagerly-moving women in cloaks, bearing reticules and bundles, renewed itself in the most liberal manner. On the other side of the grave-yard was a row of small red brick houses, showing a series of homely, domestic-looking backs; at the end opposite the hotel a tall wooden church-spire, painted white, rose high into the vagueness of the snow-flakes. The lady at the window looked at it for some time; for reasons of her own she thought it the ugliest thing she had ever seen. She hated it, she despised it; it threw her into a state of irritation that was quite out of proportion to any sensible motive. She had never known herself to care so much about church-spires.|$|E

5000|$|On November 5, 1974, Kerr-McGee {{worker and}} labor union activist Karen Silkwood found herself exposed to {{plutonium}}-239 after working to grind and polish plutonium pellets {{by way of}} a glovebox to be used in nuclear fuel rods at the Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site in Oklahoma. Inspection of the gloves would yield no evidence of external leakage of radioactive contaminant from the glovebox, despite the fact that plutonium had been found on those surfaces of the gloves that had contact with Silkwood's hands, and no other source for a plutonium leak could be ascertained despite thorough inspections of the air vents and surrounding surfaces. However, on November 6, despite Silkwood's prior decontamination and <b>self-inspection,</b> a detection on her part the next day yielded more signs of alpha activity on her hands, while health physics staff at the plant subsequently detected further alpha activity on her right forearm, neck and face. On November 7, Silkwood tested positive for very significant levels of alpha activity, and an inspection of her apartment showed high levels of radioactive contamination. Thereafter, Silkwood and two other co-workers personally associated with her (roommate Sherri Ellis and boyfriend Drew Stephens) would be tested at Los Alamos National Laboratory; while the latter two only tested positive for insignificant amounts of plutonium exposure, Silkwood was found to have [...] of plutonium-239 in her lungs, though researcher Dr. George Voelz insisted that this amount was still negligible and non-harmful. Later posthumous measurements taken after Silkwood's death under separate but likewise controversial circumstances were shown to be roughly consistent with the initial findings described by Dr. Voelz, but also indicated that she had somehow ingested plutonium prior to her demise. It would also be found that Karen Silkwood would not have had access to plutonium-239 for months after her transfer from metallography to rod assembly.|$|E
5000|$|Kierkegaard says, {{every person}} has {{to find out for}} him or her self how guilt and sin came into their worlds. Kierkegaard argued about this in both Repetition and Fear and Trembling where he said {{philosophy}} must not define faith. He asks his reader, the single individual, to consider some questions. Can sin and guilt be transferred from one person to another? Is it [...] "an epidemic that spreads like cowpox"? Was every Jewish person responsible for the crucifixion of Christ? Does the single individual find sin in others or in him or herself? He believed in a rigorous <b>self-inspection</b> {{and at the same time}} a lenient inspection of others. He put it this way in Four Upbuilding Discourses of 1844: [...] We do not know the life of Paul in great detail, but we do, however, know Paul, which is the main consideration. That is to say, just as the sensate man is distinguishable by his seeing the speck in his brother’s eye but not seeing the log in his own, by his rigorously condemning the same fault in others that he lightly forgives in himself, so the mark of a more profound and concerned person is that he judges himself more rigorously, uses all his ingenuity to excuse the other person but is unable to excuse or forgive himself, indeed, is convinced that the other one is more excusable, because there is always still a possibility, since the only one in relation to whom a person is deprived of this possibility is he himself. Bold confidence is a difficult matter, because it is not exactly synonymous with mental weakness. One may very well stop with it and need not go further by even wishing to judge God, that is, if in other respects bold confidence is bold confidence in the judgment, which certainly requires that God’s judgment penetrate the thought and heart, that is, if it is bold confidence in God’s mercy and there words are not a feigned pious expression of one’s own thoughtlessness, which does not trust God but is consoled by having ceased to sorrow long ago. If no human being is capable of acquitting himself he is capable of one thing-of indicting himself so terribly that he cannot acquit himself but learns to need mercy. With regard to this, it is difficult for one person to understand another, because the earnest person always lays the stress on himself.

Mice are able recognize MHC-similar individuals through speci¢c odour cues. However, to mate disassortatively for MHC genes, individuals must have a referent, either themselves (<b>self-inspection)</b> or close kin (familial imprinting), with which to compare the MHC identity of potential mates. Although studies on MHC-dependent mating preferences often assume that individuals use <b>self-inspection,</b> laboratory experiments with male mice indicate that they use familial imprinting, i. e. males learn the MHC identity of their family and then avoid mating with females carrying `familial ' MHC alleles. To determine if female mice use familial imprinting, we cross-fostered wild-derived female mouse pups into MHC-dissimilar families, and then tested if this procedure reversed their mating preferences compared with in-fostered controls. Our observations of the female's mating behaviour in seminatural social conditions and the genetic typing of their progeny both indicated that females avoided mating with males carrying MHC genes of their foster family, supporting the familial imprinting hypothesis. We show that MHC-dependent familial imprinting potentially provides a more e¡ective mechanism for avoiding kin matings and reducing inbreeding than <b>self-inspection...</b>|$|E

In addition to this, the report also identify which standards the regulatory authority can demand of identified deficiencies, {{as well as an}} examination in how the status of oil separator are in other municipalities in Sweden. First a delimitation was made to only investigate environmentally hazardous activities such as haulage contractors. Inventories were made of a total of 12 haulage contractors, with questions from a previously made checklist. The results of the inventory indicated deficiencies in operators existing knowledge, regular <b>self-inspection</b> of oil separators, control frequency, record-keeping and documentation, lack of 5 -year inspection and lack of oil- and sludge level alarm. This report also shows that regulatory authority can require the operators to rectify these deficiencies, in accordance with standards and established guidelines. The report also showed similar results when compared with similar surveys of operators' <b>self-inspection</b> of oil separator, in other municipalities in Sweden. The study suggests that regulatory authority should priority to oversight these environmentally hazardous activities with oil separators...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{strategy}} by which an automaton can examine itself to obtain a complete description of its own constituent structure. This strategy is here employed to show that machine self-reproduction by means of <b>self-inspection</b> is possible. Since the parent automaton structure serves as the sole model for the structure of offspring, the result shows {{that there is a}} logically consistent strategy of self-reproduction in which any acquired structural characteristics of parent could perforce be transmitted to the offspring. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract：Aiming at {{the problem}} of the lack of a type of {{ordnance}} equipment unit fault location method and based on µC/GUI embedded graphical user interface, a new detection and diagnosis system is designed, which integrates <b>self-inspection,</b> spare part detection, real equipment detection and teaching into one. The system adopts C 8051 F 020 MCU and S 3 C 2440 ARM 9 microprocessor, combines the application of data acquisition, LCD touch control & display, serial communications and other technologies to build the hardware system, and constructs a new menu system based on µC/GUI. 1...|$|E
40|$|To prevent oil {{and light}} liquids from causing damage at {{wastewater}} treatment facilities and the environment, a functional oil separator is important. The {{purpose of this}} study is to examine which vehicle operations have an oil separator installed and how they supervise its functionality in Arvidsjaur municipality. A questionnaire was used at the interview with all the owners with an oil separator. For those not able to participate in the interview, the same questionnaire was sent by email. The study showed that 14 of the total 15 owners had oil separator at their property and the majority of those where older ones of gravimetric type. Only 31 % had a regular <b>self-inspection</b> of the oil separator, which include control frequency of alarms, oil- and sludge level. The majority of the oil separators had been emptied at least once a year. Further the interviews indicated deficiencies in the owners existing knowledge, record-keeping and documentation. None of the oil separators had been inspected in the last 5 years. 46 % said that the oil separator lacked oil- and sludge level alarms. Results from a survey of operators <b>self-inspection</b> of oil separators in other municipalities in north of Sweden showed similar results as this study. Finally, examples of actions in accordance with standards and established guidelines are presented, which the regulatory authority may require from the owners with insufficient oil separators...|$|E
