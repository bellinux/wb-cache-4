40|$|Many {{companies}} have realized significant value {{through the application}} of lean principles to manufacturing and supply chain operations. Dell Inc. in particular garnered international fame for its ability to manufacture and deliver computers using a lean, direct-to-customer approach that provided a tremendous competitive advantage. The Author suggests that these same lean principles can be applied to improve a firm's service and support operations, while acknowledging some important nuances of applying lean in a customer service environment. The Author calls to light a key differentiator between lean manufacturing and lean customer service. Specifically, while customers use relatively consistent value systems to assess manufacturing operations, different customer segments typically value customer service in very different ways. Thus, lean customer service must begin by thoroughly characterizing the value expectations and contributions of each customer segment. After characterizing these value systems, a firm must design a <b>support</b> <b>channel</b> architecture aligned with the value exchange system of the entire customer population. After designing a lean channel architecture, lean principles may be tactically applied to optimize performance within individual channels. This research project focused on improving customer service operations at Dell by using lean principles to: 1. Establish a data-driven, strategic architecture for Dell's consumer support division and 2. Identify operational improvement opportunities to drive the tactical execution of that strategy. The project began with a benchmarking study of customer service strategies at companies such as Best Buy, Apple, Fed-Ex, Amazon. com, GM, and Comcast. (cont.) The Author then proposes a "Lean <b>Support</b> <b>Channel</b> Architecture" using on-line and retail service channels to offload demand from the call centers, effectively eliminating waste from call centers. Finally, the Author examines how lean principles can be tactically applied to a retail service channel to enable the cost-effective delivery of retail support in line with the <b>support</b> <b>channel</b> architecture proposed. by Hannah Elizabeth McClellan.

40|$|Background—Surviving myocytes within scar may form <b>channels</b> that <b>support</b> {{ventricular}} tachycardia (VT) circuits. There are little {{data on the}} properties of channels that comprise VT circuits {{and those that are}} non-VT <b>supporting</b> <b>channels.</b> Methods and Results—In 22 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and VT, high-density mapping was performed with the PentaRay catheter and Ensite NavX system during sinus rhythm. A channel was defined as a series of matching pacemaps with a stimulus (S) to QRS time of ≥ 40 ms. Sites were determined {{to be part of a}} VT channel if there were matching pace-maps to the VT morphology. This was confirmed with entrainment mapping when possible. Of the 238 channels identified, 57 channels corresponded to an inducible VT. Channels that were part of a VT circuit were more commonly located within dense scar than non-VT channels (97 % versus 82 %; P= 0. 036). VT <b>supporting</b> <b>channels</b> were of greater length (mean±SEM, 53 ± 5 versus 33 ± 4 mm), had higher longest S-QRS (130 ± 12 versus 82 ± 12 ms), longer conduction time (103 ± 14 versus 43 ± 13 ms), and slower conduction velocity (0. 87 ± 0. 23 versus 1. 39 ± 0. 21 m/s) than non-VT channels (P< 0. 001). Of all the fractionated, late, and very late potentials located in scar, only 21 %, 26 %, and 29 %, respectively, were recorded within VT channels. Conclusions—High-density mapping shows substantial differences among channels in ventricular scar. <b>Channels</b> <b>supporting</b> VT are more commonly located in dense scar, longer than non-VT channels, and have slower conduction velocity. Only a minority of scar-related potentials participate in the VT <b>supporting</b> <b>channels.</b> Sachin Nayyar, Lauren Wilson, Anand N.
