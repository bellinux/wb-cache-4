5|$|In 1900, {{ownership}} of the gatehouse was transferred from Henry Somerset, 9th Duke of Beaufort to Monmouthshire County Council {{as part of the}} disposal of the entirety of the Somersets' land holdings in Monmouthshire. The gift is recorded on a brass plaque attached to the gatehouse. The local antiquarian Mary Ellen Bagnall-Oakeley wrote the first history of the bridge and gatehouse, Monnow Bridge Tower, which appeared in 1903. In April 1893, the first <b>street</b> <b>light</b> had been erected on the bridge by the town council. In the late 1920s, the top portion of this light was replaced by twin electric lamps. In the 1960s, the lamps were removed completely, and since 1991 the bridge has been floodlit.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of privileged groups {{may not be}} a complete solution to the free rider problem, however, as underproduction of the public good may still result. The <b>street</b> <b>light</b> builder, for instance, would not consider the added benefit to neighboring businesses when determining whether to erect his <b>street</b> <b>light,</b> making it possible that the <b>street</b> <b>light</b> isn't built when the cost of building is too high for the single entrepreneur even when the total benefit to all the businesses combined exceeds the cost.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} {{collective}} action shows that public goods are still produced when one individual benefits {{more from the}} public good than it costs him to produce it; examples include benefits from individual use, intrinsic motivation to produce, and business models based on selling complement goods.

A historical example could be a downtown entrepreneur who erects a <b>street</b> <b>light</b> {{in front of his}} shop to attract customers; even though there are positive external benefits to neighboring nonpaying businesses, the added customers to the paying shop provide enough revenue to cover the costs of the <b>street</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E

25|$|Another {{method of}} {{overcoming}} the free rider {{problem is to}} simply eliminate the profit incentive for free riding by buying out all the potential free riders. A property developer that owned an entire city street, for instance, would not {{need to worry about}} free riders when erecting street lights since he owns every business that could benefit from the <b>street</b> <b>light</b> without paying. Implicitly, then, the property developer would erect street lights until the marginal social benefit met the marginal social cost.

The line ran into initial problems with breakdowns, bottlenecks, and power failures, creating massive delays. Service changes to address complaints with the introduction of the T Third Street were implemented on June 30, 2007, when the K and T trains were interlined, or effectively merged into one single line with route designations changing at the entrances into the subway (T becomes K outbound at Embarcadero; K becomes T inbound at West Portal).|$|E
25|$|Muni Metro is {{the modern}} {{incarnation}} of the traditional streetcar system that had served San Francisco since the late 19th century.

40|$|This {{research}} examined whether {{provision of}} information on the environmental impact of <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> affects the acceptability and perceived social safety of reduced <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> levels. We argued that such information should particularly affect acceptability and safety judgements of individuals who value these environmental benefits, that is, those with strong biospheric values. Participants viewed virtual representations of a residential <b>street</b> where <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> levels were varied. As expected, low lighting levels were seen as more acceptable, while high lighting levels were seen as less acceptable when information on the environmental impact of <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> was provided to individuals that strongly endorsed biospheric values. Support for the expectation that these increases in acceptability of lower lighting levels would trigger a process of rationalisation leading individuals with strong biospheric values to downplay consequences opposing value-driven views was mixed. Stronger effects were found when participants could compare different lighting levels directly. The study suggests that value-congruent information on the environmental benefits of reduced <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> can increase acceptability of reduced <b>street</b> <b>lighting.</b> (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|The {{decision}} to gradually change Brisbane's <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> {{to the series}} system was taken in 1927, and the BCC decided to switch Balmoral and Coorparoo's <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> to the series system in May 1930. In a parallel circuit system, each item receives its own full voltage from the power supply, but in the series system the current flows through each item in turn, in a loop from the power source. A series <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> circuit usually consisted of about 100 lamps, and required a minimum of 2000 volts. If more lamps were added, a higher voltage was required to maintain the necessary current. If a lamp burnt out, two metal disks would carry the current and maintain the circuit. Incandescent <b>street</b> <b>lights</b> had become economically practical by 1917, and Brisbane developed its <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> system using incandescent lamps, in series. The only other towns to use the series system for <b>street</b> <b>lighting,</b> since they had AC generators, were Maryborough, Mackay, Townsville and Cairns. Other towns used incandescent lights on the parallel system.|$|R
