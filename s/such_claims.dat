5|$|Haas {{suggests}} that the labour mobilization patterns revealed by the archaeological evidence point to a unique emergence of human government, one of two alongside Sumer (or three, if Mesoamerica is included as a separate case). While in other cases, the idea of government would have been borrowed or copied, in this small group, government was invented.

5|$|In Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Dabit (2005), Sotomayor wrote a {{unanimous}} {{opinion that the}} Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 did not preempt class action claims in state courts by stockbrokers alleging misleading inducement {{to buy or sell}} stocks. The Supreme Court handed down an 8–0 decision stating that the Act did preempt <b>such</b> <b>claims,</b> thereby overruling Sotomayor's decision.|$|E
5|$|All {{this changed}} with the Libyan coup d'état of 1 September 1969 that deposed Idris and brought Muammar Gaddafi to power. Gaddafi claimed the Aouzou Strip in {{northern}} Chad, referring to an unratified treaty signed in 1935 by Italy and France (then the colonial powers of Libya and Chad, respectively). <b>Such</b> <b>claims</b> had been previously made when in 1954 Idris had tried to occupy Aouzou, but his troops were repelled by the French Colonial Forces.|$|E

5|$|Civilian {{return to}} the town was slow, with shops still {{shuttered}} on 16 December. Civilian casualty reports were conflicting: one resident claimed 15 dead bodies lay in a single street and another that his family were dead under rubble.

5|$|For example, Bina Agarwal {{and others}} have critiqued the {{mainstream}} model and helped provide {{a better understanding of}} intra-household bargaining power. Agarwal shows that a lack of power and outside options for women hinders their ability to negotiate within their families.

These feminist economists argue that <b>such</b> <b>claims</b> have important economic outcomes which must be recognized within economic frameworks.|$|E
5|$|However, {{independent}} reviews {{have called}} into question the methodology of those growth estimates, pointing to factual inconsistencies.

5|$|It is {{probably}} worth noting, {{if only to}} avoid confusion, that <b>such</b> <b>claims</b> (much like those made by spiritualists that conjurors were unable to explain the phenomena) were often unfounded. For example, spiritualists claimed that Robert-Houdin {{had been unable to}} explain what happened at a Home seance, and critics claimed that Home had refused an invitation to perform in front of Robert-Houdin. There is, however, not a shred of evidence for either of these claims.|$|E
5|$|On April 27, nine of {{the fallen}} militants were buried in Erec. Some 400 ethnic Albanians {{attended}} their funerals. The dead {{ranged in age from}} seventeen to forty-five years old.

5|$|Periyar {{claimed that}} Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada {{came from the}} same mother {{language}} of Old Tamil. He explained that the Tamil language is called by four different names since it is spoken in four different Dravidian states. Nevertheless, current understanding of Dravidian languages contains statements contradicting <b>such</b> <b>claims.</b> For example, the currently known classification of Dravidian languages provides the following distinct classes: Southern (including Tamil–Kannada (Malayalam) and Tulu); Central (including Telugu–Kui and Kolami–Parji); and, Northern (including Kurukh–Malto and Brahui). Additionally, statements on the presence of evidence for linking Dravidian languages and Indo-European languages are available.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, the California {{legislature}} {{passed a}} statute authorizing the California Attorney General to bring claims {{on behalf of}} the tribes in the Court of Claims. The next year, Congress passed a statute granting that court jurisdiction for <b>such</b> <b>claims.</b> California Attorney General Earl Warren (future Chief Justice) finally argued the case in 1941. The court found liability but indicated it would not award pre-judgment interest, and the Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari. Warren negotiated a $5M settlement. After the passage of the Indian Claims Commission Act, the same group of tribes struggled to bring a single action for recovery under the broader claims allowed under the ICCA, which settled for $29M.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Vietnam was {{estimated}} to have about 100,000 troops in Kampuchea, but, sensing that a diplomatic settlement was within reach, the Vietnamese Government began withdrawing forces in earnest. Between April and July 1989, 24,000 Vietnamese soldiers returned home. Then, between 21 and 26 September 1989, after suffering 15,000 soldiers killed and another 30,000 wounded during the 10-year occupation, Vietnam’s commitment to Kampuchea was officially over, when the remaining 26,000 Vietnamese soldiers were pulled out. However, armed resistance groups opposed to the Vietnamese-installed PRK regime claimed that Vietnamese troops were still operating on Kampuchean soil long after September 1989. For example, non-communist groups engaging in land-grab operations in western Kampuchea after the withdrawal reported clashes with elite Vietnamese Special Forces near Tamar Puok along Route 69. Then, in March 1991, Vietnamese units {{were reported to have}} re-entered Kampot Province to defeat a Khmer Rouge offensive. Despite <b>such</b> <b>claims,</b> on 23 October 1991, the Vietnamese Government signed the Paris Peace Agreement, which aimed to restore peace in Kampuchea.|$|E

25|$|Rashi was an {{only child}} born at Troyes, Champagne, in {{northern}} France. His mother's brother was Simon the Elder, Rabbi of Mainz. Simon was a disciple of Rabbeinu Gershom Meor HaGolah, who died that same year.

In his voluminous writings, Rashi himself made no <b>such</b> <b>claim</b> at all.

5|$|In March 1994, the Washington Agreement was signed, {{ending the}} Croat–Bosniak War, and {{providing}} Croatia with US military advisors from Military Professional Resources Incorporated (MPRI).

MPRI trained HV officers and personnel for 14 weeks from January to April 1995.

5|$|Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche criticised all {{contemporary}} moral systems, with {{a special}} focus on Christian and Kantian ethics. He argued that all modern ethical systems share two problematic characteristics: first, they make a metaphysical claim {{about the nature of}} humanity, which must be accepted for the system to have any normative force; and second, the system benefits the interests of certain people, often over those of others. Although Nietzsche's primary objection is not that metaphysical claims about humanity are untenable (he also objected to ethical theories that do not make <b>such</b> <b>claims),</b> his two main targets—Kantianism and Christianity—do make metaphysical claims, which therefore feature prominently in Nietzsche's criticism.|$|E

5|$|Several Scottish clans {{that were}} {{historically}} seated on Lewis {{have traditionally been}} ascribed a descent from Óláfr.

5|$|The Belgian {{surrender}} {{came into}} effect at 04:00 on 28 May. Recriminations abounded with the British and French claiming the Belgians had betrayed the alliance. In Paris, the French Premier Paul Reynaud denounced Leopold's surrender, and the Belgian Premier Hubert Pierlot informed {{the people that}} Leopold had taken action against the unanimous advice of the government. As a result, the king {{was no longer in}} a position to govern and the Belgian government in exile that was located in Paris (later moved to London following the fall of France) would continue the struggle. The chief complaint was that the Belgians had not given any prior warning that their situation was so serious as to capitulate. <b>Such</b> <b>claims</b> were largely unjust. The Allies had known, and admitted it privately on 25 May through contact with the Belgians, that the latter {{were on the verge of}} collapse.|$|E
5|$|Villagers in {{northern}} Albania and western Kosovo reported hearing explosions {{in the vicinity}} of the ambush and seeing helicopters flying overhead for much of the following day. Albanian officials later alleged that two of these helicopters had violated the country's airspace, and Albania moved elite army units to the Yugoslav border in response. Yugoslav authorities accused Albania of backing the KLA. In response to the ambush, U.S. officials indicated that they would push for sanctions to be re-implemented against Yugoslavia, and said they would look to freeze the country's assets overseas. Some Albanian sources alleged that the men had not been ambushed, rather they were abducted and killed by Yugoslav security forces. <b>Such</b> <b>claims</b> could not be verified by Western journalists, and later that year, Amnesty International affirmed that the men were killed in an ambush while smuggling weapons across the border.|$|E
