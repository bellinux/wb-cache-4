500|$|The {{specifications}} of the Academy's {{building committee}} {{called for a}} large number of carrels (the library has 210) and for the carrels to be placed near windows so they could receive natural light. The latter point matched Kahn's personal inclinations perfectly because he himself strongly preferred natural light: [...] "He is also known to have worked by a window, refusing to switch on an electric light even on the darkest of days." [...] Each pair of carrels has a large window above, and each individual carrel has a small window at desk height with a <b>sliding</b> <b>panel</b> for adjusting the light.|$|E
2500|$|The Battle was {{furnished}} {{with a single}} cockpit to accommodate a crew of three, these typically being a pilot, observer/navigator and radio operator/air gunner. The pilot and gunner were seated in a tandem arrangement in the cockpit, the pilot being located in the forwards position controlling the fixed [...]303 Browning machine gun mounted in the starboard wing, while the gunner was in the rear position where he could use the manually aimed [...]303 Vickers K machine gun. The observers position, {{who served as the}} bomb aimer, was situated directly beneath the pilot's seat; sighting was performed in the prone position through a <b>sliding</b> <b>panel</b> in the floor of the fuselage using the Mk. VII Course Setting Bomb Sight. Complete with a continuous glazed canopy, the cockpit of the Battle had several similarities to that of a large fighter rather than a bomber.|$|E
2500|$|Wolfe's office becomes nearly {{soundproof}} {{when the}} doors connecting it to the front room and the hallway are closed. There is a small hole in the office wall covered by what Archie calls a [...] "trick picture of a waterfall." [...] A person in an alcove {{at the end of}} the hallway can open a <b>sliding</b> <b>panel</b> covering the hole, so as to see and hear conversations and other events in the office without being noticed. The chair behind Wolfe's desk is custom-built, with special springs to hold his weight; according to Archie, it is the only chair that Wolfe really enjoys sitting in. Near the desk is a large chair upholstered in red leather, which is usually reserved for Inspector Cramer, a current or prospective client, or the person whom Wolfe and Archie want to question. In the short story [...] "The Squirt and the Monkey," [...] Wolfe and Archie have a hidden tape recorder and microphone installed in the office, with controls in the kitchen. In the story [...] "Eeny Meeny Murder Mo," [...] the system is modified to transmit sound to a speaker in the front room.|$|E

60|$|Leaving the king's presence, {{the lads}} {{went into the}} city. Van Voorden had showed them how the <b>sliding</b> <b>panel</b> might be opened from the outside. Already the city had resumed its usual appearance, and the people were going about their business. They {{therefore}} found {{the door of the}} house opposite Van Voorden's standing open. Waiting until they saw that no one was near, they entered, opened the <b>sliding</b> <b>panel,</b> and, closing it carefully behind them, descended the stairs. On reaching the iron door Edgar gave three knocks, the signal that they had arranged with the Fleming. It was opened at once.|$|E
50|$|The 4-seater saloons were {{provided}} with a Weymann fabric body built by Rover under licence at Parkside. A standard Paris body with a folding roof was rebranded Riviera. The saloon windows were given double <b>sliding</b> <b>panels</b> for ventilation.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is a two-story building, five bays wide and two bays deep. Inside the shingled structure, there are <b>sliding</b> <b>panels</b> which divide the men's and women's portions of the building. As with most meeting houses, there are two front doors, one for each gender.|$|R
50|$|A box-bed is a bed {{having the}} form of a large box with wooden roof, sides, and ends, opening in front with two <b>sliding</b> <b>panels</b> or shutters; often used in cottages in Scotland: {{sometimes}} also applied to a bed arranged to fold up into a box.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the middle}} of the gate, just {{opposite}} my face, there was a small <b>sliding</b> <b>panel,</b> not more than a few inches long; this was presently pushed aside from within. I saw, through a bit of iron grating, two dull, light gray eyes staring vacantly at me, and heard a feeble husky voice saying: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ana, I {{begin to}} think you keep your counsel ill. At least I should think so, were it not that you have {{had no time to}} tell what the Princess yonder may have said to you, and can {{scarcely}} know the trick of the <b>sliding</b> <b>panel</b> in that wall which I have never shown to you." ...|$|E
60|$|Besides Fifine Beck's mother, another {{power had}} {{a word to}} say to M. Paul and me, before that {{covenant}} of friendship could be ratified. We were under the surveillance of a sleepless eye: Rome watched jealously her son through that mystic lattice at which I had knelt once, and to which M. Emanuel drew nigh month by month--the <b>sliding</b> <b>panel</b> of the confessional.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{the fort}} {{consisted}} of two gates on opposite sides and two bastions at opposite angles of the fort, each mounted with 3 1/2-inch brass cannons. Embrasures in the stockade, which were covered with bullet-proof <b>sliding</b> <b>panels,</b> were made for the cannons and swivel guns.|$|R

5000|$|The Weinbergkirche is a simple, modern construction. <b>Sliding</b> <b>panels</b> make it {{possible}} to use the minimalistic church room for a variety of purposes and for both small and large-scale events. The ground floor also includes the parish offices; the cellar contains a room for youth events and a large communal room.|$|R
60|$|Our binnacle, by the way, {{the place}} that holds a ship's compasses, deserves a word of mention. It was a little house, about the bigness of a common bird-cage, with <b>sliding</b> <b>panel</b> doors, and two drawing-rooms within, and {{constantly}} perched upon a stand, {{right in front of}} the helm. It had two chimney stacks to carry off the smoke of the lamp that burned in it by night.|$|E
60|$|When Sir Geoffrey Peveril, having {{dismissed}} Whitaker and his sentinels, {{entered the}} gilded chamber, {{in which he}} expected to find his captive, the prisoner had escaped, and {{it was easy to}} see in what manner. The <b>sliding</b> <b>panel</b> had, in the hurry of the moment, escaped the memory of Lady Peveril, and of Whitaker, the only persons who knew anything of it. It was probable that a chink had remained open, sufficient to indicate its existence to Bridgenorth; who withdrawing it altogether, had found his way into the secret apartment with which it communicated, and from thence to the postern of the Castle by another secret passage, which had been formed in the thickness of the wall, as is not uncommon in ancient mansions; the lords of which were liable to so many mutations of fortune, that they usually contrived to secure some lurking place and secret mode of retreat from their fortresses. That Bridgenorth had discovered and availed himself of this secret mode of retreat was evident; because the private doors communicating with the postern and the <b>sliding</b> <b>panel</b> in the gilded chamber were both left open.|$|E
60|$|Fortunately I woke {{early next}} morning, for I {{was now a}} member of an early-rising family, and anxious to conform to rules. On going to the door I found, to my inexpressible disgust, that I might easily have closed it in the way I had seen the other door closed, by simply pulling a <b>sliding</b> <b>panel.</b> There was {{ventilation}} enough without having the place open to prowling beasts of prey. I also found that if I had turned up the little stray bed I should have had warm woolen sheets to sleep in.|$|E
50|$|A {{lot of his}} {{paintings}} are still preserved in temples at Kyoto. His paintings are on the panels of Reiun-in monastery in Kyoto. Motonobu did the principal rooms in the monastery. Motonobu's paintings {{that were on the}} <b>sliding</b> <b>panels</b> are now mounted on hanging scrolls. These include 49 Landscapes with Flowers and Birds.|$|R
40|$|Japanese export puzzles have {{introduced}} {{millions of people}} to trick opening boxes, banks and interlocking puzzles. Trick boxes, beautifully veneered with a wood mosaic called “yoseki”, require <b>sliding</b> <b>panels</b> to be moved in sequence until the top or bottom lid can slide open. Some boxes require fifty or more moves to open. Japanes...|$|R
50|$|The saloon's {{windscreen}} is V-shaped. The {{side windows}} have two <b>sliding</b> <b>panels,</b> two winding panels and fixed panels {{at the rear}} of the six-light body. The Weymann saloon's front seat is slidable by hand. The spare wheel is carried at the back of the body in front of the folding luggage grid.|$|R
6000|$|The peasant's cot {{is of the}} simplest, {{and those}} in the {{plantations}} suggest African huts. Even the best houses, except when copied from the English, are scantily furnished; and little beyond a roof is absolutely wanted. The home of the cazeiro, or peasant tenant practically irremovable, is whitewashed and thatched, the straw forming a crest along the ridge. It covers only one room, converted by a curtain into 'but' and 'ben.' A parental bed, a rickety table, and two or three stools or settles compose the necessaries; the ornaments are the saints hanging to the walls, and for windows there are shutters with a <b>sliding</b> <b>panel.</b> The feeding apparatus consists of a kind of quern for grinding corn, especially maize, ...|$|E
60|$|And {{she does}} it. And there's no fake blank {{cartridges}} or assistants pulling strings. Helen fires. The bullet--the actual bullet--goes through {{the face of}} the photograph--and then strikes the hidden spring of the <b>sliding</b> <b>panel</b> in the wall--and lo! the panel slides, and there is the missing $647,000 in convincing stacks of currency and bags of gold. It's great. You know how it is. Cherry practised for two months at a target on the roof of her boarding house. It took good shooting. In the sketch she had to hit a brass disk only three inches in diameter, covered by wall paper in the panel; and she had to stand in exactly the same spot every night, and the photo had to be in exactly the same spot, and she had to shoot steady and true every time.|$|E
60|$|Juanna {{considered}} the position rapidly. It was hopeless and cruel. Nam and Soa were {{on either side}} of her, the latter standing near the door with the <b>sliding</b> <b>panel</b> beyond which Leonard lay bound, and she knew well that did she speak a single word of the truth to Olfan, it would be the signal for her lover's death. It was possible that the king might be able to protect her own person from violence, but if Leonard died it mattered little what became of her. There was but one thing that she could do--declare herself willing to become the wife of Olfan. Yet it seemed shameless thus to treat this honourable man, the only friend that they had found among the People of the Mist. But of a truth, such necessities as hers cannot wait while those in their toils weigh scruples or the law of honour.|$|E

2500|$|The large halls were {{separated}} by <b>sliding</b> <b>panels</b> which could be drawn back to create a single space of about 2,900 sq ft. which was used for social events and public meetings.

6000|$|The great {{event of}} the day was over now with Blanche, and she greatly enjoyed {{wandering}} about with Hector and Tom. There was a post-office at Miss Cleveland's stall, where, on paying sixpence, a letter could be obtained to the address of the inquirer. Blanche had been very anxious to try, but Flora had pronounced it nonsense; however, Hector declared that Flora was not his master, tapped at the <b>sliding</b> <b>panel,</b> and charmed Blanche by what she thought a most witty parody of his name as Achilles Lionsrock, Esquire. When the answer came from within, [...] "Ship letter, sir, double postage," [...] they thought it almost uncanny; and Hector's shilling was requited by something so like a real ship letter, that they had some idea that the real post had somehow transported itself thither. The interior was decidedly oracular, consisting of this one line, [...] "I counsel you to persevere in your laudable undertaking." ...|$|E
60|$|Edward {{had lived}} at Glennaquoich {{long enough to}} be aware of a {{distinction}} which he had repeatedly heard noticed, and now satisfied that he had no interest with his attendants, he glanced a disconsolate eye around the interior of the cabin. The only furniture, excepting a washing-tub and a wooden press, called in Scotland an ambry, sorely decayed, was a large wooden bed, planked, as is usual, all around, and opening by a <b>sliding</b> <b>panel.</b> In this recess the Highlanders deposited Waverley, after he had by signs declined any refreshment. His slumbers were broken and unrefreshing; strange visions passed before his eyes, and it required constant and reiterated efforts of mind to dispel them. Shivering, violent headache, and shooting pains in his limbs succeeded these symptoms; and in the morning it was evident to his Highland attendants or guard, for he knew not in which light to consider them, that Waverley was quite unfit to travel.|$|E
60|$|The {{permission}} was obtained, and we proceeded {{at once to}} the Rue Morgue. This is one {{of those}} miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the Rue Richelieu and the Rue St. Roch. It was late in the afternoon when we reached it; as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we resided. The house was readily found; for there were still many persons gazing up at the closed shutters, with an objectless curiosity, from {{the opposite side of the}} way. It was an ordinary Parisian house, with a gateway, on one side of which was a glazed watch-box, with a <b>sliding</b> <b>panel</b> in the window, indicating a loge de concierge. Before going in we walked up the street, turned down an alley, and then, again turning, passed in the rear of the building--Dupin, meanwhile examining the whole neighborhood, as well as the house, with a minuteness of attention for which I could see no possible object.|$|E
