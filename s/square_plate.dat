These were shell-lac, sulphur, fused and cast borate of lead, flint glass well-covered with a film of lac, and spermaceti. The {{following}} was the form of experiment with sulphur, and all were of the same kind. A <b>square</b> <b>plate</b> of the substance, two inches in extent and 0.6 of an inch in thickness, was cast with a small hole or depression {{in the middle of}} one surface to receive the carrier ball. This was placed upon the surface of the metal hemisphere (fig. 112.) arranged on the excited lac as in former cases, and observations were made at n, o, p, and q. Great care was required in these experiments to free the sulphur or other solid substance from any charge it might previously have received. This was done by breathing and wiping (1203.), and the substance being found free from all electrical excitement, was then used in the experiment; after which it was removed and again examined, to ascertain that it had received no charge, but had acted really as a dielectric. With all these precautions the results were the same: and it is thus very satisfactory to obtain the curved inductive action through solid bodies, as any possible effect from the translation of charged particles in fluids or gases, which some persons might imagine to be the case, is here entirely negatived.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTMeasurement of {{inhibition}} zones by {{the automated}} OSIRIS system was compared with manual measurement. In total, 14 176 measurements {{were made with}} 352 staphylococcal and 80 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, involving four panels of antibiotics on round and <b>square</b> Mueller–Hinton agar <b>plates,</b> according to the German DIN 58940 recommendations. Variations of ± 3 mm in zone size measurements were defined as tolerable. Very major errors (i. e., classification of a resistant isolate as susceptible by the OSIRIS system) occurred in < 1 % of tests. With staphylococci, the best concordance was recorded for rifampicin (91. 3 %), moxifloxacin (88. 1 %), and gentamicin (86. 3 %), while the concordance on <b>square</b> <b>plates</b> for vancomycin, pristinamycin and kanamycin was 97. 2 %, 96. 1 % and 96. 0 %, respectively. The poorest concordance was for cefuroxime (43. 7 %) and novobiocin (47. 0 %) on round plates, and fosfomycin (36. 5 %) and chloramphenicol (84. 0 %) on <b>square</b> <b>plates.</b> With Enterobacteriaceae, 100 % concordance was recorded for ampicillin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin on round agar plates, and for gentamicin, cefoxitin and nalidixic acid on <b>square</b> <b>plates.</b> The poorest results were recorded for nalidixic acid (32. 5 %) and piperacillin (82. 5 %) on round plates, and for nitrofurantoin (72. 5 %) and amoxycillin (82. 5 %) on <b>square</b> <b>plates.</b> It was concluded that the OSIRIS system was a rapid and reliable system for measuring disk susceptibility test results on round and <b>square</b> agar <b>plates...</b>|$|R

ANSYS commercial finite element software {{had been used in}} the study. The applied inplane load considered is uniaxial compression. In all the cases the load is distributed uniformly along the simply supported or clamped outer edges. The degree of eccentricity and the plate thickness ratio are the major factors. In the present study influence of different plate edge conditions, (SSSS, CCCC and SCSC), with cutout eccentricity along x, y and in diagonal directions and different plate thickness ratios on the buckling strength of the perforated <b>square</b> <b>plates</b> are investigated...|$|R

The effects of various parameters like {{the increase in}} static load factor {{and the degree of}} orthotropy of simply supported composite plates at elevated temperatures and moisture concentrations on the principal instability regions are investigated using finite element method. The effects of transverse shear deformation and rotary inertia are used to study the antisymmetric angle-ply <b>square</b> <b>plates.</b> A simple laminated plate model is developed for the parametric instability of <b>square</b> laminated <b>plates</b> subjected to hygrothermal loading. A computer program based on FEM in MATLAB environment is developed to perform all necessary computations. The results show that instability of <b>square</b> laminated <b>plates</b> occurs for different parameters with an increase in temperature and moisture environment. The onset of instability occurs earlier, and the width of dynamic instability regions increases with a rise in temperature and moisture for different parameters. The effect of damping shows that there is a finite critical value of dynamic load factor for each instability region below which the <b>square</b> laminated <b>plates</b> cannot become unstable...|$|R
