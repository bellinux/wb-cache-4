40|$|Two-component spinors are {{the basic}} {{ingredients}} for describing fermions in quantum field theory in four space-time dimensions. We develop and review the techniques of the two-component spinor formalism and provide {{a complete set of}} Feynman rules for fermions using two-component spinor notation. These rules are suitable for practical calculations of cross-sections, decay rates, and radiative corrections in the Standard Model and its extensions, including supersymmetry, and many explicit examples are provided. The unified treatment presented in this review applies to massless Weyl fermions and massive Dirac and Majorana fermions. We exhibit the relation between the two-component spinor formalism and the more traditional four-component spinor formalism, and indicate their connections to the spinor helicity method and techniques for the computation of helicity amplitudes.

40|$|Conventional debuggers provide {{primitives}} {{for controlling}} one computer {{process at the}} time. Relative debuggers extend the capabilities of conventional debuggers {{by being able to}} control two or more processes at once and by providing primitives for comparing the states of these processes. The processes can run on the same computer or on different computers, connected by a network. The processes can differ in their source programming language, in their mode of execution (sequential, parallel, vector), or in implementation details. One of the processes usually serves as a <b>reference</b> <b>version</b> which produces the desired results. The execution of the other process is compared to the <b>reference</b> <b>version</b> in order to find discrepancies.

50|$|As ASCII did {{not provide}} a number of {{characters}} needed for languages other than English, a number of national variants were made that substituted some less-used characters with needed ones. Due to the incompatibility of the various national variants, an International <b>Reference</b> <b>Version</b> (IRV) of ISO/IEC 646 was introduced, {{in an attempt to}} at least restrict the replaced set to the same characters in all variants. The original version (ISO 646 IRV) differed from ASCII only in that in code point 0x24, ASCII's dollar sign ($) was replaced by the international currency symbol (¤). The final 1991 version of the code ISO 646:1991 is also known as ITU T.50, International Reference Alphabet or IRA, formerly International Alphabet No. 5 (IA5). This standard allows users to exercise the 12 variable characters (i.e., two alternative graphic characters and 10 national defined characters).
