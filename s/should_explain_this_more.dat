40|$|Energy demand since 1986 seems {{inconsistent}} {{with the notion of}} constant income and price elasticities reported in the literature. Energy demand growth remained sluggish despite the simultaneous substantial reduction in real fuel costs and increases in real income. This investigation differentiates, as it were, two different price effects that <b>should</b> <b>explain</b> <b>this</b> apparent asymmetry in energy demand. The first effect is embedded in the technical efficiency and therefore largely irreversible. The second effect revolves around consumers' decisions and hence is reversible. This dichotomy of the price effect provides a suitable framework to study energy demand (in this instance, road transport). Moreover, the projections and policy recommendations following from this framework differ from the standard symmetric specification. Moderate price increases will affect consumers' behaviour, while only sufficiently high gasoline prices will trigger further efficiency improvements. The present low growth rates of energy demand mask a much higher growth at the service level, therefore energy demand growth may accelerate as these efficiency gains die out (if price levels or price expectations remain low). ...|$|R

40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{research}} {{has been carried out}} recently in the field of volume gratings recorded in photopolymer material. The existence of different models that predict the mechanism of hologram formation inside photopolymers, has increased the possibilities of an accurate understanding of the processes involved inside photopolymers during the exposure process. A {{great deal of}} experimental research has been done, in order to test the theoretical assumptions. Nonetheless, there is little quantitative data available about higher harmonics components of the refractive index. This {{is due to the fact}} that, apart from a few works, Kogelnik’s coupled wave theory has been used to fit the temporal evolution of the diffraction efficiency of the first order. The use of this theory does not allow us to obtain information about higher orders and consequently about the higher harmonics in the refractive index. In this paper we apply an algorithm based in the rigorous coupled wave theory to reproduce the angular response curves of the different orders that propagate inside the hologram. This study will be done for attenuated in depth grating profiles. Experimental data for the angular responses of the first and second orders, centered at first and second on Bragg angular replay conditions, will be examined. The experimental data provided will demonstrate that attenuation occurs inside the hologram during the recording step, most probably because of Beer’s Law. The information provided in this work is significant, since future theoretical models of grating formation in photopolymers <b>should</b> <b>explain</b> <b>this</b> behaviour.

We performed a prospective multicentre study including patients with PE in order to assess the prevalence and to describe risk factors of CTEPH. Follow-up every year included an evaluation of dyspnea and echocardiography using a predefined algorithm. In case of suspected CTEPH, the diagnosis was confirmed using right heart catheterisation (RHC). Signs of CTEPH were searched on the multidetector computed tomography (CT) and echocardiography performed at the time of PE. Of the 146 patients analysed, eight patients (5. 4 %) had suspected CTEPH during a median follow-up of 26 months. CTEPH was confirmed using RHC in seven cases (4. 8 %; 95 %CI, 2. 3 - 9. 6) and ruled-out in one. Patients with CTEPH were older, had more frequently previous venous thromboembolic events and more proximal PE than those without CTEPH. At the time of PE diagnosis, patients with CTEPH had a higher systolic pulmonary artery pressure and at least two signs of CTEPH on the initial CT.

40|$|Research {{involving}} event-related brain potentials {{has revealed}} that anxiety is associated with enhanced error monitoring, as reflected in increased amplitude of the error-related negativity (ERN). The {{nature of the relationship}} between anxiety and error monitoring is unclear, however.

Although, overall, anxiety demonstrated a robust, "small-to-medium" relationship with enhanced ERN (r = - 0. 25), studies employing measures of anxious apprehension show a threefold greater effect size estimate (r = - 0. 35) than those utilizing other measures of anxiety (r = - 0. 09). Our conceptual framework helps <b>explain</b> <b>this</b> <b>more</b> specific relationship between anxiety and enhanced ERN and delineates the unique roles of worry, conflict processing, and modes of cognitive control.
