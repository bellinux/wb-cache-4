50|$|<b>Superregeneration</b> is most {{valuable}} above 27 MHz, and for signals where broad tuning is desirable. The superregen uses many fewer components for {{nearly the same}} sensitivity as more complex designs. It is easily possible to build superregen receivers which operate at microwatt power levels, in the 30 to 6,000 MHz range. It removes {{the need for the}} operator to manually adjust regeneration level to just below the point of oscillation - the circuit automatically is taken out of oscillation periodically, but with the disadvantage that small amounts of interference may be a problem for others. These are ideal for remote-sensing applications or where long battery life is important. For many years, superregenerative circuits have been used for commercial products such as garage-door openers, radar detectors, microwatt RF data links, and very low cost walkie-talkies.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{receiver}} front end that makes use of the baseband <b>superregeneration</b> principle to detect ultrawideband (UWB) impulse radio signals. The UWB antenna is directly connected to the core circuit consisting of a resistor-capacitor (RC) network coupled to a negative resistance that varies {{under the control of}} an external quench generator. Due to a step-recovery-diode quench shaper, 50 -ps time-domain sensitivity windows are generated that filter the received pulses and reject noise and interference. The circuit achieves high gain, exhibits automatic gain control, and directly demodulates binary phase modulations. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe general method of amplification by periodically quenching an unstable system {{under the influence}} of an input signal is investigated by the use of mathematical calculation, digital computation and experimental verification. This type of amplification, of which <b>superregeneration</b> is just one specialized form, is specifically analyzed for electrical systems which can be made unstable with time invarient elements. Specific results from the investigation of a system described by a first order differential equation reveals the physical realizability of an amplificatory mode of operation having unusual selectivity responses. The experimental realizability of this system was accomplished by the development of a special form of dynatron using characteristics heretofore not exploited. Specific results from the investigation of the system described by a second order differential equation revealed fundamental selectivity/ gain limitations for the linear system, a limitation which can be overcome by the use of a time varying regenerative cycle. Both systems demonstrated the capability of having a very high voltage and power gain throughout the audio and radio frequency spectrum. Finally a theoretical and experimental study of the characteristics of the superregenerative hiss (noise) is done in sufficient detail permitting two realizable systems to be developed, both which overcome the objectionable features of the superregenerative hiss[URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E
