40|$|Several {{physical}} models {{have recently been}} proposed to obtain unidirectional motion of an overdamped Brownian particle in a periodic potential system. The asymmetric ratchetlike form of the periodic potential {{and the presence of}} correlated nonequilibrium fluctuating forces are considered essential to obtain such a macroscopic motion in homogeneous systems. In the present work, instead, inhomogeneous systems are considered, wherein the friction coefficient and/or temperature could vary in space. We show that unidirectional motion can be obtained even in a symmetric nonratchetlike periodic potential system in the presence of white noise fluctuations.

The Hamiltonian {{of the system}} can be indeed manipulated by applying a magnetic eld or pressure on the sample.

The present study compared six inhomogeneity indexes calculated from the oxygen washout curves provided by the rapid oxygen sensor of the LUFU end-expiratory lung volume measurement <b>system.</b> <b>Inhomogeneity</b> was tested in a porcine model before and after induction of acute lung injury (ALI) at four different levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP; 15, 10, 5 and 0 cm H 2 O). The following indexes were assessed: lung clearance index (LCI), mixing ratio, Becklake index, multiple breath alveolar mixing inefficiency, moment ratio and pulmonary clearance delay. LCI, mixing ratio, Becklake index and moment ratio were comparable with previous reported values and showed acceptable variation coefficients at baseline with and without ALI. Moment ratio had the highest precision, as calculated by the variation coefficients. LCI, Becklake index and moment ratio showed comparable increases in inhomogeneity during decremental PEEP steps before and after ALI. The advantage of the method we introduce is the combined measurement of end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) and inhomogeneity of lung ventilation with the LUFU fast-response medical-grade oxygen sensor, without the need for external tracer gases.

40|$|International audienceConformal {{field theory}} (CFT) has been {{extremely}} successful in describing large-scale universal effects in one-dimensional (1 D) systems at quantum critical points. Unfortunately, its applicability in condensed matter physics has been limited to situations in which the bulk is uniform because CFT describes low-energy excitations around some energy scale, taken to be constant throughout the system. However, in many experimental contexts, such as quantum gases in trapping potentials and in several out-of-equilibrium situations, systems are strongly inhomogeneous. We show here that the powerful CFT methods can be extended {{to deal with such}} 1 D situations, providing a few concrete examples for non-interacting Fermi gases. The <b>system's</b> <b>inhomogeneity</b> enters the field theory action through parameters that vary with position; in particular, the metric itself varies, resulting in a CFT in curved space.

We motivate the utility of this method by designing pulses for both standard and novel applications. We also show the convergence of the pseudospectral method for optimal ensemble control.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{spectrum}} of electron density oscillations in an interacting one-dimensional electron system with an impurity. The <b>system's</b> <b>inhomogeneity</b> is characterized by different values of Fermi wave vectors $k_F=k_{L/R}$ on left/right side of the scatterer, leading to a Landauer dipole formation. We demonstrate, that while in the noninteracting system the Friedel oscillations possess only one periodicity related to the local $k_F$, say $k_L$ on the left side, the interplay of the interactions and the Landauer dipole generates an additional peak in {{the spectrum of}} density oscillations at the counterpart $k_R$. Being only present in correlated systems, the position and shape of this spectral feature, which in coordinate space is observable as a beating pattern in the Friedel oscillations, reveals many important details {{about the nature of}} interactions.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{from a variety}} of molecular simulations of phase coexistence using the well established Gay-Berne (GB) liquid crystal model. Firstly, the simulation of bulk phase coexistence using the Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo technique is presented, both for one and two-component GB systems. The one-component results, using a novel parameterisation of the GB, show a rich phase behaviour, displaying both isotropic and nematic-vapour coexistence, in good comparison with previous studies. A method for arriving at the two-component parameterisation is then discussed, followed by a novel application of the Gibbs ensemble to the isotropic-nematic transition in two-component systems. Results in broad agreement with theoretical predictions, subject to a large finite size effect, are obtained. Secondly, upon the basis of the one-component Gibbs results results {{are presented}} from a series of molecular dynamics simulations of a free standing GB film in equilibrium with its own saturated vapour. The introduction of inhomogeneity is shown to induce a preferred molecular alignment in the nematic film perpendicular to the liquid-vapour interface. At slightly higher temperatures the nematic film is wet by the isotropic phase, displaying an intermediate ordering regime where the formation of short-lived nematic domains within the film is observed. This effect has been analysed using orientational correlation functions, and shown to result from a decoupling of the planar and perpendicular nematic ordering caused by the <b>system</b> <b>inhomogeneity.</b> A system-size analysis of this effect has also been undertaken, showing a definite increase in the range of decay of these orientational correlations with increasing system size.

40|$|Many {{industrial}} {{problems that}} arise during petroleum processing {{are related to}} the high concentration of asphaltenes. A good knowledge of the chemical composition of these macromolecules and a detailed understanding of the evolution of the colloidal structures present in oil and its derivatives can play a decisive role in improving processing facilities. Asphaltenes are defined by their insolubility in n-heptane. Soluble molecules are called maltenes which can be fractionated by liquid chromatography in so-called resins, aromatic and saturated fractions. The major part of the research carried out on these complex molecules concerned the chemical composition determination from powerful techniques measurements as for instance IR or NMR methods. Nevertheless, very little information on the colloidal structure of asphaltenes or resins in pure solvent or in real systems is accessible. The molecular weight determination was the first objective; several techniques, as vapour pressure osmometry (VPO), were used. The main conclusion of these determinations was the huge variation of the molecular weight measured by different methods. We used X-ray and neutron small angle scattering techniques in order to deduce the size polydispersity and the weight average molecular weight. Different systems as (i) asphaltenes or resins in solution with different solvents, or (ii) asphaltene and resin mixtures in suspension with good or bad solvents were investigated as a function of temperature increase. We have exhibited that the aggregation number, i. e. the number of smaller entities, can strongly vary with solvent composition and temperature. Resins appear as very good solvent for asphaltene molecules. Scattering measurements often exhibit strong scattered intensity at small scattering vector, showing the presence in the suspension of large heterogeneities in diluted solutions of asphaltenes and resins. We can suggest that these heterogeneities are due to concentration fluctuations. It exists in the diluted suspension regions more or less extended, where the asphaltene concentration is greater than the average asphaltene concentration. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy has confirmed the <b>system</b> <b>inhomogeneity.</b> A two phase system was clearly highlighted.

40|$|Restricted until 24 July 2009. Recently quantum phase {{transitions}} {{have attracted}} {{the interest of}} both theorists and experimentalists in condensed matter physics. Quantum magnets provide a perfect playground for studying these phase transitions since they can be triggered by many control parameters such as frustration, lattice dimerization, and magnetic field. Most previous {{studies have focused on}} the magnetic properties in pure systems. In these systems, responses to the triggering parameters are found to be uniform, leading to homogeneous phases. However little progress has been made so far on the phase transitions and properties in disordered quantum magnets because they are more complicated systems, and few theoretical tools can be applied.; In this thesis we use the stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo method to study quantum phase transitions in disordered magnets. We find that disordered magnets can behave quite differently from pure systems. The <b>system</b> <b>inhomogeneity</b> can strongly affect phase transitions by changing their universality class. We also find order-disorder transitions are often accompanied by the appearance of novel quantum disordered phases, in which magnetic properties behave highly nontrivial, even singular.; In this thesis two examples are studied in great detail. The first one is the phase diagram of an inhomogeneous, bond-diluted two-dimensional antiferromagnet near the percolation threshold. We show that the magnetic transition can be tuned by the inhomogeneity of the dilution from a classical percolation to a quantum phase transition. Interestingly the quantum transition still takes the nature of a renormalized percolative transition, with continuously varying critical exponents. A gapless quantum disordered phase with no magnetic long-range order but geometric percolation is found. The low-temperature uniform susceptibility diverges as a non-universal power-law of the temperature in this phase, indicating that this is a quantum Griffiths phase. In the second example, we study field-induced quantum phase transitions in two-dimensional site-diluted coupled dimers. We find that an extremely small field drives the order-bydisordered phase into a quantum disordered disordered-free-moment phase. The agnetization curve in this phase shows a series of pseudo-plateaus, which {{can be explained by the}} highly inhomogeneous field response of the free moments. A spin-boson mapping reveals that the disordered-free-moment phase can be understood as a low-field Bose glass phase, and hence the associated phase transition is a realization of a twodimensional Bose-glass-to-disordered-free-moment transition. This is confirmed by the entire phase diagram and the study of the scaling behavior of correlation length, order parameter, and spin stiffness in the critical regime...|$|E
40|$|A kinetic {{equation}} for the collisional {{evolution of}} stable, bound, self gravitating and slowly relaxing systems is established, which is valid {{when the number}} of constituents is very large.

The evolution of the one-body distribution function is described in action angle space. The collision operators are expressed in terms of the collective response function allowed by the existing distribution functions at any given time and involve particles in resonant motions. The set of equations which describe the coupled evolution of the distribution functions and of the potential is derived for spherical systems. In the homogeneous limit, which sacrifices the description of the evolution of the spatial structure of the system, but retains the effects of collective gravitational dressing, the kinetic equation reduces to a form similar to the Balescu-Lenard equation of plasma physics.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve the high-fidelity quantum control needed for {{a broad range of}} quantum {{information}} technologies, reducing the effects of noise and <b>system</b> <b>inhomogeneities</b> is an essential task. It is well known that a system can be decoupled from noise or made insensitive to inhomogeneous dephasing dynamically by using carefully designed pulse sequences based on square or delta-function waveforms such as Hahn spin echo or CPMG. However, such ideal pulses are often challenging to implement experimentally with high fidelity. Here, we uncover a new geometrical framework for visualizing all possible driving fields, which enables one to generate an unlimited number of smooth, experimentally feasible pulses that perform dynamical decoupling or dynamically corrected gates to arbitrarily high order. We demonstrate that this scheme can significantly enhance the fidelity of single-qubit operations in the presence of noise and when realistic limitations on pulse rise times and amplitudes are taken into account.

For small particles models for collective reversal, either uniform (Stoner-Wohlfarth model) or non-uniform like curling, provide good agreement between theory and experiment. For microscopic objects and thin films, we consider two models, uniform (Stoner-Wohlfarth) reversal inside a nucleation volume and a droplet model, where the free energy of an inverse bubble is calculated taking into account volume energy (Zeeman energy) and surface tension (domain wall energy).

40|$|The {{kinetic model}} of a {{one-dimensional}} force-free current sheet (CS) developed recently by Harrison and Neukirch [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102 (13), 135003 (2009) ] predicts uniform distributions of the plasma temperature and density across the CS. However, in realistic physical <b>systems,</b> <b>inhomogeneities</b> of these plasma parameters may arise quite naturally due to the boundary conditions or local plasma heating. Moreover, as the CS spatial scale becomes larger than the characteristic kinetic scales (the regime {{often referred to as}} the MHD limit), it should be possible to set arbitrary density and temperature profiles. Thus, an advanced model has to allow for inhomogeneities of the macroscopic plasma parameters across the CS, to be consistent with the MHD limit. In this paper, we generalise the kinetic {{model of a}} force-free current sheet, taking into account the inhomogeneity of the density and temperature across the CS. In the developed model, the density may either be enhanced or depleted in the CS central region.
