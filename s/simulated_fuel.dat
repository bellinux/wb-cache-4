50|$|Each pit crew group (fueler and an assistant, {{the front}} tire changer and carrier as another group, the rear tire changer and carrier as another group, and the jackman) was located at {{separate}} {{stations in the}} arena. For safety reasons, the fuel cans carried nine gallons of water, about the same weight as an eleven-gallon can of racing fuel. Upon the starting signal, the jackman would lift a car {{on the right side}}, then lower the car. The tire changers would change the tires of an already-lifted simulated car on their end (front or rear). Both moves were performed on the right side first, then the left. The fueler was required to unload the 18 gallons of water into a <b>simulated</b> <b>fuel</b> tank. When their duties were finished (a NASCAR official would approve) at their time, the six crewmen (the assistant to the fueler does not participate) ran to the start of a 40-yard (36m) dash where all crewmen had to push the car {{down the length of the}} arena where the nose of the car reaching the timing beam stops the clock.|$|E

40|$|Autothermal {{reforming}} (ATR) of <b>simulated</b> <b>fuels</b> was {{studied with}} n-heptane, n-dodecane, toluene, and methylcyclohexane as model compounds for different fractions {{of gasoline and}} diesel on zirconia-supported Rh and Pt. A performance comparison was made on commercial nickel catalyst. No inhibiting effect was observed between the hydrocarbons on any catalyst, even though aliphatic hydrocarbons are more reactive than aromatics. The product selectivities obtained in ATR of <b>simulated</b> <b>fuels</b> could be calculated from the selectivities obtained in ATR of single hydrocarbons. ATR of fuels has to be operated at high temperatures, which promotes thermal cracking. To prevent these side reactions active and selective catalysts are needed. The Rh/ZrO 2 catalyst showed high ATR activity and selectivity. Moreover, less coke was accumulated on the zirconia-supported noble metal catalysts than on the commercial nickel catalyst. Some deactivation of the rhodium and nickel catalysts was, however, observed...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to study the aerodynamic characteristics of the confined, non-reacting, swirling flow field. The flow was generated by a helicoidal axial-vaned swirler with a short internal convergent-divergent venturi, which was confined within 2 -inch square test section. A series of helicoidal axial-vaned swirlers have been designed with tip vane angles of 40 deg., 45 deg., 50 deg., 55 deg., 60 deg. and 65 deg [...] The swirler with the tip vane angle of 60 deg. was combined with several <b>simulated</b> <b>fuel</b> nozzle insertions of varying lengths. A two-component Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) system was employed to measure the three-component mean velocities and Reynolds stresses. Detailed data are provided to enhance understanding swirling flow with different swirl degrees and geometries and to support {{the development of more}} accurate physicaVnumerica 1 models.

40|$|Polymer {{electrolyte}} membrane (PEM) {{fuel cell}} stack requires gaskets and seals in each cell to keep the reactant gases (hydrogen and oxygen) within their respective regions. The stability of the gaskets/seals {{is critical to the}} operating life as well as the electrochemical performance of the fuel cell. The time-dependant chemical and mechanical degradation of two commercially available silicones-based elastomeric gasket materials in a <b>simulated</b> <b>fuel</b> cell environment was investigated in this work. Two temperatures based on actual fuel cell operation were selected and used in this study. Using optical microscopy, the topographical damage on the sample surface due to the acidic environment was revealed. Atomic adsorption spectrometer analysis shows that silicon, calcium, and magnesium were leached from the materials into the soaking solution. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to study the surface chemistry of the elastomeric gasket materials before and after exposure to the <b>simulated</b> <b>fuel</b> cell environment over time. The ATR-FTIR and XPS test results indicate that the surface chemistry changed significantly and the chemical degradation mechanism is de-crosslinking and chain scission in the backbone.

After the electrolysis, the residual salt of the cathode basket containing the reduction product was drained by placing it at gas phase above the molten salt using a holder. Then, at a room temperature, the complete separation of the reduction product from the cathode basket was achieved by inverting it without damaging or deforming the basket.

Constant potential was used to <b>simulate</b> <b>fuel</b> cell run, rest and idle, and constant current was used to simulate the start-up and shut-down events. Over the course of an experiment, the catalyst would experience potential as low as 0. 650 VRHE (run) and as high as 1. 53 – 1. 8 VRHE (dependent on the behavior of the composition) under the galvanostatic holds. All compositions including either Ir or Ru lasted significantly longer than for pure Pt under repeated start-up/shut-down. The stability of the over-layer Ir-Pt compositions was significantly higher than for the co-sputtered deposition. The compositions containing 9 and 22 μg cm− 2 Ir over-layer on Pt showed no ORR activity decrease over the course of 1400 SU/SD simulations (2800 potential peaks> 1. 5 VRHE). © 2014 The Electrochemical Society.

40|$|Abstract. Biomass burning {{is one of}} {{the largest}} sources of at-mospheric trace gases and {{aerosols}} globally. These emissions have a major impact on the radiative balance of the atmo-sphere and on air quality, and are thus of significant scientific and societal interest. Several datasets have been developed that quantify those emissions on a global grid and offered to the atmospheric modelling community. However, no study has yet attempted to systematically quantify the dependence of the inferred pyrogenic emissions on underlying assump-tions and input data. Such a sensitivity study is needed for understanding how well we can currently model those emis-sions and what the factors are that contribute to uncertainties in those emission estimates.

40|$|The {{available}} oxygen potential data of LWR-fuels by the EFM-method have been reviewed and compared with thermodynamic data of equivalent <b>simulated</b> <b>fuels</b> and mixed oxide systems, {{combined with the}} analysis of lattice parameter data. Up to burn-ups of 70 ¿ 80 GWd/tM the comparison confirmed traditional predictions anticipating the fuels to remain quasi stoichiometric along irradiation. However, recent predictions of a fuel with average burn-up around 100 GWd/tM becoming definitely hypostoichiometric were not confirmed. At average burn-ups around 80 GWd/tM and above, it is shown that the fuels tend to acquire progressively slightly hyperstoichiometric O/M ratios. The maximum derived O/M ratio for an average burn-up of 100 GWd/tM lies around 2. 001 and 2. 002.
