Compounds produced by AA 2 pyrolysis were compared to compounds detected in the gaseous effluent from AA <b>2</b> <b>incineration.</b> The light permanent gases and most of the higher molecular weight byproducts produced by AA <b>2</b> <b>incineration</b> are replicated by laboratory pyrolysis on AA 2. The reverse case also holds whereby 18 out of 24 high molecular weight AA 2 pyrolytic byproducts are found in the incinerator emissions. Poor matching, however, was obtained between the two processes for the volatile, water-soluble species. None of these low molecular weight compounds produced under pyrolytic conditions were detected in the AA 2 incinerator samples, likely indicating inefficient capture of these compounds from the effluent stream. Separate pyrolytic degradation of the individual components of AA 2 provides evidence that nearly all of the incomplete combustion products detected during incineration originate not from the prevalent energetic ingredients but rather from the minor and trace additives in AA 2. In addition, pyrolysis successfully identified the AA 2 components capable of surviving the incineration process intact.

In particular, the histone H 3 lysine 36 (K 36) methyltransferase <b>Set</b> <b>2</b> {{has recently been}} shown to associate with the phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), implying that this enzyme has {{an important role in}} the transcription elongation process. Here we show that a novel domain in the C terminus of <b>Set</b> <b>2</b> is responsible for interaction between <b>Set</b> <b>2</b> and RNAPII. This domain, termed the <b>Set</b> <b>2</b> Rpb 1 interacting (SRI) domain, is encompassed by amino acid residues 619 to 718 in <b>Set</b> <b>2</b> and is found to occur in a number of putative <b>Set</b> <b>2</b> homologs from Schizosaccharomyces pombe to humans. Unexpectedly, BIACORE analysis reveals that the SRI domain binds specifically, and with high affinity, to CTD repeats that are doubly modified (serine 2 and serine 5 phosphorylated), indicating that <b>Set</b> <b>2</b> association across the body of genes requires a specific pattern of phosphorylated RNAPII. Deletion of the SRI domain not only abolishes <b>Set</b> <b>2</b> -RNAPII interaction but also abolishes K 36 methylation in vivo, indicating that this interaction is required for establishing K 36 methylation on chromatin. Using 6 -azauracil (6 AU) as an indicator of transcription elongation defects, we found that deletion of the SRI domain conferred a strong resistance to this compound, which was identical to that observed with <b>set</b> <b>2</b> deletion mutants. Furthermore, yeast strains carrying <b>set</b> <b>2</b> alleles that are catalytically inactive or yeast strains bearing point mutations at K 36 were also found to be resistant to 6 AU. These data suggest that it is the methylation by <b>Set</b> <b>2</b> that affects transcription elongation. In agreement with this, we have determined that deletion of <b>SET</b> <b>2,</b> its SRI domain, or amino acid substitutions at K 36 result in an alteration of RNAPII occupancy levels over transcribing genes.

40|$|Histone {{modifications}} {{are major}} determinants of DNA double-strand break (DSB) response and repair. Here we elucidate a DSB repair function for transcription-coupled <b>Set</b> <b>2</b> methylation at H 3 lysine 36 (H 3 K 36 me). Cells devoid of <b>Set</b> <b>2</b> /H 3 K 36 me are hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agents and site-specific DSBs, fail to properly activate the DNA-damage checkpoint, and show genetic interactions with DSB-sensing and repair machinery. <b>Set</b> <b>2</b> /H 3 K 36 me 3 is enriched at DSBs, {{and loss of}} <b>Set</b> <b>2</b> results in altered chromatin architecture and inappropriate resection during G 1 near break sites. Surprisingly, <b>Set</b> <b>2</b> and RNA polymerase II are programmed for destruction after DSBs in a temporal manner – resulting in H 3 K 36 me 3 to H 3 K 36 me 2 transition that {{may be linked to}} DSB repair. Finally, we show a requirement of <b>Set</b> <b>2</b> in DSB repair in transcription units – thus underscoring the importance of transcription-dependent H 3 K 36 me in DSB repair. Eukaryotic genomes are constantly subjected to exogenous and endogenous forms of DNA damage 1. Double strand breaks (DSBs) can lead to temporary loss of genetic information, and failure to repair DSBs can lead to severe genome instability and cell death. DSBs can be programmed (e. g., meiosis and immunoglobulin rearrangements) or caused by exogenou...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} prospectively {{the accuracy}} of indirect magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography for supraspinatus tendon tears during neutral positioning or abduction and external rotation (ABER) and neutral positioning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Informed consent was obtained in all patients, and the study {{was approved by the}} institutional review board. Indirect MR arthrography of the shoulder was performed in 51 symptomatic patients (14 female, 37 male; mean age, 47 years) in the neutral position (set 1) and in the neutral and ABER positions (<b>set</b> <b>2).</b> Two readers independently interpreted both sets, and diagnoses were compared with arthroscopic findings. Diagnostic accuracy was calculated, and 95 % confidence intervals were used to detect significant differences between sets. Diagnostic confidence was recorded by using a three-level confidence score. Differences between sets were evaluated by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Interobserver agreement was determined separately for each set and for all diagnoses, full-thickness tears, and partial-thickness tears. RESULTS: For full-thickness tears, there was no benefit to reading <b>set</b> <b>2.</b> For reader 1, sensitivity and specificity were 95 % and 100 %, respectively, for set 1 and 100 % and 100 %, respectively, for <b>set</b> <b>2.</b> For reader 2, sensitivity and specificity were 80 % and 100 %, respectively, for set 1 and 100 % and 100 %, respectively, for <b>set</b> <b>2.</b> For partial-thickness tears, sensitivity was significantly higher after reading <b>set</b> <b>2.</b> For reader 1, sensitivity and specificity were 71 % and 88 %, respectively, for set 1 and 93 % and 100 %, respectively, for <b>set</b> <b>2.</b> For reader 2, sensitivity and specificity were 50 % and 88 %, respectively, for set 1 and 86 % and 94 %, respectively, for <b>set</b> <b>2.</b> For both readers, diagnostic confidence for partial-thickness tears was significantly higher after reading <b>set</b> <b>2.</b> After the interpretation of <b>set</b> <b>2,</b> kappa values increased from 0. 35 to 1. 00 for full-thickness tears and from 0. 12 to 0. 63 for partial-thickness tears. CONCLUSION: Indirect MR arthrography with supplementary images obtained with patients in the ABER position significantly improved sensitivity and increased diagnostic confidence for partial-thickness tears of the supraspinatus tendon. Interobserver agreement was improved for both full- and partial-thickness tears...|$|R
