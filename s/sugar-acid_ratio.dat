40|$|ABSTRACT The flavor {{quality of}} citrus fruits is largely {{determined}} by the <b>sugar-acid</b> <b>ratio,</b> but it remains uncertain how sugar- and/or acid-metabolizing enzymes regulate the <b>sugar-acid</b> <b>ratio</b> of navel oranges and further affect the fruit quality. In the present study, Robertson navel oranges (Citrus sinesis Osb.) were collected from six representative habitats in three eco-regions of Sichuan, China. The changes in the <b>sugar-acid</b> <b>ratio</b> and the activities of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), sucrose synthase (SS), cytosolic cio-aconitase (ACO), and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) were examined in navel oranges during fruit development. The {{results indicated that the}} <b>sugar-acid</b> <b>ratio</b> of fruits in different eco-regions changed significantly from 150 days after full bloom. The SPS and cytosolic ACO fruit activities had minor changes among different ecoregions throughout the experimental periods, whereas the activities of SS and IDH changed significantly in fruits among three eco-regions. Furthermore, the <b>sugar-acid</b> <b>ratio</b> and the activities of SS in the synthetic direction and IDH were the highest in south subtropics and the lowest in north mid-subtropics, probably due to the effects of climate conditions and/or other relevant eco-factors. It demonstrated that SS in the synthetic direction and IDH were of greater importance in regulating the <b>sugar-acid</b> <b>ratio</b> of navel oranges in different eco-regions, which provided new insights into the factors that determine the flavor quality of navel oranges and valuable data for guiding relevant agricultural practices...|$|E
40|$|Strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) is one {{the most}} {{important}} fruits in the world. Its growth characteristics, yield and quality are severely affected by environmental conditions, cultivation area and cultivar. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the compatibility and yield comparison of six strawberry cultivars (‘Kordestan', ‘Parose', ‘Marak', ‘Queen', ‘Selva ' and ‘Camarosa') in a tropical area known as "Gachsaran " in Iran. This trial was arranged in a completely randomized design. Vegetative and reproductive growth parameters like the number of flowers, fruits, leaves, leaf length and width were measured. In addition, fruit qualitative and quantitative parameters such as fruit volume, yield levels, the total soluble solid (TSS), juice acidity (TA), the <b>sugar-acid</b> <b>ratio</b> (TSS/TA), juice reaction (pH), vitamin C content and fruit firmness were determined. The results of variance analysis showed that the effects of cultivars on all parameters were significant. ʻMarak ʼ cultivar had the highest number of flowers, fruits, yield level, leaf length and width, but the highest total soluble solid (TSS), <b>sugar-acid</b> <b>ratio</b> (TSS/TA), and vitamin C content were related to Queen. Total acidity (TA), fruit firmness and juice reaction (pH) were significantly high in ʻCamarosa ʼ cultivar compared with the other cultivars...|$|E
40|$|Aim was {{to compare}} effects of bee {{pollination}} and other pollination modes (wind and self-pollination) on strawberry yield and quality {{as well as the}} resulting commercial value. Data were collected on an experimental strawberry field with nine commercially important strawberry varieties in 2009 and 2010. The field was split up in 12 blocks, each contains one row of each variety. In 2009, two plants per block and variety were used for each pollination treatment. Pollination treatments were conducted by using plastic bags (slef pollination treatment), mesh bags (wind pollination treatment) or uncovered flowers (open pollination treatment). Strawberries were harvested at maturity and weight, commercial grade, firmness, colour and <b>sugar-acid</b> <b>ratio</b> assessed...|$|E
40|$|Tomato is {{sensitive}} to ozone. Fruit growth and composition is altered under ozone stress by modification of reproductive development.. Fifty-one-day-old plants were exposed to three concentrations of ozone (200, 350 and 500 [*]µg[*]m(- 3)) for four hours. Ozone reduced well-developed fruit number and fruit size, {{but it did not}} significantly affect flowering rate and fruit setting rate. The effect of ozone depends on organ developmental stage at the time of ozone application, as flowers and young fruits at the time of ozone exposure were more affected. Contents of total soluble sugars (Total SS), total organic acids (Total OA) and ascorbic acid (AsA) increased in fruits harvested from ozone-treated plants. Tomato fruit composition was altered under ozone stress, leading to a lower <b>sugar-acid</b> <b>ratio.</b> These changes were mostly due to increased contents of malic acid, ascorbate, and glucose despite a decrease in sucrose. Acute ozone exposure up to 500 [*]µg[*]m(- 3) greatly influences tomato fruit quality. As final fruit yield was not significantly reduced, it highlighted that there may be compensatory mechanisms present in the reproductive structures of tomato. Further research would be necessary to determine how reproductive traits are affected by repeated ozone exposure or longer term exposur...|$|E
40|$|Background: In recent years, a new everbearing {{strawberry}} cultivar, ‘Summertiara’ was cultivated {{to supply}} the strawberries in pre-harvest season from July to October in Japan. For highly {{research and development of}} processing of this cultivar, ‘Summertiara’ berries, the objective {{of this study was to}} characterize these berries, with relation to chemical parameters, total phenols, total flavonoids, total vitamin C, and total anthocyanins, and was to investigate the solubility and the stability of anthocyanins from the berries. Moreover, the functional properties such as antioxidative activity, active oxygen species scavenging activity, and antihypertensive activity were also evaluated. Methods: Chemical analysis, colour measurement, and sensory evaluation of new everbearing strawberry cultivar, ‘Summertiara’ berries were performed. Next, the solubility of anthocyanins from the berries and stability of these against pH, temperature, and an incandescent lighting were investigated. Moreover, functional properties of the extracts prepared from berries were elucidated using 5 different methods. Results: The contents of water, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and ash were the same as those of other cultivar berries. The <b>sugar-acid</b> <b>ratio</b> in the berries was low; these were acidulous. By sensory evaluation, the main factors were vivid red colour, aroma, and acidity. The berries were rich in phenols, flavonoids, vitamin C, and anthocyanins. The anthocyanins of the berries Functional Foods in Health and Disease 2014; 4 (1) : 1 - 22 Page 2 of 22 became unstable by heat treatment and light exposures such as visible rays. On the other hand, the extracts prepared from the berries showed the functionalities such as antioxidant activity, active oxygen species scavenging activities, and antihypertensive activity.

40|$|Saline water {{resources}} are {{abundant in the}} coastal areas of south China. Most of these resources still have not been effectively utilized. A 3 -year study {{on the effects of}} saline water irrigation on tomato yield, quality and blossom-end rot (BER) was conducted at different lower limits of soil matric potential (- 10 kPa, - 20 kPa, - 30 kPa, - 40 kPa and - 50 kPa). Saline water differing in electrical conductivity (EC) (3 dS/m, 4 dS/m, 4. 5 dS/m, 5 dS/m and 5. 5 dS/m) was supplied to the plant after the seedling establishment. In all three years, irrigation water with 5. 5 dS/m salinity reduced the maximum leaf area index (LAIm) and chlorophyll content the most significantly when compared with other salinity treatments. However, compared with the control treatment (CK), a slight increase in LAIm and chlorophyll content was observed with 3 ~ 4 dS/m salinity. Saline water improved tomato quality, including fruit density, soluble solid, total acid, vitamin C and the <b>sugar-acid</b> <b>ratio.</b> There was a positive relationship between the overall tomato quality and salinity of irrigation water, as analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA). The tomato yield decreased with increased salinity. The 5. 5 dS/m treatment reduced the tomato yield (Yt) by 22. 4 ~ 31. 1 %, 12. 6 ~ 28. 0 % and 11. 7 ~ 27. 3 %, respectively in 2012, 2013 and 2014, compared with CK. Moreover, a significant (P≤ 0. 01) coupling effect of salinity and soil matric potential on Yt was detected. Saline water caused Yt to increase more markedly when the lower limit of soil matric potential was controlled at a relatively lower level. The critical salinity level that produced significant increases in the BERi was 3 dS/m~ 4 dS/m. Following the increase in BERi under saline water irrigation, marketable tomato yield (Ym) decreased by 8. 9 %~ 33. 8 % in 2012, 5. 1 %~ 30. 4 % in 2013 and 10. 1 %~ 32. 3 % in 2014 compared with CK. In terms of maintaining the Yt and Ym, the salinity of irrigation water should be controlled under 4 dS/m, and the lower limit of soil matric potential should be greater than - 20 kPa...|$|E
40|$|Wentan(Citrus grandis Osbeck) is a {{cultivar}} of pummelo grown intropical and subtropical climates. Its {{flesh is}} tender and juicywith good sugar-acid flavor. The production of Wentan pummelogreatly increases year by year. However, due to not having a goodgrading standards for its quality, consumers have difficulty tochoose which is good. The quality competition for Wentan pummelo iscarried out every year by government for promotion, but there arelack of definite standards for judging. Therefore, it is importantto establish the quality standards of Wentan pummelo. The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate thephysico-chemical properties and degree of preference of Wentanpummelo harvested in Tair-Nan, Nan-Tour, Hwa-Lian and Miau-Lihprefectures in Taiwan and to establish the quality standards for it. The physicochemical items included Hunter L,a,b values and thicknessof peel, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, sugar-acid ratioand juice content of flesh, and quantitative analysis of varioussugars and organic acids in juice. The sensory attributes forconsumer tests included the peel appearance, sweetness, sourness,bitterness, flavor, smoothness, juiciness of flesh and overallpreference. The results of this study show that the sugars in Wentan pummelowere sucrose, fructose and glucose and the major organic acids werecitric acid, tartaric acid, malic acid and ascorbic acid. Duringstorage, total soluble solids and titratable acidity increased withthe fructose, glucose and citric acid increased, while the changesin <b>sugar-acid</b> <b>ratio</b> was not significant during six weeks storage. Atthe beginning of harvesting time Wentan pummelo had low erpreference scores in sweetness, sourness, flavor, smoothness andjuciness. After being stored, it had better quality and the qualitycould be keep up for storing from one to four weeks at 27 ℃. Afterbeing stored for five weeks at 27 ℃, the quality of Wentan pummelogradually decreased. The total soluble solids, titratable acidity, sugar-acid ratioand juice content of Wentan pummelo significantly correlated withthe degrees of preference in sweetness, sourness, flavor andJuiciness by consumer test. Based on the consumer sensory results,the fruits to be qualified as "good'' grade must have the peelthickness less than 6 mm, the total soluble solids higher than 11 oBrix, the titratable acidity below 0. 40 %, the sugar-acid ratioabove 25 and the juice content above 45 %. 文旦 (Citrus grandis Osbeck) 為柚類中的一個品種，主要生產於 熱帶及亞熱帶地區。 其果實柔軟多汁，酸甜適中，且具特殊風味，但由 於品質不齊，常受消費者所垢病。 文旦產量逐年提高，近幾年來有生產 過剩的現象，政府為了提昇文旦品質， 每年均舉辦文旦果品競賽，但評 鑑標準不一，無法適當鑑定出文旦品質，因此建立一個客觀可行之品質鑑 定標準成為當務之課題。 本研究是以本省文旦主要產區台南縣、 南 投縣、花蓮縣及苗栗縣之文旦果園，所採收與貯藏的文旦為研究對象， 進行果皮 Hunter L,a,b 值、厚度與果肉的可溶性固形物、 滴定酸度、 糖酸比、 榨汁率及使用高效率液相層析儀 (HPLC) 定量分析果汁中的醣 類與有機酸，並配合消費者對其果皮外觀色澤、果肉之甜味、酸味、苦味 、風味、細緻感、多汁感及整體等項目之喜好性， 探討文旦於貯藏過程 品質之變化及建立文旦品質鑑定標準。 結果顯示文旦果肉中糖類有蔗 糖、果糖及葡萄糖， 有機酸主要為檸檬酸、酒石酸、蘋果酸及抗壞血酸 。 貯藏期間可溶性固形物及滴定酸度有逐漸增加的趨勢， 主要是因果糖 、葡萄糖及檸檬酸含量提高之故，糖酸比在六週貯藏過程無顯著差異。 新鮮文旦的甜味、酸味、風味、細緻感、多汁感均較差，經過貯藏後品質 較佳， 在 27 ℃下貯藏一∼四週期間文旦品質維持穩定，貯藏至五週後 品質又逐漸降低。 文旦中可溶性固形物、 滴定酸度、糖酸比及榨汁 率與消費者的甜味、酸味、風味及多汁感喜好程度有顯著相關。 根據本 研究消費者品評結果，高品質文旦的條件為果皮厚度在 6 mm 以下，可溶 性固形物於 11 oBrix 以上， 滴定酸度低於 0. 40 %，糖酸比高於 25 ，果 汁率在 45 % 以上...|$|E
40|$|Meteorological {{conditions}} are important environmental factors affecting apple quality. To understand the possible impact {{of climate change}} on the apple quality of the major producing areas in China and assess the quality of major apple species (e. g., Fuji, Ralls, and Golden Delicious), we studied the variation trends and abrupt change characteristics of six major climate factors affecting seven physicochemical indices of apple quality across five apple regions, including the Loess Plateau, Bohai Bay, the Old Course of the Yellow River, Southwest Highlands, and Xinjiang, using statistical methods, meteorological indices, and the ArcGIS analysis tool based on the meteorological observational data from 1961 to 2013. The {{results show that the}} spatial and temporal distributions of annual average temperature, annual sunshine duration, average summer temperature, summer diurnal temperature range, and average summer relative humidity all significantly changed (except annual precipitation) and that abrupt changes occurred. The annual temperatures and average summer temperatures in the Loess Plateau apple region and the Liaoning producing region of Bohai Bay increased within optimal ranges. In addition, for high-value regions, the hours of sunshine decreased, helping to improve the fruit shape index, <b>sugar-acid</b> <b>ratio,</b> and vitamin C (VC) content. Relatively high temperatures continued to increase to high values which remained lower than the optimal upper limit; the diurnal temperature range continued to decrease; and the sunshine hours significantly decreased within the optimal range, which might have worsened fruit hardness, soluble sugar, and peel anthocyanin in the producing regions of Southwest Shandong of Bohai Bay, Southeast Hebei of the Old Course of the Yellow River, Northern Anhui, and Jiangsu. In the production regions of the Yun-Gui plateau in the Southwest highlands, increased summer temperature and the diurnal temperature range were both within the optimal ranges, which might have helped to reduce fruit hardness and increase soluble sugar content. However, continuously increased temperature and reduced sunshine might have worsened the apple shape index and fruit coloring. In the Xinjiang apple-producing region, the climate became warmer and more humid with reduced daily sunshine hours, which might have improved the exterior quality of apples and reduced fruit hardness. Thus, the climate changes over the last 50 years have positively affected the seven apple quality physicochemical properties in the Loess Plateau and Xinjiang, whereas the impacts on the different indices of apple quality in the other apple-producing regions are less coherent. In general, climate change has significantly affected the apple quality of the major production regions in China. Corresponding scientific measures are needed to assure high apple quality to increase the income of farmers in the future...|$|E
