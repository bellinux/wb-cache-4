5|$|It was {{recognized}} that fighter escort was inherently desirable, {{but no one}} could quite conceive how a small fighter could have the range of the bomber yet retain its combat maneuverability.

5|$|To {{these rules}} we must add a further one for closed loops that implies an {{integration}} on momenta , since these internal ("virtual") particles are not constrained to any specific energy–momentum – even that usually required by special relativity (<b>see</b> <b>this</b> article for details).|$|E

5|$|Although {{many species}} have been named, modern paleontologists {{recognize}} only one, T. bataar, as valid. Some experts <b>see</b> <b>this</b> species as an Asian representative of the North American genus Tyrannosaurus; this would make the genus Tarbosaurus redundant. Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, if not synonymous, {{are considered to be}} at least closely related genera. Alioramus, also from Mongolia, is thought by some authorities to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by Protestant supporters, {{including}} several in the Cathedral chapter, he declared he would retain the electorate, and in December 1582, he formally announced his conversion to the reformed {{faith and the}} parity of Calvinism with Catholicism in the Electorate and archdiocese of Cologne. The marriage with Agnes was celebrated on 4February 1583, and afterward Gebhard remained in possession of the <b>see.</b> <b>This</b> affair created a stir in the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E

5|$|From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a {{great deal}} of his time and fortune on a series of {{projects}} trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He could <b>see</b> <b>this</b> as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{ordered an}} inquest into the {{revenues}} and resources of his bishopric, {{along with the}} customs of the <b>see.</b> <b>This</b> took place in 1183, {{and when it was}} finished, the results were entered into a register that became known as the Boldon Book. Hugh also fought a long-running disagreement with his own cathedral chapter over the right to oversee the monks, a conflict that lasted about 40 years. This led to the monks forging many documents purporting to show that earlier bishops had granted the monks rights and privileges exempting them from episcopal oversight. He also fought with Archbishop Roger of York over lands they both held in each other's see.|$|E
5|$|Next was {{the main}} event, which saw John Cena defend the WWE Championship against The Great Khali. Khali {{attacked}} Cena early in the match, but Cena countered and gained the advantage. Cena performed a diving legdrop bulldog and followed by putting Khali in the STFU. Cena forced Khali {{to submit to the}} hold, but Khali's foot was under the rope, meaning Cena should have broken the hold. The referee, however, did not <b>see</b> <b>this</b> and declared Cena the winner. Cena retained the WWE Championship and gained possession of the belt, which Khali had kayfabe stolen prior to the event.|$|E

5|$|Peter, Joe and Quagmire drag Cleveland {{to a bar}} {{to get him to}} {{meet some}} women, as he's still reeling from him and Loretta getting a divorce. It doesn’t work so well, so when The Bachelorette comes to Quahog, Peter takes Cleveland to {{audition}} for the show. Cleveland gets nervous at the audition and in an effort to calm him, Peter removes Cleveland’s clothes and then his own. The producers <b>see</b> <b>this</b> and Brian apologizes for what happened with Peter and Cleveland--Brian begins to explain how Cleveland and his wife recently divorced and how Cleveland's confused about what he really wants in a relationship.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opinion in}} Texas was divided. Editorials in the United States began advocating {{complete}} independence for Texas. After several men staged a minor revolt against customs duties in Anahuac in June, local leaders began {{calling for a}} public meeting {{to determine whether a}} majority of settlers favored independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would <b>see</b> <b>this</b> type of gathering as a step towards revolution, by the end of August most communities had agreed to send delegates to the Consultation, scheduled for October 15.|$|E

5|$|Public {{opinion was}} sharply divided. Some {{communities}} supported the rebellion {{for a variety}} of reasons. Others, including Gonzales, declared their loyalty to Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna's centralist government. Local leaders began calling for a Consultation to determine whether a majority of settlers favored independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would <b>see</b> <b>this</b> type of gathering as a step toward revolution, by the end of August most communities had agreed to send delegates to the Consultation, scheduled for October 15. In the interim, many communities formed militias to protect themselves from a potential attack by military forces.|$|E
5|$|The main {{mechanisms}} {{to create the}} resemblances described by Poulton – whether in nature or in military applications – are crypsis, blending into the background so as to become hard to <b>see</b> (<b>this</b> covers both special and general resemblance); disruptive patterning, using colour and pattern {{to break up the}} animal's outline, which relates mainly to general resemblance; mimesis, resembling other objects of no special interest to the observer, which relates to special resemblance; countershading, using graded colour to create the illusion of flatness, which relates mainly to general resemblance; and counterillumination, producing light to match the background, notably in some species of squid.|$|E
5|$|The {{strong force}} only acts {{directly}} upon elementary particles. However, a residual {{of the force}} is observed between hadrons (the best known example being the force that acts between nucleons in atomic nuclei) as the nuclear force. Here the strong force acts indirectly, transmitted as gluons, which form part of the virtual pi and rho mesons, which classically transmit the nuclear force (<b>see</b> <b>this</b> topic for more). The failure of many searches for free quarks {{has shown that the}} elementary particles affected are not directly observable. This phenomenon is called color confinement.|$|E

5|$|While Philip {{was walking}} through Abydos, he saw people killing {{themselves}} and their families by stabbing, burning, hanging, and jumping down wells and from rooftops. Philip was surprised to <b>see</b> <b>this,</b> and published a proclamation announcing that would give three day's grace to anybody wishing to commit suicide. The Abydenians, who were bent on following the orders of the original decree, thought that this would amount to treason to the people who had already died, and refused to live under these terms. Apart from those in chains or similar restraints, each family individually hurried to their deaths.|$|E
5|$|Windsor Park is {{the largest}} Association {{football}} stadium in Northern Ireland, with Glentoran's ground, the Oval, being the next largest. The governing body of Northern Irish football, the Irish Football Association, leases the ground {{for use by the}} Northern Ireland national football team. The club currently receives 15% of Northern Ireland international gate receipts as rent. This is controversial as rival Irish League clubs <b>see</b> <b>this</b> as giving Linfield an unfair advantage by allowing them to offer more attractive wages and have a larger squad than all of the other clubs. In 2010, UEFA provided €500,000 towards substantial refurbishment of the stadium, to increase capacity and improve safety.|$|E
5|$|After {{the train}} is {{dispatched}} and enters Wonder Mountain, riders {{find themselves in a}} graveyard where zombies are roaming. At the end of the scene, riders who began facing forward see a survivor directing them to the next scene. Riders who were seated backwards do not <b>see</b> <b>this</b> transition. The next scene takes place in a house overrun by the zombies and large spiders. At the end of the scene a truck crashes into the house. Riders then leave the house and pass the survivor; this transition is again absent for backward-seated riders. The train continues to a road with zombies, where three cars with zombies on them join the riders. Two of the cars crash {{at the end of the}} scene. The train then passes through a tunnel with abandoned cars; this scene is absent for riders facing backward. Riders then battle the zombies for the final time before entering the drop track sequence. The names of the highest-scoring riders are displayed on a leader-board for this version of the attraction.|$|E
