25|$|The pulsar's extreme {{energy output}} creates an unusually dynamic region at {{the centre of}} the Crab Nebula. While most astronomical objects evolve so slowly that changes are visible only over {{timescales}} of many years, the inner parts of the Crab Nebula show changes over timescales of only a few days. The most dynamic feature in the inner part of the nebula is the point where the pulsar's equatorial wind <b>slams</b> <b>into</b> the bulk of the nebula, forming a shock front. The shape and position of this feature shifts rapidly, with the equatorial wind appearing as a series of wisp-like features that steepen, brighten, then fade as they move away from the pulsar to well out into {{the main body of the}} nebula.|$|E
25|$|When they arrive, {{they find}} a trail of dead rabbits is found leading to the camp, ending with Brindleface {{in front of the}} camp, who had been killed by Tigerstar. Fireheart orders a patrol {{to get rid of the}} rabbits. Brindleface's death shocks everyone, and after her burial, the camp is {{evacuated}} to Sunningrocks to protect ThunderClan. With Bluestar still mentally unstable, it is up to Fireheart to destroy the pack and protect ThunderClan. He and the senior warriors decide that a patrol of cats will lead the dogs to and over the nearby gorge, drowning the dogs. But, before he leaves, he apologizes to Sandstorm for not obeying Bluestar and they fall in love, but all they did was realize the existing love they had for each other. The plan works: each cat successfully leads the pack closer to the gorge, breaking away from the group once they lead the dogs to a certain spot, where a fresh runner lies in wait so they can lead the dogs to the next point. Fernpaw and Ashpaw, Brindleface's kits, took part in leading the dogs; they did it as revenge against Tigerstar for killing their mother. Fireheart, the last in line, keeps a good distance between him and the pack leader, until Tigerstar appears and pins Fireheart down. As the dog leader gets dangerously close, Tigerstar leaps away, leaving Fireheart to be killed by the pack. As Fireheart struggles against the dog, Bluestar, her old self returned once more, <b>slams</b> <b>into</b> the dog, releasing its grip on Fireheart and throwing the dog —and herself— over the side of the gorge.|$|E

Brindleface's death shocks everyone, and after her burial, the Clan is evacuated from their camp to Sunningrocks. Fireheart and the senior warriors decide that a patrol of cats will attempt to lead the dogs over the edge of a nearby gorge, drowning the dogs. The plan works: each cat successfully leads the pack closer to the gorge. Fireheart, the last in line, keeps a good distance between him and the pack leader, until Tigerstar appears and pins Fireheart down. As the dog leader gets dangerously close, Tigerstar leaps away, leaving Fireheart to be killed by the pack.
