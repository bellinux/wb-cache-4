25|$|Poincaré {{was born}} on 29 April 1854 in Cité Ducale neighborhood, Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle into an {{influential}} family. His father Leon Poincaré (1828–1892) was {{a professor of medicine}} at the University of Nancy. His adored younger sister Aline married the spiritual philosopher Emile Boutroux. Another notable member of Henri's family was his cousin, Raymond Poincaré, who would serve as President of France from 1913 to 1920, and who was a fellow member of the Académie française. He was raised in the Roman Catholic faith, but later left the religion. He became a freethinker, believing in the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>truth</b> and was said to be an atheist.|$|E

25|$|Repin {{persistently}} {{searched for}} new techniques and content {{to give his}} work more fullness and depth. Repin had a set of favorite subjects, and a limited circle of people whose portraits he painted. But he had {{a deep sense of}} purpose in his aesthetics, and had the great artistic gift to sense the spirit of the age and its reflection in the lives and characters of individuals. Repin's <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>truth</b> and for an ideal led him in various directions artistically, influenced by hidden aspects of social and spiritual experiences as well as national culture. Like most Russian realists of his times, Repin often based his works on dramatic conflicts, drawn from contemporary life or history. He also used mythological images with a strong sense of purpose; some of his religious paintings are among his greatest.|$|E
25|$|The Unitarian {{belief that}} reason, and not creed, defines the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>truth,</b> and the Universalist belief that God embraces all people equally {{has led to}} the current Unitarian Universalist belief that truth and spiritual meaning can be found in all faiths. This is {{reflected}} in the wide-array of spiritual practices found among UUs today. Many Unitarian Universalist congregations include Buddhist-style meditation groups, Jewish Seder, Yom Kippur and Passover dinners, iftaar meals (marking the breaking of Ramadan fast for Muslims), and Christmas Eve/Winter Solstice services. Children's and youth's religious education classes teach about the divinity {{of the world and the}} sanctity of world religions. One of its more popular curricula, Neighboring Faiths (formerly Church Across the Street), takes middle and high school participants to visit the places of worship of many faith traditions including a Hindu temple, a Reform or Orthodox synagogue, and a Catholic church.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} pedagogy {{of moderate}} expressivism {{is characterized by}} a focus on language as a tool for personal rather than social expression, based on the process theory of composition, a belief that the process of writing should be more important than the final product. Further, moderate expressivist pedagogy calls for less grammatical standards and an increased focus on the writer’s process of discovery and expression. W.E. Coles, Jr. suggests that teaching writing should be approached as teaching art, with the teacher serving as facilitator or guide for the student-writer’s free expression; he also calls for classroom practices such as peer-reviews, class discussions, and the absence of grades, in order to best guide the self-identification he sees as crucial to the writing process. Fellow moderate expressivist Donald Murray maintains that writing is a process of discovery and experimentation, a <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>truth</b> in a specious world; his manifesto-like essay provides an apt summation of the arguments against the dated pedagogy of CTR. Likewise, Maxine Hairston recognizes the paradigm shift occurring in rhetoric and composition and calls for a non-prescriptive atmosphere in teaching, including less focus on grammar and syntax and, again, more concern with the process of growth experienced by the writer. Peter Elbow reflects moderate expressivist ideals in his claim that audience should be ignored during {{the early stages of the}} writing process, in order to avoid the hindrance of audience expectation and facilitate writer-based rather than reader-based text. Elbow writes, “It’s not that writers should never think about their audience. It’s a question of when.” Simply put, moderate expressivism promotes the notion of process over product, a pedagogy that evolved in the height of the 1960s and in many ways reflects the ideologies of the era in its emphasis on freedom, expression, discovery, and a search for the writer’s authentic self.|$|E

Through the remainder of the 19th century, there were few historical evaluations of Johnson and his presidency. Memoirs from Northerners who had dealt with him, such as former vice president Henry Wilson and Maine Senator James G. Blaine, depicted him as an obstinate boor who tried to favor the South in Reconstruction, but who was frustrated by Congress. According to historian Howard K. Beale in his journal article about the historiography of Reconstruction, [...] "Men of the postwar decades were more concerned with justifying their own position than they were with painstaking <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>truth.</b> Thus [...] Hilary Herbert and his corroborators presented a Southern indictment of Northern policies, and Henry Wilson's history was a brief for the North." ...|$|E

500|$|Quantico was {{designed}} with over a half-dozen core characters, {{in addition to}} Alex Parrish, for pacing reasons. It was intended to have a flashback narrative, shifting between [...] "the present day with Parrish navigating her way through a class of FBI New Agent Trainees to the near future as the truth and repercussions of the attack emerge". Safran also used flashforwards to spread out the series' plot points. He said in a 2015 interview that although the series is [...] "intricately plotted", it {{does not intend to}} overwhelm the viewer, saying: [...] "It is tightly structured and moves quickly between two, sometimes three, time periods, but we made sure that it's not so complicated that it just feels like too much. I like to say that {{we have a lot of}} tributaries, but they all lead to one ocean". The series' diverse cast has helped its writers create a variety of storylines and plot points. According to a Variety article on Safran and Quantico, [...] "The show delves below the surface into those disparate backgrounds to explore how each character’s personal stories influence their motivations for joining the FBI and in their perspective on the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>truth</b> in the terrorism investigation. That offers a wealth of engaging material for writers to mine". Safran modeled Quantico on Buffy the Vampire Slayer in structure, with self-contained story arcs from season to season. Its producers said that each season would have a specific storyline, with Alex the series' focal point surrounded by a new cast.|$|E
