500|$|Lexie was {{strongly}} criticized by Laura Burrows from IGN, being called [...] "awful". Burrows also wrote: [...] "Everything <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>and</b> does is obnoxious and does harm to someone. Lexie is an idiot {{and should be}} shot or drowned or exploded." [...] The character's relationship with Sloan has been well received, with Chris Monfette of IGN writing: [...] "Sloan's honest relationship with Lexie helped to make both characters infinitely more interesting and mature." [...] Leigh served as a primary vocalist in [...] "Song Beneath the Song", the Grey's Anatomy music event, and was well received, with the Boston Heralds Mark Perigard praising her performance. The character was listed in Wetpaint's [...] "10 Hottest Female Doctors on TV". In 2007, at the 14th Screen Actors Guild Awards, Leigh {{and the rest of}} the cast of Grey's Anatomy, received a nomination for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.|$|E
2500|$|Three-dimensional cakes, off-center cakes, cakes {{with sugar}} shards jutting from them, a {{caramelized}} sugar teeter-totter balancing equal rounds of fruit sorbet and crème fraîche. Cakes shaped like the Guggenheim Museum. Avant-garde pastry. Dessert artist Elizabeth Falkner takes these artistically inspired visions them into culinary delights. [...] "It {{is not my}} tendency to make anything round," [...] <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>and</b> her cakes are anything but. Topped with her signature explosion of sugar spirals, pulled sugar ribbons and fruit tuiles, Elizabeth Falkner’s dessert creations have become {{the talk of the}} pastry world.|$|E
2500|$|Bruner {{attracted}} {{support from}} Don McLeroy, a former SBOE member who spent twelve {{years on the}} board, the last two as chairman. McLeroy was known for sowing doubt about the theory of evolution—until he was ousted in 2010 by Thomas Ratliff. McLeroy said: [...] "I think she'll be a great asset. She testified {{all the time when}} I was on the board." [...] Regardless, McLeroy urges Bruner to be [...] "circumspect" [...] in what <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>and</b> writes. [...] "Back when I was on the board there were no tweets by Don McLeroy... There's so much more that you can find about people today than there was back then." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Neff {{learns that}} Keyes {{suspects}} Nino of being Phyllis' accomplice, Neff sees {{a way out}} of his predicament. He arranges to meet Phyllis at her house. He informs her that he knows about her involvement with Nino, and guesses that she is planning to have Nino kill him. He tells her that he intends to kill her and put the blame on Nino. She is prepared, however, and shoots him in the shoulder. Seriously wounded but still standing, he slowly comes closer and dares her to shoot again. She does not, and he takes the gun from her. She says she never loved him [...] "until a minute ago, when I couldn't fire that second shot." [...] Neff does not believe a word <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>and</b> as she hugs him tightly, Neff says, [...] "Goodbye, baby," [...] and shoots twice, killing her.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in The Guardian in 2000, Sontag was quite open about being bisexual: [...] "'Shall I tell you about getting older?', <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>and</b> she is laughing. 'When you get older, 45 plus, men stop fancying you. Or put it another way, the men I fancy don't fancy me. I want a young man. I love beauty. So what's new?' She says {{she has been in}} love seven times in her life. 'No, hang on,' she says. 'Actually, it's nine. Five women, four men.'" [...] Many of Sontag's obituaries failed to mention her significant same-sex relationships, most notably that with Annie Leibovitz. In response to this criticism, New York Times Public Editor, Daniel Okrent, defended the newspaper's obituary, stating {{that at the time of}} Sontag's death, a reporter could make no independent verification of her romantic relationship with Leibovitz (despite attempts to do so). After Sontag's death, Newsweek published an article about Annie Leibovitz that made clear references to her decade-plus relationship with Sontag.|$|E

"Well," [...] said Paul, [...] "if {{she looks}} at a man <b>she</b> <b>says</b> haughtily 'Nevermore,' <b>and</b> if {{she looks at}} herself in the looking-glass <b>she</b> <b>says</b> disdainfully 'Nevermore,' <b>and</b> if she thinks back <b>she</b> <b>says</b> it in disgust, and if she looks forward <b>she</b> <b>says</b> it cynically." ...|$|R

'But you {{see this}} unlucky girl can't {{understand}} that teaching may be a real way of doing good; she fancies it a degradation. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> her friends at her institute hated and despised the teachers, and played all manner of tricks upon them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, it is {{a pitiful}} case; and easily mended, since Fay is so eager about it. Hope the lad is all <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>and</b> nothing {{catching}} about his illness. Nanna can tell me." ...|$|E

60|$|She too {{had gained}} her wish--to see {{and speak to}} Wessex. What would <b>she</b> <b>say?</b> <b>and</b> how would he reply?

6000|$|His eyes add an {{emphasis}} to that reply {{which is not}} to be mistaken. Emily turns away from him, and notices Francine.

60|$|I am inclined, on reflection, {{to suspect}} that she is quite clever enough to have {{discovered}} that I hate her--and {{that many of the}} aggravating things <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>and</b> does are assumed, out of retaliation, for the purpose of making me angry.
