5|$|The first ship {{to reach}} Pine Island Glacier's ice <b>shelf,</b> <b>in</b> Pine Island Bay, was the USS/USCGC Glacier in 1985. This ship was an {{icebreaker}} {{operated by the}} U.S. Coast Guard. The mission, known as Deep Freeze, had scientists on board who took sediment samples from the ocean floor.|$|E
5|$|According {{to various}} organisations (the National Science Foundation, NASA, the University of California, San Diego, Russian State Museum of the Arctic and Antarctic, among others), ships captained by three men sighted Antarctica or its ice <b>shelf</b> <b>in</b> 1820: von Bellingshausen (a {{captain in the}} Imperial Russian Navy), Edward Bransfield (a captain in the Royal Navy), and Nathaniel Palmer (a sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut).|$|E
5|$|Sabah {{has seen}} several {{territorial}} disputes with Malaysia's neighbours Indonesia and the Philippines. In 2002, both Malaysia and Indonesia submitted to arbitration by the ICJ on a territorial {{dispute over the}} Ligitan and Sipadan islands which were later won by Malaysia. There are also several other disputes yet to be settled with Indonesia over the overlapping claims on the Ambalat continental <b>shelf</b> <b>in</b> the Celebes Sea and land border dispute between Sabah and North Kalimantan. Malaysia's claim over {{a portion of the}} Spratly Islands is also based on sharing a continental shelf with Sabah.|$|E

5|$|The {{range of}} the finless sleeper ray extends from the eastern Andaman Sea, near {{southern}} border between Thailand and Myanmar, through the Strait of Malacca to Singapore, and northward to Vietnam. Its exact distribution off Thailand is uncertain. There is a single record of this species from Sarawak in Borneo. This bottom-dwelling species inhabits fine sediment habitat over the continental <b>shelf</b> <b>in</b> both inshore and offshore waters. In the 19th century, it was reportedly abundant year-round in the Straits of Malacca. It is locally common in some areas.|$|E
5|$|Another unusual feature {{found in}} the abyssal and hadal zones is the cold seep, {{sometimes}} called a cold vent. This {{is an area of}} the seabed where seepage of hydrogen sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid occurs, often {{in the form of a}} deep-sea brine pool. The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983, at a depth of 3200meters in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, cold seeps have been discovered in many other areas of the World Ocean, including the Monterey Submarine Canyon just off Monterey Bay, California, the Sea of Japan, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, off the Atlantic coast of Africa, off the coast of Alaska, and under an ice <b>shelf</b> <b>in</b> Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|Decline in age, size during sexual {{maturity}} in {{great northern tilefish}} population is occurring throughout the continental <b>shelf.</b> <b>In</b> the mid-Atlantic Bight, smaller sizes and younger ages at maturity were observed in 2008, compared to the survey data from the 1980s where recorded measurements showed a larger population. The recent estimates of age and size at maturity in the southern U.S. waters were smaller than those previously reported in the late 1980s. There were also very few juvenile tilefish seen in tilefish population surveys in the southern U.S. waters in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Declines in population could negatively affect other organisms in their surrounding environment {{due to the fact}} that without tilefish, the burrows underneath the continental shelf will disappear, therefore putting an end to the symbiotic relationship with other organisms that use the tunnels as shelter.|$|E

5|$|Franck found a {{position}} at the Polytekniske LÃ¦reanstalt in Copenhagen for Arthur von Hippel, who was now his son in law, having married his daughter Dagmar. He decided to provide financial security for his children by dividing his Nobel Prize money between them. The gold medal itself was entrusted to Niels Bohr for safekeeping. When Germany invaded Denmark on 9 April 1940, the Hungarian chemist George de Hevesy dissolved the gold medal, along with that of Max von Laue in aqua regia to prevent the Germans from taking them. He placed the resulting solution on a <b>shelf</b> <b>in</b> his laboratory at the Niels Bohr Institute. After the war, he returned to find the solution undisturbed and precipitated the gold out of the acid. The Nobel Society then recast the Nobel Prize medals.|$|E
5|$|The {{adults of}} some Australian cicada {{are subject to}} a cicada-specific fungus from the genus Massospora, which grows on their {{genitalia}} and abdominal cavity, eventually causing the tail end to drop off. Australian cicadas are further preyed on by the cicada killer wasp (Exeirus lateritius), which stings and paralyses cicadas high in the trees. Their victims drop to the ground where the cicada-hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with its hind legs, sometimes over a distance of 100m (330ft). They are then shoved into the hunter's burrow, where the helpless cicada is placed on a <b>shelf</b> <b>in</b> an often extensive 'catacomb', to form food-stock for the wasp grub growing from the eggs deposited within.|$|E
