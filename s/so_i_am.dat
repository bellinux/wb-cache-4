I didn't want to go back on my word to my wife that I'd retired from front-line politics. How would it all work? Was No 10 suitable for someone in a wheelchair? All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had to ask me to join his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: why am I risking all this?

Hatch, Thurston, and Kinney, purporting to cede those Islands to the territory and dominion of the United States. I declare such a treaty to be an act of wrong toward the native and part-native people of Hawaii, an invasion of the rights of the ruling chiefs, in violation of international rights both toward my people and toward friendly nations with whom they have made treaties, the perpetuation of the fraud whereby the constitutional government was overthrown, and, finally, an act of gross injustice to me.|$|E

In genre fiction Iain Banks, writing as Iain M. Banks, produced ground-breaking science fiction.

25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E

500|$|The {{relationship}} between Maria Theresa and Joseph {{was not without}} warmth but was complicated and their personalities clashed.

500|$|Shelley {{continued}} to practice her mother's feminist principles by extending aid to women whom society disapproved of. For instance, Shelley extend {{financial aid to}} Diana Mary Dods, a single mother and illegitimate herself who {{appears to have been}} a lesbian and gave her the new identity of Isabel Robinson, the wife of a fictitious Walter Sholto Douglas. Shelley also assisted Georgiana Paul, a woman disallowed for by her husband for alleged adultery. Shelley in her diary about her assistance to the latter: [...] "I do not make a boast-I do not say aloud-behold my generosity and greatness of mind-for in truth it is simple justice I perform-and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> still reviled for being worldly".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Times of India, Karan Johar explained that he harboured intentions of remaking the original Agneepath ever since the film released in 1990. Though the film had received critical acclaim over the years, its commercial failure had devastated his father, producer Yash Johar. The idea of a possible remake materialised on the sets of Johar's directorial My Name Is Khan, in which Karan Malhotra was an assistant director. Johar told Malhotra of his desire to remake the original film {{and asked him to}} revisit it again. On not directing the film himself, Johar commented, [...] "I am happy directing films on love, romance and drama. That's what I do best. I don't think I will be good at an action film. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not taking the reins of the film in my hand".|$|E
500|$|In 1886, Sunday was {{introduced}} at Jefferson Park Presbyterian Church to Helen Amelia [...] "Nell" [...] Thompson, {{daughter of the}} owner of one of Chicago's largest dairy products businesses. Although Sunday was immediately smitten with her, both had serious on-going relationships that bordered on engagements. Furthermore, Nell Thompson had grown to maturity {{in a much more}} privileged environment than had Sunday, and her father strongly discouraged the courtship, viewing all professional baseball players as [...] "transient ne'er-do-wells who were unstable and destined to be misfits once they were too old to play." [...] Nevertheless, Sunday pursued and eventually married her. On several occasions, Sunday said, [...] "She was a Presbyterian, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a Presbyterian. Had she been a Catholic, I would have been a Catholic — because I was hot on the trail of Nell." [...] Mrs. Thompson had liked Sunday from the start and weighed in on his side, and Mr. Thompson finally relented. The couple was married on September 5, 1888.|$|E

500|$|Roddenberry {{was raised}} a Southern Baptist; however, as an adult, he {{rejected}} religion, and considered himself a humanist. He began questioning religion around {{the age of}} 14, {{and came to the}} conclusion that it was [...] "nonsense". As a child, he served in the choir at his local church, but often substituted lyrics as he sang hymns. Early in his writing career, he received an award from the American Baptist Convention for [...] "skillfully writing Christian truth and the application of Christian principles into commercial, dramatic TV scripts". For several years, he corresponded with John M. Gunn of the National Council of Churches regarding the application of Christian teachings in television series. However, Gunn stopped replying after Roddenberry wrote in a letter: [...] "But you must understand that I am a complete pagan, and consume enormous amounts of bread, having found the Word more spice than nourishment, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> interested in a statement couched in dollars and cents of what this means to the Roddenberry treasury." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{pneumatic}} value {{failure in}} the preceding race, the United States Grand Prix, had forced Häkkinen to retire from the Grand Prix. With two races of the season remaining and an eight-point deficit after losing {{the lead in the}} Drivers' Championship, Häkkinen remained confident about his title chances: [...] "I know that what happened to me in the last Grand Prix, when I had to retire, can happen to anyone, It could happen to Michael. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very optimistic. I have come here prepared and thinking about these two races together. Not one, two." [...] Michael Schumacher emphasised the pressure of leading the championship going into Japan: [...] "It hasn't been a relaxing time at all and I still haven't completely got over the jetlag from the States. But I'm prepared to sacrifice this and a lot more to bring the title back to Maranello. And {{the same can be said}} of the entire team." [...] Ferrari team principal Jean Todt and former World Champion Jody Scheckter called for Barrichello and Coulthard to race fairly as both drivers were ordered by their teams to assist their teammates in the Championship battle.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{ventured into}} orchestral music in 1991, when the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society {{commissioned}} a musical piece by him to celebrate its sesquicentennial. He collaborated with composer Carl Davis, producing Liverpool Oratorio. The performance featured opera singers Kiri Te Kanawa, Sally Burgess, Jerry Hadley and Willard White, with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir of Liverpool Cathedral. Reviews were negative. The Guardian was especially critical, describing the music as [...] "afraid of anything approaching a fast tempo", and {{adding that the}} piece has [...] "little {{awareness of the need}} for recurrent ideas that will bind the work into a whole". The paper published a letter McCartney submitted in response in which he noted several of the work's faster tempos and added, [...] "happily, history shows that many good pieces of music were not liked by the critics of the time <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> content to... let people judge for themselves the merits of the work." [...] The New York Times was slightly more generous, stating, [...] "There are moments of beauty and pleasure in this dramatic miscellany... the music's innocent sincerity makes it difficult to be put off by its ambitions". Performed around the world after its London premiere, the Liverpool Oratorio reached number one on the UK classical chart, Music Week.|$|E

500|$|Garland {{entered the}} season as one of four seniors on La Salle's men's {{basketball}} roster. Ramon Galloway, who led the team in scoring in 2012–13, graduated the previous year. Garland debuted as a senior in an exhibition game vs Indiana University of Pennsylvania on November 2, 2013, scoring 16 points on [...]500 shooting. He made his first official appearance in a double-overtime home contest against Manhattan. Garland led a 13–3 run, highlighted by two key shots, that forced overtime. He made a three-pointer with {{minutes left in the}} game, but his team ran out of time before they could rally. Nevertheless, Garland scored a career-high 28 points, hitting 12 free throws. He had an effective second game as well. Against Quinnipiac at the ESPN Tip-Off Marathon, despite scoring far fewer points, his last-minute rebound was instrumental to the Explorers' victory. Head coach John Giannini said, [...] "He had zero rebounds in 44 minutes against Manhattan. The rebound that really iced the game today was a defensive rebound by Tyrone. Sometimes you don't play well, you don't do something, and then you learn from it and do better, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> pleased with him". The guard had another notable performance on November 22, 2013, against Morgan State, when he led both teams with 25 points. He also added four three-pointers. On January 25, 2014, Garland notched a career-best 30 points vs VCU. His team's 10-point 2014 Atlantic 10 Tournament loss to St. Bonaventure, in which he contributed 0 points in 30 minutes, marked the end of his collegiate career. He finished the season averaging 12.6 points, 2.3 rebounds, 2.6 assists, and 0.7 steals. Garland, Sam Mills, Tyreek Duren, and Taylor Dunn, recorded the most wins for a single senior class at La Salle in 22 years.|$|E
500|$|Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror {{believed}} the [...] "setting and the gangsterish plot are both reminiscent of that great British movie Sexy Beast, and this first instalment of the four-part series presses {{all the right}} buttons," [...] adding [...] "it has naturalistic performances, an effortless blend of comedy and sinister undertones plus rather more shots of Marc Warren's bum cheeks than might be considered absolutely necessary." [...] Ben Walsh of The Independent rated the series three stars out of five, having written [...] "there's far too much exposition, a very daft plot, some risible dialogue and yet Sky's ripe four-parter is horribly compelling," [...] and added [...] "it's extremely silly, but Simm and Glenister are always compelling and they make this gamey tale of gangsters, police corruption and 'friendship' work." [...] Reviewing the first two episode, The Stage {{believed the}} first was [...] "a slow-burning exploration" [...] and [...] "all very intriguing and disturbing, with a great performance by Chaplin as the smilingly psychotic host." [...] The reviewer criticised the death of Alvo, as he was considered the most [...] "compelling character" [...] and since [...] "sent the plot line spinning off into less original territory," [...] adding the producers took ideas from crime capers such as Sexy Beast and Shallow Grave. The reviewer added [...] "what Mad Dogs lacks in originality it makes up for in energy, verve and humour. The dialogue positively crackles with great lines." [...] In the end, the reviewer stated that Mad Dogs [...] "may be an unapologetic crowd pleaser, {{but it is a}} finely made one, with excellent performances from a dream cast. It also offers the only opportunity I have of seeing blue skies, azure waters and sunshine in February, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in for the duration." ...|$|E
500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You have your own ideas. We do not want that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I suppose you were made so!... Had you chosen a name which we could approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sorry but you make your own difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as well as your own. Perhaps in time you will learn the lessons that we all have to learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become a worry for Pankhurst as well. She decided that Adela should move to Australia, and paid for her relocation. They never saw one another again.|$|E
