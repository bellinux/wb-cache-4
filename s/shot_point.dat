In Australia, the sport attracted criticism when a 39-year-old man playing at a registered field in Victoria died of a suspected heart attack, after being struck in the chest.|$|E
500|$|Between Marquette and Munising, M-28 closely {{parallels}} the Lake Superior shoreline, providing scenic {{views of the}} lake and its [...] "lonesome sandy beaches". The Lakenenland Sculpture Park is located in Chocolay Township near <b>Shot</b> <b>Point</b> in eastern Marquette County. This roadside attraction is owned by Tom Lakenen and features fanciful works of art made of scrap iron. Near the community of Au Train, M-28 crosses into the western unit of the Hiawatha National Forest. West of Munising is a ferry dock offering transport to the Grand Island National Recreation Area, and at Munising there is easy access to Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. The roadway also features variable message signs to warn motorists of winter weather-related traffic closures along the lakeshore. Installed at the US41 and M-94 junctions, the signs advise motorists which sections of roadway are closed. Per MDOT policy, only snowplows are allowed on these sections during a closure. The highway exits the Hiawatha National Forest at the Alger County–Schoolcraft County line along the Seney Stretch.|$|E

Points to win, winning margin, {{definition}} of a point (partially or fully through the slot), regular <b>shot</b> <b>points,</b> corner <b>shot</b> <b>points,</b> diamond <b>shot</b> <b>points</b> etc.., are usually agreed upon by the players prior to a match.

50|$|On {{the night}} of December 4 Powell and {{companion}} Archibald Macdonald left {{the central part of}} town to investigate the reports of rebel activities to the north. Unbeknownst to them the rebels had captured a local armoury and were based at Montgomery's Tavern, preparing to march south.

He killed one of his captors, Captain Anthony Anderson, and made good his escape. He <b>shot</b> <b>point</b> blank at Mackenzie but the pistol misfired and the rebel leader was unharmed.

50|$|The Aguas Blancas Massacre was a {{massacre}} {{that took place}} on 28 June 1995, in Aguas Blancas, Guerrero, Mexico, in which, according to the official version, 17 farmers were killed and 21 injured. Members of the Organización Campesina de la Sierra Sur (South Mountain Range Farmer Organization) were en route to Atoyac de Álvarez to attend a protest march demanding the release of Gilberto Romero Vázquez, a peasant activist arrested {{more than a month}} before (and who has never appeared since). They were also marching to demand drinking water, schools, hospitals and roads, among other things. According to survivors, they were ambushed by the motorized police and several were <b>shot</b> <b>point</b> blank. Some of the events were captured on film, by the police themselves. Weapons were subsequently placed in the dead farmers' hands and the police said they acted in self-defense.|$|E
5000|$|At Treblinka, Miete {{gained a}} notorious {{reputation}} for his cruelty. He was nicknamed the [...] "Angel of Death" [...] by the prisoners. Miete {{was in charge}} of the fake infirmary known as Lazaret, a small barracks surrounded by the barbed wire fence where the sick, elderly and difficult prisoners were taken away from view directly from newly arrived transports. The children of sick women and children who arrived alone on the transports were sent with them. They were <b>shot</b> <b>point</b> blank at the edge of a burial ditch seven metres deep. Miete carried out most of these killings with his own hand, aided by his subordinate Willi Mentz nicknamed [...] "Frankenstein" [...] by the inmates, who alone killed thousands, as well as Max Möller, the [...] "Amerikaner". Dressed as medic, Miete [...] "cured each one with a single pill".|$|E
50|$|Barge mounted test detonations was a {{technique}} first used in 1954, and also {{compensated for the}} lack of land at the HP. When testing returned to Bikini atoll the use of barges as the <b>shot</b> <b>point</b> had begun, with one notable advantage, no radioactive surface zero areas ware developed. Two large underwater craters were formed in 1954 and these were used as subsequent surface zeros for detonations fired from barges. This allowed the available land area to be used for the placement of measurement instrumentation and reuse of the same burst point without the long delays required for radiological cooling by natural decay or expensive and long decontamination procedures. Reuse of zero points also allowed reuse of instrument locations and recording shelters for several tests saving construction costs and time and Increasing test-scheduling flexibility. In HARDTACK the 26 barge events used only five detonation areas.|$|E

30|$|We have {{compared}} the mean values of velocity changes. To see the spatial variations of velocity changes, {{we need to}} consider sensitivity kernels (e.g., Pacheco and Snieder 2005). The kernels have two peaks at the position of the source and station (see Additional file 2). Therefore, measured velocity changes are expected to be sensitive to local changes at the source and station. Coda waves that we use are probably the mixture of body waves and surface waves. One advantage of our study is that both of <b>shot</b> <b>points</b> and stations are located at near surface. Therefore, the sensitivity kernels have large sensitivities near the surface regardless of the predominance of either body waves or surface waves. Almost annual changes in seismic velocity are detected commonly for many shot–station pairs and station pairs. This suggests that the almost annual changes in seismic velocity take place at shallow depths widely over Sakurajima. On the other hand, {{it is true that the}} spatial variation of the estimated relative velocity change exists, especially in the shorter-period component. So far, causes of such spatial variation are not clear yet, though it may reflect structural changes in the vicinity of <b>shot</b> <b>points</b> or stations.|$|R
40|$|Seismic {{exploration}} using artificial sources {{was conducted}} at Kuchierabujima volcano, southwest Japan in November 2004 by 40 participants from 9 national universities andJapan Meteorological Agency to investigate the subsurface seismic structure. The exploration was the 11 th joint experiment under the National Project for Prediction of Volcanic Eruptions. A total of 183 temporal stations equippedwith a 2 Hz vertical component seismometer (including 75 3 component seismometers) and a portable data logger were deployed on Kuchierabu Island. Dynamite shots with charges of 10 - 115 kg were detonated at 19 locations, and seismic signals were successfully recorded. To reveal the P-wave velocity structure, 2955 arrival times of the first motion were picked from the seismograms, and 2187 were classified into ranks A and B. From the record sections and the arrival time data, characteristics reflecting the geological structure were identified. Refracted waves of 5 km/s were observed at stations＞ 5 km from the <b>shot</b> <b>points.</b> Apparent velocities near the <b>shot</b> <b>points</b> depend on the surface geology around the shots. P-wave arrived earlier at stations near the summits. Strongly scattered waves were observed similarly near the summits...|$|R
