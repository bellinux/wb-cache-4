25|$|She {{was born}} Florence Elizabeth Chandler in Mobile, Alabama, the {{daughter}} of William George Chandler, {{a partner in the}} banking firm of St. John Powers and Company, and at one time mayor of Mobile. Her father died, and her mother Caroline Chandler Du Barry, née Holbrook, remarried a third time in 1872 to Baron Adolph von Roques, a cavalry officer in the Eighth Cuirassier Regiment of the German Army. While travelling to Britain with her mother, she met cotton broker James Maybrick on board ship. Other passengers were either amused or shocked by a 19-year-old girl <b>spending</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> alone in the company of Maybrick, who was 23 years her senior. On 27 July 1881, they were married at St James's Church, Piccadilly, in London. They settled in Battlecrease House, Aigburth, a suburb of Liverpool.|$|E
25|$|Zaripa {{decides that}} {{it is best to}} {{forestall}} conveying the news of Abutalip's death to her children. Yedigei thereafter becomes the paternal figure in her children's lives and grows to love them more than his own daughters. Abutalip's last request was for Yedigei to tell his sons about the Aral Sea, so Yedigei spends much time telling them about his former occupation as a fisherman. As a result of his frequent reminiscing, Yedigei recalls the time he had to catch a golden sturgeon to quell the desires of his wife, Ukubala's, unborn child but decides not to share it. He eventually becomes fond of Zaripa from <b>spending</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> with her and her children, but she does not return his affection and moves away one day when Yedigei travels to another junction to fetch his wandering camel. In consequence, Yedigei projects his anger onto Karanar by maiming him until he runs away again, only to later return famished and dilapidated.|$|E

25|$|Naomi and Liam {{start their}} {{relationship}} fresh. Naomi admits to Liam {{that she has}} been feigning interest in things he likes and that she needs to be true to herself, even if it means their relationship won't work. This is what Liam wants, and their relationship becomes more stable; however, when Naomi is forced to come clean over false rumors she spread claiming that she was sexually harassed by a teacher, Mr. Cannon, Liam decides that he needs a break from her. During this time, Annie and Liam become closer and he consoles her after she overhears her mother, Debbie, confessing to her father, Harry, that she kissed her yoga instructor. His consolation causes Annie to believe that Liam is flirting with her, but realizing that this was not his intent, Annie instead advises Liam to stay with Naomi, as she does not want to ruin her friendship again over a boy. Liam begins to have his own troubles when his father returns, pretending that he wants to have a relationship with his son. But when Liam steals very valuable coins from his stepfather in hopes of starting a life with his father, he abandons Liam. Naomi becomes distracted by her pregnant sister Jen returning to town and causing trouble for Naomi.

After Liam breaks up with her, a devastated Naomi is raped by Mr. Cannon, who tells her that after her initial false accusations, nobody will believe her.

Liam sees this and attacks Jasper as the police arrive.|$|E
500|$|Kapoor next {{appeared}} in his father's directorial Mausam (2011); co-starring Sonam Kapoor, the star-crossed romance set over a decade, took two years to complete. Considering the film to be his [...] "dream project", Kapoor did not take on additional work while filming for it. For his role as an unambitious village boy who becomes an air force pilot, Kapoor trained to fly the F-16 Fighting Falcon. Rajeev Masand reviewed that [...] "while he doesn’t quite cut it as a convincing IAF pilot, Shahid Kapoor is terrific as the small-town brat". The film was a box office flop and Kapoor was later regretful for <b>spending</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> on the project.|$|E
500|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) {{is proud}} that her mother, school system {{employee}} Marlene Knope (Pamela Reed), is {{to receive a}} public service award during an upcoming banquet. Ann (Rashida Jones), excited {{to go to a}} social event after <b>spending</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> taking care of her injured, freeloading boyfriend Andy (Chris Pratt), is told by Leslie to dress very formally. Leslie visits an old-fashioned barber, who unbeknownst to her only gives men's haircuts; she is given a very short, mannish hairstyle, which she is very proud of. Leslie and Ann, who is extremely overdressed in an expensive pink dress, arrive together at the banquet, where they are mistaken for a lesbian couple by many of the attendees. Tom (Aziz Ansari) sucks up to Marlene during his banquet speech, while Ron (Nick Offerman) sticks to a [...] "fact-based" [...] speech ("It is true that you have won this award.") ...|$|E

500|$|Following the show's {{cancellation}} in 2002, Rogen did not {{get many}} auditions, which was not upsetting {{to him as he}} always thought he would achieve better success as a writer. He would soon be a part of Apatow's [...] "frat pack", a close-knit group that includes Steve Carell and Paul Rudd. Of the awkwardness of a grown man <b>spending</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> with a teenaged Rogen, Apatow said: [...] "I'm such a comedy fan that, even though he's16, I know I'm hanging out with one of the guys who's {{going to be one of}} the great comics." [...] Around this time, Apatow would come up with odd requests for Rogen and Goldberg, such as turn an idea of his into a movie in 10 days and come up with 100 one-page ideas for films. Regarding Apatow's professional effect on Rogen, the actor said in 2009, [...] "Obviously, I can't stress how important Judd's been to my career".|$|E
500|$|Marie et Julien: The {{letter is}} from Madame X's sister Adrienne to Madame X. Julien meets Madame X again, {{and she tells}} him her sister killed herself by {{drowning}} six months before. He cannot understand who gave Marie the letter, but she insists that her sister left the letter to frame her and although dead she is [...] "reliving" [...] (a revenant) — and Marie is also. Adrienne —who though dead still appears and speaks to her— has told Madame X that Marie is [...] "like me". He thinks she is mad. Julien becomes frustrated at Marie <b>spending</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> alone in the attic. When she finally shows him the room, {{she says she does}} not know what it is for. She leaves before Julien wakes and checks into another hotel. He rings Marie's old boss who suggests talking to Marie's friend Delphine; Delphine says that Marie's relationship with Simon drove Marie mad and ended their friendship.|$|E
500|$|Common lyrical themes include {{technology}} and a resistance to change. Adrien Begrand, writing for PopMatters, described the lyrics on The Sophtware Slump as [...] "one's attempt {{to transcend the}} glut of technology in today's urban lifestyle, in search of something more real, more natural, more pastoral". Ben Sisario of The New York Times stated that the band [...] "provided the soundtrack to dot-com-era alienation, singing in a cracked yet still innocent voice of life spent staring into a computer screen". Ross Raihala, reviewing Sumday for Spin, identified what he called Lytle's [...] "geeky identification with technology". On The Sophtware Slump, CMJ writer Richard A. Martin commented on Lytle's [...] "sympathy for the lost souls and machines of the high-tech dot-com landscape". Lytle described his empathy with machines in 2003, stating [...] "I find it easier dealing with certain things by living through inanimate objects" [...] and how the song [...] "I'm on Standby" [...] is about Lytle relating to a mobile phone: [...] "I was <b>spending</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> learning the art of turning off, while still being 'on'".|$|E

2500|$|Meyer's {{original}} {{characters were}} unnamed; {{she took to}} calling the characters, who would later become Edward Cullen and Bella, 'he' and 'she' {{for the purpose of}} convenience as she, [...] "didn't want to lose the dream." [...] The name 'Isabella' was decided upon, Meyer explains, because [...] "after <b>spending</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> with , I loved her like a daughter. ...

2500|$|Another {{example is}} in The Tomb of the Cybermen when the Doctor is {{identified}} as [...] "English" [...] and, dissembling, plays along. Though David Tennant speaks with a natural Scottish accent, he played the Tenth Doctor with an Estuary accent (apart from when, in the Highlands-set episode [...] "Tooth and Claw" [...] the character is {{pretending to be a}} local). According to producer Russell T Davies, this was intended as a consequence of <b>spending</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> with Rose. [...] "The Christmas Invasion" [...] would have alluded to this, but the line was cut. [...] Davies also said that after Eccleston's accent, he did not want Tennant [...] "touring the regions" [...] with a Scottish one, and so asked Tennant to affect the same accent he used for the earlier BBC period drama Casanova.|$|E

2500|$|Stephen Maturin is the series' other hero. A former Irish radical, he is a ship's {{surgeon who}} has sailed with Aubrey {{since his first}} voyage as Commander. Unlike many {{surgeons}} in this era, Maturin is a physician, and is highly regarded for his intimate knowledge of anatomy and diseases. His skills have saved {{the lives of many}} of his shipmates. [...] He is acknowledged as a man of high breeding (The Fortune of War, p.48), and while on land he is consulted by such prominent figures as the Duke of Clarence. Maturin is also well known in the scientific community as a naturalist, specializing in comparative anatomy of birds but also willing to examine (and sometimes dissect) any interesting animal that crosses his path. His qualities as a doctor are only outshone by his skills as an intelligence agent, a profession only suspected by those he sails with but one by which he has occasionally confounded Napoleon's attempts at European domination. Despite <b>spending</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> aboard ships, Maturin has little knowledge of their qualities and terminology, which does not stop him from trying to explain various sailing terms and maneuvers to people even less informed. His appearance—small, pale, and usually dishevelled—does not make him very appealing to the opposite sex, but that does not deter him from trying to win the heart of the beautiful Diana Villiers. Unfortunately, Maturin, from what he claims is a spirit of pure philosophical enquiry, is a regular dabbler in any intoxicating drug that comes his way. Though skirting the line that separates [...] heavy use from addiction, he has dabbled in laudanum, a tincture of opium, coca leaves, and other local intoxicants ranging from bhang to khat, depending on where he happens to be at the moment. Maturin also has the sometimes distressing habit of bringing both live (wombats, a hive of bees, [...] "a most discriminating" [...] sloth) and dead animal (and human) specimens on board ship. Most are tolerated (even the bees) due to the crew's respect for Stephen's talents as a physician and natural philosopher, some, such as severed human hand and a narwhal's horn are seen as lucky talismans. He was born [...] "the wrong side of the blanket" [...] to an Irish father and a Catalan mother. He spent his childhood in both Ireland and Catalonia, and inherited land from his Catalan relatives. He is fluent in many languages, including English, Irish and Catalan from his upbringing, and French, Italian, Castilian Spanish and local dialects on the islands, Portuguese, Dutch, among others, and spent time learning Urdu on the long journey in HMS Surprise. On occasion he helps his shipmates out of a predicament by speaking one language in the accent of another, as part of the ruse de guerre common in the Royal Navy. He draws the line there, as his role on board ship is saving lives, not taking them. He makes an exception in The Letter of Marque, on the mission to cut out the French frigate Diane: he imprisons the intelligence officer, and then joins the fight on deck by coolly killing the ship's captain with his pistol and then his sword.|$|E

I've lived in this blessed place for fifty years, and I've never seen the spark of an idea, nor of any {{response}} to an idea, come out of a single one of you, all the time.

If you've got plenty to eat and drink, and a bit over to keep the missis quiet, you're satisfied. I never saw such a satisfied bloomin' lot in my life as you Barlow & Wasall's men are, really. Of course you can growse as well as anybody, and you do growse. But you don't do anything else. You're stuck in a sort of mud of contentment, and you feel yourselves sinking, but you make no efforts to get out. You bleat a bit, like sheep in a bog--but you like it, you know.

60|$|We are {{now come}} {{to the time when}} Rome became mixed up in wars with nations beyond Italy. There was a great {{settlement}} of the Phoenicians, the merchants of the old world, at Carthage, on the northern coast of Africa, the same place at which Virgil afterwards described Æneas as <b>spending</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time.</b> Dido, the queen who was said to have founded Carthage when fleeing from her wicked brother-in-law at Tyre, is thought to have been an old goddess, and the religion and manners of the Carthaginians were thoroughly Phoenician, or, as the Romans called them, Punic. They had no king, but a Senate, and therewith rulers called by the name that is translated as judges in the Bible; and they did not love war, only trade, and spread out their settlements for this purpose all over the coast of the Mediterranean, from Spain to the Black Sea, wherever a country had mines, wool, dyes, spices, or men to trade with; and their sailors were the boldest to be found anywhere, and were the only ones who had passed beyond the Pillars of Hercules, namely, the Straits of Gibraltar, in the Atlantic Ocean. They built handsome cities, and country houses with farms and gardens round them, and had all tokens of wealth and luxury--ivory, jewels, and spices from India, pearls from the Persian Gulf, gold from Spain, silver from the Balearic Isles, tin from the Scilly Isles, amber from the Baltic; and they had forts to protect their settlements. They generally hired the men of the countries, where they settled, to fight their battles, sometimes under hired Greek captains, but often under generals of their own.|$|E
