2500|$|On February 24, 2010, Dawn Brancheau, {{a female}} 40-year-old trainer with 16 years of {{experience}} at the park, died in another incident involving Tilikum. SeaWorld's head of animal training said that during a rubdown after the show, Tilikum pulled the trainer into the water by her ponytail, and she drowned. Eyewitness trainers and audience members, however, stated that Tilikum dragged her into the water by her left forearm, {{near the end of}} the show. The autopsy report said she died from drowning and traumatic injuries, including removal of her scalp. This was the third time since being first put on public display that Tilikum has been involved in a human death. By February 27, SeaWorld Orlando whale shows resumed with trainers practicing increased caution and not joining the whales in the water. SeaWorld announced they have invited experts from outside marine parks and aquariums to review SeaWorld's handling of killer whales and also Tilikum specifically. On August 23, 2010, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) fined the park US$75,000 for three infractions, two of which were directly related to this incident. One related citation was designated as [...] "willful" [...] and was [...] "committed with plain indifference to or intentional disregard for employee safety and health". The other related citation was a [...] "serious" [...] violation relating to a missing <b>safety</b> <b>rail</b> at Shamu Stadium. At the time of the fine, SeaWorld called OSHA's findings [...] "unfounded". Later hearings revealed that SeaWorld had concealed an earlier incident when another whale, Ikaika, had bitten a trainer in 2006. During a hearing where SeaWorld continued its challenge of OSHA's findings, former SeaWorld trainer Jeff Andrews - being presented as an expert - stated his opinion that the victim died as a result of a mistake she had made while near the water. He continued that he did not agree that Tilikum showed [...] "aggressive behavior" [...] during the incident. On May 31, 2012, Occupational Safety and Health Administration administrative law judge Ken Welsch cited SeaWorld for two violations in the death of the trainer and fined the company a total of $12,000. The final decision was issued on June 11, 2012.|$|E

50|$|In 1953 British Railways, as {{successor}} to the Great Western Railway, {{made it clear that}} closure of the passenger service was being considered. Public opinion generated considerable opposition, and it as agreed that a six month trial of an enhanced service would be made. 11 trains were run in each direction, and a range of cheap through tickets were offered. On 14 June 1954 a new halt was opened, at Cefntilla. The platform was less than 16 feet in length, with no ramps, and only a nameboard a <b>safety</b> <b>rail,</b> and a solitary lamp. However the trial demonstrated that little stimulus had been given to passenger business, and from 7 February 1955 the train service reverted to the former level of frequency.|$|E
5000|$|Joughin {{then went}} into the deck pantry on A Deck {{to get a drink}} of water and, whilst there, he heard a loud crash, [...] "as if part of the ship had buckled". He left the pantry, and joined the crowd running aft toward the poop deck. As he was {{crossing}} the well deck, the ship suddenly gave a list over to port and, according to him, threw everyone in the well in a bunch except for him. Joughin climbed to the starboard side of the poop deck, getting hold of the <b>safety</b> <b>rail</b> so that he was {{on the outside of the}} ship as it went down by the head. As the ship finally sank, Joughin rode it down as if it were an elevator, not getting his head under the water (in his words, his head [...] "may have been wetted, but no more").

50|$|In 2014 a bid {{was made}} by the Trust to re-build the open coach, {{converted}} in 1962 from one of the ex Nocton Class D wagons, into a disabled friendly passenger vehicle. After winning a vote in the 'Peoples Millions' competition run by ITV the Trust was awarded £43,400 to do the work, and the project was completed by the end of 2015. The 'D' class bogie wagon has been returned to its original appearance apart from the addition of a <b>safety</b> <b>rail</b> above the sides and ends of the vehicle, and the inclusion of a small door in one of the drop sides of the wagon for the loading and unloading of passengers and wheelchairs. Seating is provided in the form of boxes resembling WW1 ammunition boxes secured around the sides of the vehicle. The platform at Wall's Lane (former Lakeview) station has also been extended and upgraded to accommodate a two coach train, and provide disabled access to the trains.

50|$|Trang died on September 3, 2001 near San Francisco after a car accident. She was 27 years old. Trang {{and former}} actress/model Angela Rockwood (for whom Trang {{was to be}} a bridesmaid in her then-upcoming {{marriage}} to Dustin Nguyen) were passengers in a car traveling on Interstate 5 between San Francisco and Los Angeles. They were returning late at night from visiting Rockwood-Nguyen's maid of honor when the driver (also one of the bridesmaids) lost control. The car swerved violently across the road before hitting the roadside rock face and flipping several times before hitting the <b>safety</b> <b>rail</b> and plunging over the bank. Rockwood-Nguyen (who has claimed both that she was and was not wearing a seat belt in different interviews) survived after being thrown out of the vehicle through a window before its final impact; having suffered catastrophic injuries, she was rendered a quadraplegic. It is unknown whether Trang or the driver were wearing seat-belts. The driver survived the accident; however, Trang died before reaching the hospital, due to the internal injuries she had sustained.|$|E

40|$|Background: In train driving, {{a signal}} passed at danger (SPAD) event is a {{significant}} mode of safe working failure that has implications for network <b>safety,</b> <b>rail</b> service delivery, and train driver welfare. Human-error related SPAD outcomes are frequently attributed to driver distraction, but very little rail research has sought to explore distractors that not only divert attention, but also subvert the regulation of safety-performance goals. Aim: The aim {{of this paper was}} to provide a better understanding of SPAD-risk factors from the perspective of task-related distraction in passenger train drivers operating in Australia and New Zealand. Method: Data were collected using a qualitative methodology that combined focus groups with a novel and generative technique designed to stimulate situational insight. In total, twenty-eight train drivers participated from 8 different passenger rail organisations. Data were analysed in a combined deductive and inductive thematic framework. Results: The data revealed several common risk factors to train driver distraction consistent with misprioritised attention. The experience of time-keeping pressure and station dwelling created tensions between safety and performance. These issues interacted with sighting restrictions to disconnect the driver from their route knowledge. Conclusion: The findings implicated significant SPAD-risk from task-related distraction, and suggested the experience of distraction was intensified when time-keeping pressure, station dwelling and sighting restrictions converged...|$|E
