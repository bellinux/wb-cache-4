60|$|The whole domain is shut up {{from the}} street by a great porte-cochère, or portal, {{calculated}} for the admission of carriages. This consists of two massy folding-doors, that swing heavily open upon a spacious entrance, passing under {{the front of the}} edifice into the courtyard. On one side is a spacious staircase leading to the upper apartments. Immediately without the portal is the porter's lodge, a small room with one or two bedrooms adjacent, for the accommodation of the concierge, or porter and his family. This {{is one of the most}} important functionaries of the hotel. He is, in fact, the Cerberus of the establishment, and no one can pass in or out without his knowledge and consent. The porte-cochère in general is fastened by a <b>sliding</b> <b>bolt,</b> from which a cord or wire passes into the porter's lodge. Whoever wishes to go out must speak to the porter, who draws the bolt. A visitor from without gives a single rap with the massive knocker; the bolt is immediately drawn, as if by an invisible hand; the door stands ajar, the visitor pushes it open, and enters. A face presents itself at the glass door of the porter's little chamber; the stranger pronounces the name of the person he comes to seek. If the person or family is of importance, occupying the first or second floor, the porter sounds a bell once or twice, to give notice that a visitor is at hand. The stranger in the meantime ascends the great staircase, the highway common to all, and arrives at the outer door, equivalent to a street door, of the suite of rooms inhabited by his friends.|$|E
6000|$|... '"It {{is always}} the {{unexpected}} that happens," [...] I said in a propitiatory tone. My obtuseness provoked him into a contemptuous [...] "Pshaw!" [...] I suppose he meant that the unexpected couldn't touch him; {{nothing less than the}} unconceivable itself could get over his perfect state of preparation. He had been taken unawares--and he whispered to himself a malediction upon the waters and the firmament, upon the ship, upon the men. Everything had betrayed him! He had been tricked into that sort of high-minded resignation which prevented him lifting as much as his little finger, while these others who had a very clear perception of the actual necessity were tumbling against each other and sweating desperately over that boat business. Something had gone wrong there at the last moment. It appears that in their flurry they had contrived in some mysterious way to get the <b>sliding</b> <b>bolt</b> of the foremost boat-chock jammed tight, and forthwith had gone out of the remnants of their minds over the deadly nature of that accident. It must have been a pretty sight, the fierce industry of these beggars toiling on a motionless ship that floated quietly in the silence of a world asleep, fighting against time for the freeing of that boat, grovelling on all-fours, standing up in despair, tugging, pushing, snarling at each other venomously, ready to kill, ready to weep, and only kept from flying at each other's throats by the fear of death that stood silent behind them like an inflexible and cold-eyed taskmaster. Oh yes! It must have been a pretty sight. He saw it all, he could talk about it with scorn and bitterness; he had a minute knowledge of it by means of some sixth sense, I conclude, because he swore to me he had remained apart without a glance at them and at the boat--without one single glance. And I believe him. I should think he was too busy watching the threatening slant of the ship, the suspended menace discovered {{in the midst of the}} most perfect security--fascinated by the sword hanging by a hair over his imaginative head.|$|E

The <b>sliding</b> <b>bolt,</b> when extended, mechanically prevents operation of a switch, valve, gate, or other device. Many variations exist, with different shapes of interlock bolt and multiple lock cylinders on an interlock. A significant feature of the interlock is that the key is held or trapped in one position of the lock. Releasing the key indicates that the interlocked device has been made safe; the interlocked device cannot be re-energized until the key has been returned and operated to retract the bolt.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the stove}} metaphor {{there is an}} {{illustration}} of placement {{in relation to the}} controls; however, the effect of the control in relation to its operation is Heat as a result of Rotation.

A simple <b>slide</b> <b>bolt</b> with a knob has a very direct mapping, whereas, one with a rotating lever requires the understanding of the transformation of the rotation translated into the movement of the bolt horizontally. From this perspective, mapping is a characterstic of affordance. A deeper understanding of many our perceived 'natural' mapping relationships uncovers a predominately socially constructed, or cultural, underpinning. Such as rotating a volume knob to make the music volume go 'up'.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:This paper {{presents}} the calculation optimization for {{two examples of}} anchored slope, in respect of structural plane involved failures and circular slides by finite element method (FEM).

FOREWORD Despite various forms of appearance, slope failures can generally be classified as structural plane involved and non-structural plane involved [1]; the latter is also known as circular <b>slides.</b> <b>Bolt</b> anchorage has long been used for slope stabilization and proved to be fairly effective. In the finite element calculation the maximum pull-out resistance of the rock bolt is to be analyzed in two methods [2] [3]: one is to perform the stability monitoring {{on the assumption that the}} slope would reach the point of overall failure when the axial force on the rock bolt — during strength reduction by FEM — reaches the maximum pull-out resistance.

5000|$|The {{next major}} change in shutter {{hardware}} coincided with the American Civil War era. By this time the industrial revolution was fully mature. Heavy presses and punches were in use in factories {{around the country and}} a maturing rail transportation system opened up the inland areas for the products of the factories. Iron was the norm up until that time - steel (a mixture of iron and carbon, and much stronger than iron alone) had been very expensive to produce. With the Bessemer blast furnace steel suddenly became less expensive and readily available. Hardware makers were quick {{to take advantage of this}} new material. They produce the first of the [...] "butt" [...] and [...] "H" [...] or [...] "Parliament" [...] style lift-off hinges. Quick and easy to produce and now strong enough to hold heavy shutters thanks to the steel from which they were made, they quickly found favor in the new construction of the period. Strap hinges were still very much in evidence, however, and the venerable <b>slide</b> <b>bolt</b> was still the only option in the hardware store.|$|R

The split brake pedal is also used in mud or soft soil to control a tire spinning due to loss of traction. The operator presses both pedals together to stop the tractor. Usually a swinging or <b>sliding</b> <b>bolt</b> is provided to lock the two together when desired.|$|E
50|$|To {{gain the}} {{superior}} hitting {{power of the}} larger 7.7mm cartridge, several caliber 6.5mm Type 38 rifles were modified for the new round. Although the tests proved satisfactory, the army decided that the added recoil and larger chambering for the 7.7mm cartridge, would require an entirely new rifle for the cartridge. It utilized a cock-on-closing action and an unusual safety mechanism, operated by pressing in the large knurled disk {{at the rear of}} the bolt with the palm of the hand and rotating it in a 1/8 clockwise turn, which is often misunderstood by Western shooters who are used to the Mauser's thumb lever safety. It featured a quick-release bolt and antiaircraft sights, as well as a <b>sliding</b> <b>bolt</b> cover and monopod. The bolt cover, in particular, was highly problematic. Many soldiers simply discarded them due to excessive rattling. As a bolt-action rifle, the Type 99 was a very solid weapon, but as with all manually operated rifles used during World War II, they were in most close combat situations outclassed by semi-automatic rifles and submachine guns.|$|E
5000|$|The next prison, {{now known}} as the [...] "Old Gaol," [...] was {{constructed}} in an attempt to correct all that was wrong about the previous one. It was built in 1832 on Frederick Street in St. Andrews at the cost of £3,393, a very large sum for the time. Massive slabs of gray granite were cut in Perry, Maine and laid as the floors, ceilings and walls of the prison. Cell doors were made of solid iron, each with a <b>sliding</b> <b>bolt</b> to keep the door closed at all times. The only source of light was the small hole in the door used for delivering food to the prisoners and a small window measuring four inches wide and twelve inches high. Doorways were made very narrow so that a prisoner, no matter their size, would have trouble overpowering the Gaoler if they were being let out of the cell for any reason. The only source of heat was a small wood stove {{at the end of the}} corridor outside of the cells, leading a Gaoler in the 1930s to add wooden walls to the cells in an effort to keep them warmer. Unfortunately, this approach led the cells to be only colder as it kept the warmth of the stove outside of the cells. These ten cells were used exclusively for male prisoners. They occupy the first floor of the Gaol and are six by eight feet in size. The cells are cold, claustrophobic and bereft of any comfort, which was the exact intention of their construction.|$|E
5000|$|In contrast, a single-action (SA) {{semi-automatic}} pistol must be cocked {{by first}} operating the <b>slide</b> or <b>bolt,</b> or, if a round is already chambered, by cocking the hammer manually.

All SA semi-automatic pistols exhibit this feature, and automatically cock the hammer when the slide is first [...] "racked" [...] to chamber a round. A round can also be manually inserted in the chamber with the slide locked back. Then the safety can be applied.|$|R

MethodsProspectively throughout 2011, patients with unstable fractures transtrochanteric undergoing osteosynthesis with cephalomedullary nail using antirotacional device. They were evaluated for sex, age and fracture classification according to Tronzo. Through digital radiographs angle reduction, tip apex distance (TAD), stem diameter and measures between the positioning of the screws {{and the limits of}} the cervix were measured. ResultsOf the 58 patients, 42 (72. 4 %) were female and 16 (27. 6 %) were male. 33 patients were classified as Tronzo III (56. 9 %), 6 patients as Tronzo IV (10. 4 %) and 19 as Tronzo V (19. 8 %). The majority were in between the eighth and ninth decade of life. The average reduction in the angle was 130. 05 ° for females and 129. 4 ° for males. The TAD average was 19. 7 mm for females and 21. 6 for males. The average diameter of the neck and head vary with statistical significance between men and women. In 19 patients the placement of the <b>sliding</b> <b>bolt</b> can be optimal.

40|$|Door locking is the {{mechanism}} for access, control and security {{that relies on}} a veiled knowledge of mechanics. However, {{as a symbol of}} power, authority, wealth and stature, it can reveal many cultural, economic and social practices and habits. The subject of ancient classical technology of door locking progress mechanisms is full of interest, and has received the considerable attention during the last two centuries including recent years. However, it has not been until now subject of many scholarly studies, that examine issues such as types, operational function and mechanism technology, access feature and security, and manufacturing based on recent archaeological data and findings. This paper attempts to present a comparative critical assessment and investigation of the mechanical and typological evaluation technology, mainly of the so-called Homeric, the simple and smart Hellenistic tumbler Laconian, in addition to the main advanced and elegant door Roman locking with spring mechanism. The paper shall address mainly the Hellenistic gap in material studies, according to recent archaeological records and findings. It suggests that door locking utilizing spring technology is Hellenistic and not Roman as it was believed. In addition the paper attempts to clarify and present some new aspects and suggestions of several misunderstandings about the locking systems origin and the know-how of controlling the <b>sliding</b> <b>bolt</b> horizontal movement. These aspects will be critically discussed and clarified through 2 D and 3 D graphical reconstructions and models...|$|E
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{difficulties}} with implementing the innovative components and systems conceived in the I 3 CON project on a dwelled building (because of their early stage of development), {{one of the main}} demonstration activities was building a Mock-up module to test the feasibility (in terms of physical integration and logical interoperability) of these components and systems, and evaluate their overall performance. The design of all the systems involved in the Mock-up has the aim to develop new and more efficient solutions for the common issues in housing and, at the same time, to allow the evaluation of these systems. The values to be measured and monitored are: water (hot and cold), electricity and energy consumptions; temperature (ambient and surface) and relative humidity degree, both indoor and outdoor; presence; water temperature and flow; CO 2 concentration; and light level. This is done by means of a network of sensors, meters and actuators deployed throughout the Mock-up. The following components and systems have been developed by I 3 CON partners and are implemented in the Mock-up, namely: - Façade panels, by Dragados (DRA). - Electro-chromic windows, by Saint-Gobain Recherche (SGR). - Under-floor radiant heating, Water saving system and Domestic fire extinguishing system, by Uponor (UPO). - Multi-service trunking system, by the University of Loughborough (LOU). - Wireless sensor network, by Thales Research & Technologies (TRT). All these systems are controlled by the Building Operating System (BOS) developed by Lonix (LON). Besides, all that information handled by the BOS can be accessed through Mobile Productivity Tools developed by Intracom (ICOM) for carrying out operation and maintenance tasks. Regarding the architectural design of the Mock-up, the innovative effort has been aimed to the development of new prefabricated façade solutions adapting current manufacturing processes, such as the “Sandwich Framex” typology, and the improvement in the thermal and acoustical behaviour of the Mock-up envelope with passive strategies, e. g. by using Phase Change Materials (PCMs) or vegetation. The façade panels of the Mock-up were made up according to one of the following structural configurations, all of them making use of Glass-fibre Reinforced Concrete (GRC) : - GRC Stud-frame: GRC shell attached to a metallic frame. Two panels feature this solution, with a special plasterboard interior sheathing enhanced with PCM micro-capsules whose behaviour will be compared to that of a conventional one. - GRC Sandwich: panel anchored to the main structure by means of cast-in channels and <b>sliding</b> <b>bolt</b> connections to accommodate the assembly tolerances. The innermost surface features a special pattern to improve the acoustical behaviour by diminishing the reverberation time. The outmost surface is covered with different kinds of light composite panels for aesthetics reasons. - Sandwich Framex: it is an evolution which comprises “indoor sandwich + metallic frame + external elements”. One of the main advantages of the Sandwich Framex is the flexibility of the external cladding, which may consist of a great variety of elements configured in a modular way over a common sub-structure (the steel frame) and can be installed {{so that they can be}} easily disassembled for maintenance or upgrade. Different external elements have been selected in response both to bio-climatic concepts and architectural trends, among others: photo-voltaic cells, vegetated modules and a variety of composite/laminated panels. Two of the Mock-up façades which are configured with this solution include, besides, PCM packed in plastic boxes within the sandwich core, in order to improve thermal behaviour. For the sake of a better thermal efficiency, visual comfort (in terms of glare) and privacy, an Electro-Chromic Glazing Unit (ECGU) has been provided in one of the Mock-up rooms. The ECGU is fitted into a standard window frame allowing electrical power and control cabling. The ECGU makes possible certain degrees of shading that are controlled by the BOS according to solar irradiance, presence and indoor temperature, and operated in conjunction with the HVAC system thanks to the integration of all the systems within the BOS. The Water Saving System consists in re-circulating the hot water only when it is needed. The system is connected to the sensor network in the building, and is activated whenever a person is within a predetermined area (kitchen or bathroom) or the water temperature inside the pipes is lower than a set value. Thanks to this solution, less water is wasted and there is less waiting time for hot water to be delivered. The Domestic Fire Extinguisher System stands out for its simplicity: the water supply for the toilet cistern passes through the sprinklers. Thus, every time the toilet is flushed, confirmation is provided that there is no impediment for the water to flow (e. g. incrustations due to hard water) and therefore the system would work if a fire started. The Under-Floor Heating (UFH) system has been installed over the floor concrete slab. Its main virtue is its reduced installation height which makes it especially suitable for renovation works. The use of Cross-linked Polyethylene (PEX) pipes for these systems, installed using the “pipe-in-pipe” method, facilitates the renovation of the pipes given the case. The Multi-Services Trunking System (MSTS) is a very innovative concept that comprises a set of runs for different kinds of media incorporated within a single vertical major artery and horizontal distribution nodes. The MSTS has been manufactured using rapid prototyping techniques, and a small portion has been installed in the Mock-up for proving the concept, delivering hot and cold water, air and electricity. Concerning the monitoring and control of the Mock-up, the following inputs are studied: - Consumptions measured with metering devices: Cold and hot water; Electricity. - Parameters measured by the WSN: CO 2 concentration; Presence by means of Passive Infra-Red (PIR) technology; Relative Humidity (RH) degree; Light level; and Indoor ambient temperature. There is a gateway that converts the radio messages transmitted by the sensors into TCP/IP messages accessible from the BOS. - Sensors deployed at different layers of the façade panels: Ambient and surface temperatures; Relative humidity degree. They are intended to assess the overall performance of the envelope system, with a focus on the effect of PCMs and vegetation. - Parameters measured with wired sensors: Presence; Light level; Water temperature and flow in the pipes; and Ambient and surface temperature (indoor and outdoor). Based on the information gathered by the sensor network, the BOS controls the Mock-up handling the following signals: Readings from the metering devices; Inputs from the sensors located in the kitchen, the bathroom and the test rooms; Data from the HVAC and UFH systems (controlled individually for each room to allow comparisons between them), the heat pump and the water pumps (for consumption simulation); Signals from the façade panels’ temperature and relative humidity degree sensors. Remote access to the Mock-up monitoring and control systems is very important for the measurement plans. Internet connection plays an important role for accessing the data and carrying out dwelling usage simulations. Furthermore, the application of Mobile Productivity Tools (MPTs), for example a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) carried out by the maintenance staff, makes possible that any relevant information about the equipment installed in the building (i. e. the Mock-up), such as the assembly drawings, location in the building lay-out, and any data accessible from the BOS, will be available in real time for the operator working on site. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________En vista de las dificultades para implementar los innovadores componentes y sistemas concebidos en el proyecto I 3 CON en una vivienda habitada (debido a su temprano estado de desarrollo), una de las actividades principales de demostración fue construir un Módulo prototipo para ensayar la viabilidad (en términos de integración física e inter-operatividad lógica) de estos componentes y sistemas y evaluar su comportamiento global. El diseño de todos los sistemas del Módulo tiene como objetivo desarrollar nuevas y más eficientes soluciones a problemas comunes en vivienda y, al mismo tiempo, permitir la evaluación de dichos sistemas. Los valores a medir y monitorizar son: consumos de agua (caliente y fría), electricidad y energía; temperatura (ambiente y superficial) y grado de humedad relativo, tanto interior como exterior; presencia; temperatura y flujo de agua; concentración de CO 2; y nivel de luz. Esto se hace mediante una red de sensores, contadores y actuadores desplegados a lo largo del Módulo. Los siguientes componentes y sistemas han sido desarrollados por socios de I 3 CON e implementados en el Módulo, a saber: - Paneles de fachada, por Dragados (DRA). - Ventanas electro-crómicas, por Saint-Gobain Recherche (SGR). - Calefacción por suelo radiante, Sistema de ahorro de agua y Sistema doméstico de extinción de incendios, por Uponor (UPO). - Sistema de conductos multi-servicio, por la Universidad de Loughborough (LOU). - Red de sensores inalámbricos, por Thales Research & Technologies (TRT). Todos estos sistemas se controlan mediante el Sistema Operativo del Edificio (BOS) desarrollado por Lonix (LON). Además, a toda esa información manejada por el BOS puede accederse a través de las Herramientas de Productividad Móviles de Intracom (ICOM) para operación y mantenimiento. Respecto al diseño arquitectónico del Módulo, el esfuerzo innovador se ha centrado en el desarrollo de nuevas soluciones de fachada prefabricada adaptando procesos de fabricación existentes, tales como la tipología “Sándwich Framex”, y en la mejora del comportamiento térmico y acústico de los cerramientos del Módulo mediante estrategias pasivas, e. g. usando Materiales de Cambio de Fase (PCMs) o vegetación. Los paneles de fachada del Módulo se configuraron según alguna de las siguientes soluciones estructurales, todas ellas usando Hormigón Reforzado con fibra de Vidrio (GRC) : GRC Stud-frame: cáscara de GRC unida a un bastidor metálico. Dos paneles se configuran con esta solución, con la particularidad de un trasdosado interior de yeso-cartón con micro-cápsulas de PCM cuyo comportamiento se comparará con el de uno convencional. - GRC Sándwich: panel anclado a la estructura principal por medio de carriles embebidos y tornillería deslizante para acomodar las tolerancias de ensamblaje. La cara interior lleva un patrón especial para mejorar el comportamiento acústico disminuyendo el tiempo de reverberación. La cara exterior se termina con diferentes paneles ligeros de material compuesto por motivos estéticos. - Sándwich Framex: es una evolución que consiste en “sándwich interno + bastidor metálico + elementos externos”. Una de las principales ventajas del Sándwich Framex es la flexibilidad para los acabados exteriores, que pueden consistir en un gran variedad de elementos modulares sobre una sub-estructura común (el bastidor metálico) y ser instalados de manera que sean fácilmente desmontables para mantenimiento o renovación. Se han seleccionado distintos elementos exteriores en respuesta a conceptos bio-climáticos y tendencias arquitectónicas, entre otros: células foto-voltaicas, módulos vegetados y varios paneles de material compuesto/laminados. Dos fachadas del Módulo con esta solución incluyen además PCM empaquetado en contenedores de plástico dentro del núcleo del sándwich para mejorar el comportamiento térmico. En aras de una mejor eficiencia térmica, confort visual (deslumbramiento) y privacidad, se ha provisto una Unidad de Acristalamiento Electro-Crómico (ECGU) en uno de los recintos del Módulo. La ECGU se instala en una carpintería estándar que permita el cableado eléctrico y de control. La ECGU permite ciertos grados de oscurecimiento que se controlan por el BOS en función de la irradiación solar, presencia y temperatura interior, y se opera junto con el sistema de climatización gracias a la integración de todos los sistemas en el BOS. El Sistema de Ahorro de Agua consiste en recircular el agua caliente sólo cuando es necesario. El sistema está conectado a la red de sensores del edificio y se activa cuando una persona está dentro de un área determinada (cocina o baño) o si el agua de las tuberías baja de una cierta temperatura. Gracias a esta solución se desperdicia menos agua y hay que esperar menos tiempo a que salga agua caliente. El Sistema Doméstico de Extinción de Incendios destaca por su simplicidad: el agua que va a la cisterna pasa a través de los rociadores. Así, cada vez que se tira de la cadena, se confirma que no hay ningún impedimento al flujo de agua (e. g. incrustaciones de cal) y por lo tanto el sistema funcionaría si se iniciase un incendio. La Calefacción por Suelo Radiante (UFH) se ha instalado sobre el forjado de hormigón. Su principal virtud es su reducida altura, que lo hace especialmente indicado para rehabilitaciones. El uso de tuberías de Polietileno Reticulado (PEX) para estos sistemas, empleando el método de “tubo-en-tubo”, facilita su renovación llegado el caso. El Sistema de Conductos Multi-Servicio (MSTS) es un concepto muy innovador que consta de un conjunto de canalizaciones para distintos medios agrupados en una única arteria vertical y nodos de distribución horizontal. El MSTS se ha fabricado con técnicas de prototipado rápido y se ha instalado un pequeño segmento en el Módulo para demostrar el concepto, distribuyendo agua fría y caliente, aire y electricidad. En cuanto a la monitorización y control del Módulo, se estudian las siguientes entradas: - Consumos medidos con contadores: Agua fría y caliente; Energía eléctrica. - Parámetros medidos por la WSN: CO 2; Presencia con tecnología Pasiva Infra-Roja (PIR); Grado de Humedad Relativa (RH); Nivel de luz; y Temperatura ambiente interior. Hay una pasarela que convierte los mensajes de radio transmitidos por los sensores en mensajes TCP/IP accesibles desde el BOS. - Sensores desplegados en las diferentes capas de las fachadas: Temperaturas ambiente y superficial; Grado de humedad relativa. Se pretende evaluar el comportamiento global del cerramiento, en especial el efecto de los PCMs y la vegetación. - Parámetros medidos con sensores cableados: Presencia; Nivel de luz; Temperatura y flujo de agua en las tuberías; y Temperaturas ambiente y superficial (interior y exterior). Basándose en la información recogida por la red de sensores, el BOS controla el Módulo manejando las siguientes señales: Lecturas de los aparatos contadores; Entradas de los sensores ubicados en cocina, baño y las habitaciones de ensayo; Datos de los sistemas de climatización y suelo radiante (controlados individualmente en cada habitación para poder hacer comparaciones), de la bomba de calor y las de agua (para simular consumos); Señales de temperatura y humedad relativa de los paneles de fachada. El acceso remoto a los sistemas de monitorización y control del Módulo es muy importante para el plan de medidas. La conexión a internet juega un papel fundamental para acceder a los datos y simular el uso de la vivienda. Además, la aplicación de Herramientas de Productividad Móviles (MPTs), por ejemplo una PDA que lleve el personal de mantenimiento, posibilita que información relevante acerca de los equipos instalados en el edificio (esto es, del Módulo), tales como dibujos de montaje, localización en el plano del edificio, y cualquier dato accesible desde el BOS, esté disponible en tiempo real para el operario trabajando en el sitio.

60|$|We now {{worked in}} earnest, and never did I pass {{ten minutes of}} more intense excitement. During this {{interval}} we had fairly unearthed an oblong chest of wood, which, from its perfect preservation and wonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected to some mineralizing process--perhaps that of the Bi-chloride of Mercury. This box was three feet and a half long, three feet broad, and {{two and a half}} feet deep. It was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron, riveted, and forming a kind of open trelliswork over the whole. On each side of the chest, near the top, were three rings of iron--six in all--by means of which a firm hold could be obtained by six persons. Our utmost united endeavors served only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its bed. We at once saw the impossibility of removing so great a weight. Luckily, the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two <b>sliding</b> <b>bolts.</b> These we drew back--trembling and panting with anxiety. In an instant, a treasure of incalculable value lay gleaming before us. As the rays of the lanterns fell within the pit, there flashed upwards a glow and a glare, from a confused heap of gold and of jewels, that absolutely dazzled our eyes.|$|R
50|$|The BT-4 Combat is a poppet valve, blow-back marker; the <b>bolt</b> <b>slides</b> {{forward to}} open the valve, and air {{released}} from the valve propels the paintball forward and recocks the bolt for another shot. The stock BT-4 Combat includes adjustable handgrip and rear sight, sliding feedneck, and 8 inch barrel.|$|R
50|$|Connected to the {{midpoint}} of the rotating lever is a long metal arm. The motion of the lever causes this arm to be forced rearward, pushing the entire breech mechanism with it. The rear end of this mechanism presses on the cam, forcing the bolt upward and unlocking it. Continued motion <b>slides</b> the <b>bolt</b> rearward against the spring, while also operating the mechanism that feeds the ammunition belt and readies the next round. When it reaches the end of its motion the spring pushes everything forward again, carrying the new bullet with it and seating it in the barrel before locking again.|$|R
5000|$|Spring-powered airsoft guns (or [...] "air-cocking guns" [...] as {{called by}} Tokyo Marui) are single-shot devices {{that use the}} elastic {{potential}} energy stored within a compressed coil spring to drive a piston air pump, which is released upon trigger-pull and rapidly pressurizes the air within the pump cylinder to in turn [...] "blow" [...] pellets down the gun barrel. The user must recompress the spring under stress prior to each shot, typically by manually pulling back the <b>slide</b> (pistols), <b>bolt</b> handle (rifles) or forend pump (shotguns) on the weapon, which cocks and readies the gun. Because of this, spring guns are by design incapable of automatic or semi-automatic firing.|$|R
50|$|This sub-variant reintroduced a {{box-shaped}} biplane {{tail unit}} which improved the aircraft's control response {{when it was}} being flown on one engine. Another modification was the installation of a third 7.92 mm (.312 in) machine gun to combat British night fighters, which often attacked German bombers from below where they were hard to spot but the bomber's silhouette {{was easy to see}} against the night sky. This gun was mounted on a tubular, <b>sliding</b> mounting <b>bolted</b> {{to the floor of the}} rear gunner's position and was fired downward through a small sloping gun-tunnel cut into the bottom of the rear fuselage. By the last year of the war, the G.IIIa had replaced the G.III in production.|$|R
25|$|The bolt in {{the bolt}} lock is a {{rectangle}} of metal that is constrained to slide only back and forward. When the knife is open a spring biases the bolt to the forward position where it rests above the tang {{of the blade}} preventing the blade from closing. Small knobs extend through {{the handle of the}} knife on both sides allowing the user to <b>slide</b> the <b>bolt</b> backwards freeing the knife to close. The Axis Lock used by knife maker Benchmade is functionally identical to the bolt lock except that it uses a cylinder rather than a rectangle to trap the blade. The Arc Lock by knife maker SOG is similar to the Axis Lock except the cylinder follows a curved path rather than a straight path.|$|R
50|$|The receiver, {{rotating}} <b>bolt,</b> <b>slide,</b> {{and short}} stroke gas piston used on this first prototype were designed {{based on those}} used by Williams to produce the 7 1/2 pound Winchester Model G30R. Of these four parts, three were designed by Williams from parts already in use on other rifles. The one part Williams could take credit for was the short stroke gas piston that accessed the high pressure gas near the breech to operate the semi-automatic action.|$|R
40|$|Rounded {{shoulder}} on bushing ensures repeatable stop position. Improved {{stop mechanism}} allows airflow slot on circulation-control airfoil {{to be limited}} to precise width. Shoulder bushing installed in duct so shoulder rests on inside surface of duct. <b>Bolt</b> <b>slides</b> in bushing in duct wall between more open and less open positions. No relative motion or wear between bolt and slot panel. Prevents bushing from being dislodged by stop forces and provides stiffer stopping surface than sleeve bushing bonded in duct wall...|$|R
50|$|Stripping is simple: Safety on, remove magazine, cock {{and hold}} bolt open, rotate to left, inspect bolt face and chamber, release bolt under control. Then grab butt, press catch on bottom of {{receiver}} with other hand, rotate butt to left 90 degree and pull off. Remove spring, release safety, tip barrel up and pull {{so that the}} trigger <b>bolt</b> <b>slides</b> out. Assemble in reverse. Suggested ranges for use were 25 meters from the hip snap shooting 100 meters using sights.|$|R
