40|$|Sorption of cesium and {{strontium}} on kaolinite powders {{was investigated}} {{as a means}} to minimize the emissions of these metals during certain high temperature processes currently being developed to isolate and dispose of radiological and mixed wastes. In this work, non-radioactive aqueous cesium <b>acetate</b> or <b>strontium</b> <b>acetate</b> was atomized down the center of a natural gas flame supported on a variable-swirl burner in a refractory-lined laboratory-scale combustion facility. Kaolinite powder was injected at a post-flame location in the combustor. Cesium readily vaporizes in the high temperature regions of the combustor, but was reactively scavenged onto dispersed kaolinite. Global sorption mechanisms of cesium vapor on kaolinite were quantified, and are related to those available in the literature for sodium and lead. Both metal adsorption and substrate deactivation steps are important, and so there is an optimum temperature, between 1400 and 1500 K, at which maximum sorption occurs. The presence of chlorine inhibits cesium sorption. In contrast to cesium, {{and in the absence of}} chlorine, strontium was only partially vaporized and was, therefore, only partially scavengeable. The strontium data did not allow quantification of global kinetic mechanisms of interaction, although equilibrium arguments provided insight into the effects of chlorine on strontium sorption. These results have implications for the use of sorbents to control cesium and strontium emissions during high temperature waste processing including incineration and vitrification...|$|R

Sr-modified Ti surfaces were produced by sequential treatments with NaOH, <b>strontium</b> <b>acetate,</b> heat and water. The surface characteristics and the concentration of the Sr ions released from the samples were examined. Cell adhesion, morphology and growth were investigated using osteoblasts isolated from the calvaria of neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats. Expression of osteogenesis-related genes and proteins was examined to assess {{the effect of the}} Sr-modified Ti surfaces on osteoblasts. The modified titanium surface had a mesh structure with significantly greater porosity, and approximately 5. 37 ± 0. 35 at. % of Sr was incorporated into the surface. The hydrophilicity was enhanced by the incorporation of Sr ions and water treatment. The average amounts of Sr released from the Sr-modified plates subjected to water treatment were slight higher than the plates without water treatment. Sr promoted cellular adhesion, spreading and growth compared with untreated Ti surfaces. The Sr-modified Ti plates also promoted expression of osteogenesis-related genes,and expression of OPN and COL-І by osteoblasts. Ti plates heat treated at 700 °C showed increased bioactivity in comparison with those treated at 600 °C. Water treatment upregulated the expression of osteogenesis-related genes.

Participant’s DH was evaluated at baseline and after 3 days using Airblast, Tactile, Cold water and Subjective tests. Results: The final sample consisted of 85 subjects: 29 received the arginine-based dentifrice (group 1); 27 the strontium acetate-based dentifrice (group 2); 29 the dentifrice based on zinc-carbonate hydroxyapatite (group 3). All dentifrices were largely effective to reduce DH: the percentage of score reduction from baseline to 3 days was greater than 30 % for all tests (except for subjective test of group 2). The comparison among the three dentifrices showed that after 3 days there was an improvement in Airblast (mean percentage of reduction 39. 2 % in group 1; 42. 0 % in group 2; 39. 2 % in group 3), Cold water (41. 5 %; 51. 8 %; 50 %), Tactile (50. 3 %; 40. 1 %; 33. 8 %) and Subjective (33. 1 %; 17. 4 %; 31. 4 %) test scores, with differences being significant for Cold Water and Subjective tests. For Airblast and Tactile tests there were no significant differences across groups at 3 days. Moreover, no significant differences at any test were observed in a subset of patients that were followed up to 8 weeks: all dentifrices were all highly efficacious. Conclusions: This study documented that the three tested dentifrices significantly reduced DH after 3 -day treatment, supporting their utility in clinical practice.

40|$|Abstract. In {{recent years}} several {{ferroelectric}} thin films {{have been studied}} at microwave frequencies; lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and barium-strontium titanate (BST) has been widely investigated. However, the microwave dielectric properties of strontium-bismuth tantalate (SBT) {{have not yet been}} investigated so widely [1]. The purpose of this work is the microwave characterization of the dielectric properties of an SBT thin film biased at different DC voltages. The dielectric properties of SBT make it a good material for the production of FERAM memories. Microwave characterizations may show other properties that could promote the SBT as good candidate for capacitors to be employed also in microwave circuits (e. g. resonators and filters). In this work a study of high frequency dielectric properties has been performed and equivalent circuit model has been used to correct the measurements. Experimental Ferroelectric SrBi 2 Ta 2 O 9 (SBT) thin films were deposited onto a platinised substrate using a metal organic decomposition (MOD) preparation technique. <b>Strontium</b> <b>acetate,</b> bismuth ethyl hexanoate and tantalum ethoxide were dissolved in acetic acid.

40|$|International audienceSupercritical fluid {{synthesis}} {{offers an}} attractive and unique method to produce metal oxide nanoparticles such as barium strontium titanate (Ba 1 −xSrxTiO 3 with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1). This synthesis pathway {{has the advantage}} of producing high quality, highly crystalline nanoparticles in a narrow size range, with accurate control of the elemental composition not easily afforded by other methods of production. Coupled with moderate reaction temperatures and short reaction times, this method could be an environmentally preferred synthesis route compared to conventional synthesis pathways. This paper examines the potential environmental impacts leading from the lab-scale supercritical synthesis of 1 kg of Ba 0. 6 Sr 0. 4 TiO 3 nanoparticles of an average size 16 nm using the approach of an anticipatory life-cycle assessment. A cradle-to-gate assessment was completed, estimating the impacts across resource extraction, material processing, and production of the nanoparticles, while excluding any associated use-phase or end-of-life considerations. The life-cycle assessment highlights a number of ways by which the environmental profile of the supercritical synthesis of barium strontium titanate nanoparticles could be improved. Lab-scale synthesis was bound by physical constraints of the reactor, whereby the precursor concentration was kept artificially low. Being able to synthesize nanoparticles with precursor concentrations of 0. 1 and 1. 0 molar would reduce the average life-cycle impacts by nearly 81 % and 95 %, respectively. Additionally, the recovery and reuse of solvents at high recycling rates (e. g. 90 %) could reduce average life-cycle impacts by 56 %. At high precursor concentrations and solvent recycling rates, the environmental performance was further limited by the precursors, namely barium and titanium alkoxides, which have high upstream life-cycle demands (i. e. isopropanol production and metal processing). General impact reductions were seen as the ratio of strontium : barium increased. Further reductions could be achieved by replacing the barium, strontium and titanium alkoxides with precursors having better life-cycle profiles such as barium and <b>strontium</b> <b>acetates</b> or barium and strontium hydroxides...|$|R

Interaction of <b>strontium</b> or barium <b>acetate</b> with dippH 2 in methanol at room temperature leads to the isolation of ionic phosphates [{M- 2 (mu-H 2 O) (4) (H 2 O) (10) }(dipp) (2) ]center dot 4 L [M = Sr, L = CH 3 OH (1); M = Ba, L = H 2 O (2) ]. The addition of a bidentate nitrogen-donor phen to these reactions leads to the isolation of dinuclear metal phosphates [Mg(dipp) (phen) (CH 3 OH) (2) ](2) (3) and [M(dippH) (2) (phen) (2) (H 2 O) ](2) [M = Ca (4), Sr (5), Ba (6) ], While ionic phosphates 1 and 2 are soluble in water, the predominately covalent climeric compounds 3 - 6 are insoluble in all common solvents including water. The new compounds have been characterized in the solid state by elemental analysis, IR, UV-vis, and emission spectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The cationic part in 1 and 2 is a (M- 2 (mu-H 2 O) (4) (H 2 O) (10) unit, where each metal ion is surrounded by four bridging and five terminal water molecules as ligands. The dipp anion does not directly bind to the metal ions but is extensively hydrogen-bonded to the cationic unit through the phosphate oxygen and water hydrogen atoms to result in an infinitely layered structure where the hydrophobic aryl group protrudes out of the hydrophilic layer formed by the cationic part and -PO 32 - units. In contrast, compounds 3 - 6 are discrete climeric molecules built around a central M 2 O 4 P 2 eight-membered ring. While the dippH(2) ligand exists in a doubly deprotonated form in 3, two monodeprotonated dippH(2) ligands are present per metal ion in compounds 4 - 6. While 3 prefers only one phen ligand in the metal coordination sphere, two phen ligands chelate each metal ion in 4 - 6. The conformations of the eight-membered rings in 3 - 6 vary significantly from each other {{depending on the size}} of the cation and the coordination number around the metal. Further, intermolecular hydrogen bonding involving the phenanthroline C-H linkages result, in a gridlike structure in 1, one-dimensional chains in isostructural 2 and 3, and a two-dimensional layer arrangement in 4. Compounds 3 - 6 are the only examples of alkaline-earth metal phosphate complexes with neutral M-N donor bonds. The thermal behavior of compounds 1 - 6 has been examined with the help of thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry and also by bulk thermolysis followed by powder X-ray diffraction measurements. While compounds 1 and 2 yield M 2 P 2 O 7, decomposition of 4 - 6 results in the formation of M(PO 3) (2), consistent with the M-P ratio in the precursor complexes...|$|R
