50|$|Considering {{multiple}} <b>switch</b> <b>access</b> {{is important}} for users accessing more advanced activities through <b>switch</b> <b>access</b> scanning. This is usually determined by their physical capabilities. A single switch requires less physical control and is usually less tiring to access but it reduces scanning options and usually leads to a slower rate of input. Single-switch scanning also requires much greater concentration. Two-switch scanning enables a range of scanning options, including row-and-column and overscan. These can greatly increase input rates and can make using a computer or electronic assistive device far more comfortable and efficient.|$|R
