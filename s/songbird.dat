5|$|The {{position}} of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to European or American robins but {{appear to be an}} early offshoot of the <b>songbird</b> infraorder Passerida. The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird and its prey consists of insects and spiders. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis chapter, which {{discusses}} the auditory asymmetries in <b>songbirds,</b> reviews {{the evidence of}} motor asymmetries {{in the production of}} song, and then evidence of asymmetries in the perception of song. It also analyzes the question of sex differences in song lateralization, showing that while various species of <b>songbirds</b> display asymmetries in song production, the degree and side of lateralization can vary greatly between species. The chapter reveals that multiple and consistent lateralization effects for sensory processing in <b>songbirds</b> echo the lateralization findings for perceptual processing in other taxa, including humans, as well as robust lateralization findings in the vocal and visual system of <b>songbirds</b> in male song behavior. It suggests that studies of the development of hemispheric asymmetries of <b>songbirds</b> are very promising...|$|R
50|$|The most {{extensively}} studied {{model organisms}} of vocal learning {{are found in}} birds, namely <b>songbirds,</b> parrots, and hummingbirds. The degree of vocal learning in each specific species varies. While many parrots and certain <b>songbirds</b> like canaries can imitate and spontaneously combine learned sounds during all periods of their life, other <b>songbirds</b> and hummingbirds are limited to a certain songs learned during their critical period.|$|R
5|$|The white-breasted {{nuthatch}} (Sitta carolinensis) {{is a small}} <b>songbird</b> of the nuthatch family which breeds in old-growth woodland {{across much}} of temperate North America. It is a stocky bird, with a large head, short tail, powerful bill, and strong feet. The upperparts are pale blue-gray, and the face and underparts are white. It has a black cap and a chestnut lower belly. The nine subspecies differ mainly in {{the color of the}} body plumage.|$|E
5|$|The freeway east of Santo Road {{encountered}} delays from environmentalists {{over the}} endangered least Bell's vireo, a <b>songbird</b> which faced habitat destruction, {{as well as}} those concerned with the destruction of homes and businesses for the freeway right-of-way. The extension to Mission Gorge Road opened in 1993, and SR52 was completed to SR125 in 1998. Funding issues delayed the completion of the entire route until 2011, more than fiftyyears after construction began; until then, the city of Santee faced traffic snarls. A widening project was completed in 2007 between Santo Road and Mast Boulevard; further expansion has been put on hold due to state budget concerns.|$|E
5|$|The grey jay (Perisoreus canadensis), also gray jay, Canada jay, or whisky jack, is a {{passerine}} bird of {{the family}} Corvidae. It is found in boreal forests of North America north to the tree line, and in the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone south to New Mexico and Arizona. A fairly large <b>songbird,</b> the grey jay has pale grey underparts, darker grey upperparts, and a grey-white head with a darker grey nape. It {{is one of three}} members of the genus Perisoreus, a small genus more closely related to the Cyanopica genus of magpies than to other birds known as jays. The grey jay itself has nine recognized subspecies.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Songbirds.</b> Passerine {{species may}} be {{observed}} throughout the year. The greatest diversity of <b>songbirds</b> occurs {{in late spring}} and through the summer. Easily observed are the marsh wren, red-winged blackbird and song sparrow.|$|R
50|$|C. arborescens is {{used for}} nesting by several <b>songbirds.</b> The seeds are {{occasionally}} eaten by a few <b>songbirds.</b> The plant is not a preferred food for browsing animals, but its fragrant flowers attract many pollen-consuming animals.|$|R
50|$|Many forest-dwelling <b>songbirds</b> {{breed in}} the Rocky Mountains and winter in Central and South America. Wildlife {{biologists}} suspect that population size {{declines in the}} <b>songbirds</b> may be partly the result of increased predation and brood parasitism. Brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds, for example, increases {{as a result of}} nearby logging. In conifer forests in west-central Idaho, common <b>songbirds</b> benefited from timber harvest, whereas the abundances declined of rare species that inhabit old-growth forests (hermit thrush, Swainson's thrush, and pileated woodpecker).|$|R
5|$|The American robin (Turdus migratorius) is a migratory <b>songbird</b> of the thrush family. It {{is named}} after the European robin because of its reddish-orange breast, though the two species are not closely related, with the European robin {{belonging}} to the Old World flycatcher family. The American robin is widely distributed throughout North America, wintering from southern Canada to central Mexico and along the Pacific Coast. It is the state bird of Connecticut, Michigan, and Wisconsin. According to some sources, the American robin ranks behind only the red-winged blackbird (and {{just ahead of the}} introduced European starling and the not-always-naturally-occurring house finch) as the most abundant extant land bird in North America. It has seven subspecies, but only T. m. confinis of Baja California Sur is particularly distinctive, with pale gray-brown underparts.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parasitic}} trematode {{example is}} seen in a terrestrial setting. Leucochloridium is a genus of flatworm (phylum Platyhelminthes) which matures in the intestine of songbirds. Their eggs pass out of the bird in the feces and are then taken in by Succinea, a terrestrial snail that lives in moist environments. The eggs develop into larvae inside this intermediate host, and then must {{find their way into}} the digestive system of a suitable bird. The problem here is that these birds do not eat snails, so the sporocyst must find some way of manipulating its future host into eating it. Unlike related species, these parasites are brightly colored and able to move in a pulsating manner. A sporocyst sac forces its way into the snail's eye stalks, and pulsates at high speed, enlarging the tentacle in the process. It also affects the host's behavior: the snail moves towards light, which it usually avoids. These combined factors make the sporocysts highly conspicuous, such that they are soon eaten by a hungry <b>songbird.</b> The snail then regenerates its tentacles, and Leucochloridium carries on with its life cycle.|$|E
5|$|Funds {{for the new}} Bonsall bridge were {{approved}} by the California Transportation Commission (CTC) in October1988, and construction was scheduled to begin in early 1989. In November1989, the California Coastal Commission gave the go-ahead for the realignment of SR76 in western Oceanside, from I-5 to Frontier Drive. However, in February1990, the Sierra Club, National Audubon Society, and League for Coastal Protection filed a lawsuit to have the approval overturned, citing concerns over the destruction of habitat. The Bonsall bridge was completed in early 1990, while the old bridge became a National Historic Place. In 1992, the City of Oceanside offered to purchase land as additional habitat for the <b>songbird,</b> {{even though it was}} not a party to the lawsuit. The following year, the City Council voted to use the Lawrence Canyon land for commercial use instead of for the environmental mitigation, thus stalling the project. Following this, the CTC rejected the proposal to build the highway, requiring Caltrans to find another parcel to use for constructing habitat. The CTC did approve the proposal a month later, provided that this land was found before construction began. In October, the City Council decided to use the Lawrence Canyon land for mitigation after all. Nevertheless, a city councilman raised concerns that the expressway would not be adequate to handle 2010 traffic levels.|$|E

5|$|Many birds call Adams home or a {{stopover}} {{on their}} migration routes. Songbirds include three species of chickadee, two kinglets, several thrushes, warblers, sparrows, and finches. One unique <b>songbird</b> {{to the high}} elevations is the gray-crowned rosy finch, who can be found far up the mountain, well above the tree line. Raptors {{that live in the}} forest and meadows include Accipiters, red-tailed hawks, golden and bald eagles, ospreys, great horned owls, and falcons. The many snags around the mountain provide forage and nesting habitat for the many species of woodpeckers that live there including the hairy woodpecker, downy woodpecker, and white-headed woodpecker. Jays such as the Steller's jay and gray jay are common and the gray jay is an especially familiar character, as they will boldly investigate campers and hikers. Another familiar character of the higher elevation forests is the Clark's nutcracker with its distinctive call. Swallows and swifts are frequently seen flying just above the water of lakes and some larger streams. Common mergansers and several other species of water birds can be found on many of the lakes as well. The American dipper with its unique way of bobbing about along streams and then ducking into the water is a common sight. Several grouse species, the sooty, spruce, and ruffed grouse and the white-tailed ptarmigan, call the forests and the lower slopes of the mountain home.|$|E
5|$|Parasites {{can also}} be {{aggressive}} mimics, though the situation is somewhat different from those outlined previously. Some predators have a feature that draws prey; parasites can also mimic their host's natural prey, but are eaten themselves, a pathway into their host. Leucochloridium, a genus of flatworm, matures in the digestive system of songbirds, their eggs then passing out of the bird in the faeces. They are then taken up by Succinea, a terrestrial snail. The eggs develop in this intermediate host, and must then find a suitable bird to mature in. Since the host birds do not eat snails, the sporocyst has another strategy to reach its host's intestine. They are brightly coloured and move in a pulsating fashion. A sporocyst-sac pulsates in the snail's eye stalks, coming to resemble an irresistible meal for a <b>songbird.</b> In this way, it can {{bridge the gap between}} hosts, allowing it to complete its life cycle. A nematode (Myrmeconema neotropicum) changes the colour of the abdomen of workers of the canopy ant Cephalotes atratus to make it appear like the ripe fruits of Hyeronima alchorneoides. It also changes the behaviour of the ant so that the gaster (rear part) is held raised. This presumably increases the chances of the ant being eaten by birds. The droppings of birds are collected by other ants and fed to their brood, thereby helping to spread the nematode.|$|E

Phylogenetic comparisons have suggested that vocal learning evolved among birds at least two or three independent times, in <b>songbirds,</b> parrots, and hummingbirds.

40|$|Humans and oscine <b>songbirds</b> {{share the}} rare {{capacity}} for vocal learning. <b>Songbirds</b> {{have the ability}} to acquire songs and calls of various rhythms through imitation. In several species, birds can even coordinate the timing of their vocalizations with other individuals in duets that are synchronized with millisecond-accuracy. It is not known, however, if <b>songbirds</b> can perceive rhythms holistically nor if they are capable of spontaneous entrainment to complex rhythms, {{in a manner similar to}} humans. Here we review emerging evidence from studies of rhythm generation and vocal coordination across <b>songbirds</b> and humans. In particular, recently developed experimental methods have revealed neural mechanisms underlying the temporal structure of song and have allowed us to test birds’ abilities to predict the timing of rhythmic social signals. Surprisingly, zebra finches can readily learn to anticipate the calls of a vocal robot partner and alter the timing of their answers to avoid jamming, even in reference to complex rhythmic patterns. This capacity resembles, to some extent, human predictive motor response to an external beat. In <b>songbirds,</b> this is driven, at least in part, by the forebrain song system, which controls song timing and is essential for vocal learning. Building upon previous evidence for spontaneous entrainment in human and non-human vocal learners, we propose a comparative framework for future studies aimed at identifying shared mechanism of rhythm production and perception across <b>songbirds</b> and humans...|$|R
