5|$|Duration and {{frequencies}} of the sejms changed over time, with the six-week sejm session convened {{every two years}} being most common. Sejm locations changed throughout history, eventually with the Commonwealth capital of Warsaw emerging as the primary location. The number of sejm deputies and senators grew over time, from about 70 <b>senators</b> <b>and</b> 50 deputies in the 15th century to about 150 <b>senators</b> <b>and</b> 200 deputies in the 18th century. Early sejms have seen mostly majority voting, but beginning in the 17th century, unanimous voting became more common, and 32 sejms were vetoed with the infamous liberum veto, particularly {{in the first half}} of the 18th century. This vetoing procedure has been credited with significantly paralyzing the Commonwealth governance.|$|E

5|$|The 21-team era {{ended in}} 1990, when the league {{revealed}} ambitious plans to double league revenues from $400million {{within a decade}} and bring the NHL to 28franchises during that period. The NHL quickly announced three new teams: The San Jose Sharks, who began play in the 1991–92 season, and the Ottawa <b>Senators</b> <b>and</b> Tampa Bay Lightning, who followed a year later.|$|E
5|$|The core {{allegation}} of the Keating Five affair is that Keating had made contributions of about $1.3 million to various U.S. <b>Senators,</b> <b>and</b> {{he called on}} those Senators to help him resist regulators. The regulators backed off, to later disastrous consequences.|$|E
5|$|The team colours are red, {{black and}} white, like the {{original}} era <b>Senators,</b> <b>and</b> like other Ottawa sports teams (such as the Ottawa Renegades, Rough Riders and 67s), with added trim of gold.

5|$|Activist groups {{interpreted}} {{his comments}} as warnings to President George W. Bush {{about the implications}} of nominating Supreme Court justices who were opposed to the Roe v. Wade decision. Specter maintained that his comments were a prediction, not a warning. He met with many conservative Republican <b>senators,</b> <b>and</b> based on assurances he gave them, he was recommended for the Judiciary Committee's chairmanship in late 2004. He officially assumed that position when the 109th Congress convened on January 4, 2005.|$|E
5|$|After {{his time}} with the Indians ended, Coveleski spent three seasons with the <b>Senators</b> <b>and</b> one with the Yankees before {{retiring}} after the 1928 season.

5|$|During his term, Marshall focused {{primarily}} on advancing the progressive agenda. He successfully advocated {{the passage of a}} child labor law and anti-corruption legislation.

He also overhauled the state auditing agencies and claimed to have saved the government millions of dollars. He was unsuccessful in passing the rest of the progressive platform agenda items or persuading the legislature to call a convention to rewrite the state constitution to expand the government's regulatory powers.|$|E

5|$|In September 1929 Casey was {{assigned}} to the Rivers and Harbors Section of the Office of the Chief of Engineers in Washington, DC. This job involved reviewing the project studies, plans and specifications of all river and harbor projects throughout the United States, including flood control and hydroelectric power projects. He also had responsibility for correspondence with U.S. <b>senators</b> <b>and</b> congressmen. During this time he co-designed and patented the Kingman-Casey Floating Mooring Bit for navigation locks. He was promoted to the substantive rank of captain on 1 May 1933.|$|E
5|$|In {{a meeting}} near Bologna in October 43BC, Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus formed a junta called the Second Triumvirate. This {{explicit}} arrogation of special powers lasting five years was then supported by law {{passed by the}} plebs, unlike the unofficial First Triumvirate formed by Pompey, Julius Caesar, and Marcus Licinius Crassus. The triumvirs then set in motion proscriptions in which 300 <b>senators</b> <b>and</b> 2,000 equites allegedly were branded as outlaws and deprived of their property and, for those who failed to escape, their lives.|$|E
5|$|In early AD 41, Caligula {{was assassinated}} {{as a result}} of a {{conspiracy}} by officers of the Praetorian Guard, <b>senators,</b> <b>and</b> courtiers. The conspirators' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the Roman Republic was thwarted, however. On the day of the assassination of Caligula, the Praetorians declared Caligula's uncle, Claudius the next Roman emperor. Although the Julio-Claudian dynasty continued to rule the empire until the fall of Nero in AD 68, Caligula's death marked the official end of the Julii Caesares in the male line.|$|E

5|$|Indiana's first {{constitution}} was ratified on June 10, 1816, {{and the election}} of the first General Assembly took place on August 5 of that year. They convened in the original three-room statehouse located in Corydon. The body consisted of ten <b>senators</b> <b>and</b> twenty-nine representatives, sixteen of whom had been signers of the Indiana state constitution. There, the General Assembly began its development into the institution it is today. The original constitution provided that representatives served terms of one year and senators served terms of three years, and permitted an annual meeting of the assembly from December until March.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{compares the}} executions of Domitian to those under Emperor Claudius (41–55), noting that Claudius {{executed}} around 35 <b>senators</b> <b>and</b> 300 equestrians, and yet was still deified by the Senate and {{regarded as one}} of the good Emperors of history. Domitian was apparently unable to gain support among the aristocracy, despite attempts to appease hostile factions with consular appointments. His autocratic style of government accentuated the Senate's loss of power, while his policy of treating patricians and even family members as equals to all Romans earned him their contempt.|$|E
5|$|Lucius and {{his army}} were spared, {{due to his}} kinship with Antony, the strongman of the East, while Fulvia was exiled to Sicyon. Octavian showed no mercy, however, for the mass of allies loyal to Lucius; on 15 March, the anniversary of Julius Caesar's assassination, he had 300 Roman <b>senators</b> <b>and</b> equestrians {{executed}} for allying with Lucius. Perusia also was pillaged and burned as a warning for others. This bloody event sullied Octavian's reputation and was criticized by many, such as Augustan poet Sextus Propertius.|$|E
