25|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>cushions</b> {{are often}} less costly than speed humps or tables, and most cities report {{them to be}} just as effective. In some jurisdictions, {{narrower}} <b>speed</b> <b>cushions</b> are placed at more frequent intervals to allow ambulances to pass while driving over the centre line. Large trucks (e.g. UPS, FedEx) are also not slowed down.|$|R
25|$|Wider, American-style {{ambulances}} {{might also}} be able to straddle <b>speed</b> <b>cushions.</b> However, in Europe and Australia, where vehicles like the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter are used most frequently as ambulances, there is no advantage. In these jurisdictions, narrower <b>speed</b> <b>cushions</b> are sometimes placed between lanes to allow ambulances to pass unobstructed while driving over the centre line during an emergency.|$|R
25|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>cushions</b> {{have several}} {{distinct}} advantages over similar traffic calming devices. Many municipalities are challenged by opposition to speed humps and speed tables since they slow down emergency vehicles. <b>Speed</b> <b>cushions</b> {{address this problem}} by allowing larger vehicles to straddle the cushion without slowing down. This is also an advantage for buses, as lower floor vehicles can sometimes ground out on traditional humps.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare speed humps with two newer traffic calming devices that are gaining popularity in the US, the speed slot and <b>speed</b> <b>cushion.</b> Crossing speed and driver behavior were measured at selected traffic calming devices on roadways in the Washington DC metropolitan during the summer of 2003. The subject devices include: • 12 -ft and 22 -ft asphalt speed humps; • 14 -ft prefabricated speed humps; • 22 -ft speed slots; and • 10 -ft speed cushions. All ranged from 2. 5 to 4. 0 inches in height. Video surveillance technology was used to collect data, including vehicle crossing speed, lateral placement and braking frequency. Preliminary results revealed that speed slots allowed the highest average and 85 th percentile crossing speeds. Speed cushions, 12 -ft speed humps and 14 -ft prefabricated speed humps recorded the lowest crossing speed and relatively high frequency of braking maneuvers. The designs of the speed hump and <b>speed</b> <b>cushion</b> encouraged drivers to travel centrally within their lane. Lateral positioning while traversing the speed slot was varied; a large percentage of drivers attempted to place the vehicle’s left tires in the slot...|$|E
25|$|Development of <b>speed</b> <b>cushions</b> {{has focused}} {{primarily}} on the European context. Consumer vehicles in Europe are typically smaller than American vehicles. This is to accommodate smaller demand for passengers and to better suit narrower road widths. European vehicles typically have a narrower track width than American vehicles, meaning their left and right wheels are closer together. Emergency vehicles still feature a wide track width, {{and the difference between}} them makes <b>speed</b> <b>cushions</b> more applicable.|$|R

25|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>cushions</b> are a type {{of speed}} hump {{installation}} designed to alleviate the negative impacts that vertical deflections have on emergency vehicle response times. <b>Speed</b> <b>cushions</b> installations are typically made up of several small speed humps installed across {{the width of the}} road with spaces between them. They force normal cars to slow down as they ride with one or both wheels over the humps. Meanwhile, they allow fire engines (and other large vehicles) with wider axles to straddle the cushions without slowing down.|$|R

25|$|Speed {{tables are}} {{effective}} in calming traffic on streets where the speed limit needs to be maintained rather than slowing cars more significantly. Traffic speed, volumes, and accidents {{have been shown to}} decrease with the use of tables. Although not as responsive to emergency vehicles as <b>speed</b> <b>cushions,</b> <b>speed</b> tables cause less of a delay than humps and are typically preferred by fire departments over speed humps.|$|R

50|$|A radar speed sign is an {{interactive}} sign, generally constructed {{of a series}} of LEDs, that displays vehicle speed as motorists approach. The purpose of radar speed signs is to slow cars down by making drivers aware when they are driving at speeds above the posted limits.

25|$|One {{problematic}} {{aspect of}} speed humps is {{their effect on}} emergency vehicles. Response time is slowed by 35 seconds per hump for fire trucks and fire engines and up to 10 seconds for ambulances with patients on board.

40|$|This conference {{paper was}} {{presented}} at EURONOISE 1998, Munich, Germany [© EURONOISE]: [URL] humps and <b>speed</b> <b>cushions</b> is a simple method of reducing the severity and number of road accidents {{as a result of}} decrease in speeds at which drivers choose to travel However, the experimental investigations carried out by the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) have demonstrated that such a gain is achieved partly in expense of the increased traffic noise and ground-borne vibration (Watts 1997). It has been shown during these investigations that <b>speed</b> control <b>cushions</b> and road humps can produce perceptible levels of ground vibration which depend on vehicle type and hump and cushion design. Theoretical investigations of ground vibrations generated by road traffic have been carried out by several authors. A number of works has been done for vehicles travelling on statistically rough surfaces of rather good quality (Taniguchi et al. 1979, Le Houedec et al 1982, Hunt 1991, Hanazato et al. 1991) and for accelerating and braking vehicles (Krylov 1995 a-c, 1996 a,b). However, vibrations caused by vehicles travelling over single obstacles were analysed only very briefly (Krylov 1995 a,c) and no calculations directly relevant to traffic calming road humps and <b>speed</b> <b>cushions</b> were carried out. In the present paper, ground vibrations generated by vehicles travelling on roads with installed humps of different shapes and sizes are investigated in more detail {{on the basis of the}} earlier developed general approach (Krylov 1995 a,c). The results are compared with the recent experiments carried out by the TRL...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a collection of}} network optimization strategies aimed at aiding the local practitioner in selecting, implementing, and evaluating appropriate strategies to achieve community goals and objectives in the urban environment. The urban environment is often challenging due to the plethora of activity and variety in mode choice. Growing interest in sustainable transportation practices along with encouragement at the Federal, State, and Local levels to is leading to the growing use of non-motorized modes of transportation such as walking and bicycling. The combination of high population density and mixed land use in the urban environment creates unique safety and operational challenges. This research {{presents a}} synthesis of strategies designed to improve local transportation safety and efficiency by targeting speeding and cut-through volumes as improving pedestrian and bicycle facilities in urban areas such as those found in Western Massachusetts. Additionally, this research evaluates two local network optimization strategies; <b>speed</b> <b>cushions</b> and reverse angle parking. The effectiveness of the <b>speed</b> <b>cushions</b> in achieving the community’s goal of reducing speeds was evaluated and determined to be a recommended strategy for future implementation, especially when couple with enforcement. Reverse angle parking, however, was not determined {{to be an effective}} strategy due to the high occurrence of events as well as lower parking volume exhibited during implementation...|$|R

40|$|This papers {{reviews the}} main studies on traffic {{management}} and analyzes the numeric noise results of several current options. It {{was found that}} between <b>speed</b> <b>cushions</b> or humps the noise reduction is about 1 to 2 dB(A) {{but there is an}} increase of 2 to 3 dB(A) (depending on vehicle and hump types) and annoyance (harsh deceleration and acceleration) near the humps. Speed reduction induced by diminution of road width can lead to a noise reduction of 1 to 3 dB(A) especially if it is combined with other traffic management measures. Road noise models usually introduce a penalty up to 3 dB(A) near intersections. The introduction of traffic lights coordination or roundabouts can locally reduce the noise from 1 to 2 dB(A) (free flowing according to interrupted traffic). Speed limitation (from 50 to 30 km/h) induces a noise reduction of 2 to 4 dB(A) for passenger cars and 0 to 2 dB(A) for heavy vehicles (and 2 dBA more for the maximum noise level). Other measures investigated are the selective limitation of the traffic and the low noise driving. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{results from}} studies at five {{different}} intersections in Borås are presented. At two intersections, at Hultagatan and Sjöbotorggatan, the traffic environment was reconstructed using speed reducing devices. The other three were control sites, two at Trandared School with speed reducing devices already implemented {{and one at}} Källbäcksrydsgatan with no speed reducing devices. The sites are studied before and after changes of the traffic environment (if any), before and shortly after the law was changed (1 May 2000). The new law strengthens car drivers {{obligation to give way}} to pedestrians that intend to cross the street at zebra crossings. The studies examine differences between children’s, grownups’ and elderly people’s interactions with motor traffic at zebra crossings. The frequency with which pedestrians are given way to by car drivers increased with 32 percentage points (from 17 % to 49 %) when <b>speed</b> <b>cushions</b> were implemented at Hultagatan. After the new law was enacted the giving way frequency increased to 64 %. The frequency of giving way to pedestrians increased by 9 points (from 59 % to 68 %) and 28 points (from 54 % to 82 %) at the two intersections at Trandared School when the new law was enacted. Elevating the surface at Sjöbotorggatan decreased the speed of the vehicles but had low effect on the giving way frequency because of the pedestrian’s decreased usage of the zebra crossing. No differences between giving way frequency towards children and adults were seen. Godkänd; 2000; 20061102 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of {{traffic calming measures}} on the speed of unimpeded vehicles has been investigated by evaluating differences in speed profiles obtained from various combinations of traffic calming measures. A case study has been conducted in the City of York (UK) focusing on traffic calming measures such as speed humps (flat-topped and round topped), <b>speed</b> <b>cushions</b> and chicanes implemented in sequence. Vehicles' passing times were simultaneously recorded at 16 points along each traffic calmed link. From these data a speed profile for each individual vehicle could be derived. An empirical model was developed using multiple regression analysis techniques based on data collected at three calibration sites. Speeds along these links were described {{as a function of}} the input speed, the type of measure and the distance between measures. The speed profile model was shown to be a good representation for the data from the calibration sites. It efficiently predicted speeds of unimpeded vehicles over a given combination of traffic calming measures in sequence. The validation process, based on data collected at three validation sites, also indicated that the model provided a good representation of the observed profiles at these sites, with the exception of the prediction of the effects of the chicanes on speeds. This type of measure was shown to produce diverse impacts on speeds which depended on the detailed design. While the model is a useful design tool, recommendations have been made for further enhancement to it. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPedestrian {{fatality}} rate in Poland of 30 deaths per year per million population {{was the second}} highest among the EU countries in 2013. In the years 2007 - 2013 some 13 % of pedestrian fatalities and 26 % of injuries occurred at unsignalized pedestrian crossings where pedestrians should theoretically be safe. The paper presents results of research project MOBIS which was aimed to develop surrogate safety measures based on detection of dangerous situations or near-accidents. Within the project, pedestrian and vehicle traffic was recorded at four pedestrian crossings in Warsaw and Wrocław, {{for a period of}} approximately 2 months per crossing. Motion trajectories of vehicles and pedestrians were determined and certain parameters describing the pedestrian-vehicle encounters calculated. The average number of such encounters was over 1000 per day in both Warsaw and Wrocław. Dedicated video and data analysis algorithms were used to extract interactions that met certain criteria. To this end the following parameters were used: velocity profiles of pedestrians and vehicles, minimum distance between the participants, deceleration during braking, etc. These variables were used to develop surrogate safety indicators for pedestrian-vehicle encounters. A classification of encounters based on the characteristics of pedestrian-vehicle interaction is also proposed. Within the project certain solutions for increasing pedestrian safety at road crossings were installed and evaluated. These included <b>speed</b> <b>cushions</b> and flashing lights warning the drivers about pedestrian presence that were either mounted on traffic poles or embedded in the road surface. The evaluation of these solutions will be based on surrogate safety measures developed in the MOBIS project...|$|R
25|$|A speed table (or {{flat top}} hump or raised {{pedestrian}} crossing) is {{designed as a}} long speed hump with a flat section in the middle. Speed tables are generally {{long enough for the}} entire wheelbase of a passenger car to rest on top.

40|$|This Thesis {{describes}} {{a study of}} the impacts of traffic calming on exhaust emissions, the most detailed and extensive of its kind to date. The main objectives of the work were to measure the effects of different types of traffic calming measure on vehicle emissions, to develop a system of comparative performance indicators and guidance for local authorities, and to assess and improve the performance of an existing micro-scale emission model in traffic calming applications. There were several elements to the research which have not previously been reported, including the development of driving cycles for traffic calming based on external speed measurements and the use of remote sensing to assess the impacts of traffic calming on emissions in situ. Nine different types of measure were investigated, including a mixture of vertical deflections (e. g. road humps, <b>speed</b> <b>cushions)</b> and horizontal deflections (e. g. chicanes). Driving cycles were formulated to represent vehicle operation before and after the introduction of the schemes, based on traffic speeds measured using both an instrumented car and an external method (LIDAR). Fuel consumption and emissions of CO, HC, NOx, and C 02 from a total of 22 cars (including petrol non-catalyst, petrol catalyst, and diesel vehicles) were measured on a chassis dynamometer using the cycles. Emissions of total particulate matter were also recorded from the diesel vehicles. The results from the laboratory emission tests were used to compare the performance of an 'average speed' emission model (MEET) and a 'modal' emission model (MODEM). Also, an attempt was made to improve the accuracy of MODEM model in such applications by developing a variant model (MODEM-TC) for use in traffic calming applications. In MODEM-TC the original MODEM emission matrices were replaced with ones derived from the laboratory test results. The emission tests indicated that traffic calming increases exhaust emissions. For the three types of car tested, emissions of CO, HC, and C 02 increased by between 20...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to improve the understanding of drivers’ behaviour while negotiating traffic calming measures, through the study of the impacts of these measures on speeds. A case study was conducted in the City of York focusing on speed humps (flat-topped and round-topped), <b>speed</b> <b>cushions</b> and chicanes implemented in sequence. Data collection was conducted at three calibration and three validation sites with vehicles’ passing times simultaneously recorded at 16 points along the links. From these data a speed profile for each individual vehicle could be derived. The influence of various combinations of traffic calming measures on speeds of unimpeded cars and vans was evaluated through those speed profiles, and through acceleration profiles deduced from speed profiles. The investigation of the hypotheses established from the analyses of speed and acceleration profiles gave insights into specific issues such as the consistency of crossing speeds, the additive effect of subsequent measures, the acceleration and deceleration rates associated with individual measures and travel times along calmed links. The knowledge acquired from these analyses was applied to the formulation of a speed profile model. To describe drivers’ behaviour along traffic calmed links an empirical model was developed using multiple regression analysis techniques based on data collected at the calibration sites. Speeds along calmed links were described {{as a function of the}} input speed, the type of measure and the distance between measures.

40|$|The {{question}} of ground influence on airplanes has recently attracted some attention {{in view of}} the claims made by certain designers that the landing speed of their airplanes is much decreased by an increase in lift coefficient due to the proximity of the ground in landing. The results of wind tunnel tests indicate that ground effect is not entirely beneficial. It decreases the landing <b>speed</b> and <b>cushions</b> the landing shock somewhat. However, it does so at the expense of an increased length of preliminary skimming over the ground. By decreasing the drag and increasing the lift, it lengthens the distance necessary for the airplane to travel before losing enough speed to land. On the other hand, its influence is helpful in taking off, {{especially in the case of}} flying boats with their low-lying wings. In the conventional tractor airplane, the height of the wings above the ground is determined largely by propeller clearance. However, a small low-speed airplane like the Pischoff and large low-speed commercial aircraft with engines between wings can utilize ground influence to good advantage...|$|R

It was found that, when judged in absolute terms, all types of speed management scheme have remarkably similar effects on accidents, with an average fall in personal injury accidents of about 1 accident/km/year.
