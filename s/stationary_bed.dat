During the 17th century this curious custom became general, perhaps to avoid the tiresome details of etiquette. Portable beds were used in high society in France till the end of the Ancien Régime.

Results are presented of our recent experiments with two fractions of ballotini in a 100 -mm-pipe loop. Experimental work contained measurements of concentration profiles and velocity profiles.

40|$|Adsorption is the {{attraction}} of gas molecules {{to the surface of}} an activated solid. There are two classifications of adsorption: physical and chemical. At ordinary temperatures, adsorption is usually caused by molecular forces rather than by the formation of chemical bonds. In this type of adsorption, called physical adsorption, very little heat is evolved. If a chemical reaction takes place between the gas and the solid surface, the process is known as chemisorption. In chemisorption the reaction between surface and gas molecules occurs in a stoichiometric manner, and heat is liberated during the reaction. Chemisorption is used in the removal of UF 6 and HF from gaseous effluent streams. It is also used to remove oil mist from vacuum pumps operating upstream of gaseous effluent ventilation systems. Adsorbent materials are placed on <b>stationary</b> <b>beds</b> in chemical traps downstream of the various cold traps. These materials capture HF and the trace amounts of UF 6 that escape desublimation during feed purification or during venting of residual UF 6 contained in hoses and/or piping that is bled down before disconnection.

40|$|An {{effective}} drilled cuttings lifting {{from the}} bottom hole to the surface improves drilling performance. The transportation of drilled cuttings becomes more challenging when drilling a high angle or horizontal well. A sufficiently high annular mud velocity is essential to prevent drilled cuttings from settling and forming <b>stationary</b> <b>beds</b> on the low side of a hole. This can cause several drilling problems such as high torque and drag, stuck pipe, etc. This problem has been addressed via an experimental work which studied the effect of annular mud velocities on drilled cuttings removal using water-based mud with polypropylene beads in vertical, deviated, and horizontal holes. It was accomplished using a 3. 96 m long flow loop which comprised 50. 8 mm transparent acrylic section with a simulated drill string. The annular mud velocity was varied from 0. 27 in/s to 1. 06 m/s at ambient condition. The experimental results showed that increase in annular mud velocity has improved hole cleaning, i. e., cuttings transport ratio experienced an improved performance in the turbulent flow than in laminar flow. The findings further demonstrated {{that the presence of}} polypropylene beads in water-based mud has contributed positively to the performance of drilled cuttings lifting in a vertical hole by 9 % in a turbulent flow...|$|R
30|$|One of {{the main}} {{concerns}} in solid transport is pipeline plugging. Plugging {{is not only a}} safety threat but also a financial one. Plugging can lead to frequent shutdowns, equipment damage and even explosions. Deposition velocity determination is one of the design philosophies that can be employed to evaluate plugging potential. Deposition velocity is the velocity below which particles begin to deposit forming moving or <b>stationary</b> <b>beds</b> {{at the bottom of the}} pipe (Poloski et al. 2009 a, b; Yokuda et al. 2009; Turian et al. 1987; Peysson 2004; Doron and Barnea 1996; Ibarra et al. 2014). This causes the flow to become unstable, and the pipe will eventually clog. Partial pipeline blockages may lead to erosion, corrosion and local velocity increase (Najmi et al. 2015). Plugging results from transporting slurries at velocities lower than the deposition velocity (Ibarra et al. 2014; Najmi et al. 2015; Salama 2000; King et al. 2001; McLaury et al. 2011; Al-lababidi et al. 2012). Most deposition models and experimental investigation in open literature focus on Newtonian carrier fluids. The goal of this work is to extend deposition velocity modeling to non-Newtonian fluids. Since deposition velocity is associated with flow regime changes, a flow regime map will be developed in this work. Finally, a predictive method is developed for the deposition velocity and flow regimes.|$|R
