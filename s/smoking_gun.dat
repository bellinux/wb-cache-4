Sometimes the <b>smoking</b> <b>gun</b> is discovered by a fortunate accident during other research. For example, the discovery by Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez of an iridium-rich layer at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary made asteroid impact and volcanism the most favored explanations for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.|$|E

25|$|Grand jury {{proceedings}} (without {{defense counsel}} {{and without a}} judge present) in Santa Barbara, starting in March 2004, led to Jackson's indictment on April 21, 2004. The grand jury had nineteen jurors; the indictment required the votes of at least twelve jurors. Prosecution witnesses testified without defense cross-examination. The judge ruled that witnesses {{before the grand jury}} could talk to defense attorneys about their knowledge of the case as long as the witnesses did not tell what they saw in the grand jury room or what questions they were asked and their answers. Many grand jury witnesses were sneaked into the building where the grand jury was meeting, sometimes covered in blankets to hide their identities.

25|$|As president, Zardari {{called for}} a United Nations {{investigation}} into his wife's assassination. In 2009, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon established a three-person team to lead the investigation comprising the Chilean Heraldo Muñoz, Irish Peter FitzGerald, and Indonesian Marzuki Darusman. Although {{it was not in}} the commission's remit to identify a culprit, Muñoz later expressed the view that the assassination was likely carried out by the Pakistani Taliban, perhaps with the support of Mehsud, and that they may well have been assisted by rogue elements in the country's intelligence agencies. He also expressed the view that the original police investigation had been deliberately botched. In February 2012, the Pakistani official enquiry issued its final report, placing responsibility for the attack with 27 different militant groups. In May 2013, the state's main prosecutor in the Bhutto case, Zulfikar Ali, was himself assassinated in Islamabad. There was never a <b>smoking</b> <b>gun</b> in the Bhutto investigation.|$|E

500|$|Finkelstein noted 20 instances, {{in as many}} pages, where Dershowitz's book {{cites the}} same sources and {{passages}} used by Joan Peters in her book, in largely the same sequence, with ellipses in the same places. In two instances, Dershowitz reproduces Peters's errors (see below). From this Finkelstein concluded that Dershowitz had not checked the original sources himself, contrary to the latter's claims. Finkelstein suggests that this copying of quotations amounts to copying ideas. Examining {{a copy of a}} proof of Dershowitz's book he managed to obtain, he found evidence that Dershowitz had his secretarial assistant, Holly Beth Billington, check in the Harvard library the sources he had read in Peters's book. Dershowitz answered the charge {{in a letter to the}} University of California's Press Director Lynne Withey, arguing that Finkelstein had made up the <b>smoking</b> <b>gun</b> quotation, in that he had changed its wording (from 'cite' to 'copy') in his book.

[...] Forensic Biologist Nathan Lents of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the report's results are consistent with a possible polonium poisoning, but [...] "There's certainly not a <b>smoking</b> <b>gun</b> here."

500|$|American Life is Madonna's {{second album}} {{to bear a}} [...] "Parental Advisory" [...] label after Erotica (1992), due the profanity used in the title song.

To counter illegal downloads of the album's songs {{before and after the}} release, Madonna's associates created a number of false MP3 files of similar length and size. Some of these files delivered a brief message from Madonna saying [...] "What the fuck do you think you're doing?" [...] followed by minutes of silence.

[...] followed by download links for each of the album's songs. The Madonna.com website was closed after the attack for about 15hours. Liz Rosenberg, Madonna's spokesperson, told The <b>Smoking</b> <b>Gun</b> that the defacement was indeed a hack, and not a marketing ploy. The defacement was linked to Phrack, an online hacker magazine whose representatives clarified that they did not [...] "have [...] link with this [...] guy in any way, and we don't even know his identity." [...] The hacked page also contained a derogatory reference to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the federal law aimed at cracking down on digital and online piracy.
