Aris' visit in Christmas 1995 {{turned out to be}} the last time that he and <b>Suu</b> <b>Kyi</b> met, as <b>Suu</b> <b>Kyi</b> remained in Burma and the Burmese dictatorship denied him any further entry visas. Aris was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 which was later found to be terminal. Despite appeals from prominent figures and organizations, including the United States, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and Pope John Paul II, the Burmese government would not grant Aris a visa, saying that they did not have the facilities to care for him, and instead urged Aung San <b>Suu</b> <b>Kyi</b> to leave the country to visit him. She was at that time temporarily free from house arrest but was unwilling to depart, fearing that she would be refused re-entry if she left, as she did not trust the military junta's assurance that she could return.|$|E
