The NRF collects and manages data on all professor–researchers who receive funds, including the number of graduate students involved in research.

5000|$|The second {{route to}} obtaining an {{accredited}} master's degree begins in graduate school, with a 3 or 3.5 year master's degree (commonly called an [...] "M.Arch. I"). The advantage to this route {{is that the}} student can study something else {{he or she is}} interested in his/her undergraduate study (anything else). Because students come from different undergraduate backgrounds, the breadth of knowledge and experience in the student body of an M.Arch. I program is often considered an advantage. One possible disadvantage is that the total time in school is longer (7 or 7.5 years with an undergraduate degree). Another disadvantage is that the student has a very <b>short</b> <b>time</b> to <b>cover</b> the extremely broad scope of subject areas of which architects are expected to have a working knowledge. Nevertheless, major schools of architecture including MIT and Harvard often offer 3.5 year program to students already with strong architectural background, fostering a competitive and productive academic environment.|$|R

40|$|Objectives Health human {{resource}} planning has traditionally been based on simple models of demographic changes applied to observed levels of service utilization or provider supply. No consideration {{has been given to}} the implications of changing levels of need within populations over time. Recently, needs based resource planning models have been suggested that incorporate changes in needs for care explicitly as a determinant of health care needs. Methods In this paper, population indicators of morbidity, mortality and self-assessed health are analyzed to determine if health care needs have changed across birth cohorts in Canada from 1994 to 2005 among older age groups. Multivariate regression analysis was used to estimate the age pattern of health by birth year with interaction terms included to examine whether the association of age with health was conditional on the birth year. Results Results indicate that while the probability of mortality, mobility problems and pain rises with age, the rate of change is greater for those born earlier. The probability of self-assessed poor health increases with age but the rate of change with age is constant across birth years. Conclusions Even in the <b>short</b> <b>time</b> period <b>covered,</b> our analysis shows that health care needs by age are changing over time in Canada.

30|$|A dummy {{variable}} designed {{to reflect the}} impact of the 7 / 7 London bombings in 2005 is constructed and takes a value of one if the year is post- 2005 and zero otherwise. This variable is discussed in greater detail in the next section. A number of other variables are also used at the second-stage of our econometric analysis and these are best interpreted as either time invariant or moving glacially over time. For instance, time-invariant variables for whether the developing country shares a common official language with the UK and the geographical distance between London and the 89 capital cities are used. The proportion of the country’s population that is Muslim is included to determine the relationship between Muslim countries and the international demand for UK educational services. The realisations for this particular variable are likely to change imperceptibly over the <b>short</b> period of <b>time</b> <b>covered</b> by this study and its approximate treatment here as time-invariant appears fairly innocuous.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: With today's {{electric}} charging technology, {{charging time}} {{of an electric}} vehicle (EV) is much longer than that for a gasoline vehicle, and therefore the queueing effect at an EV charging station (CS) may be serious. That is, when an EV arrives at an overloaded CS, {{it is likely that}} the EV will wait for a long time before it is charged. This paper investigates the waiting problem for EV charging. We propose a Mobile CS (MCS) management system to dynamically distribute charging pole support that reduces the waiting times of EVs incurred in a fixed CS. A Mobile Charging Information Management System (MC-IMS) is presented to describe the execution flow of the MCS service. Simulation experiments are conducted to investigate the waiting time performance for the proposed mechanism. Our study indicates that the MCS-based MC-IMS provides effective EV charging with <b>short</b> waiting <b>times.</b> <b>Cover</b> Letter Dear Editor, We would like to submit the manuscript entitled "Mobile Charging Information Management for Smart Grid Networks " for the IJIM special section invitation from Prof. Ilsun You, and we wish to be considered for publication in International Journal of Information Management.

40|$|High-latitude {{conditions}} in northern Europe are characterised by short growing seasons (May-August) and long dormant seasons. Alternating mild and freezing conditions lead to variable snow accumulation-melt cycles affecting runoff generation, and consequently {{the loss of}} nutrients and sediments from agricultural fields. We assessed water balance in two subsurface drained clayey agricultural fields of different slopes (1 % and 5 %) in southern Finland to discern changes between mild and cold winters. The water balances of the two field sections were produced with a spatially distributed 3 D hydrological model. Simulated snow water equivalent (SWE), drain discharge, tillage layer runoff and groundwater outflow from a 7 -year period were examined during the dormant seasons (September-April) {{in relation to the}} North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, which characterises phases related to mild and cold winters in northern Europe. Mild periods (positive NAO) were associated with more frequent runoff events, which were sustained throughout mild winters with lower SWE and <b>shorter</b> <b>time</b> of snow <b>cover.</b> Understanding and quantifying the water balance through periods of different weather patterns is essential as climate change is projected to increase the occurrence of positive NAO phases challenging the control of nutrient and sediment losses from agricultural fields...|$|R

This is a schedule for each car's planned pit stops during the race, and takes into account factors such as rate of fuel consumption, weight of fuel, cornering speed with each available tyre compound, rate of tyre wear, the effect of tyre wear on cornering speed, the length of pit road and the track's pit road speed limit, and even expected changes in weather and lighting conditions. The pit strategy does not just include a schedule of when pit stops will happen; it also includes what service and adjustments are scheduled for each pit stop, particularly in endurance racing, where scheduled changes of wear-limited parts such as brake pads may be planned for specific points during the race. The pit strategy is calculated carefully so that the amount of time to be [...] "given away" [...] to other competitors in pit stops is balanced out by the time gained while on the track, resulting, theoretically, in the <b>shortest</b> possible <b>time</b> to <b>cover</b> the scheduled distance.|$|R

40|$|Sub-national {{trends in}} {{fertility}} are {{of great importance}} for policy makers and regional planners. This paper aims to provide a theoretical and empirical framework for policy makers, taking into account past and present trends in fertility, {{as well as their}} theoretical underpinnings. These will, we argue, be crucial in determining future trajectories and potential political responses to them. The theoretical part of the paper deals with the factors that may influence fertility differences at the sub-national level, including decisions and life course trajectories at the individual level, as well as contextual socio-economic phenomena operating at different geographical levels (local, regional, national, global). This is followed by an empirical section, which takes the Eurostat publications on spatial fertility differences in Europe as a starting point. In an attempt to overcome the limitations of these reports – both in terms of the lack of geographic detail and the <b>short</b> <b>time</b> span <b>covered</b> – we provide more thorough overviews for Austria, Germany and Switzerland. Using historical data from the Princeton European Fertility Project and other sources, {{we have been able to}} reconstruct comparative regional fertility time series for the past 150 years. Finally, we present a case study on local fertility development in the municipalities and unified rural communities of the German state of Lower Saxony and the districts of the German city of Bremen. Based on the results of this analysis, we conclude that the recent degree of fertility convergence between regions within countries – particularly at the macro-regional level – is, indeed, striking. However, taking a long-term perspective, we are able to identify some substantial time periods over the last 150 years in which regional fertility levels diverged. This implies that the current picture must not necessarily constitute Fukuyama’s “end of history” over the coming decades. Moreover, the study of local-level data reveals that, in contrast to the overall macro-regional fertility convergence process in all three countries, a trend towards divergence can be observed within the city of Bremen. This demonstrates that local divergence can run parallel to overall regional convergence...|$|R
