5|$|Kawada's musical style mainly fuses {{rock with}} trance. When Kawada debuted in 2001, she {{originally}} {{felt that the}} music she earned in her career was pocket money. She also felt happy that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> based in Sapporo where <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> close to her family and friends, {{as well as to}} I've Sound who she felt was like a second family to her. After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. At first, she was hesitant because she felt that she would be thrust into the spotlight, but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she always felt that she was a beginner, but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|E

5|$|Roanoke, {{named after}} the Roanoke River, was laid down at the Norfolk Navy Yard in May 1854 and {{launched}} on 13 December 1855. The ship sank when launched {{and had to be}} refloated before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> completed. She was commissioned on 4 May 1857 with Captain John B. Montgomery in command.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, Shabazz was {{overseeing}} the health sciences department, {{and the college}} president decided <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> more effective in a purely administrative position than {{she was in the}} classroom. She was promoted to Director of Institutional Advancement. In her new position, she became a booster and fund-raiser for the college. A year later, she was given tenure. In 1984, Shabazz was given a new title, Director of Institutional Advancement and Public Affairs; she held that position at the college until her death.|$|E

5|$|Governor David Paterson's {{selection}} process {{began with a}} number of prominent names and high-ranking New York Democrats, including Andrew Cuomo, Fran Drescher and Caroline Kennedy, vying for the spot. Gillibrand quietly campaigned for the position, meeting secretly with Paterson on at least one occasion. She said that she made an effort to underscore her successful House elections in a largely conservative district, adding that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a good complement to Chuck Schumer. Gillibrand was presumed a likely choice {{in the days before the}} official announcement. On January 23, 2009, Paterson held a press conference to announce Gillibrand as his choice.|$|E
5|$|On 6March 1429 Joan of Arc {{arrived at}} Château de Chinon. She claimed to hear heavenly voices that said Charles would grant her an army {{to relieve the}} siege of Orléans. While staying at the castle she resided in the Tour du Coudray. Charles met with her two days after her arrival and then sent her to Poitiers so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> cross-examined to ensure she was telling the truth. Joan {{returned}} to Chinon in April where Charles granted her supplies and sent her to join the army at Orléans.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Wales {{was forced}} to {{disengage}} {{by a combination of}} damage from German hits and mechanical failures in her guns and turrets after Hood was sunk. Despite these problems, she had hit Bismarck three times. One of these hits contaminated {{a good portion of the}} ship's fuel supply and subsequently caused her to steer for safety in occupied France where <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> repaired. Bismarck was temporarily able to evade detection, but was later spotted and sunk by the British on 27 May.|$|E

5|$|She {{remained}} laid up {{for some}} time, before being put to varied use around England, Scotland and Ireland. In November 1846, Isambard Kingdom Brunel's iron ship SS Great Britain ran aground on the sands of Dundrum Bay, Ireland. There was doubt as to whether <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> re-floated. Brunel advised that if anyone could rescue the ship then the man to do it was the naval engineer James Bremner. He was engaged and the Great Britain was re-floated on 27 August 1847 {{with the assistance of}} HMS Birkenhead.|$|E
5|$|Despite being decommissioned, {{repair work}} on the ship continued. The ship was moved in April to Pillau in the Baltic, to put Admiral Hipper {{out of the reach}} of Allied bombers. A year later, the ship was moved to Gotenhafen; the Kriegsmarine {{intended}} to re-commission the ship so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used in the Baltic. Over the next five months, Admiral Hipper ran a series of sea trials in the Baltic, but failed to reach operational status. As the Soviet army pushed the Germans back on the Eastern Front, her crew was drafted into construction {{work on the}} defenses of the city, further impairing Admiral Hippers ability to enter active service. The Royal Air Force also laid an extensive minefield around the port, which forced the ship to remain in the harbor.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, Casson's uncle, Isambard Owen, {{vice-chancellor}} at University of Bristol, {{promised her}} a place studying medicine if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> formally matriculated to the university. She struggled with her Latin exams for two years, but eventually passed them and registered to study medicine on 1 October 1913 {{at the age}} of 32. She graduated with her Bachelor of Medicine degree in 1919, and took on a role at the West Hertfordshire Hospital in Hemel Hempstead. There she noticed that patients in the women's wards were enjoying using artistic talents, and decided that such pursuits were important to treatment. She realised that these pursuits were not only keeping the patients occupied but also helping them gain self-esteem and work through their issues.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, Coffin {{fell ill}} {{with a serious}} hip {{infection}} that forced her to curtail much of her physical activity and required a lengthy stay in hospital. She moved to a newly acquired house in New Haven, Connecticut, although she continued to maintain her office in New York and commuted there daily. Coffin often entertained guests in New Haven (and recruited several Connecticut notables as new clients), holding teas, cocktail parties, musical events and buffet suppers. The garden, which she had laid out herself, became the site of garden parties in the summer months. She preferred the company of young architects, artists, musicians and writers, though <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> curt towards those she took a dislike to; on one occasion, she snubbed Hilaire Belloc when he asked her which of his books she had read.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Hepburn filmed The African Queen, {{her first}} movie in Technicolor. She played Rose Sayer, a prim {{spinster}} missionary living in German East Africa at {{the outbreak of}} World War I. Costarring Humphrey Bogart, The African Queen was shot mostly on location in the Belgian Congo, an opportunity Hepburn embraced. It proved a difficult experience, however, and Hepburn became ill with dysentery during filming. Later in life, she released a memoir about the experience. The movie was released {{at the end of}} 1951 to popular support and critical acclaim, and gave Hepburn her fifth Best Actress nomination at the Academy Awards. The first successful film she had made without Tracy since The Philadelphia Story a decade earlier, it proved that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a hit without him and fully reestablished her popularity.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} when Taft met Helen Herron (often called Nellie), {{but it was no}} later than 1880, when she {{mentioned}} in her diary receiving an invitation to a party from him. By 1884, they were meeting regularly, and in 1885, after an initial rejection, she agreed to marry him. The wedding took place at the Herron home on June 19, 1886. William Taft remained devoted to his wife throughout their almost 44 years of marriage. Nellie Taft pushed her husband much as his parents had, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> very frank with her criticisms. The couple had three children, of which the eldest, Robert, became a U.S. senator.|$|E

5|$|Joaquim Inácio {{returned}} to Rio de Janeiro in October, his {{tour of duty}} having lasted three years. He was then sent back to Cisplatina aboard the frigate Niterói and in December {{he became the first}} officer of the barque Grenfell. On 17 February 1828, he fought in the Battle of Quilmes. During the engagement, the Brazilian barque-brig (three-masted barque) Vinte e nove de agosto ran aground and was about to be boarded. Seeing this, Joaquim Inácio positioned the Grenfell near the threatened vessel and protected her until <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> freed by the rising tide. Both ships {{returned to}} the battle, which resulted in a Brazilian victory. Brazil's efforts in the war were ultimately in vain, as it eventually relinquished Cisplatina, which became the independent nation of Uruguay. In July 1829, Joaquim Inácio again returned to Rio de Janeiro, and on 17 October he was promoted to first lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|Karlsruhe sank at 15:50; {{the rights}} to {{salvaging}} the ship were sold in 1962. She has not been raised for scrapping, however. Emden was boarded by British sailors who beached her before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> completely sunk. After being refloated, she was ceded to France and used as a test ship for explosives before being broken up in 1926. Nürnberg was also beached by British sailors. She was eventually sunk off the Isle of Wight as a gunnery target. Königsberg was meanwhile stricken from the naval register on 20 July 1920 and ceded to France. She was renamed Metz and served with the French Navy until 1933. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{told the}} court that, during her {{interaction}} with WikiLeaks on IRC and Jabber, she developed a friendship with someone there, believed to be Julian Assange (although neither knew the other's name), which she said made her feel <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> herself. Army investigators found 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on her MacBook's hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Assange. She wrote {{in a statement that}} the more she had tried to fit in at work, the more alienated she became from everyone around her. The relationship with WikiLeaks had given her a brief respite from the isolation and anxiety.|$|E
