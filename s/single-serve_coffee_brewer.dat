40|$|Phthalate {{plasticizers}} {{and heavy}} metals are widely recognized to be pollutants {{that interfere with}} key developmental processes such as masculinization. We investigated the release of phthalates and heavy metals in coffee brewed from <b>coffee</b> packed in <b>single-serve</b> <b>coffee</b> containers made from different types of materials: metal, biodegradable and plastics. We detected with GCâMS small amounts phthalates, below the tolerated daily risks levels, in all the coffees prepared from {{the different types of}} capsules. Specifically, Di (2 -ethyl-hexyl) -phthalate and DiBP: Diisobuthyl-pthalate were ubiquitously present despite the high variability among the samples (respective range 0. 16 â 1. 87 Â Î¼g/mL and 0. 01 â 0. 36 Â Î¼g/mL). Whereas, diethyl-phthalate (range 0. 20 â 0. 26 Â Î¼g/mL) and di-n-buthyl-phthalate (range 0. 02 â 0. 14 Â Î¼g/mL) were detected respectively in one and three out of the four types of capsule tested. In contrast, we detected by atomic mass spectrometry on mineralized samples heavy metals lead (Pb) and nickel (Ni), in all coffee tested. PB levels (respective range 0. 32 â 211. 57 Â Î¼g/dose) accounted for 42 â 79 %, whereas Ni levels (respective range 166. 25 â 1950. 26 Â Î¼g/dose) accounted for > 100 % of the tolerable daily intake.

50|$|Bunn-O-Matic {{also came}} out with a {{different}} drip-brew machine. In this type of coffeemaker, the machine uses a holding tank or boiler pre-filled with water. When the machine is turned on, all of the water in the holding tank is brought to near boiling point (approximately 200207 °F or 9397 °C) using a thermostatically-controlled heating element. When water is poured into a top-mounted tray, it descends into a funnel and tube which delivers the cold water {{to the bottom of the}} boiler. The less-dense hot water in the boiler is displaced out of the tank and into a tube leading to the spray head, where it drips into a brew basket containing the ground coffee. The pourover, water displacement method of coffeemaking tends to produce brewed coffee at a much faster rate than standard drip designs. Its primary disadvantage is increased electricity consumption in order to preheat the water in the boiler. Additionally, the water displacement method is most efficient when used to brew coffee at the machine's maximum or near-maximum capacity, as typically found in restaurant or office usage. In 1963, Bunn introduced the first automatic <b>coffee</b> <b>brewer,</b> which connected to a waterline for an automatic water feed.|$|R
5000|$|Angelo Moriondo's Italian {{patent for}} a steam-driven [...] "instantaneous" [...] coffee {{beverage}} making device, which was registered in Turin in 1884 (No. 33/256), is notable. Author Ian Bersten, whose history of <b>coffee</b> <b>brewers</b> is cited below, {{claims to have}} been the first to discover Moriondo's patent. Bersten describes the device as [...] "almost certainly the first Italian bar machine that controlled the supply of steam and water separately through the coffee" [...] and Moriondo as [...] "certainly one of the earliest discoverers of the expresso [...] machine, if not the earliest." [...] Unlike true espresso machines, it was a bulk brewer, and did not brew coffee for the individual customer. Seventeen years later, in 1901, Luigi Bezzera, from Milan, came up with a number of improvements to the espresso machine. He patented a number of these, the first of which was applied for on the 19th of December 1901. It was titled [...] "Innovations in the machinery to prepare and immediately serve coffee beverage" [...] (Patent No. 153/94, 61707, granted on the 5 June 1902). In 1905, the patent was bought by Desiderio Pavoni, who founded the La Pavoni company and began to produce the machine industrially (one a day) in a small workshop in Via Parini in Milan.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Recently, both {{small and}} large {{commercial}} <b>coffee</b> <b>brewers</b> have begun offering cold-brew coffee drinks to customers with the claims that these cold-water extracts contain fewer bitter acids due to brewing conditions (Toddy website, 2016) while still retaining the flavor profile. Dunkin Donuts’ website suggests that the cold-water and long brewing times allow the coffee to reach “ [...] . its purest form. ” With very little research existent on the chemistry of cold brew coffee consumers are left to the marketing strategies of Starbucks and other companies regarding the contents of cold-brew coffee. This research analyzes the caffeine and chlorogenic acid (3 -CGA) content of cold-brew coffee {{as a function of}} brewing time, grind size, and roasting temperature of coffee beans sourced from the Kona region of Hawaii using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Coarse and medium grinds of both dark and medium roasts were analyzed by mixing 350 mL of filtered water with 35 g of coffee grinds under constant stirring at 20 °C. Sampling was performed every 15 minutes for the first hour, then every 30 minutes for the next ten to twelve hours, with a final sample being drawn at 24 hours. Equilibrium concentrations for both 3 -CGA and caffeine were reached following 600 minutes. The caffeine concentrations ranged from 935 mg/L to 1475 mg/L. Variation was seen as a function of roasting temperature, and less so grind size. The 3 -CGA concentrations were found to range from 345 mg/L to 547 mg/L. In both cases, the medium roast coarse grind coffee produced the highest concentrations of caffeine and 3 -CGA while dark roast coarse grind produced the lowest concentrations of caffeine and 3 -CGA. Hot brew experiments agreed well with caffeine and 3 -CGA extraction concentrations in both dark roast coffees, showing very similar final concentrations. The medium roast coffees showed deviation from the hot brew coffees with respect to caffeine, indicating the need for additional experimentation to determine the role of water temperature in the availability of caffeine during extraction...|$|R
40|$|Using Intelligent Control Methodology Home coffee {{machines}} {{have improved}} over {{time with the}} addition of features such as self-activating timers and crude temperature controlled heating elements. However, home <b>coffee</b> <b>brewer</b> development has stagnated and has yet to achieve full automation status. Present coffee machines leave the user burdened with the mundane and messy task of preparing the coffee maker every time. Also, should the user decide to prepare less than an entire pot, he/she must estimate the correct amount of water and coffee to add. This can lead to a weak or strong brew, giving undesirable results. In order to make another pot, the user is then forced to clean the used coffee grounds and remove any unused coffee. The objective of this thesis is to design and construct a functional, fully automated coffee maker. The coffee maker, with its need for user input, varying grounds and water volume necessity, and sequential method of operation, is a prime candidate for fuzzy control implementation. The main focus of this project is a controller, which is implemented on a standard 486 computer running Linux Red Hat 7. The system is included in this project, but only as a means to test the functionality and efficiency of the controller. User input includes the amount of coffee desired, the strength of that coffee, and the ratio of regular to decaffeinated. These input variables can be effectively and easily defined by fuzzy membership functions. Also, when the coffee maker is not making coffee, the processor monitors water temperature for the next time it is needed and performs any necessary cleaning. Results demonstrate that the water and coffee temperatures can be kept within a tolerance of three degrees Fahrenheit. The open-loop coffee-dispensing controller is validated by expert evaluation since taste is the deciding factor. The efficiency of the water controller is determined by the accuracy of the volume of water obtained. Overshoot and steady-state-error are kept within strict tolerances for this specific application...|$|R
