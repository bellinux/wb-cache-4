In general, pine <b>needle</b> <b>gall</b> <b>midge</b> damage reaches a maximal level about 7 years following invasion by the midge, and parasite populations increase a few years thereafter. Four species of Platygastridae that parasitize the midge {{have been found in}} Korea, and their parasitization percentages are on the increase. Three of the parasites, P. matsutama, I. hockpari, and I. seoulis are effective natural enemies of the midge and have been utilized for biological control by translocation...|$|R

40|$|Population {{dynamics}} with {{spatial information}} {{is applied to}} understand the spread of pests. We introduce a model describing how pests spread in discrete space. The number of pest descendants at each site is controlled by local information such as temperature, precipitation, and the density of pine trees. Our simulation leads to a pest spreading pattern comparable to the real data for pine <b>needle</b> <b>gall</b> <b>midge</b> in the past. We also simulate the model in two different climate conditions based on two different representative concentration pathways scenarios for the future. We observe that after an initial stage of a slow spread of pests, a sudden change in the spreading speed occurs, which is soon followed by a large-scale outbreak. We found that a future climate change causes the outbreak point to occur earlier and that the detailed spatio-temporal pattern of the spread depends on the source position from which the initial pest infection starts.

40|$|The {{structural}} dynamics of host–parasitoid populations {{play a key}} role in the mechanism of natural community development with invasive species. Species invading new habitats experience coevolution with their newly acquired natural enemies, and their population dynamics are driven by a complex interaction between biological and environmental factors. We examined the biological and environmental factors which potentially influence a community of parasitoids throughout the 25 -year invasion history of the pine <b>needle</b> <b>gall</b> <b>midge</b> (PNGM), Thecodiplosis japonensis, an important pest of pines in eastern Asia. We found that differences in establishment sequence and competitive ability among the parasitoids attacking this species determined the parasitoid community’s structure and dynamics. In particular, the timing for the initial establishment of the host–parasitoid association, incomplete superiority in competition among parasitoids, and indirect competition by a combination of the parasitoids were important factors for determining community’s structure and dynamics. Finally, the history of change in the community composition could be explained by the phenology differences in its member species, mediated by environmental factors...|$|R

A set of 14 standard rice differentials representing four groups identified to characterize the prevailing rice <b>gall</b> <b>midge</b> biotypes in the country were evaluated against local <b>gall</b> <b>midge</b> populations in four locations. Based on the reaction pattern of standard differentials to <b>gall</b> <b>midge</b> populations, the biotype 1 <b>gall</b> <b>midge</b> was detected with R-R-R-S reaction pattern. The virulence composition was studied using three standard differentials viz., W 1263 (Gm 1 gene for resistance), Phalguna (Gm 2 gene for resistance) and TN 1 (susceptible without any gene). The local <b>gall</b> <b>midge</b> populations in all the test locations expressed their virulence only against susceptible group consisting TN 1. The fe-male to male sex ratio of their F 1 was close to 3 : 1 in TN 1.

The previous and current identification of these Korean <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> relied largely upon their gall morph and host plant species that correspond to those of Japanese gall modges. The identification of these <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> was considered to be mostly reliable, because DNA analysis suggested that some South Korean <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> were indentical with Japanese <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> when thwy induce the same sorts of gall on the same host plants as those in Japan.

40|$|Parallel {{alterations}} in {{the timing of}} ovarian Ecdysone Receptor and Ultraspiracle expression characterize the independent evolution of larval reproduction in two species of <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) Received: 30 July 1999 / Accepted: 23 Feburary 2000 Abstract Although most insects reproduce in the adult stage, facultative larval or pupal reproduction (paedogenesis) has evolved at least six times indepently in insects, twice in <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> of the family Cecidomyiidae (Diptera). Paedogenesis in <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> involves the precocious growth and differentiation of the ovary in an otherwise larval form. We have previously shown that the timing of expression of the Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle (USP), the two proteins that constitute the functional receptor for the steroid hormone 20 -hydroxyecdysone, regulates the timing and progression of ovarian differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae). Here we test the hypothesis that precocious activation of EcR and USP in the ovaries of paedogenetic <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> allows for precocious ovarian differentiation. Using monoclonal antibodies directed against insect EcR and USP proteins, we first show that when these <b>gall</b> <b>midges</b> are reared under conditions that promote typical, metamorphic development, upregulation of EcR and USP occurs in the final larval stage. By contrast, in the paedogenetic life cycle, EcR and USP are up-regulated early in the first larval stage. A similar pattern is seen for two independently-evolved paedogenetic <b>gall</b> <b>midges,</b> Heteropeza pygmaea and Mycophila speyeri. We discuss our results {{in the context of}} developmental constraints on the evolution of paedogenesis in dipteran insects...|$|R
