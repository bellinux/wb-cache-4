40|$|A {{penetration}} apparatus, {{for very}} high temperature applications {{in which a}} base plug is inserted into an opening through a bulkhead is described. The base plug has a head shape and is seated against the highest temperature surface of the bulkhead, {{which may be the}} skin of the nose cone or other part of a space vehicle intended for nondestructive atmospheric reentry. From the second side of the bulkhead at which the less severe environment is extant, a bayonet plug is inserted into the base plug and engages an internal shoulder at about 90 deg rotation. The bayonet plug has an integral flanged portion and a pair of ramping washers which are located between the flange and the second bulkhead surface with a <b>spacing</b> <b>washer</b> as necessary...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. As a {{new kind}} of cutting and {{grinding}} tool, diamond-bead wire has gained multi-patterns and many applications. It is commonly comprised of six elements pertaining to corresponding roles for the capacity of the wire: wire rope, diamond bead, clip, spacer, joint, spring or plastic/rubber. For further systematic understanding of diamond-bead wires, researching and developing new bead wiresï¼Œand making full use of bead wires, it is desperately needed to properly classify diamond-bead wires available and those that may exist in theory. The current study collected and analyzed systematically a hundred of patterns of diamond-bead wires from the diamond- bead wire manufacturers throughout the globe went insight into the essential elements of the wire, including the overall layout, shape characteristics, technological processes, cutting and grinding object, and studied in classification for the spectrum characteristics. And the structural feature covers skeleton package, <b>spacing</b> <b>washer,</b> and special structure; manufacturing process contains bead manufacturing methods and the wire producing processes; and sawing object includes the soft stone, hard stone, and other substances. A trial spectrum has been drawn on the POS classification. All the subjects were discussed and presented in two parts, and here is the first part for classification with processes and objects...|$|E
50|$|Stackable machines, on {{the other}} hand, are defined by two {{separate}} machines, a washer and a dryer, stacked {{on top of one}} another. These stackable machines are often a good choice for large families that still need the full capacity and functionality of a washer and dryer without having to compromise too much regarding <b>space.</b> Most stackable <b>washer</b> and dryer configurations come in the front-loading design as opposed to the top-loading design, which makes it easier to access both the washer and dryer while they are stacked.|$|R
50|$|National Lockwasher owned U.S. Patent 1,655,018, which covered split-ring, compression-spring {{lock washers}} with a {{construction}} {{preventing them from}} interlinking with one another when handled in bulk. The washer accomplishes this by making the helical ring-shaped washer extend more than 360 degrees in circumference, cutting {{the ends of the}} washer so that the end faces make an angle with the top and bottom faces of the washer, and making the spaces between the ends of the washer smaller than the thickness of the washer stock but large enough to allow compression to flatten the <b>washer.</b> (If the <b>space</b> is smaller than the thickness (cross-section height) of the washer stock, one washer cannot pass through the end <b>space</b> of another <b>washer</b> and entangle it.) A lock washer is used to prevent a screw, bolt, or nut from loosening under vibration. It operates as a spring under compression having sufficient elasticity to neutralize the play between the assembled parts that vibration causes.|$|R
