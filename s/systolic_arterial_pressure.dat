40|$|SUMMARY The intraocular {{pressure}} (IOP), tbe intraocular pulse to pressure (pulse/pressure) relationship, and the ophthalmic <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> have been measured in 20 patients with either unilateral or bilateral hemodynamically significant lesions of tbe internal carotid arteries (ICA) as determined from arteriography. Studies were repeated in 5 {{of the patients}} after surgical endarterectomy on the obstructed ICA. In age matched normal subjects the pulse/pressure relations were symmetrical in pairs of eyes, and the ophthalmic <b>arterial</b> <b>systolic</b> <b>pressure</b> was 89. 0 ± 2. 1 mm Hg; this was 66 ± 1 % of the brachial <b>arterial</b> <b>systolic</b> <b>pressure.</b> In 19 of 20 patients with carotid occlusive disease in this study the IOP, pulse amplitudes and the pulse/pressure relationships differed in pairs of eyes. The ophthalmic <b>arterial</b> <b>systolic</b> <b>pressure</b> on the sides with 95 to 100 % ICA stenosis was 49. 9 ± 4. 05 mm Hg, which was 33 ± 3 % of the brachial <b>arterial</b> <b>systolic</b> <b>pressure.</b> In the remaining eyes the degree of stenosis of the ipsilateral ICA was 363 ± 7. 9 %; the correspond-ing eyes had an ophthalmic <b>arterial</b> <b>systolic</b> <b>pressure</b> of 70. 1 ± 5. 18 mm Hg, which was 45 ± 4 % of the brachial <b>arterial</b> <b>systolic</b> <b>pressure.</b> Endarterectomy of the occluded arteries caused {{a significant increase in}} the ophthalmic <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> on the ipsilateral side and a smaller increase in the contralateral eye; these changes were associated with a statistically significant increase in the intraocular pulse and improvement in the pulse/pressure relation...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveMitral valve annuloplasty and {{mitral valve}} {{replacement}} are common {{strategies for the}} management of functional ischemic mitral regurgitation with ischemic cardiomyopathy. However, mitral valve annuloplasty may create some degree of functional mitral stenosis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the mitral valve hemodynamics in patients with functional ischemic mitral regurgitation undergoing mitral valve annuloplasty or mitral valve replacement, using exercise echocardiography. MethodsWe performed resting and exercise echocardiography in 70 patients matched for indexed effective orifice area, <b>systolic</b> pulmonary <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure,</b> and left ventricular ejection fraction after mitral valve annuloplasty or mitral valve replacement with coronary artery bypass grafting. ResultsThere was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding baseline demographic and clinical data. Exercise <b>systolic</b> pulmonary <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> was higher in the mitral valve annuloplasty group compared with the mitral valve replacement group (from 36. 3 ± 8. 1 mm Hg to 55 ± 12 mm Hg, vs mitral valve replacement: 33 ± 6 mm Hg to 42 ± 6. 2 mm Hg, P = . 0001). Exercise-induced improvement in effective orifice area and indexed effective orifice area was better in the mitral valve replacement group (mitral valve replacement: + 0. 23 ± 0. 04 vs mitral valve annuloplasty: − 0. 1 ± 0. 09 cm², P = . 001, for effective orifice area; mitral valve replacement: + 0. 14 ± 0. 03 vs mitral valve annuloplasty: − 0. 04 ± 0. 07 cm²/m², P = . 03, for indexed effective orifice area). Exercise indexed effective orifice area was correlated with exercise <b>systolic</b> pulmonary <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> (r = − 0. 45; P = . 01).

Methods: A population-based sample of 71 men and 79 women (35 – 64 years of age) was studied. Five-minute supine recordings of ECG and beat-to-beat photoplethysmographic finger <b>systolic</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> and diastolic arterial pressure were obtained during paced breathing. Power spectra were computed using a fast Fourier transform for low-frequency (0. 04 – 0. 15 Hz) and high-frequency (0. 15 – 0. 40 Hz) powers. BRS was calculated by cross-spectral analysis of R-R interval and <b>systolic</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> variabilities. Psychological factors were evaluated by three self-report questionnaires: the Brief Symptom Inventory, the shortened version of the Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Results: Psychological factors were not related to HRV. Anxiety was associated with decreased BRS (p 0. 001) and higher low-frequency (p 0. 002) power of <b>systolic</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> variability. These associations were independent of age, gender, other psychological factors, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Hostility was an independent correlate of increased low-frequency power of diastolic arterial pressure (p 0. 001) and increased high-frequency power of <b>systolic</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> (p 0. 033) variability. Conclusions: Anxiety and hostility are related to reduced BRS and increased low-frequency power of BPV.

Recurrence of chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation was defined as 2 +/ 4 + grade or greater mitral regurgitation at any time postoperatively. ResultsTwenty-two months of freedom from recurrent chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation was 58. 2 % ± 9. 8 %. Recurrent chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation did not lead to reverse remodeling of left atrial diameter, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, and ventricular indexed mass (P = not significant), with increased coaptation depth, parallel to follow-up chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation worsening. Effective restrictive mitral annuloplasty induced reverse remodeling of left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, and ventricular indexed mass, improved left ventricular ejection fraction, shortened coaptation depth, and improved mean gradient (P ≤. 014). Recurrent chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation in patients without tricuspid surgery prevented improvements of <b>systolic</b> pulmonary <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure,</b> tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, right ventricular ejection fraction, worsening New York Heart Association (P =. 003), and daily diuretic need (P =. 008), whereas effective restrictive mitral annuloplasty progressively improved tricuspid insufficiency grading, <b>systolic</b> pulmonary <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure,</b> right ventricular ejection fraction, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, New York Heart Association, and diuretic need (P ≤. 013).

40|$|ObjectiveCarotid artery stenting (CAS) {{has been}} {{introduced}} {{as an alternative to}} carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis. Both techniques seem to be associated with postoperative hemodynamic lability. Both may induce baroreceptor dysfunction, possibly leading to transient impairment of cardiovascular autonomic activity and resulting in hemodynamic instability. This instability might contribute to postoperative morbidity. To elucidate these phenomena, we studied the cardiac baroreflex and autonomic cardiovascular control after CAS and CEA. MethodIn 20 patients scheduled for CAS (n = 10) or CEA (n = 10), intra-arterial pressures and electrocardiograms were recorded during 10 minutes before and 8 and 24 hours after the procedure. Spontaneous cardiac baroreflex sensitivity was assessed using the sequence method and cross-spectral analysis. In addition, cardiovascular autonomic activity was investigated using spectral analysis of heart rate variability and <b>systolic</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> variability. ResultsAfter CAS, we demonstrated an increase of the spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity median (interquartile range) from 5. 6 (5. 1 to 6. 2) ms/mm Hg before the procedure to 8. 8 (6. 8 to 10. 5) ms/mm Hg and 7. 7 (3. 9 to 8. 6) ms/mm Hg (P <. 001), 8 and 24 hours after the procedure. This was consistent with the increase of the high frequency component of heart rate variability reflecting cardiac parasympathetic activity and a decrease of the low frequency of <b>systolic</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> variability reflecting sympathetic vascular activity. The postoperative period was also associated with decreased <b>systolic</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> from 173 (162 to 190) mm Hg at baseline to 122 (109 to 143) mm Hg and 136 (121 to 143) mm Hg at 8 and 24 hours after CAS (P <. 001). No changes in baroreflex sensitivity or in autonomic activity were observed after CEA.

Data in young patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus show a significant increase in arterial pressure, a reduced gain of the baroreflex regulation of the heart period, and an increase of the low-frequency component of <b>systolic</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> variability, suggestive of simultaneous impairment of vagal cardiac control and increases of sympathetic vasomotor regulation. A repeat study after 1 year shows a further increase of sympathetic cardiac and vascular modulation, suggesting early progression of the autonomic dysfunction. To focus on early cardiac and vascular autonomic dysfunction that might complicate type 1 diabetes mellitus in children, we planned an observational, cross-sectional study in a population of 93 young patients, under insulin treatment, subdivided in 2 age subgroups (children: 11. 50. 4 years; adolescents: 19. 30. 2 years). Time and frequency domain analysis of RR interval and <b>systolic</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> variability provided quantitative indices of the sympatho-vagal balance regulating the heart period, of the gain of cardiac baroreflex, and of the sympathetic vasomotor control. Sixty-eight children of comparable age served as a reference group. At rest, <b>systolic</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> and the power of its low-frequency component were greater in patients than in controls, particularly in children (14. 02. 3 versus 3. 10. 3 mm Hg 2). Moreover, baroreflex gain was significantly reduced in both subgroups of patients. Standing induced similar changes in the autonomic profiles of controls and patients. A repeat study after 1 year showed a progression in low-frequency oscillations of arterial pressure and a shift toward low frequency in RR variability. Data in young patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus show a significant increase in arterial pressure, a reduced gain of the baroreflex regulation of the heart period, and an increase of the low-frequency component of <b>systolic</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressure</b> variability, suggestive of simultaneous impairment of vagal cardiac control and increases of sympathetic vasomotor regulation.

40|$|This paper compiles the {{beneficial}} effects of cocoa polyphenols on human health, {{especially with regard}} to cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases, metabolic disorders, and cancer prevention. Their antioxidant properties may be responsible for many of their pharmacological effects, including the inhibition of lipid peroxidation and the protection of LDL-cholesterol against oxidation, and increase resistance to oxidative stress. The phenolics from cocoa also modify the glycemic response and the lipid profile, decreasing platelet function and inflammation along with diastolic and <b>systolic</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>pressures,</b> which, taken together, may reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality. Cocoa polyphenols can also modulate intestinal inflammation through the reduction of neutrophil infiltration and expression of different transcription factors, which leads to decreases in the production of proinflammatory enzymes and cytokines. The phenolics from cocoa may thus protect against diseases in which oxidative stress is implicated as a causal or contributing factor, such as cancer. They also have antiproliferative, antimutagenic, and chemoprotective effects, in addition to their anticariogenic effects...|$|R
