25|$|With the {{combining}} of {{the constituent}} firms, Allis-Chalmers offered {{a wide array}} of pyrometallurgic equipment, such as blast furnaces and converters for roasting, smelting, and refining; ore milling equipment, various kinds of crushers and pulverizers, including <b>stamp</b> mills, <b>roller</b> mills, ball mills, conical mills, rod mills, and jigging mills; cyanidation mills and other concentration mills; hoisting engines; cars, including , slag cars, and general mine cars; briquetting plants; and the pumps, tanks, boilers, compressors, hydraulic accumulators, pipes, valves, sieves, and conveyors needed within these products. Like other firms that build capital equipment for industrial corporations, it also supplied consulting, erecting, and training services, such as helping a mining company to design a plant, to build its buildings and set up its machinery, and to teach the employees how to use and maintain it.|$|R
500|$|The Olmecs {{were the}} first {{inhabitants}} of the Americas to construct monumental architecture and to settle in towns and cities. They were also the first people in the Americas to develop a sophisticated style of stone sculpture. In {{the first decade of}} the 21st century evidence emerged of Olmec writing, with the earliest examples of Olmec hieroglyphs dating to around 650 BC. Examples of script have been found on <b>roller</b> <b>stamps</b> and stone artefacts; the texts are short and have been partially deciphered based on their similarity to other Mesoamerican scripts. The evidence of complex society developing in the Olmec heartland has led to the Olmecs being regarded as the [...] "Mother Culture" [...] of Mesoamerica, although this concept remains controversial.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{thin film}} {{transfer}} mechanism {{has been studied}} and developed to transfer chemically reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) thin film using a roll-to-roll printing system. We discover that shear stress generated on the silicon rubber stamp surface facilitates delamination of the deposited r-GO thin film efficiently. A roll-to-roll apparatus is assembled to demonstrate the shear-induced transfer printing {{in a large scale}} printing system. Shear stress is applied on the stamp surface by rotating the <b>stamp</b> side <b>roller</b> faster than the substrate side roller. The hydrophobic surface is changed to hydrophilic by polydopamine modification for 15 minutes at 60 ˚C in order for r-GO thin film to be directly deposited on the rubber stamp. Roll-to-roll printing parameters such as evaporation time during deposition of r-GO, vertical deformation of stamp, RPM, and RPM ratio between two rollers are investigated and adjusted for successful transfer of r-GO. With the adjusted roll-to-roll printing parameters, r-GO thin film has been transferred successfully to glass and PET substrates at a printing rate of 5 mm/min. The shear stress required to transfer r-GO thin film in our experiment condition with glass substrate is estimated to be 325. 43 kPa by experimental data and computation with ANSYS. A flexible transparent capacitive touch sensor is fabricated with printed r-GO thin film after the sheet resistance is significantly improved by thermal annealing process. Both the shear-induced roll-to-roll printing method and the stamp modification process are expected to contribute to large scale manufacturing systems for flexible printed electronics...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dental caries is a multifactorial disease, and its {{etiology}} {{has been}} advocated to various environmental and genetic factors. Dermatoglyphics {{is the study}} of dermal ridges on the palmar and plantar surfaces of hands and feet. It is genetic in nature and is unique to each individual. Enamel as well as finger buds are ectodermal in origin and develop during the same time of intrauterine life; therefore, factors affecting dental caries may cause peculiarities in dermal ridge patterns. Aim: To find a correlation between dermatoglyphic pattern and dental caries in pediatric cases. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed on 200 children (100 caries-active and 100 caries-free) between the age range of 6 – 13 years. The decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) score was recorded for caries-active children having a score range of 3 – 6 and under each score there were 25 cases. Midlo and Cummins method (1943) of recording palm prints was used using Indiana Ink (<b>stamp</b> pad), <b>roller</b> and printing papers. The prints were inspected with the help of magnifying lens and whorls and loops in each hand were recorded. Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software 14. 00, and Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis of collected data. Results: The number of whorls was found to be more in caries-active children with increased number of whorls in children with a higher DMFT whereas the number of loops was more in caries-free children. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups (P < 0. 05). The number of whorls and loops was found to be more on the right hand as compared to the left hand. Conclusion: The results of the study indicate that there is a definite correlation between the number of whorls and loops and the presence of dental caries in children. Hence, dermatoglyphics {{can be used as a}} screening method to provide adequate preventive treatment to children showing a higher caries risk as detected by the hand ridge patterns...|$|R
30|$|After the {{post-mortem}} examination, the veterinary officers pass a judgement on {{the slaughter}} stock {{on whether it}} is fit for human consumption or not. The judgement stage is marked {{by the use of}} an edible red marker ink on the carcass that is passed fit for human consumption being <b>roller</b> <b>stamped.</b> The veterinary officers can pass their judgement on whether meat is fit for human consumption in two ways: either passing the meat unconditionally or passing the meat conditionally. The meat is passed unconditionally, when the inspectors have examined the carcass and passed it fit for human consumption without any conditions attached. They can also pass the meat conditionally when examination reveals the presence of parasitic cysts like Cysticercus bovis. The conditions are that when 1 to 5 cysts of the parasites are found, the meat is passed on condition that it is treated first either through sterilization (treating by steaming, boiling in a closed vault for about two and half hours at 770 C or rendering especially for pork) by heat or a cold treatment (freezing for 10  days at −[*] 10 degrees centigrade) of the meat before consumption and the infested parts are removed from the meat as well.|$|R
5000|$|Deritend ware is a {{distinctive}} style of medieval pottery produced in Birmingham, England in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. There are {{three types of}} Deritend ware; a fine to moderately sandy, micaceous orange to red ware (Glazed Deritend ware), used mainly for jugs, with some examples of bowls, dripping trays and aquamaniles, dating to the 13th to early 14th centuries; a black or, less frequently, grey ware with a brown core, also micaceous, (Reduced Deritend ware) used mainly for cooking pots/jars and less commonly large unglazed jugs and skillets/pipkins, dating from possibly the late 12th century to the early 14th century.; a sandy brown ware with grey core (Deritend cooking pot ware) used for cooking pots, dating from possibly the late 12th century to 13th century. Wasters i.e. pottery misfires have been found for all three wares in Birmingham. [...] Glazed Deritend ware jugs were decorated with white slip (liquid clay)lines and applied white clay strips, often <b>roller</b> <b>stamped,</b> and white clay pads, The more complex (and later) decorative schemes are in the North French style (c. AD 1275-1325); The decorated jugs closely resemble London-type ware and it is distinctly possible that the Deritend ware industry included migrant potters from the London area in the thirteenth century.|$|R
40|$|Caribbean {{archaeology}} {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of unsolved mysteries that still need to be solved. One of these mysteries concerns the subject of pre-Columbian ceramic stamps, better known as ‘body stamps’, which have been primarily related to body painting in previous works. Archaeological and anthropological investigations dealing with the tropical lowlands of South America and the Caribbean have been carried out since the early 1900 s. What has come to my attention is the lack of research that has been carried out on the topic of body painting and ceramic stamps. This thesis aims to enhance our general knowledge about the relationship between ceramic stamps in the Caribbean and the practice of body painting among contemporary Amerindian societies in the tropical lowlands of South America. Methods used in this thesis to reach this aim consist of: (1) gathering of as many photographs of stamps as possible for comparative reasons, (2) analyzing the available ethnographical and ethno-historical information to support the archaeological data, and (3) using the South American Lowland traditions to make an analogy for the practice of body painting in the Caribbean. The use of these methods brings us to several conclusions concerning the relationship between ceramic stamps and body painting. Firstly, ethno-historical sources confirm the practice of body painting in the Caribbean. Secondly, ethnographical research carried out by Kaplan and Overing (1980), brings forward the contemporary use of wooden stamps among the Piaroa, which {{can be used to make}} a hypothesis about the function of ceramic stamps in the Caribbean. Thirdly, by analyzing the stylistic traits and their chronological context, we can determine that the ceramic stamps of the Caribbean were presumably related to the <b>roller</b> <b>stamps</b> of the Middle Orinoco belonging to the Arauquinoid pottery tradition. Lastly, by analyzing the stamp motifs and their relation to Amerindian mythology described by early ethnographers, we can determine whether these stamps played a role in the Amerindian worldview...|$|R
