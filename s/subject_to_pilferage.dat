This system is susceptible <b>to</b> <b>pilferage</b> and anyone can remove petrol from the fuel tank without trouble. Each petrol tank has capacity of at least 10 Ltrs.

50|$|In July 1970, Macias {{created a}} single-party state and by May 1971, key {{portions}} of the constitution were abrogated. In 1972 Macias took complete {{control of the government}} and assumed the title of President for Life. The Macias regime was characterized by abandonment of all government functions except internal security, which was accomplished by terror; this led to the death or exile of up to one-third of the country's population. Due <b>to</b> <b>pilferage,</b> ignorance, and neglect, the country's infrastructure—electrical, water, road, transportation, and health—fell into ruin. The private and public sectors of the economy were devastated. Nigerian contract labourers on Bioko, estimated to have been 60,000, left en masse in early 1976. The economy collapsed, and skilled citizens and foreigners left.|$|R
5000|$|Security - Packaging {{can play}} an {{important}} role in reducing the security risks of shipment.

Packages may include authentication seals to help indicate that the package and contents are not counterfeit.

25|$|Packaging {{sometimes}} {{must be made}} {{difficult to}} open. For example, regulations dictate that some over-the-counter drugs have tamper resistance to deter unauthorized opening before delivery to the intended customer and be in child-resistant packaging.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the impact of}} failure models {{on the performance of}} transfer lines composed of N machines separated by N - 1 buffers. The two most used failure models, operation-dependent failures (ODF) and time-dependent failures (TDF), are considered. A machine <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> TDF can fail even it is not working on a part. A machine <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> ODF cannot fail if it is not working on a part. A transfer line considered in this paper contains both machines <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> TDF and machines <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> ODF. Up times, repair times and processing times are continuous random variables of general distribution. We prove that modelling a machine <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> ODF of a transfer line as a machine <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> TDF, as usually done in the literature, leads to under-estimation of the throughput rate if the time between failures of the related machine is exponentially distributed while all other times are general random variables. We then propose a timed Petri net approach for performance evaluation and simulation of transfer lines with both machines <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> TDF and machines <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> ODF. Numerical results show that this result holds under more general conditions...|$|R
