5|$|Scientific {{interpretations of}} the crest's {{function}} began in 1910, when George Francis Eaton proposed two possibilities: an aerodynamic counterbalance and a muscle attachment point. He suggested that the crest might have anchored large, long jaw muscles, but admitted that this function alone could not explain the large size of some crests. Bennett (1992) agreed with Eaton's own assessment that the crest was too large and variable {{to have been a}} muscle attachment site. Eaton had suggested that a secondary function of the crest might have been as a counterbalance against the long beak, reducing the need for heavy neck muscles to control the orientation of the head. Wind tunnel tests showed that the crest did function as an effective counterbalance to a degree, but Bennett noted that again, the hypothesis focuses only on the long crests of male P. longiceps, not on the larger crests of P. sternbergi and very small crests that existed among the females. Bennett found that the crests of females had no counterbalancing effect, and that the crests of male P. sternbergi would, by themselves, {{have a negative effect on}} the balance of the head. In fact, <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> <b>movement</b> of the crests would have required more, not less, neck musculature to control balance.|$|E

50|$|The Tunnel fin {{is based}} on the {{principle}} of the annular wing with the lowest drag and highest lift fin configuration possible. It has no drag inducing fin tips, this is important as it means that rail to rail turning movements are dragfree and effortless. Tunnel fins have the ability to enhance hydrodynamics by slightly twisting the water flow into a vortex as it passes through the tunnel, preventing random turbulence in its wake. The tunnel fin has a large amount of horizontal lift utilizing the hydrofoil principle providing better lift-to-drag ratio.The horizontal area in the tunnel fin also acts as a means of transferring rider energy into forward thrust through board flex (similar to a dolphin tail). As the board pumps up and down it drives the 'fluke' at the tail. In other words, the speed of the tunnel finned board can be increased by weighting and unweighting (pumping). This is slightly different from the <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> <b>movement</b> used by thruster riders.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: All-terrain {{vehicles}} (ATVs) require “active riding, ” meaning operators must rapidly assess {{changes in}} vehicle stability and adjust body position to compensate. No {{previous studies have}} reported using an ATV simulator to study active riding by human subjects. An ATV was mounted to a computer-controlled platform. Ride-file programs were developed which included sudden vehicle pitch (upward/downward) and roll (<b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side)</b> <b>movements.</b> A motion-capture system and accelerometers collected data that were analyzed with 3 D modeling software. The posture and dynamic response to simulated sudden terrain changes for five adult males with ATV riding experience were determined. This study provides proof-of-principle {{for the use of}} ATV simulation to study active riding. In addition, the response patterns of experienced adult ATV operators can now be compared to that of other groups (e. g. inexperienced operators, children, drivers with passengers) to determine potential differences that might contribute to loss of vehicle control and crashing...|$|R
40|$|Postural {{control is}} not a fully {{automatic}} process, but requires {{a certain level of}} attention, particularly as the difficulty of the postural task increases. This study aimed at testing whether experienced contemporary dancers, because of their specialized training involving the control of posture/balance, would present with a dual-task performance suggesting lesser attentional demands associated with dynamic postural control compared with non-dancers. Twenty dancers and 16 non-dancers performed a dynamic postural tracking task in both antero-posterior and side-to-side directions, while standing on a force platform. The postural task was performed, in turn, 1) as a stand-alone task, and concurrently with both 2) a simple reaction time task and 3) a choice reaction time task. Postural control performance was estimated through variables calculated from centre of pressure movements. Although no overall group difference was found in reaction time values, we found a better ability <b>to</b> control the <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> <b>movements</b> of the centre of pressure during the tracking task in dancers compared with non-dancers, which was dependent on the secondary task. This suggests that such increased ability is influenced by available attentional resources...|$|R

50|$|The spinal {{pia mater}} closely follows and {{encloses}} {{the curves of}} the spinal cord, and is attached to it through {{a connection to the}} anterior fissure. The pia mater attaches to the dura mater through 21 pairs of denticulate ligaments that pass through the arachnoid mater and dura mater of the spinal cord. These denticular ligaments help to anchor the spinal cord and prevent <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> <b>movement,</b> providing stability. The membrane in this area is much thicker than the cranial pia mater, due to the two-layer composition of the pia membrane. The outer layer, which is made up of mostly connective tissue, is responsible for this thickness. Between the two layers are spaces which exchange information with the subarachnoid cavity as well as blood vessels. At the point where the pia mater reaches the conus medullaris or medullary cone {{at the end of the}} spinal cord, the membrane extends as a thin filament called the filum terminale or terminal filum, contained within the lumbar cistern. This filament eventually blends with the dura mater and extends as far as the coccyx, or tailbone. It then fuses with the periosteum, a membrane found at the surface of all bones, and forms the coccygeal ligament. There it is called the central ligament and assists with movements of the trunk of the body.|$|E
50|$|Toward {{the end of}} 1987 Pinckney {{was invited}} to {{represent}} the United States in the World Elephant Polo Competition.

At 5’1 she wasn’t sure how {{she would be able}} to swing the eight-foot polo stick while seated on an elephant more than twice her height. She was also worried about how it would affect her fragile back. She was in the middle of writing a new book called Callanetics For Your Back. After years of suffering, she had found the answer to maintaining a good back for a lifetime. The last thing she wanted now was an injury to the area she was working so hard to protect. When she was shown pictures of the beautiful elephants she was persuaded to take up the offer. She put together the Callanetics Ladies Team which included amongst others, killer whale trainer Judy Peterson. They wore beautifully styled red and white uniforms which won them the title of Best Dressed Team. Overall they finished in sixth place, losing 4-1 to The Tiger Tops Tigresses but tying with the British Gurkhas. Her experience on the elephant actually did wonders for her back. She found the gentle <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> <b>movement</b> of the elephant's torso to be extremely relaxing and soothing.|$|E

50|$|The boys {{shake their}} knees (as scissors, from there {{the use of}} the word pāoti (scissors) for this {{movement}}), and the girls shake their hips (and their long, loose hairs, if they have them). In reality the movement of their knees is the engine which drives their hips. Their feet should stay flat on the ground and their shoulders should remain stationary. However traditionally in the Ote'a or Ura Pa'u, the hips in Tahiti are shaken round and round (in what is known as the fa'arapu) while in the Cook Islands the hips are in a <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> <b>movement.</b> But due to the tamure, this emphasis is less important. The movements of the hands is of secondary importance. The girls are largely standing still, the boys move around their partner, either facing her in front or hiding behind her back (as seen from the public). The tempo of the music is continuously increased up to the point where only the most experienced and fittest dancers can keep their shakings up. Depending on the performers, the sexual innuendo may be more or less obvious. The predecessor of the tāmūrē, the traditional upaupa was outlawed by the LMS missionaries for that reason.Tāmūrē is a foreign word, the name of a fish in the Tuamotu, the real name of the dance is ori Tahiti (Tahitian dance). Shortly after the Second World War a soldier of the Pacific battalion, Louis Martin, wrote a song on a classic rhythm in which he used the word tāmūrē quite often as a tra-la-la. He afterwards was known as Tāmūrē Martin, and a new genre was born.|$|E

Due to the fact that bees show a strong reaction to intermittent optical stimulation, the proportion of bees settling on the moving section of the flower bed is increased.

40|$|Diabetic {{peripheral}} neuropathy {{is believed to}} cause postural instability due to abnormal proprioception. We assessed body sway in four groups, each of 20 subjects, matched for age, sex, and BMI: non-diabetic controls, non-neuropathic diabetic controls, subjects with diabetic neuropathy and no history of foot ulceration, and subjects with diabetic neuropathy {{and a history of}} foot ulceration. Postural sway was assessed on a Kistler force plate using the Romberg test, measuring the standard deviation of the centre of pressure in both sagittal (antero-posterior movement) and frontal (<b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> <b>movement)</b> planes with eyes open and closed. The Romberg test results were log transformed and then analysed using analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls test. There {{was no significant difference in}} body sway between the two control groups and the first group of subjects with diabetic neuropathy. However, in patients with a history of ulceration, values were significantly higher (p < 0. 05) compared to all other groups in both planes and conditions studied.

40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} {{that exposure to}} prolonged free fall {{is a form of}} sensory/motor rearrangement rather than a direct change in otolith sensitivity or sensory compensation for a reduced otolith input. The rearrangement of stimuli will force a new interpretation by the CNS of otolith input. This reinterpretation is necessary for a structured and meaningful interaction with the new environment. Data from two flight experiments are presented which support an otolith reinterpretation hypothesis. The first experiment measured vestibulo-spinal reflex changes as a function of sustained free fall. Findings indicate that when a monosynaptic reflex (H-reflex), measured from the major postural muscles (soleus), is used adaptation to space flight includes a change in how the CNS interprets a fall. In a normal gravity environment a sudden unexpected fall will produce a potentiated H reflex. After seven days in flight an equivalent fall does not potentiate the reflex. During postflight a greatly increased reflex is observed in those crewmen most susceptible to space motion sickness. In the second experiment self motion perception and torsional eyemovements were modified as a function of exposure to sustained free fall. Preflight roll motion (about the X axis) was perceived as pure roll, and the eye movements recorded were countertorsional. Postflight, roll stimulation was perceived as linear translation (<b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>side</b> <b>movement)</b> with a small angular motion component. Eye movement measurements confirmed significantly more horizontal motion...|$|E
