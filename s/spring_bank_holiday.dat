5|$|The Cotswold Olimpick Games is {{an annual}} public celebration of games and sports now {{held on the}} Friday after <b>Spring</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> near Chipping Campden, in the Cotswolds of England. The Games {{probably}} began in 1622, and have continued on and off to the present day. They were started by a local lawyer, Robert Dover, {{with the approval of}} King James. Dover's motivation in organising the Games may have been his belief that physical exercise was necessary for the defence of the realm, but he may also have been attempting to bring rich and poor together; the Games were attended by all classes of society, including royalty on one occasion.|$|E
5|$|Dover's Hill {{was bought}} by the National Trust in 1928, and until {{recently}} contained a monument to Robert Dover. The Games were revived for the 1951 Festival of Britain, but {{did not return to}} being a regular event until the Robert Dover's Games Society was founded in 1965. Except when exceptionally bad weather or an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease has forced their cancellation the Games have been held each year since 1966, on the evening of the Friday after <b>Spring</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday,</b> and attract thousands of visitors. An actor dressed as Dover arrives on horseback to open the games. Events have included the tug of war, gymkhana, shin-kicking, dwile flonking, motorcycle scrambling, judo, piano smashing, morris dancing, and, in 1976, poetry. After dusk a bonfire is lit, followed by a torchlight procession to the square in Chipping Campden, where the entertainment continues well into the night.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham {{is home to}} many national, {{religious}} and spiritual festivals including a St. George's Day party. The Birmingham Tattoo is a long-standing military show held annually at the National Indoor Arena. The Caribbean-style Birmingham International Carnival takes place in odd numbered years. The UKâ€™s largest two-day Gay Pride is Birmingham Pride (LGBT festival), which is typically held over the <b>spring</b> <b>bank</b> <b>holiday</b> weekend in May. The streets of Birmingham's gay district pulsate with a carnival parade, live music, a dance arena with DJs, cabaret stage, women's arena and a community village. Birmingham Pride {{takes place in the}} gay village. From 1997 until December 2006, the city hosted an annual arts festival ArtsFest, the largest free arts festival in the UK at the time. The city's largest single-day event is its St. Patrick's Day parade (Europe's second largest, after Dublin). Other multicultural events include the Bangla Mela and the Vaisakhi Mela. The Birmingham Heritage Festival is a Mardi Gras style event in August. Caribbean and African culture are celebrated with parades and street performances by buskers.|$|E
50|$|It {{opens to}} the public monthly, or by arrangement. There are also other open days, which tend to take place during the <b>Spring</b> and Summer <b>Bank</b> <b>Holidays.</b>|$|R
5000|$|From 1984 until 1990, {{the station}} briefly {{came back into}} {{passenger}} use, when special Christmas shopping services between Aylesbury and [...] were operated by British Rail Network SouthEast on Saturdays only, and stopped at Quainton Road. From August <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> 1971 until the 1987 season, and again from August <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> 2001 the station has had special passenger trains from Aylesbury in connection with events at the Centre - these shuttles now run regularly each <b>Spring</b> and August <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> weekend.|$|R
50|$|Ingleborough Cave {{is a show}} cave open to the public, {{accessed}} {{through the}} grounds of the Ingleborough Estate. Beyond the show cave a path continues through the gorge of Trow Gill and Gaping Gill. Local caving clubs set up a winch down Gaping Gill during the <b>Spring</b> and August <b>bank</b> <b>holidays,</b> when it is open to the public.|$|R
25|$|Holidays are currently: New Year's Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, May Bank Holiday, <b>Spring</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday,</b> Summer Bank Holiday, and Christmas Day.|$|E
25|$|Until 2005, {{there was}} an annual {{carnival}} held on the <b>Spring</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> but this has been cancelled due to rising policing costs.|$|E
25|$|The Lichfield Greenhill Bower {{takes place}} {{annually}} on <b>Spring</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday.</b> Originating from a celebration {{that was held}} after the Court of Arraye in the 12th century, the festival has evolved into its modern form, but has kept many of its ancient traditions. After a recreation of the Court of Arraye at the Guildhall, a procession of marching bands, morris men and carnival floats makes {{its way through the}} city and the Bower Queen is crowned outside the Guildhall. There is a funfair in the city centre, and another fair and jamboree in Beacon Park.|$|E
5000|$|The Bower is {{well known}} in Lichfield, England and nearby areas. It is a festival held each <b>spring</b> on a <b>bank</b> <b>holiday.</b> It is about 800 years old. A statute of Henry II of England (1134-1159) ordered that all men capable of bearing arms should be {{inspected}} by the magistrates. Since there was no standing army, this was a way to find out how many men could fight in a war. The men would then march through the streets and retire at a [...] "Bower House" [...] for roast beef and spirits. This ensured a good turn-out.|$|R
500|$|The Quainton Railway Society, which {{operates}} the station as the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre, restored the main station building to its 1900 appearance. A smaller {{building on the}} former Brill platform, once a shelter for passengers waiting for Brill and down trains, was used first as a store then as a shop {{for a number of}} years before its current use to house an exhibit on the history of the Brill Tramway. A former London Transport building from Wembley Park was dismantled and re-erected at Quainton Road to serve as a maintenance shed. From 1984 until 1990, the station briefly came back into passenger use, when special Saturday Christmas shopping services between Aylesbury and [...] were operated by British Rail Network SouthEast on Saturdays only, and stopped at Quainton Road. From August <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> 1971 until the 1987 season, and again from August <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> 2001 the station has had special passenger trains from Aylesbury in connection with events at the Centre - these shuttles now run regularly each <b>Spring</b> and August <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> weekend.|$|R
5|$|After {{a public}} meeting in Amlwch to gauge local support, Isle of Anglesey Railways Ltd (IoAR) was {{established}} in 1991 {{with the aim of}} restoring passenger services to the line. Special trains ran from Bangor to a temporary station at Amlwch on the <b>Spring</b> and August <b>bank</b> <b>holidays</b> of 1992, and the 125th anniversary of the line's opening (a total of eight return trips). Pathfinder Tours subsequently ran an excursion from York to Llandudno and Amlwch in October 1993. The project's viability was discussed with the Welsh Development Agency and Anglesey District Council, followed by negotiations in July 1993 with Railfreight Distribution to purchase the line. Octel offered a portion of its private railway for the building of a new station at Amlwch. IoAR initially hoped to start passenger services between Amlwch and Llangefni as early as 1994.|$|R
25|$|The last {{scheduled}} {{passenger trains}} hauled by 5700s on BR were on seen London Midland Region on the Wrexham to New Brighton route (passing over old LNER territory). The Wrexham to Seacombe service ended {{at the beginning}} of 1960 but was immediately replaced by a Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) service between Wrexham and New Brighton. The service on Bank Holidays was so popular that demand outstripped available DMUs, and a relief train of four coaches pulled by No. 3749 was laid on. Two more 5700s were used over the <b>Spring</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> that year, but from then BR Standard Class 4 2-6-4T locomotives usually handled the relief services. In 1965 5700s were used for the last time on Whit Monday and August Bank Holiday relief services.|$|E
25|$|A {{century after}} the 1871 Act, the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971, which {{currently}} regulates bank holidays in the UK, was passed. The {{majority of the}} current bank holidays were specified in the 1971 Act: however New Year's Day and May Day were not introduced throughout {{the whole of the}} UK until 1974 and 1978 respectively. The date of the August bank holiday was changed from the first Monday in August to the last Monday in August, and the Whitsun bank holiday (Whit Monday) was replaced by the Late <b>Spring</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday,</b> fixed as the last Monday in May. In 1978 the first Monday in May {{in the rest of the}} UK, and the final Monday of May in Scotland, were designated as bank holidays.|$|E
25|$|The Test match season finally {{started on}} 26 May, with Bangladesh {{completely}} overwhelmed {{in just over}} two days. After being dismissed for 108, Bangladesh could only watch as England made 528 for 3 declared, Marcus Trescothick top-scoring with 194. In their second innings, the tourists could only muster 159 as they went down by a mammoth innings and 261 runs. The one-day league games played over the <b>Spring</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> weekend left Middlesex top of Division One, with Essex one win behind them with two games in hand. Gloucestershire, Hampshire and Nottinghamshire (who had not won a game {{by the end of}} May) were in the relegation spots. As with the County Championship, Durham led the Second Division from Yorkshire, with Derbyshire, Scotland and Leicestershire occupying the bottom three places.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, the <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> (Ireland) Act added 17 March, Saint Patrick's Day, as a <b>bank</b> <b>holiday</b> for Ireland only. New Year's Day did {{not become}} a <b>bank</b> <b>holiday</b> in England until 1 January 1974.|$|R

(The Act does not provide for a <b>bank</b> <b>holiday</b> to be suppressed by royal proclamation without appointing another day in its place).|$|R
500|$|Revived {{after the}} Restoration of 1660, the Games {{gradually}} degenerated into a {{drunk and disorderly}} country festival according to their critics. The Games ended again in 1852, when the common land on {{which they had been}} staged was partitioned between local landowners and farmers and subsequently enclosed. Since 1966 the Games have been held each year on the Friday after <b>Spring</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday.</b> Events have included the tug of war, gymkhana, shin-kicking, dwile flonking, motorcycle scrambling, judo, piano smashing, and morris dancing. The British Olympic Association has recognised the Cotswold Olimpick Games as [...] "the first stirrings of Britain's Olympic beginnings".|$|E

50|$|This {{contrasts}} with {{other parts of}} the United Kingdom. St Patrick's Day has been a <b>bank</b> <b>holiday</b> in Northern Ireland since the enactment of the <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> (Ireland) Act 1903, and in 2007 the Scottish Parliament - which has greater devolved powers than the Welsh Assembly - passed the St Andrew's Day <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> (Scotland) Act 2007 which made St Andrew's Day a <b>bank</b> <b>holiday</b> in Scotland. <b>Bank</b> <b>holidays</b> in the United Kingdom do not entitle workers to a statutory holiday or extra pay on these days.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, the Scottish Parliament {{passed the}} St. Andrew's Day <b>Bank</b> <b>Holiday</b> (Scotland) Act 2007, which {{designated}} the Day {{as an official}} <b>bank</b> <b>holiday.</b> If 30 November falls on a weekend, the next Monday is a <b>bank</b> <b>holiday</b> instead. Although it is a <b>bank</b> <b>holiday,</b> <b>banks</b> {{are not required to}} close and employers are not required to give their employees the day off as a holiday.|$|R
50|$|Section 1 of the 1971 Act also {{provides}} that special days may be appointed as <b>bank</b> <b>holidays</b> (either additional or {{in place of}} <b>bank</b> <b>holidays</b> which fall on a Saturday or Sunday) subject to Royal Proclamation each year. These include Boxing Day, {{which has been a}}n additional <b>bank</b> <b>holiday</b> in Scotland since 1974 and the last Monday in May which has been a <b>bank</b> <b>holiday</b> since 1978.|$|R
