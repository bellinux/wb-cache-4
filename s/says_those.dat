500|$|Scholars and {{academics}} have offered many possible readings of American Beauty; film critics are similarly divided, {{not so much}} {{about the quality of the}} film, as their interpretations of it. Described by many as about [...] "the meaning of life" [...] or [...] "the hollow existence of the American suburbs", the film has defied categorization by even the filmmakers. Mendes is indecisive, saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it: [...] "a mystery story, a kaleidoscopic journey through American suburbia, a series of love stories; it was about imprisonment, loneliness, [...] beauty. It was funny; it was angry, sad." [...] The literary critic and author Wayne C. Booth concludes that the film resists any one interpretation: [...] " [...] cannot be adequately summarized as 'here is a satire on what's wrong with American life'; that plays down the celebration of beauty. It is more tempting to summarize it as 'a portrait of the beauty underlying American miseries and misdeeds', but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror, and Ball's disgust with our mores. It cannot be summarized with either Lester or Ricky's philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live." [...] He argues that the problem of interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its center—a controlling voice who [...] " [...] all of the choices". He contends that in American Beautys case, it is neither Mendes nor Ball. Mendes considers the voice to be Ball's, but even while the writer was [...] "strongly influential" [...] on set, he often had to accept deviations from his vision, particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic. With [...] "innumerable voices intruding on the original author's," [...] Booth <b>says,</b> <b>those</b> who interpret American Beauty [...] "have forgotten to probe for the elusive center". According to Booth, the film's true controller is the creative energy [...] "that hundreds of people put into its production, agreeing and disagreeing, inserting and cutting".|$|E

Trump writes, [...] "think positively and expect the best. My positive attitude has brought me a lot of luck." [...] He <b>says</b> <b>those</b> who seek out their passions in life will find financial success. He tells readers to devote two hours a day focusing on how to generate money. The book talks about the importance of concentration on the task at hand, writing, [...] "Focus is a tricky thing. Focus does not mean that you narrow your mind and become inflexible. That is taking focus too far." [...] Trump describes his expectations of loyalty from his employees, writing, [...] "I try to hire people who are honest and loyal. I value loyalty very much. I put the people who are loyal to me on a high pedestal and take care of them very well. I go out of my way for the people who were loyal to me in bad times." [...] Trump cites Hillary Clinton as an example of an individual with [...] "the ability to think big", calling her [...] "a fantastic person" [...] and a [...] "very good person". He warns about repercussions for disloyalty, [...] "They must respect or even fear you, or things will go very wrong.

2500|$|It {{originally}} required motorists {{to pay for}} the towing {{of their}} stalled vehicle, but at reduced prices set by the city. Tow truck drivers claimed that the program hurt their business and nine wrecker companies filed lawsuits against the city. White testified in court in the case. In addition the SafeClear Program has been blamed for causing the deaths of people, who seemed to be trying to get their cars off the freeway without having to pay fees to the tow truck drivers. The cause of death of these people, however, is uncertain. State Senator John Whitmire recruited 30 out of 31 Texas State Senators' votes to make the SafeClear program illegal. White responded to the controversy and criticism by changing the rules of the program and the towing laws, including free towing for limited distances funded by the city. The program was adapted to include strict licensing of SafeClear wreckers including criminal background checks, allowing the towed motorist to be towed for one mile for free, preventing the City leasing stretches of state-owned highway to private wrecker companies, and requiring revenue generated from the program to enter a mobility fund. White also worked with John Whitmire to address the objections of the senators, keeping the program alive but in a different format. He also rode with a wrecker and conducted several studies of the program. Despite the controversy, independent studies have found that the program has helped. Studies show that the program has been successful in decreasing accidents. A study, conducted by Rice University and Texas A University found that the number of freeway crashes decreased by 10.4%, [...] or nearly 2,000 crashes. According to these results, drivers in Houston saved approximately $35 million by the implementation of the program. However Suzanne Poole, president of the Houston Professional Towing Association, <b>says</b> <b>those</b> numbers are misleading and actual crashes are actually higher. In reference to the program's objective to decrease traffic congestion, a study by KHOU-TV found that average drive times increased at 86% of freeways into Houston six months after the program was implemented compared to before the program. However, some claim that more cars were on the roads during these six months and that construction on the freeways, particularly on US 59, caused drive times to increase. Nonetheless, SafeClear remained one of the most controversial, and one of few controversies, during his time as mayor.|$|E
