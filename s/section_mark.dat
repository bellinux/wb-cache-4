50|$|Two {{different}} styles are observed {{over the course}} of the 19th century, with the later style representing a simplified version of the original style. Some consonants begin to represent their aspirated and implosive forms. The script also functions more as an abjad than as an abugida, as vowels are not marked unless the word is monosyllabic and as there are no dependent vowel signs, only independent ones that can appear at the beginning of a word, as with other Indic scripts. There is no virama, and consonant clusters are written with independent consonants. There is one <b>section</b> <b>mark</b> punctuation that has been identified. The independent vowels, of which there are only four, represent both short and long forms of the independent vowels in addition to phonological variations, and 'i' sometimes represents 'ya'. Ultimately, many consonants represent multiple sounds, and the digits largely represent those found in Gurmukhi, with the exception of 6 and 7, which resemble Devanagari more closely.|$|E

5000|$|This {{ends the}} section of Mark showing how Jesus was the prophesied Jewish Messiah {{but not in the}} way people had expected. It was the general belief that the Messiah's coming would inaugurate the final victory of good over evil, and end all worldly suffering, thought to be a symptom of evil. [...] Jesus entered Jerusalem in Mark 11 in the manner of the messiah who would bring God's kingdom on Earth, then cursed the fig tree outside the Temple in which he fought with the money changers. He then {{defeated}} the priests and taught the people, establishing his authority and the priests lack of it. He then ends with a prediction of the Temple's destruction and then uses the fig tree as metaphor to show how what Jesus has described will lead to the coming of God's kingdom. Yet whereas the Messiah entering Jerusalem as Jesus had done was to bring God's rule immediately, Jesus says that it will come later, at an unknown time after seemingly calamitous events. Jesus is speaking of these things on the Mount of Olives, where Zechariah 14:4 has the final messianic battle occurring. In the next and final <b>section</b> <b>Mark</b> shows the necessity of suffering, Jesus' Passion, as a part of God's plan. Jesus is crowned the King of the Jews only on the cross and only overcomes all suffering and evil by his resurrection from the dead.|$|E
40|$|This thesis takes a novel, inter-disciplinary {{approach}} to {{an examination of}} the Markan evangelist’s portrayal of Jesus’ interface with Gentiles in a central section of his Gospel (Mk 4. 35 - 9. 29). As a framework to this <b>section,</b> <b>Mark</b> created a connected account of Jesus’ itinerary that included trips to perform miracles in the Gentile territories of Gerasa, Tyre, Bethsaida, the wider Decapolis and Caesarea Philippi. This thesis examines the role of these pericopae in the narrative as a whole and challenges the view that Mark’s geographical references were largely symbolic, rural {{and for the most part}} aimed at Jewish followers. The study scrutinizes Mark’s choice of geographical locations, systematically examines recent research on the religious milieu in these specific locations and brings this research into connection with the Gentile mission portrayed by Mark. The polytheistic and social environment in which Mark’s first century audience functioned has received little attention in recent scholarship and represents a lacuna in New Testament historical-critical research which this study addresses. A detailed exegesis of this section of the narrative concludes that Mark (a) deliberately redacts his text to place miracles in geographical regions where Gentiles predominate; (b) emphasizes obduracy and faithlessness on the part of Jewish officialdom and the Jewish disciples, in contrast to an implied understanding on the part of the Gentiles; (c) orchestrates a prolonged and sustained Jesus mission to the Gentiles as a precursor to his own community’s mission, to respond to their need for support and reassurance and (d) formulates his narrative to engage with his intended first century audience's Graeco-Roman religious and social worldview, inviting them to make comparison between the activities of Jesus and other contemporary miracle-performing men and polytheistic gods. ...|$|E
40|$|The percent {{carrying}} capacity Kp is the equilibrium population in percentage {{terms of a}} species that an area can support while adequately {{meeting the needs of}} every individual. It is readily determined from a time series of percentage abundances for a species, in which pit is the percentage abundance of the ith species at time t. The percentage point change in abundance of a species Dpi between two samples is given by Dpi = pit + 1 ? pit, where pit + 1 is the percentage abundance at a subsequent time t + 1. The rate of population change in percentage points for each percent at a given time or point t, here termed rt, is given by rt = Dpi/pit. Linear regression of rt against pit gives rt = rm-s · pit, in which the constant rm is the rate of increase in rt where pit approaches zero, and the negative slope s represents the combined strength of intraspecific, interspecific and abiotic interactions for the species investigated. Setting rt = 0, so that pit = Kp and rm-s · Kp = 0, gives Kp = rm/s. The Upper Quaternary of ODP 1006 A contains two subsections with rich bathyal benthic foraminiferal assemblages separated by samples yielding few specimens. Values of rm, s and Kp were calculated for five species (Globocassidulina subglobosa, Planulina ariminensis, Cibicidoides pachyderma, Cassidulina laevigata, Uvigerina laevis) within these subsections and 95 % confidence intervals were computed for rm and s. The rate of change of the percentage abundance for each percent rt, as indicated by the slope s, differs between species (P. ariminensis and C. pachyderma vs. C. laevigata) and can also vary within a single species over time (G. subglobosa). Likewise, values of rm differ between species (P. ariminensis vs. C. pachyderma) and can also change within a single species over time (G. subglobosa). Points of change from one value of Kp to another in a stratigraphic <b>section</b> <b>mark</b> regime shifts and have potential for ecostratigraphic correlation. Within the Upper Quaternary of ODP Hole 1006 A they apparently reflect an increase in the organic matter flux in the uppermost part of the section. The method described here can be applied to any species in any taxon for which percentage data are available. For those in the hydrocarbon industry it should prove especially useful for detailed studies of intervals of economic interest...|$|E
