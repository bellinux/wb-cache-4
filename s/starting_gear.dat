50|$|A {{paddling}} trip usually {{done by a}} group {{where they}} will descend a technical creek {{over a period of}} days. The group will usually survive on supplies they begin the trip with stored in their creek boats. The level of difficulty in creeking makes packing for overnight trips especially challenging as adding weight to the kayak can severely hamper the performance of the kayak, whereas canoes do not usually have as much of a problem. The placement of the gear within the kayak also impacts the performance of the boat as the center of gravity moves. Essential gear for multi-day trips includes fire <b>starting</b> <b>gear,</b> food and/or fishing line, and warm gear or a sleeping bag for the nights. Tents, sleeping pads, and cooking equipment are optional based on weight and space. This activity is comparable to mountaineering in scale and exposure, and mountaineering grade equipment is favored for its weight characteristics.|$|E
50|$|On larger diesel {{generators}} {{found in}} large shore installations and especially on ships, a pneumatic <b>starting</b> <b>gear</b> is used. The air motor is normally powered by compressed air at pressures of 10-30 bar. The air motor {{is made up}} of a center drum {{about the size of a}} soup can with four or more slots cut into it to allow for the vanes to be placed radially on the drum to form chambers around the drum. The drum is offset inside a round casing so that the inlet air for starting is admitted at the area where the drum and vanes form a small chamber compared to the others. The compressed air can only expand by rotating the drum, which allows the small chamber to become larger and puts another one of the cambers in the air inlet. The air motor spins much too fast to be used directly on the flywheel of the engine; instead a large gearing reduction, such as a planetary gear, is used to lower the output speed. A Bendix gear is used to engage the flywheel.|$|E
30|$|Usage {{of manual}} gearbox: Clutch wear {{is reduced by}} {{choosing}} a low <b>starting</b> <b>gear</b> and a correct handling of the clutch pedal. When cruising, the vehicle should be operated at a high gear.|$|E
50|$|Movement <b>started</b> <b>gearing</b> {{up after}} Kashmiri Youth backed by Pakistan opted for {{terrorism}} for seeking secession from India. Thousand of youth were martyred {{and subjected to}} enforced disappearances since the militancy started in Kashmir in 1989. However APHC continued its role of resolving Kashmir Dispute through dialogue.|$|R
50|$|More body {{variants}} {{were added}} {{over the next}} few years and in 1934 a Preselector gearbox was offered for £27 extra. The range was slimmed down in 1935 to the Monaco saloon, Kestrel streamlined saloon and Lynx four-seat tourer as the works <b>started</b> <b>gearing</b> up for production of the new 12 hp model.|$|R
50|$|The BC-1 of 1937 was North American's first combat aircraft; it {{was based}} on the GA-16. In 1940, like other manufacturers, North American <b>started</b> <b>gearing</b> up for war, opening {{factories}} in Columbus, Ohio, Dallas, Texas, and Kansas City, Kansas. North American ranked eleventh among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.|$|R
40|$|To {{realize a}} smooth and quick {{shift of the}} {{positive}} independent mechanical split path transmission (PIMSPT) equipped with automatic shifting control system (ASCS), the research on the feasibility of improving shift quality by dynamic and cooperative controlling engine, steering clutches, and brakes has been conducted. The shifting control method suited to <b>starting</b> <b>gear</b> of PIMSPT has been proposed. The control method is based on control parameters, such as the driving shaft speed and its derivative. The control laws of steering clutches and brakes are presented during each gear and stage of shifting. Bench and road test {{results show that the}} proposed shifting control method can not only shorten the shift time, but also decrease the jerk of shifting effectively...|$|E

This set-up has been enhanced so that a proper integrated water demand management could be achieved. Through such set-ups and through the integrated approach involving the use of legislative, economic and technical measures, and the involvement of the public in activities aimed at the rational use of water resources, the Water Management in Malta, after years of striving, has <b>started</b> <b>gearing</b> up. peer-reviewe...|$|R
25|$|Soon {{after the}} release of Have A Nice Day, the band <b>started</b> <b>gearing</b> up for the new 2005–2006 {{worldwide}} Have A Nice Day Tour. This tour, took the band to numerous stages and stadiums throughout the world. The tour was a significant commercial success, as the group played to 2,002,000 fans, and the tour grossed a total $191 million. The tour was the third-highest-grossing tour of 2006 taking in just over $131 million, just behind The Rolling Stones' A Bigger Bang World Tour and Madonna's Confessions Tour. On November 14, 2006, Bon Jovi were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame alongside James Brown and Led Zeppelin.|$|R

50|$|ETZ125/150 : Similar to the ETZ251 in {{appearance}} {{but with an}} updated 125/150 motor, now with the flat-topped cylinder head, five-speed gearbox and autolube. The design of the engine was still derived from the original DKW design, apparent from the concentric kick <b>start</b> and <b>gear</b> lever arrangement.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the player}} <b>starts</b> {{shifting}} <b>gears,</b> he can't downshift. But if the player shifts too soon, his engine will lug (work heavily); he will accelerate slowly and lose some time. It's tricky and takes practice, but the player's patience and perseverance {{will be rewarded}} with good times.|$|R

50|$|In the 1950s Ata <b>started</b> {{producing}} <b>gears</b> for domestically produced {{tractors and}} trams; {{pulp and paper}} industry applications came to selection in the 1960s. Marine industry grew a significant market segment in the 1970s. In the late 1980s Ata went to motor sports delivering spiral bevel gears for rally and Formula One, as well as American CART teams.|$|R
2500|$|Rambler {{also was}} an early pioneer in {{offering}} an automatic shift indicator sequence (P R N D2 D1 L, where if one selected [...] "D2", the car <b>started</b> in second <b>gear,</b> while [...] "1" [...] <b>started</b> in first <b>gear)</b> on its [...] "Flash-O-Matic" [...] transmission {{which is similar to}} today's [...] "PRNODSL", made mandatory for the 1968 model year cars, which required a neutral position between reverse and drive, while General Motors still offered a shift selector that had reverse immediately next to low gear (PNDSLR) well into the 1960s.|$|R

50|$|Small {{gas turbine}} engines, {{particularly}} turboshaft engines used in helicopters and cruise missile turbojets can be <b>started</b> by a <b>geared</b> hydraulic motor using oil pressure from a ground supply.|$|R
40|$|The <b>start</b> <b>gear</b> shaft is the {{key part}} of {{automobile}} starter, it is involute small module internal gear with addendum modification. It is step shaft with H/D> 6 in the outline. Because of the concentric degree demand of the internal gear and the outline step shaft is higher, length of below shaft is large and diameter is small, So plastic forming of the shaft is very difficult. Meeting the needs of markets and improving comprehensive function of automobiles, the high efficient precision forming technology method of single-step chipless-forming for internal gear tooth surface and external step shaft is put forward based on analysis, study and repeated test. In the same time, a set of high accuracy die with simple novel structure and long service life is designed and manufactured. The advantages of the method have been verified that utilization ratio of material and production efficiency is high. For this reason, the method is profitable reference for producing {{the same type of}} complex shape gear shaft...|$|R

50|$|Players {{take control}} of the main {{character}} who, {{at the start of the}} game, can be customized by choice of gender, appearance, name and starting class. There are 10 starting classes, ranging from knights and barbarians to thieves and mages. Each class has its own <b>starting</b> statistics, <b>gear,</b> weapons and type of magic used which all emphasize certain approaches to combat depending on the player's preference.|$|R
5000|$|Four-speed {{automatic}} transmission with a topographical sensor that monitored the vehicle's position (whether on an incline or decline) and gas pedal position. The result {{was an extraordinary}} capacity to [...] "hold back" [...] acceleration when coasting downhill and to maintain the S-Class' position without using the brake pedal after coming to a complete stop on a steep incline. The transmission was programmed to <b>start</b> in second <b>gear</b> so as to permit smooth, wheel spin free launches. Second <b>gear</b> <b>start</b> could be switched on and off in European models with a S/W switch to allow more performance orientated driving versus winter driving.|$|R
50|$|D2 and D1: These modes {{are found}} on older Ford {{transmissions}} (C6, etc.). In D1, all three gears are used, whereas in D2 the car <b>starts</b> in second <b>gear</b> and upshifts to third.|$|R
50|$|De Vivie's {{invention}} is in {{the museum}} of art and industry at St-Étienne. His friend, Albert Raimond, developed the idea and <b>started</b> the Cyclo <b>gear</b> company. Raimond, like Vivie, was fond of hilly rides.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gear</b> <b>started</b> his Warriors {{career with}} four tries in a match on his full debut - equalling the {{competition}} record - as Warriors punished Gran Parma {{and he continued}} to rack up the tries.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to pre-race gear checks, many race organizers also include on-course gear checks. This helps {{to ensure that}} teams that <b>start</b> with approved <b>gear,</b> compete with, and finish a race with that same gear.|$|R
5000|$|The first triple crank, or granny <b>gears,</b> <b>started</b> being sold. Ron Shephard, an {{engineer}} and {{founding member of the}} MBTC and Bicycle Victoria relentlessly promoted use of triple cranks to promote cycle touring among a wider audience.|$|R
5000|$|Two manual transmissions, a three-speed and three-speed with {{overdrive}} were available, {{as well as}} three-speed Ford-O-Matic automatic transmission. Starting in 1958, Cruise-O-Matic was added, {{which provided}} a second [...] "drive" [...] range ("D2"), allowing for an intermediate <b>gear</b> <b>start.</b>|$|R
50|$|Despite {{very closely}} {{resembling}} the American transmissions, GAZ's copies did have distinctive differences. First of all - their components were adopted to the metric units. Their gear ratios - to the car's engines. Both cars' handbrake actuated a central drum between the housing and the drive shaft, {{instead of the}} rear wheels. Thus a parking pawl was deemed redundant. Volga's transmission, based on the Fordomatic, required additional adaptation to the air-cooled torque converter, as it was driven by a 65 hp 4 cylinder engine. Controlled by a steering column mounted lever, it had four regimes: Зх-Н-Д-П (R-N-D-L). In Drive the car would start in second and automatically shift to third depending on throttle position (the valve was regulated by a lever linked to the accelerator pedal). A kick-down feature was also present. First gear could only be engaged manually in Low (though it could be engaged if the car was in motion, but would only donwshift) and was used for engine braking or rapid <b>starts.</b> <b>Gear</b> ratios were: 2.4 - 1.0 for the torque converter, 2.84 for first gear, 1.68 for second, third was direct and reverse was 1.72.|$|R
50|$|The first Tempo moped ever {{manufactured}} was the bicycle-like 1951 Tempo Handy. It {{looked like}} a bicycle, but where the pedals normally would be it carried a Sachs 49 cc, 1 hp engine with pedals and two gears, shifted with the left side twist grip. It had a three-litre gasoline tank and weighed around 28 kilograms. To start the moped, one put the engine in neutral (the <b>start</b> <b>gear)</b> and used the pedals as a kick starter. To pedal the bike, e.g. {{in the event of}} running out of petrol, the clutch lever was kept depressed by means of a small locking device and the transmission put in first or second gear. The engine was stopped by pressing a small switch that grounded the magneto. This moped sold well and was very cheap, but eventually more luxuries were needed and from 1957 Tempo made the rear suspensioned Comfort and Swing (same construction, the latter utilizing a swingarm front fork hence the name.) mopeds using the same engine before introducing the Corvette in 1960. Upgraded versions of the Sachs hand-shifted pedal engine had 1,6 hp and 3 gears.|$|R
50|$|For a {{long time}} navies used the heavy {{standard}} diving dress for underwater work. During and after World War II some of them <b>started</b> using frogman-type <b>gear</b> when frogman's kit became available. Later they started often using open-circuit scuba gear for work diving.|$|R
50|$|Neither {{system has}} a low range {{transfer}} box, although the ZF 9-HP features a special very low ratio first gear which is used only when the vehicle is off-road or otherwise needed. For on-road use, the vehicle will normally <b>start</b> in second <b>gear.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Replace gear. Only at {{this last}} step, purchase/borrow lighter weight <b>gear.</b> <b>Start</b> with the shelter, sleeping, and {{carrying}} systems (commonly called the Big Three) which might include a tent/tarp/bivy, sleeping bag/quilt, sleeping pad, and backpack).
