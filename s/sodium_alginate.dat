25|$|Alginate is a {{polysaccharide}} that readily forms chains; {{it can be}} cross-linked at its carboxylic {{groups with}} multivalent cations such as Cu2+, Ca2+, or Al3+ to form a more mechanically stable hydrogel. Calcium alginates form polymers that are both biocompatible and non-immunogenic and {{have been used in}} tissue engineering applications. However, they are unable to support longitudinally oriented growth, which is necessary for reconnection of the proximal end with its target. In order to overcome this problem, anisotropic capillary hydrogels (ACH) have been developed. They are created by superimposing aqueous solutions of <b>sodium</b> <b>alginate</b> with aqueous solutions of multivalent cations in layers. After formation, the electrolyte ions diffuse into the polymer solution layers, and a dissipative convective process causes the ions to precipitate, creating capillaries. The dissipative convective process results the opposition of diffusion gradients and friction between the polyelectrolyte chains. The capillary walls are lined with the precipitated metal alginate, while the lumen is filled with the extruded water.|$|E
25|$|Prang et al. (2006) {{assessed}} {{the capacity of}} ACH gels to promote directed axonal regrowth in the injured mammalian CNS. The multivalent ions used to create the alginate-based ACH gels were copper ions, whose diffusion into the <b>sodium</b> <b>alginate</b> layers created hexagonally structured anisotropic capillary gels. After precipitation, the entire gel was traversed by longitudinally oriented capillaries. The ACH scaffolds promoted adult NPC survival and highly oriented axon regeneration. This is the first instance of using alginates to produce anisotropic structured capillary gels. Future studies are need to study the long-term physical stability of the ACH scaffolds, because CNS axon regeneration can take many months; however, {{in addition to being}} able to provide long-term support the scaffolds must also be degradable. Of all the biological and synthetic biopolymers investigated by Prang et al. (2006), only agarose-based gels were able to compare with the linear regeneration caused by ACH scaffolds. Future studies will also need to investigate whether the ACH scaffolds allow for reinnervation of the target in vivo after a spinal cord injury.|$|E

Pluronic F 127 /alginate aqueous blend has the unique characteristic to be liquid at room condition and to form gel at physiological temperature. The proposed protocol is based on the blend injection on stent wall previously implanted in a flexible silicon pipe mimicking the coronary artery. Injected blend is warmed up until human body temperature achieving a soft gel, then it is reticulated by copper bivalent ions to obtain an hard gel. To test the gel paving resistance to erosion phenomena when it is exposed to fluid flux (i. e. blood flux) a dedicated device, (the Simulated Artery Device, SAD), was built to simulate the human circulatory apparatus. The SAD is an hydraulic circuit in which a buffer solution (at pH 7. 4) was fluxed by a peristaltic pump through the pipe hosting the covered stent. Erosion tests were performed monitoring, by gravimetric and spectrophotometric methods, the residual mass anchored to stent mesh after given times.

However, the pericapsular fibrotic overgrowth restricts long-term survival of graft and thus their potential clinical application. It is generally believed that protein adsorption {{onto the surface of}} implanted devices is the first event after contact of body fluids [1] and that the adsorbed protein layer controls further biological reactions [2]. Recent studies [3] have recognized that surface topography could affect protein adsorption. In this work, the influence of alginate and chitosan on the surface topography of ACA microcapsule was evaluated and the effect of surface roughness on protein adsorption was analyzed. The surface roughness was monitored using SEM. Bovine fibrinogen (Fgn, 340 kDa) was used for adsorption test, for fibrinogen is relevant to blood coagulation. The adsorption experiment was carried out by gently shaking Fgn solution of known concentration containing pre-weighed microcapsules at 37 Â± 0. 5 oC for 24 hours. Then, the Fgn solution without any microcapsules was collected and the remaining concentration of Fgn was assayed by the Bradford method. The results showed that alginate viscosity greatly affected the surface roughness of ACA microcapsule. Microcapsules made of low-viscosity <b>sodium</b> <b>alginates</b> had smoother membranes. The surface roughness was also influenced by the chitosan solution concentration. Microcapsules made of chitosans with concentration of 0. 25 % (w/v) had smoother topographical membrane surface than that of 0. 5 % (w/v). But the degree of deacetylation and molecular weight of chitosan had little effect on the surface roughness. In each case, the amount of adsorbed of fibrinogen was smaller for microcapsules with smoother membrane. It can be concluded that both alginate viscosity and chitosan solution concentration influence the surface roughness of ACA microcapsules, in turn, the surface roughness make protein adsorption increase. ä¸­å½ç§å­¦...|$|R
