2500|$|Guiteau became {{something}} of a media sensation during his entire trial for his bizarre behavior, which included him frequently cursing and insulting the judge, most of the witnesses, the prosecution, and even his defense team, as well as formatting his testimony in epic poems which he recited at length, and soliciting legal advice from random spectators in the audience via passed notes. He dictated an autobiography to the New York Herald, ending it with a personal ad for [...] "a nice Christian lady under 30 years of age". He was oblivious to the American public's hatred of him, even after he was almost assassinated twice himself. He frequently <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> at spectators and reporters {{in and out of}} the courtroom, seemingly happy to be the center of attention for once in his life.|$|E

60|$|She {{left him}} puzzled but relieved. Next morning {{he stood on}} the {{platform}} of the Grand Trunk station, and Evelyn, leaning on the rails of a vestibule, <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> her hand as the train rolled away.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Keller <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> his hand. [...] "You can do {{what you}} like with your own necklace, my dear," [...] he said. [...] "When I have written a line to my sister, perhaps I may follow you, and admire my daughter-in-law in all her grandeur." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Caryll, imperturbable outwardly, {{but very}} {{ill at ease}} within, <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> the {{delicate}} hand that appeared through the heavy ruffle at his wrist. [...] "Madam, indeed--ah--your ladyship goes very fast. You leap so at conclusions for which no grounds can exist. His lordship is so overwrought--as well he may be, alas!--that he cares not before whom he speaks. Is it not plainly so?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I'm an abuse, I know,' Herbert answered, <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> <b>waving</b> {{his hand}} gracefully. 'I at once admit it.

6000|$|She {{had often}} {{wondered}} what the brook sang, and tried to catch the words {{it seemed to be}} calling to her. But she never quite understood till this day, for when she came to the bridge and saw her friends--blue-bird, squirrel, and dragon-fly--waiting for her, she <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> her hand to them, and just at that moment she heard the song of the brook quite plainly,-- ...|$|E
60|$|The Kid seldom smiled; but he <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> his hat {{when he saw}} her. He dismounted, and {{his girl}} sprang into his arms. The Kid looked at her fondly. His thick, black hair clung to {{his head like a}} {{wrinkled}} mat. The meeting brought a slight ripple of some undercurrent of feeling to his smooth, dark face that was usually as motionless as a clay mask.|$|E
60|$|As {{she rolled}} away, {{the sun came}} out, and looking back, she saw it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen. They saw it also, and <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> their hands, {{and the last thing}} she beheld as she turned the corner was the four bright faces, and behind them like a bodyguard, old Mr. Laurence, {{faithful}} Hannah, and devoted Laurie.|$|E

5000|$|Critics gave differing {{opinions}} on the music <b>and</b> lyrics of <b>Smile</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wave.</b> When reviewing the album's music, the Calgary Herald said the album went for the [...] "rock jugular from start to finish", though the Toronto Star called the Headstones' work [...] "a murky, steaming cauldron of pungent rock 'n' roll".|$|R
60|$|The {{verdict was}} greeted with loud applause by a court in which McMurdo saw many {{familiar}} faces. Brothers of the lodge <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>waved.</b> But there were others who sat with compressed lips and brooding eyes as the men filed out of the dock. One of them, a little, dark-bearded, resolute fellow, put the thoughts of himself and comrades into words as the ex-prisoners passed him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where in thunder is she?" [...] growled Tom, {{walking off}} in high dudgeon. The quick tap of feet behind him made him turn {{in time to}} see a fresh-faced little girl running down the long station, and looking as if she rather liked it. As she <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> her bag at him, he stopped and waited for her, saying to himself, [...] "Hullo! I wonder if that 's Polly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The man, who, obviously, did not understand, <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> his whip.

[...] "No, go on," [...] till the man gave it up in despair, and the yellow-wheeled chariot {{continued}} to roll between the tall, flat-fronted shuttered houses and plane-tree avenues--a little Flying Dutchman of a cab.|$|E

6000|$|Then {{she drove}} away, <b>smiling</b> <b>and</b> <b>waving</b> {{her hand to}} the old lady at her window; but {{the last thing she}} saw as she left the well-beloved lane, was David going slowly up the path, with Kitty close beside him, talking busily.

6000|$|... "Good-bye, Sir Charles. Give my love to Lady Brandon, and Agatha, and {{the dear}} children; and {{thanks so much}} for a very pleasant--" [...] Here the train moved off, and Sir Charles, melting, <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> his hat until he caught sight of Trefusis looking back at him with a grin which seemed, under the circumstances, so Satanic, that he stopped as if petrified {{in the midst of his}} gesticulations, and stood with his arm out like a semaphore.|$|E
60|$|As {{the last}} words were sung, right before her eyes she saw a tiny {{creature}} swinging on the rose that stood there in a vase,--a lovely elf, with wings like a butterfly, a gauzy dress, and a star on her forehead. She <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> her hand as she slowly rose and fluttered away into the sunshine, till she vanished from sight, leaving May with the magic bracelet on her arm, and the happy thought that at last she had really seen a fairy.|$|E
6000|$|Christie <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> {{her hand}} to him, showed him his wedding roses still on her breast, and bore up as gallantly as he, {{resolved}} that his last impression of her should be a cheerful one. But {{when it was all}} over, and nothing remained but the trampled street, the hurrying crowd, the bleak November sky, when Mrs. Wilkins sat sobbing on the steps like Niobe with her children scattered about her, then Christie's heart gave way, and she hid her face on Mr. Power's shoulder for a moment, all her ardor quenched in tears as she cried within herself: ...|$|E
60|$|So long as Mr Pecksniff was in sight, {{and turned}} his head at {{intervals}} to salute him, Montague stood in the road <b>smiling,</b> <b>and</b> <b>waving</b> his hand. But when his new partner had disappeared, and this show was no longer necessary, {{he sat down on}} the stile with looks so altered, that he might have grown ten years older in the meantime.|$|R
60|$|They {{always looked}} back before turning the corner, for {{their mother was}} always at the window to nod <b>and</b> <b>smile,</b> <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> her hand to them. Somehow {{it seemed as if}} they couldn't have got through the day without that, for {{whatever}} their mood might be, the last glimpse of that motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine.|$|R
2500|$|When Chris MacNeil gives Father Dyer Father Karras' medal, {{he gives}} {{it back to}} her and says [...] "I think you should keep it", as {{depicted}} in the novel and instead of simply keeping it as in the original version.

6000|$|... 'I {{take the}} gage {{as it is}} meant,' said Sidney, putting a knee to the ground, and kissing the {{trembling}} fingers, ere he handed her into the carriage. He <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> his hand as he met her earnest eyes. One bow contained {{a scrap of paper}} pricked with needle-holes. Sidney would not have made out those pricks for the whole world, even had he been able to do more than hastily secure the token, before the unhappy King, with a paroxysm of violent interjections, demanded of him whether the Queen of England, woman though she were, ever were so beset, and never allowed a moment to herself; then, without giving time for an answer, he flung away to his cabinet, and might be heard pacing up and down there in a tempest of perplexity. He came forth only to order his horse, and desire M. de Sauve and a few grooms to be ready instantly to ride with him. His face was full of pitiable perplexity--the smallest obstacle was met with a savage oath; and he was evidently in all the misery of a weak yet passionate nature, struggling with impotent violence against a yoke that evidently mastered it.|$|E

5000|$|Only {{sporadic}} {{work was}} done on the Kinetoscope for much of 1890 as Dickson concentrated on Edison's unsuccessful venture into ore milling—between May and November, no expenses at all were billed to the lab's Kinetoscope account. By early 1891, however, Dickson, his new chief assistant, William Heise, and another lab employee, Charles Kayser, had succeeded in devising a functional strip-based film viewing system. In the new design, whose mechanics were housed in a wooden cabinet, a loop of horizontally configured 19 mm (3/4 inch) film ran around a series of spindles. The film, with a single row of perforations engaged by an electrically powered sprocket wheel, was drawn continuously beneath a magnifying lens. An electric lamp shone up from beneath the film, casting its circular-format images onto the lens and thence through a peephole atop the cabinet. As described by Robinson, a rapidly spinning shutter [...] "permitted {{a flash of light}} so brief that each frame appeared to be frozen. This rapid series of apparently still frames appeared, thanks to the persistence of vision phenomenon, as a moving image." [...] The lab also developed a motor-powered camera, the Kinetograph, capable of shooting with the new sprocketed film. To govern the intermittent movement of the film in the camera, allowing the strip to stop long enough so each frame could be fully exposed and then advancing it quickly (in about 1/460 of a second) to the next frame, the sprocket wheel that engaged the strip was driven by an escapement disc mechanism—the first practical system for the high-speed stop-and-go film movement that would be the foundation for the next century of cinematography.On May 20, 1891, the first public demonstration of a prototype Kinetoscope was given at the laboratory for approximately 150 members of the National Federation of Women's Clubs. The New York Sun described what the club women saw in the [...] "small pine box" [...] they encountered:In the top of the box was a hole perhaps an inch in diameter. As they looked through the hole they saw the picture of a man. It was a most marvelous picture. It bowed and <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> its hands and took off its hat with the most perfect naturalness and grace. Every motion was perfect....The man was Dickson; the little movie, approximately three seconds long, is now referred to as Dickson Greeting. On August 24, three detailed patent applications were filed: the first for a [...] "Kinetographic Camera", the second for the camera as well, and the third for an [...] "Apparatus for Exhibiting Photographs of Moving Objects". In the first Kinetograph application, Edison stated, [...] "I have been able to take with a single camera and a tape-film as many as forty-six photographs per second...but I do not wish to limit the scope of my invention to this high rate of speed...since with some subjects a speed as low as thirty pictures per second or even lower is sufficient." [...] Indeed, according to the Library of Congress archive, based on data from a study by historian Charles Musser, Dickson Greeting and at least two other films made with the Kinetograph in 1891 were shot at 30 frames per second or even slower. The Kinetoscope application also included a plan for a stereoscopic film projection system that was apparently abandoned.|$|E

In 2002, the Phillips family {{revealed}} that Jeanne's mother, Pauline, had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Tim Johnson, a medical journalist for ABC News, wrote in February 2010 that Pauline resides with her husband, Morton, in Minnetonka, Minnesota and has caregivers. Pauline's son, Eddie, said: [...] We call them angels because they are who are with her 24/7. She watches a lot of television. She loves visitors. She loves to get out.
