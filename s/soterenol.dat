40|$|The {{effects of}} modifying the {{chemical}} structure of Th 1165 a on its selectivity in vitro for the Î²-adrenoreceptors of guinea-pig trachea have been examined. The mean log EC 50 s of the compounds on guinea-pig trachea and atria (rate) {{were used as}} estimates of potency. The alternative racemic from of Th 1165 a, i. e. Th 1179, was less potent on trachea but was only slightly less selective. Removal of the p-hydroxyl from the N-substituted phenylisopropyl group of Th 1165 a markedly reduced both its potency on trachea and its selectivity. Me 506, an N-tertiary butyl homologue of Th 1165 a, was equipotent with salbutamol on trachea and was of equivalent selectivity. It was more selective than Th 1165 a. The analogue in which the resorcinol nucleus of Th 1165 a {{is replaced by a}} catechol nucleus, i. e. Cc- 25, was the most potent compound on the trachea but it was less selective than Th 1165 a. Salbutamol and <b>soterenol,</b> which were included in the study for comparative purposes, were both selective for trachea but an accurate estimate of their mean log EC 50 s on atria was difficult to obtain because the mean maximum increase in atrial rate was 58 % for salbutamol and 52 % for <b>soterenol.</b> Protokylol was the only drug examined which was equipotent on trachea and atria. Isoprenaline was not equipotent and higher concentrations of isoprenaline were required to produce half maximal responses of trachea than of atria. The possible reasons for the in vitro selectivity of the drugs examined for trachea or atria are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The chronotropic {{responsiveness}} to norepinephrine (NE) and isoproterenol (ISO) was determined in right atria isolated from rats submitted to repeated escapable or inescapable foot-shock. Significant postjunctional supersensitivity to ISO, {{but not to}} NE, was observed in both groups. No {{significant change in the}} pA 2 value of metoprolol (a selective beta 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist) was detected. However, a decrease of the maximum response to <b>soterenol,</b> a partial agonist at beta 1 -adrenoceptors, occurred only after inescapable foot-shock. The enhanced sensitivity to ISO was abolished by butoxamine (a selective beta 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist) and accompanied by a marked increase in the pA 2 Value of this antagonist. We conclude that the ability to control the shock prevented the down-regulation of the pacemaker beta 1 -adrenoceptors but not the increased participation of beta 2 -adrenoceptors in the response of the rat sinoatrial node to catecholamines after repeated foot-shock...|$|E
40|$|The potent alpha-adrenoreceptor {{blocking}} agent, azapetine, {{has been}} catalytically reduced with tritium gas to form [3 H]dihydroazapetine. [3 H]Dihydroazapetine retains significant ability to block alpha-adrenoreceptors {{and has been}} used as a ligand to study the receptor in a subcellular fraction containing membrane fragments from rat vas deferens. Specific binding of [3 H]dihydroazapetine rapidly reaches equilibrium and is also reversible and saturable with a dissociation constant similar to that determined pharmacologically. The binding capacity is approximately 40 pmol/mg of protein. All alpha-adrenergic blockers tested were able to inhibit specific binding. High concentrations of alprenolol, atropine, or chlorpheniramine had no effect. In addition, all alpha-adrenergic agonists of the imidazoline class inhibit binding in low concentrations, whereas <b>soterenol</b> or carbamylcholine did not. There is good correlation (r= 0. 84) between blockade or stimulation of the receptor in intact tissues and inhibition of binding of [3 H]dihydroazapetine to the subcellular fraction. These findings suggest that the fraction contains alpha-adrenoreceptor-related proteins. Alpha-adrenergic agonists structurally related to norepinephrine caused a stereoselective increase in binding in favor of the (-) -isomer, possibly reflecting an allosteric interaction at a different binding site on the receptor protein. The possibility of two different modes of binding for structurally dissimilar agonists is suggested...|$|E
40|$|Typescript. Bibliography: leaves 132 - 142. xii, 142 l illusStudies were {{performed}} to assess {{the role of the}} sympathetic nervous system in regulating the metabolism of an administered load of potassium in anesthetized cats. A nonlethal intravenous infusion of KCl (10 mg/Kg/min for 10 minutes) produced effects indicative of a sympatho-adrenal discharge; these effects included an increase in heart rate, a rise in blood pressure and an increase in blood glucose. The increases in heart rate and blood pressure were abolished by acute adrenalectomy and by pretreatment with reserpine. Propranolol pretreatment antagonized the heart rate but not the blood pressure response associated' with the KCl infusion. Acute adrenalectomy as well as pretreatment with reserpine, propranolol and 1 -(4 'methylphenyl) - 2 - isopropylamino-propanol (H 35 / 25) increased the susceptibility of the animals to KCl intoxication; thus, a significant number of fatalities occurred in these animals when they received a rate of KCl infusion (10 mg/Kg/min) which produced no deaths in intact, non-pretreated controls. The fatalities were correlated with higher plasma K+ values than in the controls. Butoxamine pretreatment did not significantly increase the susceptibility to KCl intoxication from a mortality standpoint but did significantly increase the hyperkalemic response to the KCl infusion. The above suggested that the sympatho-adrenal system has an important attenuating effect on the rise in plasma K+ produced by infusion of the ion. Chlorisondamine and bretylium pretreatment failed to increase the susceptibility of the animals to KCl intoxication. Evidence is presented which suggests that these latter two agents may not effectively antagonize the sympatho-adrenal discharge elicited by KCl infusion. The i. v. infusion of epinephrine completely protected animals against an infusion of KCl (12 mg/Kg/min for 10 minutes) which was lethal to most control animals. Plasma K+ data showed that the protection was related to an ability of epinephrine to attenuate the hyperkalemia produced by infusion of the ion. Similar effects on mortality and plasma K+ were produced by isoproterenol (a beta adrenergic stimulant) but not by phenylephrine (an alpha adrenergic stimulant). The epinephrine-induced protection against death due to KCl infusion as well as the plasma K+ lowering effect were abolished by propranolol and sotalol (beta blocking agents) but not by phenoxybenzamine (an alpha blocking agent). Acute nephrectomy or pancreatectomy did not affect the protective action of epinephrine. An infusion of glucose (which produced blood glucose levels higher than those in the epinephrine series) did not protect against KGI intoxication. The K+ content of skeletal and cardiac muscle in animals given an infusion of KCl was significantly greater in animals infused with epinephrine than in controls infused with saline. The foregoing suggests that epinephrine protected against KCl intoxication in these experiments by virtue of a direct beta stimulant action which promoted the entry of K+ into cells and thus prevented plasma K+ from reaching a lethal level. Studies were also performed to determine the "subtype" of beta receptor subserving the above effect on K+. Butoxamine and H 35 / 25 were very effective in antagonizing the effects of epinephrine in potassium intoxication. Practolol, which blocked the cardiostimulant effect of epinephrine, did not block the protective effect or attenuation of hyperkalemia during KCI infusion by this catecholamine. Salbutamol and <b>soterenol</b> had effects similar to epinephrine, but l-isopropylamino- 3 -(2 -thiazoloxy) 2 -propanol (ITP) failed to protect against KCl intoxication. The above spectrum of agonism and antagonism would be consistent with a beta- 2 type of adrenergic receptor according to the Lands classification, although the adequacy of this classification in delineating the beta receptors found in different tissues has been questioned...|$|E
