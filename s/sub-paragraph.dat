25|$|The Russian {{copyright}} law of 1993 covered works first disclosed on Russian territory, {{as well as}} undisclosed works that existed in objective form within Russia, regardless of the nationality of the author. It also covered works of Russian authors that were first disclosed outside of Russia or that, if undisclosed, existed only abroad. Foreign works (i.e., works not disclosed in Russia or not existing there of an author {{who did not have}} Russian citizenship) were subject to the Russian {{copyright law}} according to the provisions of the international treaties Russia was a member of. In 2004, article 5, which laid down these definitions, was amended with a new <b>sub-paragraph</b> 5(4) to cover also foreign works that were still copyrighted in their foreign country of origin, but had never been copyrighted in Russia. Such restored copyrights on foreign works were limited to at most the copyright term they enjoyed in the foreign country.|$|E

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} {{policies and}} measures (SD-PAMs) are an approach to stimulating action on climate change mitigation in developing countries. Instead of starting from explicit climate targets, the approach deliberately sets out to start from development objectives. This strategic approach taps into the primary motivation for developing countries, namely development. Defining more sustainable pathways to meet given development objectives has significant climate co-benefits. These co-benefits are by now broadly accepted (IPCC 2007, 2001 b; Robinson et al. 2006; Winkler et al. 2006; Szklo et al. 2005; Munasinghe & Swart 2005; Baumert & Winkler 2005; Bradley et al. 2005; IISD 2005), {{the question is how}} to capture these benefits in the multi-lateral climate regime. A new strategic approach is needed, and SD-PAMs offers one possible approach. This approach provides a means to identify ‘nationally appropriate mitigation actions by developing country Parties in the context of sustainable development, supported and enabled by technology, financing and capacity-building, in a measurable, reportable and verifiable manner’ (UNFCCC 2007). Sustainable development is part of core balance between <b>sub-paragraphs</b> 1 b(i) and 1 b(ii), in that mitigation actions by developing countries are qualified as being ‘in the context of sustainable development’...|$|R

40|$|Since ancient times, many {{cultures}} worldwide found out independently that the topical administration of some photoactive natural products (mainly extracted from plants) followed {{by exposure to}} sunlight, might be an effective treatment of some skin diseases, thus accidently giving birth to the so-called photochemotherapy. In the attempt to resemble nature by exploiting its teaching, {{during the last two}} centuries, scientists tried to rationalize this knowledge in order to develop more effective therapeutic strategies and to understand in depth the mechanisms of action involved, expanding the potential application of this therapy to pathologies other than skin diseases, such as some types of tumors. In this paper we aim at giving an overview on results achieved to date on state-of-the-art photochemotherapy related to the treatment of cancer. The script is organized in three sections. Subsequent to a general introduction describing the origin and basic principles of photochemotherapy, the first section deals with the issue concerning the choice of the proper light sources for each type of therapeutic application, stressing the technological advances in the field (e. g. fiber optics). The second and the third sections provide an overview of the two clinically-established phototherapies to date, that is, PUVA photochemotherapy and PDT, respectively. Both sections are further subdivided into <b>sub-paragraphs</b> emphasizing specific relate topics such as principles and applications, employed light sources, and available data concerning anticancer activity. The third section also provides examples of non-conventional metal-based photosensitizers for PDT...|$|R
