5|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} on the storm in eight counties in North Carolina to determine the cost of evacuation for hurricanes, and included 1,029 households. Another study was performed regarding the actions taken during Hurricane Bonnie evacuations in the state. Tourists were interviewed, and it was found that 90% of vacationers who were threatened by the hurricane evacuated, of which 56% went home, 3% <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> public shelters, 22% stayed with friends or relatives, 3% <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> hotels and motels, and 16% stayed elsewhere. In total, 58% stayed within North Carolina, 12% went to Virginia, 6% relocated to South Carolina, and 24% <b>stayed</b> <b>in</b> other regions. Most of the evacuees left on August 25; 80% left with their own vehicles, and 18% used rental transportation. Officials in the state opened an estimated 100 shelters to accommodate the evacuating tourists and residents.|$|E

40|$|Convention travel {{has been}} growing rapidly {{throughout}} the world {{in recent years and}} becoming a critical component of the hospitality and travel industry. Hosting of conventions, especially international conventions, can be used by host countries as part of a strategic marketing plan to publicize modern development, traditional culture, and tourism resources. It also stimulates economic growth in the hosting country. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the differences between the expenditures of delegates <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> hotels and delegates not <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> hotels in each category. It was expected that most of delegates <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> hotels were foreigners and most of delegates not <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> hotels were local people. A questionnaire was developed by using the categories of the 1993 IACVB Convention Income Survey as a base and executed in Taiwan. The subsequent data allowed the comparison between expenditures of the delegates <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> hotels and the delegates not <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> hotels. Overall, the average spending per delegate was US$ 621. 62 in this sample study. The delegate <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> a hotel spent an average of 6. 79 times the amount the delegate not <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> a hotel in this 4 day meeting. Recommendations for further studies were suggested. Additional research would help Taiwan determine the economic impact of the convention industry on the local economy in the future. Such research would also serve as a base for the convention industry positioning itself to receive future government support...|$|R
