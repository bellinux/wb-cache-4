5|$|By March, front-runner John McCain {{had secured}} enough pledged delegates to {{guarantee}} that he would win the nomination, and Romney and Huckabee had both formally withdrawn from the race. Paul, who had won no state primaries, {{knew that it was}} now mathematically impossible for him to win the nomination, as he had captured only 20â€“ 40 pledged delegates compared to more than 1,191 for McCain, yet he refused to concede the race and said that it was unlikely that he would ultimately endorse McCain. Over the next few weeks, Paul's supporters clashed with establishment Republicans at several county and <b>state</b> <b>party</b> conventions over <b>state</b> <b>party</b> rules, the party platforms, and selection of delegates for the national convention. In one of the more dramatic moments, Nevada's <b>state</b> <b>party</b> leaders, outmaneuvered by Paul supporters at the state nominating convention, resorted to the highly unusual measure of prematurely and abruptly shutting down the convention before selecting national delegates, with a plan to reconvene at a later date.|$|E
5|$|Minton ran for {{re-election}} to his Senate seat in 1940. McNutt was challenging Roosevelt for the Presidential nomination, forcing Minton {{to choose between}} the administration and his allies in the <b>state</b> <b>party.</b> Minton sided with Roosevelt, which cost him McNutt's and the Indiana Democratic Party machine's support in his re-election bid.|$|E
5|$|After the {{convention}} many Conservative Democrats, though not happy at Tillman's victory, acknowledged him {{as head of}} the <b>state</b> <b>party.</b> Those who submitted to Tillman's rule included Hampton and Butler, the state's two U.S. senators. In his campaign, Tillman promoted support for Clemson, establishment of a state women's college, reapportionment of the state legislature (then dominated by the lowcountry counties), and ending the influence of corporation lawyers in that body.|$|E

5|$|Becoming {{popular among}} the party {{leadership}} during his {{two years as}} commissioner, Minton was encouraged by party leaders {{to run for the}} United States Senate in 1934. At the state Democratic Party Convention he ran against Earl Peters, {{a former chairman of the}} <b>state</b> <b>party.</b> With the support of McNutt, Minton won the nomination on the third ballot with 827 votes to Peters' 586.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December 2010, a {{week after}} the ICC Prosecutor {{announced}} the individuals he was seeking to prosecute, the Kenyan National Assembly passed a motion seeking to withdraw Kenya as a <b>State</b> <b>Party</b> to the Rome Statute, the treaty which established the International Criminal Court. The motion, which was introduced by Assembly Member Isaac Ruto had previously been thrown out of the National Assembly by Deputy Speaker Farah Maalim who ruled it was unconstitutional; however an amended version was introduced the following day and passed. During the debate, the Minister for Energy Kiraitu Murungi claimed the ICC was a colonialist, imperialist court. This motion did not itself affect Kenya's status as a <b>State</b> <b>Party</b> to the Rome Statute, but rather obliges ministers to move to repeal Kenya's International Crimes Act which ratified the Rome Statute and made necessarily changes to Kenyan's criminal code. In February 2011, Kenya appealed to the United Nations Security Council, asking it to defer the trials at The Hague. Some critics in Kenya have also questioned the constitutionality of the Rome Statute, arguing that it is incompatible with the Constitution of Kenya, which was passed by a referendum in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Governor had a 61percent job {{approval}} rating in public polls after his initial fiscal actions in 2003, although {{his approval rating}} subsequently declined, driven in part by his frequent out-of-state travel. Romney's approval rating stood at 34percent in November 2006, ranking 48th of the 50 U.S. governors. Dissatisfaction with Romney's administration and the weak condition of the Republican <b>state</b> <b>party</b> were among several factors contributing to Democrat Deval Patrick's 20-point win over Republican Kerry Healey, Romney's lieutenant governor, in the 2006 Massachusetts gubernatorial election.|$|E

5|$|A Republican Party official, Tongue {{served on}} the party's state central {{committee}} from 1886 to 1896. In 1890, {{he was elected to}} the post of chairman for the Republican state convention and followed that position as president of the <b>state</b> <b>party</b> from 1892 to 1894. In 1892, Oregon received a second congressional district, and Tongue served as the Republican party's chairman for the district until 1896. Also in 1892, Tongue served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and served as the vice president of the Oregon delegation to the convention in 1894.|$|E
5|$|After resigning as <b>state</b> <b>party</b> chairman, McNary {{prepared}} {{to campaign for}} a full term in the Senate. He faced Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives Robert N. Stanfield in the May 1918 Republican primary. McNary defeated Stanfield 52,546 to 30,999. In the November general election, he defeated a friend and former governor, Oswald West, 82,360 to 64,303, to win a full, six-year term in the Senate. Meanwhile, Frederick W. Mulkey won the election to replace McNary and finished Lane's original term, which would end in January 1919, and Mulkey took office on November 6, 1918, replacing McNary in that seat.|$|E
5|$|After the campaign, Daniel {{continued}} his temperance activism, remaining {{head of the}} <b>state</b> <b>party</b> until 1888. He organized the Prohibition Camp Meeting association in 1889, which later purchased land in Glyndon, Maryland for their meetings. He also kept up his law practice, training many law students in his office, including Orlando Franklin Bump, who also serve as Daniel's law partner for several years. He {{also served as a}} trustee of Dickinson College, his alma mater, and in other charitable and religious activities, including the Young Men's Christian Association. On October 13, 1897, he died suddenly of heart failure at his home in Mount Washington, Baltimore, survived by his wife and their adopted son, Clarence Adreon. He was buried at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore.|$|E

50|$|The <b>states</b> <b>parties</b> to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court {{are those}} {{sovereign}} {{states that have}} ratified, or have otherwise become party to, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The Rome Statute is the treaty that established the International Criminal Court, an international court that has jurisdiction over certain international crimes, including genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes that are committed by nationals of <b>states</b> <b>parties</b> or within the territory of <b>states</b> <b>parties.</b> <b>States</b> <b>parties</b> are legally obligated to co-operate with the Court when it requires, such as in arresting and transferring indicted persons or providing access to evidence and witnesses. <b>States</b> <b>parties</b> are entitled to participate and vote in proceedings of the Assembly of <b>States</b> <b>Parties,</b> which is the Court's governing body.

5|$|Anti-Masonry {{was still}} strong in Western New York {{though it was}} petering out nationally, and when the Anti-Masons did not {{nominate}} him {{for a second term}} in 1834, Fillmore declined the Whig nomination, seeing that the two parties would split the anti-Jackson vote and elect the Democrat. Despite Fillmore's departure from office, he was a rival for <b>state</b> <b>party</b> leadership with Seward, the unsuccessful 1834 Whig gubernatorial candidate. Fillmore spent his time out of office building his law practice and boosting the Whig Party, which gradually absorbed most of the Anti-Masons. By 1836, Fillmore was confident enough of anti-Jackson unity that he accepted the Whig nomination for Congress. Democrats, led by their presidential candidate, Vice President Martin Van Buren, were victorious nationwide and in Van Buren's home state of New York, but Western New York voted Whig and sent Fillmore back to Washington.|$|E
5|$|As the 1880 {{elections}} approached, Randall had two goals: {{to increase}} his control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, and to nominate Tilden for president. His efforts at the former in 1875 had been successful, but Senator William Wallace's faction was again growing powerful. If he wanted to hold the Speakership, {{as well as to}} wield influence in the next presidential canvass, Randall believed he must have a united <b>state</b> <b>party</b> behind him. To that end, Randall spent much of his time outside of Congress travelling around his home state to line up support at the state convention in 1880. Some of his allies' enthusiasm backfired against him, however, after McMullen and some supporters broke up an anti-Randall meeting in Philadelphia's 5th ward with such violence that one man was left dead.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Marshall {{declined}} his party's {{nomination to}} run for Congress. He did hint to <b>state</b> <b>party</b> leaders {{that he would be}} interested in running for Indiana governor in the 1908 election. He soon gained the support of several key labor unions, and was endorsed by Louis Ludlow, a reporter for the Indianapolis Star. Despite this support, Marshall was a dark horse candidate at the state convention. Initially, Thomas Taggart, Indiana Democratic Party boss, did not support him because of Marshall's support of prohibition. Taggart wanted the party to nominate anti-prohibitionist Samuel Ralston, but the prohibitionist and anti-Taggart factions united with Marshall's supporters. Taggart swung Ralston's delegates in support of Marshall to oppose L. Ert Slack, a temperance candidate, giving Marshall the votes he needed to win the nomination.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, the {{divisions}} in the <b>state</b> <b>party</b> proved ruinous for Randall's chances at the Speaker's chair. Instead, the Democrats decided on Michael C. Kerr of Indiana, who was elected. Randall was instead named chairman of the Appropriations Committee. In that post, he focused on reducing the government's spending, and cut the budget by $30,000,000, despite opposition from the Republican Senate. Kerr's health was fragile, and he was often absent from sessions, but Randall refused {{to take his place}} as speaker on a temporary basis, preferring to concentrate on his appropriations work. Kerr and Randall began to work more closely together through 1876, but Kerr died in August of that year, leaving the Speakership vacant once again.|$|E
5|$|Long {{was elected}} to the United States Congress in the 1882 election, and served until 1889, declining to run for reelection in the 1888 election. In 1886, he was {{encouraged}} to stand for the Senate by Henry Cabot Lodge, although Lodge's support was apparently part of a ruse to test the strength of the <b>state</b> <b>party</b> leadership. Lodge withdrew his support at the last minute, throwing it instead to the incumbent Henry L. Dawes, and the legislature reelected Dawes to the seat. The incident cooled relations between Lodge and Long. In the wheeling and dealing that preceded the Senate election, Long was offered Democratic support by Butler, but refused, believing that such votes would be seen as tainted by an unsavory political deal.|$|E
5|$|When Minton {{returned}} home he reopened his law practice {{and decided to}} enter politics. He ran for office in Indiana's 3rd congressional district, but lost the Democratic primary, despite significant campaigning and his war record. He lost to John Ewing, 6,502 votes to 3,170, second place {{in a field of}} five candidates. After the loss, he briefly joined the Indiana law firm of Stonsenburg and Weathers, two politically active lawyers, before moving to Miami, Florida, where he joined another firm, Shutts & Bowen. In January 1928, he left the Miami practice and returned to Stonsenburg and Weathers. He attempted to secure the Democratic nomination to run for Congress in 1930, but was again defeated, this time by the former <b>state</b> <b>party</b> chairman Eugene B. Crowe.|$|E

5|$|With the ALP's {{governing}} bodies unwilling to reform themselves, Whitlam worked {{to build support}} for change among ordinary party members. He was successful in reducing union influence in the party, though he was never able to give the rank and file a direct vote in selecting the executive. The Victoria branch of the party had long been a problem; its executive was far {{to the left of the}} rest of the ALP, and had little electoral success. Whitlam was able to reconstruct the Victoria party organisation against the will of its leaders, and the reconstituted <b>state</b> <b>party</b> proved essential to victory in the 1972 election.|$|E
5|$|As Democrats {{took control}} of the House in 1875, Randall was {{considered}} among the candidates for Speaker of the House. Many in the caucus hesitated, however, believing Randall to be too close to railroad interests and uncertain on the money question. His leadership in the Salary Grab may have harmed him, as well. Randall was also occupied by an intra-party battle with William A. Wallace for control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. Wallace, who had been elected to the United States Senate in 1874, was weakened by rumors that he had taken bribes from the railroads while a member of the State Senate. Randall wanted control of the Democratic machine statewide, and the Wallace faction's vulnerability on the bribery rumors provided the opportunity. In January 1875, he had friends in the state legislature begin an investigation into Wallace's clique, which ultimately turned state Democratic leaders against the senator. At the state Democratic convention in September 1875, Randall (with the help of his old ally, Squire McMullen) triumphed, putting his men in control of the <b>state</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the 1920 Republican National Convention, most of {{the delegates}} were {{selected}} by <b>state</b> <b>party</b> conventions, not primaries. As such, the field was divided among many local favorites. Coolidge was one such candidate, and while he placed as high as sixth in the voting, the powerful party bosses running the convention, primarily the party's U.S. Senators, never considered him seriously. After ten ballots, the bosses and then the delegates settled on Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio as their nominee for president. When {{the time came to}} select a vice presidential nominee, the bosses also made and announced their decision on whom they wanted â€“ Sen. Irvine Lenroot of Wisconsin â€“ and then prematurely departed after his name was put forth, relying on the rank and file to confirm their decision. A delegate from Oregon, Wallace McCamant, having read Have Faith in Massachusetts, proposed Coolidge for vice president instead. The suggestion caught on quickly with the masses starving for an act of independence from the absent bosses, and Coolidge was unexpectedly nominated.|$|E
5000|$|Johan de Witt and his brother, Cornelis were {{leaders of}} the republican <b>States</b> <b>Party</b> in the United Provinces of the Netherlands. Although [...] "republican" [...] the <b>States</b> <b>Party</b> {{represented}} {{the interests of the}} rich merchant class. Under the de Witt brothers, the <b>States</b> <b>Party</b> had been in control of the government of the United Netherlands since 1650. In opposition, to the <b>States</b> <b>Party</b> was the Orangist Party, which supported the House of Orange-Nassau, descendants of William the Silent. While the Orangists tended to be pro-English in their foreign policy, the de Witt brothers and the <b>States</b> <b>Party</b> tended to be pro-French. [...] Consequently, when Louis XIV alarmed the de Witt brothers by the size of his territorial demands in the Spanish Netherlands, he was alienating his traditional friends among the Dutch. Thus, no deal dividing these territories was ever concluded by the two parties.|$|R

In other words, he did not find a reasonable basis to proceed against nationals of <b>state</b> <b>parties</b> on the basis of complicity in war crimes carried out by non <b>state</b> <b>parties.</b> However, this is not, as such, a finding that war crimes were not carried out by non <b>state</b> <b>parties.</b> The prosecutor did not express a conclusion on that matter since that was not within his competence.|$|R
