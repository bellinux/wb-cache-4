40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. In Asia skin {{lightening}} {{products have}} grown {{to be the best}} selling skin care products, whereas in the Western hemisphere, including Europe and North America, the main demand is for the treatment of age spots and skin even toning. For African and Asian women, skin lightening is part of their culture, as lighter skin signifies increased wealth and social status. It is believed that blending vitamin C, or its derivates, with kojic acid, or its esters, could synergistically inhibit melanin synthesis. Kojic acid dipalmitate was chosen over kojic acid, as better product stability is ensured without any colour instability problems. Since vitamin C is very unstable, especially in aqueous solution, <b>sodium</b> <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>phosphate,</b> as a stable vitamin C derivative, was used. In this study, kojic acid dipalmitate and <b>sodium</b> <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> were incorporated into both hydrous - and anhydrous formulations, in order to compare the stability of these actives in the various formulations that were developed and prepared. A hydrous - and anhydrous gel, a hydrous cream and anhydrous ointment, and a hydrous - and anhydrous stick were formulated. These formulations were subjected to stability testing over a three-month period and storage at three conditions, i. e. 5 "C, 25 °C + 60 % RH, and 40 °C + 75 % RH. Various stability tests, including HPLC analysis, pH, physical examination, viscosity, relative density, spreadability, penetration, preservative efficacy and membrane release studies were done on these formulations. HPLC analysis proved the kojic acid dipalmitate to be more stable overall in anhydrous formulations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Stratum corneum {{composition}} and structure limit cutaneous bioavailability of pharmaceutical and cosmetical agents. Electrically assisted transport {{can increase the}} rate and extent of delivery; moreover, it also enables the administration of polar and charged molecules into the skin. AIMS: The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of electrotreatment on skin permeability by measuring the cumulative delivery of caffeine and <b>sodium</b> <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>phosphate.</b> Furthermore, confocal microscopy was used to visualize the effect of electrotreatment on the penetration of calcein. METHODS: Porcine ear skin was used for the in vitro permeation studies, which involved application of either the caffeine or <b>sodium</b> <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> (NAP) containing gels using the roll-on supplied with the electrotreatment device. RESULTS: Electrotreatment increased the amount of caffeine and NAP in the skin. Enhancement factors (EF) for NAP of 7. 2 and 14. 9 were observed following 20 min of electrotreatment and either immediate sampling or a further 60 min of passive diffusion compared with passive diffusion for either 20 or 80 min. The effect on caffeine permeation was less significant (EF = 2. 1 for 20 min electrotreatment compared with passive diffusion for 20 min). The confocal microscopy images showed that electrotreatment significantly increased calcein permeation; fluorescence was observed deep into the viable epidermis-reaching depths of up to 60 to 80 microns.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharm.)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The skin, {{our main}} defence against harmful {{substances}} such as wind, dirt, bacteria and ultraviolet radiation has also the important functions of preventing water loss, regulating temperature and receiving external stimuli. Skin colour {{varies depending on}} racial background, sex and the season of the year due to the exposure to sunlight. Skin colour is primarily determined {{by the amount of}} melanin produced by the melanocytes. For this reason, research for the development of whitening products has focused on reducing melanin production in the melanocytes, rather than bleaching of the skin. Skin-whitening products have been widely used in the cosmetic field and clinic therapy. They either lighten the skin or depigment skin (treatment for abnormal hyperpigmentation of the skin such as freckles and melasma). Whitening agents, such as hydroquinone, kojic acid and ascorbic acid derivatives have shown efficacy in treatment of hyperpigmentation. In this study, <b>sodium</b> <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> and kojic acid were used as the active ingredients in skin lightening products. <b>Sodium</b> <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> acts as an in-vivo antioxidant, promotes collagen formation, and lightens the skin. It is a stable vitamin C derivate that protects the skin, promotes its development and improves its appearance. Kojic acid successfully fights age spots and pigmentation on face and body. The product development program started with a literature search and a preformulation study. Existing basic formulations were used and modified to incorporate both active ingredients in a variety of skin lightening products. Stability testing followed, based on the requirements of the South A 6 ican Medicine Control Council for new products. Six skin lightening products were formulated, i. e. two facial creams, a toner, a gel, a foam bath, and a soap. After formulation these products were tested for their stability over a period of three months at three different storage temperatures and humidity (5 ºC, 25 ºC + 60 % RH and 40 ºC + 75 % RH).

40|$|Ascorbic acid (AA), or vitamin C, {{is widely}} used in the pharmaceutical, {{cosmetic}} and food industries as an antioxidant and cosmetics containing AA have been gaining popularity {{in the last few}} years for the treatment of photoageing. To solve the problem of its low stability, some esters have been synthesised, such as magnesium <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> (MAP), also available encapsulated in collagen-based microspheres (EMAP). The aim of this research was to study the physical and chemical stability of O/W emulsions containing AA, MAP or EMAP, by rheological and HPLC analysis, respectively. These emulsions were stored at 25, 37 and 45 °C for 28 days and samples tested weekly during storage. It was concluded that all the formulations showed pseudoplastic behaviour. The presence of MAP provoked an initial rise in thixotropy. The formulation containing AA did not show any marked change in rheological behaviour. In the chemical analysis, the formulation with EMAP was more stable than those with MAP and AA. Hence, replacement of AA with EMAP in this cosmetic formulation may be a viable way to enhance the stability of the active principle. Keywords: Ascorbic acid.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the ability of lasers and microdermabrasion, both of which are skin resurfacing modalities, to enhance and control the in vitro skin permeation and deposition of vitamin C. The topical delivery of magnesium <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>phosphate,</b> the prodrug of vitamin C, was also examined in this study. All resurfacing techniques evaluated produced significant increases in the topical delivery of vitamin C across and/or into the skin. The erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) laser showed the greatest enhancement of skin permeation of vitamin C among the modalities tested. The laser fluence and spot size were found to play important parts in controlling drug absorption. An excellent correlation was observed in the Er:YAG laser fluence and transepidermal water loss, which is an estimation of skin disruption. Permeation of magnesium <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> was not enhanced by the Er:YAG laser. The CO 2 laser at a lower fluence promoted vitamin C permeation with no ablation of the stratum corneum or epidermal layers. Further enhancement was observed with the CO 2 laser at higher fluences, which was accompanied by a prominent ablation effect. Microdermabrasion ablated the stratum corneum layers with minimal disruption of the skin barrier properties according to transepidermal water loss levels. The flux and skin deposition of vitamin C across microdermabrasion-treated skin was approximately 20 -fold higher than that across intact skin.

Objective: We examined whether the ascorbic acid derivative zinc ascorbate has superoxide dismutase (SOD) -like activity. SOD is an enzyme that controls reactive oxygen species production. In addition, the in vitro antimicrobial activity of zinc ascorbate against the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli was tested either alone or in combination {{with a variety of}} antimicrobial agents; their fractional inhibitory concentration index was determined using checkerboard tests. Methods: The SOD-like activity was measured in comparison with other ascorbic acid derivatives (ascorbic acid, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, and <b>sodium</b> <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>phosphate)</b> and zinc. The antimicrobial susceptibility of twelve strains each of S. aureus and E. coli isolated from patients with dermatological infections was tested, in comparison to a type strain of S. aureus and E. coli. Results: Zinc ascorbate had significant (P &lt; 0. 001) SOD-like activity compared with other ascorbic acid derivatives and zinc. Moreover, it showed antimicrobial activity against a type strain of S. aureus and E. coli, and its concentration (0. 064 % and 0. 128 % for S. aureus and E. coli, respectively) was sufficiently lower than the normal dose (5 %) of other ascorbic acid derivatives. Furthermore, combinations of zinc ascorbate with clindamycin, erythromycin, and imipenem against S. aureus (average fractional inhibitory concentration, 0. 59 &ndash; 0. 90), and with imipenem against E. coli (average fractional inhibitory concentration, 0. 64) isolated from patients with dermatological infections showed an additive effect.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. People and {{especially}} women are forever searching {{for new and}} improved ways to alter the appearance of their skin. Skin can be prematurely aged by various environmental factors, including prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light (Brannon, 2007). The aging of skin is amongst other factors facilitated by the degradation of collagen in the connective tissue (Uitto, 1993 : 299 – 314) (as quoted by Fisher et al., 1997 : 1420). Vitamin C and its derivatives {{are known to have}} anti–oxidant, as well as collagen forming properties (Gibbon et al., 2005 : 82). Vitamin C is a water–soluble compound and highly unstable. By using vitamin C–salts or esters such as <b>sodium</b> <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> the absorption of the API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) can be improved, when formulated in topical preparations. This is because of the esters being more stable and lipophilic than the original vitamin (Austria et al., 1997 : 795). Transdermal drug delivery has many advantages including bypassing hepatic metabolism and a reduction in side effects (Kydonieus et al., 2000 : 3). The main problem encountered with transdermal drug delivery is the barrier function of the skin, which assists the body in keeping foreign bodies, infections and UVR (ultraviolet radiation) out and it helps keeping water and other vital substances in the body (Rushmer et al., 1966 : 343). According to Shindo et al. (1994 : 123) there are significant amounts of natural vitamin C found in both the epidermis, as well as the dermis. The concentrations of vitamin C in the epidermis is however higher than in the dermis. Penetration of an API may be increased by making use of physical or chemical penetration enhancers. A relatively new carrier medium, used in this study, is Pheroid? technology. The principle of action for this method of enhancement rests on the use of vesicular structures with no phospholipids or cholesterol (Grobler et al., 2008 : 283). Ten different creams were formulated during this study. These formulations included various concentrations of the API, varying polarities; and either Pheroid? or non–Pheroid? formulas. Concentrations ranged between 1 and 3 % for the formulations. A 1 %, 2 % and 3 % cream was formulated in both Pheroid? and non–Pheroid? batches. Furthermore, a 2 % cream with more liquid paraffin in the formula, as well as a 2 % cream with less liquid paraffin in the formula were formulated (also in both Pheroid? and non–Pheroid? batches) {{in order to determine the}} effect iv of varying polarities of the formulations on the release and penetration of the API. Two placebo formulations were also prepared in order to determine the concentration of natural vitamin C found in the skin, which should be compensated for during diffusion studies. Furthermore, the aqueous solubility of the active ingredient was determined to be 6. 14 mg/ml and the octanol–water partition coefficient (log P) of the drug was found to be – 0. 005. This indicated that the drug would struggle to penetrate the skin, because of the fact that it is not soluble in both oil and water, but penetration could be improved by the fact that the drug is so highly water–soluble (Naik et al., 2000 : 321). Diffusion studies (where polytetrafluoroethylene membranes were used) were done in order to determine if the API was released from the formulation. The membrane release studies were performed over a 6 h period and it was observed that the 2 % non–Pheroid? cream, with less liquid paraffin in the formula, was the formulation with the highest average percentage released (2. 008 %) after the 6 h. Secondly was the 1 % Pheroid? formula. It had release of 1. 940 % after 6 h. It was thought that the higher polarity in the 2 % formulation would prevent the highly water soluble API from releasing from the formulation. The polarity of the cream was higher due to the increased amount of water in the formulation (Mitsui, 1997 : 343). Because of the high percentage of unionised species (99. 37 %) of the API, a certain degree of release was however expected (Barry, 2002 : 511). The vertical Franz cell diffusion studies, performed over 12 h, proved the 2 % non–Pheroid formulation to be the cream with the highest average concentration (3. 761 ?g/cm 2) diffused. The 1 % non–Pheroid? formulation (3. 555 ?g/cm 2) was the formulation closest to the 2 % non– Pheroid? formulation’s value. The high diffusion rates of the formulations can be attributed to the 99. 37 % unionised species of the API. According to Barry (2002 : 511) the unionised species of an API is usually lipid soluble and can pass readily across the stratum corneum. Furthermore, it seemed that the formulations which contained a lower concentration of the API performed greater than the formulations with higher concentrations of the active. This could be because of increased stability of the formulations, with lower concentrations of the API. The formulation with the highest average concentration of vitamin C in the stratum corneumepidermis (0. 457 ?g/ml) was the 2 % Pheroid? formulation with less liquid paraffin in the formula. This formulation showed a higher polarity because of the higher amount of water in the formulation (Mitsui, 1997 : 343). According to Bickers (2010 : 22) this could have led to the v largely unionised API’s penetration into the stratum corneum–epidermis, as this oil soluble species of the API have an affinity for the lipid rich membrane. The formulation with the highest average concentration of vitamin C in the epidermis–dermis was the 1 % Pheroid? formulation, with an average value of 0. 656 ?g/ml followed by the 2 % Pheroid? formula with a concentration of 0. 530 ?g/ml. This could be because of the API being entrapped in the Pheroid? and thus having an improved lipid solubility (Grobler et al., 2008 : 297). According to the experimental data the 1 % Pheroid? cream was the formulation which performed the best overall during the experiments. It was the formulation with the second highest average percentage (1. 940 %) API released, after a period of 6 h, after the membrane release studies and the 4 th highest concentration (3. 057 ?g/cm 2) of API, after skin diffusion over 12 h. This formulation was also found to be the cream which penetrated the epidermis–dermis (target site) the best to yield an average API concentration of 0. 656 ?g/ml, which could be ascribed to the Pheroid? in the formulation. Pheroid? encapsulated the API molecules and helped increase the penetration of the drug through the stratum corneum and into the dermis (Grobler et al. 2008 : 297). Master...|$|E

To overcome this problem, reasonable supplementations of antioxidants are widely practiced, mostly based on empirical protocols. An electrochemical process is proposed to choose the best molecules association inducing the greatest antioxidant capacity, by coupling homogeneous or heterogeneous catalytic reactions involving antioxidants with an electrochemical step. Cyclic voltammetry and constant potential electrolysis experiments were used to highlight regeneration reactions induced by specific associations of hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants in homogeneous medium or at liquid/liquid interface. Results showed that N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC) was effectively regenerated by both ascorbic acid (AA) and ascorbyl glucoside (AA- 2 G) but not by <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> magnesium (AA- 2 P).

The hydration effects were performed with the application of the formulations under study on the forearm of human volunteers and skin conditions were analyzed before and after a single application and daily applications during 4 weeks in terms of transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin moisture and viscoelastic properties. The raw material under study possessed free-radical scavenging activity and the formulation with it protected hairless mouse skin barrier function against UV damage. After 4 weeks of application on human skin, the formulation under study enhanced stratum corneum skin moisture and also showed hydration effects in deeper layers of the skin. Thus, it can be concluded that the cosmetic formulation containing a dispersion of liposome with MAP, ALA and kinetin under study showed photoprotective effects in skin barrier function as well as pronounced hydration effects on human skin, which suggests that this dispersion has potential antiaging effects.

40|$|Background/purpose: Vitamins C and its derivatives, mainly due {{to their}} {{antioxidant}} properties, are being used in cosmetic products to protect and to reduce the signs of ageing. However, there are no studies comparing the effects of vitamin C [ascorbic acid (AA) ] and its derivatives, magnesium <b>ascorbyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> (MAP) and <b>ascorbyl</b> tetra-isopalmitate (ATIP), when vehiculated in topical formulations, mainly using objective measurements, which are an important tool in clinical efficacy studies. Thus, {{the objective of this}} study was to determine the in vitro antioxidant activity of AA and its derivatives, MAP and ATIP, as well as their in vivo efficacy on human skin, when vehiculated in topical formulations. Methods: The study of antioxidant activity in vitro was performed with an aqueous and a lipid system. The in vivo methodology consisted of the application of these formulations on human volunteers` forearm skin and the analysis of the skin conditions after 4 -week period daily applications in terms of transepidermal water loss (TEWL), stratum corneum moisture content and viscoelasticity using a Tewameter (R), Corneometer (R) and Cutometer (R), respectively. Results: In vitro experiments demonstrated that in an aqueous system, AA had the best antioxidant potential, and MAP was more effective than ATIP, whereas in the lipid system ATIP was more effective than MAP. In in vivo studies, all formulations enhanced stratum corneum moisture content after a 4 -week period daily applications when compared with baseline values; however, only the formulation containing AA caused alterations in TEWL values. The formulations containing MAP caused alterations in the viscoelastic-to-elastic ratio, which suggested its action in the deeper layers of the skin. Conclusion: AA and its derivates presented an in vitro antioxidant activity but AA had the best antioxidant effect. In in vivo efficacy studies, only the formulation containing AA caused alterations in TEWL values and the formulation containing MAP caused alterations in the viscoelastic-to-elastic ratio. This way, vitamin C derivatives did not present the same effects of AA on human skin; however, MAP showed other significant effect-improving skin hydration, which is very important for the normal cutaneous metabolism and also to prevent skin alterations and early ageing...|$|R
40|$|Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) {{lowering}} is {{the mainstay}} of the current treatment guidelines {{in the management of}} cardiovascular risk. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are Currently the most effective LDL-C-lowering drugs. However, a substantial number of patients do not reach treatment targets with statins. Therefore, an unmet medical need exists for lipid-lowering drugs with novel mechanisms of action to reach the recommended cholesterol target levels, either by monotherapy or combination therapy. Upregulation of the LDL receptor with squalene synthase inhibitors has shown promising results in animal Studies but the clinical development of the lead compound lapaquistat (TAK- 475) has recently been discontinued. Ezetimibe combined with statins allowed significantly more patients to reach their LDL-C targets. Other inhibitors of intestinal cholesterol absorption such as disodium <b>ascorbyl</b> phytostanol <b>phosphate</b> (FM-VP 4) and bile acid transport inhibitors have shown positive results in early development trials, whereas the prospect of acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase inhibition in cardiovascular prevention is dire. Selective inhibition of messenger RNA (mRNA) by antisense oligonucleotides is a new approach to modify cholesterol levels. The inhibition of apolipoprotein B mRNA is in advanced development and mipomersen sodium (ISIS 301012) has shown striking results in phase II studies both as monotherapy as well as in combination with statin...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that animals fed a high fat (HF) diet supplemented with disodium <b>ascorbyl</b> phytostanyl <b>phosphate</b> (DAPP) exhibit reduced mass accumulation when compared to HF control. This compound is a water-soluble phytostanol ester and consists of a hydrophobic plant stanol covalently bonded to ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). To {{provide insight into the}} mechanism of this response, we examined the in vivo effects of a high fat diet supplemented with ascorbic acid (AA) in the presence and absence of unesterified phytosterols (PS), and set out to establish whether the supplements have a synergistic effect in a diet-induced obesity mouse model. Our data indicate that HF diet supplementation with a combination of 1 % w/w phytosterol and 1 % w/w ascorbic acid results in reduced mass accumulation, with mean differences in absolute mass between PSAA and HF control of 10. 05 %; and differences in mass accumulation of 21. 6 % (i. e. the PSAA group gained on average 21 % less mass each week from weeks 7 - 12 than the HF control group). In our previous study, the absolute mass difference between the 2 % DAPP and HF control was 41 %, while the mean difference in mass accumulation between the two groups for weeks 7 - 12 was 67. 9 %. Mass loss was not observed in animals supplemented with PS or AA alone. These data suggest that the supplements are synergistic with respect to mass accumulation, and the esterification of the compounds further potentiates the response. Our data also indicate that chronic administration of PS, both in the presence and absence of AA, results in changes to fecal output and food transit time, providing insight into the possibility of long-term changes in intestinal function related to PS supplementation...|$|R
