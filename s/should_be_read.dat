5|$|With the reconfirmation of the Charters in 1300, an {{additional}} document was granted, the Articuli super Cartas (The Articles upon the Charters). It {{was composed of}} 17 articles and sought in part {{to deal with the}} problem of enforcing the Charters. Magna Carta and the Forest Charter were to be issued to the sheriff of each county, and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> four times a year at the meetings of the county courts. Each county should have a committee of three men who could hear complaints about violations of the Charters.|$|E

25|$|Compounds <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> as if {{each word}} were spelled separately, {{and they may}} {{therefore}} appear to violate the normal rules. That may sometimes cause confusion if the word is not {{known to be a}} compound.|$|E
25|$|When {{computer}} programs display messages that alert the user, an exclamation mark may be shown alongside it {{to indicate that}} the message is important and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>read.</b> This often happens when an error is made, or to obtain user consent for hazardous operations such as deleting data.|$|E

It was very much who he was." ...|$|R

She gets Anastasia in trouble for reading and talking to Polly about [...] "A History of the Pirate Queen" [...] during class.

25|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the first word is the Turkic title buyla or boyla (also spelled boila) which is attested on several Old Turkic and Danube Bulgar inscriptions and also mentioned by some 9th and 10th centuries Byzantine authors. Some scholars proposed that Buyla <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> as a personal name in this text.|$|E
25|$|Evans, at one point, {{published}} an {{assertion that the}} disc had been written, and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>read,</b> from the center out; {{because it would have}} been easiest to place the inscription first and then size the disc to fit the text. There is general agreement that he was wrong, and Evans himself later changed his mind: the inscription was made, and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>read,</b> from the outside in toward the centre. The centres of the spirals are not in the centre of the disc, and some of the symbols near the centre are crowded, as though the maker was cramped for space. One pair of symbols are set top-to-bottom, so it is hard to tell what order they should be in. Except in the cramped section, when there are overstrikes, the inner symbol overlies the outer symbol. Jean Faucounau has proposed a reconstruction of the scribe's movements, which would also require an inward direction; Yves Duhoux says that any outward reading may be discarded. Despite this consensus, there are still a few such attempted decipherments (See Phaistos Disc decipherment claims).|$|E
25|$|Fans of {{the series}} often have strong {{opinions}} over {{the order in which}} the books <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>read.</b> The issue revolves around the placement of The Magician's Nephew and The Horse and His Boy in the series. Both are set significantly earlier in the story of Narnia than their publication order and fall somewhat outside the main story arc connecting the others. The reading order of the other five books is not disputed.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in the 1990s, {{after the}} fall of the USSR, a fresh reading of Hegel took place in the West. For these scholars, fairly well {{represented}} by the Hegel Society of America and in cooperation with German scholars such as Otto Pöggeler and Walter Jaeschke, Hegel's works <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> without preconceptions. Marx plays little-to-no role in these new readings. Some American philosophers associated with this movement include Lawrence Stepelevich, Rudolf Siebert, Richard Dien Winfield, and Theodore Geraets.|$|E
25|$|Finally, he {{suggested}} that {{the meaning of the}} Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> the same way that Article IV's Privileges and Immunities Clause was interpreted. He cited Justice Bushrod Washington's interpretation of the latter clause in the famous case of Corfield v. Coryell and stated that this is what the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment had intended. Thomas made a case for the revival of the clause to protect fundamental rights of citizens.|$|E
25|$|Patents {{have been}} criticized in the {{developing}} world, as they are thought to reduce access to existing medicines. Reconciling patents and universal access to medicine would require an efficient international policy of price discrimination. Moreover, under the TRIPS agreement of the World Trade Organization, countries must allow pharmaceutical products to be patented. In 2001, the WTO adopted the Doha Declaration, which indicates that the TRIPS agreement <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> {{with the goals of}} public health in mind, and allows some methods for circumventing pharmaceutical monopolies: via compulsory licensing or parallel imports, even before patent expiration.|$|E

25|$|Hallel is recited {{during the}} evening prayers on the first (and, outside Israel, second) night of Pesach, except by Lithuanian and German Jews, and by all {{communities}} during the Pesach Seder service. According to the Talmud, there was a dispute between the school of Hillel and the school of Shammai regarding the reading of Hallel on Pesach. According to the school of Shammai, only the first psalm (Ps. 113) <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> before the meal, whereas the school of Hillel advocated reading the first two psalms (Ps. 113 and 114). The remaining Psalms would be said after the Grace After Meals (as always, the halacha follows the school of Hillel).|$|E
25|$|Of these, {{the novels}} (The Legend of the Condor Heroes, The Return of the Condor Heroes, and The Heavenly Sword and the Dragon Saber) {{make up the}} Condor Trilogy and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> in that order; {{a number of his}} other works are also linked to this trilogy (Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils is a {{precursor}} to the Condor Trilogy). Fox Volant of the Snowy Mountain and The Young Flying Fox are companion works with the same protagonist and characters from The Book and the Sword appear. A few major characters from Sword Stained with Royal Blood also appear in his final novel The Deer and the Cauldron as minor characters.|$|E
25|$|Measuring {{the spin}} of these {{entangled}} particles along anti-parallel directions—i.e., {{along the same}} axis but in opposite directions, the set of all results is perfectly correlated. On the other hand, if measurements are performed along parallel directions they always yield opposite results, and the set of measurements shows perfect anti-correlation. This is {{in accord with the}} above stated probabilities of measuring the same result in these two cases. Finally, measurement at perpendicular directions has a 50% chance of matching, and the total set of measurements is uncorrelated. These basic cases are illustrated in the table below. Columns <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> as examples of pairs of values that could be recorded by Alice and Bob with time increasing going to the right.|$|E

The purpose of this list is to provide suggestions for literature with a wide appeal to elementary school students...|$|R
25|$|Accordingly, the Book of Revelation <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> <b>read</b> as {{an enigmatic}} warning, {{but as an}} {{encouraging}} vision of Christ's definitive victory over evil.|$|R
25|$|In {{fact there}} is the other {{possibility}}, that + <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> as disjunction, This other possibility extends from the disjoint union case, where exclusive or and non-exclusive or both give the same answer. Handling this ambiguity was an early problem of the theory, reflecting the modern use of both Boolean rings and Boolean algebras (which are simply different aspects of one type of structure). Boole and Jevons struggled over just this issue in 1863, {{in the form of}} the correct evaluation of x + x. Jevons argued for the result x, which is correct for + as disjunction. Boole kept the result as something undefined. He argued against the result 0, which is correct for exclusive or, because he saw the equation x + x = 0 as implying x = 0, a false analogy with ordinary algebra.|$|E
25|$|Lao uses three ligatures, all {{comprising}} the letter ຫ (h). As a tonal language, most consonant sounds in Lao {{are represented by}} two consonants, which will govern {{the tone of the}} syllable. Five consonant sounds are only represented by a single consonant letter (ງ (ŋ), ນ (m), ມ (n), ລ (l), ວ (w)), meaning that one cannot render all the tones for words beginning with these sounds. A silent ຫ indicates that the syllable <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> with the tone rules for ຫ, rather than those of the following consonant. Three consonants can form ligatures with the letter ຫ. ຫ+ນ=ໜ (n), ຫ+ມ=ໝ (m) and ຫ+ລ=ຫຼ (l). ງ (ŋ) and ວ (w) just form clusters: ຫງ (ŋ) and ຫວ (w). ລ (l) can also be used written in a cluster rather than as a ligature: ຫລ (l).|$|E
25|$|The cycle's second painting, The Birth of the Princess, {{represents}} Medici's April 26, 1573 birth. Symbols and allegory appear {{throughout the}} painting. On the left, two putti {{play with a}} shield on which the Medici crest appears, suggesting that Heaven favored the young Medici {{from the moment of}} her birth. The river god in the picture's right corner is likely an allusion to the Arno River that passes through Florence, Marie's city of birth. The cornucopia above the infant's head can be interpreted as a harbinger of Marie's future glory and fortune; the lion may be seen as symbolic of power and strength. The glowing halo around the infant's head should not be seen as a reference to Christian imagery; rather, it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>read</b> according to imperial iconography which uses the halo as an indication of the Queen's divine nature and of her future reign. Though Marie was born under the Taurus sign, Sagittarius appears in the painting; it may be seen as a guardian of imperial power.|$|E
