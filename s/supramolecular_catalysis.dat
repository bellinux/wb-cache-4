40|$|In recent years, {{monodentate}} phosphorus ligands (e. g. phosphites, phosphonites, phosphoramidites and phosphinamines) {{have held}} {{the stage in}} asymmetric catalysis. 1 In addition to their outstanding activity and selectivity, comparable or even superior to those of bidentate ligands, the convenient, fast and practical preparation from commercially available materials underlines their potential for industrial applications. Furthermore, the modular nature of all these ligands allows the synthesis {{of a variety of}} representatives, thereby making a combinatorial approach possible. My PhD research project deals with the synthesis of libraries of new chiral monodentate P-ligands and their screening in asymmetric transition metal-catalyzed reactions through two innovative approaches: combination of binaphthol-derived phosphites and C 1 -symmetric phosphinamines for the selective generation of heteroleptic catalysts in Rh- and Pd-mediated reactions (Ligand Combination Approach, Research line 1); supramolecular ligand-ligand interactions for highly selective transition metal <b>catalysis</b> (<b>Supramolecular</b> Approach, Research line 2). Research line 1 In 2002 - 3, the groups of Reetz and Feringa independently used a binary mixture of chiral monodentate Pligands in several asymmetric rhodium-catalyzed reactions. By mixing two different ligands (La and Lb) {{in the presence of a}} transition metal [M], three species can be formed: [M]LaLa, [M]LbLb (homocomplexes) and [M]LaLb (heterocomplex). The heterocomplex is often more reactive and more (regio-, diastereo-, enantio-) selective than either of the two homocomplexes. Moreover, under thermodynamic control the heterocomplex : homocomplexes ratios usually exceed the statistical value (2 : 1 : 1). The ideal case would constitute an equilibrium completely in favor of the heterocomplex [M]LaLb, because a single well-defined catalyst would then exist in the reaction mixture and the undesired competition of the less selective homocomplexes would be avoided. We were intrigued by the remarkable selectivities reported for the mixtures of chiral ligands (binolderived phosphites, phosphonites and phosphoramidites) with achiral phosphines. 4 In particular, the 1 : 1 mixture of a chiral phosphite with an achiral phosphine was reported to induce reversal of the enantioselectivity in the Rh-catalysed hydrogenation of N-acetamido acrylate (compared to the chiral phosphite alone). The only possible explanation for this peculiar behaviour is the selective formation of the phosphite-phosphine Rh-heterocomplex, favoured by electronically matching one -donor ligand (phosphine) and one -acceptor ligand (phosphite). As enantiomerically pure chiral phosphines are not easy to synthesize, we were wondering whether the phosphine ligands could be substituted by other - donor phosphorus ligands still retaining the thermodynamic preference for the formation of the heterocomplex. For this reason, we turned our attention to chiral phosphinamines, which are easy to prepare enantiomerically pure, and have electronic properties similar to those of phosphines. 5 DFT calculations showed that the phosphite-phosphinamine rhodium heterocomplex is more stable than the two homocomplexes by 11. 29 kcal/mol We synthesized a library of monodentate chiral phosphites 1 a-d by reacting enantiopure BINOL-PCl with different chiral and achiral alcohols. Monodentate chiral phosphinamines 2 a-e were prepared by reaction of Ph 2 PCl with a number of C 2 -symmetric secondary amines and C 1 -symmetric secondary and primary amines. Complexation studies were performed by means of 31 P-NMR, using Rh(acac) (C 2 H 4) 2 as the rhodium source. When C 1 -symmetric phosphinamine ligands were employed, the cis-heterocomplexes were formed with selectivity ranging from moderate (70 %) to excellent (_ 99 %). The homo- and heterocombinations of phosphites and C 1 -symmetric phosphinamines were then screened in the rhodium-catalyzed hydrogenation of methyl 2 -acetamidoacrylate. Remarkably, the 1 : 1 combination of a BINOL-derived phosphite and a phosphinamine induced reversal of the enantioselectivity, compared both to the phosphite and the phosphinamine alone. This heterocombination induced a peculiar stereochemical outcome also in the palladium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution of rac- 1, 3 - The heterocomplexes formed in this way are expected to have reduced degrees of freedom 7 compared to the complexes of normal monodentate ligands, and thus supramolecular ligands somehow resemble traditional bidentate ligands. According to this analogy, they are often referred to as supramolecular bidentate ligands or self-assembled ligands, thanks to their ability to spontaneously form bidentate systems in solution. These terms also apply to those supramolecular ligands that are only capable of noncomplementary interactions: indeed these systems are still capable of forming rigid and conformationally restricted complexes, although they cannot selectively form heterocomplexes when used in a mixture, which quite reduces their "combinatorial appeal". Prompted by the studies of Prof. Reek and co-workers on the synthesis of supramolecular bidentate heterocomplexes through complementary interactions (e. g. coordinative bondings) 8 and by the efficient resolution strategy of racemic N-benzyl _-amino acids (N-Bn-AA) by liquid-liquid extraction using a chiral salen–cobalt(III) complex as enantioselective receptor, accomplished in our laboratories, we decided to use the salen-cobalt(III) -N-benzyl-L-serine complex as a chiral platform for the preparation of new families of supramolecular mono- and bi-dentate P-ligands (Scheme 4 A and B). The salen-cobalt(III) -N-Bn-AA complexes, in fact, possess a rigid framework with the salen ligand in a cis-_-folded arrangement around the octahedral cobalt ion. The remaining two cis coordination sites are occupied by the N-benzyl _-amino acid, which is thus accommodated in the “binding pocket” of the chiral cobalt complex. 9 b Ligands 3 were synthesized in good yields starting from the symmetrical tetra-t-butyl-salen which was transformed into the corresponding cobalt(III) acetate complex, and the acetate ion was exchanged with Nbenzyl- L-serine. In the case of symmetric salen backbone, the complex was obtained pure in high yield and the phosphite moieties were then introduced by reaction with different diol-derived chlorophosphite. In the case of the supramolecular bidentate ligands 4, the unsymmetrical hydroxymethyl-containing salen afforded the corresponding cobalt(III) acetate complex as a mixture of two inseparable diastereoisomers. Complexation of monodentate ligands 3 to rhodium(I) was studied by 31 P-NMR spectroscopy, which showed the formation of the desired Rh-complexes. The reactivity of supramolecular monodentate Pligands was investigated in two Pd-catalyzed-allylic alkylation on (E) - 1, 3 -diphenylallyl acetate and Pdcatalized desymmetrization of meso-cyclopenten- 2 -ene- 1, 4 -diol biscarbamate. We are now exploring new synthetic pathways to obtain the unsymmetrical (S,S) -salen-ligand and the corresponding unsymmetrical (S,S) -salen-cobalt(III) -N-Bn-L-serine bidentate P-ligand in a pure diastereoisomeric fashion. We have also investigated the design and synthesis of a novel class of chiral monodentate phosphite ligands, named PhthalaPhos, which contain a phthalic acid primary diamide moiety. Such phthalamidic group displays both donor and acceptor hydrogen bonding properties that, in principle, can give rise to supramolecular interactions both between the ligands and with the reaction substrate The pre-catalytic Rh complex of one of these ligands was fully characterized and studied by NMR, IR and mass spectroscopy, which confirmed the presence of hydrogen bonds between the coordinated ligands, and the formation of a supramolecular bidentate ligand. The catalytic properties of these new ligands were assessed in the rhodium-catalyzed hydrogenation of benchmark olefins (e. g. methyl 2 -acetoamidoacrylate and N-(1 -phenylvinyl) acetamide), taking the known phosphite 9 as a touchstone. Four ligands gave e. e. values higher than 97 % with methyl 2 -acetoamidoacrylate as substrate, and six reached the same level of performance with N-(1 -phenylvinyl) acetamide. Remarkably, the reference ligand 9, featuring the same BINOL phosphite moiety, gave only 84 % and 90 % e. e. respectively for the same substrates, thus suggesting that the phthalimide residue significantly influences the catalytic properties of these ligands. Evaluation of the catalytic properties of the Phthalaphos ligands were also extended to the Rh-catalyzed hydrogenation of more challenging substrates of potential industrial interest, such as N-(3, 4 -dihydronaphthalen- 1 -yl) acetamide and (E) -methyl 2 -(acetamidomethyl) - 3 -phenylacrylate. The results of this screening were quite variegated both in terms of activity and enantioselectivity, but the employment of a Phthalaphos ligand gave the highest e. e. value ever obtained on N-(3, 4 -dihydronaphthalen- 1 -yl) acetamide with phosphite ligands and the highest e. e. value ever obtained with (E) -methyl 2 -(acetamidomethyl) - 3 -phenylacrylate...|$|R

40|$|Water {{is unique}} among liquids {{for its ability}} for {{tetrahedral}} coordination with four neighbouring molecules. Water catalyzed reactions (or spontaneous reactions) are pH independent hydrolytic processes that involve the transfer of one or several protons to or from water molecules in the transition state (TS) of the rate determining step. Indeed, in these reactions one water molecule acts as a nucleophile while one or several act as general bases, and typically show a) high negative values of entropy of activation (∆S ≠), and b) high kinetic solvent isotope effect (KSIE). In these reactions water is solvent, nucleophile and catalyst. The hydrolyses of alkyl halides, alkyl and aryl sulphonates, and derivatives of carboxylic acids (esters, amides) have been extensively studied. The reaction with derivatives of saturated carbons is quite different than the hydrolyses of esters and amides. At least two water molecules must be strongly bound at the TS to produce a high KSIE, restricting the number of possible positions of these molecules. The number of molecules involved in the proton transfer (two molecules per proton) can be determined by proton inventory. Polymolecular mechanisms have been found for these reactions with 3 - 5 molecules involved in the TS. Hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the substrate is determinant of the mechanism. <b>Supramolecular</b> <b>Catalysis</b> Induced by Polysaccharide...|$|E

Different strategies for the design and preparation of chiral supramolecular structures are described along with their applications to enantioselective binding and catalysis. The intrinsically chiral M 4 L 6 12 - supramolecular assembly developed by the Raymond group is introduced, and its catalytic scope is reviewed. Chapter 2. The development of an asymmetric variant of the aza-Cope transformation is presented. Application of the resolved Ga 4 L 6 12 - assembly to this catalytic transformation gives modest but significant enantioselectivity (up to 64 % ee) with a varied scope of allyl enammonium cations. This represents the first reported example of asymmetric <b>supramolecular</b> <b>catalysis</b> with substantial enantioselectivity and catalytic turnover. Use of a relatively unreactive substrate allowed characterization of a host-substrate complex by X-ray diffraction, giving insight into the means of enantiodifferentiation by the chiral host. Additionally, {{the structure of the}} M 4 L 6 12 - assembly was modified by substituting other trivalent cations (Fe 3 +, 3 +) into the M 4 L 6 12 - host, modulating the enantioselectivity of the rearrangement. Efforts to emulate allosteric regulation using externally associated chiral cations are also described. Chapter 3. The engineering of a high-turnover supramolecular catalyst containing a cationic ruthenium complex is described. The RuCp(PMe 3) (MeCN) 2 + cation, an allyl alcohol isomerization catalyst, was incorporated into the Ga 4 L 6 12 - assembly. While encapsulated, the organometallic complex experiences only mild rate attenuations, while maintaining its remarkably high activity. This hybrid catalyst is capable of more than 1000 turnovers, eclipsing other known supramolecular catalysts. The kinetics of catalysis are also analyzed, revealing inhibition both by acetonitrile and the allyl alcohol substrates. The protection offered by encapsulation in the assembly also allowed the preparation of the larger RuCp*(PMe 3) (MeCN) 2 + complex, which is both stable and catalytically active. Preliminary investigations of this complex are described. Chapter 4. Cationic gold(I) catalysts encapsulated inside assembly 1 4 L 6 assembly, R 3 PAuX (X = Cl, Br) complexes have been found to lose their halide ligand and reside in the nanovessel's cavity as the free cation. This host-guest complex is catalytically active in both the hydroalkoxylation and hydroamination of allenes, generating cyclic, chiral ethers and amines. The rate of catalysis for the bound gold cation is observed to be higher than that for the bulk-solution gold species by about an order of magnitude. Efforts to incorporate this gold catalyst into the resolved Ga 4 L 6 12 - assembly are detailed, though this family of organometallic catalysts has thus far been incompatible with the resolved Ga 4 L 6 12 - assembly...|$|E
40|$|The {{lessons learned}} from p-octiphenyl β-barrel pores are applied to the {{rational}} design of synthetic multifunctional pore 1 that is unstable but inert, two characteristics proposed to be ideal for practical applications. Nonlinear dependence on monomer concentration provided direct evidence that pore 1 is tetrameric (n = 4. 0), unstable, and "invisible," i. e., incompatible with structural studies by conventional methods. The long lifetime of high-conductance single pores in planar bilayers demonstrated that rigid-rod β-barrel 1 is inert and large (d ≈ 12 Å). Multifunctionality of rigid-rod β-barrel 1 was confirmed by adaptable blockage of pore host 1 with representative guests in planar (8 -hydroxy- 1, 3, 6 -pyrenetrisulfonate, KD = 190 μM, n = 4. 9) and spherical bilayers (poly-l-glutamate, KD ≤ 105 nM, n = 1. 0; adenosine triphosphate, KD = 240 μM, n = 2. 0) and saturation kinetics for the esterolysis of a representative substrate (8 -acetoxy- 1, 3, 6 -pyrenetrisulfonate, KM = 0. 6 μM). The thermodynamic instability of rigid-rod β-barrel 1 provided unprecedented access to experimental evidence for <b>supramolecular</b> <b>catalysis</b> (n = 3. 7). Comparison of the obtained kcat = 0. 03 min- 1 with the kcat ≈ 0. 18 min- 1 for stable analogues gave a global KD ≈ 39 μM 3 for supramolecular catalyst 1 with a monomer/barrel ratio ≈ 20 under experimental conditions. The demonstrated "invisibility" of supramolecular multifunctionality identified molecular modeling as an attractive method to secure otherwise elusive insights into structure. The first molecular mechanics modeling (MacroModel, MMFF 94) of multifunctional rigid-rod β-barrel pore hosts 1 with internal 1, 3, 6 -pyrenetrisulfonate guests is reported...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{theme of}} my {{graduate}} {{research is to}} understand forces involved in supramolecular, hydrophobically-driven interactions, primarily in cyclodextrin systems and to use those interactions in applications ranging from fluorescence-based sensing to <b>supramolecular</b> <b>catalysis.</b> This research has included a highly interdisciplinary research project exploring the effects of cation-π interactions on surfactant/lipid bilayer vesicles for delivery applications. Cyclodextrins, which are commercially available, torus-shaped cyclic oligoamyloses, have been selected as the supramolecular hosts in these studies because of their well-defined hydrophobic interior cavity. The hydrophilic exterior, in turn imparts substantial aqueous solubility. Moreover, the primary and secondary hydroxyl groups of the cyclodextrin provide a myriad of synthetic handles for further modification and chemical derivatization. Cyclodextrin-based catalytic systems have been envisioned for mild, environmentally friendly transformations in high-impact organic reactions. The basis of this research stems from the ability of cyclodextrins to form hydrophobic complexes with small molecules, thereby lowering the entropic barrier {{for the formation of}} a transition state in selected organic reactions. Moreover, the hydrophobic complexes of cyclodextrin with small molecules have also been shown to be more reactive from the perspective of many organic transformations. The first manuscript “Cyclodextrin-promoted Diels Alder reactions of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon under mild reaction conditions” describes Diels Alder reactions of a model polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), 9 -anthracenemethanol with N-substituted maleimides under mild reaction conditions (aqueous solvent, 40 °C) in the presence of commercially available cyclodextrins. In this system, hydrophobic complexation of the N-substituent in turn modifies the electronics of the alkene double bond, resulting in its enhanced reactivity. We found that cyclodextrin complexation of the N-substituent on the maleimide (driven by hydrophobic interactions) was the key factor in determining the rate of the reaction and the overall conversion to product. Optimal results were found using N-cyclohexylmaleimide with a methyl-β-cyclodextrin host, with 94...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of molecular recognition and {{transition metal catalysis}} could lead to an interesting form of <b>supramolecular</b> <b>catalysis.</b> Thus, {{it would be interesting}} to synthesize phosphine ftmctionalised cyclodextrins and to investigate their uses in catalysis. We have developed several routes to phosphine functionalised CD ligands and their metal complexes. By using 6 -O-tosyl-β-cyclodextrin, two phosphine ligands CDP and CDNP were synthesized. Two polydentate ligands CDNNP and CD 3 NP were also prepared starting from 6 -(2 -aminoethyl) -amino- 6 -deoxy-β-cylcodextrin. In order to mimic metalloenzymes, several transition metal complexes were prepared as well, including [PtCl(CDNNP) ]+, [PdCl(CDNNP) ]+, and [Pd(CDNNP) (η 1 -allyl) ]+Cl-. In the other part of this thesis, we investigated the reactions of terminal acetylenes with M(PCP). The vinylidene complex OsCl(=C=CHR) (PPh 3) (PCP) has been isolated from the reactions of OsCl(PPh 3) (PCP) with terminal acetylenes. However, the vinylidene complexes do not undergo coupling reactions, but react with water to form carbyne complexes. In the case of rhodium, reaction of 1, 3 - (PPh 2 CH 2) 2 C 6 H 4 (PCHP) with [RhCl(COD) ] 2 in isopropanol produced a mixture of bimetallic complexes [RhCl(COD) ] 2 (μ 2 -PCHP), RhH(PCP) (μ-Cl) 2 Rh(COD) and [RhHCl(PCP) ] 2 (μ 2 -PCHP). Reaction of RhH(PCP) (μ-Cl) 2 Rh(COD) with CCl 4 or CHCl 3 produced RhCl(PCP) (μ-Cl) 2 Rh(COD). Except RhHCl(PCP) ] 2 (μ 2 -PCHP), all the bimetallic complexes are catalytically active for polymerization of phenylacetylene. It is interesting to note that very different products were obtained from the reactions of terminal acetylenes with M(PCP) complexes. Ruthenium complexes would produce coupling products, osmium complexes would produce vinylidene complexes, while rhodium complexes would lead to the polymerization of acetylenes...|$|E
40|$|Supramolecular {{chemistry}} {{allows the}} rapid formation of complex systems through self-assembly. These systems often possess unique properties not observed for conventional covalent constructs and have potential applications {{in areas such}} as sensing, drug delivery and catalysis. Metallosupramolecular container compounds have been shown to catalyse reactions with both regio- and stereo-selectivity in methods analogous to enzyme type catalysis. Separately, visible-light photoredox catalysis has recently gained considerable interest as an efficient, green and mild method for the rapid synthesis of many chemical compounds. In order to combine the favourable properties of both <b>supramolecular</b> <b>catalysis</b> and visible-light photoredox catalysis, a number of photoredox active metallosupramolecular assemblies were designed, synthesised and analysed. Initial steps were taken to stabilise a known iridium-based M 6 L 4 luminescent cage compound to allow guest encapsulation to take place. The incorporation of isocyanide donors as strong ligands improved the stability of model compounds but synthesis of an analogous three-dimensional assembly was unsuccessful. Instead, a “complex-as-ligand” approach was taken that allowed the straight-forward formation of Pd 2 L 4 systems from a range of photoactive iridium complexes. Importantly, unlike many other photoactive systems, the complexation to palladium did not drastically affect the photoredox properties of the constituent iridium complexes. Multiple approaches were then taken to improve both the stability and guest binding properties of the photoactive assembly in an effort to achieve supramolecular photoredox catalysis. Utilising a model system, a general method was thus developed for enhancing the association constants of neutral guests in organic solvents by switching to large, non-coordinating counter ions that provided reduced competition for the internal binding site. In combination with this increased binding affinity, a range of guest properties were adjusted by association with the hydrogen bond donor environment of the internal cavity. The encapsulation of quinone based oxidants led to unexpected and novel reaction pathways not observed in the bulk phase. As such, this work represents a significant advancement in development of metallosupramolecular systems capable of regio- and stereo-selective photoredox catalysis...|$|E
40|$|Nature {{has been}} a source of {{inspiration}} for scientists as billion years of evolution have resulted in magnificent examples of how processes can be controlled efficiently. In the field of <b>supramolecular</b> <b>catalysis,</b> enzymes have been the major source of inspiration. As such, many synthetic systems have been prepared to mimic certain aspects of enzymes, with a strong focus on connecting catalytically active sites to cavities or binding sites having affinity for the substrate. [1, 2] Although such approaches have resulted in interesting new tools to control selectivity,[3 – 5] we are not nearly close to the abilities of Nature to control chemical transformations. One of the major differences between Nature and synthetic approaches is that in biological systems, chemical processes take place in a complex out-of-equilibrium environment. [6] In a cell, many chemical transformations occur simultaneously or in controlled sequence, involving an impressive number of different components. An important challenge for biologists is to understand how this organized complexity leads to emerging properties. As a result, new fields such as systems biology[7] including non-equilibrium thermodynamics[8] have been developed. Synthetic chemists traditionally aim for systems that are as clean and pure as possible,[9] and it is only recently that complexity in chemical systems received attention. [10 – 12] Despite the interesting perspectives, complexity in homogeneous catalysis has not been a research focus in itself, although many aspects related to complexity have been reported. Product inhibition and catalyst poisoning are relevant to complex chemistry as they imply processes with feedback loops. Dynamic catalyst libraries and combinatorial catalysis require selection procedures,[6, 13] and nonlinear effect (NLE) in asymmetric catalysis[14 – 16] can lead to emerging properties. With this in mind we decided to study in detail NLE using dinuclear hydrogenation catalysts C that have four chiral ligands. Application of nonenantiopure ligands can lead to formation of heterochiral complexes (with more than two chiral ligands) with different properties and these complexes can theoretically be more active and selective than their homochiral analogues. [16] Catalytically active complexes with four chiral ligands are rare, and for hydrogenation complex C is, to the best of our knowledge, the only example. The use of a racemic ligand could lead to the formation of ten stereoisomers of C (Figure 1) ...|$|E
