40|$|This Article {{discusses}} {{the role of}} <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> in the judicial culture of New York. In order to place <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> in a context, Part II outlines the emergence and decline of <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> in the federal system. Part III then traces the origin of <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> in New York to Cardozo 2 ̆ 7 s dictum in Lemon. Part IV explains how <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> is {{an aspect of the}} much broader inherent judicial power, which finds expression in the familiar common law decision-making process. Part V discusses three principal areas in which <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> has been exercised by New York courts since Cardozo: formulating rules of discovery, regulating grand jury practice, and fashioning remedies for governmental misconduct. Finally, Part VI demonstrates that <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> is a legitimate exercise of judicial authority based on two distinct theories: as a sub-constitutional common law of justice and fair dealing, and {{as an integral part of}} the court 2 ̆ 7 s inherent common law power to formulate rules for the proper administration of justice...|$|R

He {{found that the}} instant case fell {{within the scope of}} the <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> as delineated by Powell's opinion, since it was evidence seized from the defendants themselves. The government had argued, however, that none of them had suffered a violation of their privacy expectations and therefore the <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> could not be invoked. But Payner [...] "did not hold that defendants must establish a legitimate expectation of privacy to invoke the <b>supervisory</b> <b>powers</b> if it is proven that the challenged evidence was seized from defendants", Bauer wrote, and had explicitly rejected a notion that it was identical with the Fourth Amendment. [...] "We recognize that the <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> is a complement to, not a substitute for, the Fourth Amendment." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article, and of its earlier {{companion}} article (Part (1) Rule-making, 12 European Business Organization Law Review (2011) p. 41), {{is to examine the}} implications of the new European Securities and Markets Authority which was established in January 2011. In the wake of the financial crisis, the case for institutional reform and for conferring regulatory and <b>supervisory</b> <b>powers</b> on a central EU authority became compelling. But any institutional design would have struggled given the necessity for compromise. The central difficulty is one of nuance. Where on the spectrum from national powers to EU powers, and with respect to regulation and supervision, should any new body's powers be placed if optimum outcomes are to be achieved? The question is further complicated by the different dynamics and risks of centralising rule-making and of centralising supervision, even if there is considerable symbiosis between these activities. This article considers ESMA's <b>supervisory</b> <b>powers.</b> It argues that, by contrast with its rule-making powers, the current and potential extent of ESMA's <b>supervisory</b> <b>powers</b> has pushed ESMA too high up the spectrum towards EU intervention. Local supervision of the EU rule-book represents an important safety valve for the EU financial market but this safety valve may be obstructed by ESMA's undue standardisation of supervisory practices. ESMA's extensive direct <b>supervisory</b> <b>powers</b> are also troubling given concerns as to their effectiveness. It was {{always going to be a}} challenge to draw the dividing line between ESMA's <b>supervisory</b> <b>powers</b> and those of national competent authorities. But the line may have been drawn too far on the side of operational centralisation...|$|R

[...] "Because the <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> is non-constitutional in nature," [...] he wrote, [...] "federal courts may utilize it to create standards that exceed minimum constitutional levels. Hence, the power need not be doctrinally confined to the vindication of personal rights ... The supervisorypower enables federal courts, in proper circumstances, to shift the focus from the rights of particular litigants and place it upon governmental conduct or institutions threatening the courts' integrity." ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of {{different}} types of bank <b>supervisory</b> <b>powers</b> in place before the crisis on bank risk-taking during the crisis. We employ data of more than 8000 banks from high-income OECD countries for the 2007 - 2011 period and impaired loans to gross loans ratio as proxy for bank risk-taking. Our Hausman-Taylor estimates indicate that the powers of bank supervisors to shake up the organizational structure of banks are more effective than powers to issue monetary penalties. Our results also suggest that <b>supervisory</b> <b>powers</b> do not affect risk-taking behavior of systemically important banks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we empirically {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} financial and auditing requirements, capital requirements, official <b>supervisory</b> <b>power,</b> {{and the likelihood of}} receiving a qualified audit opinion. The sample consists of 71 qualified financial statements and 17, 526 unqualified ones, from 3, 642 banking institutions operating in 15 old and new EU countries over the period 1999 - 2006. The results indicate that financial and auditing requirements have a negative influence, while <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> has a positive impact, on the likelihood of qualified audit opinions. Concerning capital requirements, we find that only initial stringency has an impact on audit opinions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R

40|$|Relying on {{something}} it calls <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> or <b>supervisory</b> authority, the Supreme Court regularly prescribes {{rules of procedure}} and evidence for inferior courts. Both scholars and the Court have treated the Court 2 ̆ 7 s exercises of this authority as unexceptional exercises of the inherent authority that Article III grants every federal court to regulate procedure {{in the course of}} adjudication. Article III 2 ̆ 7 s grant of inherent authority, however, is conventionally understood as permitting a federal court to regulate its own proceedings. When the Supreme Court exercises <b>supervisory</b> <b>power,</b> it regulates the proceedings of other federal courts. More than a reference to every court 2 ̆ 7 s inherent authority, therefore, is required to justify the Court 2 ̆ 7 s action. If the Supreme Court possesses a unique ability to regulate federal court procedure, it must be because of some unique attribute of the Supreme Court. This Article explores a justification that may well animate the Court 2 ̆ 7 s assertions of supervisory power: the notion that the Court possesses <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> by virtue of its constitutional supremacy. Analyzing this justification requires pursuit of two questions that are wholly unexplored in the literature and case law. Does Article III 2 ̆ 7 s distinction between supreme and inferior courts operate only as a limit on the way that Congress can structure the judicial department, or does it also operate as a source of inherent authority for the Supreme Court? And assuming that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s supremacy grants it inherent authority over inferior courts, is <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> over procedure part of the authority granted...|$|R

Several years later, when the Court created the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule in United States v. Leon, Byron White's majority opinion quoted Powell's criticism of the inflexible application of the rule in support of allowing good-faith exceptions. The next year, Thomas would himself cite Powell as to how the <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> could not be exercised in conflict with existing statutory or constitutional provisions in Thomas v. Arn, upholding a Sixth Circuit rule that required parties appealing a district court judgement to have filed timely written objections to a magistrate's report.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates whether {{different}} types of regulation may have a direct or indirect (through market power) impact on bank’s efficiency. We use a set of data containing European banks to consider the impact of regulations related to capital requirements, official <b>supervisory</b> <b>power,</b> restrictions on bank activities, and private monitoring on bank efficiency. Our results suggest that official <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> increase bank efficiency, activity restrictions and private monitoring reduce bank efficiency in general, but for banks with more market power these effects are all significantly positive. While stricter capital requirements in combination with more market power has {{a negative impact on}} bank efficiency. Our results also find a non-linear relationship between market power and bank efficiencies. Besides, the evidence of subsamples suggests that regulations will have different effect on bank efficiency in developed or developing countries...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates whether {{regulations}} {{have an independent}} effect on bank risk-taking or whether their effect is channeled through the market power possessed by banks. Given a well-established set of theoretical priors, the regulations considered are capital requirements, restrictions on bank activities and official <b>supervisory</b> <b>power.</b> We use data from the Central and Eastern European banking sectors over the period 1998 - 2005. The empirical results suggest that banks with market power tend to take on lower credit risk and have a lower probability of default. Capital requirements reduce risk in general, but for banks with market power this effect significantly weakens or can even be reversed. Higher activity restrictions in combination with more market power reduce both credit risk {{and the risk of}} default, while official <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> has only a direct impact on bank risk. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|This paper uses {{stochastic}} frontier {{analysis to}} provide international {{evidence on the}} impact of the regulatory and supervision framework on bank efficiency. Our dataset consists of 2853 observations from 615 publicly quoted commercial banks operating in 74 countries during the period 2000 - 2004. We investigate the impact of regulations related to the three pillars of Basel II (i. e. capital adequacy requirements, official <b>supervisory</b> <b>power,</b> and market discipline mechanisms), as well as restrictions on bank activities, on cost and profit efficiency of banks, while controlling for other country-specific characteristics. Our results suggest that banking regulations that enhance market discipline and empower the <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> of the authorities increase both cost and profit efficiency of banks. In contrast, stricter capital requirements improve cost efficiency but reduce profit efficiency, while restrictions on bank activities have the opposite effect, reducing cost efficiency but improving profit efficiency. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

5000|$|Prior to Payner, {{there had}} been {{arguments}} that the <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> should be thought of only as the judicial branch's self-policing ability. But, Carome argued, {{from the time the}} Court first invoked it in McNabb, [...] "it has been used to counteract improprieties of the executive branch that do not amount to constitutional violations." [...] Courts have also recognized that Congress can limit its application, and have used it sparingly, limiting the power's potential to upset the balance of powers. It also was not intrusive, checking the actions of the executive branch only insofar as it reached criminal prosecutions. Thus the exercise of the <b>supervisory</b> <b>power</b> is a refusal of the courts to participate in the illegalities of the executive branch in an effort to preserve their own integrity. It is not an attempt by the courts to dictate policy to the executive branch.|$|R
