40|$|We have {{investigated}} the photoprotective properties of induced pigmentation using erythema and epidermal DNA photodamage as endpoints. Previously unexposed buttock skin of 12 young, healthy adults (six <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> II and six <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> IV) was exposed daily (Monday to Friday) for 2 wk (days 1 – 12) with 0. 65 minimal erythema dose of solar simulated radiation. Mean <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> IV minimal erythema dose was 1. 8 -fold greater than for <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> II. Compared to <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> II, solar simulated radiation treatments produced less erythema and more tanning in <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> IV. To assess DNA photodamage, biopsies were taken and prepared for paraffin sections that were stained with a monoclonal antibody for thymine dimers. Thymine dimers were quantified by image analysis. The single exposure data (0. 65 and 2 minimal erythema dose) showed that DNA damage was related to physical dose (J per cm 2) independent of <b>skin</b> <b>type.</b> Our data also showed that DNA photodamage accumulates in both <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> with repeated, suberythemal doses of solar simulated radiation. On day 12, there were more thymine dimers in <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> IV than <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> II, again indicating that physical rather than biologic dose determines the level of DNA damage. Comparisons on days 12 and 19, however, showed a much greater loss of thymine dimers in <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> IV, suggesting better thymine dimer repair. Protection factors for erythema and thymine dimers were calculated and shown to be about 2 in both <b>skin</b> <b>types.</b> This provides further indirect evidence that DNA is a chromophore for erythema, but also suggests that a tan {{may not be the}} major factor in natural photoprotection...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the relationship between pain and <b>skin</b> <b>type,</b> the variation in pain intensity relative to the erythema of lesions caused by the erythematous effect of light, and the correlation between <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> and this redness. Other possible factors related to pain previously considered n the literature (type and location of lesion treated, sex, age) were also investigated. No statistical difference was found between the pain experienced by patients with one or two lesions and those with three or more lesions. Lesions located on the head and neck caused a greater degree of pain than those on the limbs and trunk. However, no statistical difference was evidenced between lesions on the trunk compared with limbs neither by different sexes In our study we found statistical confirmation that patients with <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> III perceived more pain than those with <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> IV. Correlating sex, <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> and age with the value of pain experienced, the highest level of pain was reported by women older than 65 years with <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> III.

40|$|Background: Vitamin D {{may play}} a {{protective}} role in many diseases. Public health messages are advocating sun avoidance to reduce skin cancer risk but the potential deleterious effects of these recommendations for vitamin D metabolism have been poorly investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated the association between 25 -hydroxy-vitamin D (25 (OH) D), <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> and ultraviolet exposure in 1414 Caucasian females in the UK. Mean age of the cohort was 47 years (18 – 79) and mean 25 (OH) D levels were 77 nmol/L (6 – 289). 25 (OH) D levels were strongly associated with season of sampling with higher levels {{in the spring and}} summer months (p, 0. 0001). Light <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> (<b>skin</b> <b>type</b> 1 and 2) have lower levels of 25 (OH) D (mean 71 nmol/L) compared to darker <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> (<b>skin</b> <b>type</b> 3 and 4) (mean 82 nmol/L) after adjusting for multiple confounders (p, 0. 0001). The trend for increasing risk of low vitamin D with fairer <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> was highly significant despite adjustment for all confounders (p = 0. 001). Conclusions/Significance: Contrary to previous studies across different ethnic backgrounds, this study within Caucasian UK females shows that fair <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> have lower levels of 25 (OH) D compared to darker <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> with potential detrimental health effects. Public health campaigns advocating sun avoidance in fair skinned individuals may need to be revised in vie...|$|R
40|$|Sites on {{previously}} unexposed buttock skin in 18 subjects (<b>skin</b> <b>types</b> I-V) {{were treated}} daily for 2 weeks with sub-erythemogenic doses of solar-simulated radiation (SSR) alone, SSR plus a UVB sunscreen, and SSR plus the same sunscreen with 5 -methoxypsoralen at 30 ppm. The three sites of treatment (designated SSR, SSR/S, and SSR/S/ 5 -MOP), and a control site that received no SSR or topical treatment, were challenged with 2 MED SSR 1 {{week after the}} treatment had ceased. Biopsy samples, taken within 15 min after the challenge dose, were assessed for unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS, interpreted {{as a measure of}} DNA damage), melanin deposition, and stratum corneum thickening. Within a given <b>skin</b> <b>type,</b> when compared with controls, the significant increase in either pigmentation or stratum corneum thickening was similar for SSR and SSR/S/ 5 -MOP. SSR/S inhibited these endpoints. Compared with controls, UDS was significantly reduced in <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> III-V by SSR and in all <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> by SSR/S/ 5 -MOP. SSR/S elicited no effect apart from minimal reductions in <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> IV and V. Thus, the increases in pigmentation and stratum corneum thickening seen in all <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> with SSR and SSR/S/ 5 -MOP were accompanied by reduced UDS in all <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> with SSR/S/ 5 -MOP but only in <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> III-V with SSR. These findings suggest that, although induced pigmentation and stratum corneum thickening may account in part for the reduction of UDS, qualitative differences in induced pigmentation may exist in <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> I-II between SSR and SSR/S/ 5 -MOP treatments. The findings can also be interpreted to indicate that SSR/S/ 5 -MOP treatment can afford protection against DNA damage from subsequent exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation. Risk-benefit considerations on the use of sunscreens with and without 5 -MOP are discussed and the conclusion is drawn that the judicious use of 5 -MOP sunscreens, particularly in <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> I-II, affords an alternative option to those seeking a suntan...|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of acne {{management}} for all patients is to select treatments that effectively address as many pathogenic factors as possible while minimizing side effects. Acne therapy in darker skin patients presents unique challenges due {{to differences in}} the risk of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, which may develop in response to acne itself or to irritation secondary to treatment. One combination treatment currently available is a gel formulation containing a retinoid (adapalene 0. 1 %) in fixed combination with an antimicrobial (benzoyl peroxide 2. 5 %). Results from three randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, clinical trials of adapalene-benzoyl peroxide were combined in a retrospective meta-analysis that included 909 patients treated for 12 weeks and assessed at each visit for erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning. Only Week 1 results were included in the meta-analysis because the worst severity of cutaneous irritation was found to occur at this timepoint in all three trials. For each study, and for the meta-analysis, comparisons were made using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. There were no statistically significant differences in dryness, scaling, and stinging/burning with adapalene-benzoyl peroxide treatment when subjects with Fitzpatrick <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> I to III were compared to subjects with Fitzpatrick <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> IV to VI (P=NS). Erythema assessments were statistically different based on <b>skin</b> <b>types,</b> as subjects with Fitzpatrick <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> IV to VI were rated as having “none” more often than those with Fitzpatrick <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> I to III (P< 0. 001). This could be due to the difficulty in visualizing erythema in patients with darker <b>skin</b> <b>types,</b> mainly Fitzpatrick <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> VI.

Eumelanin and pheomelanin are present in human hair and this study was carried out to whether both pigments are also present in human epidermis. Samples of epidermis were obtained from suction blisters raised in the upper arm of 13 Caucasian subjects of <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> I, II, and III and analyzed for both eumelanin and pheomelanin using a procedure involving high-performance liquid chromatography. Eumelanin and pheomelanin were found in all epidermal samples and their relative proportions correlated well with those found in samples of hair taken from the same subjects. The lowest concentrations of eumelanin were found in subjects of <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> I, with higher levels in <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> II and III. The concentrations of pheomelanin were more variable and showed no relationship to <b>skin</b> <b>type.</b> Increases in the concentrations of both pigments occurred following PUVA therapy, but whereas the largest increases in eumelanin were seen in <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> II and III, the increases in pheomelanin showed little relationship to <b>skin</b> <b>type.</b> Unlike eumelanin, epidermal pheomelanin also showed little relationship to induced tanning.

We determined {{the frequency of the}} val 92 met, asp 294 his, and asp 84 glu MC 1 R alleles in 190 Caucasian controls and 306 melanoma cases and studied their association with <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> and hair color. The percentage of controls with at least one val 92 met, asp 294 his, or asp 84 glu allele was 17. 3 %, 6. 8 %, and 3. 5 %, respectively. Individually, frequencies of the val 92 met, asp 294 his, or asp 84 glu alleles in the controls with <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> 3 and 4 were similar to those with <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> 1 and 2. Trend analysis, however, did identify an association (exact p = 0. 048, two-sided test) between <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> and MC 1 R variants in the group comprising all controls with any {{one or more of these}} alleles. There was no association between MC 1 R alleles and hair color. Allele frequencies were not different in melanoma cases and controls. There were no associations between <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> and the proportion of cases with the asp 294 his or asp 84 glu alleles, though the association between <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> and the val 92 met allele approached significance (exact p = 0. 09, two-sided test). Unexpectedly, in the group comprising all cases with one or more variant alleles, the proportion of subjects with variant alleles increased with <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> associated with tanning rather than burning, although trend analysis showed that this association did not quite reach statistical significance (exact p = 0. 08, two-sided test).

40|$|The {{question}} of whether melanins are photoprotecting and/or photosensitizing in human skin cells continues to be debated. To evaluate the role of melanin upon UVA irradiation, DNA single-strand breaks (ssb) were measured in human melanocytes differing only {{in the amount of}} pigment produced by culturing at two different concentrations, basic (0. 01 mM) or high (0. 2 mM), of L-tyrosine, the main precursor of melanin. In parallel, pheo- and total melanin contents of the cells were determined. Identical experiments were performed with two melanocyte cultures derived from a <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> I and a <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> VI individual. For the first time the correlation between UVA-induced genotoxicity and pheo-/total melanin content has been investigated. We observed that cultured in basic medium, the <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> VI melanocytes contained 10 times more total melanin and about seven times more pheomelanin than the <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> I melanocytes. Elevation of tyrosine level in the culture medium resulted in an increase of both pheo- and total melanin levels in both melanocyte cultures; however, the melanin composition of <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> I melanocytes became more pheomelanogenic, whereas that of <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> VI melanocytes remained the same. The <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> VI melanocytes cultured in basic medium demonstrated a very high sensitivity (1. 18 ssb per 1010 Da per kJ per m 2) toward UVA that is probably related to their high pheo- and total melanin content. Their UVA sensitivity, however, did not change after increasing their melanin content by culturing at high tyrosine concentration. In contrast, the <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> I melanocytes demonstrated a low sensitivity (0. 04 ssb per 1010 Da per kJ per m 2) toward UVA when cultured in basic medium, but increasing their melanin content resulted in a 3 -fold increase in their UVA sensitivity (0. 13 ssb per 1010 Da per kJ per m 2). These results demonstrate that UVA-irradiated cultured human melanocytes are photosensitized by their own synthesized chromophores, most likely pheomelanin and/or melanin intermediates...|$|R

Subjects with <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> I, II, or III were exposed to two or three minimal erythema doses of irradiation from a solar simulator. Biopsies were taken from nonexposed and irradiated skin 24 and 96 h after irradiation and protease-activated receptor 2 expression was detected using immunohistochemical staining. In nonirradiated skin, protease-activated receptor 2 expression was confined to keratinocytes in the lower one-third of the epidermis. After ultraviolet irradiation protease-activated receptor 2 expression was observed in keratinocytes in the upper two-thirds of the epidermis or the entire epidermis at both time points studied. Subjects with <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> I showed delayed upregulation of protease-activated receptor 2 expression, however, compared with subjects with <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> II and III.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of visible light on the immediate pigmentation and delayed tanning of melanocompetent skin; the results were compared with those induced by long-wavelength UVA (UVA 1). Two electromagnetic radiation sources were used to irradiate the lower back of 20 volunteers with <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> IV–VI: UVA 1 (340 – 400 nm) and visible light (400 – 700 nm). Pigmentation was assessed by visual examination, digital photography with a cross-polarized filter, and diffused reflectance spectroscopy at 7 time points over a 2 -week period. Confocal microscopy and skin biopsies for histopathological examination using different stains were carried out. Irradiation was also carried out on <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> II. Results showed that although both UVA 1 and visible light can induce pigmentation in <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> IV–VI, pigmentation induced by visible light was darker and more sustained. No pigmentation was observed in <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> II. The quality and quantity of pigment induced by visible light and UVA 1 were different. These findings have potential implications on the management of photoaggravated pigmentary disorders, the proper use of sunscreens, and the treatment of depigmented lesions...|$|R

5000|$|Masks can {{be found}} {{anywhere}} from drugstores to department stores, and can vary in consistency and form. Setting masks include: clay, which is a thicker consistency, and will draw out impurities (and sometimes, natural oils, too) from the pores; a cream, which stays damp to hydrate the skin; sheet-style, in which a paper mask is dampened with liquid to tone and moisturize the skin; and lastly, a hybrid/clay and cream form that includes small beads for removing dead surface skin cells. Non-setting facial masks include warm oil and paraffin wax masks. These different forms are made to suit different <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> (e.g., oily or dry), and different skincare goals or needs (e.g., moisturizing, cleansing, exfoliating). Clay and mud masks suit oily and some [...] "combination" [...] <b>skin</b> <b>types,</b> while cream-based masks tend to suit dry and sensitive <b>skin</b> <b>types.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Toners {{are used}} after {{cleansing}} {{the skin to}} freshen it up, boost the appearance of one's complexion, and remove any traces of cleanser, mask, or makeup, as well to help restore the skin's natural pH. They are usually applied to a cotton pad and wiped over the skin, but can be sprayed onto the skin from a spray bottle. Toners typically contain alcohol, water, and herbal extracts or other chemicals depending on <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> whether oily, dry, or combination. Toners containing alcohol are quite astringent, and usually targeted at oily skins. Dry or normal skin should be treated with alcohol-free toners. Witch hazel solution is a popular toner for all <b>skin</b> <b>types,</b> but many other products are available. Many toners contain salicylic acid and/or benzoyl peroxide. These types of toners are targeted at oily <b>skin</b> <b>types,</b> as well as acne-prone skin.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This {{correspondence}} {{focuses on}} a significant distinction between two hierarchical <b>type</b> <b>covering</b> strategies, namely, weak and strong covering, and {{on the impact of}} this distinction on known results. In particular, it is demonstrated that the rate region for weak covering, whose natural use is in scalable source coding, is generally larger than the rate region for strong covering, which is primarily useful in hierarchical guessing. This correspondence also presents a corrected converse result for the hierarchical guessing problem.

40|$|Twenty-five {{patients}} with extensive psoriasis {{were randomly assigned}} {{into one of the}} three groups, each receiving 0. 5 mg/kg of oral liquid methoxsalen photochemotherapy followed 1 h later by exposure to long-wave ultraviolet light (UVA). The sole difference between the three groups was the method used to determine the initial UVA dose, which was either based on <b>skin</b> <b>type,</b> 25 % of the minimal phototoxic dose (MPD), or 50 % of the MPD. All patients were treated in the Phototherapy Unit at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Data were obtained until reaching the endpoint of clearance. At clearance, the results of the number of treatments required to clea, final UVA dose, cumulative UVA dose, and side effects were tabulated, compared, and analysed {{for each of the three}} groups. The 25 % and 50 % MPD groups required a mean of 15. 0 ± 1. 7 % and 13. 4 ± 1. 9 treatments to clear, respectively, as compared to the <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> group, which needed an average of 17. 6 ± 2. 5 treatments. The mean final UVA dose was 7. 4 ± 0. 9 J/cm 2 for the 25 % and 50 % MPD groups respectively, in contrast to 11. 6 ± J/cm 2 for the <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> group. The mean cumulative UVA dose at clearance for the 25 % and 50 % MPD groups was 79 ± 16 J/cm 2 and 87 ± 27 J/cm 2, respectively, versus 136 ± 30 J/cm 2 for the <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> group. The comparisons between the individual MPD groups and the <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> group did not achieve statistical significance with the exception of a marginally significant difference in final dose between the <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> group and the 25 % MPD group (p = 0. 06). However, the results of the two MPD group were then pooled ant the mean final (7. 9 ± 0. 8 J/cm 2) and cumulative (83 ± 15 J/cm 2) UVA doses were significantly (p = 0. 04) and marginally significantly (p = 0. 07) lower than the respective means of the <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> group, did not attain statistical significance (p = 0. 19). Our data suggest that the MPD measurement may be superior to the skin-typing system when calculating the initial UVA dose in oral liquid methoxsalen photochemotherapy for the treatment of psoriasis...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of sublative fractional bipolar radiofrequency and bipolar radio frequency combined with diode laser {{for the treatment of}} both superficial and deep acne scars in patients with <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> II to V. Design: Prospective, single-center study. Subjects received up to five treatments with sublative fractional bipolar radiofrequency and bipolar radiofrequency combined with diode laser. Treatments were directed to at least two facial (forehead, perioral, cheeks) and/or neck areas with acne scars at four-week intervals. Treatment parameters on each subject were based on <b>skin</b> <b>type</b> and on <b>skin</b> responses to test spots on the target area just before treatment. Setting: Physician office. Participants: Subjects (n= 20, aged 40. 7 ± 10. 5 years [mean ± SD], <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> II–V) with acne scars and without acne lesions enrolled in this prospective study. Measurements: Results were evaluated just before each treatment and at four and 12 weeks after the final treatment using the Goodman Scar Scale, a quantitative method of evaluating scars that attempts to reduce grading subjectivity, as well as by patient satisfaction. Results: Acne scars improved significantly one month after three treatments and improvement persisted for at least 12 weeks after the fifth treatment. Improvement was not affected by <b>skin</b> <b>type.</b> Adverse effects were limited to transient erythema and edema. Conclusion: The combination of diode laser and bipolar radiofrequency energy device in addition to fractionated sublative radiofrequency is a safe and statistically significantly effective combined modality for the treatment of both superficial and deep acne scars in patients with <b>skin</b> <b>types</b> II to V with minimal downtime and no significant side effects...|$|R
