Firstly, the bionic design method for <b>stiffener</b> <b>plate</b> structure was established based on distribution principles of gingko root system. The bionic design method was used to improve column structure of the gantry machining center, and three kinds of bionic columns were put forward. The finite element analysis on original and bionic columns indicates that {{the mass of the}} column with the best bionic <b>stiffener</b> <b>plate</b> structure is reduced by 2. 74 % and the first five order natural frequencies are increased by 6. 62 % on average. The correctness of column's bionic design method proposed in this paper was verified by the static and dynamic experiments. Finally, the bionic principles for <b>stiffener</b> <b>plate</b> of column were concluded, which provides a new idea for updating traditional design concepts and achieving lightweight structure of machine tool components...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{permeable}} membrane to mechanically constrain a film {{of water}} with an area of 12 cm 2 and a thickness of 150 tm in a gas/liquid contactor was investigated. The membrane separated the vapor and liquid phases, and a <b>stiffener</b> <b>plate</b> made from a gas-permeable material was used to support the membrane. A design evaluation for the <b>stiffener</b> <b>plate</b> was conducted using finite-element modeling. A film thickness measurement system was developed that utilized a laser triangulation sensor mounted {{on a pair of}} motorized stages. The laser imaged both the membrane and a series of NiCr-coated regions on the liquid side of a quartz viewing window, with the difference between adjacent distance readings to the two surfaces constituting a measurement of the local film thickness. Refraction effects were corrected for using both an analytical and an empirical method. The film was approximately uniform in thickness at room temperature, but thickened by 30 to 50 percent at the downstream end when the device was operated near 70 °C. The film became unstable at low pressure differentials across the membrane. Redacted for privacy ©Copyright by Jerrod P. Peterso...|$|E

Static and dynamic aeroelastic stability can be altered by these couplings. It is therefore necessary to use an accurate and computationally efficient beam model during the preliminary design phase. A stiffened box, made of isotropic material, but with the stiffeners oriented so that they originate the expected bending/torsion coupling, is considered in the present work. The overall equivalent bending, torsional and coupled stiffness is derived by means of homogenization of the shell skin and of the <b>stiffener</b> <b>plate</b> stiffness. A new equivalent homogeneous orthotropic material is determined and introduced into the equivalent plate configuration.

The removal of equipment will utilize portions of the Equipment Removal System for Project W 320 (ERS-W 320), specifically the 50 ton hydraulic trailer system. Because the ERS-W 320 system was designed to accommodate much heavier equipment it is adequate to support the dead weight of the trough, carriage and related equipment for 241 AZ 101 pump removal project. However, the ERS-W 320 components when combined with the trough and its` related components must also be analyzed for overturning due to wind loads.

The contribution of {{precast concrete}} infill panels to the lateral stiffness and strength of steel frames can be significant depending on the quality, quantity and location of the discrete interface connections. This paper presents preliminary experimental and finite element results of {{an investigation into the}} composite behaviour of a square steel frame with a precast concrete infill panel subject to lateral loading. The panel is connected at the corners {{to the ends of the}} top and bottom beams. The Frame-to-Panel-Connection, FPC 4 between steel beam and concrete panel consists of two parts. A T-section with five achor bars welded to the top of the flange is cast in at the panel corner at a forty five degree angle. The triangularly shaped web of the T-section is reinforced against local buckling with a <b>stiffener</b> <b>plate.</b> The second part consists of a triangular gusset plate which is welded to the beam flange. Two bolts acting in shear connect the gusset plate to the web of the T-section. This way the connection can act in tension or compression. Experimental pull-out tests on individual connections allowed their load deflection characteristics to be established. A full scale experiment was performed on a one-storey one-bay 3 by 3 m infilled frame structure which was horizontally loaded at the top. With the characteristics of the frame-to-panel connections obtained from the experiments on individual connections, finite element analyses were performed on the infilled frame structures taking geometric and material non-linear behaviour of the structural components into account. The finite element model yields reasonably accurate results. This allows the model to be used for further parametric studies. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆e 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} investigation of end plate connections of various thicknesses welded to 10 WF 21 and 12 WF 27 beams and connected to various stiffened and unstiffened 8 WF columns are reported. Moment-rotation curves have been obtained for all connections tested and these have been compared {{to determine the effects}} on connection performance of the parameters of end plate thickness, column section, and column <b>stiffener</b> <b>plates.</b> Yield beam lines, representing first yield in a uniformly loaded beam, were drawn to obtain the connection moment at the yield beam line. The value of this moment indicated that the connections behaved semi-rigidly and was used in the comparison of various connections. It was observed that the thicker the end plate, the more rigid the connection and the greater the effect of column stiffeners on the rigidity of the connection. For an end plate connection of a particular width and depth connected to a particular column, there is a limiting moment which such a connection can sustain at the yield beam line, regardless of the thickness of end plate used. This limiting effect is due to deformation of the column section, specifically, of the column flange. Column <b>stiffener</b> <b>plates</b> increased the rigidity of all connections primarily by restraining the deformation of the column flanges adjacent to the tension flanges beams. Column stiffeners prevented column web bucking, however the column web buckles which developed in these tests were initiated at rotations greatly exceeding those expected in structural forms...|$|R

40|$|This study {{discusses}} a HS- 75 profile {{which has}} a thickness of 0. 8 mm. The aim to observe this profile {{is to get the}} information whether this profile could replace timber as a house roof frame or not. This profile was observed in three different conditions. The first condition is analyzing the profile without any <b>stiffener</b> <b>plate</b> attach. The second condition is by attaching one diaphragm plate on the middle of the HS- 75 beam, and the last observed object is a HS- 75 beam with three diaphragm plate attach on certain places along the beam. The modeling and simulation of HS- 75 is important to predict the actual strength or some other properties such as strain, deflection or deformation. In this study, strength analysis of HS- 75 is simulated using finite element method (FEM). The profile strength analysis is simulated on three different combinations of diaphragm plate commonly designed for house roof frame. The HS- 75 being analyzed is the beam total deformation. The first step in preparing the simulation is producing the HS- 75 product using the Ansys workbench software. Some HS- 75 properties should also be attached, such as the Young modulus, the Poison Ratio and the Tensile Ultimate Strength value. The HS- 75 beam being simulated has a length of 1800 mm, and a plate thickness of 0. 08 mm. The second step is dividing the beam in small part as meshing of the beam. The next step is attaching the loads work out on the beam. The last process is simulating the product by analyzing the directional deformation and the total deformation. FEM static stress analysis is also simulated on three different beam conditions. The results showed that the greater the load given to a light steel beam, then the deflection that occurs will also be greater. Based on the type of treatment conditions on HS- 75 light steel {{it was found that the}} deflection occurs at a maximum load of 6500 N is 14. 346 mm (without diaphragm plate), 6. 5094 mm (one diaphragm plate attached) and 6. 159 mm (three diaphragm plates attached). It can be concluded that the HS- 75 light steel profile which uses three diaphragm plates has a greater strength compared to the light steel profiles using one diaphragm plate and light steel profile without a diaphragm plate. This methodology serves as a novel approach for HS- 75 design evaluation, and the study of beam stress behavior in profiles which is needed in home properties industrie...|$|E

Successive ship alterations which addressed these issues with <b>stiffener</b> <b>plates,</b> frames, stringers, braces and even turbine blade redesign had limited success. Likely it was this consideration which influenced the RN's decision to dispose of their four surviving Tribal destroyers before 1950 even though none of those ships were then more than 12 years old. As the years passed all of Canada's Tribals, both British and Canadian built, developed more frequent and more extensive structural defects necessitating increasingly long yard time for repairs and restrictions placed on their employment. Eventually, the growing cost of their maintenance and their demands on the Navy's restricted manpower no longer could be justified by their decreased capabilities. Thus, in late 1963 the RCN decided to retire the entire class. Micmac finally paid off to disposal in March 1964 along with her sisters.

40|$|Cold-formed steel Lipped Channel Beams (LCB) with web {{openings}} {{are commonly}} used as floor joists and bearers in building structures. Shear behaviour of these beams is more complicated and their shear capacities are considerably reduced {{by the presence of}} web openings. Hence detailed numerical and experimental studies of simply supported LCBs under a mid-span load with aspect ratios of 1. 0 and 1. 5 were undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour and strength of LCBs with web openings. Experimental and numerical results showed that the current design rules in cold-formed steel structures design codes are very conservative. Improved design equations were therefore proposed for the shear strength of LCBs with web openings based on both experimental and numerical results. This research showed a significant reduction in shear capacities of LCBs when large web openings are included for the purpose of locating building services. A cost effective method of eliminating such detrimental effects of large circular web openings was also therefore investigated using experimental and numerical studies.

The second case considers the time and cost analysis of <b>stiffeners</b> cutting, steel <b>plates</b> and <b>stiffeners</b> assembly and welding, associated with the building of several blocks of an 80 m fisheries supporting vessel by JOPERINOX Shipyard at Alverca, Portugal, 2008...|$|R
40|$|Most {{structures}} {{especially the}} conventional steel buildings are usually using the simple design and rigid design methods. However, the actual behaviour {{is known to}} fall between these two extreme categories. The use of partial strength connections has been encouraged by studies on the matter. It is proven that it reduces the steel weight in use and thus save the overall construction cost. This project is to analyze the behaviour of trapezoidal web beam profiled to the end plate connection. Comparison between the effect of trapezoidal web beam profiled to end <b>plate</b> connection and <b>stiffener</b> is made to predict the strength, stiffness and rotational capacity of the connections. Previous {{research shows that the}} trapezoidal web beam profiled will minimize the need of stiffeners. Six models have been analyzed in this project by using LUSAS 14. 0 by various type of beam. The dimension of beam is 150 x 200 x 1600 mm whereas for column is 200 x 200 x 1800 mm. The dimension for the end <b>plate</b> <b>stiffener</b> provided is 95 x 95 x 10 mm. Linear analysis is performed to obtain the deformed mesh, maximum stress and strain under axial load. In addition, a non-linear contact analysis is also done to obtain the relationship of the load-deflection at contact surfaces. The results show that the trapezoidal web beam profiled with end <b>plate</b> <b>stiffener</b> and extended end plate connection provide highest strength compared to others and with least deflection under loads...|$|R
