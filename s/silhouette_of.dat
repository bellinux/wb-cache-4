5|$|When {{early in}} the film {{newspaper}} clippings {{from around the globe}} are shown, in the Japanese newspaper the iconic <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> Godzilla is clearly visible. Similarly, during the New York sequence when Sky Captain deploys a bomb to stop a giant robot, the shape of King Kong can be seen on the Empire State Building in the background.|$|E
5|$|In shots {{where there}} was no {{perspective}} change, still shots of the models were photographed and positive paper prints were made. The image of the model was cut out of the photographic print and mounted on glass and filmed on an animation stand. The undeveloped film was re-wound to film the star background with the <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> the model photograph acting as a matte to block out where the spaceship image was.|$|E
5|$|Mulder, still {{restrained}} {{in his bed}} at the hospital, {{sees the}} <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> the monster at the window. He screams for the nurse, but she has already been bitten and opens the window to let the monster in. Scully tries to visit Mulder but the nurse refuses access. Suddenly Scully sees the nurse as a corpse, realizes that Mulder is in danger, and runs into Mulder's room. There she sees the monster {{on the wall and}} shoots at it. It leaps through the partially open window, breaking the glass and wooden frame.|$|E

5|$|Tandy {{drew the}} inside {{sketches}} {{for the first}} 26 volumes of the series as well as painting the covers of the first 26 volumes {{with the exception of}} volume 11– the cover artist for volume 11 is unknown. Tandy read each text before he began sketching, so his early covers were closely connected to specific scenes in the plots. He also hand-painted the cover lettering and designed the original Nancy Drew logo: a <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> Nancy bending slightly and looking at the ground through a quizzing glass.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{the bicentennial}} celebration of the battle, in 2015 Belgium minted a 2 Euro coin {{depicting}} the Lion monument over {{a map of the}} field of battle. France officially protested this issue, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo. After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted. Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2½ Euros. Legally only valid within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 Euros. A 10 Euro coin, showing Wellington, Blücher, their troops and the <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> Napoleon, was also available in silver for 42 Euros.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus {{was first}} {{described}} under its current binomial name by English ornithologist Marmaduke Tunstall in his 1771 work Ornithologia Britannica. The scientific name Falco peregrinus is a Medieval Latin phrase {{that was used}} by Albertus Magnus in 1225. The specific name taken {{from the fact that}} juvenile birds were taken while journeying to their breeding location rather than from the nest, as falcon nests were difficult to get at. The Latin term for falcon, falco, is related to falx, the Latin word meaning sickle, in reference to the <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> the falcon's long, pointed wings in flight.|$|E

5|$|In his book, German Architecture in China, Warner Torsten {{writes of}} the cathedral: According to residents] the cathedral {{is far too}} large for the scale of Qingdao. Its {{position}} {{on top of a}} hill makes this even more evident. Perhaps the idea was to produce a powerful building to hold its own with the Protestant Church, which for 20 years had been the largest religious building in Qingdao, or perhaps the intention was to outstrip the 46metre-high towers of the Franciscan church in Jinan. The towers of the cathedral in Qingdao were higher than all the other churches in the major cities of Northern China– Tianjin, Beijing, Dalian, or Jinan. They dominate the <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> Qingdao; they are particularly impressive from a ship entering the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Set {{apart from}} the glowing underside, the darker, nonluminescent collar tapers at {{both sides of the}} throat, and has been {{hypothesized}} to serve as a lure by mimicking the <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> a small fish from below. The appeal of the lure would be multiplied in a school of sharks. If the collar does function in this way, the cookiecutter shark would be the only known case of bioluminescence in which the absence of light attracts prey, while its photophores serve to prevent premature detection by incoming would-be predators. As the shark can only match a limited range of light intensities, its vertical movements likely serve to preserve the effectiveness of its disguise across various times of day and weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|The Quarrymen—John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ken Brown—went to {{the club}} to arrange their first booking, to which Mona agreed, but said she needed to finish {{painting}} the club first. All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish painting the walls with spiders, dragons, rainbows and stars. In addition to the four boys' artistic contributions, Cynthia Powell, later to become Cynthia Lennon, painted a <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> John on the wall, which can still be seen today. The group often played at The Casbah as other venues, like The Cavern Club, had a jazz-only policy at that time. The cellar—with its original decoration—still exists.|$|E

5|$|Arhys informs Daryus that Gabriel {{will be at}} Heaven's Cove {{that night}} ("Moment of Betrayal"). While the meeting time {{approaches}} ("Heaven's Cove"), Faythe decides {{that she wants to}} use the power of her royal status to change the world for good ("Begin Again"). At the amphitheater, Arhys changes his mind on the deal, and when Daryus shows up, they start a fight. Daryus overpowers Arhys and kills him ("The Path That Divides"), unaware that Xander followed them and saw the whole scene. As Xander runs to his father's dead body, Daryus sees the <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> someone approaching him. Assuming it to be Gabriel, he attempts to kill him, realising too late that it is actually Faythe ("The Walking Shadow"). Gabriel arrives at the scene and sees his dead brother and the dying Faythe. Covering Xander's ears, he unleashes a scream that causes Daryus to go deaf and that is heard by Nafaryus, Arabelle, and the entire town ("My Last Farewell").|$|E
5|$|During the {{original}} era the Panthers {{did not have}} a logo, instead using stylised lettering on the front of their shirts. The club's current logo was adopted in 2003 and is the fifth to be used since the Panthers were reformed. The first was used between 1980 and 1994 and was the <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> a Panthers' head in a red circle. The second logo, adopted in 1994, was similar to the first but used a more detailed Panthers' head. The third logo, introduced in 1998, featured a keyhole shaped like the head of a cat with a Panther reaching through it. The fourth logo was adopted following the move to the National Ice Centre and was similar to the logo of German side Augsburger Panther. The stylised lettering used during {{the original}} era was used again on special shirts made to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the club in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Mona had booked the Les Stewart Quartet to {{play the}} opening night with Harrison on guitar, but they {{cancelled}} the booking after Stewart and Brown had a quarrel. Stewart was angry that Brown had missed a rehearsal, because Brown was helping Mona to decorate the club. As 300 membership cards had already been sold, Harrison {{said that he had}} two friends in a band called The Quarrymen who would play instead. Lennon, McCartney, Stuart Sutcliffe and Harrison went to the club to arrange the booking, to which Mona agreed, but said she needed to finish painting the club first. All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish painting the walls with spiders, dragons, rainbows, stars, and a beetle, which still survive. John Lennon was short-sighted, mistaking gloss for emulsion paint, which {{took a long time to}} dry in the dark, damp cellar. Cynthia Powell, later the wife of Lennon, painted a <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> John Lennon on the wall, which is also still intact.|$|E

5|$|The {{large number}} of {{denominations}} issued in late-2008 {{as well as the}} suspension of paper supply by Giesecke & Devrient affected the Reserve Bank's ability to maintain the quality of the banknotes. Later denominations copied design features from the original 2007 banknote series and lacked many modern security features that banknotes of major currencies (such as the Canadian Dollar) relied on. The notes denominated from $20000 to $500000 and then from $10 million onwards used non-watermarked paper, whilst the $500 million notes were printed on pure cotton. A <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> the Zimbabwe Bird in Optically Variable Ink was used in such notes to compensate for this, but the iridescent strip was dropped for higher denominations. The $10000 and $1000000 notes reused paper for the $1000 notes (Pick no. 72), thereby carrying the embedded holographic thread and watermark. Two types of paper (regular and lined) were used on $20000, $50000 and $500000 banknotes.|$|E
5|$|The mace: The mace of Fordham is {{traditionally}} carried at Commencement {{by the president}} of the Faculty Senate, who serves as the grand marshal of the main academic procession. The device, four feet in length, bears a regal crown at the summit to denote the sole power of the State of New York to grant academic degrees in its territory. Above the crown is a cross composed of four windmill sails, which signify the Catholic faith and the Dutch founders of New York City, respectively. The center of the cross displays a heraldic rose, which symbolizes Rose Hill. Immediately beneath the crown is a support, on which the university's seal is emblazoned. The upper node of the mace's staff is decorated with three heraldic roses, the Fordham seal, a ram's head, and a <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> the Lincoln Center campus. The titles of the university's constituent colleges are engraved above the node, and the names of the school's presidents from 1841 to 1966 are inscribed below it. The mace was a gift to the university from the Fordham University Alumni Federation.|$|E
5|$|In the Catch 'Em Mode, players must {{reveal a}} <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> a Pokémon by hitting bumpers. Once it is revealed, players must hit the Pokémon that appears three {{times with the}} ball as it sits in one spot before the time runs out. Egg Mode is a similar concept, though the baby Pokémon roam around the board as opposed to {{standard}} Pokémon, which stand still. As opposed to being timed, players must capture it before it returns from whence it came. Evolution Mode is also similar, requiring players to hit all of the evolution item markers in order to evolve their Pokémon that they have caught or hatched. These include several traditional means of evolution in the Pokémon series, such as stones and experience points. Lastly, Travel Mode allows players to leave the current location on their pinball board, allowing them to capture more kinds of Pokémon {{not found in the}} current area. Ruby & Sapphire featured additional bonus modes that often diverge from the standard gameplay. These modes sometimes feature rare Pokémon such as Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza, and take place on separate fields. Outside of the gameplay, players may also view the Pokémon they have caught, listen to sound effects and music from the game, and view their high scores for each board.|$|E
