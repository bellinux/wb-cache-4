5|$|Marsden reappears on Albert Square in 2009 when Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) is murdered. She {{arrives on}} the scene when several people say they suspect Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), but Marsden waits before {{questioning}} her, and questions the Mitchells first. She makes a televised appeal for witnesses and later interviews Phil, but he is provided an alibi by his girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). A few days later, a red fingernail is found {{at the scene of}} the murder; Marsden visits the female locals, checking their hands. Seeing an upset Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), knowing that she is vulnerable and lives with Shirley, she talks to Heather about Christmas Day and Heather accidentally tells Marsden that Phil wasn't there. Marsden interviews Phil and later visits his home, asking to see the clothes he was wearing on Christmas Day. Shirley shows her a clean shirt; Marsden closes the laundrette, hoping anyone with blood-stained clothes will not be able to wash them. After a tip-off Marsden arrests Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook); Sam accuses her mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), of the murder. Marsden confirms that she was there to talk to Peggy, questioning Peggy and Sam at the police station. Peggy is released without charge; however, Sam is detained for jumping bail. Marsden visits Janine, who insists that people will <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> get her in trouble. She asks Janine why she was out in the cold on Christmas Day, and asks if Janine knows where Archie's laptop as it had gone missing.|$|E

25|$|Otto Berman, {{the oldest}} and least {{physically}} fit of the four men, {{was the first to}} die, at 2:20 that morning. At the hospital, Landau and Rosencrantz waited for surgery and refused to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> the police until Schultz arrived and gave them permission; even then, they provided the police with only minimal information. Abe Landau died of exsanguination eight hours after the shooting. Meanwhile, Rosencrantz was taken into surgery; the doctors, incredulous that Rosencrantz was still alive despite voluminous blood loss and ballistic trauma, were unsure of how to treat him. He survived for 29 hours after the shooting before succumbing to his injuries.|$|E
25|$|Kathy returns a {{few days}} later and meets with Ben, who is furious to see her again after several years of believing she was dead. He angrily {{declares}} that her absence is to blame for the current state of his life, declaring that he is the reason Phil has left due to his homosexuality, but Kathy tells him that she and Phil knew that he was gay before he even started school, and that they have always loved him. Ian later decides to rebuild his relationship with his mother and allows Kathy to move into his house. Gavin meets Kathy in Walford and reveals that he has kidnapped Phil and threatens to kill him if she does not follow his instructions and give him money. Kathy and Ben reluctantly agree to give into Gavin's demands, but after trying to steal Ian's safe, Kathy decides not to do so. Ian later tells Kathy that her grandson Bobby Beale (Elliot Carrington) killed Lucy. Kathy, after seeing Ben drunk and angry at her, confesses to Ian that she is still on the run and she and Ben were planning to con him as Gavin has kidnapped Phil, so Ian throws her out, thinking she cares more about Phil than him. Jane is horrified that he told Kathy about Bobby, but Ian is confident she will not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> the police. Kathy then goes to the police station to report the kidnapping, while Ben tells Ian what Gavin has done. Ian contacts Gavin, telling him he knows what he has been doing. It is subsequently revealed that he has been keeping Phil locked in his closet, but by the time Kathy and the police come to his house looking for him, he is not there although a fresh blood stain is found in the kitchen. Kathy later tells the Beales what she has done, and Sharon is incensed when she finds out the truth, insisting none of it would have happened if Kathy had not returned. Phil returns home severely injured and Ian allows Kathy to move back into his house. Gavin later holds Kathy, Ben and Phil hostage in their house and when Sharon confronts him, he reveals himself as her father before fleeing. Kathy is given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to fraud.|$|E
500|$|The {{events of}} the {{assassination}} resulted in speculation, then and subsequently, concerning Johnson and what the conspirators might have intended for him. In the vain hope of having his life spared after his capture, Atzerodt spoke much about the conspiracy, but did not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> indicate that the plotted assassination of Johnson was merely a ruse. Conspiracy theorists {{point to the fact}} that {{on the day of the}} assassination, Booth came to the Kirkwood House and left one of his cards.

When Ganesan asked the reason for including it, Arur Doss mentioned that Ganesan's character would be looked upon by the theatre audiences in a negative light if he did not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> confirm his love for Saroja Devi's character. Understanding the dialogue's essence, Mirasi then re-filmed the climax and included it. The film was processed at Gemini Studios' laboratory. The final length of the film was over [...]|$|E

When Sarah forwarded an unrelated letter from her husband to Anne, with a covering note continuing the argument, Anne wrote back pointedly, [...] "After the commands you gave me on the thanksgiving day of not answering you, I should not have troubled you with these lines, but to return the Duke of Marlborough's letter safe into your hands, and {{for the same reason}} do not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> that, nor to yours which enclosed it." ...|$|E

500|$|A 2011 {{article in}} New York Magazine {{described}} {{the company as}} the [...] "largest and indisputably weirdest hedge fund" [...] because of its unwavering commitment to [...] "total honesty and accountability" [...] and minute detail in its corporate culture. For example, Dalio encourages employees to do [...] "whatever {{it takes to make}} the company great" [...] and emphasizes transparency and openness in its decision making processes. All meetings are recorded and can be viewed by any employee as long as the meeting topic is not proprietary. In addition, Dalio says that he fosters [...] "an extreme meritocracy of ideas" [...] and asserts that decisions are made about investments without considerations of hierarchy. He says that any employee can respectfully <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> anyone in the firm, but they must be prepared to be challenged in return. The company's flat corporate structure aims to remove the barriers associated with traditional asset management firms, and qualities like stodginess and risk-aversion are discouraged.|$|E
500|$|It is then {{revealed}} that Kylie has a son, Max (Harry McDermott), {{who is in}} foster care. Lane said that this happened because Kylie [...] "was drinking with his dad and not looking after him". Kylie loves Max but is too [...] "young and naive" [...] too cope with motherhood. Kylie snatches Max while on a visit; Lane opined it was a {{spur of the moment}} decision, but [...] "she couldn't bear to lose him". Becky helps Kylie regain custody of him. The [...] "turning point" [...] in the storyline was attributed to scenes in which Kylie stands up in court and vows to change. Lane said that they were [...] "touching" [...] scenes, which included a rare moment in which Kylie applauds Becky for being [...] "a great sister". Lane stated that when she gets Max back, Kylie takes advantage of Becky. In another storyline Kylie makes a pass at Steve. Gregson who plays him opined that in Kylie's mind she thought [...] "that fat bald guy wants a bit". He also said that Steve was [...] "extremely shocked" [...] but was not interested. Steve decides not to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> Becky because he doesn't trust Kylie and knows that she will take Max away from Becky.

Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) comes along as the HR representative, against Michael's protests. The deposition goes well for Jan at first, as she claims that she was terminated due to discrimination over her breast augmentation. To counter evidence that she had a romantic relationship with Michael before they disclosed it to corporate, Jan submits Michael's personal diary, which she brought to the deposition without his knowledge or permission. Michael is further incensed against Jan when he learns that she gave him a scathing performance review after they had begun dating, claiming that he is unfit for his current position and should be demoted to sales. Michael learns he was never a contender when interviewing for Jan's former position at the corporate office, with the CFO insisting repeatedly that he is a nice guy, but ultimately unsuited for the position. Michael defends the company anyway, and later states that [...] "you expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend." [...] Jan and Michael drive home, clearly angry at each other over the events of the day.|$|E
