25|$|The town {{agent was}} in charge of the company town. The town agent oversaw {{departments}} including street and building maintenance, gas and water works, and fire protection. The town agent also oversaw businesses including the hotel, <b>sewage</b> <b>farm,</b> as well as the nursery and greenhouse. Under the town agent there were nine department heads and approximately 300 men under them. All company town officials were selected by Pullman. There were no elections in the company town besides elections for the school board.|$|E
25|$|As Melbourne prospered, its wealthy classes {{discovered}} the recreational uses of Port Phillip. Bayside suburbs such as St Kilda and Brighton were established {{on the east}} shore of the bay. Later, resorts further south such as Sorrento and Portsea became popular. The more swampy western shores of the bay were not so favoured, and have been used mainly for non-residential purposes such as the Point Cook Royal Australian Air Force base and the Werribee <b>Sewage</b> <b>Farm.</b> In recent decades the population along {{the western side of}} the bay has grown more rapidly.|$|E

25|$|In 1854, Alexander McDougall and Angus Smith {{developed}} and patented a product called McDougall's Powder as a sewer deodorant; it was mainly composed from carbolic acid derived from creosote. McDougall, in 1864, experimented with his solution to remove entozoa parasites from cattle pasturing on a <b>sewage</b> <b>farm.</b> This later led to {{widespread use of}} creosote as a cattle wash and sheep dip. External parasites would be killed in a creosote diluted dip, and drenching tubes {{would be used to}} administer doses to the animals' stomachs to kill internal parasites.|$|E
25|$|Swan Bay, {{adjacent}} to Queenscliff, {{is an important}} feeding ground for waterbirds and migratory waders. The Mud Islands, off Sorrento, are an important breeding habitat for white-faced storm petrels, silver gulls, Australian pelicans and Pacific gulls. Salt marshes in the northwestern sections of the bay, such as that in the Werribee <b>Sewage</b> <b>Farm</b> and the adjacent Spit Nature Conservation Reserve, are within the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula Ramsar Site, listed as wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention, and the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot is found at three wintering sites with saltmarsh habitat around Port Phillip and the Bellarine Peninsula. A variety of seabirds, such as Australasian gannets, nest on artificial structures in the bay.|$|E
500|$|By the 1930s, {{extensive}} use of the water closet meant {{that the amount of}} night soil being delivered to Carrington Moss had dropped significantly. [...] During this period, the majority of refuse placed on the Moss came from ash bins, although some was from slaughterhouses and lairage facilities. [...] In 1923, manure of only moderate value was being delivered, supplemented by sulphate of potash, sulphate of ammonia, and super-phosphates. [...] Altrincham <b>Sewage</b> <b>Farm</b> (visible on the above map) was used to flood the surrounding fields with sewage water. [...] To the west, a series of disused marl-pits formed Timperley Sewage Beds, a further source of manure.|$|E

500|$|Pentland enlisted as {{a private}} in the AIF on 5March 1915, sailing for Egypt with the 12th Light Horse Regiment aboard HMAT A29 Suevic on 13June. In August, his unit {{deployed}} to Gallipoli, where he fought as a machine gunner before being hospitalised the following month, suffering from typhoid fever; he was evacuated to England in December. Determined to leave the trenches behind after recovering, he volunteered for the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and was discharged from the AIF on 21February 1916 to take up his commission as a temporary second lieutenant in the RFC. His first solo flight in a Maurice Farman Longhorn at Brooklands, after two hours of dual instruction, ended with him overshooting the runway and crashing in a <b>sewage</b> <b>farm,</b> but he was unhurt and immediately undertook a second solo attempt, landing successfully. It was at Brooklands that he was first nicknamed [...] "Jerry". After completing pilot training, he was posted to France in June, flying B.E.2s with No.16 Squadron. Though the slow and vulnerable B.E.2 was considered [...] "Fokker fodder" [...] by its crews, Pentland and his observer quickly managed to score the former's first aerial victory, bringing down a German Eindecker over Habourdin on 9June. He was then posted to No.29 Squadron and was converting to DH.2 [...] "pusher" [...] fighters when he broke his leg playing rugby. After recovering, he instructed at London Colney until June 1917, when he joined No.19 Squadron, flying SPAD S.VIIs. This would become Pentland's favourite type due to its strength and manoeuvrability, {{even though it had}} to be 'flown' constantly and was unforgiving at low speed.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the successes}} seen in various {{northern}} towns, about 7,000 pail closets {{were introduced in}} 1871 in Leicester, where the implementation of water closets had been hindered by the refusal of the water company to provide adequate supplies. [...] The use of pail closets reduced the demand placed upon the area's inadequate sewerage system, but the town suffered with difficulties in the collection and treatment of the night soil. [...] Initially, night soil was collected by contractors, but after 1873 the local authority became responsible. [...] The authority found dealing with the night soil an expensive and difficult business and, following legal proceedings against the corporation in 1878, transport of night soil was transferred from the railway system to canal barges. [...] This, however, led to complaints that the canal was being polluted. [...] In 1886, the authority found that the River Soar was badly polluted by sewage and so they built a <b>sewage</b> <b>farm</b> at Beaumont Leys. [...] By {{the end of the}} 19th century, this and {{the construction of a new}} sewer system enabled all pail closets to be phased out and replaced by water closets. [...] In Manchester, faced with phenomenal population growth, the council attempted to retain the pail closet system, but following the exposure of the dumping of [...] of human faeces into the Medlock and Irwell rivers at their Holt Town sewage works, the council was forced to change their plans. [...] Originally they had intended to build incinerators, but public objections to the dumping of waste into rivers forced the council instead to purchase Carrington Moss in 1886, and Chat Moss in 1895, which were both developed as refuse disposal sites. [...] But by the 1930s neither site was still receiving night soil, the water closet having replaced dry conservancy in Manchester.|$|E
2500|$|.....in all {{probability}} the true way of purifying sewage...will be first {{to separate the}} sludge, and then turn into neutral effluent... retain it for a sufficient period, during which time it should be fully aerated, and finally discharge it into the stream in a purified condition.

50|$|<b>Sewage</b> <b>farms</b> are {{similarly}} used {{to dispose of}} wastewater {{through a series of}} ditches and lagoons (often with little or no pre-treatment). These are more often found in arid countries as the waterflow on the surface allows for irrigation (and fertilization) of agricultural land.|$|R
2500|$|Sir Edward Frankland {{conducted}} experiments at the <b>Sewage</b> <b>Farm</b> in Croydon, England, {{during the}} 1870s {{and was able}} to demonstrate that filtration of sewage through porous gravel produced a nitrified effluent (the ammonia was converted into nitrate) and that the filter remained unclogged over long periods of time. This established the then revolutionary possibility of biological treatment of sewage using a contact bed to oxidize the waste. This concept was taken up by the chief chemist for the London Metropolitan Board of Works, William Libdin, in 1887: ...|$|E
2500|$|The company built {{a company}} town, Pullman, Illinois on , [...] south of Chicago in 1880. Pullman {{contracted}} Solon Spenser Beman and Nathan F. Barrett {{to design and}} landscape the entire company town respectively. Both Beman and Barrett were experts in their respective fields. Beman interned under the famous architect Richard Upjohn and Barrett landscaped areas in Staten Island and Tuxedo, New York, as well as Long Branch, New Jersey. The community was designed by Solon Spencer Beman and landscaped by Nathan Barrett. According to George Pullman's governing conception, it was not within the city limits of Chicago but in the adjoining town of Hyde Park. On April 24, 1880, groundwork began on the company town. Throughout {{the construction of the}} company town Pullman strove to minimize costs and maximize construction efficiency. Whenever and wherever possible Pullman adopted techniques of mass production. The first departments and shops constructed were ones such as painting, iron, and woodworking, which could be used in the continuing construction of the company town. By January 1, 1881, the company town was ready for its first resident to move in. A foreman from the Pullman Companyâ€™s Detroit shop, Lee Benson, moved his wife, child, and sister into the company town. On the exterior, the buildings of the company town were made of red brick with limestone trim. On the interior, the buildings had high ceilings and large windows. The walls of the interior of the buildings were also purposefully painted in light colors to provide the semblance of a cheerful environment. By the time construction was finished on the company town it was composed of a library, theater, hotel, church, market, <b>sewage</b> <b>farm,</b> park, and residential buildings. The bar in the Florence Hotel was the only place where alcohol could be served and consumed in the company town. In the residential section of the town, there was 150 acres dedicated to tenements, flats and single-family homes that rented from $0.50 to $0.75 a month. The residences featured modern conveniences such as gas, water, indoor sewage plumbing and regular garbage removal. By 1884, the town included more than 1,400 tenements and flats, and by July of the following year, its population was over 8,600.|$|E
