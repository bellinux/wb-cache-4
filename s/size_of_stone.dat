40|$|Influence of {{the grain}} size of diamond stone on the {{superfinishing}} performances is investigated experimentally. The mechanism of chip formation is investigated by observing {{the shape of}} chips and the finished surfaces of workpiece with scanning electron microscope. The work materials used are alumina (Al 2 O 3), silicon carbide (SiC), silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) and zirconia (ZrO 2), which are sintered under the atmospheric pressure, and Mn-Zn ferrite, which is sintered under HIP. The grain <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> is changed from # 500 to # 8 000. The results are as follows. The diamond stone with suitable bonding strength {{makes it possible to}} remove the work material as chips even if its grain size is finer than # 1 000. Two types of chips are obserbed; one is the crack-type chips which are made by brittle fracture, and the other is the flow-type chips which are made by plastic deformation. As the grain <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> becomes smaller, the shape of chips changes from crack-type to flow-type. The critical grain size is dependent on the work materials and it becomes smaller in the order of ZrO 2, Mn-Zn ferrite, Al 2 O 3, Si 3 N 4 and SiC. The condition of making the flow-type chips is important to obtain the mirror surface of ceramics...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective : {{to verify}} the {{association}} of success rate of percutaneous lithotripsy, Guy score and <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stone.</b> Methods: one hundred patients submitted to percutaneous nephrolithotripsy were evaluated. All stones were classified according to Guy Score. Patient free <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> was considered when residual fragments were ≤ 2 mm. Results: according to guy Score, 54 % were score 1 (Group 1), 18 % score 2 (Group 2), 15 % score 3 (Group 3), and 13 % score 4 (Group 4). Success was observed in 77. 77 % in Group 1, 27. 77 % in group 2, 26. 6 % in Group 3, and 7. 69 % in Group 4.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether the distance from skin to stone, as measured by computed tomography (CT) scans, could affect the stone-free rate achieved via {{extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy}} (ESWL) in renal stone patients. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records 573 patients who had undergone ESWL at our institution between January 2006 and January 2010 for urinary stones sized from about 5 mm to 20 mm and who had no evidence of stone movement. We excluded patients with ureteral catheters and percutaneous nephrostomy patients; ultimately, only 43 patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria. We classified the success group as those patients whose stones had disappeared on a CT scan or simple X-ray within 6 weeks after ESWL and the failure group as those patients in whom residual stone fragments remained on a CT scan or simple X-ray after 6 weeks. We analyzed {{the differences between the two}} groups in age, sex, <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone,</b> skin-to-stone distance (SSD), stone location, density (Hounsfield unit: HU), voltage (kV), and the number of shocks delivered. Results: The success group included 33 patients and the failure group included 10. In the univariate and multivariate analysis, age, sex, <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone,</b> stone location, HU, kV and the number of shocks delivered did not differ significantly between the two groups. Only SSD was a factor influencing success: the success group clearly had a shorter SSD (78. 25 ± 12. 15 mm) than did the failure group (92. 03 ± 14. 51 mm). The results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed SSD to be the only significant independent predictor of the ESWL stone-free rate. Conclusions: SSD can be readily measured by CT scan; the ESWL stone-free rate was inversely proportional to SSD in renal stone patients. SSD may therefore be a useful clinical predictive factor of the success of ESWL on renal stones...|$|E

This study aimed {{to assess the}} relationship between urinary reflux and other reason <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> formation in children. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out with 199 children diagnosed with nephrolithiasis using ultrasonography. They were hospitalized in a referral children hospital in an urban area of in Iran. This study was conducted between 2014 and 2016. The presence of urinary reflux was assessed and graded by using the voiding cystourthrography modality. Results: Overall, 83. 9 % of the children had normal conditions regarding urinary reflux, while 1. 5 % had reflux grade I, 5. 5 % reflux grade II, 8. 1 % reflux grade III, and 1 % reflux grade IV with the total urinary reflux rate of 16. 1 %. The most prevalent observed clinical manifestation was irritability (45. 2 %) followed by fever (45. 2 %), and dysuria (19. 6 %). Also, no relationship was reported between the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> in both kidneys {{and the presence of}} reflux and its reflux. Furthermore, the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> in left and right kidneys was not related to hematuria, pyuria, and urinary tract infection. Conclusion: Vesicoureteral reflux and kidney stones in children may have interdependent identities. Therefore, the presence of reflux may not be a decisive reason for the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{time-dependent}} stochastic {{degradation of}} {{three types of}} claddings is analysed. For this purpose, 203 fac¸ades with stone claddings(directly adhered to the substrate), 195 with adhered ceramic claddings and 220 with painted surfaces were analysed.

Based on the data gathered, Markov chains are used to predict the degradation of claddings and to understand, in some detail, how {{the characteristics of the}} claddings contribute to the overall degradation. The results show that the distance from the sea and exposure to damp are significant to the degradation of all types of cladding. The type and <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> plates also influence the degradation of stone claddings. The exposure to wind-rain action has a high impact on the degradation of ceramic claddings.

40|$|Context: Spontaneous forniceal rupture {{is one of}} the {{possible}} complications of urolithiasis. The mechanism of forniceal rupture is not well explained in the literature. Most of the cases presented with sudden onset of acute renal colic and diagnosed by noncontrast CT (NCCT). Until now there is no solid consensus about the ideal management of such a condition. Aim: To study indications and validity of conservative management of spontaneous caliceal rupture. Settings and Design: This is an observational prospective study. Materials and Methods: All cases diagnosed as spontaneous forniceal rupture in our departments from 2011 to 2015 were enrolled. All cases were diagnosed with NCCT or CT-Urography [...] Non complicated patients were primarily managed conservatively. Intervention (DJ stent insertion, nephrostomy tube insertion, or urgent ureteroscopy) was reserved to complicated cases or solitary kidney. Drainage of urinoma was done in cases with sizable urinoma (more than 100 ml 3). Results: A total of 40 patients: Twenty eight (70 %) patients had normal serum creatinine level at presentation, while 12 (30 %) patients had elevated serum creatinine. Twenty three (57. 5 %) patients were successfully managed conservatively, their mean <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> was 6. 2 ± 2 mm and the hospital stay was 3. 1 ± 1. 9 days.

Statistical Analysis Used: Mann-Whitney test was used for testing difference between means because the data groups are not parametric. Otherwise, simple descriptive statestics were used. Conclusion: Spontaneous forniceal rupture is more likely to occur with smaller distal ureteric stones. Conservative management is a valid option in non-complicated cases.
