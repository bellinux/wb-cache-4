25|$|A {{minority}} of flash drives support biometric fingerprinting {{to confirm the}} user's identity. As of mid-, this was an expensive alternative to standard password protection offered on many new USB flash storage devices. Most fingerprint scanning drives rely upon the host operating system to validate the fingerprint via a <b>software</b> <b>driver,</b> often restricting the drive to Microsoft Windows computers. However, there are USB drives with fingerprint scanners which use controllers that allow access to protected data without any authentication.|$|E

50|$|On {{arriving}} in the U.S.A. in 1979, Johnson-Laird wrote the <b>software</b> <b>drivers</b> to permit the CP/M Operating System to run on an Onyx computer—this was the first commercial CP/M microcomputer with a hard disk and a data cartridge tape drive.|$|R
5000|$|An ISO can be [...] "mounted" [...] with {{suitable}} <b>driver</b> <b>software,</b> i.e. {{treated by}} the operating system {{as if it were}} a physical optical disc. Most Unix-based operating systems, including Linux and macOS, have built-in capability to mount an ISO. Versions of Windows after and including Windows 8 also have such capability. For other operating systems <b>software</b> <b>drivers</b> can be installed to achieve the same objective.|$|R
5000|$|Lower sample rates (such as 44.1 kHz) are {{implemented}} using a handshake protocol between the controller and codec which skips data during certain frames. (This capability {{depends on the}} codec. Alternatively, sample rate conversion could be performed in the DC97 (controller) or in the <b>software</b> <b>driver.)</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|Dvorak {{encoding}} is {{an unavoidable}} consequence of typing on a non-Dvorak keyboard using the Dvorak layout, for instance when using a <b>software</b> <b>driver</b> {{to compensate for}} the lack of rerouting of signals in the keyboard. This is the most common practice because it doesn't require a purchase of a special Dvorak keyboard.|$|E
50|$|One popular {{exception}} to the disuse of the REUs was GEOS. As GEOS made heavy use of a primitive, software-controlled form of swap space, it tended to be slow when used exclusively with floppy disks or hard drives. With the addition of an REU, along with a small <b>software</b> <b>driver,</b> GEOS would use the expanded memory in place of its usual swap space, increasing GEOS' operating speed.|$|E

50|$|The AudioPCI {{supported}} DOS {{games and}} applications using a <b>software</b> <b>driver</b> that would install during DOS, or the real-mode, boot-time portion of Windows 9x. This driver virtualized a Sound Blaster-compatible ISA sound card {{through the use}} of the PC's NMI and a TSR program. This allowed the AudioPCI to have more compatible out-of-the-box DOS support than some of its PCI competitors for the time.|$|E
50|$|The Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector {{includes}} a USB extension cable, a manual, and a software CD. It {{is recommended that}} {{the latest version of}} the Wi-Fi USB Connector software should be downloaded and installed rather than using the version on the CD, as important updates {{have been made in the}} newer versions.

50|$|As {{with many}} MFP manufacturers, {{some of the}} market {{segments}} are not produced directly by the manufacturer. In Konica Minolta's case, many smaller SOHO MFP products (such as the bizhub 130f, wearing Minebea marks in hardware and in <b>software</b> <b>drivers)</b> are produced by third parties. By the same token, many other companies also re-badge Konica Minolta products under OEM agreements.|$|R
