5|$|Logging {{settlements}} {{were established}} {{on the northern}} shore of Lake Washington in the 1860s and 1870s, relying primarily on the water for intercity transportation. The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway was built along the lakefront in 1888, connecting <b>Seattle</b> <b>to</b> the new towns of Bothell and Kenmore. By the 1890s, unpaved logging trails had been completed along Lake Washington and the railroad, reaching as far northeast as Maltby.|$|E
5|$|An unpaved {{extension}} of the Bothell Road, traveling along the Sammamish River to Woodinville, Redmond, and Fall City, was designated as {{a branch of the}} Sunset Highway (State Road 2) in 1925.
