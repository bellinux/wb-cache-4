40|$|Testosterone {{controls}} {{the synthesis of}} <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> <b>protein</b> F in male rats by regulating the cellular concentration of its mRNA (mRNAF). Phage lambda recombinants have been isolated containing the complete F gene. In addition plasmids have been constructed containing cDNAF sequences {{some of which are}} probably full-length (approximately 700 bp). Detailed restriction mapping shows that the F gene is 1. 7 kbp long and contains approximately 1. 0 kbp of intervening sequence arranged in at least two introns (420 bp and 600 bp). Part of cDNAF has been sequenced showing that the terminal 125 bp of the 3 ' untranslated region of mRNAF has substantial (greater than 70 %) sequence homology with the 3 ' end of the mRNA coding for another androgen-dependent <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> <b>protein</b> (protein S). The cloned F gene has been detected in liver and seminal vesicle DNA along with an homologous but structurally different gene. The hormonal control of mRNAF was examined with cDNAF.

40|$|Rat <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> <b>protein</b> 4 (RSV 4) is {{a member}} of the <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> <b>protein</b> family present in rats, 90 {{residues}} long. When secreted, it is involved in many functions related to the reproduction ranging from semen coagulation to sperm capacitation, but its fragments have also shown in vitro pharmacological properties such as anti-inflammatory and pro-coagulant activity, important in the cancer development. However, no three-dimensional model of this protein is yet available probably because of the presence of intrinsic disorder in the structure. In this article we report structural studies in solution of RSV 4 by SEC (size exclusion chromatography) and CD (circular dichroism). In solution the monomer is highly flexible and poorly organized with the presence of highly fluctuating helical segments and, as also suggested by SEC, is classifiable as NU-PMG (natively unfolded pre-molten globule). The lack of a cooperative sigmoidal structural transition induced by thermal and GdmCl perturbation in monomer supports the poor structural organization expected for a NU-PMG conformational model. The structure of RSV 4 monomer was modeled computationally and subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to study its conformational changes and energetic stabilit...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{recently}} demonstrated in liquefied human seminal plasma {{the presence of}} the novel kallikrein hK 2 in association with protein C inhibitor (PCI) as a 75 -kDa complex. In the present study, we showed that hK 2, immediately after ejaculation, was recovered only in its free form but complex formation with PCI occurred rapidly thereafter and was completed within 10 minutes. That reaction required an enzymatically active kallikrein. In order to determine the patterns of hydrolysis of major <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> <b>proteins,</b> semenogelins and fibronectin were exposed to hK 2 and to hK 3 (prostate-specific antigen or PSA) and cleavage sequences were identified by N-terminal sequencing. Free hK 2 was able to hydrolyze semenogelins and fibronectin in vitro. Most of cleavage sites were at the carboxyl-side of arginyl residues. Semeno 9 elins were hydrolyzed to a similar extent by catalytic (and similar) concentration of either hK 2 or PSA though no common cleavage sites was identified for both proteinases. Unlike semenogelins, fibronectin was hydrolyzed much more efficiently by hK 2 than by PSA. These results show that hK 2 is enzymatically active during {{a short period of time}} after ejaculation, that major <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> <b>proteins</b> can be the target of this proteolytic activity, and that hK 2 and PSA have different substrate specificities...|$|R

The structural protein of human seminal coagulum, the predominant protein in seminal vesicle secretion, was rapidly cleaved by the prostatic enzyme, which suggests that this <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> <b>protein</b> may serve as the physiological substrate for the protease. The prostatic enzyme hydrolyzed arginine- and lysine-containing substrates with a distinct preference for the former. All synthetic substrates tested were poor substrates for the enzyme. Synthetic Factor XIa substrate (pyro-glutamyl-prolyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide), and the synthetic kallikrein substrate (H-D-prolyl-phenylalanyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide) were hydrolyzed with maximum specific activities at 23 degrees C of 79 and 34 nmol/min per mg and Km values of 1. 0 and 0. 45 mM, respectively.

Mice deficient in {{the expression of the}} autoimmune regulator (Aire) gene, which are defective in thymic expression of self antigens and central tolerance, develop spontaneous prostatitis. In this study, we found that Aire-deficient mice developed spontaneous B and T cell immune responses to a prostate autoantigen, seminal vesicle secretory protein 2 (SVS 2), which we believe to be novel. We show that thymic expression of this self antigen was Aire dependent. Moreover, prostatitis was induced in WT mice through immunization with SVS 2, demonstrating that immunity to SVS 2 was sufficient to induce prostatitis. The clinical relevance of this antigen was highlighted by our observation that patients with chronic prostatitis possessed specific autoantibodies against the human SVS 2 -like <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> <b>protein</b> semenogelin.

40|$|SV-IV (<b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> <b>protein</b> no. 4) is {{a potent}} {{immunomodulatory}} and anti-inflammatory secretory protein (Mr 9758) produced in large amounts by the rat seminal vesicle epithelium. Here we show that this protein possesses the ability to upregulate in J 774 macrophages {{the expression of the}} gene coding for the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The increase in NO production consequent on the marked enhancement of iNOS activity was not associated with apoptotic damage of the SV-IV-treated cells. In the same experimental model, however, LPS induced upregulation of iNOS coupled with an increase in NO production and marked apoptotic death. Differences in the ability of SV-IV and LPS to control the life/death signal balance in target cells via trans-membrane activation of apoptotic (mediated by TNF-alpha and NO/iNOS system) and anti-apoptotic (mediated by bcl- 2, c-myc, etc.) pathways are suggested to be the basis of the apoptotic fate of the experimentally treated cells. In addition, considering the important role played by NO in the process of mammalian reproduction, SV-IV may be involved in the fine tuning of NO concentration in the female genital tract mucosa via an SV-IV-mediated control of iNOS gene expression in local macrophages...|$|E

In this work we report experimental data which demonstrate that the 1 - 16 peptide (P 1 - 16) possesses a marked effect on the AT activity by preventing the formation of the thrombin-AT complex. We found that the formation of thrombin-AT complex is markedly decreased in the presence of P 1 - 16 used at equimolar concentration with thrombin as evaluated with SDS-PAGE. We also monitored the conformational changes of thrombin in the presence of different P 1 - 16 concentrations, and calculated the Kd of thrombin/P 1 - 16 system by circular dichroism technique.

40|$|Serum {{deprivation}} induced {{in human}} lymphoblastoid Raji cells oxidative stress-associated apoptotic death and G 0 /G 1 cell cycle arrest. Addition into culture medium of the immunomodulatory protein <b>Seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> <b>protein</b> 4 (SV-IV) protected these cells against apoptosis but not against cycle arrest. The antiapoptotic activity was related to: (1) decrease of endocellular reactive Oxygen species (ROS) (2) increase of mRNAs encoding anti-oxidant enzymes (catalase, G 6 PD) and antiapoptotic proteins (survivin, cox- 1, Hsp 70, c-Fos); (3) decrease of mRNAs encoding proapoptotic proteins (c-myc, Bax, caspase- 3, Apaf- 1). The biochemical changes underlaying these effects were probably induced by a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity {{triggered by the}} binding of SV-IV to its putative plasma membrane receptors. The ineffectiveness of SV-IV to abrogate the cycle arrest was accounted for by its downregulating effects on D 1, 3 /E G 1 -cyclins and CdK 2 / 4 gene expression, ppRb/pRb ratio, and intracellular ROS concentration. In conclusion, these experiments: (1) prove that SV-IV acts as a cell survival factor; (2) suggest the involvement of a PTK in SV-IV signaling; (3) point to cell cycle-linked enzyme inhibition as responsible for cycle arrest; (4) provide a model to dissect the cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal; (5) imply a possible role of SV-IV in the survival of hemiallogenic implanting embryos...|$|E

In particular, this protein was shown to possess the ability to markedly inhibit in vivo the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses of mice to nonbacterial cellular antigens (sheep erythrocytes and spermatozoa). We report data that demonstrate that in mice treated with SV-IV and infected with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, SV-IV is able to downregulate some important immunological and biochemical parameters that serovar Typhimurium normally upregulates in these animals.

The mechanism underlying these phenomena was investigated, and the strong immunosuppression produced by SV-IV in serovar Typhimurium-infected mice was suggested to be the basis for the increased rate of mortality. The SV-IV-mediated immunosuppression was characterized by a decrease in the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, altered lymphocyte-macrophage interaction, downregulation of cytokine and inducible nitric oxide synthase gene expression, inhibition of macrophage phagocytosis and intracellular killing activities, and absence of apoptosis in the splenocyte population o...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> <b>protein</b> number 4 (SV-IV) is a small, basic, multifunctional, {{intrinsically}} disordered secretory protein synthesized {{in large}} amounts by rat seminal vesicle epithelium under androgen transcriptional control. SV-IV-immunorelated proteins occur in other rat tissues and in humans. METHODS: The in vitro effect of SV-IV on human FcepsilonRI+ cells was investigated by standard immunologic, biochemical and molecular biology procedures. RESULTS: SV-IV-induced histamine release from human basophils and lung mast cells without any influence on leukotriene C(4) release and cell migration. The histamine release rate was slower {{compared with that}} induced by anti-IgE, the temperature dependence of the event being similar. SV-IV-induced histamine release was Ca 2 +-dependent, suggesting a physiological interaction of the protein with FcepsilonRI+ cells. SV-IV and anti-IgE acted synergistically on the histamine release. SV-IV did not induce de novo synthesis of cytokines and growth factors (transforming growth factor-beta(1), interleukin- 10, interleukin- 13, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor A) in FcεRI+ cells. CONCLUSIONS: SV-IV protein induces in human FcεRI+ cells the release of histamine, a proinflammatory, antiapoptotic and immunosuppressive biogenic amine. These data: (1) {{are consistent with the}} antiapoptotic and immunosuppressive properties of SV-IV; (2) confirm a regulatory feature of SV-IV on mammal inflammatory reactivity by either inhibiting the arachidonate cascade pathway or stimulating proinflammatory cytokine release from lymphocyte/monocytes and histamine from FcεRI+ cells; (3) raise the possibility of a protective role of SV-IV on implanting hemiallogenic blastocysts against maternal reactive oxygen species and immunological attacks at the uterine implantation site...|$|E
40|$|The <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> <b>protein</b> No. 4 (SV-IV) {{secreted}} {{from the}} rat seminal vesicle epithelium, possesses immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties {{and it is}} a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation both in vivo and in vitro. This research aimed to investigate the possible effect of SV-TV on the process of human blood coagulation. Preliminary experiments showed that the recalcification time (RT) of platelet-poor plasma (PPP) samples, obtained from both normal subjects and patients affected by some hemorrhagic disorders, was found to be markedly reduced in the presence of micromolar amounts of SV-IV. It was demonstrated that the concentration of free antithrombin III (AT III) occurring in blood sera obtained from PPP samples recalcified in the presence of SV-IV was significantly decreased in comparison with sera obtained from PPP recalcified in the absence of SV-IV. It was also shown that PPP treatment with SV-IV significantly reduced the concentration of free AT III without affecting the levels of other plasma serine protease inhibitors, such as alpha(2) -macroglobulin, alpha(1) -antitrypsin and C- 1 -inhibitor. In addition, the RT of PPP treated with a specific rabbit anti-AT III polyclonal antiserum (anti-AT III treated PPP) was not modified by SV-IV. These findings were confirmed by the observation that the addition of SV-IV into an in vitro coagulation system, containing pure fibrinogen, alpha-thrombin and AT-III, resulted in complete suppression of thrombin inhibition by AT III. No other steps of the blood clotting process (prothrombinase complex, factor XIII, fibrinogen concentration) were affected by SV-IV...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} was to describe the profile of membrane proteins from sperm of tropically adapted Morada Nova rams (N = 5). Samples from protein-enriched fractions of ejaculated sperm (containing 400 μg of protein) were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and respective maps analyzed using PDQuest software (version 7. 3. 0; Bio-Rad). Proteins were identified using tandem mass spectrometry. Also, membrane proteins were incubated with antibodies against binder of sperm protein (BSP) 1 and bodhesin 2 (Bdh- 2), components of vesicular gland secretion. For membrane proteins of ejaculated sperm, an average of 133 ± 4. 6 spots were detected per gel, of which, 107 spots were consistently present on all gels. Sixty-eight spots and 37 proteins were identified using mass spectrometry, corresponding to 71. 6 % of the intensity of all spots detected. Three major spots identified as ram <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> <b>protein</b> (RSVP) 14 represented approximately 30 % of the intensity of all spots. Two of the most intense spots in the gel reacted against anti-BSP 1, at 14 kDa. In addition, four low molecular weight spots reacted with anti-Bdh- 2 antibodies. Proteins RSVP and Bdh- 2 belong to the BSP and spermadhesin families, respectively, and were previously reported as major components of ram seminal proteins. Additional proteins identified in the sperm membrane two-dimensional maps included alpha- 2 -heparan sulfate-glycoprotein, plasma glutamate carboxypeptidase, arylsulfatase A, cathelicidin, heat shock protein 70 kDa, angiotensin-converting enzyme, leucine aminopeptidase, and clusterin. Some proteins were present as multiple isoforms, such as tubulin (12), alpha- 2 -heparan sulfate-glycoprotein (5), ATP synthase (5), Bdh- 2 (4) and RSVP 14 (3). Based on gene ontology analysis, the most common biological processes associated with the membrane proteins were cellular processes (34 %), response to stimulus (14 %), and metabolic processes (11 %). Binding (37 %) and catalytic activity (32 %) corresponded to the most frequent molecular functions for those proteins. In conclusion, we identified a diverse cohort of components of membrane proteins in ram sperm. Major proteins previously reported in seminal plasma, such as RSVP 14 and Bdh- 2, were also extracted from sperm membranes.

40|$|Male {{reproductive}} {{fitness is}} strongly affected by seminal fluid. In addition to {{interacting with the}} female environment, seminal fluid mediates important physiological characteristics of sperm, including capacitation and motility. In mammals, the male reproductive tract shows a striking degree of compartmentalization, with at least six distinct tissue types contributing material that is combined with sperm in an ejaculate. Although studies of whole ejaculates have been undertaken in some species, we lack a comprehensive picture of the specific proteins produced by different accessory tissues. Here, we perform proteomic investigations of six regions of the male reproductive tract in mice—seminal vesicles, anterior prostate, dorsolateral prostate, ventral prostate, bulbourethral gland, and bulbourethral diverticulum. We identify 766 proteins that could be mapped to 506 unique genes and compare them with a high-quality human seminal fluid data set. We find that Gene Ontology functions of seminal proteins are largely conserved between mice and humans. By placing these data in an evolutionary framework, we show that <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> <b>proteins</b> have experienced a significantly higher rate of nonsynonymous substitution compared with the genome, which could {{be the result of}} adaptive evolution.

Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization histochemistry indicated that the expression of caltrin II is restricted to luminal epithelial cells in the <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles.</b> Its message levels markedly decreased either following castration, which was restored by simultaneous administration of testosterone, or after treatment of the animals with estradiol, suggesting that the expression of caltrin II is androgen-dependent. Recombinant caltrin II had an elastase inhibitor activity. Comparison of sequence between the caltrin II and related genes and their molecular evolutionary analyses revealed that caltrin II and <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> secretory <b>proteins</b> (SVPs) appear to be evolved from a common ancestor gene that is made by fusion of semenogelin an...|$|R
40|$|The {{abundant}} {{class of}} poly(A+) RNA [poly(A+) RNA 11 S] from rat <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> {{was used to}} synthesize ds-cDNA 11 S. The ds-cDNA 11 S was inserted and cloned into the Pst I site of pBR- 322 using E. coli RR 1 as host. Colony filter hybridization and restriction mapping was used to demonstrate that a 620 NTP long insert in a plasmid clone (pSV 2) represents the almost full length structural gene coding for a precursor to the <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> secretion <b>protein</b> IV (SVS IV). The entire insert was sequenced and the coding region was matched with the known amino acid sequence. Most of the signal peptide sequence {{was derived from the}} DNA sequence. The insert in pSV 2 was labelled and used to study the effect of testosterone on the accumulation of mRNA SVS IV. Administration of testosterone to castrated rats resulted in the induction of mRNA SVS IV from a few molecules per cell to levels of over 100, 000 after 96 h of hormone treatment...|$|R
40|$|The major <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> {{secreted}} <b>proteins</b> {{in human}} semen, semenogelin I and semenogelin II, interact non-covalently and via disulphide bridges to instantly form a coagulum upon ejaculation. The coagulum is liquefied {{after a few}} minutes due to the action of a prostatic serine protease, prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In contrast to rat semen, which forms an insoluble plug within minutes of expulsion, no transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking has been demonstrated in ejaculated human semen. However, we here show that semenogelin I and semenogelin II, both in <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> fluid and purified from semen, are substrates for factor XIIIa, the fibrin cross-linking transglutaminase. The cross-linking of the semenogelins, which was conformation-dependent, and the incorporation of a fluorescence-labelled amine, were visualised by SDS/PAGE and Western blot. Purified semenogelin I and semenogelin II could be cross-linked separately into complexes. Moreover, digestion of semenogelin with PSA produced fragments, some of which were cross-linked into complexes by factor XIIIa. We also found that PSA was unable to release any semenogelin fragments during exposure of the high molecular-mass complexes of cross-linked semenogelin to active PSA...|$|R
40|$|The entire {{coding region}} for rat <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> {{secretory}} <b>protein</b> IV was obtained on a 3. 5 kb Eco RI fragment isolated from a genomic library in lambda Charon 4 A. The coding sequence for SVS IV message is interrupted twice by introns. The first lies just downstream from the juncture of the 21 amino acid secretory signal peptide with {{the start of}} the mature protein, and the second lies in the 3 '-nontranslated region. The major transcriptional start site was mapped by primer extention and is 22 nucleotides upstream from the translational initiation codon. S 1 protection experiments indicated additional minor transcriptional starts about 27 and 50 nucleotides further upstream from the major cap site. The entire transcriptional unit comprises about 1740 nucleotides. The SVS IV gene does not belong to an obvious gene family, and it is conserved in mice and guinea pigs...|$|R
40|$|Primary cell {{cultures}} {{were established}} from explants of rat <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle.</b> The establishment of primary cell cultures required, among other factors, {{the presence of}} testosterone. Two cell populations were detected in such primary cultures: fibroblast-like cells and epithelial-like cells; the latter encompassed a subtype of small cells and a subtype of large squamous cells (most likely {{the result of a}} degenerative process acting upon the former). Histochemical, as well as electron-microscopical observations, indicated the presence of a persistent secretory activity in the small epithelial cells; fibroblast and large squamous epithelial cells were inactive in this respect. Staining of the cells with a peroxidase-conjugated antibody and analysis of the proteins produced in the presence of labelled methionine, showed that one of the major rat <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> secretory <b>proteins,</b> namely RSV-IV, was also produced. Conditions which favoured the growth of epithelial cells, rather than of fibroblasts, were determined. The use of nearly homogeneous cell populations and the use of collagen-coated Petri dishes, allowed the cloning of two independently obtained permanent cell lines, namely SVC- 1 and SVC- 2. The in vitro growth rate of both cell lines was modulated by the amount of testosterone in the medium. Both cell lines were able to synthesize a significant amount of RSV-IV protein under testosterone control...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecently, {{comprehensive}} {{studies were}} conducted regarding the reproductive development, age at puberty, spermatogenesis and the protein {{profile in the}} seminal plasma of Santa Ines rams. Despite the abundant information obtained from these studies regarding these tropically adapted rams in Brazil, it is still unclear how sperm parameters relate to the expression of molecular components of the reproductive tract. In this regard, {{the present study was}} conducted to determine if sperm parameters were empirically associated with the seminal plasma proteins described in two-dimensional electrophoresis maps. Seminal plasma proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and the respective maps electronically analyzed. Protein spots associated with higher or lower sperm motility were then identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Based on sperm motility, the ejaculates were divided into two groups: those containing up to 80 % motile cells (G 1; n= 11) and those with more than 80 % motile sperm (G 2; n= 10). On average, 236 spots per gel were detected. Eleven spots were significantly more intense in gels from animals with ejaculates characterized by higher semen motility scores (G 2). The intensity of three other spots was higher in gels from the G 1 group. All spots differentially expressed for G 1 and G 2, were present in at least 90 % of the gels. From the 13 spots differentially expressed in G 1 and G 2, four spots were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Spots expressed with more intensity in the ejaculates with higher sperm motility (G 2) were identified as arylsulfatase A and zinc-alpha- 2 -glycoprotein. On the other hand, two spots associated with G 1 were identified as ram <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles</b> <b>protein</b> 22 kDa (RSVP- 22) and bodhesin- 2. Knowledge of these identities represents a crucial step toward the comprehension of how specific seminal plasma proteins are related to sperm motility...|$|R
40|$|The heterodimeric sperm-coating protein CFS was {{previously}} localised on the middle-piece region of rat spermatozoa by anti-CFS rabbit antibodies. CFS-immunorelated antigens were {{detected in the}} secretion of the water buffalo <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> by <b>protein</b> electrophoresis and Western blotting. Spermatozoa from buffalo epididymal cauda were incubated with the rat antigen and, upon immunostaining with anti-CFS antibodies and goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -conjugated IgGs, CFS was found attached on both the post-acrosomal region and the tail. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis permitted the localisation of CFS-related antigens on the same domains of buffalo ejaculated spermatozoa. These {{results suggest that the}} buffalo antigens not only share some epitopes with the homologous rat antigen but may also have some of its functional properties. Ejaculated spermatozoa were capacitated in vitro and then assayed for their content of CFS-like antigens. An inverse relationship was found between the levels of capacitation and the amounts of antigens detected, thus suggesting that the in vitro treatment was effective at removing CFS-related proteins from the cell surface. Titration of these proteins to monitor plasma membrane changes during sperm manipulation or to evaluate sperm quality is proposed...|$|R
