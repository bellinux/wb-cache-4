The effluent of the reactors turned yellow after dosing nitrite and feed. It was additionally found that nitrite at relatively high concentrations can react with amino acids to form a yellow compound or compounds. The latter appeared to be more toxic than nitrite alone.

A 3 -CA metabolizing bacterium, Comamonas testosteroni strain 12, was mixed with molten agar and encapsulated in open ended silicon tubes.

The bioaugmentation activity of a reactor containing the immobilized cells was compared with a reactor with suspended I 2 gfp cells. From day 25 - 30 after inoculation, the reactor with only suspended cells failed to degrade 3 -CA completely, due to a decrease in specific metabolic activity. In the reactors with immobilized cells however, 3 -CA continued to be removed. A mass balance indicated that ca. 10 % of the degradation activity was due to the immobilized cells. Slow release of the growing embedded cells from the agar into the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> medium, resulting in a higher number of active 3 -CA degrading 12 cells, was responsible for ca. 90 % of the degradation.

The potential modes of transformation and removal of reactive dyes in treatment and in the environment are principally through anaerobic and aerobic biodegradation and photodegradation. The research herein describes the use of LC-MS analysis with laboratory simulations to develop {{a better understanding of the}} occurrence and fate of reactive dyes and their degradation products in the aquatic environment. One reason for the lack of information on the environmental fate of reactive dyes has been the paucity of robust analytical methods suitable for the determination of dyes in aqueous samples. Robust analytical methods were optimised to provide LC-MS and MSMS identification of degradation products. Additionally, interpretation of the MSMS spectra of known reactive dyes provided novel characteristic fragment ions indicative of the triazine reactive group of reactive dyes. Fibre reactive dyes are designed to have a degree of photostability and therefore their photodegradation behaviour has not been widely investigated. Little is known of their stability to daylight over prolonged periods of irradiation in dilute aqueous solutions and in the presence of humic substances. The kinetics of photodegradation of an anthraquinone dye (Reactive Blue H 4 R) and azo dye (Reactive Yellow P 5 G) were evaluated. The former underwent rapid and extensive degradation 01 / 2 1. 5 h). The major products formed were identified using LC-MSMS and a photodegradation pathway proposed. By comparison, the photodegradation of the azo dye was significantly slower, 01 / 2 30 h). The addition of humic substancesa ppearedt o have little effect on the rate of photodegradationu nder the conditions used. The reduction of azo dyes under anaerobic treatment has been extensively studied, but the subsequent fate of the initial reduction products when exposed to air are not understood. Three relatively simple azo dyes, Amaranth, Sunset Yellow and Naphthol Blue-Black, were reduced and their autoxidation products identified by LC-MS. These were subsequently used to predict the autoxidation products of a more complex azo reactive dye: Reactive Red 3. 1. Additionally, a persistent degradation product from the anaerobicaerobic treatment of Reactive Red 3. 1 was identified from LC-MS data. Azo reactive dyes are generally regarded as being resistant to aerobic degradation and there are few published data regarding degradation pathways for reactive anthraquinone dyes. Pure cultures of Pseudomonas docunhae, A 9046 and A texaco and mixed bacterial consortia (<b>semi-continuous</b> <b>activated</b> <b>sludge,</b> SCAS) aerobic degradation of azo and anthraquinone reactive dyes was studied. Two azo dyes were degraded by pure cultures of A docunhae and A 9046, suggesting that azo dyes can be aerobically degraded given favourable conditions.

Both mesophilic and thermophilic biomass did not flocculate with wastewater colloidal particles under anaerobic conditions.

These calculations, combined with the fact that bioflocculation actually did occur at 30 Â°C and the unlikelyness of the hydrophobic interaction, point in the direction of bacterial exo-polymers governing bridging flocculation.

Emphasis is placed on determining the relationship between the ultimate B. O. D satisfied by the system and the oxygen utilization. A second objective is to study the effects of the dissolved oxygen concentration and the B. O. D. loading rate on the oxygen utilization rate. This study was performed at the municipal sewage treatment plant for the City of Lincoln, Nebraska. The municipal sewage treatment plant is located at the northern edge of Lincoln. The plant is designed for primary and secondary treatment. The effluent is discharged into the Salt Creek. Salt Creek is a perennial stream that flows into the Platte River. The raw sewage entering the treatment plant passes through a bar screen before entering the wet well. The sewage is pumped from the wet well to a distribution box. A venturi tube placed in the pipe between the wet well and distribution box measures the influent flow. From the distribution box the sewage flows into aerated grit chambers which remove grit and provide pre-aeration. Following pre-aeration, the sewage flows to primary sedimentation tanks and then into the secondary treatment systems. Sludge disposal is by anaerobic digestion and vacuum filtration. Performance tests consist of dissolved oxygen measurements and determinations of the oxygen utilization rate at design loadings. The tests are conducted between 12 : 00 noon and 5 : 00 p. m. on three consecutive days between Monday and Friday. At the time of the lowest dissolved oxygen concentration for each day, a sample of mixed liquor is tested to determine the oxygen utilization rate in the aeration tank. The mixed liquor suspended solids concentration should be between 4000 and 5000 milligrams per liter. Based on the authorâ€™s interpretation of the performance requirements, the data indicates that the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> system <b>tested</b> does not meet the manufacturers specifications.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{membrane}} bioreactors (MBRs) {{have become a}} mature technology that can compete with conventional wastewater treatment processes. An MBR comprises an <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> bioreactor to biodegrade the polluting components and a membrane module which separates the biomass from the effluent by means of micro- or ultrafiltration. The latter replaces the sedimentation tanks of conventional <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> processes. While a reduced plant footprint and a better effluent quality, completely free of suspended solids, are among the many advantages, membrane fouling remains the major bottleneck. Despite extensive research efforts, membrane fouling in MBRs is still far from being fully understood, mainly due to the inherent interactions between the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge,</b> the influent and applied process conditions. Due {{to the lack of}} clear causal relationships between <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> mixed liquor characteristics and membrane fouling, in practice most, if not all, MBRs are operated {{in such a way that}} effects of membrane fouling are reduced. It is clear that the remediation of fouling increases the overall cost of an MBR and is, unfortunately, not always very effective. In order to be able to prevent membrane fouling, the focus in this dissertation has been on investigating the impact of the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> mixed liquor characteristics on membrane fouling in MBRs. From lab-scale, pilot-scale and full-scale MBRs experiments the following results are obtained. Better bioflocculation [...] . less foulingThe influence of <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> deflocculation and reflocculation was studied in a lab-scale MBR. <b>Activated</b> <b>sludge</b> could be deflocculated and reflocculated by changing the ratio of monovalent over polyvalent cations ([M/P]) in the influent. As a result of a high [M/P] in the influent, severe sludge deflocculation occurred and worsened filtration characteristics were observed. Increasing fragment surface as a consequence of <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> deflocculation coincided with a reduced <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> filterability. Once the influent was switched to a low [M/P], the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> reflocculated and filtration characteristics improved significantly within three weeks after the switch. With this experiment, it is evidenced that bioflocculation strongly influences membrane fouling in MBRs. Filtration characteristics deteriorate dramatically when <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> deflocculates whereas a reflocculated sludge improves the filtration performance significantly. Higher SRT [...] . better bioflocculation [...] . less foulingA pilot-scale MBR was operated at different solids retention times (SRT) to study the influence of SRT on effluent quality, bioflocculation and membrane fouling in MBRs. Effluent quality was proven to be unaffected at an SRT of 50 days and 30 days, while at an SRT of 10 days nitrification decreased from 99 % to 81 %. Also COD removal rates were slightly lower compared to SRTs of 30 days and 50 days. Apart from effluent quality, also <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> bioflocculation deteriorated at an SRT of 10 days. The deflocculation could be monitored by means of automated analysis of microscopic <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> images. An increasing relative fragment surface in the images, reflecting a more deflocculated state of the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge,</b> contributes to severe membrane fouling. Conclusively, a higher SRT induces a better bioflocculation which improves the filterability of the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> and reduces the membrane fouling. It is all about bioflocculation [...] . or not?Ten full-scale MBRs were sampled in both winter and summer. Each of these <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> samples was subjected to the Delft Filtration Characterization method (DFCm) to determine the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> filterability while a large set of parameters was measured. Although in literature most of these parameters have been indicated as major membrane foulants, no clear correlation between any single parameter and filterability could be established. This suggests that every parameter alone is a poor indicator of the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> fouling propensity. The results from this sampling campaign reveal that a combination of sludge morphology and relative hydrophobicity (RH) allows for a first classification of <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> filterability. It was found that <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> deflocculation and low <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> RH have a negative impact on <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> filterability and vice versa. For sludge samples that have poor to good <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> filterability, accurate estimations of sludge filterability can be calculated on the basis of floc-bound proteins (eEPS PN), soluble polysaccharides (SMP PS), sludge morphology, the dissociation constant and RH. Finally, the impact of the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> characteristics on membrane fouling was studied using a reverse engineering approach. A commercially available membrane performance enhancer (MPE 50, Nalco) was added to <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> samples originating from five different membrane bioreactors treating municipal or industrial wastewaters. Before and after the addition of MPE 50, a large set of <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> parameters was measured and filtration tests were performed in a lab-scale MBR. As a consequence of the MPE 50 addition, <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> bioflocculation improved and the concentration of SMP in the bulk liquid strongly reduced. Also the concentration of eEPS reduced, though to a lesser extent. For sludges with a low RH, the addition of MPE 50 increased the RH. These experiments confirm that a rough classification of <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> filterability can be made from RH and image analysis data alone. Based on <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> morphology, eEPS PN and RH, the <b>activated</b> <b>sludge</b> filterability can be accurately estimated for sludge samples with moderate to good filterability. nrpages: 197 status: publishe...|$|R
