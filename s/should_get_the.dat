They enter the office and find Teresa Mueller (Lisa Dempsey), the building's cleaning lady, dead, {{and some of the}} patient files scattered. Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) and Lieutenant Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford) suspect that one of Dr. Kroger's patients was responsible. Dr. Kroger says it can be Joseph Wheeler (Kevin Fry), who threatened him in the past. Dr. Kroger blames himself for not predicting the murder, and decides to retire. Wheeler, however, is dismissed as a suspect as he has a confirmed alibi.|$|E

25|$|At {{the feminist}} {{congress}} that began on 5 September 1900, chaired by Marguerite Durand, {{most of the}} delegates were from the elite rather than working women. Saumoneau and Renaud were admitted somewhat reluctantly. While the attendees had no difficulty supporting a resolution that called for an eight-hour day for industrial workers, with a full day off, they had considerable difficulty supporting a proposal that their own maids <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> same conditions. Saumoneau and Renaud pushed the point.|$|E
25|$|The Calydonian or Aetolian Nonetheless it was Atalanta {{who first}} succeeded in {{wounding}} the boar with an arrow, although Meleager finished it off, and offered the prize to Atalanta, who had drawn first blood. But {{the sons of}} Thestios, who considered it disgraceful that a woman <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> trophy where men were involved, took the skin from her, {{saying that it was}} properly theirs by right of birth, if Meleager chose not to accept it. Outraged by this, Meleager slew the sons of Thestios and again gave the skin to Atalanta (Bibliotheke). Meleager's mother, sister of Meleager's slain uncles, took the fatal brand from the chest where she had kept it (see Meleager) and threw it once more on the fire; as it was consumed, Meleager died on the spot, as the Fates had foretold. Thus Artemis achieved her revenge against King Oeneus.|$|E
25|$|After {{several days}} of counting, the Division of Elections showed Murkowski with a lead of some 1,700 votes over Miller, with about 8,000 {{write-in}} votes yet to be counted, and a trend of counting 97 percent of the write-ins as for Murkowski. Murkowski's campaign shied away from declaring a victory before the count was finished. As of November 17, (the {{last day of the}} hand count), the Division of Elections showed Murkowski having a lead of over 10,000 votes, meaning that even if all the 8,000 challenged ballots were discounted, Murkowski would still lead by about 2,200 votes. The Miller campaign then demanded a hand recount of the entire election, claiming that as Murkowski's votes were all verified by visual inspection Miller <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> same opportunity. The Division of Election officials responded that any recount of non-write-in votes would not be done by hand, but would be done using optical scanners.|$|E

25|$|Voter {{turnout was}} higher than {{expected}} at 58%. The results saw the Centre Party win the most votes, but they were only 0.8% ahead of the new Res Publica party. As a result, both parties won 28 seats, which was a disappointment for the Centre Party who had expected to win the most seats. Altogether the right of centre parties won 60 seats, compared to only 41 for the left wing, and so were expected to form the next government. Both the Centre and Res Publica parties said that they <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> chance to try and form the next government, while ruling out any deal between themselves. President Rüütel had to decide who he should nominate as Prime Minister and therefore be given the first chance at forming a government. On 2 April he invited {{the leader of the}} Res Publica party, Juhan Parts, to form a government, and after negotiations a coalition government composed of Res Publica, the Reform Party and the People's Union of Estonia was formed on 10 April.|$|E
25|$|The {{unemployment}} benefit should be increased and {{limited to one}} year. In this period, people would {{have to look for}} a job or education. If {{at the end of the}} year one should not succeed in finding a job, the government will offer one a job for the minimum wage. In order to create more employment, they want to implement the green tax shift which will lower taxes on lower paid labour. This would be compensated by higher taxes on pollution. In order to increase prospects for the underprivileged, it wants to invest in education, especially the vmbo (middle-level vocational education). In order to ensure that migrants have a better chance for jobs, it wants to deal firmly with discrimination, especially on the labour market. The party wants to decrease income differences by making child benefits. The party favours reform of government pensions: after 45 years of employment one <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> right to a pension. If one starts working young, one is able to stop working earlier than if one starts working when one is older. Receiving unemployment or disability benefits is counted as work, as is caring for children or family members. The system of mortgage interest deductions should be abolished over a forty-year period.|$|E
25|$|Bladud's son Leir reigns for sixty years. He has no sons, so upon {{reaching}} old age {{he decides}} to divide his kingdom among his three daughters, Goneril, Regan and Cordelia. To decide who <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> largest share, he asks his daughters how much they love him. Goneril and Regan give extravagant answers, but Cordelia answers simply and sincerely; angered, he gives Cordelia no land. Goneril and Regan are to share half the island with their husbands, the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall. Cordelia marries Aganippus, King of the Franks, and departs for Gaul. Soon Goneril and Regan and their husbands rebel and take the whole kingdom. After Leir has had all his attendants taken from him, he begins to regret his actions towards Cordelia and travels to Gaul. Cordelia receives him compassionately and restores his royal robes and retinue. Aganippus raises a Gaulish army for Leir, who returns to Britain, defeats his sons-in-law and regains the kingdom. Leir rules {{for three years and}} then dies; Cordelia inherits the throne and rules for five years before Marganus and Cunedagius, her sisters' sons, rebel against her. They imprison Cordelia; grief-stricken, she kills herself. Marganus and Cunedagius divide the kingdom between themselves, but soon quarrel and go to war with each other. Cunedagius eventually kills Marganus in Wales and retains the whole kingdom, ruling for thirty-three years. He is succeeded by his son.|$|E

The next month Mexican Commandant Felipe Neri dispatched troops to the border, where they killed five Cowboys, including Old Man Clanton, in Guadalupe Canyon.

[...] By 1514, she noted that the Pope was running low on funds, but continued to act in her family's interest. [...] She spent a year lobbying for her son-in-law to get the position of Depositor-General of the Vatican, giving her family direct access to Vatican treasuries. [...] The Medicis began to have public disputes about which of the family members and clients <b>should</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> most powerful and influential positions.

[...] About this time, she also began negotiating for a royal bride for Lorenzo, considering marriage with a Spanish princess.

Emma suggests that instead of aiming to attend college on a football scholarship, Finn should utilize his musical talent. Believing Rachel's participation to be the glee club's only chance at success at Invitationals, Finn feigns romantic interest in Rachel and takes her on a date. Rachel, realizing she is unhappy performing in the school musical and excited over Finn's interest in her, returns to the glee club. Meanwhile, Kurt, Mercedes and Tina are informed of Quinn's pregnancy by Puck (Mark Salling), who pretends Finn fathered the child though he is the actual father. Finding out about Quinn, Rachel becomes furious with Finn and confronts him, asking if he is actually attracted to her at all. Finn insists the kiss they shared was honest, but Rachel is unconvinced and defects from glee club once again, returning to the school musical, where she is given full artistic control. At Invitationals, a drunk April, accompanied by the glee club, performs Carrie Underwood's [...] "Last Name" [...] for a packed auditorium and receives the standing ovation she always dreamed of. Because she had performed drunk, Will tells April during intermission that {{she is no longer}} in the glee club.
