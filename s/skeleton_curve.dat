In our approach, we use an existing voxel carving technique for collecting point volumes consisting of a single individual. We propose a volume-to-posture procedure based on the estimation of a <b>skeleton</b> <b>curve.</b> A <b>skeleton</b> <b>curve</b> is a underlying "wire" structure for the volume is approximated using a technique we developed, called nonlinear spherical shells. Nonlinear spherical shells uses Isomap, a nonlinear dimension reduction function, with clustering, and interpolation to find points for the <b>skeleton</b> <b>curve</b> of the captured volume. Using the volume and the <b>skeleton</b> <b>curve,</b> we find rigid bodies for the volume that conform to a given hierarchy and convert the configuration of these bodies into a kinematic posture...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBased on the {{asymmetric}} {{characteristic of}} <b>skeleton</b> <b>curve</b> obtained from dynamic tests on soils, a function with double asymptotes is proposed for describing the dynamic constitutive relations of soils. The hysteresis loops observed during unloading and reloading {{show the same}} form as the <b>skeleton</b> <b>curve</b> and are constructed by taking the ultimate stress as the corresponding asymptote. The coefficient of initial unloading modulus is used {{to ensure that the}} constructed hysteresis loop fits well with the experimental data. Then, a new dynamic constitutive model considering the asymmetry of <b>skeleton</b> <b>curve</b> is elaborated. The verification tests on saturated Nanjing fine sand are performed using a hollow cylinder apparatus to verify the applicability of the UD model.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{algorithms}} for computing <b>curve</b> <b>skeletons.</b> Most {{of them have}} their own notion of what a <b>curve</b> <b>skeleton</b> is and are tailored towards a specific purpose. This makes them inadequate for general use. Recently, a formal, general definition of <b>curve</b> <b>skeletons</b> was introduced {{based on the principle}} of equal-length geodesics. This definition is computable and includes an importance measure to rank the importance of the branches of the <b>curve</b> <b>skeleton.</b> An algorithm computing <b>curve</b> <b>skeletons</b> conforming this definition is already available. The purpose of this thesis is to put this algorithm to the test and provide background information on skeletonisation where necessary. The quality of the <b>curve</b> <b>skeletons</b> produced by this method is analysed, problems are noted and possible solutions presented. The conclusion is that, while the quality of the <b>curve</b> <b>skeletons</b> computed by this method is usually good, there are border cases in which there is room for improvement. The performance is also measured and several ways to improve the performance are introduced. This includes a parallel implementation of the algorithm, as the algorithm is found to be very suitable for parallelisation. ...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} energy absorption capacity of hysteretic steel damper for earthquake protection of structures. These {{types of steel}} dampers are fabricated from mild steel plate with different geometrical shapes on the side part, namely, straight, concave, and convex shapes. The performance of the proposed device was verified experimentally {{by a series of}} tests under increasing in-plane cyclic load. The overall test results indicated that the proposed steel dampers have similar hysteretic curves, but the specimen with convex-shaped side not only showed stable hysteretic behavior but also showed excellent energy dissipation capabilities and ductility factor. Furthermore, the load-deformation relation of these steel dampers can be decomposed into three parts, namely, <b>skeleton</b> <b>curve,</b> Bauschinger part, and elastic unloading part. The <b>skeleton</b> <b>curve</b> is commonly used to obtain the main parameters, which describe the behavior of steel damper, namely, yield strength, elastic stiffness, and postyield stiffness ratio.

40|$|A {{numerical}} simulation of the hysteresis performance of corroded reinforced concrete (RC) frame columns was conducted. Moreover, {{the results obtained}} were compared with experimental data. On this basis, a degenerated three-linearity (D-TRI) restoring force model was established which could reflect the hysteresis performance of corroded RC frame columns through theoretical analysis and data fitting. Results indicated that the hysteretic bearing capacity of frame columns decreased significantly due to corrosion of the rebar. In view {{of the characteristics of}} the hysteresis curve, the plumpness of the hysteresis loop for frame columns decreased and shrinkage increased with increasing rebar corrosion. All these illustrated that the seismic energy dissipation performance of frame columns reduced but their brittleness increased. As for the features of the <b>skeleton</b> <b>curve,</b> the trends for corroded and noncorroded members were basically consistent and roughly corresponded to the features of a trilinear equivalent model. Thereby, the existing Clough hysteresis rule can be used to establish the restoring force model applicable to corroded RC frame columns based on that of the noncorroded RC members. The calculated <b>skeleton</b> <b>curve</b> and hysteresis curve of corroded RC frame columns using the D-TRI model are closer to the experimental results...|$|E

Salt spray was applied to accelerate the corrosion on the steel plates; specimens of varying degrees of corrosion were obtained in this manner.

A theoretical hysteretic model is established according to a previous experimental study. This model is described in a simple mathematical form and takes nonlinearity, pinching, strength, and stiffness deterioration into consideration. It was established in two steps: (1) a discrete coordinate method was proposed to determine the load-displacement <b>skeleton</b> <b>curve</b> of the wall, by which governing deformations and their corresponding loads of the hysteretic loops under different loading cases can be obtained; afterwards; (2) a piecewise function was adopted to capture the hysteretic loop relative to each governing deformation, the hysteretic model of the wall was further established, and additional criteria for the dominant parameters of the model were stated. Finally, the hysteretic model was validated by experimental results from other studies. The results show that elastic lateral stiffness Ke and shear capacity Fp are key factors determining the load-displacement <b>skeleton</b> <b>curve</b> of the wall; hysteretic characteristics of the wall with reinforced end studs can be fully reflected by piecewise function hysteretic model, moreover, the model has intuitional expressions with clear physical interpretations for each parameter, {{paving the way for}} predicting the nonlinear dynamic responses of mid-rise CFS structures...|$|E
