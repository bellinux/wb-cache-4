5000|$|During {{the middle}} to late 1980s, digital synthesizers and {{samplers}} largely replaced analog synthesizers. By the early 1990s however, musicians from the techno, rave and DJ scenes who wanted to produce electronic music but lacked the budget for large digital systems created a market for the then cheap <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> analog <b>equipment.</b> This increased demand for analog synthesizers towards the mid-1990s, as larger numbers of musicians gradually rediscovered the analog qualities. As a result, sounds associated with analog synths became popular again.|$|R

50|$|After missed site visit, further {{correspondence}} and twists and turns, the private contractors Hoolooman & Associates were hired {{to conduct the}} survey and valuation, reason given being that Navin Ramgoolamâ€™s government lacked the necessary quantity surveying human resources to do so. Mr Ramdyal of the Quantity Surveying Unit of the MPI felt the exercise would take at least two months and not two weeks as allegedly demanded by Mrs Hanoomanjee. Also, the new valuation is not said to be confined only to the MedPoint property after depreciation {{for the purposes of}} the purchase, but to <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> medical <b>equipment</b> and the cost of a new replacement building at current prices which Mrs Hanoomanjee allegedly wanted, hence her need for a Quantity Surveyor, who is a professional in the construction industry concerned with building costs. Hoolooman & Associates were also originally involved in the construction of the MedPoint Clinic and they valued the Land, Building and Services at Rs.145 millions (US$5 Millions). If this valuation contained the replacement cost of the building, the government would have therefore purchased a building which is non-existent and paid the seller for a fictitious building. This in itself should go to the root of the contract and be enough to set it aside.|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "sound system" [...] is {{also used}} to refer to a free party sound system, also known as a rig. The {{equipment}} includes a van, loudspeakers, amplifiers, turntable decks and cables. Larger rigs might also have a fog machine, stage lighting, video projectors and an electrical generator; the generator enables the sound system to be set up anywhere. A sound system collective is usually five or more people, with larger sound systems having more members. Equipment is owned by some and others are DJs, record producers or enthusiastic ravers who help out. They will be the people who organise free parties and teknivals and will be a group of friends with similar interests.

50|$|Difficulties {{in obtaining}} stock {{meant that the}} new Orange shop at first dealt only in <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> <b>equipment.</b> Fortunately, many musicians around that time {{preferred}} older, used or beaten up guitars as they {{were considered to be}} of better quality and have more character than the new ones available. The Orange shop was the first to cater for this market. The difficulties faced in stocking the shop lead Cooper to decide to begin designing Orange's own amplifiers and in the late autumn of 1968 Huddersfield based company Radio Craft, owned by Mat Mathias, was appointed to produce the first Orange branded amplifiers. Whilst in London, Orange shop salesman Mick Dines became closely involved with the design of Orange cabinets. As a touring musician, Dines understood the rigours equipment was subjected to on the road and was instrumental in ensuring that durability was {{at the forefront of the}} design with features such as the basketweave grillecloth and the wooden skids which not only gave strength but improved the sound dramatically by acoustically coupling the cabinet to the stage or wooden floor.It is a common misconception that the earliest Orange amplifiers were jointly produced by Orange and Matamp, the brand name that Mathias used on his own design of amplifiers. This was not the case. Radio Craft produced hi-fi guitar amplifiers which, whilst ideal for bass guitar produced a tone far too clean and flat for electric lead guitars. Early Orange Matamp amplifiers were built by Radio Craft to Cooper's design to provide the new generation of guitarists with the sustain they demanded. The front end was modified and Cooper changed the chassis from lightweight aluminium to enamelled steel. The Orange logo was designed to be clearly visible on stage. When the design was delivered to Radio Craft, Mathias suggested that a small Matamp logo be added, which as a courtesy to Mathias, Cooper agreed to, making Matamp a model name. The first of the Orange Matamp amplifiers were 100 watt valve amps and were produced in very small numbers in the rear of tobacconist shop owned by Mathias. Demand for Orange amplifiers grew quickly and Radio Craft was unable to keep up with orders. It became apparent that larger premises were vital. Mathias was unable to finance the move so in 1969, Cooper Mathias Ltd was formed to replace Radio Craft. Cooper's feeling was that a 50/50 partnership would be to the advantage of all parties rather than to simply finance Radio Craft with the benefit of cheaper overheads in Huddersfield than in London. The central plan behind Cooper Mathias was to increase capacity and productivity to a level at which the service could be offered to other amplifier companies.|$|E
