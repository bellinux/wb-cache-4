40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{relation}} between the distributional chaos and the existence of a <b>scrambled</b> triple. We show that for a continuous mapping $f$ acting on a compact metric space $(X,d) $, the possession of an infinite extremal distributionally <b>scrambled</b> set is not sufficient for the existence of a <b>scrambled</b> triple. We also construct an invariant Mycielski set with an uncountable extremal distributionally <b>scrambled</b> set without any <b>scrambled</b> triple...|$|R
40|$|In {{the random}} case setting, <b>scrambled</b> {{polynomial}} lattice rules {{as discussed in}} BD 10 enjoy more favourable strong tractablility properties than <b>scrambled</b> digital nets. This short note discusses the application of <b>scrambled</b> polynomial lattice rules to infinite-dimensional integration. In HMGNR 10, infinite-dimensional integration in the random case setting was examined in detail, and results based on <b>scrambled</b> digital nets were presented. Exploiting these improved strong tractability properties of <b>scrambled</b> polynomial lattice rules and making use of the analysis presented in HMGNR 10, we improve on the results that were achieved using <b>scrambled</b> digital nets.

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to climb Ben Nevis from the Nevis Gorge car park at Steal {{at the head of}} the road up Glen Nevis, either by the south-east ridge or via the summit of Càrn Dearg (south-west). These routes require mild <b>scrambling,</b> are shorter and steeper than the Pony Track, and tend only to be used by experienced hill walkers.|$|E
5|$|Leaf {{morphology}} is {{also very}} diverse in this large genus. Some leaves are very thin, almost needle-like (S. affine), while others are short, stubby, and arranged in rosettes (S. pulviniforme). Another group of species, such as S. scandens (climbing triggerplant) form <b>scrambling,</b> tangled mats typically propped up on aerial roots.|$|E

This is called a functional localizer. Comparing the neural response between faces and <b>scrambled</b> faces will reveal areas that are face-responsive, while comparing cortical activation between faces and objects will reveal areas that are face-selective.|$|R
40|$|For a {{dynamical}} system (X,f), X being {{a compact}} metric space with metric d and f being a continuous map X→ X, a set S⊆ X is <b>scrambled</b> if every pair (x,y) of distinct points in S is <b>scrambled,</b> i. e., _n→+∞d(f^n(x),f^n(y)) = 0 and _n→+∞d(f^n(x),f^n(y)) > 0. The system (X,f) is Li-Yorke chaotic {{if it has}} an uncountable <b>scrambled</b> set. It is known that, for interval and circle maps, {{the existence of a}} <b>scrambled</b> pair implies Li-Yorke chaos, in fact the existence of a Cantor <b>scrambled</b> set. We prove that the same result holds for graph maps. We further show that on compact countable metric spaces one <b>scrambled</b> pair implies the existence of an infinite <b>scrambled</b> set.

5|$|Tuberous sundews: These nearly 50 Australian species form an {{underground}} tuber {{to survive the}} extremely dry summers of their habitat, re-emerging in the autumn. These so-called tuberous sundews can be further divided into two groups, those that form rosettes and those that form climbing or <b>scrambling</b> stems. Tuberous sundews comprise the subgenus Ergaleium.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00, however, {{a second}} attempt to {{resupply}} B Company {{resulted in an}} Australian Iroquois helicopter being shot down by heavy ground fire, and exploding on impact. Two crew members were killed and another two injured, while another soldier was injured on the ground. With ammunition exploding among the burning wreckage a number of Australians rushed to aid the injured, <b>scrambling</b> through the debris and removing the unexploded ammunition and pulling the survivors to safety. Subsequently, another winch point was established {{to the rear of}} the Australian positions for casualty evacuation and resupply.|$|E

50|$|Pedestrian <b>scrambles,</b> {{known as}} a <b>scramble</b> {{crossing}} (sukuranburu-kōsaten), are very common in Japan, where more than over 300 such intersections exist. Japan's largest, and most famous, diagonal crossing is found in Tokyo, outside Shibuya station Over 3,000 pedestrians can cross in one <b>scramble</b> {{and has become a}} symbol of Tokyo and Japan as a whole.

Ohio State scored first when Michigan QB Forcier fumbled while <b>scrambling</b> in the end zone; the ball was {{recovered}} by Ohio State's Cameron Heyward for a TD. Michigan's only score {{of the first half}} was a 46-yard field goal. Ohio State's Brandon Saine ran in a 29-yard TD late in the second quarter to make it 14–3 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah, like {{virtually}} all {{species in the}} genus, is a <b>scrambling</b> vine. The stem usually grows along the ground, but will attempt to climb whenever it comes into contact with an object that can support it. The stem is relatively thick (≤30mm) and may reach up to 6 m in length, although it rarely exceeds 3 m. N. rajah does not produce runners as some other species in the genus, but older plants are known to form basal offshoots. This is especially common in plants from tissue culture, where numerous offshoots may form at a young age.|$|E

50|$|Mt. Whyte {{is usually}} {{combined}} with Mount Niblock (2976 m) when {{done as a}} <b>scramble.</b> However, while Mt. Niblock is rated a moderate <b>scramble,</b> Mt. Whyte {{is much more difficult}} due to additional exposure and loose rock. The <b>scramble</b> should not be attempted in snowy conditions due to considerable fall distance which would likely prove fatal. A route description can be found in <b>Scrambles</b> in the Canadian Rockies.|$|R
5|$|On Cemetery Ridge, Generals Meade and Hancock were <b>scrambling</b> to find reinforcements. Meade {{had sent}} {{virtually}} all of his available troops (including most of the XII Corps, who would be needed momentarily on Culp's Hill) to his left flank to counter Longstreet's assault, leaving {{the center of his}} line relatively weak. There was insufficient infantry on Cemetery Ridge and only a few artillery pieces, rallied from the debacle of the Peach Orchard by Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery.|$|E

5|$|There is {{very little}} voice acting in the game, {{as is the case}} in most The Legend of Zelda titles to date. Link remains silent in conversation, but grunts when attacking or injured and gasps when surprised. His {{emotions}} and responses are largely indicated visually by nods and facial expressions. Other characters have similar language-independent verbalizations, including laughter, surprised or fearful exclamations, and screams. Midna has the most voice acting—her on-screen dialogue is often accompanied by a babble of pseudo-speech, which was produced by <b>scrambling</b> English phrases sampled by Japanese voice actress Akiko Kōmoto.|$|E

5|$|A route {{popular with}} {{experienced}} hillwalkers starts at Torlundy, {{a few miles}} north-east of Fort William on the A82 road, and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis by following the Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending slightly to the CIC Hut. The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ("CMD Arête") before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest <b>scrambling</b> ability and a head for heights. In common with other approaches {{on this side of}} the mountain, it has the advantage of giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the north face, which are hidden from the Pony Track.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1814, the armies of the French Empire, under the direct command of Emperor Napoleon I, were <b>scrambling</b> to defend Eastern France against the invading Coalition Armies. Despite fighting against vastly superior forces, Napoleon managed to score a few significant victories and, between 10 and 13 February repeatedly beat Blücher’s Army of Silesia. On 13 February, reeling from his successive defeats, Blücher looked to disengage from Napoleon and instead manoeuvre with {{a part of his}} forces to fall upon the isolated VI Corps of Marshal Auguste de Marmont, who was defending Napoleon’s rear. The Prussian commander attacked and pushed back Marmont late on 13 February. Nevertheless, the Emperor had read into his enemy’s intentions and directed powerful forces to support Marmont.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} their mutual dislike, the Electress and Violante Beatrice {{attempted}} to improve Gian Gastone's poor public image together. Rumours abounded that the Grand Duke had died; it was a rarity {{for the public to}} see him. To dispel the said rumours, the Electress compelled him to make an appearance—his last one—in 1729, on the feast day of the patron saint of Florence, John the Baptist. The Ruspanti, Gian Gastone's morally corrupt entourage, hated the Electress; and she, them. Violante Beatrice tried to withdraw the Grand Duke from their sphere of influence by organising banquets. His conduct at these literally sent those in attendance <b>scrambling</b> for their carriages: he vomited repeatedly into his napkin, belched and told rude jokes. These distractions ceased upon Violante Beatrice's death in 1731.|$|E
