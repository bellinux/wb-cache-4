At the time of its release—and since the new wave era—music videos were an {{essential}} part of an artist's commercial success, as evident in the popularity of MTV, a channel with a primarily young audience. Music videos also began to be used as an art form, and Björk's visual output during this period—and her career in general—have become a clear example of the medium's artistic legitimation. Spanish writer Estíbaliz Pérez Asperilla has identified recurring motifs and themes through Björk's videography; these include nature, a magnified depiction of the singer, and spirituality. Surrealism and technology have also been identified as recurring features in Björk's visual output of this period. David Ehrlich of Time Out wrote, [...] "In addition to being one of the first artists to meaningfully explore the aesthetic and semiotic value of CG and its relationship to the body, Björk has collaborated with the likes of Michel Gondry, Spike Jonze and Chris Cunningham, pushing these directors toward their potential."

These somatic attributes varied depending on the environment and through contact with non-Hamitic stocks. Among the Western Hamites, Semitic and Negroid influences could be found in urban areas, with a Nordic strain present in the northwestern mountains. Similar non-Hamitic elements also existed among the Eastern Hamites, but with a more marked Negroid influence in areas bordering the Upper Nile and Great Lakes and a pronounced Armenoid strain in the Eastern Desert.|$|E

2500|$|In 1534, Spanish refugee Jacob Berab {{settled in}} Safed. He {{believed}} {{the time was}} ripe to reintroduce the old [...] "semikah" [...] (ordination) which would create for Jews worldwide a recognised central authority. In 1538, an assembly of Safed twenty-five rabbis ordained Berab, a step which they hoped would instigate {{the formation of a}} new Sanhedrin. But the plan faltered upon a strong and concerted protest by the chief rabbi of Jerusalem, Levi ben Jacob ibn Habib. Additionally, worried about a scheme which would invest excessive authority in a Jewish senate, possibly resulting in the first step toward the restoration of the Jewish state, the new Ottoman rulers forced Berab to flee Palestine and the plan did not materialize. The 16th-century nevertheless saw a resurgence of Jewish life in Palestine. Palestinian rabbis were instrumental producing a universally accepted manual of Jewish law and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> liturgical poems. Much of this activity occurred at Safed which had become a spiritual centre, a haven for mystics. Joseph Karo's comprehensive guide to Jewish law, the Shulchan Aruch, was considered so authoritative that the variant customs of German-Polish Jewry were merely added as supplement glosses. Some of the most celebrated hymns were written in Safed by poets such as Israel Najara and Solomon Alkabetz. The town was also a centre of Jewish mysticism, notable kabbalists included Moses Cordovero and the German-born Naphtali Hertz ben Jacob Elhanan. A new method of understanding the kabbalah was developed by Palestinian mystic Isaac Luria, and espoused by his student Chaim Vital. In Safed, the Jews developed a number of branches of trade, especially in grain, spices, textiles and dyeing. In 1577, a Hebrew printing press was established in Safed. The 8,000 or 10,000 Jews in Safed in 1555 grew to 20,000 or 30,000 {{by the end of the}} century.|$|E

Once the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hyderabad, St. Mary's Church, Secunderabad is an inspiring piece of architecture. It was built in 1847, incidentally a century before the Indian Independence. The church, although much smaller in size, bears much resemblance to the Cathedral at Medak with both adhering the Gothic Revival architectural style. Another beautiful church that has even received the INTACH award from the government of Andhra Pradesh is the All Saints Church, Secunderabad which was constructed in 1860.
