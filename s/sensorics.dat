40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the influence of different methods of primary fermentation of the vine musts on the analytical and <b>sensoric</b> parameters of the wines produced. For this goal different wine samples were produced using active dry wine yeast fermentation, spontaneous fermentation and fermentation with prepared ferment that contained original cultured yeast from local wine yard. The wines were produced from three vine varieties from year 2012 and 2013. The analytical and <b>sensoric</b> evaluation was subsequently carried out. The result of the experiment show a good and even <b>sensoric</b> quality of the wines produced using the active dry wine yeast fermentation, yet certain uniformity is apparent. On the contrary the spontaneous fermentation shows traces of unevenness in the <b>sensoric</b> quality evaluation. The most important finding is that the method that produces wine using the prepared ferment is a full alternative to the methods of spontaneous or active dry wine yeast fermentation and that in many cases leads to even better <b>sensoric</b> evaluation than these two methods. The prepared ferment method has a great potential in wine making practice mainly for high quality wines that focus on the varietal character, originality, story of origin, local tradition and "terroir"...|$|R

50|$|Many {{technical}} {{applications of}} biological objects like proteins, viruses or bacteria such as chromatography, optical information technology, <b>sensorics,</b> catalysis and drug delivery require their immobilization. Carbon nanotubes, gold particles and synthetic polymers {{are used for}} this purpose. This immobilization has been achieved predominantly by adsorption or by chemical binding {{and to a lesser}} extent by incorporating these objects as guests in host matrices.In the guest host systems, an ideal method for the immobilization of biological objects and their integration into hierarchical architectures should be structured on a nanoscale to facilitate the interactions of biological nano-objects with their environment.Due to the large number of natural or synthetic polymers available and the advanced techniques developed to process such systems to nanofibres, rods, tubes etc. make polymers a good platform for the immobilization of biological objects.|$|E
5000|$|The rise of {{piezoelectric}} {{technology is}} directly related to a set of inherent advantages. The high modulus of elasticity of many piezoelectric materials is comparable to that of many metals and goes up to 106 N/m². Even though piezoelectric sensors are electromechanical systems that react to compression, the sensing elements show almost zero deflection. This gives piezoelectric sensors ruggedness, an extremely high natural frequency and an excellent linearity over a wide amplitude range. Additionally, piezoelectric technology is insensitive to electromagnetic fields and radiation, enabling measurements under harsh conditions. Some materials used (especially gallium phosphate or tourmaline) are extremely stable at high temperatures, enabling sensors to have a working range of up to 1000 °C. Tourmaline shows pyroelectricity in addition to the piezoelectric effect; this is the ability to generate an electrical signal when the temperature of the crystal changes. This effect is also common to piezoceramic materials.

The meat has been evaluated for smell, colour, stringiness, fragility, juiciness, chewability and taste.
