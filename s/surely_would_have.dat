They told a story about escaping from the British who wanted their vessel. The story was believed, and all were sent to an ordinary POW camp. If not, they <b>surely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been executed. By coincidence they met the crew from the Frøya raft in the camp, and joined them until the war ended.|$|E

She {{was one of several}} big freighters that passed out of the St. Clair River into Lake Huron and {{straight}} into the path of the deadliest storm in the Great Lakes history. Captain A.

500|$|Director Tom Hooper {{lets his}} actors shine, {{as he did}} so marvelously in Helen Mirren's Elizabeth I and the child-killer drama Longford, but he {{complements}} them, too, with this kind of immediate point of view. And when he does give us panoramic shots from afar – of the Adams farm in Braintree, for example – they're askew, to keep us out of the classroom mode. At the end of episode 2 [...] Hooper showcases all his directorial strength with one bold choice. When the long-fretting Congress finally decides to break with Britain, he refrains from using any visual or aural tweaks. Upon the announcement, [...] "The resolution carries," [...] the scene remains perfectly silent for one long moment. The terror of responsibility hangs heavily in the room, while a victorious soundtrack <b>surely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> chased it away.|$|E
500|$|While in {{the past}} this regnal year date was assumed to refer to Ahmose, it is today {{believed}} instead to refer to Ahmose's Hyksos opponent Khamudi since the Rhind papyrus document refers to Ahmose by the inferior title of 'Prince of the South' rather than king or pharaoh, as a Theban supporter of Ahmose <b>surely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> called him. Anthony Spalinger, in a JNES 60 (2001) book review of Kim Ryholt's 1997 book, The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, c.1800–1550 BC, notes that Ryholt's translation of the middle portion of the Rhind text chronicling Ahmose's invasion of the Delta reads instead as the [...] "1st month of Akhet, 23rd day. He-of-the-South (i.e. Ahmose) strikes against Sile." [...] Spalinger stresses in his review {{that he does not}} question Ryholt's translation of the Rhind text but instead asks whether: ...|$|E

500|$|Among {{commentators}} in the 21st century, authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter describe [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long" [...] as [...] "a marvelous track" [...] and [...] "a prime {{piece of}} pop songwriting", and AllMusic's Bruce Eder praises its [...] "delectable acoustic rhythm guitar" [...] and [...] "great beat". John Metzger of The Music Box writes of the track's [...] "brightly colored radiance" [...] being a [...] "prime example" [...] of how Harrison successfully mixed elements of Spector and Martin's individual styles on Material World. While considering the album's production an improvement on All Things Must Pass, Blogcritics writer Chaz Lipp views the [...] "soaring 'Don't Let Me Wait Too Long'" [...] as {{a song that}} [...] "rank right alongside Harrison's best work". Bruce Spizer describes it as [...] "a great rocker", a [...] "hook-laden love song [...] moves at a brisk pace", and concludes: [...] "Had Apple issued the track as planned, it <b>surely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a hit."

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on December 23, 1910. The film had a wide national release, theaters which showed the film are noted in Indiana, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. Reviews of the film were mixed, with the The Moving Picture World describing the film as a [...] "heart story which will interest because it presents more or less unpleasant possibilities of this character. The acting is well done, and the film will prove popular with most audiences." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer found the film to be interesting, but stated that it [...] "would have seemed more natural had [...] not recognized [...] as her son until the appearance of , into whose care she had given her child.

500|$|Lody {{stated that}} he had been sent to the UK [...] "to remain until the first [...] {{encounter}} had taken place between the two Powers, and to send accurate information as regards the actual losses of the British Fleet", as well as to observe what he could of Fleet movements off the coast. The court martial went into an in camera session while sensitive evidence was being heard. Lody claimed that he had asked in August to be erased from military service on the grounds of poor health and to be allowed to travel to the United States. This was refused, he went on, but a member of naval intelligence whom he had previously never met coaxed him into undertaking a mission in the UK on the condition that he could go to the US afterwards. Lody told the tribunal that he was not pressured but that [...] "I have never been a coward in my life and I certainly would not be a shirker", and that he had persisted with his mission because [...] "once a man has promised to do a thing he does it, that is the understanding." [...] His services were provided [...] "absolutely as an honour and free", while he had never intended to be a spy: [...] "I was pressed for secret service, but not as a spy– oh, no. If that would have been mentioned to me at Berlin I <b>surely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> refused. The word in the sentence, I do not think it goes together." [...] He claimed that he had [...] "pledged my word of honour" [...] not to name his controller.|$|E

2500|$|... 2002 was {{the start}} of the Heyneke Meyer and Anton Leonard era. They {{defeated}} the Golden Lions 31-7 at Ellis Park thanks mainly to heroics by a 19 year old Derick Hougaard who scored a try, 2 drop goals and 5 penalties for a record 26 points. The following season they defeated the Sharks 40-19 in the final with most of the team doing duty at the 2003 World Cup. The Blue Bulls then won the 2004 final, defeating the Cheetahs by 42-33. This match saw one of the finest individual tries scored in a final. Ettiene Botha received the ball just inside the Free State half and skipped and dummied his way past a legion of defenders - epitomising the great Mannetjies Roux against the Lions of 1962 - to score a brilliant try next to the posts. A player that <b>surely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> achieved higher honours, he died in a motor car accident the following year.|$|E

2500|$|Macdonnell’s men next {{made off}} with the colony’s cattle. Colonists Duncan McNaughton, Alexander Mclean and John McLeod, riding near Frog Plain, {{observed}} the stolen cattle. They attempted to drive {{them back to the}} colony and were themselves driven off by several shots from Macdonnel’s men. One John Early’s gun misfired and he apologized stating he <b>surely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> killed McNaughton, as his gun was loaded with two balls. The Métis now took matters into their own hands. Parties of Métis paraded in front of the Red River settlement day and night singing war songs to intimidate the settlers. Some settlers were abducted and their houses were dismantled or burned. Settlers continually deserted, often taking away arms and ammunition belonging to the colony. The Nor’Westers erected another battery with one piece opposite Fort Douglas. A breastwork was thrown up around it partially made from wood taken from dismantled houses. Duncan Cameron dispatched parties of armed men along various roads to capture any wandering settlers. In June, NWC forces attacked the colony no less than 4 times, often firing at the dwelling houses from hidden positions. In every case the colonists returned fire. Four colonists and Baymen were wounded by enemy fire and John Warren was nearly killed when his wall gun bursts. Eventually, the Métis entered the Red River colony and occupied several houses including that of John Pritchard which they set up as their headquarters. Several colonists were evicted and their houses burned. After the last attack on June 11 which lasted half an hour, the colonists met with Governor Macdonell and suggested that he surrender himself to end the violence. On June 15, the Nor’Westers attacked the Red River colony in force, taking a number of prisoners and throwing up a rampart with cannon around the grain store. They also let the colonists horses loose to trample their crops. The next day, the NWC’s Alexander Mackenzie and Simon Frazer arrived from Fort William and wrote to Governor Macdonell that if he surrendered himself the colony would be left in peace. Governor Miles Macdonell subsequently surrendered himself and made a verbal agreement with the NWC for the following terms: ...|$|E
