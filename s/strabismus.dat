5|$|Damage to the {{oculomotor nerve}} (III) can cause double vision (diplopia) and {{inability}} {{to coordinate the}} movements of both eyes (<b>strabismus),</b> also eyelid drooping (ptosis) and pupil dilation (mydriasis). Lesions may also lead to inability to open the eye due to paralysis of the levator palpebrae muscle. Individuals suffering from a lesion to the oculomotor nerve may compensate by tilting their heads to alleviate symptoms due to paralysis {{of one or more}} of the eye muscles it controls.|$|E
5|$|White tigers {{are more}} {{frequently}} bred in captivity, where the comparatively small gene pool {{can lead to}} inbreeding. This has given white tigers a greater likelihood of being born with physical defects, such as cleft palate, scoliosis (curvature of the spine), and <b>strabismus</b> (squint). Even apparently healthy white tigers generally do not live {{as long as their}} orange counterparts. Attempts have been made to cross white and orange tigers to remedy this, often mixing with other subspecies in the process.|$|E
5|$|An {{increase}} in intracranial pressure {{may lead to}} impairment of the optic nerves (II) due to compression of the surrounding veins and capillaries, causing swelling of the eyeball (papilloedema). A cancer, such as an optic glioma, may also impact the optic nerve (II). A pituitary tumour may compress the optic tracts or the optic chiasm of the optic nerve (II), leading to visual field loss. A pituitary tumour may also extend into the cavernous sinus, compressing the oculuomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI), leading to double-vision and <b>strabismus.</b> These nerves may also be affected by herniation of the temporal lobes of the brain through the falx cerebri.|$|E
5|$|Néstor Carlos Kirchner {{was born}} on 25 February 1950, in Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz, a federal {{territory}} at the time. His father, Néstor Carlos Kirchner Sr., met the Chilean María Juana Ostoić by telegraphy. They had three children: Néstor, Alicia, and María Cristina. Néstor {{was part of the}} third generation of Kirchners living in the city. As a result of pertussis, he developed <b>strabismus</b> at an early age; however, he refused medical treatment because he considered his eye part of his self-image. When Kirchner was in high school he briefly considered becoming a teacher, but poor diction hampered him; he was also unsuccessful at basketball.|$|E
25|$|Ophthalmologic {{problems}} include <b>strabismus.</b> This requires early identification {{to avoid}} amblyopia. Surgery or patching are usually necessary to treat <b>strabismus</b> if diagnosed early. Refractive errors {{in patients with}} FXS are also common.|$|E
25|$|Also when {{children}} with congenital (infantile) <b>strabismus</b> (e.g. infantile esotropia) receive <b>strabismus</b> surgery {{within the first}} few years or two of their life, this goes along with the hope that they may yet develop their full potential for binocular vision including stereopsis.|$|E
25|$|Eye {{misalignments}} (<b>strabismus)</b> are common, {{but may be}} treatable.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} <b>strabismus</b> {{findings}} is large angle exotropias {{which can be}} treated by maximal bilateral eye surgery, but due to the progressive nature of the disease, <b>strabismus</b> may recur. Those that have diplopia as a result of asymmetric ophthalmoplegia maybe corrected with prisms or with surgery to create a better alignment of the eyes.|$|E
25|$|Because her <b>strabismus</b> {{was never}} corrected, Julia almost always posed in profile for portraits.|$|E
25|$|Eyes: <b>Strabismus,</b> {{optic nerve}} {{hypoplasia}} (which may cause light sensitivity, decreased visual acuity, or involuntary eye movements).|$|E
25|$|In {{cases of}} {{acquired}} <b>strabismus</b> with double vision (diplopia), it is long-established {{state of the}} art to aim at curing the double vision {{and at the same time}} recovering a patient's earlier ability for stereo vision. For example, a patient may have had full stereo vision but later had diplopia due to a medical condition, losing stereo vision. In this case, medical interventions, including vision therapy and <b>strabismus</b> surgery, may remove the double vision and recover the stereo vision which had temporarily been absent in the patient.|$|E
25|$|After {{being treated}} for <b>strabismus</b> in childhood, he refused to wear an eye patch. As a consequence, he has limited sight in one eye and lacks normal {{stereoscopic}} vision.|$|E
25|$|In {{almost all}} of Pearse's portraits he struck a {{sideways}} pose, concealing his left side. This was to hide a <b>strabismus</b> or squint in his left eye, which he felt was an embarrassing condition.|$|E
25|$|Stereopsis {{recovery}} {{has been}} reported to have occurred in a few adults as a result of either medical treatments including <b>strabismus</b> surgery and vision therapy, or spontaneously after a stereoscopic 3D cinema experience.|$|E
25|$|Eye {{and vision}} {{screening}} {{that can be}} performed within the few months of life include: <b>strabismus</b> screening using the Hirschberg test (or more recently using binocular retinal birefringence screening for higher precision), and retinoblastoma screening using the red reflex. Further eye examination may be called for in some cases.|$|E
25|$|Duane {{syndrome}} is a congenital rare type of <b>strabismus</b> most commonly {{characterized by the}} inability of the eye to move outwards. The syndrome was first described by ophthalmologists Jakob Stilling (1887) and Siegmund Türk (1896), and subsequently named after Alexander Duane, who discussed the disorder in more detail in 1905.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, in a {{study in}} which a group of 17 adults and older {{children}} of at least 8 years of age, all of whom received <b>strabismus</b> surgery and post-operative evaluation after long-standing untreated infantile esotropia, most showed binocular fusion when tested with Bagolini lenses and an increased visual field, but none demonstrated stereo fusion or stereopsis.|$|E
25|$|In ophthalmology, {{binocular}} retinal birefringence {{screening of}} the Henle fibers (photoreceptor axons that go radially outward from the fovea) provides a reliable detection of <b>strabismus</b> and possibly also of anisometropic amblyopia. Furthermore, scanning laser polarimetry utilises the birefringence of the optic nerve fibre layer to indirectly quantify its thickness, which is of use in the assessment and monitoring of glaucoma.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{investigations}} into post-surgical stereopsis is {{a publication of}} 2005 that reported on a total of 43 adults over 18 years of age who had surgical correction after having lived with from constant-horizontal <b>strabismus</b> for more than 10 years with no previous surgery or stereopsis, with visual acuity of 20/40 or more also in the deviating eye; in this group, stereopsis was present in 80% of exotropes and 31% of esotropes, with the recovery of stereopsis and stereoacuity being uncorrelated {{to the number of}} years the deviation had persisted. A study that was published 2006 included, aside an extensive review of investigations on stereopsis recovery of the last decades, a re-evaluation of all those patients who had had congenital or early-onset <b>strabismus</b> with a large constant horizontal divergence and had undergone <b>strabismus</b> surgery in the years 1997–1999 in a given clinic, excluding those who had a history of neurologic or systemic diseases or with organic retinal diseases. Among the resulting 36 subjects aged 6–30 years, many had regained binocular vision (56% according to an evaluation with Bagolini striated glasses, 39% with Titmus test, 33% with Worth 4-dot test, and 22% with Random dot E test) and 57% had stereoacuity of 200 sec of arc of better, leading to the conclusion that some degrees of stereopsis can be achieved even in cases of infantile or early-childhood strabism. Another study  found that some chronically strabismic adults with good vision could recover fusion and stereopsis by means of surgical alignment.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of Freeman–Sheldon syndrome include drooping {{of the upper}} eyelids, <b>strabismus,</b> low-set ears, a long philtrum, gradual hearing loss, scoliosis, and walking difficulties. Gastroesophageal reflux has been noted during infancy, but usually improves with age. The tongue may be small, and the limited movement of the soft palate may cause nasal speech. Often there is an H- or Y-shaped dimpling of the skin over the chin.|$|E
25|$|Stereoacuity {{is limited}} by the visual acuity of the eyes, and in {{particular}} by the visual acuity of the weaker eye. That is, the more a patient's vision of any one of the two eyes is degraded compared to the 20/20 vision standard, the lower are the prospects of improving or re-gaining stereo vision, unless visual acuity itself were improved by other means. <b>Strabismus</b> surgery itself does not improve visual acuity.|$|E
25|$|Spastic diplegia (the lower {{extremities}} {{are affected}} {{with little to}} no upper-body spasticity). The {{most common form of}} the spastic forms. Most people with spastic diplegia are fully ambulatory and have a scissors gait. Flexed knees and hips to varying degrees are common. Hip problems, dislocations, and in three-quarters of spastic diplegics, also <b>strabismus</b> (crossed eyes), can be present as well. In addition, these individuals are often nearsighted. The intelligence of a person with spastic diplegia is unaffected by the condition.|$|E
25|$|To date {{there is}} no {{treatment}} for ocular albinism, probably because {{little is known about}} the receptor function and its role in the pathophysiology of the condition. Though surgery for <b>strabismus</b> is sometimes helpful, there does not seem to be a sure remedy for it until the cause of ocular albinism is well established. However, with the recent discovery of the upstream ligand (L-DOPA) and the discovery of Oa1's possible downstream G alpha partner (Gai3) the Oa1 pathway is becoming clearer and future of Oa1 research looks promising.|$|E
25|$|Stereoscopic acuity is {{the ability}} to detect {{differences}} in depth with the two eyes. For more complex targets, stereoacuity is similar to normal monocular visual acuity, or around 0.6–1.0 arc minutes, but for much simpler targets, such as vertical rods, may be as low as only 2 arc seconds. Although stereoacuity normally corresponds very well with monocular acuity, it may be very poor, or absent, even in subjects with normal monocular acuities. Such individuals typically have abnormal visual development when they are very young, such as an alternating <b>strabismus,</b> or eye turn, where both eyes rarely, or never, point in the same direction and therefore do not function together.|$|E
25|$|Monovision {{is the use}} of single-vision lenses (one {{focal point}} per lens) to focus an eye (typically the {{dominant}} one) for distance vision and the other for near work. The brain then learns to use this setup to see clearly at all distances. A technique called modified monovision uses multifocal lenses and also specializes one eye for distance and the other for near, thus gaining the benefits of both systems. Alternatively, a person may simply wear reading glasses over their distance contact lenses. Care is advised for persons with a previous history of <b>strabismus</b> and those with significant phorias, who are at risk of eye misalignment under monovision. Studies have shown no adverse effect to driving performance in adapted monovision contact lens wearers.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, rhinoplastic {{technique}} was refined by surgeons {{such as the}} Berlin University professor of surgery Karl Ferdinand von Gräfe (1787–1840), who published Rhinoplastik (Rebuilding the Nose, 1818) wherein he described fifty-five (55) historical plastic surgery procedures (Indian rhinoplasty, Italian rhinoplasty, etc.), and his technically innovative free-graft nasal reconstruction (with a tissue-flap harvested from the patient’s arm), and surgical approaches to eyelid, cleft lip, and cleft palate corrections. Dr. von Gräfe’s protégé, the medical and surgical polymath Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach (1794–1847), who {{was among the first}} surgeons to anaesthetize the patient before performing the nose surgery, published Die Operative Chirurgie (Operative Surgery, 1845), which became a foundational medical and plastic surgical text. (see <b>strabismus,</b> torticollis) Moreover, the Prussian Jacques Joseph (1865–1934) published Nasenplastik und sonstige Gesichtsplastik (Rhinoplasty and other Facial Plastic Surgeries, 1928), which described refined surgical techniques for performing nose-reduction rhinoplasty via internal incisions.|$|E
25|$|The orange litter-mates {{of white}} tigers are not prone to <b>strabismus.</b> Siamese cats and albinos of every species {{which have been}} studied all exhibit the same visual pathway {{abnormality}} found in white tigers. Siamese cats are also sometimes cross-eyed, as are some albino ferrets. The visual pathway abnormality was first documented in white tigers in the brain of a white tiger called Moni after he died, although his eyes were of normal alignment. The abnormality {{is that there is}} a disruption in the optic chiasm. The examination of Moni's brain suggested the disruption is less severe in white tigers than it is in Siamese cats. Because of the visual pathway abnormality, by which some optic nerves are routed to the wrong side of the brain, white tigers have a problem with spatial orientation, and bump into things until they learn to compensate. Some tigers compensate by crossing their eyes. When the neurons pass from the retina to the brain and reach the optic chiasma, some cross and some do not, so that visual images are projected to the wrong hemisphere of the brain. White tigers cannot see as well as normal tigers and suffer from photophobia, like albinos.|$|E
25|$|OA1 is {{recognized}} by many different symptoms. Reduced visual acuity {{is accompanied by}} involuntary movements of the eye termed as nystagmus. Astigmatism is a condition wherein there occurs significant refractive error. Moreover, ocular albino eyes become crossed, a condition called as ‘lazy eyes’ or <b>strabismus.</b> Since very little pigment is present the iris becomes translucent and reflects light back. It appears green to blueish red. However, {{the most important part}} of the eye, the fovea which is responsible for acute vision, does not develop properly, probably indicating the role of melanin in the development stages of the eye. Some affected individuals may also develop photophobia/photodysphoria. All these symptoms are due to lack of pigmentation of the retina. Moreover, in an ocular albino eye, nerves from back of the eye to the brain may not follow the usual pattern of routing. In an ocular albino eye, more nerves cross from back of the eye to the opposite side of the brain instead of going to the both sides of the brain as in a normal eye. An ocular albino eye appears blueish pink in color with no pigmentation at all unlike a normal eye. Carrier women have regions of hypo- and hyper-pigmentation due to X-inactivation and partial iris transillumination and do not show any other symptoms exhibited by those affected by OA1.|$|E
500|$|During {{the same}} period, other {{researchers}} developed alternative, more radical theories. The ophthalmologists August Goldschmidt and Germán Beritens argued that El Greco painted such elongated human figures {{because he had}} vision problems (possibly progressive astigmatism or <b>strabismus)</b> that made him see bodies longer than they were, and {{at an angle to}} the perpendicular; the physician Arturo Perera, however, attributed this style to the use of marijuana. Michael Kimmelman, a reviewer for The New York Times, stated that [...] "to Greeks [...] became the quintessential Greek painter; to the Spanish, the quintessential Spaniard".|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{majority}} of adults will experience some improvement in binocular function after <b>strabismus</b> surgery {{even if the}} <b>strabismus</b> has been longstanding.

2500|$|Outside of India, inbred white tigers {{have been}} prone to crossed eyes, a {{condition}} known as <b>strabismus,</b> {{an example of}} which is [...] "Clarence the cross-eyed lion", due to incorrectly routed visual pathways in the brains of white tigers. When stressed or confused, all white tigers cross their eyes. <b>Strabismus</b> is associated with white tigers of mixed Bengal x Siberian ancestry. The only pure-Bengal white tiger reported to be cross-eyed was Mohini's daughter Rewati. <b>Strabismus</b> is directly linked to the white gene {{and is not a}} separate consequence of inbreeding.|$|E

Common manifestations include ataxia; seizures; retinopathy; liver fibrosis; coagulopathies; failure to thrive; dysmorphic features (e.g., inverted nipples and subcutaneous fat pads; and <b>strabismus.</b> [...] If an MRI is obtained, cerebellar atrophy and hypoplasia is a common finding.|$|E
2500|$|Julia {{was born}} with <b>strabismus</b> (more {{commonly}} known as [...] "crossed eyes") which prevents both eyes from lining {{up in the same}} direction.
