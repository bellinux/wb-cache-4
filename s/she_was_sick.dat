5|$|Sarita began turning villainous on the June 25 {{episode of}} Xplosion, when she {{interfered}} and helped Wilde defeat Daffney {{to end the}} team's long losing streak. The following week, when Wilde confronted her tag team partner and explained {{that she did not}} want to win by cheating, Sarita claimed that she was a winner and, unlike Wilde, did not need her tag team partner's help in her match against Daffney. After Sarita was defeated by Daffney in a singles match, Wilde came to the ring and stopped her tag team partner from attacking her opponent. On the July 1 episode of Impact!, Sarita cemented her villainous turn by attacking Wilde after she had lost her match against the Knockouts Champion Madison Rayne, proclaiming <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> of losing matches. Sarita and Wilde faced each other on the following episode of Xplosion, with Sarita picking up the pinfall victory by putting her feet on the ropes for leverage. On the July 15 episode of Impact!, Sarita defeated Wilde again, this time in a Street Fight. At the July 26 tapings of Impact!, Stock tore her triceps and was expected to miss two months of in-ring action. She returned at the September 6 tapings of Xplosion, defeating Daffney.|$|E

25|$|On the April 8 {{episode of}} SmackDown, {{tension between the}} team rose when McCool refused to tag Layla into a match against Kelly and Phoenix. Layla {{continued}} trying to fix their relationship, but McCool was resistant. Tension was further highlighted in a SmackDown scene where the two were seen undergoing couples therapy. When Layla lost a singles match against Kelly despite McCool's attempts to help her, McCool told Layla <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> of doing all her work for her, and shoved her over. Finally, On the April 22 episode of SmackDown, McCool turned on Layla by attacking her after the therapy session, thereby disbanding LayCool. During the 2011 WWE Draft, McCool cost Layla a match against Eve Torres. After the match, McCool tried to taunt and bully Layla again, however Layla snapped after all her efforts at trying to keep LayCool together, and viciously attacked McCool, saying <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> of her, before throwing her at the announce table, thus turning face in the process. On the April 29 episode of SmackDown, Layla and McCool fought to a no contest. After the match, Layla challenged McCool to a No Count Out, No Disqualification match at Extreme Rules. McCool accepted on one condition that the loser leaves WWE. On May 1 at Extreme Rules 2011, Layla defeated McCool which meant {{she had to leave}} WWE. After the match, a debuting Kharma came out and attacked McCool with the Implant Buster. Layla retired on July 29, 2015.|$|E

25|$|John Donne {{was under}} the matronage of Lucy Russell {{during the time that}} Boulstred fell ill and died. As {{previously}} mentioned, he visited her when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> and concluded that she was suffering from hysteria. After she died, he wrote two poems in her honor, “Elegy on Mistress Boulstred” and “Elegy Upon the Death of Mistress Boulstred.” The former poem characterizes Death as an “all-consuming glutton who swallows the good” and argues that Boulstred was one of the good ones. The latter poem says that Death is no longer needed because Boulstred was the epitome of virtue, and now that she is dead, it is like the entire world is dead. Donne most likely wrote these elegies in the hopes of getting a reward from his literary matron Lucy Russell.|$|E

Because {{he never would have}} left her when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sick,</b> he's a good guy. And I'm not saying that Alex ever consciously thought, I can’t leave her while she's sick, but now that she's not, now that she seems like she's going to get better, it just comes to him. He deserves more. He's a good guy and he deserves more. But loving Izzie showed him that he can be good, is good. So it was a little gift. And when he tells Izzie he's done, he's not bitter or angry, he's just done." [...] The writing of the two-part season six finale, caused struggle to Rhimes. She elaborated on this: ...|$|E

[...] The anthology series [...] explores the characters' reactions to this relocation, with Anole featuring in his own story, [...] "Big Boy Pants". [...] The story depicts Cannonball teaching the younger X-Men how to farm their own crops, but Anole argues {{that it is a}} waste of time since they could just buy their food from a store. [...] He looks to Magik for agreement, but she responds by teleporting him to Limbo for five days without food or water. [...] Eventually she returns to bring him water, and Anole tells her that he learned his lesson: without their own food supply, the mutant race could die. [...] Magik informs him that this was not a lesson and that she merely sent him to Limbo because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sick</b> of looking at him. [...] She returns them both to Utopia and Anole resumes farming, too afraid of Magik to tell anyone what happened. He is almost killed by the mutant Sack, who wanted his own corner of Utopia.|$|E

There are a lot of people who do not want to see Frank and Peggy married – Grant being one of them – and it remains to be seen whether they will get through the day without a major upset. And as if the wedding is not gripping enough, there are certainly shocking revelations back at the Vic." [...] In the eventual episode, it was actually Grant Mitchell who persuaded his mother to marry Frank – with whom he had been feuding following his accidental killing of wife Tiffany – after Peggy was having second thoughts, thinking that Frank was only marrying her out of pity. Nearly 20 million viewers watched Peggy and Frank marry.|$|E
