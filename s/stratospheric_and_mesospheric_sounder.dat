50|$|On {{the third}} day of the mission, the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) was {{deployed}} from Discovery's payload bay 350 statute miles above Earth to study human effects on the planet's atmosphere and its shielding ozone layer. The UARS mission objectives were to provide an increased understanding of the energy input into the upper atmosphere, global photochemistry of the upper atmosphere, dynamics of the upper atmosphere, the coupling among these processes, and the coupling between the upper and lower atmosphere. This provided data for a coordinated study of the structure, chemistry, energy balance, and physical action of the Earth's middle atmosphere - thatslice of air between 10 and 60 miles above the Earth. The UARS was the first major flight element of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, a multi-year global research program that would use ground-based, airborne, and space-based instruments to study the Earth as a complete environmental system. UARS had ten sensing and measuring devices: Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer (CLAES); Improved <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mesospheric</b> <b>Sounder</b> (ISAMS); Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS); Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE); High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI); Wind Imaging Interferometer (WlNDII); Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM); Solar/Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE); Particle Environment Monitor (PEM) and Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM II). UARS's initial 18-month mission was extended several times - it was finally retired after 14 years of service.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the pressure-modulation technique, which is {{employed by the}} <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> <b>sounder</b> (SAMS) experiment on the satellite Nimbus 7, and by an advanced version (the improved <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> <b>sounder</b> or ISAMS) now under construction for the forthcoming Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite programme. SAMS measurements of methane and nitrous oxide for the three-year period from 1 January 1979 to 31 December 1981 are presented, and show the latitudinal and seasonal variability of the average concentration of these long-lived minor constituents. From the observed behaviour, {{some aspects of the}} circulation of the middle atmosphere are identified and their possible origins discussed. -from Author...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of microwave instrumetns {{to sound the}} atmosphere is reveiwed, focusing on the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU). The AMSU is planned for operation in a geosynchronous orbit or in LEO near 118 GHz. The three main AMSU subsystems are described: a 15 -channel temperature sounder with a 50 -km resolution, a 5 -channel atmospheric moisture sounder with a 15 -km resolution, and a 7 -channel <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> temperature <b>sounder</b> with 150 -km resolution. In addition, the potential for limb-sounding instruments is considered...|$|R

30|$|CESM 1 (WACCM) has full tropospheric, <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> chemistry, with 57 {{chemical}} species (Neal et al. 2012). The gas-phase chemistry is coupled to the Modal Aerosol Model (Neal et al. 2012). The stratospheric distributions of long-lived species {{are taken from}} previously performed CESM 1 (WACCM) simulations.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an observational {{study of the}} mesospheric temperature inversion layer with Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) Improved <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mesospheric</b> <b>Sounder</b> (ISAMS) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS).

40|$|We present {{preliminary}} {{results of the}} validation of ozone measurements from the Improved <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mesospheric</b> <b>Sounder</b> (ISAMS). The indications are that the ISAMS provides ozone data which generally agrees with other experiments and climatological values, except in regions of large thermal gradients or high aerosol loading.

40|$|Simultaneous {{observations}} of Polar Stratospheric Cloud aerosol extinction and HNO 3 mixing ratios over Scandinavia are examined for January 9 - 10, 1992. Data {{measured by the}} Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon, Spectrometer (CLAES), and Improved <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mesospheric</b> <b>Sounder</b> (ISAMA) experiments on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) are examined at locations adjacent to parcel trajectory positions...|$|E
40|$|Inversion of the {{measurements}} {{obtained by the}} infrared limb scanner on the Nimbus 6 satellite has demonstrated that the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> temperatures <b>and</b> ozone concentrations may be obtained remotely from space with accuracy and precision comparable to in situ methods. Such global data have many applications in middle atmospheric research and operational temperature sounding...|$|R
30|$|In this study, we have {{analyzed}} mesospheric winds from equatorial and low-latitude {{locations in}} Brazil and India, F region evening vertical drift velocity and spread F data from Brazil, and Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics/Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (TIMED/SABER) temperature data at <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> heights {{during the period}} from 1 August and 31 October 2005.|$|R
30|$|We can, consequently, {{conclude}} that the mesospheric circulation is {{more sensitive to the}} underlying SST compared to the stratospheric circulation, as is made evident by the regional differences in the vertical and horizontal wind maps. The discrepancy between the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> circulation {{can be explained by the}} fact that the stratospheric dynamics are mainly driven by the insolation of stratospheric ozone.|$|R
40|$|Key to {{understanding}} the chlorine chemistry in the polar stratosphere is the measurement of polar stratospheric clouds, chlorine monoxide, and the reservoir gas chlorine nitrate. Polar stratospheric clouds are seen by the Improved <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mesospheric</b> <b>Sounder,</b> ISAMS, and chlorine nitrate has been measured by the Cryogen Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer, CLAES. Both ISAMS and CLAES make measurements by looking at infrared emission from cloud particles and trace gases.

40|$|Abstract — The {{objective}} of the Microwave Limb Sounder THz module on the Aura satellite is to measure <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> OH. This paper describes the optical design, alignment, calibration, and performance of the THz module. The calibration uncertainty for one limb scan is substantially less than the precision due to radiometric noise. For averages of many scans, the dominant calibration uncertainty of 2 % is due to uncertainty in beam efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Intercomparison {{of middle}} {{atmosphere}} meteorological {{data from a}} variety of sources is discussed. The primary aim was to intercompare data on <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> temperatures {{from a variety of}} sounding systems in order to characterize the differences, to understand the reasons for them, and to help users of the data to understand how these differences will affect derived quantities such as heat and momentum fluxes which are significant in studies of stratospheric dynamics...|$|R

A characterization of these differences With parameters such as the solar zenith angle (SZA) and kinetic temperature has been done and {{explained in terms of}} atmospheric processes by using a non-LTE radiative transfer model. The goal of these continuing studies is to implement these non-LTE effects in the operational retrieval of H 2 O. (C) 1999 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The Improved <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mesospheric</b> <b>Sounder</b> (ISAMS) is {{designed}} to measure the Earths middle atmosphere {{in the range of}} 4. 6 to 16. 6 micorns. This paper considers all the coated optical elements in two radiometric test channels. (Analysis of the spectral response will be presented as a seperate paper at this symposium, see Sheppard et al). Comparisons between the compued spectral performance and measurements from actual coatings will be discussed: These will include substrate absorption simulations.

40|$|The Improved <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mesospheric</b> <b>Sounder</b> (ISAMS) is {{producing}} the first global measurements of emission from the 1 yields 0 band of nitric oxide (NO). The emission {{from the lower}} thermosphere has been examined and is seen to increase dramatically at times corresponding to high solar activity. The temporal and geographical extent of the effect is reported, and possible mechanisms for the enhanced emission are discussed. The need for adequate representation of thermospheric NO emission in order to retrieve NO number densities at all heights from ISAMS data is discussed, as are prospects for science studies using such NO number density measurements...|$|E
40|$|The Urbana radar, which {{operates}} at 40. 92 MHz with a peak power of about 1. 2 MW into a 100 x 120 m {{phased array antenna}} was improved. An accelerated data-acquisition system, a beam-steering system, and a transmit/receive switch were installed. With these changes, the radar is in regular operations for two hours every day around local noon gathering <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> data. Special campaigns are mounted in addition under severe weather conditions...|$|R
40|$|The basic ideas {{involved}} in the processing of occultation data are reviewed, with emphasis on sources of uncertainty. The results from the beta Scorpii event are discussed in detail, and those from Pioneers 10 and 11 in as much detail as possible at present. It is suggested that <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> temperatures are probably between 170 and 200 K. The implications of an exospheric temperature as hot as 800 K are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{analyses}} of various <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> species, including aerosols, ions, ozone, and some minor species, are presented, based on measurements obtained from rocket, balloon, aircraft, and satellite missions. In addition, studies concerning temperature and density {{characteristics of the}} stratosphere and mesosphere are included, as well as discussions on the various sensing and measurement techniques. Finally, dynamics and turbulence measurements are examined; consideration is given to radar winds, solar X-ray and HF radiowave absorption, and ionization irregularities...|$|R
40|$|Observations of zonally average {{temperature}} from the Nimbus- 7 <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mesospheric</b> <b>Sounder</b> in 1979 - 82 show {{the existence of}} a significant season variation in the equatorial semiannual oscillation. The first semiannual cycle, beginning in the Northern Hemisphere winter (December-May), is much stronger than the second (June-November) cycle. The balanced winds are calculated from satellite data, showing corresponding seasonality in the semiannual oscillation wind regimes. Strong coupling is observed during the first cycle between equatorial and North Polar temperature. A model of this coupling suggests that planetary Rossby wave momentum deposition in the northern winter is the cause of the seasonal variation in the easterly phase of the semiannual oscillation...|$|E
40|$|Data {{from the}} <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mesospheric</b> <b>Sounder</b> (SAMS) on the Nimbus 7 satellite, {{for the three}} years from January 1979 -December 1981, are used to prepare a {{reference}} model for the long-lived trace gases methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) in the stratosphere. The model is presented in tabular form on seventeen pressure surfaces from 20 to 0. 1 mb, in 10 ° latitude bins from 50 S to 70 N, and for each month of the year. The {{means by which the}} data quality and interannual variability, and some of the more interesting globally and seasonally variable features of the data are discussed briefly. © 1987...|$|E
40|$|The {{planetary}} wave dynamics of stratospheric sudden warmings in the Northern Hemisphere {{for a large}} number of observed events that occurred during winters from 1970 to 1975 and 1978 to 1981 are investigated. The analysis describes wave propagation and zonal flow interaction from the troposphere upwards to near 50 km, and in some years to near 80 km. Three primary topics are covered here: (1) the interaction of zonally propagating and quasi-stationary {{planetary wave}}s during warming events; (2) planetary wave influence on zonal flow near the stratopause; and (3) planetary wave propagation to near 80 km as seen from <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mesospheric</b> <b>Sounder</b> (SAMS) data...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} the measurements of hydroxyl radical {{in the upper}} atmosphere using lidar from the Space Shuttle. The measurement of the latitudinal and diurnal variation of OH would provide tests for <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> chemistry; two lidar systems aboard the Space Shuttle are described with the first providing the best {{signal to noise ratio}} for nighttime measurements at altitudes above 40 km, and the second giving a better performance during the day and at lower altitudes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{introduces}} <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> {{hydroperoxyl radical}} (HO 2) estimates from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) using an offline retrieval (i. e. run {{separately from the}} standard MLS algorithm). This new data set provides two daily zonal averages, one during daytime from 10 to 0. 0032 hPa (using day-minus-night differences between 10 and 1 hPa to ameliorate systematic biases) and one during nighttime from 1 to 0. 0032 hPa. The vertical resolution of this new data set varies from about 4 km at 10 hPa to around 14 km at 0. 0032 hPa. A description of the methodology and an error analysis are presented. Comparisons against the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), the Superconducting Submillimeter-Wave Limb-Emission Sounder (SMILES) and the Far Infrared Spectrometer (FIRS- 2) measurements, as well as photochemical simulations, demonstrate the robustness of the retrieval and indicate that the retrieval is sensitive enough to detect mesospheric HO 2 layers during both day and night. This new data set is the first long-term HO 2 <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> satellite record <b>and</b> it provides needed constraints to help resolve the O 3 deficit problem and the "HO x dilemma"...|$|R
40|$|While {{stirring}} {{and mixing}} {{properties in the}} stratosphere are reasonably well understood {{in the context of}} balanced (slow) dynamics, as is evidenced in numerous studies of chaotic advection, the strongly enhanced presence of high-frequency gravity waves in the mesosphere gives rise to a significant unbalanced (fast) component to the flow. The present investigation analyses result from two idealized shallow-water numerical simulations representative of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> dynamics on a quasi-horizontal isentropic surface. A generalization of the Hua–Klein Eulerian diagnostic to divergent flow reveals that velocity gradients are strongly influenced by the unbalanced component of the flow. The Lagrangian diagnostic of patchiness nevertheless demonstrates the persistence of coherent features in the zonal component of the flow, in contrast to the destruction of coherent features in the meridional component. Single-particle statistics demonstrate t 2 scaling for both the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> regimes in the case of zonal dispersion, and distinctive scaling laws for the two regimes in the case of meridional dispersion. This is in contrast to two-particle statistics, which in the mesospheric (unbalanced) regime demonstrate a more rapid approach to Richardson’s t 3 law in the case of zonal dispersion and is evidence of enhanced meridional dispersion...|$|R
40|$|Zonally {{averaged}} equatorial temperatures obtained aboard Nimbus 7 by the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> <b>sounder</b> (SAMS) {{are compared}} to comparable {{data obtained from}} the limb IR monitor of the stratosphere. The SAMS data are shown to confirm the seasonal asymmetry in semiannual wind regimes previously noted in rocketsonde observations near the equator. Two explanations for the asymmetry are considered: (1) an improved Kelvin and gravity wave transmissivity in stronger equatorial easterlies (resulting from planetary Rossby wave momentum transport), implying stronger westerly mean flow acceleration in the first cycle than in the second; and (2) evidence of strong polar-tropical coupling in the northern winter indicating that mean meridional circulations are present on a global scale...|$|E
40|$|Data sets {{resulting}} from the first nine years of operations of the Nimbus- 7 Satellite are briefly described. After {{a brief description of}} the Nimbus- 7 Mission, each of the eight experiments on-board the satellite (Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), Earth Radiation Budget (ERB), Limb Infrared Monitor of the Stratosphere (MIMS), Stratospheric Aerosol Measurement II (SAM II), <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mesospheric</b> <b>Sounder</b> (SAMS), Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet/Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (SBUV/TOMS), Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and the Temperature Humidity Infrared Radiometer (THIR) are introduced and their respective data products are described in terms of media, general format, and suggested applications.

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{objectives of}} the Improved <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mesospheric</b> <b>Sounder</b> (ISAMS) experiment involve the measurement of global temperature and composition profiles from an instrument on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS). This paper discusses these objectives {{in the light of}} the data acquired during the first ten months of the mission. Interesting interim results include detailed observations of a stratospheric sudden warming and a nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) "Noxon cliff", enhanced thermospheric nitric oxide (NO) production during a solar flare, strongly increased concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) over the winter poles, non-LTE behaviour of mesospheric water vapour (H 2 O), and unexpected transport properties of volcanic aerosol, and the long-lived tracers methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). © 1994...|$|E
40|$|POLE (Polar Ozone Lidar Experiment) is a {{cooperative}} project between the French and Italian services. It was {{started with the}} implementation of a first depolarization backscattering lidar for measurements both of background <b>stratospheric</b> aerosols <b>and</b> Polar <b>Stratospheric</b> Clouds (PSCs). A complex Ozone lidar was also installed which will replace the backscattering system and extend its measurements to tropospheric <b>and</b> <b>stratospheric</b> Ozone <b>and</b> to <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> temperatures. This new system allows also the measurement of the backscattered and depolarized signal produced by PSCs and background aerosols. The depolarization technique seemed to be quite efficient in the detection of different types of PSCs...|$|R
30|$|Figure 6 {{shows the}} zonal {{mean of the}} zonal wind for the PDE (Fig. 6 a) and the TLE (6 b), from 5 to 110 km altitude. A {{comparison}} between the two figures reveals that the TLE zonal mean zonal wind is markedly different from the PDE equivalent. In the PDE, the southward air motion contributes to the geostrophic zonal wind. On the TLE, on the other hand, the air motion is southward in the Northern Hemisphere and northward in the Southern Hemisphere at tropospheric, middle <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> altitudes.|$|R
40|$|Earth orbital instruments, {{designed}} to measure the vertical and spatial distribution of atmospheric water vapor is discussed. Specifically, {{the operation of the}} Limb Infrared Monitor of the Stratosphere (LIMS) experiment is examined. The LIMS is a six channel limb scanning radiometer that was launched aboard Nimbus 7 in 1978. Profiles of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>and</b> <b>mesospheric</b> temperature, water vapor, and various other constituents were obtained by inverting the LIMS radiance measurements. This same technique was used in 1981 to analyze the data returned from another limb scanning radiometer aboard the Solar Mesosphere Explorer...|$|R
