5|$|Gaudí complemented this organic {{vision of}} {{architecture}} {{with a unique}} spatial vision {{that allowed him to}} conceive his designs in three dimensions, unlike the flat design of traditional architecture. He used to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> acquired this spatial sense as a boy by looking at the drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced. Because of this spatial conception, Gaudí always preferred to work with casts and scale models or even improvise on-site as a work progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works—in fact, only when required by authorities.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} the urge to {{identify}} scapegoats for the fire is {{the acceptance of the}} confession of a simple-minded French watchmaker named Robert Hubert, who claimed that he was an agent of the Pope and had started the Great Fire in Westminster. He later changed his story to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> started the fire at the bakery in Pudding Lane. Hubert was convicted, despite some misgivings about his fitness to plead, and hanged at Tyburn on 28 September 1666. After his death, it became apparent that he had been on board a ship in the North Sea, and had not arrived in London until two days after the fire started. These allegations that Catholics had started the fire were exploited as powerful political propaganda by opponents of pro-Catholic Charles II's court, mostly during the Popish Plot and the exclusion crisis later in his reign.|$|E
5|$|Government troops killed Jonas Savimbi on 22 February 2002, in Moxico province. UNITA Vice President António Dembo took over, but {{died from}} {{diabetes}} 12days later on 3 March, and Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba became UNITA's leader. After Savimbi's death, the government {{came to a}} crossroads over how to proceed. After initially indicating the counter-insurgency might continue, the government announced it would halt all military operations on 13 March. Military commanders for UNITA and the MPLA met in Cassamba and agreed to a cease-fire. However, Carlos Morgado, UNITA's spokesman in Portugal, said the UNITA's Portugal wing had been under the impression General Kamorteiro, the UNITA general who agreed to the ceasefire, had been captured {{more than a week}} earlier. Morgado did <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not heard from Angola since Savimbi's death. The military commanders signed a Memorandum of Understanding as an addendum to the Lusaka Protocol in Luena on 4 April, with Santos and Lukambo observing.|$|E

5|$|On 26 May 1943, Oliphant {{wrote to}} Appleton to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been {{considering}} {{the problem of}} electromagnetic isotope separation, and believed that he had devised a better method than Lawrence's, one which {{would result in a}} five to tenfold improvement in efficiency, and make it more practical to use the process in Britain. His proposal was reviewed by Akers, Chadwick, Peierls and Simon, who agreed that it was sound. While the majority of scientific opinion in Britain favoured the gaseous diffusion method, there was still a possibility that electromagnetic separation might be useful as a final stage in the enrichment process, taking uranium that had already been enriched to 50 per cent by the gaseous process, and enriching it to pure uranium-235. Accordingly, Oliphant was released from the radar project to work on Tube Alloys, conducting experiments on his method at the University of Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|Sources differ widely on {{the number}} of {{children}} Amin fathered; most <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> 30 to 45. Until 2003, Taban Amin (born 1955), Idi Amin's eldest son, was the leader of West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), a rebel group opposed to the government of Yoweri Museveni. In 2005, he was offered amnesty by Museveni, and in 2006, he was appointed Deputy Director General of the Internal Security Organisation. Another of Amin's sons, Haji Ali Amin, ran for election as Chairman (i.e. mayor) of Njeru Town Council in 2002 but was not elected. In early 2007, the award-winning film The Last King of Scotland prompted one of his sons, Jaffar Amin (born in 1967), to speak out in his father's defence. Jaffar Amin said he was writing a book to rehabilitate his father's reputation. Jaffar is the tenth of Amin's 40 official children by seven official wives.|$|E
5|$|After Victory Road, Cage befriended the {{new number}} one {{contender}} Sting on the July 27, 2006 episode of Impact!, by asking for forgiveness for doubting Sting's agenda by coming to TNA in January of that year. He {{went on to}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> asked Jim Cornette the week before if {{he could be in}} Sting's corner in his match with Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event, but had told him he needed Sting's approval. Sting accepted Cage's offer, with interviewer and occasional ring announcer Jeremy Borash announcing Sting's decision in a backstage segment on the August 3, 2006 episode of Impact!. On August 13, 2006, Cage was in Sting's corner at Hard Justice as he faced Jarrett, with Scott Steiner in his corner, for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. During the contest, Cage interfered to help Sting win numerous times, as did Steiner for Jarrett, until Cage turned on Sting by taking Jarrett's signature guitar and bashing it over his head—changing his character from a face to a heel. He then allowed Jarrett to pin Sting and retain the title.|$|E

25|$|On July 27, 2005, former Miami city {{commissioner}} Arthur Teele {{walked into the}} main lobby of the Heralds headquarters and phoned Herald columnist Jim DeFede (one of several telephone conversations that the two had had during the day) to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a package for DeFede. He then asked a security officer to tell his (Teele's) wife Stephanie that he loved her, before pulling out a gun and committing suicide. This happened the day the Miami New Times, a weekly newspaper, published salacious details of Teele's alleged affairs, including allegations {{that he had had}} sex and used cocaine with a transsexual prostitute.|$|E

25|$|Zamenhof {{would later}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{dreamed of a}} world {{language}} {{since he was a}} child. At first he considered a revival of Latin, but after learning it in school he decided it was too complicated to be a common means of international communication. When he learned English, he realised that verb conjugations were unnecessary, and that grammatical systems could be much simpler than he had expected. He still had the problem of memorising a large vocabulary, until he noticed two Russian signs labelled Швейцарская (švejtsarskaja, a porter's lodge – from швейцар švejtsar, a porter) and Кондитерская (konditerskaja, a confectioner's shop – from кондитер konditer, a confectioner). He then realised that a judicious use of affixes could greatly decrease the number of root words needed for communication. He chose to take his vocabulary from Romance and Germanic, the languages that were most widely taught in schools around the world and would therefore be recognisable to the largest number of people.|$|E
25|$|John Hales wrote {{a speech}} to give in the House of Commons in 1563; he was a {{partisan}} of the Earl of Hertford, in right of his wife, the former Lady Catherine Grey. It {{was related to the}} efforts of Lord John Grey, Lady Catherine Grey's uncle and guardian, who tried {{to make the case that}} she was the royal heir at an early point in Elizabeth's reign, incurring the Queen's wrath. This manuscript brought to bear on the question the old statute De natis ultra mare. It was influential in the following debate, but the interpretation of the statute became important. It also caused a furore, and allegations of a plot. Hales could only be brought to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> shown a draft to John Grey, William Fleetwood, the other member of parliament for the same borough, and John Foster, who had been one of the members for Hindon. Walter Haddon called Hales's arrest and the subsequent row the Tempestas Halesiana. What Hales was doing was quite complex, using legal arguments to rule out Scottish claimants, and also relying on research abroad by Robert Beale to reopen the matter of the Hertford marriage. Francis Newdigate, who had married Anne Seymour, Duchess of Somerset, was involved in the investigation, but was not imprisoned; Hales was. He spent a year in the Fleet Prison and the Tower of London, and for the rest of his life was under house arrest.|$|E

[...] Dewar pleaded [...] "not guilty to two charges of accepting and forwarding a letter subversive of discipline and contrary to King's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions". [...] Dewar had the opportunity of cross-examining Rear-Admiral Collard over the incident of the dance and the disembarkation. [...] Collard admitted to saying certain things but refused to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> used improper words and not in earshot of anyone other than the Captain.|$|E
500|$|By {{combining}} '70s style {{hard rock}} riffing with alternative rock, Audioslave created a distinctive sound. This mix {{was driven by}} Cornell's wide vocal range, Morello's innovative guitar solos and the robust rhythm section of Wilk and Commerford. Morello, although stating he [...] "never felt musically limited" [...] in Rage Against the Machine, did <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> [...] "a lot more scope to explore with Audioslave" [...] and a [...] "wider musical territory." [...] This meant that the instrumentalists {{had the opportunity to}} write slow and melodic songs, something they had not done before.|$|E
500|$|Callaway {{carefully}} chose actors when casting each role. He {{focused on}} maintaining the series as a [...] "character-driven plot", to always make [...] "what {{is going on}} with people's hearts and minds" [...] more important than special effects. Despite auditioning other actors to voice Hippocrates, Callway reprised the role from the pilot; he would later <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> difficulty with the medical and technical vocabulary required for the character. Like The X-Files and Stargate SG-1, the show was filmed in Vancouver to take advantage of lower production costs. A majority of the crew had worked on The X-Files. The executive producers were: Trey Callaway, Michael Katleman, Lee David Zlotoff, Joe Voci, and Scott Sanders. Jon Ehrlich composed the show's theme.|$|E

500|$|On November 19, 1998, Independent Counsel Starr {{testified before}} the House Judiciary Committee in {{connection}} with the Impeachment of Bill Clinton over charges related to the Lewinsky scandal. [...] Here, for the first time, Starr exonerated both President Clinton and the First Lady of complicity in the FBI files matter, saying [...] "while there are outstanding issues that we are attempting to resolve with respect to one individual [...] found no evidence that anyone higher [...] was in any way involved in ordering the files from the FBI. Second, we have found no evidence that information contained in the files of former officials was used for an improper purpose." [...] (Starr also chose this occasion to clear President Clinton in the Travelgate matter, and to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not committed impeachable wrongdoing in the Whitewater matter; Democrats on the committee immediately criticized Starr for withholding all these findings until after the 1998 Congressional elections.) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{ferocity of}} Shakur's raging vocals, as said by long-time {{collaborator}} and producer of [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] Johnny [...] "J", was entirely authentic. He explained that Shakur was initially fueled by his anger against Biggie and Bad Boy Records for {{the belief that}} they had a role in the November 30, 1994 ambush and attack on Shakur. He claimed that Biggie and his crew knew of his shooting and wanted him dead. Shakur used this fury, which Johnny [...] "J" [...] described as [...] "superhuman", to attack Biggie and other East Coast rappers. Johnny [...] "J" [...] also stated that he had never seen Shakur so angry and that the words he rapped were in no way an act, describing the recording process as the most [...] "hard-core he had ever done." [...] Although he was very happy with the work he had put into it and the resulting song, Johnny [...] "J" [...] went on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no desire to work on anything of that magnitude again.|$|E
500|$|After Congress named Manzanar a National Historic Site {{and gave}} the National Park Service the job of {{restoring}} the site in 1992, protests against its creation emerged. Letters flooded the National Park Service, demanding that Manzanar be portrayed as a guest housing center for the Japanese Americans. William Hastings, of Bishop, California, wrote to the National Park Service, saying that the portrayal of Manzanar as a concentration camp amounts to [...] "treason." [...] Protesters threatened to start dismissal campaigns against Bill Michael, {{a member of the}} Manzanar Advisory Commission who was the Director of the Eastern California Museum in Independence, California, and Superintendent Ross Hopkins, the National Park Service employee assigned to the site. They also threatened to destroy any buildings erected or restored at Manzanar. Further, Lillian Baker, and others in California, objected to the words, [...] "concentration camp" [...] on the California State historical marker, which has been hacked and stained, with the first [...] "C" [...] of [...] "concentration camp" [...] having been ground off.
