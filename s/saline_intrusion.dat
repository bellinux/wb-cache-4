40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{the process of}} <b>saline</b> water <b>intrusion</b> into the estuaries of Red rivers which is biggest river {{in the north of}} Vietnam and the most important surface fresh water resource provided to all socio-economic activities. Due to uneven distribution of rainfall, during dry season, water flow in the river is rather low. This situation combinated with the tidal magnitude of nearly 4 m causes salt water goes into the river mouths. The Mike model was used to assess the process of <b>saline</b> water <b>intrusion</b> into the river mouths. Field investigation data including salt concentration along the rivers at different times, water level and water discharges from upper reservoirs, tidal series and river cross section were utilized to calibration, testing and formulation of <b>saline</b> water <b>intrusion</b> with some scenarios of water released from reservoirs. The results indicate that distance of saline water intruded from river mouth depends on the estuary characteristics, discharges from upper reservoirs and tidal phases (low and high tides).

25|$|Human {{pressures}} on global freshwater systems are having dramatic effects. The freshwater cycle is another boundary significantly affected by climate change. Freshwater resources, such as lakes and aquifers, are usually renewable resources which naturally recharge (the term fossil water is sometimes {{used to describe}} aquifers which don't recharge). Overexploitation occurs if a water resource is mined or extracted {{at a rate that}} exceeds the recharge rate. Recharge usually comes from area streams, rivers and lakes. Forests enhance the recharge of aquifers in some locales, although generally forests are a major source of aquifer depletion. Depleted aquifers can become polluted with contaminants such as nitrates, or permanently damaged through subsidence or through <b>saline</b> <b>intrusion</b> from the ocean. This turns much of the world's underground water and lakes into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to oil. Though Hubbert's original analysis did not apply to renewable resources, their overexploitation can result in a Hubbert-like peak.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of the hydrogeological setup in coastal areas calls for the adoption of scientific groundwater management techniques.

Other {{studies have examined}} temporal DO variability within rivers and we build on this by examining variability between streams {{as a basis for}} regional-scale predictors of risk for DO stress. Diel DO variability in these streams was driven by: (1) photosynthesis by aquatic plants and community respiration which produced DO maxima in the afternoon and minima early morning (range, 0. 6 – 4. 7 g/m³) as a product of the solar cycle and (2) tidal variability as a product of the lunar cycle, including <b>saline</b> <b>intrusions</b> with variable DO concentrations plus a small residual effect on freshwater DO for low-velocity streams. The lowest DO concentrations were observed during March (early autumn) when water temperatures and macrophyte biomass were high. Spatial comparisons indicated that lowgradient tidal streams were at greater risk of DO depletions harmful to aquatic life. Tidal influence was stronger in low-gradient streams, which typically drain more developed catchments, have lower reaeration potential and offer conditions more suitable for aquatic plant proliferation. Combined, these characteristics supported a simple method based on the extent of low-gradient channel for identifying coastal streams at risk of DO depletion. High-risk streams can then be targeted for riparian planting, nutrient limits and water allocation controls to reduce potential ecological stress...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the {{definition}} of the hydrodynamic and hydrochemical features of the aquifer of the Follonica-Scarlino coastal plain (southern Tuscany, Italy), in order to obtain an adequate knowledge for its correct mathematical modelling. On the basis of lithostratigraphic data the location and geometry of water-bearing sandy gravels were defined, and the hydrogeological cross sections and isopach maps were drawn. From all these data, it results that the gross volume of the reservoir is 320 • 106 m 3 (of which 32 • 106 m 3 is estimated as the effective pore space) and the profitable area for the water exploitation is located in the central-southern sector of the plain. The measurements of the water level in wells allowed the reconstruction of piezometric surface for the observation period (semptember 2000 and january 2001); such a reconstrucion shows the strong influence of exploitation on the groundwater flow with the formation of large areas of negative hydraulic head which almost concide with the main well field. Furthermore, the results of pumping tests, which permitted to estimate average hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity of 1. 5 • 10 - 4 m/s and 2. 3 • 10 - 3 m 2 /s respectively, offer a first indication of the good comprehensive water yield of the aquifer.

In this paper, by using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model (MIKE 21) and SLR scenarios of 0. 5 m, 1 m and 2 m, the impacts of potential future SLR on the North Branch of the Changjiang River Estuary are evaluated by quantifying salinity changes in the dry season.

40|$|Nutrient {{concentrations}} {{increased in}} 2 lakes (Lake Alexandrina and Lake Albert) {{located at the}} downstream end of the Murray Darling Basin, Australia, {{as a result of}} water level drawdown and salinisation associated with a severe drought. Between January 2007 and March 2008 the salinity difference between the inlet and outlets (5 barrages) increased from 0. 9 to 21. 0 g L- 1, resulting primarily from seawater leakage through the barrages. Subsequently, in relatively sheltered areas upstream of the barrages, permanent salinity-derived density stratification developed, leading to the development of an anoxic hypolimnion. This seemingly favoured the regeneration of dissolved nutrients from the sediments, with standing stocks of ammonium and filterable reactive phosphorus increasing by 250 and 142 %, respectively. However, the source of leakage water through the barrages also contributed to the increase. While dissolved organic carbon concentrations also increased, this was a result of evapoconcentration because calculated standing stocks changed little during the study period. In the open water areas, vertical density stratification was not evident, but sediment resuspension seemed to increase during the drawdown. Total organic nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations were closely related to light attenuation, suggesting increased resuspension of particulate nutrients during the water level drawdown or increased assimilation of dissolved nutrients by phytoplankton. Overall, sediment resuspension seemed to have had a greater impact on nutrient concentrations in open water areas of Lake Alexandrina and Lake Albert, while <b>saline</b> <b>intrusions</b> were more significant in relatively sheltered areas located close to the lake outlets.
