The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the impact of the Good Behavior Game (GBG) in {{children with}} psychiatric disorders, and their teachers, in special education. Teachers were trained by licensed school consultants to implement positive behavior support strategies to elicit desired behavior in students. A total of 389 children and their 58 teachers at 11 schools for <b>special</b> <b>primary</b> <b>education</b> were included in the study. Using a cluster randomized controlled design, special education schools were assigned to an intervention condition or an education as usual condition. An increase in emotional and behavioral problems was found in the control group, whereas no change was seen in the intervention group, indicating a modest intervention effect. No effects were found on children’s relationships with teachers or peers. The GBG affected teachers’ sense of self-efficacy in engaging students in schoolwork, but no effects were found on teachers’ self-efficacy in classroom management or on teachers’ burnout symptoms. Thus, although children with psychiatric disorders and their teachers in special education can benefit from the GBG, given the partial effects and modest effect sizes, a longer duration program complemented with additional elements is recommended...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of a teacher-delivered intervention with online mathematics mini-games on special education students' multiplicative reasoning ability (multiplication and division). The games involved declarative, procedural, as well as conceptual knowledge of multiplicative relations, and were accompanied with teacher-led lessons and class discussions. A pretest–posttest control-group design was employed, with 81 students from five schools for <b>special</b> <b>primary</b> <b>education</b> (three experimental schools and two control schools). The intervention consisted of two 10 -week game periods in which a total of 16 mini-games were offered as part of the regular educational program for multiplicative reasoning. The control group students played non-multiplicative mini-games; for multiplicative reasoning, they followed their regular educational program without mini-games. In both groups, students' multiplicative reasoning ability significantly increased. Regarding declarative knowledge of multiplication facts, learning outcomes were significantly higher in the experimental group as compared with the control group. This finding indicates the usefulness of mini-games for enhancing special education students' mathematics fact knowledge. Learning outcomes on a test measuring procedural and conceptual knowledge of multiplicative reasoning did not differ between experimental and control group. For these learning outcomes, then, the mini-games intervention did not have added value but can still be considered a “safe” alternative approach...|$|E

The maze task of CBM is such a method. Teachers can easily evaluate the instruction using maze task data. However, researched has shown that teachers experience difficulties adjusting instruction based on data.

40|$|September 2014 {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of a new law proclaiming inclusive education for all Dutch children. The goal of inclusive education is to have education in which all children can develop optimal cognitive, social and emotional skills. Currently, the selection of the type of special education for children with a handicap and/or behavioral problems is based on the diagnosis of the developmental disabilities of the child. In inclusive education, the educational needs of the child constitute the starting point. Teachers favor these changes, but are afraid that the amount of children with behavioral problems in the classroom will increase. The principle of inclusive education will result in a different distribution of children with a behavioral problem in the three different types of education for children with educational needs: primary education, <b>special</b> <b>primary</b> <b>education</b> and specific needs education. Children with diagnosed ADHD will also be part of this redistribution. To be able to serve children with ADHD well, it is important to know what children with ADHD in special education programs need. This research aims to contribute to this by investigating the differences in psychosocial skills among children with ADHD in the three before mentioned types of education in Holland. The variables measured are: psychosocial skills, level of ADHD-symptoms, cognitive development, and family and demographic characteristics. The random sample consisted of 93 children aged 4 - 12 with (the presumption of) ADHD in the three types of education in Holland. The results show that the psychosocial skills of children with ADHD are good predictors of the three types of education the children with ADHD will get. The less well-developed the psychosocial skills are, the more specialized the level of special education is. The educational level of the wage-earner in the family en the gender of the child also are important predictors. What is striking, is that there is no difference in ADHD-symptoms between the three types of education. It is concluded from the research that inclusive education must focus on the psychosocial skills of children with ADHD and support the development of these skills in primary education to optimum achieve the goals of inclusive education...|$|E

40|$|Advocates of {{inclusive}} education {{argue that the}} social participation of students with special educational needs (SEN) increases by educating them together with typically developing peers. However, research indicates {{that this is not}} obvious for all students with SEN (Guralnick, Neville, Hammond, & Connor, 2007). Especially students with social emotional and behavioral difficulties (SEBD) are not automatically socially included in regular education. Sociometric data is commonly used in social inclusion studies, meaning that others such as peers often indicate if a student is accepted or not (Frostad & Pijl, 2007). When social participation is addressed the perspective of socially excluded students, including their experiences and preferred solutions, are often not taken into account. In order to effectively address the social participation of these students, with and without SEBD, their voices should be heard. The aim of the current study is to explore: 1) the experiences regarding social exclusion of students, with and without SEBD, in primary schools and 2) which solutions the students preferred in situations of social exclusion. In total 35 socially excluded students (age range 9 - 13 years) from grade 5 and 6, in regular primary education (N = 14) and <b>special</b> <b>primary</b> <b>education</b> (N = 21), were interviewed with an interview protocol to explore the experiences of social exclusion in play and victimization. To analyze the interviews a multi¬grounded theory approach was used to generate themes in the students’ experiences and their preferences to address social exclusion. The results show that students’ experiences with social exclusion often take place outside the classroom. The preferred solutions provided by the students cover a broad spectrum, with a main role for the teacher as initiator of the solutions. The results are discussed in light of need for further studies addressing students’ voices of all students, not only the students with SEN, the importance of including students’ insights when designing interventions that target the social participation of students in {{inclusive education}} and the need to shift the interventions from the classroom to skills outside the classroom on the playground.

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a three-year longitudinal research project set up to investigate the effectiveness of employing online mini-games for the learning of multiplication and division, including multiplicative fact knowledge (declarative knowledge), multiplicative operation skills (procedural knowledge), and insight in multiplicative number relations (conceptual knowledge). A large number of primary school students was followed from end Grade 1 to end Grade 4. The first study in this thesis examined the students’ initial multiplicative ability at the end of Grade 1, just before multiplication and division were formally introduced. It was found that the students could already solve quite some multiplicative problems (58 % correct). Especially problems involving equal groups and problems including pictures with countable objects were often solved correctly. Furthermore, students’ performance was influenced by parental education and by the mathematics textbook used. The second study was on the effects of multiplicative mini-games in Grade 2. A cluster randomized experiment was used, with four conditions: playing multiplicative mini-games at school, integrated in a lesson (E 1), playing multiplicative mini-games at home without attention at school (E 2), playing multiplicative mini-games at home with debriefing at school (E 3), and a control group (C) in which mini-games on other mathematics domains were played at school. Learning effects were investigated using a pre- and posttest including multiplicative operation skills and insight. When comparing each experimental condition to the control group, a marginally significant effect was found for the E 3 condition (p =. 07, d = 0. 23); for the other conditions no effects were found. The third study investigated the effects of the mini-games in both Grade 2 and Grade 3. Effects were examined on multiplicative fact knowledge, operation skills, and insight in multiplicative number relations. The games were found to be effective both in condition E 1 and E 3 in enhancing insight, and in condition E 3 also in enhancing operation skills (ds ranging from 0. 22 to 0. 35). In the E 2 condition the games were only effective for students with above-average prior mathematics ability. Time and effort spent on the games was in some cases, but not always, related to learning outcomes. Furthermore, in Grade 2 the games were more effective for boys than for girls. The fourth study examined the effectiveness of the mini-games in <b>special</b> <b>primary</b> <b>education</b> (Grade 2). Here, only the E 1 and C condition were included. It was found that the multiplicative mini-games positively affected students’ multiplicative fact knowledge as compared to the control group (d = 0. 39). For multiplicative operation skills and insight (measured with a combined test) there was no difference with the control group. The fifth study investigated the development of regular primary education students’ attitude towards mathematics, from end Grade 1 to end Grade 4. In accordance with earlier studies, mathematics attitude was found to decrease over the years. Girls had a more positive mathematics attitude than boys, and relations were found between mathematics attitude and mathematics achievement. Finally, time and effort spent on the mini-games was a significant, but weak, predictor of later mathematics attitude...|$|E
40|$|My thesis {{describes}} an exploratory process into a practitioners’ discourse on appropriate education. Chapter one: Appropriate Education {{is about the}} Dutch educational policy called Passend onderwijs. The chapter positions the appropriate education in national and international educational and ethical Discourses with a capital ‘D’ and discourses with a lower-case ‘d’. Chapter Two: My Exploring Voices starts with the autobiographical description of my extended educational career, leading initially to an exploration of appropriate education from a phenomenological approach. The chapter then describes my researcher’s shift from phenomenology to the narrative turn. Following reflective sculptor activities, the leading question became how to do justice to, and present the variety between and within, the practitioners’ voices. As a consequence the situational (Guillemin & Gilman, 2004), relational (Ellis, 2007) and perfomative ethics (Holman Jones, 2005) started {{to play a major}} role additional to prevailing procedural qualitative researchers’ ethics (Baarda, Goede & Teunissen, 2009; Clandinin, 2007; Cohen, Manion & Morrisson, 2000; Evers, 2007; Maso & Smaling, 1998). Alongside these auto-ethnographic-driven ethical considerations, from Bakhtin (1981) I tapped the idea of using a dialogue as a way of presenting the varieties within and between voices. Bakhtin (1984 b) taught me as an author to renounce my essential surplus of knowledge. Boje challenged me as author to construct a polylogue as an antinarrative to keep the polylogue out of the prison of required unity of coherence. The plot of my thesis is my substantiated justification of constructing a plotless polylogue as to do justice to the variety within and between practitioners’ voices I heard talking about appropriate education. Chapter Three: Exploring Voices Exploring Appropriate Education describes the methodological steps towards the construction of a polylogue and writing its text. It is about the collecting process of information: about the destructive process of the collected information into stories to resource the polylogue; about the temporarily emplotment (Boje, 2001) as a tool to grasp the number of stories and the subsequent fragmentation of the plots and their constituent stories; about creating five characters and distributing the fragmented plots amongst the five created characters; about constructing, enacting and recording a scenario; about the process of writing and polishing a polylogue text; and about weaving a play. Chapter Four: Voices Exploring Appropriate Education contains the polylogue described as a play. The characters are: Anne, administrator; Cees, volunteer and researcher; Joan, special educational needs coordinator at a primary school; Paul, <b>special</b> <b>primary</b> <b>education</b> school director; Rob, a janitor; and Rosemary, primary school teacher school. A glossary is added for the practitioners’ Dutch slang that I decided to leave untranslated in the English medium polylogue to emphasize the Dutch character of the appropriate education policy and its discourse. Chapter Five: Post Voices begins with my reflective review of the exploratory process from the perspective of Vygostky. I first reflect on my explorer’s role from the traditional Dutch Vygotskian approach concluding my prelude education voice resounded in my exploring voice. Reflecting on voices exploring appropriate education from Vygotsky’s socio-historical voice I conclude, referring to Lyotard (1998), that my small story on an appropriate education discourse adds an intrinsic and ongoing incoherence to the Dutch appropriate education Discourse (Gee, 2005). Reflecting on the zones of proximal appropriate education developments I conclude that the presentness (Morson, 1994) to the current appropriate education discourse is lacking. My final words are on my acceptance and the consequences of this omission...|$|E

40|$|The bachelors thesis {{centers on}} the first aid <b>education</b> at Practical <b>primary</b> school and <b>Special</b> <b>primary</b> school in Jindřichův Hradec. The choice of the topic was based on author?s {{interest}} in the field. For years, the author has been volunteering for Regional Association of the Czech Red Cross and also teaches lay first aid. Every person should have a command of how to provide first aid; it counts among elementary education. The issues of health science and first aid have already {{become part of the}} Framework <b>Education</b> Programme for <b>primary</b> <b>education</b> - an addendum that regulates the education of pupils with mild mental disabilities; and also of the Framework Education Programme for pupil <b>education</b> at <b>Special</b> <b>primary</b> school. To accomplish the research objectives, the author chose the strategy of qualitative research. To accomplish the research objectives, the author used the technique of semi-structured interview, observation, and content data analysis. The research sample comprised of the pupils and teachers from the Practical <b>primary</b> school and <b>Special</b> <b>primary</b> school in Jindřichův Hradec. The first objective was set to identify the form and range of first aid education at the Practical <b>primary</b> school and <b>Special</b> <b>primary</b> school in Jindřichův Hradec. The research has shown that the Practical <b>primary</b> school and <b>Special</b> <b>primary</b> school in Jindřichův Hradec pay attention to first aid education and they consider it to be {{an important part of the}} Framework Education Programme. It was observed that the first aid education appears to be part of a number of educational areas and that the pupils with special educational needs are familiarized with the first aid basics through practical training. The second objective was to elaborate a method "How to teach first aid" at the Practical <b>primary</b> school and <b>Special</b> <b>primary</b> school in Jindřichův Hradec. The third objective was to implement the method in the curriculum of the Practical <b>primary</b> school and <b>Special</b> <b>primary</b> school in Jindřichův Hradec and verify its functionality. Given the group of pupils with special educational needs, it is believed that the draft of the method of "How to teach first aid" was appropriate and it met the condition of functionality. Based on these outcomes of the qualitative research, two hypotheses were defined. The first hypothesis is as follows: The pupils of the Practical primary school in Jindřichův Hradec are able to complete a training of how to provide first aid in case of minor injuries but also in case of life-threatening states. The second hypothesis is as follows: The degree of mental retardation, or nature of motor disability in pupils of the <b>Special</b> <b>primary</b> school in Jindřichův Hradec has a negative impact on the ability to practically carry out the first aid. The outcomes of the bachelors thesis may be utilized by the teachers in first aid training at the Practical <b>primary</b> school and <b>Special</b> <b>primary</b> school in Jindřichův Hradec...|$|R
