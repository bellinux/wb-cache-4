2500|$|On 13 July 2011, {{according}} to a leaked telephone surveillance transcript, Berlusconi told his presumed blackmailer Valter Lavitola: [...] "The only thing they can <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> is that I screw around [...] Now they're spying on me, controlling my phone calls. I don't give a fuck. In a few months [...] I'll be leaving this shit country that makes me sick." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a February 1977 interview, Cosier {{admitted}} [...] "I've got {{doubts about}} my own ability. I'm not convinced I"m a test batsman yet. I've {{got a long way}} to go... At the moment I'm playing one good innings and then three bad ones. I don't know why. Maybe I need to relax myself more of perhaps it's got something to do with attitude. All I know is I'm trying to work on it... I've heard about the things they <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> outside the off stump and to an extent I go along with them... I admit I'm a bit overweight." ...|$|E
5000|$|Smith {{is a big}} spender. [...] Smith is soft on crime. [...] Everything Smith <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> is true.|$|R
60|$|And this {{finishes}} {{my part of}} the story, and Jill {{is going}} to tell the rest. But you needn't believe everything she <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{mind what}} he <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> so much, I've {{got used to}} it," [...] {{answered}} Nat sadly; [...] "but I hate to have him pitch into you." ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. I didn't {{know what}} you'd <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> to Harry if you knew.|$|E
60|$|MRS. JUNO [returning hastily] Really {{you must}} be more careful what you <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> Mr. Lunn.|$|E
60|$|Speaking about me. What did he say? What did he say? What did he <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>me?</b> Don't ask.|$|E
6000|$|... "What are you <b>saying</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> Miss Amory?" [...] {{said the}} guardsman, with a grin. [...] "If it's {{anything}} good, {{say it in}} English, for I don't understand French when it's spoke so devilish quick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never," [...] she said, smiling {{into his}} face, [...] "never under any {{circumstances}} believe anything anybody ever <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> I have to tell that to my friends, in order that I may keep them. Tell me, have you begun the country letters yet for Mr. Anderson?" ...|$|R
2500|$|There {{is nothing}} autobiographical or therapeutical about it, and I don’t think it <b>says</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>me</b> personally.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few words}} I told him what I wanted, stating that I wished to hear {{whatever}} the trio in the cabin had to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind wot he said," [...] grumbled the stationmaster. [...] "Only you {{be careful}} o' wot you <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> in the future, Ham Ludd, thet's all!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll be as impersonal as cold boiled potatoes. (Not that I shall {{ever be able}} to {{help you}} 'make the town worth while.') What do they <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>me?</b> Really. I want to know." ...|$|E
5000|$|But you’re really old. Surely, you can’t <b>say</b> that <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> I’m not old the way you’re old.|$|R
60|$|BLANCO [in a {{forensic}} manner] Sheriff: the Elder, though known {{to you and}} to all here as no brother of mine and the rottenest liar in this town, is speaking the truth {{for the first time in}} his life as far as what he <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> is concerned. As to the horse, I say nothing; except that it was the rottenest horse you ever tried to sell.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{call that}} stupid," [...] said Camilla. [...] "And yet, when they do, {{all the old}} maids say that the girls are flirting. I'll tell you one thing, Mr. Burgess. I don't care what any old maid <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> I always talk to people that I like, and {{if they choose to}} call me a flirt, they may. It's my opinion that still waters run the deepest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Caw! caw! caw!" [...] {{he chuckled}} hoarsely; [...] "what do I {{care what you}} <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>me?</b> But don't you get saucy, my pretty thrush, or your friends will miss you some fine morning, and never see you again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I care {{very much}} what those say whom I {{choose to live}} with me. Whatever Tifto might <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> would be quite {{indifferent}} to me, because we have nothing in common. But you and he are bound together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Colonel Lefroy; {{whatever}} {{you may have}} to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> will certainly not be prevented by my paying you money. Though {{you might be able to}} ruin me to-morrow I would not give you a dollar to save myself." ...|$|E
60|$|MR. CHAIRMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,--It seems a most {{difficult}} thing for any man to <b>say</b> anything <b>about</b> <b>me</b> that is not complimentary. I don't know what the charm is <b>about</b> <b>me</b> which {{makes it impossible for}} a person to say a harsh thing <b>about</b> <b>me</b> and <b>say</b> it heartily, as if he was glad to say it.|$|R
5|$|What Arafat <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> doesn't bother me. Not only he, {{but also}} {{a whole list of}} Arab and world {{politicians}} claim that I am an agent of the Zionists or the CIA. Others state that I am a mercenary of the French secret service and of the Soviet KGB. The latest rumor is that I am an agent of Khomeini. During a certain period they said we were spies for the Iraqi regime. Now they say that we are Syrian agents.... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate this man Abu Nidal. They wanted to find a weak point in his character. The result was zero.|$|R
5000|$|Letterman finally aired the censored {{routine in}} its {{entirety}} on January 30, 2009. Hicks's mother, Mary, was present {{in the studio and}} appeared on-camera as a guest. Letterman took responsibility for the original decision to remove Hicks's set from the 1993 show. [...] "It <b>says</b> more <b>about</b> <b>me</b> as a guy than it <b>says</b> <b>about</b> Bill," [...] he said, after the set aired, [...] "because there was absolutely nothing wrong with that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said Lilly at last, [...] "there's {{something}}. I agree, it's true {{what you}} <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> But there's {{a bit of}} something else. There's {{just a bit of}} something in me, I think, which ISN'T a man running into a pub for a drink--" ...|$|E
60|$|AMY. Machiavellian? You're {{the first}} person that's ever said that. I always thought I was very simple and straight-forward. People <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> that.... Ah, now I'm talking about myself. That was unscrupulous of you. But you shouldn't have {{told me about the}} trick if you wanted it to succeed.|$|E
60|$|Is it such pain to {{you when}} people say what they ought not to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>me?</b> But when do they say {{what they ought to}} say about anything? Nearly {{everything}} I have ever done or said is as much above the present level of public understanding as the Old Man is above the Waterhead.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it necessary? No; I {{will appear}} as usual, for if I were to wear any light dress people would <b>say</b> things <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> and I should {{seem to be}} rejoicing when I am solemn all the time. The party doesn't suit me a bit; but never mind, stay and help to finish me off." ...|$|R
6000|$|Christine {{advanced}} {{from the}} doorway toward the table; she had her hands closed upon what seemed trinkets, some of which glittered and dangled from them. She said, [...] "Will you go to him {{and tell him that}} this meddlesome minx, here, had no business to <b>say</b> anything <b>about</b> <b>me</b> to him, and you take it all back?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About Bastin's words I can guess," [...] {{she went}} on. [...] "But I ask again--what has Bickley been <b>saying</b> to you <b>about</b> <b>me?</b> Of the first part, let it be; {{tell me the}} rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have never}} {{disguised}} it from myself, {{and nobody has}} ever disguised it from me, that I am not a handsome dog. Even mother never thought me beautiful. She was no Gladys Cooper herself, but she never hesitated to criticize my appearance. In fact, I have yet to meet anyone who did. The first thing strangers <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> is, 'What an ugly dog!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Pen was {{too much}} pleased with his own {{thoughts}} to perceive the sadness of the friend who was complimenting him. [...] "Thank you, Warrington," [...] he said, [...] "thank you for your friendship to me, and--and what you <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> I have often thought I was a poet. I will be one--I think I am one, as you say so, though the world mayn't. Is it--is it the Ariadne in Naxos which you liked (I was only eighteen when I wrote it), or the Prize Poem?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You didn't frighten me," [...] she retorted, with a {{touch of}} fire. [...] "I'm not a silly seminary girl. I've taken care of myself for a long time now, and I've done it without being frightened. We were {{together}} two Sundays, and I'm sure I wasn't frightened of Bob, or you. It isn't that. I have no fears of taking care of myself, but the world insists on taking care of one as well. That's the trouble. It's what the world would have to <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> and my employer meeting regularly and riding in the hills on Sundays. It's funny, but it's so. I could ride with one of the clerks without remark, but with you--no." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we {{may as well}} adjourn. There {{is nothing}} else you wish to <b>say</b> to <b>me</b> <b>about</b> that enigmatic Scarlet Pimpernel of yours?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all, my dear, {{the warning}} {{may be all}} the better for me," [...] said Ermine, with a voice less steady than her words. [...] "It is not what, under the circumstances, I could think likely in the Colin whom I knew; but were it indeed so, then, Ailie, you had better <b>say</b> nothing <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> unless he found you out. We would get {{employment}} elsewhere." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 2005 {{issue of}} Guitar Player magazine, Malmsteen {{discussed}} his often-ridiculed behaviour, saying that, [...] "I've probably made more mistakes than anybody. But I don't dwell on them. I don't {{expect people to}} understand me, because I'm pretty complex, and I {{think outside the box}} with everything I do. I've always taken the untraveled path. Obviously, people have their opinions, but I can't get too wrapped up in that, because I know what I can do and I know what kind of person I am. And I have no control over what anybody <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> Back in Sweden I'm 'Mr Personality' in the tabloids, but obviously I can't take that seriously. I know in my heart that if I do the absolute best I can do, maybe ten years from now people may turn around and say 'he wasn't that bad'." ...|$|R
