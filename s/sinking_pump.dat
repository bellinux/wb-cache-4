In the AGH-UST Educational and Research Laboratory of Renewable Energy Sources and Energy Saving in Miękinia, shallow geothermal heat is utilized for heating. In the article, the seasonal efficiency of two geothermal heat pump systems are described during the 2014 / 2015 heating season, defined as the period between 1 st October 2014 and 30 th April 2015. The first system has 10. 9 kW heating capacity (according to European Standard EN 14511 B 0 W 35) and extracts heat from three vertical geothermal loops at a depth of 80 m each. During the heating season, tests warmed up the buffer to 40 °C. The second system has a 17. 03 kW heating capacity and extracts heat from three vertical geothermal loops at a depth of 100 m each, and the temperature of the buffer was 50 °C. During the entire heating season, the water temperatures of the buffers was constant. Seasonal performance factors were calculated, defined as the quotient of heat delivered by a heat pump to the system and the sum of electricity consumed by the compressor, source <b>pump,</b> <b>sink</b> <b>pump</b> and controller of heat pumps. The measurements and calculations give the following results: – The first system was supplied with 13 857 kWh/a of heat and consumed 3 388 kWh/a electricity. The SPF was 4. 09 and the average temperature of outlet water from heat pump was 40. 8 °C, and the average temperature of brine flows into the evaporator was 3. 7 °C; – The second system was supplied with 12 545 kWh/a of heat and consumed 3 874 kWh/a electricity. The SPF was 3. 24 and the average temperature of outlet water from heat pump was 51. 6 °C, and the average temperature of brine flows into the evaporator was 5. 3 °C. To summarize, the data shown above presents the real SPF of the two systems. It will be significant in helping to predict the SPF of objects which will be equipped with ground source heat pumps...|$|R

If mostly focusing on the temperature uniformity, we can recommend some optimal structures to design a stacked mini-channel heat sink...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to develop a}} micropump for integrated microchannel cooling systems. The severe pumping requirements of microchannel heat sinks and limited space availability have necessitated the development of compact pumping technologies. ^ A comprehensive review {{of the state of the}} art in microscale pumping technologies was conducted. The pumping technologies were evaluated to assess their suitability for microchannel heat <b>sinks.</b> The <b>pumping</b> requirements of the microchannel heat sinks were studied and a graphical method to assess the suitability of pumping techniques to microchannel heat sinks was developed. Further, microchannel dimensions were optimized for minimum pumping requirements. ^ Based on these studies, a novel micropump design especially suited for electronics cooling applications and capable of integration into microchannel heat sinks was proposed. The micropump is based on concepts of valveless nozzle-diffuser micropumping and induction electrohydrodynamics (EHD). A transient, three-dimensional model of the pump capable of solving coupled charge transport and Navier-Stokes equations was developed. The model was used to study the performance of the pump and analyze the effects of various parameters. Results from the model indicated variation in output power from EHD due to variation in the instantaneous bulk fluid velocity. A detailed investigation of the effect of instantaneous bulk fluid velocity on the efficiency of conversion of electrical power into fluidic power in EHD pumping devices was conducted. Steady-state and transient ion-drag pumps and attraction- and repulsion-type induction EHD pumps were considered. ^ The results of this study prompted changes in the design of the micropump to exploit the increased efficiency of EHD at high instantaneous bulk fluid velocities. This design was studied numerically and the flow rate achievable from the pump was predicted. A micropump based on repulsion-type induction EHD was fabricated using silicon micromachining techniques. The micropump was tested and the resulting fluid velocities were determined using microscale particle image velocimetry. The experimental fluid velocities agreed with the predicted values to within 30 %. The flow rate and heat transfer rate achievable from integration of pumps in microchannels and power input required is estimated. ...|$|R
40|$|Reducing {{primary energy}} {{consumption}} by utilizing heat recovery systems has become increasingly important in industry. In many sectors, heating and cooling is required at different temperature levels at the same time. For this purpose, heat pumps are highly attractive energy conversion devices. Heat pumps are widely used for refrigeration, air-conditioning, space heating, hot water production, heat upgrading, or waste heat recovery. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review the literature for mechanical driven heat pumps and refrigeration systems with focus on multi-temperature applications. Different design strategies are presented, including cycles with multi-stage compressors, (multiple) ejectors, expansion valves, cascades (with secondary loops), and separated gas coolers. This review highlights the major advantages, challenges, and industrial applications of each multi-temperature heat pump cycle family. Schematics and pressure-enthalpy diagrams illustrate the most promising cycles. The performance of the cycles is compared in terms of First Law efficiency (COP) and Second Law efficiency (exergy) using simplified thermodynamic simulations. The literature reveals that the major part (approximately 70 %) of multi-temperature heat pump applications are found in refrigeration, i. e. supermarket food cooling, household fridges/freezers, and cooling/air-conditioning/storage during transportation. In contrast, studies on multi-temperature heating applications are rather rare with the exception of space floor heating and hot water production. Most multi-temperature cycle designs use two heat sources or two heat <b>sinks.</b> Heat <b>pumps</b> with more than three stages are not common, except for natural gas liquefaction. In supermarket applications, multiple compressors with transcritical CO 2 are an established key technology. Cascades with secondary loops are another frequently applied system, mostly in the USA. Cycles with multiple ejectors are ready to market and seem to be a promising modification for system performance improvement. Ejector cycles in refrigeration and air-conditioning systems are still under development. Expansion valve cycles are an established technology in household refrigeration. Separated gas coolers for space and hot water heating have recently attracted attention due to the possible combination with supercritical CO 2 cycles. Overall, this review paper serves to select the most appropriate multi-temperature heat pump cycle for a specific application...|$|R

Results gained with the optimization tool are generalized and optimum configurations are illustrated on design charts. Physical trends are illustrated analytically using the underlying relations. Investigations are done for air and water in single-phase flow with no phase transition; with hydraulic diameters of the micro-channels ranging from about 1 micron to 80 mm. Optimization is shown to have a tremendous effect. It can reduce pump power by several orders of magnitude, especially for high heat flux devices. Using water and air as coolants, designs for heat fluxes of> 10 kW/cm 2 and> 100 W/cm 2 respectively with pump/fan power expenses less than 1 % are easily found with the optimization tool. It appears that large aspect ratios for the flow channels are favorable for high heat fluxes in micro heat sinks.

This is most important and gratifying news. The journey from Sooro to Rayray Guddy, thirty miles, without water, was the trying part of the journey forward, and if the animals could speak not a few of them would lay their illnesses to that long and distressing journey. It is true that there was generally a little water to be had at the old well, but this was so deep and so difficult to get at, that, although a party of three or four animals could be watered there, it was quite impossible that a largo convoy could be watered. Now a large dépôt of provisions and forage will be established there, and the journey will henceforth be divided into five day’s marches, of nearly equal length. Fresh animals arrive here every day, and the amount of stores of every description which is poured on shore is really surprising. Nothing could work better or more evenly than do all the departments here. There is no confusion of any sort, and the issue of rations and stores, and the general arrangements, work as smoothly as at Aldershot. The military bands play morning and evening, and all is as quiet and according to rule as if we had been six months and intended to stay six months more upon this plain, twenty-four hours’ sojourn upon which was declared by our prophets of evil to be fatal to a European. The only thing in which we differ from a stationary camp is that there are no parades. Everyone is at work upon fatigue-duty. Every available man is ordered off to some work or other, and as we have with pioneers, coolies, hired natives, and soldiers, four or five thousand men here, we really ought to make considerable progress with our railway, which is now the only work of importance, {{with the exception of the}} wooden commissariat jetty, and the never-ending task of receiving and landing stores. Up to three days ago there was a piece of work in progress which was a great joke in camp. I mentioned in a former letter that the commissariat stores having been flooded, the engineers built a dam which was intended to keep out the sea, but which on the first heavy rain kept in the water and caused a fresh-water flood instead of a salt one. Colonel Wilkins then resolved upon a work on a large scale; on so large a scale, indeed, that there were reports through the camp that “he had determined on raising the whole African coast three feet,” while others more moderate denied the exactness of this, and said that he was merely “seized with a desire to show the Bombay people how reclamations from the sea ought to be carried out.” The last report was nearer to the truth than the first, for his intention was to raise the shore from one jetty to another, a distance of about 400 yards, the shore to be raised being thirty or forty yards in width, and needing three feet of additional height at the very least. The material to be used was sand. Accordingly, about a thousand men worked for a week with baskets at what their officers called mudlarking, and had not the sea fortunately interposed, they might have worked for another six months longer, with the certain result that the very first time a high tide, accompanied by wind, set in the work would altogether disappear; sand having—as most children who have built castles upon the Ramsgate sands are perfectly aware—an awkward knack of melting away when beaten upon by the sea. Fortunately, before more was done than making a sort of bank next to the sea, and when the labour of filling the whole shore behind this to the same level began to be apparent even to the most obstinate, the sea rose, came over the dam, covered the low ground behind three feet deep, entered the commissariat stores, and, as it could not escape, did considerably more damage than it would have done had the shore remained as it was before the labour of a thousand men for a week was expended upon it.|$|R

40|$|Ground-coupled {{heat pumps}} (GCHP) have {{garnered}} considerable attention {{in recent years}} as an energy-saving alternative to conventional space heating and cooling systems, but there exists some debate about their effectiveness and efficiency. Some of this debate stems from the inherent complexity of the subsurface heat transfer problem; the rate of subsurface heat transfer ultimately drives GCHP system performance. A given GCHP site may have many geologically distinct layers of soil and rock?each with its own macro-scale thermal properties?which complicates the prediction of heat transfer. Even within a given layer, there exists variability in its properties due to depositional processes, weathering, and fracturing. This work opens with an introduction that prefaces the study and fundamentals of GCHPs, with particular attention paid to the interaction between site geology and heat transfer within the system (Chapter 1). The general concept of using heat pumps for heating and cooling is discussed, and some of the tools for GCHP design, like thermal response tests (TRTs), are briefly explained. The background (Chapter 2) introduces distributed temperature sensing (DTS), the history of its development, and the methods behind its use. The first paper presented in this thesis (Chapter 3) is a two-part study, the first focusing on recording thermal properties of specific lithofacies in a particular region (Wisconsin, USA), and the second part modeling how these measurements could change expected GCHP design and performance in a typical residential setting. Representative sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks from Wisconsin were characterized in previous work by Meyer (2013) using guarded-comparative-longitudinal heat flow experiments (ASTM E 1225), calorimetry, and weight-volume assessments. The model was developed by coupling the rate of heat extraction in a heat pump to an analytical model of heat transfer through a pipe with constant wall temperature. The constant-wall temperature used in the pipe model was taken from an implementation of the infinite line source (ILS) model. This strategy allows the modeled heat extraction rate to be limited by the characteristics of the pipe, which is an advantage over using the ILS model on its own. However, coupling ILS to pipe conduction is still a major simplification in modeling subsurface heat transfer. The indexed thermophysical values from Meyer (2013) and supplemental laboratory measurements were used to construct a hypothetical vertical heat exchange loop penetrating vertically consecutive Paleozoic strata. The hypothetical loop was examined using the rate of system temperature drop under full load as a measure of performance during the heating season. Expected system performance was compared between commonly cited thermal conductivity values of their general lithologies (e. g., sandstone, dolomite, shale) and the laboratory-measured thermal properties of the specific formations. Thermal conductivity indexed by general lithology proved to be insufficient as a design parameter to generate accurate assessments of GSHP performance. The second paper of this study (Chapter 4) and its appendix (Appendix 1) describe the design and implementation of distributed temperature sensing (DTS) as a method of evaluating subsurface heat transfer. DTS is a measuring technique that utilizes fiber-optic cable to measure temperature along continuous profiles. DTS fibers were deployed permanently in an instrumented GCHP system at a residence located in Grand Marsh, Wisconsin, USA. The site was originally intended to be a test location for an unconventionally deep borehole described in Meyer (2013), but was instead converted to a more traditional system with three vertical ground heat exchangers (GHEs) of ~ 100 m depth each. However, the system was atypical in a number of ways. Air conditioning, space heating, and domestic hot water were supplied by a pair of heat pumps sharing the same GHE loop. A manifold separately controlling flow to each of the GHEs was constructed to allow the flow circuit to be configured as parallel, series, or single-GHE. Temperature, flow rate, and power sensors were installed on components of the heat pump system in a plan similar to that described in the appendix of Meyer (2013). This allowed the system?s coefficient of performance (COP) to be measured along with weather conditions on the site. The dataloggers collecting these measurements were connected to network-connected laptops for remote monitoring and configuration. Though monitoring on the site is in the early stages, daily COP observations were made and related to the electrical power consumption of the heat pumps and the weather conditions {{during the first half of}} the 2014 - 2015 heating season. The daily COP was correlated with which of the two heat pumps delivered the majority of heating to the residence on that day. The water-to-air heat pump was the more efficient of the two, so higher proportional use of the water-to-air heat pump was correlated positively to the daily COP. Heating COP was also positively correlated to the entering water temperature (EWT). This outcome was expected because the Carnot efficiency (i. e., the theoretical maximum efficiency for any heat pump or heat engine) is directly related to the temperature difference between the heat source and heat <b>sink.</b> Heat <b>pump</b> usage, as indicated by their electrical power consumption, was correlated with drops in outdoor temperature. Representative temperature profiles within the system?s GHEs were acquired with the DTS system during seasons with different space conditioning requirements. The profiles, which were taken in January of 2014, indicated that heat recovery was lower than desired. The 2013 - 2014 heating season was colder than normal, with 223 more heating degree days (Celsius) during the Dec-January time period than average for the central Wisconsin region (Wisconsin Department of Administration). The profiles also showed that heat transfer in the horizontal trenches leading to the GHEs was limited at best, and, during extreme conditions, the direction of heat flux within the trenches could be reversed, likely due to the depressed temperature at the trench?s shallow depth (2 m). Summer profiles showed that heat was easily transferred to the subsurface, due in part to relatively cool ambient temperatures underground (< 12 ?C) and heat already extracted during the preceding heating season. The final component of this research was the installation of a DTS network at a large heat exchange borefield in Verona, Wisconsin, USA. Described in Appendix 1, this effort has already produced background DTS measurements and will begin to record the effect of activating a portion of the borefield of over 2500 150 -m-deep GHEs early in 2015. The DTS array at this borefield features eight double-ended loops of fiber optic cable connecting 13 boreholes, each with a depth of 150 m. The total length of DTS fiber at this system will surpass 10 km...|$|R
