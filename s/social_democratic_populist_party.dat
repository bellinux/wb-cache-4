5000|$|<b>Democratic</b> and <b>Populist</b> <b>party</b> {{candidate}} William Jennings Bryan ran on {{the platform}} of [...] "free silver," [...] in which he implored Americans to drop the gold standard and reinstate the coinage of silver in order to inflate the American economy. Bryan was an orator who gave many speeches on the issue, with the most famous being his [...] "Cross of Gold" [...] speech of July 9, 1896. In this speech, Bryan laid out his belief {{that the existence of}} multiple forms of legal tender was necessary for the health of the national economy, as farmers would benefit from being able to sell their crops at a higher price. Bryan became both the <b>Democratic</b> and <b>Populist</b> <b>party</b> nominee due in part to his stances on the issues of the gold standard, which he believed could alleviate the Panic of 1896. Bryan was a dark horse candidate prior to his Cross of Gold speech, but his intense rhetoric resonated among many Americans that felt that a second, less valuable, form of legal tender was necessary for less wealthy Americans, and he quickly became the front-runner of both the <b>Populist</b> and <b>Democratic</b> <b>parties.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{the death}} in office of President Turgut Özal (which {{according}} to some {{was part of the}} 1993 alleged Turkish military coup), DYP Prime Minister Süleyman Demirel won the 1993 presidential election on 16 May 1993. Suddenly the important position as Prime Minister and leader of the DYP was vacant. The party found itself in an identity crisis. Ciller was no obvious candidate, but the three male contenders could not muster the resources, skill and support to compete effectively. Ciller was a professional urban woman, young and smart with a Western higher education. The media supported her, as well as the business community, and externally she gave the impression that Turkey was a progressive Muslim country. On 13 June 47-year-old Çiller fell 11 votes shy of a majority in the first ballot for party leader. Her opponents withdrew and she became the party's leader and on 25 June, the Prime Minister of the DYP-Social <b>Democratic</b> <b>Populist</b> <b>Party</b> (SHP) coalition government (50th government of Turkey).|$|R

50|$|Turkey's 13th general {{election}} {{was held on}} Sunday December 24, 1995, triggered by the newly re-established Republican People's Party's (CHP) withdrawal from a coalition with the True Path Party (DYP). The coalition had been in government for four years, having been formed by the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Populist</b> <b>Party,</b> the CHP's predecessor.|$|E

The youngest member of the House, Porter served two terms (from 1896 to 1900).|$|R
2500|$|The term [...] "socialist" [...] {{has long}} been used as an epithet by conservatives that goes far beyond issues of {{municipal}} [...] ownership. [...] Editor William Allen White of Emporia, Kansas, in his famous 1896 editorial on [...] "What's the matter with Kansas" [...] furiously attacked the radicalism of Bryanite Democrats and Populists. Supporters of Republican conservative William McKinley distributed over a million copies to rally opposition to William Jennings Bryan, nominee of both the <b>Democratic</b> and <b>Populist</b> <b>parties.</b> White, according to historian David Hinshaw, used [...] "socialistic" [...] as [...] "his big gun to blast radical opposition." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} McKinley's victory over William Jennings Bryan, both the <b>Democratic</b> and <b>Populist</b> <b>parties</b> gained seats from McKinley's Republican Party. This {{is most likely}} a {{reaction}} to the extraordinary Republican gains in 1894, in which many normally Democratic districts switched parties due to the severity of and fallout from the Panic of 1893. Many Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern regions that were dominated by Catholic and working-class voters, switched to Republican in 1894, but returned to the Democratic Party during this election cycle. The <b>Populist</b> <b>Party</b> also made huge gains as Republicans were ousted in Western states. Despite this, the Republicans did maintain a strong majority in the House. Also, several Western Republicans split with the party in 1896, forming the tiny Silver Republican Party faction, which advocated a silver standard.|$|R
50|$|The ban on pre-1980 {{politicians}} {{was lifted}} in 1987 and on pre-1980 parties was lifted in 1992. Both of these normalization steps were {{largely due to}} Erdal İnönü's efforts. He also tried to unify the three parties; SODEP and HP merged in 1985 to form the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Populist</b> <b>Party</b> (SHP), but DSP remained apart.|$|E

25|$|Racial {{violence}} continued {{by whites}} against blacks as they enforced white supremacy. Despite this, freedmen pursued education, organize new churches and fraternal organizations, and entered politics, winning local offices. By the 1890s, more than 100,000 blacks were voting in state elections. In 1896 and 1898, Republican Robert B. Hawley {{was elected to}} Congress from the state by a plurality, when most white voters split between the <b>Democratic</b> and <b>Populist</b> <b>parties.</b> Democrats were determined to end competition by Republicans and Populists, and reviewed what other Southern states were doing to disenfranchise blacks and poor whites. Mississippi's new constitution of 1890 had survived a Supreme Court case, although in practice it was highly discriminatory against freedmen.|$|R
50|$|Rather than {{practicing}} law, Lane {{moved to}} New York City {{to continue his}} newspaper career as {{a correspondent for the}} Chronicle. There he became a protégé of the reformer Henry George and a member of New York's Reform Club. He returned to the West Coast in 1891 as editor and part owner of the Tacoma News. He was successful in driving a corrupt chief of police into exile in Alaska, but the business venture as a whole was unsuccessful, and the paper declared bankruptcy in 1894, a victim of the poor economy and Lane's espousal of <b>Democratic</b> and <b>Populist</b> <b>Party</b> causes. In 1893, Lane married Anne Wintermute; they had two children, Franklin Knight Lane, Jr. and Nancy Lane Kauffman.|$|R
