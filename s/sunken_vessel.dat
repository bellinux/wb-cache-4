5|$|Berkshire No. 7 is a {{wood and}} steel barge {{constructed}} in 1935. It is historically {{important as a}} transitional canal barge and {{as one of the}} few surviving wooden-hulled canal boats. It was used to transport bulk cargo, including shipping fertilizer, from Connecticut to Long Island Sound. It sank in 1974 along with the Elmer S. Dailey and the Priscilla Dailey in the harbor of Bridgeport, Connecticut on the west side of the Pequonnock River. The <b>sunken</b> <b>vessel</b> has deteriorated to the point that a salvage operation could result in breaking it apart. The Berkshire No. 7 was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 21, 1978.|$|E
5|$|Conservation of the {{propeller}} was completed {{nearly three years}} after its recovery and it is {{on display in the}} Monitor Center at the Mariners' Museum. As of 2013, conservation of the engine, its components, the turret and the guns continues. The Dahlgren guns were removed from the turret in September 2004 and placed in their own conservation tanks. Among some of the artifacts recovered from the <b>sunken</b> <b>vessel</b> was a red signal lantern, possibly the one used to send a distress signal to Rhode Island and the last thing to be seen before Monitor sank in 1862 – it was the first object recovered from the site in 1977. A gold wedding band was also recovered from the hand of the skeletal remains of one of Monitors crew members found in the turret.|$|E

25|$|Blown up by {{dynamite}} last night. It {{was intended}} to have fired the charges at 5 o'clock in the evening; but at that hour the <b>sunken</b> <b>vessel</b> was so thickly surrounded by boats, it was deemed inexpedient {{to proceed with the}} work, and 9 o'clock was decided upon. The knowledge that large numbers of fish would be thrown to the surface stunned by the shock influenced the attendance of small boats to a marked degree in the afternoon, and though there were not nearly so many at night the number was larger than was expected, and caution had to be observed.|$|E
25|$|During World War II {{the wreck}} of the vessel was used as a target by Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) bomber pilots from the nearby Garbutt Airfield. On 22 October 1942, six RAAF Bristol Beaufort bombers of 100 Squadron were {{participating}} in a coordinated mock torpedo attack on Townsville Harbour followed by a coordinated practice bombing of the wreck. Following a successful mock attack on Townsville Harbour, the six bombers climbed to approximately 1,000feet (305 meters) and proceeded in a vee formation towards Cockle Bay. Several of the aircraft dived upon the wreck in a bombing run, during which one of the aircraft appeared to strike one of the masts of the <b>sunken</b> <b>vessel,</b> before crashing into the shallow ocean waters approximately 700 meters &765 yards) from the vessel. The plane′s fuselage disintegrated on impact instantly killing three RAAF officers and a United States Navy officer aboard the bomber.|$|E

500|$|In 1977, {{scientists}} were {{finally able to}} view the wreckage in person as the submersible Johnson Sea Link was used to inspect it. The Sea Link was able to ferry divers down to the <b>sunken</b> <b>vessel</b> and retrieve small artifacts. U.S. Navy interest in raising the entire ship ended in 1978 when Captain Willard F. Searle Jr. calculated the cost and possible damage expected from the operation: $20million to stabilize the vessel in place, or as much as $50million to bring all {{of it to the}} surface. Research continued and artifacts continued to be recovered, including the ship's [...] anchor in 1983. The growing number of relics required conservation and a proper home so the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in charge of all U.S. marine sanctuaries, selected the Mariners' Museum on 9 March 1987 after considering proposals from several other institutions.|$|E

However, these fishes are susceptible to heavy fishing pressure and a conflict exists between fishers who would like to harvest its resources and Eco tourists who prefer to observe and photograph these fishes. Fishing on these artificial reefs can rapidly reduce target fish populations and negatively impact local fisheries.
