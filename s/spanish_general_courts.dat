5000|$|Doing {{away with}} the Spanish {{autonomic}} state. UPyD wants Spain to adopt a system of symmetric federalism with broad political centralization as a territorial model, clearly defining in the Constitution which powers are exclusive of the State and which ones are transferable to autonomous communities or municipalities. The party wants to centralize competences that concern citizens' fundamental rights like education, health and justice among others because the State of Autonomies, besides creating nationwide inequalities, {{is considered to be}} [...] "elephantine, politically unviable and economically unsustainable". Another aspect of UPyD's symmetric federalism is the abolition of Navarre's and the Basque Country's chartered regimes, establishing a common system of funding for all autonomous communities. Other noteworthy proposals are municipal mergers so that municipalities have a minimum dimension of 20,000 inhabitants, the suppression of the provincial councils (diputaciones provinciales), chartered councils (diputaciones forales), Basque General Assemblies (Juntas Generales vascas) and district councils (comarcas), and the unicameralism of the <b>Spanish</b> <b>General</b> <b>Courts</b> after eliminating the Senate.|$|E
