5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E
5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in arc welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds. Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Square</b> <b>waves</b> are universally {{encountered}} in digital switching circuits and are naturally generated by binary (two-level) logic devices. They {{are used as}} timing references or [...] "clock signals", because their fast transitions are suitable for triggering synchronous logic circuits at precisely determined intervals. However, as the frequency-domain graph shows, <b>square</b> <b>waves</b> contain {{a wide range of}} harmonics; these can generate electromagnetic radiation or pulses of current that interfere with other nearby circuits, causing noise or errors. To avoid this problem in very sensitive circuits such as precision analog-to-digital converters, sine waves are used instead of <b>square</b> <b>waves</b> as timing references.|$|R
25|$|The Fourier {{transform}} of the <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> {{generates a}} frequency spectrum that presents {{the magnitude of}} the harmonics that make up the <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> (the phase is also generated, but is typically of less concern and therefore is often not plotted). The Fourier transform {{can also be used to}} analyze non-periodic functions such as transients (e.g. impulses) and random functions. The Fourier transform is almost always computed using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) computer algorithm in combination with a window function.|$|E

The values of the spring and mass give a natural frequency of 7nbsp&Hz for this specific system. Applying the 1nbsp&Hz <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> from earlier allows the calculation of the predicted vibration of the mass. The figure illustrates the resulting vibration. It happens in this example that the fourth harmonic of the <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> falls at 7nbsp&Hz. The frequency response of the massndash&springndash&damper therefore outputs a high 7nbsp&Hz vibration even though the input force had a relatively low 7nbsp&Hz harmonic. This example highlights that the resulting vibration is dependent on both the forcing function and the system that the force is applied to.|$|E

Based on methods for signals with finite rate of innovation (FRI), generalized Analog Thresholding (gAT-n) {{is able to}} sample <b>square</b> <b>waves</b> {{at a much lower}} rate under ideal conditions. The target application is efficient, real-time, implantable neurotechnology that extracts spiking neural signals from the brain. This paper studies the effect of integrator noise and quantization error on the accuracy of reconstructed <b>square</b> <b>waves.</b> We explore realistic values for integrator noise and input signal amplitude, using specifications from the Texas Instruments IVC 102 integrator chip as a first-pass example because of its readily-available data sheet. ADC resolution is varied from 1 to 16 bits. This analysis indicates that gAT- 1 is robust against these hardware non-idealities where gAT- 2 degrades less gracefully, which makes gAT- 1 a prime target for hardware implementation in a custom integrated circuit...|$|R
25|$|Digital {{electronics}} {{were applied}} to fluoroscopy {{beginning in the early}} 1960s, when Frederick G. Weighart and James F. McNulty (1929-2014) at Automation Industries, Inc., then, in El Segundo, California produced on a fluoroscope the world’s first image to be digitally generated in real-time, while developing a later commercialized portable apparatus for the onboard nondestructive testing of naval aircraft. <b>Square</b> <b>wave</b> signals were detected on a fluorescent screen to create the image.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the wide}} slew range and lack of {{positive}} feedback, the response of all the open-loop level detectors described above will be relatively slow. External overall positive feedback may be applied, but (unlike internal positive feedback that may be applied within the latter stages of a purpose-designed comparator) this markedly affects {{the accuracy of the}} zero-crossing detection point. Using a general-purpose op-amp, for example, the frequency of Ei for the sine to <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> converter should probably be below 100Hz.|$|E
25|$|A {{waveform}} generator {{is a fundamental}} module in a sound synthesis system. A {{waveform generator}} usually produces a basic geometrical waveform with a fixed or variable timbre and variable pitch. Common waveform generator configurations usually included two or three simple waveforms and often a single pseudo-random-noise generator (PRNG). Available waveforms often included pulse wave (whose timbre can be varied by modifying the duty cycle), <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> (a symmetrical pulse wave producing only odd overtones), triangle wave (which has a fixed timbre containing only odd harmonics, but is softer than a <b>square</b> <b>wave),</b> and sawtooth wave (which has a bright raspy timbre and contains odd and even harmonics). Two notable examples of systems employing this technology comprise the Nintendo Game Boy portable game console, and the Commodore 64 personal computer. The Game Boy uses two pulse channels (switchable between 12.5%, 25%, 50% and 75% wave duty cycle), a channel for 4-bit PCM playback, and a pseudo-random-noise generator. The Commodore 64, however, used the MOS Technology SID chip which offered 3 channels, each switchable between pulse, saw-tooth, triangle, and noise. Unlike the Game Boy, the pulse channels on the Commodore 64 allowed full control over wave duty cycles. The SID was a very technically advanced chip, offering many other features including ring modulation and adjustable resonance filters.|$|E

25|$|In a {{previous}} section only a simple harmonic force {{was applied to}} the model, but this can be extended considerably using two powerful mathematical tools. The first is the Fourier transform that takes a signal as a function of time (time domain) and breaks it down into its harmonic components as a function of frequency (frequency domain). For example, by applying a force to the massndash&springndash&damper model that repeats the following cycle – a force equal to 1nbsp&newton for 0.5nbsp&second and then no force for 0.5nbsp&second. This type of force has the shape of a 1nbsp&Hz <b>square</b> <b>wave.</b>|$|E
25|$|From {{a signal}} {{processing}} point of view, the Gibbs phenomenon is the step response of a low-pass filter, and the oscillations are called ringing or ringing artifacts. Truncating the Fourier transform of a signal {{on the real}} line, or the Fourier series of a periodic signal (equivalently, a signal on the circle) corresponds to filtering out the higher frequencies by an ideal (brick-wall) low-pass/high-cut filter. This can be represented as convolution of the original signal with the impulse response of the filter (also known as the kernel), which is the sinc function. Thus the Gibbs phenomenon {{can be seen as}} the result of convolving a Heaviside step function (if periodicity is not required) or a <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> (if periodic) with a sinc function: the oscillations in the sinc function cause the ripples in the output.|$|E
25|$|While current {{technology}} is very effective at detecting smoke and fire conditions, the deaf and {{hard of hearing}} community has raised concerns {{about the effectiveness of}} the alerting function in awakening sleeping individuals in certain high-risk groups such as the elderly, those with hearing loss and those who are intoxicated. Between 2005 and 2007 research sponsored by the United States' National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) focused on understanding the cause of the higher number of deaths in such high-risk groups. Initial research into the effectiveness of the various alerting methods is sparse. Research findings suggest that a low frequency (520Hz) <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> output is significantly more effective at awakening high risk individuals. Wireless smoke and carbon monoxide detectors linked to alert mechanisms such as vibrating pillow pads for the hearing impaired, strobes, and remote warning handsets are more effective at waking people with serious hearing loss than other alarms.|$|E
