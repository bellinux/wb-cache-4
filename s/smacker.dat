Along the campaign, shorter pieces of CGI encoded in RAD Game Tools's <b>Smacker</b> video format would be shown within missions as cutscenes. These sometimes provided clues to solving some problematic aspect of the current mission. Simple CGI animations utilising wire frame models were used in mission briefings.|$|E
6000|$|The drawing-room {{contained}} several {{pictures of}} Mrs. Sherrick {{when she was}} in the theatrical line; Smee's portrait of her, which was never half handsome enough--for my Betsy, Sherrick said indignantly; the print of her in Artaxerxes, with her signature as Elizabeth Folthorpe (not in truth a fine specimen of calligraphy) the testimonial presented to her on the conclusion of the triumphal season of 18--, at Drury Lane, by her ever grateful friend Adolphus <b>Smacker,</b> Lessee, who, of course, went to law with her next year; and other Thespian emblems. But Clive remarked, with not a little amusement, that the drawing-room tables were now covered with a number of those books which he had seen at Madame de Moncontour's, and many French and German ecclesiastical gimcracks, such as are familiar to numberless readers of mine. These were the Lives of St. Botibol of Islington and St. Willibald of Bareacres, with pictures of those confessors. Then there was the Legend of Margery Dawe, Virgin and Martyr, with a sweet double frontispiece, representing (1) the sainted woman selling her feather-bed for the benefit of the poor; and (2) reclining upon straw, the leanest of invalids. There was Old Daddy Longlegs, and how he was brought to say his Prayers; a Tale for Children, by a Lady, with a preface dated St. Chad's Eve, and signed [...] "C. H." [...] The Rev. Charles Honeyman's Sermons, delivered at Lady Whittlesea's Chapel. Poems of Early Days, by Charles Honeyman, A.M. The Life of good Dame Whittlesea, by do, do. Yes, Charles had come out in the literary line; and there in a basket was a strip of Berlin work, of the very same Gothic pattern which Madame de Moncontour was weaving; and which you afterwards saw round the pulpit of Charles's chapel. Rosey was welcomed most kindly by the kind ladies; and as the gentlemen sat over their wine after dinner in the summer evening, Clive beheld Rosey and Julia pacing up and down the lawn, Miss Julia's arm around her little friend's waist: he thought they would make a pretty little picture.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Smacker</b> {{video is}} a video file format (with the [...]SMK file extension) {{developed}} by RAD Game Tools, and primarily used for full-motion video in video games. <b>Smacker</b> uses an adaptive 8-bit RGB palette.

5000|$|<b>Smacker</b> video {{supports}} 256 colors, {{and includes}} transparency support. While being a palette-based format, which is inherently limited to having {{not more than}} 256 colors in each frame, <b>Smacker</b> videos may still contain more colors in total due to [...] "palette rotation", whereby the palette is updated on a per-frame basis. This usually results in SMK files that look better if the source video has more than 256 colors. The compression rate of <b>Smacker</b> can reach 1:12, but {{at the loss of}} quality (pixelation).|$|E

500|$|Despite these achievements, Jack grew {{weary of}} making films, and he sold a {{substantial}} amount of his studio stock to Seven Arts Productions on November 14, 1966. [...] Some observers believed that Ben Kalmenson, Warner Bros.'s executive vice president, persuaded Warner to sell his stock so that Kalmenson could assume leadership of the studio. [...] Warner, however, had personal reasons for seeking retirement. [...] His wife, Ann, continually pressured him to [...] "slow down", and the aging studio head felt a need to put his affairs in order. [...] Warner sold his 1.6million shares of studio stock shortly after producing the film adaptation of Lerner & Loewe's Camelot. [...] The sale yielded, after capital gains taxes, about $24million (equivalent to $ million today). [...] Eight months after the sale, Warner quipped, [...] "Who would ever have thought that a butcher boy from Youngstown, Ohio, would end up with twenty-four million <b>smackers</b> in his pocket?"

50|$|In <b>Smacker</b> video, a {{frame is}} split into 4×4 blocks in raster-scan order. Each block can be coded {{in one of}} six coding modes: skip, fill, mono, and three full modes. Each mode can be {{signaled}} for multiple blocks in a run-length encoding scheme. In skip mode, the current block is copied from the previous frame in a conditional replenishment fashion. In fill mode, the current block is filled with a single color. In mono mode, the palette is locally reduced from 256 colors to two colors. Both colors are written to the bitstream and one bit per pixel is used to indicate {{which of the two}} colors a pixel should be. The mono mode can be interpreted as vector quantization, where a three-dimensional vector with the components red, green, and blue is quantized using an adaptive codebook with two entries. There are three full modes, one was specified in version 2 of the <b>Smacker</b> format, while the other two were added in version 4. In the original full mode, 16 colors are transmitted, one for each pixel, equivalent to raw uncompressed PCM. The two full modes added in version 4 use 4 and 8 colors in a block, respectively. In the 4-color mode, the 4×4 block is split into four 2×2 blocks, each of which is filled with a solid color. In the 8-color mode, the 4×4 block is split into eight 1×2 blocks, each of which is filled with a solid color.|$|E
