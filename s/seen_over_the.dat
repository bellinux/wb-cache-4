5|$|Pettigrew State Park is home {{to several}} species of birds of prey. Ospreys build their nests in {{the tops of the}} tallest trees in the park and feed on the {{abundant}} fish of Lake Phelps. The population of bald eagles is increasing and they are occasionally <b>seen</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> park. At least three species of owl, the great horned owl, barred owl and eastern screech owl, make their home in the forests of the park, as do red tailed and red shouldered hawks. American kestrel and northern harriers also find suitable habitats at Pettigrew State Park.|$|E
5|$|Bears, {{both black}} and brown, are seen in Glacier Bay in the {{intertidal}} zone which they frequent for foraging. They are also seen “scraping barnacles off of rocks and munching mussels.” Invariably they are spotted wandering alone along the beaches of the Glacier Bay in search of salmon. The habitats of the black bears are generally the southern forested areas of the bay. However, the brown bears are mostly found in the northern, more recently glaciated zones of the Glacier Bay. Occasionally, black bears are sighted near the glaciers or near Gustavus town. Black bears with black dots and brown bears with brown dots have been <b>seen</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> last 10 years. Their travel routes {{have been identified as}} along the easy tracks such as along beaches, stream beds and river valleys. The most commonly identified locations for sighting bears in the Glacier Bay are: The Bartlett Cove, the Bartlett River, the Beardslee Islands and North and South Sandy Cove locations for black bears, while brown bears are seen to the north of Tidal Inlet in the west arm of glacier and north of Adams Inlet in the east arm. They are also seen swimming in the Bay, crossing from one bank to the other. Salmon are their favorite food, apart from bumblebees, sand fleas, bird eggs, birds, voles and marine mammal carcasses.|$|E

25|$|Leo {{held fast}} by {{his plan to}} revive iconoclasm, and in March 815 the Patrarch Nikephoros was {{stripped}} of his office and exiled to Bithynia.

On March 25, Palm Sunday, he commanded his monks to process through the monastery's vineyard, holding up icons so that they could be <b>seen</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> walls by the neighbors.

25|$|The present Sanctuary started {{being built}} in 1722, under the {{patronage}} of the Archbishop of Braga, Rodrigo de Moura Telles. His coat of arms is <b>seen</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> gateway, {{in the beginning of}} the stairway. Under his direction the first stairway row, with chapels dedicated to the Via Crucis, were completed. Each chapel is decorated with terra cotta sculptures depicting the Passion of Christ. He also sponsored the next segment of stairways, which has a zigzag shape and is dedicated to the Five Senses. Each sense (Sight, Smell, Hearing, Touch, Taste) is represented by a different fountain. At the end of this stairway, a Baroque church was built around 1725 by architect Manuel Pinto Vilalobos.|$|E

No further paint loss was <b>seen</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> subsequent twenty five years. Although the Strat was left abandoned in a rainy ditch for days after being stolen from the back of a tour van in Dublin, this is not believed to have caused any ill effect. The paint removal and appearance of extensive road wear was in keeping with Gallaghers public persona and image. A borrowed Telecaster was also stolen at the same time but never recovered. When the Strat was recovered two weeks later, Gallagher swore he would never sell it or paint it.|$|E

A relief showing the Queen is <b>seen</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> tomb, and the sides are decorated with the Apostles under round arched gallery. Other reliefs show the King, surrounded by their children, mourning the late Queen, as well as Christ surrounded by a mandorla and the symbols of the Four Evangelists.

25|$|The Gishwati Area Conservation Program (GACP) {{began in}} 2007 with the {{collaboration}} of Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, and Great Ape Trust, founded by philanthropist Ted Townsend. The initiative {{began with the}} idea of creating a national conservation park in Rwanda to protect the biodiversity of the Gishwati Forest area and stop some of the rapid degradation. In 1930 the Gishwati Forest covered 70,000 acres but lost about 90 percent of its cover, this initiative aimed to restore the dramatic loss the area has <b>seen</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> last decade and therefore named the site the Forest of Hope. In 2011, the GACP was succeeded by a Rwandan non-governmental organization known as the Forest of Hope Association, which is currently managing the Gishwati Forest Reserve (GFR).|$|E
25|$|Philip IV, who had <b>seen</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{course of}} his life the declining {{influence}} of Spain's empire, sank slowly into depression after he had to dismiss his favorite courtier, Olivares, in 1643. In 1646, his eldest son and heir Don Baltasar Carlos {{died at the age}} of 16. Charles was manipulated by various political factions throughout his life. For a short time under Don Juan José de Austria as valido the nobility came to dominate Spain once again. Most were self-serving, but there were a few such as the Count of Oropesa, who managed (despite ruinous deflation) to stabilize the currency. Others tried to weaken the power of the Inquisition (which however was not abolished until 1808) and encourage economic development.|$|E

25|$|On 22 September 2006, French Air Force jets were <b>seen</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{skies of}} Beirut during Hassan Nasrallah's victory speech, {{possibly}} {{trying to protect}} him from an Israeli assassination attempt. Nasrallah told the crowd that he had no fear in addressing the masses directly, rather than through armored glass. In September 2006, Hezbollah fighters raided an Israeli arms depot in Shomera, and made off with a large quantity of sidearms, grenades, anti-tank weapons, and LAU rockets. Five Israeli Merkava tanks, an armored bulldozer, and a number of military vehicles entered Lebanon and attempted to search the Hezbollah-controlled village of Marwahin for the arms. They were confronted by four French Army Leclerc tanks, which blocked their advance. The confrontation lasted for half an hour. According to American and German correspondents, the French retreated, while the French commander claimed that the Israelis had turned back. French commander of UNIFIL Alain Pellegrini stated that France would not intervene to disarm Hezbollah.|$|E

50|$|According to Leviticus 12, a {{woman who}} gives birth to a son remains impure for a week, and {{afterwards}} immerses in {{a body of water}} to purify herself. In rabbinical interpretation of Leviticus 12 any subsequent blood she <b>sees</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> next 33 days would be considered dam tahor (ritually clean blood), and that blood does not prohibit her from sexual relations with her husband. The law for {{a woman who}} gives birth to a daughter is the same, however, the durations are doubled.

500|$|To attract Formula One {{drivers to}} the championship, seats were {{guaranteed}} in the Procar races by cars which were entered by the factory BMW team.

[...] This not only guaranteed Formula One driver participation, but also allowed for a variety of drivers to be <b>seen</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> course of the season. [...] However, because the series ran Goodyear tyres, several Formula One drivers were not allowed to compete due to contractual obligations with competing tyre manufacturer Michelin. [...] As Scuderia Ferrari and Renault were selling roadcars themselves, they did not allow their Formula One drivers to participate and implicitly endorse BMW.|$|E
500|$|... "Providence" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a B+ rating. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it a 9 out of 10.

I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… those who bash these episodes simply because they relate to the “new direction” ought to be ashamed of themselves.

[...] Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk concluded that [...] "Providence", along with the previous episode [...] "Provenance", [...] "does a fairly good job without including Duchovny" [...] due to its adherence to [...] "the series' main storyline [...] the government conspiracies." ...|$|E

These batteries had also been suffering from effective counter-battery fire from the EEF Heavy Artillery Groups. Refet had been warned the day before that evacuation may be necessary because of the loss of Beersheba, so plans were prepared for the complete withdrawal from the town during the night of 6/7 November, to a new defensive line on the Wadi Hesi. Falkenhayn commanding Yildirim Army Group realised that the Ottoman forces could not hold the EEF any longer, and he ordered the Eighth and Seventh Armies to withdraw about [...] The first indications of the withdrawal were seen by EEF aerial reconnaissance, which reported Ottoman hospitals being moved back towards Mejdel. At midnight on 6/7 November, XXI Corps infantry patrols found Gaza had been evacuated by the Ottoman defenders. Until 6 November, German aircraft had rarely been <b>seen</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Gaza lines, but that afternoon two R.E.8s and two B.E.12.as from No. 1 Squadron AFC patrolling and taking photographs were attacked and badly damaged by four Albatros aircraft.|$|E
