We assessed year-to-year variation in sexual <b>selection</b> on <b>body</b> size and postcopulatory sperm competition and cryptic female choice.

In years when the "quality" of a female's partners was more variable (in standard errors of a male sexual ornament), clutches showed less multiple paternity. This agrees with prior laboratory trials in which females exercised stronger cryptic female choice when male quality varied more. An increased number of sires contributing to within-clutch paternity decreased the risk of having malformed offspring. Ultimately, such variation may contribute to highly dynamic and shifting selection mosaics in the wild, with potential implications for the evolutionary ecology of mating systems and population responses to rapidly changing environmental conditions...|$|R

We measured the following descriptors of reproductive output: clutch size and mass, relative clutch mass (RCM), average egg mass and offspring size. We found a positive relationship between maternal size and clutch size and mass, but no relationship between maternal size and RCM, average egg mass or hatchling size, demonstrating that the relative reproductive output is not influenced by female size, and that the only way to increase reproductive output is for the female to attain a greater body size.

Social influences on the evolutionary process can be assessed using a multilevel selection approach that partitions the effects of social partner phenotypes on fitness (referred to as social or group selection) from those of the traits of a focal individual (nonsocial or individual selection). To quantify the contribution of social selection to total selection affecting a trait, the patterns of phenotypic association among interactants must also be considered. We estimated selection gradients on male body size in a wild population of forked fungus beetles (Bolitotherus cornutus). We detected positive nonsocial selection and negative social <b>selection</b> on <b>body</b> size operating through differences in copulation success, indicating that large males with small social partners had highest fitness.

While changes in prey availability and interspecific competition {{have been linked to}} patterns of prey <b>selection,</b> <b>body</b> condition, and survival in coral reef fishes, rarely has the influence of abiotic environmental conditions on foraging been considered. We used underwater digital video to explore how prey availability and wave exposure influence the behavioural time budgets and prey selectivity of four species of obligate coral-feeding butterflyfishes. All four species displayed high selectivity towards live hard corals, both in terms of time invested and frequency of searching and feeding events. However, our novel analysis revealed that such selectivity was sensitive to wave exposure in some species, despite there being no significant differences in the availability of each prey category across exposures. In most cases, these obligate corallivores increased their selectivity towards their most favoured prey types at sites of high wave exposure. This suggests there are costs to foraging under different wave environments that can shape the foraging patterns of butterflyfishes in concert with other conditions such as prey availability, interspecific competition, and territoriality. Given that energy acquisition is crucial to the survival and fitness of fishes, we highlight how such environmental forcing of foraging behaviour may influence the ecological response of species to the ubiquitous and highly variable wave climates of shallow coral reefs...|$|E

To investigate the evolutionary basis of natal philopatry in a noncooperative species, the common goldeneye Bucephala clangula, we studied possible {{costs and benefits of}} simultaneous breeding of females and philopatric daughters. We did not find any fitness consequences of a daughter’s breeding on their mother’s breeding in terms of nest-site <b>selection,</b> <b>body</b> weight, clutch size, hatching date, or hatching success. Our results, therefore, did not support the assumption of the local resource competition hypothesis, that the natally philopatric sex should be more costly to a breeding parent. As possible benefits for daughters returning to their natal area, we tested inheritance of nest sites from mothers and explored whether daughters utilize the presence of their mother by parasitically sneaking into her mother’s nest. Daughters ’ nest-site selection was not associated with the presence of their mothers. A comparison between daughters and control females revealed that daughters chose their nest site closer to their natal nest than expected by nest-site availability alone. Daughters could not expect to inherit a nest site from their mother, and we did not find other indications of cooperation between relatives either. The mother’s clutch size did not increase in the year breeding with the daughter, indicating daughters do not parasitize their mother’s nest. We suggest that benefits such as decreased nest predation risk associated with nesting close to the natal nest site may be important in the natal philopatric behavior of the species.

To investigate presumed intrinsic costs of large {{size in the}} yellow dung fly (Scathophaga stercoraria; Diptera: Scathophagidae), we established two replicates each of three body size laboratory selection lines (small, control and large; selection on males only), and subjected flies of the resulting extended body size range to various abiotic stresses. Response to selection was symmetrical in the small and large lines (realized h 2 ¼ 0. 16 – 0. 18). After 24 generations of <b>selection</b> <b>body</b> size had changed by roughly 10 %. Female size showed a correlated response to selection on male size, whereas sexual size dimorphism did not change. Development time also showed a correlated response as, similar to food limited flies, small line flies emerged earlier at smaller body size. At the lowest larval food limit possible, flies of all lines emerged at the same small body size after roughly the same development time; so overall phenotypic plasticity in body size and development time strongly increased following selection. Juvenile mortality increased markedly when food was extremely limited, large line flies showing highest mortality. Winter frost disproportionately killed large (line) flies because of their longer development times. Mortality at high temperatures was high but size-selective effects were inconsistent. In all environments the larger males suffered more. Initial growth rate was higher for males and at unlimited food. Small line individuals of both sexes grew slowest at unlimited larval food but fastest at imited larval food, suggesting a physiological cost of fast growth. Overall, extension of the natural body size range by artificial selection revealed some otherwise cryptic intrinsic juvenile viability costs of large size, mediated by longer development or faster growth, but only in stressful environments...|$|E

We investigated the effects of seasonal lighting conditions on health by assessing survival in an out-bred hamster species, Phodopus sungorus, comparing: 1) Early versus Delayed sexual maturity 2) Static versus Naturalistic photoperiods 3) A model of chronodisruption (LDLD) In the photoperiodic Siberian hamster (Phodopus sungorus), birth at the beginning of mating season (late spring) results in immediate onset of puberty. Pups born toward the end of breeding season (late summer) do not achieve sexual maturity until the following mating season. 1 The result is a stratification of developmental rates and proportion of life history in summer phenotype. These effects on survival have been scarcely examined. Evolutionary theory posits timing of sexual maturity as a major factor influencing life history and aging, specifically the relationship between earlier sexual maturation and shorter lifespan imposed through natural <b>selection.</b> <b>Body</b> weight is also photoperiodically regulated and has been closely related to lifespan in calorie restricted mice. Conventional laboratory photoperiods that are static from day to day and then change abruptly greatly alter early developmental timing and growth rates compared to naturalistic or Simulated Natural Photoperiods (SNPs). 2, 3 Compared to 12 month SNPs, advanced aging and increased mortality rates were observed in the mouse lemur living in an accelerated seasonal cycle with abrupt transitions (≤ 8 months/year) 4, 5. In addition, number of seasonal cycles was a better predictor of survival than chronological age (e. g. years old).

Despite this directional <b>selection,</b> <b>body</b> size among midges at UMBS remains polymorphic We investigated the possibility that sheet webs, a different type of web, are preferentially capturing larger midges i. e. that sheet webs select against smaller midges). To test this hypothesis, we compared means and variances for thorax length, thorax width, and the ratio of thorax length to width for midges caught by sheet webs vs. uncaught (free) midges. We did this separately for two midge species, tentatively called A and B, in two sites on the UMBS campus: Blissville and Manville. We found that evidence of directional selection acting on Species B midges in Manville (length: p= 0. 005, width: p= 0. 005, ratio: p= 0. 28). However, like orb webs, sheet webs favored larger midges.

For many animals, resource quality and intraspecific competition may mediate <b>selection</b> on <b>body</b> size producing large-scale geographic patterns. In two sequential experiments, we examine how variation in larval competition and resource quality (seed size) affects the fitness consequences of variation in body size in a scramble-competing seed-feeding beetle, Stator limbatus. Specifically, we compared fitness components among three natural populations of S. limbatus that vary in body size, and then among three lineages of beetles derived from a single base population artificially selected to vary in size, all reared on three sizes of seeds at variable larval density. The effects of larval competition and seed size on larval survival and development time were similar for larger versus smaller beetles. However, larger-bodied beetles suffered a greater reduction in adult body mass with decreasing seed size and increasing larval density; the relative advantage of being large decreased with decreasing seed size and increasing larval density. There were highly significant interactions between the effects of seed size and larval density on body size, and a significant three-way interaction (population-by-density-by-seed size), indicating that environmental effects on the fitness consequences of being large are nonadditive. Our study demonstrates how multiple ecological variables (resource availability and resource competition) interact to affect organismal fitness components, and that such interactions can mediate natural <b>selection</b> on <b>body</b> size.

Changes in body composition in the first period reflected the changes in body weights through a lower crude protein percentage at the start of the period and a lower ash percentage at the end of the period. Body composition at the start of the second period was not altered by selection, while at the end of the selection period ad libitum lines had higher dry matter percentages and restricted lines had lower fat percentages. Body composition at 100 days of age was not affected by selection except for dry matter percent, that was lower in the restricted lines. Correlated response in fitness was evaluated through litter size. In the first period lines selected under ad libitum feeding were not affected by selection for increased weight gain while selection for weight gain under restricted feeding caused a significant decrease in litter size...|$|E
40|$|If the energy-density of prey bodies is not uniform, predators usually should {{maximize}} their rate of energy intake while foraging by selectively consuming energy-rich regions of their prey and discarding other parts. In this study, {{the hypothesis of}} selective body-part consumption was tested using two species of dasyurid marsupials, Sminthopsis youngsoni and Ningaui ridei, and their invertebrate prey in and central Australia. Energy-densities were similar for several divergent types of prey, including whole insects, centipedes, and spiders (20. 2 +/- 2. 19 (sd) J/mg ash-free dry mass), but there were marked differences in energy-density among orders of insects and also between different body regions of invertebrates. In captivity, the two dasyurid species consumed different body regions of prey in the same way. For beetles and cockroaches, the rank order for <b>selection</b> of <b>body</b> parts was abdomen, thorax, head, then legs; for centipedes it was body, then head + legs; and for spiders it was opisthosoma, prosoma and then legs. <b>Selection</b> of prey <b>body</b> regions by the marsupials correlated closely with the energy-densities of these regions, and also with the rates of energy intake that they yielded. In the field, <b>selection</b> of <b>body</b> parts of arthropod prey by dasyurids probably occurs primarily when prey is abundant. This selection should allow maximization of rates of energy intake in favourable periods and should, in turn, allow dasyurid predators to effectively exploit pulses of prey resources in the temporally variable desert environment...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{cholesterol}} content of chicken eggs produced by two lines (high and low weight) representing the 31 st generation of selection for divergent growth was studied. Divergent <b>selection</b> for <b>body</b> weight at 8 weeks of age resulted in changes in egg size and consequently {{in the weight}} of egg components. Higher values (P ≤ 0. 001) were observed in eggs from the high weight (D+) line for egg weight, albumen, yolk and shell weight. Percent yolk was greater (P ≤ 0. 001) and percent albumen was lower (P ≤ 0. 001) in eggs from the low weight (D−) line. Eggs from the D− line contained lower (P ≤ 0. 001) cholesterol content (mg/ egg, mg/g yolk, mg/g yolk dry matter) than eggs from the D+ line but when cholesterol was expressed in milligrams per gram of egg or per gram of edible egg, {{differences between the two}} lines were not significant. Divergent <b>selection</b> for <b>body</b> weight changed the albumen : yolk ratio and a change of this type affected the grams of cholesterol per gram of yolk values...|$|R
