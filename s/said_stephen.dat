2500|$|In the Evening Standard, Alexander Walker {{called the}} film [...] "an {{impressive}} and touching work of intelligence, compassion and tragic stature" [...] and <b>said</b> <b>Stephen</b> Fry [...] "returns {{to the top}} of the class with a dominating screen performance." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "They {{outsource}} torture," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Stephen</b> Hopper, Habib's Australian lawyer, {{referring to}} the practices of the United States. [...] "You get your friends and allies to do your dirty work for you." [...] Habib has said {{that some of his}} interrogators in Pakistan had recognizable American accents, and that one had a tattoo of an American flag on his arm.|$|E
2500|$|The Bush {{administration}} reportedly {{went out}} of its way to make the transition as seamless as possible for the incoming administration, earning accolades from Obama staff members and outside experts alike. According to nearly all accounts, the Bush administration streamlined the process for new officials to obtain security clearances and planned training exercises for the incoming national security team, to ensure that they would be ready to face a possible crisis on the first day in office. Part of this enhanced cooperation is required by laws passed at the behest of the 9/11 Commission, while part is attributed to the difficulty that the Bush administration had with its own transition, which lasted only five weeks and was felt to have had a deleterious effect on Bush's ability to govern. [...] "I'm not sure I've ever seen an outgoing administration work as hard at saying the right thing", <b>said</b> <b>Stephen</b> Hess of the Brookings Institution. [...] "This is really quite memorable." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{thought that}} you might wish precise information, and so I {{prepared}} a small digest of the matter," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Stephens,</b> handing {{a slip of paper}} to Miss Sadie. She looked at it {{in the light of the}} deck lamp, and broke into her low, hearty laugh.|$|R

2500|$|King is {{a public}} critic of Paul LePage, the Republican Governor of Maine, and has {{referred}} to LePage {{as one of the}} Three Stooges, along with Florida Governor Rick Scott and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. [...] He was critical of LePage for incorrectly suggesting in a weekly radio address on March 18, 2015, that King avoided paying Maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year. The statement was later corrected by the Governor's office but no apology was issued. [...] King said LePage was [...] "full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green" [...] and demanded that LePage [...] "man up and apologize". [...] LePage declined to apologize to King, stating [...] "I never <b>said</b> <b>Stephen</b> King did not pay income taxes. What I said was, Stephen King's not in Maine right now. That's what I said." [...] LePage further told King that he should [...] "make me the villain of your next book and I won’t charge you royalties".|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the decade}} {{following}} the album release {{and with its}} follow-up slated and shelved twice, Cassie developed a cult following. She has been credited {{as one of the}} pioneers of [...] "experimental R," [...] and it was drawn attention to [...] "how far she's consistently been ahead of trends like the wave of atmospheric R" [...] "Cassie's is the kind of voice that demands your attention without caring whether or not it gets it," [...] Noisey's Emma Garland explained, [...] "It's spacious, seductive and borderline melancholy, which is why her material has been heavily sampled and remixed by an endless list of artists and producers." [...] Her debut album was subject of more recognition, particularly in the underground circuit. [...] "Me & U" [...] ranked in multiple [...] "Best of..." [...] lists by The Guardian, Complex and The Village Voice, among others – [...] " [...] recalled the crypto-emotional coolness of Cameo circa [...] "Single Life," [...] and proved the most refreshingly minimal r hit of the year," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Stephen</b> Troussé for Pitchfork, while Marc Hogan wrote for the same publication: [...] " [...] hasn't had a sophomore slump, because as of press time, [...] still hasn't released a sophomore album. Her self-titled 2006 debut [...] might just have been enough." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "At the worst, Miss Sadie, it {{will only}} be a {{question}} of ransom," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Stephens,</b> arguing against his own convictions. [...] "Besides, we are still close to Egypt, {{far away from the}} Dervish country. There is sure to be an energetic pursuit. You must try not to lose your courage, and to hope for the best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll do {{something}} yet," [...] she <b>said.</b> [...] "Mr. <b>Stephens</b> <b>said</b> you would. Oh, I like you, Jane Lavinia, you dear thing! Sometimes I haven't liked you because you're nothing to look at, and I didn't {{suppose you could}} really do anything worthwhile. But I do like you now after what Mr. <b>Stephens</b> <b>said</b> about your drawings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This must be {{the route}} I spoke of," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Stephens.</b> [...] "I {{remember}} marking it upon the map I made for you, Miss Adams. Baedeker says {{that it has been}} disused on account of the cessation of all trade which followed the rise of the Dervishes, but that it used to be the main road by which the skins and gums of Darfur found their way down to Lower Egypt." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But when I <b>said</b> that <b>Stephen</b> {{was much}} better to-day, she swept {{out of the room}} as if she did not care whether he lived or died." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you,' <b>said</b> <b>Stephen</b> laconically. 'She {{knew her}} mind {{as well as}} I did. We are the same age. If you hadn't interfered----' ...|$|E
6000|$|... --The affair doesn't {{interest}} {{me in the}} least, <b>said</b> <b>Stephen</b> wearily. You know that well. Why do you make a scene about it? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{is a great}} clue, {{considering}} {{there are}} about a score covers here of rival dinginess," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Stephen,</b> drawing out the canterbury.|$|E
6000|$|... "That sounds complimentary," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Stephen,</b> {{looking at}} his watch. [...] "By Jove, it's nearly half-past one! Well, I can just sing this." ...|$|E

5000|$|Stephens {{announced}} his retirement on August 2, 2011 saying that a newly redistricted map {{was a factor in}} his choice. The new map [...] "made the decision a little easier," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Stephens.</b> [...] "I could run against Cavaletto, or run in the new district. Neither of those choices was palatable." [...] By resigning before his term expires, Stephens made it possible for local Republican County Chairmen to pick a replacement, who could then run as an incumbent for the 2012 election. [...] On August 13, 2011 it was announced that Paul Evans would replace Stephens.|$|R

50|$|Stephens {{was born}} in Putney, London, England. He {{was four years old}} when picked for the part, which {{required}} him to have his blond hair dyed dark brown. In an interview with AMC, director Richard Donner <b>said</b> <b>Stephens</b> got the part after attacking the filmmaker (at Donner's urging), punching Donner in the testicles for good measure. It was the only major film role in Stephens' career; he would later play a small role in the 1980 TV film Gauguin the Savage. He also appears in the DVD special features section of the 2006 version of The Omen, and as a tabloid journalist in the film.|$|R
6000|$|Aunt Laetitia and the {{solicitor}} {{were old}} cronies, and their greeting was most friendly. When the old gentlewoman had seated herself and taken her cup of tea, Mr. Copleston <b>said</b> to <b>Stephen,</b> {{with a sort}} of pomposity: ...|$|R
6000|$|The pair parted {{company and}} Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his practised eye, {{was not without}} perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the {{encounter}} he <b>said,</b> laughingly, <b>Stephen,</b> that is: ...|$|R
