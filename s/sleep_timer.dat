2500|$|Scheduled {{for public}} release on 1 January 2017, all {{versions}} of Reflection were actually released on 31 December 2016; it was figured that such {{would be easier}} on those in the market business, as more work on New Year's Day in the record shops (if even open) and online stores was not desired. The generative version of Reflection is the fourth iOS App created by Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers: of generativemusic.com. Unlike the other Apps they released Reflection provides no real options other then Play/Pause – later, in its initial update, Airplay and <b>Sleep</b> <b>Timer</b> options were added. As well, being {{that they did not}} take into consideration that Apple had started increasing prices for Apps sold in UK, they lowered its price and provided links to a four track collection called 'Sisters' (each track with a 15:14 duration): a free downloadable album available to those who bought the App at a higher price.

Presentation settings that users may customize include the ability to disable the screen saver, adjust volume levels, temporarily display a specific background image on the display and/or change its position, and to automatically enable these presentation settings with individual display configurations.|$|R
50|$|People who {{regularly}} take power naps may develop {{a good idea}} of what duration works best for them, as well as what tools, environment, position, and associated factors help induce the best results. Some may prefer to take power naps regularly even if their schedules allow a full night's sleep. Mitsuo Hayashi and Tadao Hori have demonstrated that a nap improves mental performance even after a full night's sleep. New sleep sensors and <b>sleep</b> <b>timers</b> available on several mobile devices allow advocates of power naps to sleep for exactly as long as they would like.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We study a clock {{calibration}} {{problem for}} an ultra-low power timer on a sensor node platform. When the sensor {{is put into}} <b>sleep</b> mode, this <b>timer</b> {{is the only thing}} left running, so power consumption is extremely low. However, this power savings comes at the expense of loss in timing accuracy, which can result in unnecessary energy consumption from two unsynchronized devices trying to communicate. The speed of the timer is dependent on the ambient temperature. Because this dependence can be measured off-line, one way to improve timing accuracy is to periodically wake the processor up to take temperature measurements, and use these measurements in combination with the local clock ticks to obtain a more accurate estimate of the elapsed real time. The goal of this work is to dynamically schedule a limited number of temperature measurements in a manner most useful to improving the accuracy of the timer. We present a stochastic control formulation to solve this problem. I...|$|R

50|$|A <b>sleep</b> <b>timer</b> is a {{function}} on many modern televisions and other electronic devices that shuts off the power after a preset amount of time. The setting is usually made either from the remote control of the device or the device's menu. They are intended to allow viewers to watch as they fall asleep.|$|E
50|$|In this installment, {{released}} in 2004, the user can travel {{across the entire}} continental US, and also through northern Mexico and southern Canada, through 30 cities. The <b>sleep</b> <b>timer</b> was brought back in this version. It has an improved traffic model. 18 Wheels of Steel: Pedal to the Metal requires OpenGL. It also has the fastest map to date besides Haulin and is the first trucking game to feature more than one country.|$|E
40|$|As energy {{availability}} limits usage {{time for}} mobile devices, modern wireless systems implement Power Saving Mechanisms (PSMs). Determining optimal PSM parameters and switch points when applying all PSM mechanisms jointly {{in the same}} scenario is a trade-off between power savings and system performance degradation. This work presents an unpublished performance study of the joint operation of Sleep Mode and Idle Mode on an accurate 802. 16 e PSM NS- 2 simulation implementation, with the MS experiencing two different classes of Internet traffic, namely HTTP Web Browsing and Always-On traffic. We first determine which set of PSM parameters influence the most on power savings and performance degradation (in terms of TCP retransmissions) via a 2 k. r factorial analysis. Then, we explore those PSM parameters via full factorial analysis {{in order to determine}} optimal transition points between Sleep Mode and Idle Mode, such that we achieve power savings without high performance degradation. Results showed that although we managed to obtain good power saving results {{for a wide range of}} PSM parameters, performance degradation can be substantial if the <b>Sleep</b> Mode Inactivity <b>Timer</b> is such that PSM is activated within TCP RTT or the <b>timers</b> for <b>Sleep</b> Mode and Idle Mode are such that there is a “competition ” between which PSM mechanism should be activated. Under established conditions, we observe a significant power saving gains followed by a surprising system performance enhancement...|$|R
50|$|Introduced in Spring 2017Mondo+ a new {{build for}} Internet radios in the Grace digital family. This is the world's first {{internet}} radio with Chromecast built-in.A Kickstarter campaign {{was held to}} introduce the new device and the features it will contain. Utilizing the latest Wi-Fi audio streaming technologies from Google, with Bluetooth audio streaming, and over 30,000 AM/FM/HD radio stations from {{around the corner to}} across the globe via webstreaming. The Grace Mondo+ can even be controlled by the Google Assistant on devices like Google Home, the front panel controls, free smartphone apps, or the included remote control. The audio is updated in this new radio with custom made speaker drivers and high performance class D digital amplification, ensuring the best possible listening experience in a perfectly compact design. The Mondo+ has a 12 or 24 hour clock option, which displays {{in the center of the}} display when the radio is in standby, and displays in the upper left hand corner when the radio is playing music. There is an advanced alarm clock that supports up to 5 unique alarms. Each alarm can be set to alarm one time, a specific day of the week, 7 days a week, 5 days a week (Monday - Friday), or weekends only. You can set each alarm to use any of your saved 10 presets or buzzer. Each alarm has its individual volume setting. You can also access the alarm clock menu to adjust the alarms while the radio stays off. Integrated on top of the radio is an adjustable <b>sleep</b> and snooze <b>timer.</b> When the alarm goes off and you press the snooze bar it will snooze for 10 minutes. If you want to snooze longer simply press the snooze bar multiple times and it will go up in increments of 10 minutes with each press. All of these functions are controllable through the front panel, Infra-red remote (included), or free iPhone /Android smartphoneremote control appThe internal wifi card supports Dual band 2.4 and 5 Ghz and 802.11ba,g,n Wi-Fi routersMulti-room audio: The Chromecast built-in feature also allows you to create multiple different streaming groups. Group a Mondo+ with other Mondo+ radios, or any other Chromecast built-in compatible device (including a Google Home), and stream synchronized to all devices in the group at the same time.The 5v USB port on the back of the unit allows the Mondo+ to recharge your smartphone or tablet at any time.|$|R
50|$|The CBC English service {{launched}} the CBC Radio app for iPhone on August 13, 2009. The free app provides 19 live streams for Radio One, 2 and 3, and 60 on-demand services, including TV Audio and streams from CBC Music. The app runs on iPhone and iPod Touch devices 2.2.1 and higher, and includes additional {{features such as}} a schedule, <b>sleep</b> <b>timer,</b> and a favourites list. The app was updated in November 2010 to be usable on an iPad and includes additional functionality.|$|E
50|$|The switch may be {{connected}} to an electric circuit operating from mains power, including via a relay or contactor; or low voltage, including battery-operated equipment in vehicles. It may be built into power circuits (as with a central heating or water heater timer), plugged into a wall outlet with equipment plugged into the timer instead of directly into the power point; or built into equipment as, for example, a <b>sleep</b> <b>timer</b> that turns off a television receiver after a set period.|$|E
50|$|This {{installment}} is {{very similar}} to Hard Truck: 18 Wheels of Steel except that the graphics were updated, more trucks and cargo were added, and a new map was created that enables users to travel across the entire continental U.S., through 30 cities. In this version, players can choose from 30 trucks and 40+ trailers. Time is made up of a total of 24 minutes in a day in the clock. This game focuses on the delivery of cargo. Players will also battle 3 AI drivers. Unlike in Hard Truck: 18 Wheels of Steel, the <b>sleep</b> <b>timer</b> was removed from the simulation. There is an improved traffic model as well as airplanes, helicopters, and trains with authentic sounds.|$|E
5000|$|On Microsoft Windows, {{it appears}} that the timing of {{commands}} to hardware is not exact. Empirical data suggest that Windows (using the Windows <b>sleep</b> <b>timer</b> which accepts millisecond sleep times) will schedule on a 1024 Hz clock and will delay 24 of 1024 transitions per second to make an average of 1000 Hz for the update rate. This can have serious ramifications for discrete-time algorithms that rely on fairly consistent timing between updates such as those found in control theory. The sleep function or similar windows API were at no point designed for accurate timing purposes. Certain multimedia-oriented API routines like [...] and its siblings provide better timing consistency. However, consumer- and server-grade Windows ( [...] those based on NT kernel) were not to be real-time operating systems. Drastically more accurate timings could be achieved by using dedicated hardware extensions and control-loop cards.|$|E

40|$|Currently, the on-chip {{wireless}} communication system (OWCS) includes 2 nd-generation (2 G), 3 rd-generation (3 G), and long-term evolution (LTE) communication subsystems. To improve the power consumption of OWCS, a typical architecture design of system {{power control unit}} (SPCU) is given in this paper, which can not only make a 2 G, a 3 G, and an LTE subsystems enter sleep mode, {{but it can also}} wake them up from sleep mode via the interrupt. During the sleep mode period, either the real-time <b>sleep</b> <b>timer</b> or the global system for mobile (GSM) communication <b>sleep</b> <b>timer</b> can be used individually to arouse the corresponding subsystem. Compared to previous sole voltage supplies on the OWCS, a 2 G, a 3 G, or an LTE subsystem can be independently configured with three different voltages and frequencies in normal work mode. In the meantime, the voltage supply monitor, which is an important part in the SPCU, can significantly guard the voltage of OWCS in real time. Finally, the SPCU may implement dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) for a 2 G, a 3 G, or an LTE subsystem, which is automatically accomplished by the hardware...|$|E
30|$|The {{algorithm}} for schedule randomization {{is organized}} in a distributed manner. Every node uses a PseudoRandom Function (PRF) to obtain its transmission schedule {{from the current}} network key and its node ID. The transmission schedule consists of different slot indexes {{that can be used}} for transmission to neighboring nodes. The schedule changes for every frame (i.e., 32 slots) and during a frame, a node transmits only on the time-slots determined by its PRF output. After transmission, every node goes to sleep, setting its <b>sleep</b> <b>timer</b> to wake up for the earliest receive or transmit slot. In this way, energy consumption is reduced to minimum.|$|E
40|$|Consumption {{of energy}} {{is one of}} the major {{problems}} in wireless sensor network, as sensor nodes driven on battery power. Therefore, it is intended to minimize the power consumption by putting the wireless interface of the sensor nodes in low power sleep mode. Wireless sensor networks constructed with hundreds and thousands of wireless sensor nodes and they deployed to solve different problems of our life. Therefore, design solutions for reduced resource consumption of wireless nodes have a remarkable impact in green network setup. Probability of each state has to be determined to analyze the energy consumption in duty cycle. In this paper steady state probability of sensor nodes are analyzed and derived, i. e., sleep, listen, and active states, in terms of traffic characteristics and timer values, i. e., <b>sleep</b> <b>timer,</b> listen timer, and active timer. This work can be a guideline for appropriate timer selection for sensor network can be achieved for efficient energy conservation and the methodology developed here can lead to other duty cycle based energy conservation schemes with different sensor nodes.

40|$|In sensor network, energy {{conservation}} {{is one of}} the most critical issues since sensor nodes should perform a sensing task for a long time (e. g., lasting a few years) but the battery of them cannot be replaced in most practical situations. For this purpose, numerous {{energy conservation}} schemes have been proposed and duty cycling scheme is considered the most suitable power conservation technique, where sensor nodes alternate between states having different levels of power consumption. In order to analyze the energy consumption of energy conservation scheme based on duty cycling, it is essential to obtain the probability of each state. In this paper, we analytically derive steady state probability of sensor node states, i. e., sleep, listen, and active states, based on traffic characteristics and timer values, i. e., <b>sleep</b> <b>timer,</b> listen timer, and active timer. The effect of traffic characteristics and timer values on the steady state probability and energy consumption is analyzed in detail. Our work can provide sensor network operators guideline for selecting appropriate timer values for efficient energy conservation. The analytical methodology developed in this paper can be extended to other energy conservation schemes based on duty cycling with different sensor node states, without much difficulty...|$|E
