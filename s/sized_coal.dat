The product size distributions from the pendulum tests conducted on a range of closely <b>sized</b> <b>coal</b> particles are described as a one parameter family of curves. This parameter is related to the specific comminution energy (kWh/tonne) measured in the pendulum tests and particle size effects are normalized in this relationship.

40|$|This work {{introduces}} {{a method for}} determining coal devolatilization, char burning, limestone calcination, and sulfur sorption rates based on the analysis of CO[subscript] 2 and SO[subscript] 2 profiles from a fluidized bed combustor. The technique is non-intrusive and can be performed under realistic combustion conditions. The method involves batching coal or limestone samples in a fluidized bed heated with propane gas or other fuel. Carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide profiles are analyzed with linear models to obtain characteristic time constants for coal devolatilization, char burning, and sulfur sorption. Time constants for coal devolatilization and char burning can be directly related to devolatilization times and char burnout times, respectively, for a coal sample. Characteristic times for calcination and sulfur sorption {{can be related to}} the rate of limestone calcination and sulfation in the fluidized bed, respectively;Experiments to validate the technique were carried out in a 0. 2 m dia. pilot fluidized bed combustor. Single <b>sized</b> <b>coal</b> and limestone samples were used for the validation tests. Coal devolatilization and char burning times obtained by this technique are comparable to times measured by more conventional thermogravimetric and visual techniques. Activation energies obtained for limestone calcination are quite close to those obtained by thermogravimetric methods. However, lower than expected activation energies obtained for the sulfation of limestone were attributed to complex pore diffusion processes;Time constants for calcination were found to be proportional to particle size, suggesting that chemistry is rate limiting during this process. Sulfation time constants were weakly related to particle size, an idication that both chemistry and pore diffusion are rate limiting...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Limited data is {{currently}} available for diesel particulate matter (DPM) and {{polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH) exposure in underground coal mines in South Africa. The lack of regulatory exposure limits for DPM and PAH in South Africa {{makes it difficult for}} the mining industry to evaluate concerned exposure results effectively. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine load haul dump (LHD) vehicle operator exposure to DPM and PAH in four small to medium <b>sized</b> <b>coal</b> mines. Exposures were measured against international standards which could appropriately be implemented in South Africa. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) method 5040 was used to measure exposure for DPM using submicron elemental carbon as surrogate. NIOSH method 5515 was used to measure exposure towards seventeen PAH compounds. Exposure results for DPM were far below the available exposure limit. The use of two LHD vehicles underground showed results that were 2. 6 times higher than when one LHD vehicle was used. Exposure results for PAH showed values below laboratory detection limits. The TC/EC values for the four coal mines indicated that the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) TC/EC value of 1. 3 is not suitable for South African coal mines if the MSHA standards for DPM were to be adopted in South Africa. The findings of this study are consistent with another local study conducted in 2008. To conclude, this study emphasized the urgency to establish regulatory exposure limits for DPM and PAH.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the flotation characteristics of Iowa coals in which various conditions were applied to study the effect of different parameters such as frother dosage, oily collectors, pyrite depressants, and various combinations of these reagents. Flotation tests were also conducted with Appalachian coals for comparison;Iowa coals did not respond as well to froth flotation as Appalachian coals. Although Iowa coal floated very slowly and incompletely with only a frother (methyl isobutyl carbinol or MIBC), it floated rapidly when a large dosage of an oily collector (No. 200 LLS fuel oil) was employed in addition. No. 1 fuel oil {{was not nearly as}} effective as a collector for this application. The order of addition of flotation reagents appeared very important for achieving a high recovery of Iowa coal;Appalachian coals floated rapidly with only a frother (methyl isobutyl carbinol) or an alkaline solution. A small amount of an oily collector increased the recovery of Appalachian coals significantly. The results of these flotation experiments showed that little mineral matter was removed when a high recovery was achieved. A microscopic analysis of Appalachian coal used in these experiments showed that much of the mineral matter was incompletely liberated from the coal particles. And, the use of ultrasonics did seem to improve mineral matter liberation;Bubble-particle attachment was studied from a theoretical view point. This study showed that the mechanism of attachment differs depending on the relative size of bubbles and particles. When small bubbles adhere to a flat or slightly curved surface of a particle, the bubble size was found to be determined by the contact angle between the bubble and the particle. The study indicated that micro-bubbles could separate mineral matter from low rank coal more selectively than macro-bubbles could. When a micro-bubble flotation technique was employed to float Appalachian coal, it produced a cleaner coal product than conventional macro-bubble flotation;A general kinetic model was proposed to represent the rate of flotation of coal. For two Appalachian coals, the model successfully represented the flotation kinetics of uniformly <b>sized</b> <b>coal.</b> The proposed model also represented well the flotation kinetics of coal consisting of two sizes of particles...|$|E

40|$|Intensive {{animal feeding}} {{operations}} create {{large amounts of}} animal waste that must be safely disposed of {{in order to avoid}} environmental degradation. Cattle feedlots and chicken houses are two examples. In feedlots, cattle are confined to small pens and fed a high calorie grain diet in preparation for slaughter. In chicken houses, thousands of chickens are kept in close proximity. In both of these operations, millions of tons of manure are produced every year. In this project a co-firing technology is proposed which would use manure that cannot be used for fertilizer, for power generation. Since the animal manure has economic uses as both a fertilizer and as a fuel, it is properly referred to as feedlot biomass (FB) for cow manure, or litter biomass (LB) for chicken manure. The biomass will be used a as a fuel by mixing it with coal in a 90 : 10 blend and firing it in existing coal fired combustion devices. This technique is known as co-firing, and the high temperatures produced by the coal will allow the biomass to be completely combusted. Therefore, it is the goal of the current research to develop an animal biomass cofiring technology. A cofiring technology is being developed by performing: (1) studies on fundamental fuel characteristics, (2) small scale boiler burner experiments, (3) gasifier experiments, (4) computer simulations, and (5) an economic analysis. The fundamental fuel studies reveal that biomass is not as high a quality fuel as coal. The biomass fuels are higher in ash, higher in moisture, higher in nitrogen and sulfur (which can cause air pollution), and lower in heat content than coal. Additionally, experiments indicate that the biomass fuels have higher gas content, release gases more readily than coal, and less homogeneous. Small-scale boiler experiments revealed that the biomass blends can be successfully fired, and NO{sub x} pollutant emissions produced will be similar to or lower than pollutant emissions when firing coal. This is a surprising result as the levels of N are higher in the biomass fuel than in coal. Further experiments showed that biomass is twice or more effective than coal when used in a reburning process to reduce NO{sub x} emissions. Since crushing costs of biomass fuels may be prohibitive, stoker firing may be cost effective; in order simulate such a firing, future work will investigate the performance of a gasifier when fired with larger <b>sized</b> <b>coal</b> and biomass. It will be a fixed bed gasifier, and will evaluate blends, coal, and biomass. Computer simulations were performed using the PCGC- 2 code supplied by BYU and modified by A&M with three mixture fractions for handling animal based biomass fuels in order to include an improved moisture model for handling wet fuels and phosphorus oxidation. Finally the results of the economic analysis show that considerable savings can be achieved with the use of biomass. In the case of higher ash and moisture biomass, the fuel cost savings will be reduced, due to increased transportation costs. A spreadsheet program was created to analyze the fuel savings for a variety of different moisture levels, ash levels, and power plant operating parameters...|$|E

Several adsorption and desorption experiments on anthracite coal with different grain sizes (0. 2 - 0. 25 mm, 1 - 3 mm) were performed under different equilibrium pressures (1 MPa, 4 MPa) to determine the parameters and to confirm the validity of the FFD Model.

40|$|Grinding coals to a {{pulverised}} coal specification for {{blast furnace injection}} can be costly, which is why some iron manufacturers choose a larger granulated <b>coal</b> <b>size</b> specification. However, there is a concern that these coals may have lower burnout in the raceway region {{so there is a}} technical and economic balance with coal grinding. This paper investigates how the process of grinding alters the physical properties, plus the surface chemistry, of coals and their chars formed in a drop tube furnace; it was found that in many cases the larger particle <b>size</b> <b>coals</b> gave improved combustion burnout compared to smaller sizes. The physical properties of the chars, formed from grinding <b>coals</b> to different <b>sizes,</b> resulted in char swelling in the smaller particle sizes, compared to char fragmentation for the larger size classifications. Minerals phases associated with better coal reactivity were found to undergo higher conversion to other chemical forms with the larger <b>size</b> <b>coals,</b> suggesting a potential catalytic or synergistic contribution to their burnout. A closer look at the surface chemistry suggests that the action of grinding coals has an important effect on the surface chemistry. The XPS spectra of the chars, formed in a drop tube furnace, indicated that grinding the coals to a smaller particle size reduced the carbon–oxygen and carbon–mineral interactions compared to the larger sizes and correlated with the higher burnouts. An increasing trend was identified for the carbon sp 2 bonding with larger size and higher rank coals which correlated with their burnout at low carbon conversions; however, this did not hold at higher conversions, suggesting other factors were more dominant...|$|R
