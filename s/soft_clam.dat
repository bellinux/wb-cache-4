Levels of Clostridium perfringens and fecal coliforms in these samples were evaluated to determine a relationship between incidence of these species and Vibrio species. A statistically significant relationship was found between Vibrio counts and C. perfringens counts in <b>soft</b> <b>clams</b> and seawater. No relationship was found between fecal coliform counts and Vibrio counts in the same samples or between C. perfringens and Vibrio spp. in river water. ^ The growth and survival of V. cholerae, V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus were determined in marine broth with different acids, pH levels, incubation times and temperatures. Greatest antimicrobial activity was observed at 25 C with lactic and acetic acids. All strains were capable of growth in media acidified with HCl at pH values lower than previously reported (pH 4. 8). ^ Inhibition of each Vibrio spp. by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was tested at four concentrations of sucrose added to growth medium. All of the Vibrio spp. were inhibited {{by the presence of}} mesophilic lactic acid bacteria. The inhibitory capacity of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus acidophilus against V. cholerae, V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus, inoculated in <b>soft</b> <b>clams,</b> was also evaluated. All Vibrio spp. except V. vulnificus were inhibited by the LAB in media with 1 % saccharose at 25 C. A higher inhibitory effect was obtained with L. acidophilus than with L. plantarum. At 5 C, all three pathogenic Vibrio spp. were inhibited. Thus, lactic acid bacteria could be used to inhibit Vibrio spp. in <b>soft</b> <b>clams,</b> or as a food safety system to guarantee rejection of Vibrio-contaminated seafood that has been subjected to temperature abuse. ...|$|R

Field observations supplcmcntcd by laboratory expcrimcntation indicated that Mya longer than 2 mm can tolerate salinities less than 1 % for at least 24 hrs and can withstand sudden salinity fluctuations of an order of 18 %. Tolerance of clams 2 - 25 mm in length to low salinities was found to be proportional to their size. Growth rate of clams living under different salinity conditions ranging in mean value from 3. 5 g 0 to 14 % was found to vary directly with salinity. The fact that the pumping rate of clams was observed to vary directly with salinity within the limits O- 31 %, is considcrcd sig-nificant in this respect. Comparisons of growth rates with phytoplankton concentrations suggested that flagellates form an important source of nutrition for Mya and that diatoms may be of relatively little importance...|$|E

Comparing Fe and Mn concentrations of porewater, bottom water, and hemolymph from sampling sites, Mn appears to be assimilated as dissolved species, whereas Fe apparently precipitates as ferrihydrite within the oxic sediment or bottom water layer prior to assimilation by the bivalve.

Lagoons and bays in the area around Sandy Hook hosted oysters, hard and <b>soft</b> shell <b>clams,</b> lobsters, blue crabs, and a variety of other invertebrates common in bays in the region today. South of western Long Island, tidal flats and wetlands occupied the margins of a tidal estuary (now submerged by marine waters). Inner Raritan Bay began to fill about 2,500 years ago with large oyster beds forming along the estuarine tributaries. Sea level continued to rise about one foot per century.

In this study, the shell and mantle tissue were analysed in order to retrieve knowledge about the secretion of shell matrix proteins (SMPs). Out of 67 and 127 shell and mantle proteins respectively, 16 were found in both shell and mantle. Bioinformatic analysis of SMP sequences for domain prediction revealed the presence of several new domains such as fucolectin tachylectin- 4 pentraxin- 1 (FTP), scavenger receptor, alpha- 2 -macroglobulin (α 2 M), lipocalin and myosin tail along with previously reported SMP domains such as chitinase, carbonic anhydrase, tyrosinase, sushi, and chitin binding. Interestingly, these newly predicted domains are attributed with molecular functions other than biomineralization. These findings suggest that shells may not only act as protective armour from predatory action, but could also actively be related to other functions such as immunity. In this context, the roles of SMPs in biomineralization need to be looked in a new perspective...|$|R
40|$|In nature the <b>soft</b> shell <b>clam</b> Mya arenaria {{develops}} a fatal neoplasm that shares molecular similarity with an unrelated group of human cancers. In leukemic clam hemocytes, wild-type p 53 and mortalin proteins co-localize in the cytoplasm. A similar phenotype, characterized by cytoplasmic sequestration of wild-type p 53 protein, {{has been observed}} in several human cancers (undifferentiated neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas, and glioblastoma). In some of these cancers p 53 is tethered in the cytoplasm by mortalin when the latter protein is overexpressed. Using co-immunoprecipitation we have demonstrated that mortalin and p 53 proteins are complexed in the cytoplasm of leukemic clam hemocytes (and not in normal hemocytes). In addition, treatment of leukemic clam hemocytes with MKT- 077, a cationic inhibitor of mortalin, disrupts the interaction of mortalin and p 53 proteins, resulting in translocation of some p 53 to the nucleus. Based on these data, we introduce leukemic clam hemocytes as novel and easily accessible, in vivo and in vitro models for human cancers displaying a similar mortalin-based phenotype. Treatment of these models with novel chemotherapeutics may help reveal the molecular mechanism(s) involved in inactivating p 53 by this form of cytoplasmic sequestration...|$|R

A retroviral etiology has been suggested based on the detection of reverse transcriptase activity and electron microscopic observation of retroviral-like particles using negative staining. To date, however no virus isolate and no retroviral sequence from HN has been obtained. Moreover, transmission of the disease by cell-free filtrate from affected clams has not been reproduced. In the current study, we reinvestigated the association of HN with a putative retrovirus. Sucrose gradient centrifugation followed by assessment of reverse transcriptase activity, electrophoretic analysis of protein and RNA, and electron microscopic examinations of fractions corresponding to retroviral density were employed. Detection of retroviral pol sequences using degenerate RT-PCR approaches was also attempted. Our results showed visible bands at the expected density of retrovirus in HN-positive and HN-negative clam tissues and both with reverse transcriptase activity.

40|$|Cownose rays, Rhinoptera bonasus, are {{considered}} voracious predators on mollusks {{and have been}} implicated in the consumption of commercially important species of shellfish on the East Coast. Digestive tracts of the 32 rays collected for this study from Pamlico Sound, NC and Chesapeake Bay, VA contained pieces of partially-digested tissue, well-digested tissue and fluid (chyme), and very small shell fragments which made identification to the species level nearly impossible. Visual content analysis of the stomach yielded 80. 78 % average unknown total tissue by weight and in spiral valves the total average unknown tissue was 94. 39 % by weight. Shell fragments were found in digestive tracts of specimens collected by bowfishing and haul seine (4. 54 % and 3. 02 % averages by weight, respectively). Tissue identifiable as bivalve was found in stomachs from cownose rays (> 90 cm disc width) collected by bowfishing. Fish parts were found in digestive tracts of cownose rays collected by haul seine but not by bowfishing or cast net (10. 24 % average by weight in stomachs and 2. 53 % average by weight in spiral valves). To provide {{a solution to the}} difficulty of identification of digestive tract contents by visual methods, molecular identification techniques, using the sequence of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, were applied to a variety of samples to determine the presence of key bivalve species of commercial and ecological importance in North Carolina and Chesapeake Bay. Species chosen were Atlantic bay scallop (Argopecten irradians concentricus), Baltic macoma clam (Macoma balthica), cross-barred venus clam (Chione cancellata), Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), hard <b>clam</b> (Mercenaria mercenaria), <b>soft</b> shell <b>clam</b> (Mya arenaria), and stout tagelus clam (Tagelus plebieus). Species-specific primers were designed from the COI sequences for each bivalve species. Primers were designed to amplify polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of differing sizes that were distinguishable from the other species of interest. Based on the primer design, multiplexing of several species in one reaction was possible, reducing testing time and cost. Results indicated that cownose rays in Chesapeake Bay ate stout tagelus <b>clams</b> and <b>soft</b> shell <b>clams.</b> Baltic macoma positives were most likely cross-amplification with stout tagelus DNA and further work is required to test for Baltic macoma clams without cross-amplification. There was no evidence of commercially important bivalves (hard clams, oysters, and bay scallops) being consumed by the rays in this study. Ontogenetic shifts in prey were difficult to determine based on uneven sample sizes, but large adult females (disc width over 90 cm) were found with a large proportion of stout tagelus clams in their digestive tracts.

We used the <b>soft</b> shell <b>clam</b> Mya arenaria as a model organism to compare the magnitude of rates of postlarval transport and predation on juveniles. We hypothesized {{that there is a}} critical size below which spatial variation in abundance of juvenile Mya is hydrodynamically controlled and above which abundance is mainly influenced by mortality, particularly due to epibenthic predators. To test this hypothesis, we examined transport and predation of early juvenile Mya in Barnstable Harbor, Massachusetts, USA.

Enclosure of the green crab Carcinus maenas changed the size distribution of Mya but did not significantly affect abundance. We attributed the effect of predator exclusion primarily to juvenile green crabs and fish. Current meter measurements suggested that tidal currents were strong enough to cause bedload transport of sediment and Mya. Measurement of gross and net rates of transport of Mya, using bedload traps and pans of defaunated sediment, confirmed that juveniles up to 5 -mm shell length were routinely redistributed by tidal currents, particularly during spring tides.

We document the presence of highly invasive European green crab (Carcinus maenas), mud crab (Rhithropanopeus harrisii), common periwinkle (Littorina littorea), <b>soft</b> shell <b>clam</b> (Mya arenaria) and blue mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) in ballast tanks of surveyed ships. Mid-ocean exchange did not affect macroinvertebrate occurrence, suggesting that current ballast water management regulations are ineffective for this taxonomic group. Viable individuals were recorded in vessels undertaking shorter voyages (average and maximum of 4. 5 and 15 days, respectively) and presence was not related to the amount of sediment in tanks. While presence and densities of macroinvertebrates were low, invasion risk may nonetheless be significant during reproductive seasons owing to high fecundity of some taxa. The highest risk may be posed by decapods since gravid females may carry thousands to several million eggs per clutch, and after several weeks of brooding, two or more subsequent clutches may be fertilized by retained sperm from an earlier mating. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Since all retroviruses possess reverse {{transcriptase}} (RT) enzyme, {{reverse transcriptase}} activity {{has been the}} main supportive evidence of retroviral etiology of haemic neoplasia (HN) in <b>soft</b> shell <b>clams,</b> Mya arenaria. The objective {{of the present study}} was to search for a putative retrovirus in various tissues of diseased clams following quantification of RT activity (biochemical indicator of retroviral infection). The clams were assessed by flow cytometry (FCM) for diagnosis of HN. RT activity was quantified by TaqMan-product enhanced reverse transcriptase (TM-PERT) assay in four different organs, gonad, gills, digestive gland, and mantle, at various stages of HN. The digestive gland, the organ with the highest RT activity, and haemocytes, the target cell of HN, were assessed by EM for presence of retroviruses. All organs were assessed by histology. The results of this study demonstrated that although all organs of healthy clams have some background RT activity, the activity observed in most of organs of diseased clams was significantly increased (p< 0. 05). An association was observed between the degree of neoplastic cell infiltration and the level of RT activity. Digestive gland showed the highest and most consistent RT activity in both healthy and diseased clams. No evidence for the existence of a retrovirus like particle was found by positive staining EM. The presence of RT activity without indications of retroviral particles in digestive gland and haemocytes suggests a probable endogenous source of RT.
