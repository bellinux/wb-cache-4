Criminal forfeiture is not permitted unless (1) a <b>substantive</b> <b>provision</b> exists for civil forfeiture of the criminal proceeds at issue; and (2) there is no specific statutory provision that permits criminal forfeiture of such proceeds. Thus, we read the statute ... permitting criminal forfeiture when no criminal forfeiture provision applies to the crime charged against a particular defendant but civil forfeiture for that charged crime is nonetheless authorized. In Croce, Dalzell had said it was [...] "highly unlikely that, in passing the broad language of CAFRA, Congress intended to silently remove the limitations on criminal forfeiture in mail fraud cases."

The South Africa Act and the Official Languages Act were repealed by the Constitution of 1961, which reversed the position of Afrikaans and Dutch, so that English and Afrikaans were the official languages and Afrikaans was deemed to include Dutch.

40|$|In this paper, I {{discuss issues}} on {{same-sex}} marriage and inheritance tax, mainly {{based on the}} case of Burden v United Kingdom, Windsor v. United States of America. The Civil Partnership Act 2004 granted the same rights that married couples enjoy - including that for inheritance tax - to civil partnership couples but not to family members. In Burden's case, plaintiffs asked the European Court of Human Rights for the same tax rights as married and civil partnership couples, which do not apply to cohabiting siblings. On the other hand, in the United States, DOMA had a <b>substantive</b> <b>provision</b> : Section 3 provided that for all purposes under federal law, marriage would be defined only as the union of one man and one woman. Because of this provision, for same-sex couples exemption from the federal estate tax was denied, and therefore, the plaintiff challenged DOMA as unconstitutional. Nowadays, the controversy surrounding LGBT rights has become heated, especially about same-sex marriage. It would seem that the need to discuss LGBT rights in economic terms is becoming increasingly important...|$|E

The burden of international commitments and the fact that increasing criminal activities have recently been committed by legal entities led the Czech legislator to adopt the criminal liability of legal entities which represents a great milestone for the Czech criminal law.

40|$|The {{success of}} the Racial Equality Directive (RED) in terms of {{effective}} protection against discrimination depends inter alia on the coherence and correlation between its substantive and procedural provisions, {{both in terms of}} the wording of the Directive and in terms of its interpretation and application. In this article, three ‘mismatches’ between the substantive law and its application are identified. Effective protection against discrimination requires that these mismatches are avoided. First of all, a teleological interpretation of a <b>substantive</b> <b>provision</b> should be matched by corresponding (broad) enforcement provisions. Secondly, the interpretation and application of the definitions of direct and indirect discrimination need to ensure a proper delineation of these substantive concepts. Thirdly, these substantive concepts have to be appropriately translated in terms of the enforcement dimension. In this respect, the ECJ has an essential role to play. In view of its special position as ultimate interpreter and guardian of the unity of EU law, it needs to take up the task of ensuring the ‘match’, while providing adequate guidance to the national courts. Although the ECJ remedied the first mismatch through its generous interpretation of the ‘flawed’ enforcement provision, it has failed to avoid the two other mismatches and thus has not realised the most effective protection possible against discrimination. It is to be hoped that the willingness to avoid mismatches between substantive law and its application will manifest itself more broadly in the future...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{takes the}} {{controversial}} position that Treasury regulations {{are entitled to}} judicial deference under the Chevron doctrine, as clarified by the Supreme Court in the more recent Mead case, whether those regulations are promulgated pursuant to specific authority delegated in a <b>substantive</b> <b>provision</b> of the Internal Revenue Code or {{in the exercise of}} general authority granted in Code Section 7805 (a). The Article attributes the unwillingness to concede Chevron 2 ̆ 7 s applicability to tax exceptionalism, the erroneous perception of many scholars that tax is different from other areas of the law, which {{in the context of this}} Article translates into the idea that tax should have its own judicial deference standards separate from the Chevron/Mead regime. This Article reviews a century of jurisprudence and scholarship to show that what many tax scholars and practitioners believe is a unique tax deference tradition is, in fact, merely consistent with broader deference principles espoused by the courts and scholars throughout administrative law. Further, while many in the tax community believe that aspects of tax law and practice render Chevron deference inappropriate for most Treasury regulations, this Article contends that tax closely resembles other administrative law areas in which Chevron deference clearly applies. Finally, having established that the Chevron/Mead framework should apply in tax cases, this Article applies the standard articulated in Mead to demonstrate that Chevron is the appropriate evaluative standard for Treasury regulations and responds to arguments suggesting an alternative outcome...|$|E
40|$|This thesis makes {{a unique}} {{contribution}} in exploring {{the relationship between}} international legal commitments and womenâs poverty. Three normative arguments underpin this thesis. First, that poverty is a gender-based phenomenon. Second, that gender-based poverty is a obstacle to human rights. Third, if the promise of human rights is to be realised for all people {{it is necessary to}} move gender-based poverty into the realm of international human rights law. The ideal place to theorise on the relationship between human rights and gender-based poverty is CEDAW. Notwithstanding that CEDAW addresses civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights and negative cultural attitudes on women, there is no <b>substantive</b> <b>provision</b> in CEDAW requiring State to ameliorate gender-based poverty. The first part of my thesis argues that this gap can be overcome by an evolutionary interpretation of CEDAW. I make the argument, that equality and non-discrimination, two norms that permeate all of CEDAW, can be interpreted to incorporate the harms of gender-based poverty comprehensively into the treaty framework. I use public international law interpretative framework and the Committee's own work to demonstrate that the commitment to eliminating discrimination against women and achieving gender equality in CEDAW necessarily requires State to respect, protect and fulfill the human rights of women in poverty. The second part of thesis shifts to examine how this interpretation can be integrated into the work of the Committee. To ensure a coherent and comprehensive approach to gender-based poverty that is consistent with my proposed interpretation of CEDAW in I propose: (i) modifications to the State reporting guidelines and (ii) a comprehensive General Recommendation on women and poverty. This thesis lays the necessary theoretical and practical groundwork so that the Committee and other relevant national and international actors can hold States accountable for women in povertyâs human rights. </p...|$|E

40|$|The anti-retaliation {{provision}} of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees who report perceived workplace discrimination or who otherwise {{participate in the}} investigative or enforcement process of alleged Title VII discrimination. The statute provides little guidance, however, as to {{the scope of this}} protection. Thus, disagreement abounded among the lower federal courts, not only as to whether the anti-retaliation provision prohibited employer acts outside the workplace as well as within, but also as to the level of severity to which an alleged retaliatory act must rise in order to support a claim. The Supreme Court sought to resolve this disagreement in June 2006 when it decided Burlington Northern 2 ̆ 6 Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, but its decision fails to supply a clear, judicially administrable standard by which employers can readily abide. Instead, by focusing its inquiry into the statute’s language and underlying purposes too narrowly, the Court’s decision is plagued by a vague standard with a highly subjective component that insulates employees who engage in protected activity from even the slightest workplace changes. This vague and subjective standard not only lacks sufficient support in the statute but also directly contravenes Title VII’s policies of workplace equality, employer forethought, and management prerogative. Moreover, courts will likely struggle to administer this standard with any substantial degree of consistency, and well-meaning employers will find compliance extremely difficult as a result. This Article therefore proposes that Congress intervene to correct the problems that the Court’s decision in White creates. Specifically, this Article suggests that Congress amend the anti-retaliation provision so that its language more closely mirrors that found in the statute’s core <b>substantive</b> <b>provision,</b> and the better-developed standards thereunder may control discrimination and retaliation claims alike...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the structural and organizational problems facing social insurance systems in Brazil and the Argentine through the twentieth century. It provides insights which inform contemporary debates about pension reform in Latin America. This area of social policy intervention is central to ongoing analyses of state competence and state capacity that in turn inform efforts to theorize about the state. Much of the present discussion depicts social insurance 'crisis' as a modern phenomenon. Similarly, preoccupations with the macroeconomic objectives of reform, such as the promotion of profitable pension funds {{as an adjunct to}} capital market deepening, long-term sustainability, equity and coverage, are often assumed to be peculiar to the late twentieth century. By contrast, this article stresses the generational and cyclical nature of the crises that have plagued social insurance regimes in both countries. It notes that pension funds established for influential groups of workers {{in the early twentieth century}} quickly developed substantial deficits and that this was a key factor driving the extension of social insurance (and hence the pool of contributors). Financial instability was exacerbated by states frequently raiding pension funds in lieu of effective fiscal systems. As part of this, the article analyses historic shifts between different social insurance 'models' (individual, capitalized accounts versus pay-as-you-go schemes and monopolistic state systems versus competitive arrangements), evaluating their impact on coverage, equity, financial stability and administrative effectiveness. The article also identifies what may be learnt from differences, as well as similarities, between the two systems. Key points of divergence include the relatively large historic role of the private sector in Brazil and the earlier <b>substantive</b> <b>provision</b> for rural workers there. These differences call into question assertions about the common nature and origins of social insurance crises in Latin America, and in turn about the nature of the state itself. The article finds that, unlike models of Western European welfare capitalism with which they are sometimes compared, social insurance regimes in Brazil and the Argentine were precocious and institutionally fragile. They were also ad hoc and subject to repeated 'reform'. For much of the second half of the twentieth century, the economic weight of the state in middle-income Latin American countries (particularly as regards economic outreach and social policy interventions) seemed to approach that of socialist countries in Eastern Europe. Yet the 'ideology' of growth often owed more to liberal capitalism, echoing East Asia's emphasis on 'state-supported late industrialization'. These contradictions are neatly captured in the historical trajectory of social insurance systems, which demonstrate that Latin American does not fit neatly with categorizations established in the varieties of capitalism discourse...|$|E
