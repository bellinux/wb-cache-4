A {{high rate of}} deforestation is the major problem in Indonesian forests. The 1997 economic crisis has triggered decentralisation of forest management.   This new situation caused additional problems. The rate of deforestation increased because of inattentive forestland conversion, forest fires caused by the strong 1997 / 1998 ENSO event, and illegal logging activities.   Multi-stakeholders, ranging from the forest management unit level, the district level, the provincial level, to the national level, require up-to-date forestry information, especially on the annual state of forest cover.   The MoF and Wageningen University has installed a SPOT-Vegetation medium resolution system in the WebGIS for limited users or multi-stakeholders to provide three monthly information of Indonesian forest cover. New methodologies for multi-resolution and multi-temporal optical and {{synthetic aperture}} radar (SAR) data have been investigated to comply with information requirements from multi-stakeholders at various management levels.   Three major forest monitoring systems are introduced. The first is the National Forest Observation System, which uses medium resolution SPOT-Vegetation data to monitor large Indonesian tropical forest areas and to provide annual information {{on the state of}} Indonesian forests. An intact forest concept is introduced and applied in the algorithm for forest cover analyses using SPOT-Vegetation data. The second system uses multi-temporal high-resolution optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to perform regular forest monitoring activities and to minimise the cloud cover problems.   This second system introduces new object segmentation methodologies for fusing and processing all high-resolution remotely sensed data types (i. e. panchromatic, multi-spectral, and SAR).   Combining all high-resolution data can track forest changes through time. The third system is intended to investigate the very-high resolution optical and interferometric SAR (InSAR) data for individual tree mapping and tree grouping.   Ikonos data can identify an individual tree based on the sun-spot and the tree-crown <b>shadow</b> <b>point</b> feature concept using the object segmentation methodology. The use of InSAR data can provide 3 D-tree mapping and tree grouping conditions in order to assess the forest-tree qualities. Forest conditions can be assessed by the degree of tree-clumping.   These three systems are integrated into an Executive Spatial Information System (ESIS). Requirements of ESIS resulted from the investigation of the forestry Management Information System (MIS) of Indonesian Ministry of Forestry (MoF).   A user friendly interface for ESIS in WebGIS format has been presented to MoF.   This WebGIS can assist MoF and other multi-stakeholders to achieve sustainable forest management at the forest management unit level, the district level and the provincial and national levels...|$|E
40|$|The Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) {{equation}} of state is a statistical mechanics based {{equation of}} state based on Wertheim's theory of associating fluids. Since SAFT is a statistical mechanics based {{equation of state}}, {{it is possible to}} include more physics in the model to make it more predictive. In this work we show the versatility of SAFT by applying it to monomers and polymers and include dipolar interactions in SAFT. SAFT is used to model phase equilibria in long chain-short chain alkane mixtures. It is shown that SAFT accurately models phase equilibria in these systems even when there is a large disparity between the chain lengths of the two alkanes. We then use the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) to model liquid-liquid phase equilibria in solutions of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) with hexane, heptane and octane. The effect of temperature, pressure, polymer concentration and polymer molecular weight on phase separation is studied. Finally, the effect of polydispersity on cloud point is also considered. SAFT results are compared with experimental data by de Loos et al. [1]. It is shown that SAFT can model the phase behavior of the polymer in different solvents at various state conditions with a single adjustable parameter. The applicability of SAFT to these monomers and polymers shows that it is a versatile thermodynamic model. We propose an algorithm for calculating phase equilibria of polydisperse polymer systems using the SAFT equation of state. The algorithm is formally exact and the computation time is independent of the number of pseudo-components used to represent the polymer molecular weight distribution. The algorithm makes use of the form of the SAFT equation of state and simplifications resulting from it to simplify the flash calculations. Distinctive features of the phase diagrams of polydisperse systems are illustrated by calculating the cloud point and <b>shadow</b> <b>point</b> curves of polyethylene solutions in ethylene using the algorithm proposed in this work. We present results from molecular simulation and statistical mechanics based theory for dipolar hard sphere chains and dipolar Lennard-Jones (LJ) chains. We consider the chains with dipoles on alternate segments. The equation of state is obtained by applying Wertheim's associating fluid theory in the total bonding limit to a mixture of non-polar and dipolar segments. It is shown that the theory developed here is in very good agreement with computer simulation. This theory simultaneously accounts for chain and dipolar effects and can handle multiple dipolar sites in a molecule. This is demonstrated by generalizing the theory to mixtures and applying it to dipolar monomers and copolymers. The theory accurately predicts the phase behavior of real dipolar fluids...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method for automatic detection of <b>shadow</b> <b>points</b> in digital images {{in order to}} improve the reliability of automatic triangulation. The new method is based on the model of <b>shadow</b> <b>points,</b> which contains the radiometric and geometric properties of shadow in the image. The first {{is that there is a}} distinct contrast along the edge of a shadow in the image. The second is that the surface around a shadow is not a smooth surface and the <b>points</b> in the <b>shadow</b> area have smaller elevation than the objects casting the shadow, such as trees or buildings. The proposed method works in two steps: it first detects points with high contrast by image processing, and then finds points where the terrain slope changes sharply in its surrounding area by using a local digital surface model (DSM) which is generated by image matching. The proposed approach has been implemented within Z/I Imaging’s automatic triangulation product – ISAT. The tests on different projects show that the proposed method can detect <b>shadow</b> <b>points</b> effectively and thus improve the reliability of the triangulation results. 1...|$|R
