40|$|The {{excavation}} for the 53 -story {{reinforced concrete}} One Museum Park West building (OMPW) in Chicago was constructed using combined support systems. The building {{was supported by}} caissons and a perimeter wall formed by secant piles which transitioned to tangent piles below {{the bottom of the}} cut. After installing the perimeter wall and deep foundations for the building, the excavation for the reinforced concrete central core was supported by a circular cofferdam made of sheet piles and steel ring beams. This excavation was made using conventional bottom-up excavation techniques.  The excavation {{for the rest of the}} building was made using a top-down method and was laterally braced with reinforced concrete floor slabs structurally connected to the <b>secant</b> <b>pile</b> walls and the reinforced concrete core. Field performance data during construction of the OMPW basements were collected with settlement points, inclinometers and strain gages installed in the concrete basement slabs. Significant settlements were observed adjacent to the excavation during wall and deep foundation installation, central core construction and top-down excavation. The influence of concrete material time-dependence of the floor slabs on the performance during top-down excavation is evaluated and a method for the separation of temperature-related strains from the excavation-induced strains in the concrete is described.  The construction of the basements is simulated with a 3 D numerical structural model to study the influence of the concrete material time-dependence of the floor slabs in the excavation-induced movements resulting from top-down construction. Computed strains in the floor slabs are compared with the observed performance data collected from the strain gages. For use in numerical simulation of the entire excavation process, hypoplasticity constitutive parameters for clays (HC model) at the element test level were calibrated with tests conducted on high quality block samples obtained from the excavation of Block 37 project in Chicago. They included oedometer tests, bender element measurements, and triaxial tests following different stress probes, and were further refined with seismic cone penetration results.  The entire OMPW excavation is simulated with the calibrated parameters with a fully coupled-flow deformation, three-dimensional finite element model.

40|$|Diaphragm {{and bored}} pile {{retaining}} walls {{are often used}} {{for the construction of}} basements, metro station boxes and cut-and-cover tunnels in urban areas. While diaphragm and <b>secant</b> <b>pile</b> walls are generally intended (and assumed in analysis) to be effectively impermeable, contiguous piles may allow through-the-wall seepage even when preventative measures have been undertaken. Provided the flowrates can be tolerated or dealt with, through-the-wall seepage should result in a reduction in pore water pressures behind the retaining wall compared with an impermeable construction, giving the potential for reductions in the depth of embedment and wall thickness, hence cost. However, this potential is rarely realised owing to the difficulty in quantifying with sufficient confidence the hydraulic regime associated with a leaky retaining wall. This paper reports the results of laboratory investigations and numerical analyses carried out to assess the effect of the inter-pile gaps on the pore pressure distribution around a contiguous pile retaining wall. The results show that the pore pressures behind the piles reduce significantly as the pile spacing is increased. Long-term field monitoring confirms that the pore water pressures are much lower than would be expected for an impermeable retaining wall in similar soil. The applicability of a simple expression linking the pile diameter, pile spacing and the effective permeability of an equivalent uniform wall is demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|In {{the article}} the authors {{estimate}} {{the possibility of}} building a high (100 m high) stone dam with clay-cement concrete diaphragm. This diaphragm is used as an antifiltering element and it is made of <b>secant</b> <b>piles</b> method of clay-cement concrete (method of "slurry wall"). This diaphragm should be constructed in several phases, in our example example in three stages. Numerical studies of the stress-strain state of such a dam show that considerable compressive stresses can appear in the diaphragm. These stresses can be significantly (3 [...] . 4 times) greater than the strength of clay-cement concrete in compression. However it {{should be taken into}} consideration that the diaphragm of such a high dam will be crimped by horizontal stresses, i. e. clay-cement concrete will operate in the triaxial compression. Under these conditions the strength of clay-cement concrete will be significantly higher, therefore, the diaphragm reliability might be provided with a margin. For this reason, the most important issue in the engineering of a high dam with such type of diaphragm is to select the required composition of clay-cement concrete. Increasing its strength by extension of the cement fraction could increase modulus of deformation. Therefore it could lead to compressive stress increase and the strength state degradation. Hydrostatic pressure generates the areas of tensile stresses in the clay-cement concrete diaphragm due to the arising bending deformation. It threatens the formation of cracks in the clay-cement concrete, especially in the nodes interface diaphragm queues. It is recommended to match the diaphragm queues using ferroconcrete galleries. This should ensure flexibility of deformation between the gallery and the diaphragm...|$|R
40|$|Geotechnical {{engineering}} guidelines mandate {{the use of}} {{the most}} onerous hydraulic criteria for the design of earth retaining structures below the water table. Consequently, favourable local conditions, including the geometry of the structure, are not usually exploited. This means that retaining walls in particular are typically designed to resist hydrostatic pressures below the water table. Investigations have shown however that pore water pressures, axial stresses and bending moments reduce when groundwater seepage is allowed through the segmented linings of shallow tunnels. Contiguous pile retaining walls, by their nature, are also permeable. Allowing for groundwater seepage through the gaps in a retaining wall formed from contiguous piles could result in the pore water pressures on the active side of the wall being less than behind conventional impermeable retaining walls such as diaphragm walls. Numerical simulations, laboratory flow tank experiments and long-term field monitoring were conducted to determine the impact of pile gaps on the hydraulic conditions around contiguous piles. A relationship between the resulting bulk permeability of the equivalent structure and the pile gap was derived from 2 D numerical analyses and verified by flow tank experiments. This expression can be used to calculate bulk permeability values for uniform retaining walls representing circular piles in 2 D numerical simulations. The permeability relationship was used to calculate and assign equivalent bulk permeability values for a continuous retaining wall of uniform cross-section during the back analysis of the hydraulic conditions around the contiguous pile retaining wall at CTRL, Ashford. Pore water pressures and horizontal total stresses from the back analyses were consistent with those from the field measurements but were much lower than behind retaining walls formed from <b>secant</b> <b>piles</b> in similar conditions.

40|$|Finite Element {{calculations}} {{are frequently}} {{used in the}} design of deep excavations because prediction of ground movements and wall deformation is not possible with classical limit equilibrium fixed earth support and free earth support methods. To solve such geotechnical boundary value problems successfully, appropriate constitutive laws should be used for the description of mechanical behaviour of the soils. Two possible behaviour of soils can be categorized as those with a constitutive law based on plasticity and those based on elasticity. A key distinction between the plasticity and the elasticity group is that in the latter, strains are recoverable upon decrease in stresses, where as in elastoplastic models strain are only partly recoverable. A crucial point in making the choice of a suitable soil constitutive model is the ease with which values can be assigned to the model constants. The level of investigations carried out and the type of data available is another factor. Considering the above points mentioned, the study summarizes the application of a simple linear elastic model and a non linear elastic [Hyperbolic] model for modeling the 15 m deep base excavation supported by an anchored <b>secant</b> bored <b>pile</b> wall. Finite element software SIGMAW is applied for a 2 -D plain strain type analysis.

The peculiarity of operation of this kind of structures is the specificity of physical, chemical and mechanical factors that negatively affect their durability. However, complexity of the technical solution execution does not allow us to completely replace these structures after expiration of their standard service life. Taking into account the uniqueness of the HPP, the programs for the operational suitability restoration are individual. The main problems of reconstruction are considered, which consist in the necessity of, firstly, increasing the station’s productivity, and secondly, ensuring the stability of the dam to erosion and scours. Research objectives: the goal {{of the study was to}} develop proposals for improvement of operational suitability of the Kayrakkum HPP based on data on the technical condition of its main units, buildings, and rockfill dam. Materials and methods: in the process of long-term operation, due to filtration processes, seismic influences, the performance parameters of buildings and structures of hydropower plants deteriorate, which negatively affects the reliability of their operation. Therefore, based on the methods of mathematical statistics, data on the projected flood were analyzed. The data on the technical condition of the main HPP equipment were also analyzed and the main directions of its modernization were determined. Results: an assessment of the probability of destruction of the dam showed the need to strengthen it to reduce water filtration. A comparative analysis of possible options for reconstruction of the Kayrakkum HPP has shown the need for an integrated approach that will allow us to solve both the issues of ensuring safety requirements in accordance with international quality standards and enhancement of the plant’s capacity to increase the generation of electricity, the demand for which has increased over time.

Urbanization is a {{phenomenon}} {{dating back to the}} early stages of humanity. Depending on the development of industrialization and urbanization, the economy has improved, so that large cities have occurred. In {{the first quarter of the}} twentyfirst century, urbanization move ahead of industrialization in Turkey. Uncontrolled urbanization has brought, with it increasing population growth, the need for land; land values have increased dramatically in order to meet the demand with the supply. Land crisis was able to take a breath as a result of construction of multi-storey buildings in small areas and construction of under ground structures via deep excavations. Therefore deep excavation has become one of the focal points of the geotechnical engineering. In order to perform deep excavations, shoring system is needed. Today, deep excavation can be made with different shoring systems. Most preferred ones are mini <b>piles,</b> bored <b>piles,</b> <b>secant</b> <b>piles</b> and diaphragm walls. Mentioned systems are vertical supports and as bearing system they are cantilever and can also be supported by prestressed anchors or struts. Taking into account the soil profile in the excavation region, groundwater level, depth of the excavation, neighboring structures and environmental factors, most accurate shoring system should be preferred to be safe and economical. Otherwise, the stress increase in the ground and settlements in neighboring buildings due to long-term draining of groundwater may occur. To design safe and economical shoring system, selected parameters and assumptions made should be close to reality. In result of the excavation of the multi-storey buildings with multiple basement, very high stresses occur. In this case, the diaphragm walls are one of the most safe system that can be preferred. Diaphragm walls are more rigid compared to the pile system and also allows observation of displacements that occurs during excavation. These displacement can be determined with inclinometers. Shoring system should be kept under control by comparing horizontal and vertical displacements obtained by instrumental observations made with inclinometers and the displacements specified during project. This study has been prepared to compare displacements that were calculated in shoring system with diaphragm walls, a type of deep excavation support system, with the displacements measured in the field; and to investigate the effect of changing soil parameters on the displacements. In this study, deep excavation support methods are outlined first. Then the support system used in this thesis which is diaphragm walls are discussed in detail. xxii General information about the methods used to observe the excavations has been given. In particular, the information focuses on monitoring the displacements that occurs in shoring systems via inclinometers. An example of a shoring application is analyzed by a finite element software program namely Plaxis. At this stage, general information about the project is given. The soil profile, the excavation depth and sectional properties are presented. In the thesis, the finite element method and Plaxis program are explained briefly. Then displacements obtained from Plaxis analysis are shown in different sections. Then displacements measured in the field are compared with the calculated displacements. In most of the sections, measured and calculated displacements are close to each other, in several sections, displacement results from Plaxis analysis are greater compared to the displacements measured in field. In the last part of the study, a parametric study conducted by proportionally inreasing the soil parameters (internal friction angle, elasticity modulus and cohesion) determined in the design phase. Different displacements were obtained according to the analysis with increased soil parameters. The effect of changes on soil parameters on displacements were investigated. Besides displacements, moments and shear forces occurred in diaphragm wall as a result of change of soil parameters are also investigated. These values are compared with the moments and shear forces calculated at the design stage and changes in the results are observed. During design process, idealized soil profile and determined soil parameters (internal friction angle, elasticity modulus and cohesion) and evaluation of the results obtained with great care is one of the most important factors of modeling close to reality. Otherwise over designed projects can be done and they can be uneconomical. Also under designed projects may result with hazardous situation threatening life and property. According to the analysis carried out within this thesis, it is observed that the calculated displacements and measured displacement were close to each other. But in some sections (Section 1, Section 2 and Section 4) displacements calculated by Plaxis program seem to be slightly higher compared to the measured displacements. In order to see the impact of changes of soil parameters on diplacements, internal friction angle, modulus of elasticity and cohesion values increased by 5 % 15 % 25 % and new analysis for all sections were made. The results of the analysis can be summarised as follows; - Increasing the angle of internal friction in the fill has caused decrease in the calculated displacements. - Increasing the modulus of elasticity of the fill did not cause a significant difference in the calculated displacements. - Increasing the angle of internal friction in rock did not cause a significant difference in the calculated displacements. - Increasing the elasticity modulus of the rock has caused decrease in the calculated displacements. - Increasing the cohesion of the rock did not cause a significant difference in the calculated displacements. xxiii With respect to the analysis on sections, for fill, internal friction angle, for rock, the modulus of elasticity can be effective on displacements. On the other hand the displacements obtained from parameters specified in the design phase and the displacement measured in field are close values. In some sections, it seems that the displacements measured in the field are smaller. Accordingly, it is seen that the system is generally formed in an economical and safe way. In addition, the effect of changes in soil parameters on shear forces and moments were investigated. According to the analysis; - Increasing the angle of internal friction in the fill has led to a reduction in moment and shear forces in Section 1, Section 4 and Section 4 a. - Increasing the modulus of elasticity in the fill has cause a decrease in moment, but no change in shear forces in Section 2, Section 3 and Section 5. - Increasing the angle of internal friction in rock did not cause a significant difference in shear forces and moments. - Increasing the elasticity modulus of the rock does not lead to a noticeable difference in the shear forces and moments. - Increasing cohesion in rock did not cause a significant difference in shear forces and moments. Increase in the cohesion of rock did not cause a significant diffence in shear forces and moments. During execution of deep excavations, occurring displacements should be observed with instruments to provide safety and to be able to project against any potential risks. Any loss of life or property can be avoided by taking precautions for risk factors as result of observations. In conclusion, the selection of the correct soil parameters at design state is essentially important for design to be realistic, safe and economical. Because in civil engineering applications soil conditions are known to have significant effect on engineering designs and construction methods. In order to determine the correct soil parameters, detailed soil surveys should be made primarily. Then, obtained data should be analyzed correctly and should be interpreted accordingly. Selection of the correct soil parameters is one the most important factors in the design state. Otherwise, the design would be devoid of the reality. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
