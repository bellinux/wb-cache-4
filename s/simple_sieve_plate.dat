40|$|The {{presence}} of callose in <b>sieve</b> <b>plates</b> {{has been known}} for a long time, but how this polysaccharide plug is synthesized has remained unsolved. Two independent laboratories have recently reported the identification of callose synthase 7 (CalS 7), also known as glucan synthase-like 7 (GSL 7), as the enzyme responsible for callose deposition in <b>sieve</b> <b>plates.</b> Mutant plants defective in this enzyme failed to synthesize callose in developing <b>sieve</b> <b>plates</b> during phloem formation and were unable to accumulate callose in sieve pores in response to stress treatments. The mutant plants developed less open pores per <b>sieve</b> <b>plate</b> and the pores were smaller in diameter. As a result, phloem conductivity was reduced significantly and the mutant plants were shorter and set fewer seeds...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sieve</b> <b>plates</b> have an {{enormous}} impact on the efficiency of the phloem vascular system of plants, responsible for the distribution of photosynthetic products. These thin plates, which separate neighboring phloem cells, are perforated by a large number of tiny sieve pores and are believed to {{play a crucial role in}} protecting the phloem sap from intruding animals by blocking flow when the phloem cell is damaged. The resistance to the flow of viscous sap in the phloem vascular system is strongly affected by the presence of the <b>sieve</b> <b>plates,</b> but the hydrodynamics of the flow through them remains poorly understood. We propose a theoretical model for quantifying the effect of <b>sieve</b> <b>plates</b> on the phloem in the plant, thus unifying and improving previous work in the field. Numerical simulations of the flow in real and idealized phloem channels verify our model, and anatomical data from 19 plant species are investigated. We find that the <b>sieve</b> <b>plate</b> resistance is correlated to the cell lumen resistance, and that the <b>sieve</b> <b>plate</b> and the lumen contribute almost equally to the total hydraulic resistance of the phloem translocation pathway...|$|R
40|$|Sieve {{elements}} {{are one of}} the least understood cell types in plants. Translocation velocities and volume flow to supply sinks with photoassimilates greatly depend on the geometry of the microfluidic sieve tube system and especially on the anatomy of <b>sieve</b> <b>plates</b> and <b>sieve</b> <b>plate</b> pores. Several models for phloem translocation have been developed, but appropriate data on the geometry of pores, <b>plates,</b> <b>sieve</b> elements, and flow parameters are lacking. We developed a method to clear cells from cytoplasmic constituents to image cell walls by scanning electron microscopy. This method allows high-resolution measurements of sieve element and <b>sieve</b> <b>plate</b> geometries. <b>Sieve</b> tube–specific conductivity and its reduction by callose deposition after injury was calculated for green bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), bamboo (Phyllostachys nuda), squash (Cucurbita maxima), castor bean (Ricinus communis), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Phloem sap velocity measurements by magnetic resonance imaging velocimetry indicate that higher conductivity is not accompanied by a higher velocity. Studies on the temporal development of callose show that small <b>sieve</b> <b>plate</b> pores might be occluded by callose within minutes, but plants containing sieve tubes with large pores need additional mechanism...|$|R

40|$|During {{maturation}} of sieve {{elements in}} Cucurbita maxima Duchesne, the P-protein bodies (slime bodies) usually disperse in the tonoplast-free cell. In some sieve elements the P-protein bodies fail to disperse. The occurrence of dispersal or nondispersal of P-protein bodies {{can be related}} to the position of the sieve elements in the stem or petiole. In the sieve elements within the vascular bundle the bodies normally disperse; in the extrafascicular sieve elements the bodies often fail to disperse. Extrafascicular sieve elements showing partial dispersal also occur. The appearance of the <b>sieve</b> <b>plate</b> in fixed material is related to the degree of dispersal or nondispersal of the P-protein bodies. In sieve elements in which complete dispersal occurs the <b>sieve</b> <b>plate</b> usually has a substantial deposit of callose, and the sieve-plate pores are filled with P protein. In sieve elements containing nondispersing P-protein bodies the <b>sieve</b> <b>plate</b> bears little or no callose, and its pores usually are essentially "open.

40|$|Arrhenius {{plots of}} {{translocation}} velocity {{as a function}} of petiole temperature show a marked increase in temperature dependence below 10 C in bean (a chilling-sensitive species) but not in sugar beet (chilling-resistant). The increased temperature dependence below 10 C was not observed for cytoplasmic streaming or oxygen uptake in bean. Bean petioles were served to release pressure in order to determine whether sieve tubes are obstructed in cold-treated petioles. The resulting pressure release caused serious displacement of the crystalline protein bodies in the sieve tubes of petioles at 25 C, but in those locally cooled to 0 C for 30 minutes little displacement occurred, indicating obstruction in the latter. An ultrastructural study of sieve tubes in tissue frozen rapidly in situ and dehydrated by freeze substitution revealed that treatment at 0 C for 30 minutes caused structural alteration and displacement of the cytoplasmic material lining the sieve tube wall resulting in occlusion of <b>sieve</b> <b>plates.</b> The <b>sieve</b> <b>plates</b> of the control petioles at 25 C were generally clear of obstructions.

40|$|The ontogenetic {{development}} of the secondary sieve elements in ash, Fraxinus excelsior is traced by using mainly conventional electron microscopy. In addition, negative staining of the exudate and light microscopy have also been used. No major differences from the established trends have been observed in the differentiation of these sieve elements. There {{is evidence that the}} P-protein in the sieve elements originates from helical polysomes found scattered in the dense cytoplasm of young sieve elements. These polysomes also give the appearance of having been derived from rough ER cisternae. Reorganisation of the fibrillar P-protein into the tubular form also seems to take place in the larger P-protein bodies. In negatively-stained preparations, a suggestion of a tightening of the double helix of the P-protein fibrils is discernible. This reorganisation is however not consistent. The usual banding of the fibrillar P-protein is prominent. Most of the mature <b>sieve</b> <b>plates</b> show occluded pores either callosed or not. The P-protein frequently appears to fray out on the downstream side and sometimes on the upstream side as well. This has a bearing on the nature of functioning <b>sieve</b> <b>plates</b> and {{does not seem to be}} due to artifacts. Empty spaces which represent probably a peculiar artifact are observed immediately above most of the mature <b>sieve</b> <b>plates.</b> P-protein seems to pile above these "barrier" spaces while the <b>sieve</b> <b>plates</b> remain occluded with P-protein. Other formations of peculiar interest are the plasmalemmal invaginations ("blebs") found both in the sieve elements and in the parenchyma cells.

Existing photographic techniques for following and recording the droplet behaviour, and for observing the parameters of the pulse and the pulse shape were further developed and improved. A unique illumination technique was developed by which a moving droplet could be photographed using cine or video photography with good contrast without using any dye. Droplet size from a given nozzle and droplet velocity for a given droplet diameter are reduced under pulsing condition, and it was noted that this effect is enhanced in the presence of <b>sieve</b> <b>plate.</b> The droplet breakup processes are well explained by reference to an impact-breakup mechanism.

Numerous reports of hepatotoxin-induced defenestration suggest that the cytoskeleton and the energy status of hepatic endothelial cells {{play a key role in}} the regulation of fenestrae. Therefore, we investigated the effect of antimycin A, an inhibitor of mitochondrial energy production, on the number of fenestrae in cultured LSECs using high-resolution microscopy and immunocytochemistry. Prolonged incubation (greater than 30 min) with antimycin A resulted in defenestrated cells and coincided with the appearance of F-actin dots, whereas the distribution of G-actin remained unchanged. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was depleted dramatically to less than 5 % within 30 minutes within the LSECs. After treatment with antimycin A, unusual elevated fenestrated complexes were apparent, organized as a meshwork of anastomosing fenestrae at the center of and above the <b>sieve</b> <b>plates.</b> The position and appearance of these novel structures and their association with defenestration suggest that they are implicated in the process of defenestration. In conclusion, the results of experiments with antimycin A suggest that ATP is needed to maintain fenestrae and the underlying fenestrae-associated cytoskeleton rings that maintain fenestrae patency.
