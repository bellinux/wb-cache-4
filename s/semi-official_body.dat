40|$|The {{exuberance}} of {{the state}} in France from 1914 to 1918, Fabienne Bock. During the First World War, not only were the institutions of the French republic not shaken — the power {{of the state}} grew over many areas of social and economic life. Industrial and agricultural production, foreign trade, the distribution of the labor force and industrial relations were partially managed by a host of <b>semi-official</b> <b>bodies,</b> commissions, committees or offices which proliferated in relative anarchy. Even if in the 1920 s France was relieved to go back to non intervention and was proud of a degree of désétatisation, the 1914 - 1918 war was an ambiguous stage in the growth of the state apparatus in the twentieth century.

Although the UK was the first Western country to recognize the People's Republic of China, the PRC did not fully recognize the UK until 1972 (see Sino-British relations).|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this study is to treat Jugendpflege first {{organized}} by the state of Prussia in 1911 and to make clear the structure of its Compulsion and Freedom by Focusing on the period 1911 - 1918. The first part {{of this study}} consists of an examination of the mechanism of the organization by the state of youth and its contradiction, that is, to consider the correlation between Compulsion through the state and Freedom in the Jugendpflege. So the writer approaches to it from 3 points of view; a) demand for military preparatory education of youth by the state, b) Jugendpflege as a grant-aid system, c) organization by <b>semi-official</b> <b>bodies</b> of youth bodies. The second is an educational approach to Compulsion and Freedom in the Jugendpflege. Here the writer particularly refers to the 9 th conference of the Zentralstelle fur Volksohlfahrt on the 16 th 17 th, Nov. 1916, which then carried out a series of activities concerning Jugendpflege from the beginning of 20 th century. This paper concludes that the organization by the state of youth used to premise, 2 ̆ 7 Freiwilligkeit 2 ̆ 7 of youth, that Compulsion by the state called for 2 ̆ 7 Freiwilligkeit 2 ̆ 7 of youth without Freedom in the Jugendpflege, and that Jugendpflege, above all the military preparatory education demanded for the compulsory continuiation school...|$|R
40|$|The thesis focuses upon China as {{one example}} of a non-European culture which might merit fuller {{consideration}} in British school curricula. Five principal questions are addressed. First, should Chinese history be taught in schools? Second, has it been neglected hitherto? Third, can the reasons for neglect be identified? Fourth, could Chinese history be taught in schools, and how might it be approached? Fifth, are there adequate resources for teacher and pupil use? All five are answered in the affirmative. Teaching Chinese history is shown to be justified on grounds of intrinsic interest and importance and educational potential. Nonetheless, a study of schoolbooks, history teaching handbooks and reports, theses, journal articles, school inspectoral reports and the recollections of teachers and advisors suggests that Chinese history has suffered serious neglect in schools. The principal reason behind that neglect is shown to be the theory of historical progress, euro- and Anglo-dominated, and concentration in historical education upon the evidence for and narrative detail of that progress, particularly its constitutional and political features, in pursuit of moral and civic education. The influence of major official and <b>semi-official</b> <b>bodies</b> is noted, as is that of the New History movement of recent years. It is suggested, however, that the pattern has also reflected deep-rooted assumptions as to national worth and superiority and acceptance of a range of ethnic, national and racial stereotypes. The role of the popular media is discussed. Foreign influences are considered. With regard to the fourth and fifth questions, it is argued that Chinese history could be introduced to school curricula but that such development demands a broader world-historical framework. In addition, it must capitalise on the move in recent years towards resource-based evidential learning. The importance of the teacher in stressed, and books on Chinese history and civilisation which a non orientalist could draw upon are suggested. Aspects of Chinese history which might be studied in schools, and the relevant adult literature, are considered. Finally, available books and materials suitable for children's use are recommended...|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} factor in this industrial boom (as {{in the development of}} the fisheries) was, remarkably, the regulating role of the Dutch government: guaranteeing product quality gave Dutch products a reputation in foreign markets, that justified slightly higher prices, if need be. Other forms of market regulation, like the monopolies given to the VOC and WIC, but also the <b>semi-official</b> industry <b>bodies</b> that regulated the trade on Russia and the Levant, and the herring industry, helped stabilize market fluctuations. Patent protection helped stimulate industrial innovation. The sophisticated Dutch capital market was stabilized by regulated institutions like the Amsterdam Bank and Exchange, and the regulator of the insurance market. And maybe most importantly, the close connection of the Dutch regents to commercial interests in this period helped shield Dutch industry and commerce from excessive taxation or tariffs. Also, the Dutch government did not hesitate to put its not inconsiderable diplomatic and military might behind Dutch commercial interests, if the need arose to protect them against foreign protectionist measures.|$|R
40|$|In {{the writing}} ·of this history of Saskatoon primary and secondary, {{official}} and unofficial {{sources of information}} were used. The chief primary sources are the official publications and records of federal, provincial and municipal authorities. The Department of the Interior, Ottawa, has {{a complete set of}} files on the business relations of he Temperance Colonization Society with the Dominion Government. Considerable information on the early progress of the community fr 9 m origin up until the winding up of the Temperance Society's affairs {{is to be found in}} the annual reports' of the Inspector of Colonization Companies appearing in the Canadian Sessional Paper [...] The North-West Territory Gazette and its successor, the Saskatchewan Gazette, give essential information concerning the appointment of officials, the erection of school districts and. the rise in municipal status. The information contained in the City of Saskatoon File, Department of Municipal Affairs, Regina is disappointingly meagre prior to 1914. The municipal records are fragmentary-for the period 1901 to 1906 but have been well maintained since the chartering of Saskatoon as a city in 1906. In}addition to official sources there are the records of <b>semi-official</b> <b>bodies,</b> which are in part supported financially by the community. The Board of Trade is one such body. The Minutes of this organization are complete from its inception in 1903. The Records of the Saskatoon Industrial Exhibition, successor to the Central Saskatchewan Agricultural Society, are not complete. The best account of the development of fairs in Saskatoon is contained in The Saskatoon Phenix. The Exhibition-Harvest Edition. August. 1914 Much of the early story of the community ha been recorded in unofficial memoirs of "old-timers. " Personal interviews with officials and private citizens active in civic affair. contributed both tact and colour. The Records of such unofficial bodies a 8 the Saskatoon Trades and Labor Council, the various church bodies, and the local fraternal associations, while incomplete, add further to the pool of information. The various newspapers published in the city constitute a special source. There 1 s a continuous press record since 1902. Periodically, special editions have been devoted to local history and to the stories of early settlers. The secondary sources are not numerous. Little has been published on Saskatoon as a unit though there are some printed sources on various aspects of Saskatoon history. The University has contributed to the knowledge of the geologic formations, the types of land, th& farming practices in the area. There are studies available on wild life in the district,. In addition· to these there are published articles on some institutions in the city and on personalities of the city. This thesis was written as a general history of Saskatoon. Such a study may well be the starting point for further particular studies of institutions or association. within the community. A general local history cannot include all the detailed story of the city. It does,. however, set up a framework of development within which may be traced in broad outline the growth of government, some problems of urban expansion, the increasing dynamic of business, the integration of population and the rise of a civic sense of social responsibility...|$|R
