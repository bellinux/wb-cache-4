40|$|The {{main goal}} of the current {{research}} is to investigate emotional reactions to <b>situations</b> that implicate honor in Turkish and northern American cultural groups. In Studies 1 a and 1 b, participants rated {{the degree to which}} a variety of events fit their prototypes for honor-related <b>situations.</b> Both Turkish and American participants evaluated <b>situations</b> generated by their co-nationals as most central to their prototypes of honor-related <b>situations.</b> Study 2 examined emotional responses to Turkish or U. S. -generated <b>situations</b> that varied in centrality to the prototype. Highly central <b>situations</b> and Turkish-generated <b>situations</b> elicited stronger emotions than less central <b>situations</b> and U. S. -generated <b>situations.</b> Americans reported higher levels of positive emotions in response to honor-enhancing <b>situations</b> than did Turkish participants. These findings demonstrate that the prototypes of honor relevant <b>situations</b> differ for Turkish and northern American people, and that Turkish honor relevant <b>situations</b> are more emotion-laden than are northern American honor relevant <b>situations...</b>|$|R

40|$|The authors {{tested the}} {{hypotheses}} that Turkish and (Northern) American cultures afford different honor-relevant <b>situations</b> and different {{responses to these}} <b>situations.</b> In Study 1, the authors found that honor-attacking <b>situations</b> generated by American participants focused more on the individual than did <b>situations</b> generated by Turkish participants, whereas <b>situations</b> generated by Turkish participants focused more on close others and involved more references to an audience than did <b>situations</b> generated by American participants. Moreover, the <b>situations</b> most frequently generated by both groups tended to also differ in nature. In Study 2, new participants evaluated these <b>situations</b> for {{their impact on the}} self, close others, and acquaintances’ feelings about their family. Turkish participants tended to evaluate <b>situations</b> as having greater impact on all targets than did American participants. Turkish participants also evaluated all <b>situations</b> to have a similar impact on their own feelings and close others’ feelings about themselves, whereas Americans evaluated the <b>situations</b> to have more extreme impact on their own feelings than on the feelings of close others. <b>Situations</b> generated by Turkish participants were evaluated to have stronger impact on all targets...|$|R

40|$|We {{argue that}} {{differences}} between the landscapes of influence <b>situations</b> in Indian and American societies induce Indians to accommodate to others more often than Americans. To investigate cultural differences in situation-scapes, we sampled interpersonal influence <b>situations</b> occurring in India and the United States from both the influencee’s (Study 1) and the influencer’s (Study 2) perspectives. We found that Indian influence <b>situations</b> were dramatically more likely than U. S. <b>situations</b> to feature other-serving motives and to result in positive consequences for the relationship. Yet Study 3 found that targets of influence felt no less free {{to decide whether to}} accommodate in India than the United States, but felt more concerned about the influencer. To investigate the effects of situation-scapes on people’s expectations and decisions, we exposed Indian and American participants to descriptions of <b>situations</b> from both societies (with their origins obscured). Study 4 found that both groups of participants expected more positive consequences from accommodation in Indian <b>situations</b> than in American <b>situations.</b> Finally, Study 5 found that both groups decided to accommodate more often in Indian <b>situations</b> than in American <b>situations.</b> At the same time, Indian participants were more likely than Americans to accommodate across all <b>situations,</b> but both groups converged over 100 trials as they were exposed to more and more <b>situations</b> drawn from each other’s cultures.
