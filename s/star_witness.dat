5|$|Burnside {{was offered}} {{command of the}} Army of the Potomac {{following}} Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's failure in the Peninsula Campaign. He refused this opportunity because of his loyalty to McClellan {{and the fact that}} he understood his own lack of military experience, and detached part of his corps in support of Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia in the Northern Virginia Campaign. He received telegrams at this time from Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter which were extremely critical of Pope's abilities as a commander, and he forwarded on to his superiors in concurrence. This episode later played a significant role in Porter's court-martial, in which Burnside appeared as a <b>star</b> <b>witness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Phoenix Wright, a newly-hired defense {{attorney}} at the Fey and Co. law firm, agrees to represent {{his best friend}} Larry Butz, who {{has been charged with}} the murder of his girlfriend, Cindy Stone. With the help of his boss and mentor, Mia Fey, he proves that Frank Sahwit, the prosecution's <b>star</b> <b>witness,</b> is the real murderer. Shortly thereafter, Mia is killed in her office, and her younger sister Maya is arrested after the police find her name on a note left by Mia. Phoenix takes her case, facing off against Miles Edgeworth, an equally-talented prosecutor. Phoenix manages to identify Redd White, a professional blackmailer, as the real killer, only to find himself charged with the killing instead. Representing himself, he exposes White in court and gets justice for Mia. His reputation established, Phoenix takes on another case, this time defending Will Powers, the lead actor in a children's TV show, against accusations that he killed his co-star, Jack Hammer. In a bizarre twist, it is revealed that Dee Vasquez, the show's producer, committed the murder in self-defense after Hammer tried to kill her and frame Powers for her death.|$|E
25|$|On February 24, 2003, New Jersey state {{prosecutors}} announced Gravano's indictment for {{ordering the}} 1980 murder of NYPD detective Peter Calabro by contract killer Richard Kuklinski.

25|$|By {{pressuring}} one of Blanco's lieutenants, the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office obtained {{sufficient evidence}} to indict Blanco for three murders. However, the case collapsed due to technicalities relating to a telephone-sex scandal between the <b>star</b> <b>witness</b> and female secretaries in the DA's office. In 2004, Blanco {{was released from}} prison and deported to Medellin, Colombia. Before her death in 2012, the last sighting of Blanco was in May 2007 at the Bogota Airport.|$|E
25|$|The <b>star</b> <b>witness</b> {{to appear}} for the {{prosecution}} at the trial of Lawrence Bittaker was Roy Norris, who began his testimony on January 22. Norris testified as to how he became acquainted with Bittaker in jail, and how the pair had formulated a plan to kidnap, rape and kill teenage girls. Responding to questions from the prosecutor, Norris stated that in June 1979, he had unsuccessfully attempted to abduct and rape a woman, who escaped unharmed. When he informed Bittaker of this incident, they both agreed to act together on all future abductions.|$|E

25|$|Jacob Rosenzweig (September 1876 – October 4, 1947) was an American gambler and underworld {{figure in}} New York City. He {{was one of}} several <b>star</b> <b>witnesses</b> in the Becker-Rosenthal trial, among these being fellow gamblers Bridgie Webber, Harry Vallon, and Sam Schepps. Rose's {{testimony}} was the most damaging because he directly implicated Becker in arranging the murder of Herman Rosenthal. As Becker's debt collector, Rose confessed to hiring the Lenox Avenue Gang, providing the getaway car. He testified he did it all on the orders of Charles Becker.|$|R

25|$|The {{trial began}} on February 5, 1923. Day after day the {{prosecution}} called {{a series of}} victims, bilked out of their life savings, to the stand. The <b>star</b> <b>witness,</b> however, was Len Reamey, one of the gang's bookmakers, fourth in the hierarchy behind Blonger, Duff, and bookmaker Jackie French. Reamey provided the inside {{story of how the}} gang defrauded hundreds of victims and divided the spoils among themselves. When the prosecution rested after seven weeks of testimony, the defense attorneys surprised everyone by resting their case without presenting a witness, and further by offering to forgo their closing arguments if the prosecution did the same. Van Cise directed the special prosecutors to call their bluff, and so the case went immediately to the jury without any closing arguments.|$|E
25|$|On March 17, 1994, Stanfa and 23 of his {{men were}} arrested on {{racketeering}} related chargers. This was the second major indictment on the crime family in seven years. The Federal case was the largest prosecution of an organized crime group in Philadelphia history. The second major indictment against the crime family was another strong case for the prosecution. A key piece of evidence was two years of recorded conversations Stanfa would have with mobsters in his attorney's office and doctor's office. Believing attorney–client privilege and doctor-patient confidentiality would protect him, Stanfa openly talked about important Mafia business with his men. However, the FBI {{was able to get}} a warrant to place covert listening devices in both offices once they figured out they were being used to aid criminal conspiracies. The secretly recorded conversations implicated Stanfa and his men of many criminal acts. The <b>star</b> <b>witness</b> at the trial was John Veasey, who was recruited by Stanfa to fight in the war against Merlino and eventually was inducted into the family. Before this, Veasey had no connection to the Mafia or organized crime.|$|E
500|$|Mortimer {{was willing}} to tell all, as Forbes had {{had an affair with}} his wife (which also broke up the Forbes marriage). The {{construction}} executive was the <b>star</b> <b>witness</b> at the hearings in late 1923, after Harding's death. Forbes returned from Europe to testify, but convinced few, and in 1924, he and John W. Thompson, of Thompson–Black, were tried in Chicago for conspiracy to defraud the government. Both were convicted and sentenced to two years in prison. Forbes began to serve his sentence in 1926; Thompson, who had a bad heart, died that year before commencing his. According to Trani and Wilson, [...] "One of the most troublesome aspects of the Harding presidency was that he appeared to be far more concerned with political liabilities of a scandal than in securing justice." ...|$|E

He matriculated to the old University of Chicago, where he graduated with an A.B. in 1875 at the age of sixteen. Joining the staff of the Cincinnati Observatory as an assistant, he worked primarily on computing orbital elements and observing double stars. In 1877, he was awarded his A.M. degree from the University of Cincinnati under Professor Ormond Stone.|$|R

500|$|Testimony was {{introduced}} {{entirely in the}} form of sworn affidavits, the most important of which were deemed classified and presented to the court in camera. [...] The government affiants included classification officers, weapon lab scientists, the Secretaries of Energy, State, and Defense, and Nobel physics laureate Hans Bethe, whom Judge Warren cited as the <b>star</b> <b>witness</b> for the plaintiff. [...] The defense side had no experts with direct knowledge of nuclear weapon design, until the unexpected appearance of Ray Kidder, a nuclear weapon designer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. [...] One of Kidder’s jobs in 1962 had been to evaluate designs of the 29 thermonuclear devices tested in Operation Dominic. [...] Kidder was able to credibly dispute government arguments in the battle of affidavits, leveling the technical playing field. [...] Because of the importance of radiation implosion in civilian fusion research, Kidder had been quietly waging a campaign to declassify it for some years prior to the Progressive case.|$|E
500|$|On May 22, 2015, {{prosecutors}} {{dropped their}} opposition to a new trial. This came largely due to defense claims that the prosecution's <b>star</b> <b>witness,</b> Armando Morales, had perjured himself on the stand. [...] The defense contended that prosecutors failed to disclose that Morales was a jailhouse informant {{with a reputation for}} being untrustworthy. [...] Morales had denied ever being an informant. [...] The defense also argued that Morales made up Guandique's confession in order to boost his stock with prosecutors. [...] On June 3, 2015, the defense said a new witness, a neighbor, called 911 at 4:37a.m. on the last day Levy was alive to report hearing a 'blood-curdling scream', possibly coming from Levy's apartment. On June 4, 2015, Judge Gerald Fisher granted a motion for the new trial. Guandique's attorneys suggested that Morales fabricated Guandique's confession to gain favor with law enforcement. On June 12, 2015, Judge Robert E. Morin set the retrial of Guandique for March 1, 2016 but in March, the trial date was moved to October 11, 2016.|$|E

[...] Because Kate is opposed to bringing her son into the trial, Jack is called in as a character witness. [...] He lies in his testimony, saying that Flight 815 crashed in the water, eight survived the crash, but two have since died and Kate was primarily responsible for the Oceanic Six's survival. [...] Kate speaks with her mother Diane Janssen (Beth Broderick) {{for the first time in}} four years. [...] Diane is no longer angry at Kate because her perspective changed when she thought that Kate had died in the plane crash. [...] When Diane, the prosecution's <b>star</b> <b>witness,</b> no longer wants to testify against her daughter, the District Attorney makes a plea deal: Kate gets ten years probation, but must stay in the state of California. [...] Jack meets Kate in the parking garage. He admits that he still loves her (in contrast to his false testimony under oath on her behalf) and asks to go out for coffee with her.

500|$|The {{obscenity}} {{trial began}} on 9 November 1928. Cape's solicitor Harold Rubinstein sent out 160 letters to potential witnesses. Many {{were reluctant to}} appear in court; according to Virginia Woolf, [...] "they generally put {{it down to the}} weak heart of a father, or a cousin who is about to have twins". About 40 turned up {{on the day of the}} trial, including Woolf herself, Forster, and such diverse figures as biologist Julian Huxley, Laurence Housman of the British Sexological Society, Robert Cust JP of the London Morality Council, Charles Ricketts of the Royal Academy of Art and Rabbi Joseph Frederick Stern of the East London Synagogue. Norman Haire, who was the <b>star</b> <b>witness</b> after Havelock Ellis bowed out, declared that homosexuality ran in families and a person could no more become it by reading books than if he could become syphilitic by reading about syphilis. None were allowed to offer their views of the novel. Under the Obscene Publications Act of 1857, Chief Magistrate Sir Chartres Biron could decide whether the book was obscene without hearing any testimony on the question. [...] "I don't think people are entitled to express an opinion upon a matter which is the decision of the court," [...] he said. Since Hall herself was not on trial, she did not have the right to her own counsel, and Cape's barrister Norman Birkett had persuaded her not to take the stand herself.|$|E
500|$|Robson {{appeared}} on The Today Show on May 16, 2013, {{to discuss the}} allegations.

In a 1993 deposition Robson's mother, Joy Robson, said that Jackson had [...] "special friends", boys with whom he spent extra time with that he replaced each year, and that Wade was Jackson's [...] "special friend" [...] in 1990. In August 1993, after the allegations against Jackson were made public, Wade Robson and Jackson's other [...] "special friend", Brett Barnes, held a press conference in which they stated that they had slept in Jackson's bed but nothing sexual had occurred. Robson said in the Today Show interview that his denial of wrongdoing on Jackson's part during the 1993 investigation was a result of Jackson's [...] "complete manipulation and brainwashing" [...] of him. Robson alleged that at the time Jackson [...] "would call me every day and role play and tell me the same sort of things and also tell me then that if anyone ever thought that we did these things, any of these sexual things, that both of us would go to jail {{for the rest of our}} lives." [...] Robson was also a <b>star</b> <b>witness</b> for Jackson's defense at his 2005 trial.
