30|$|A silver {{nanoparticle}} {{solution was}} prepared in one step by mixing AgNO 3 and <b>a</b> <b>multi-amino</b> compound (RSD-NH 2) solution under ambient condition. RSD-NH 2 was in-house synthesized by methacrylate and polyethylene polyamine in methanol, which has abundant amino and imino groups. However, {{the characterization of}} silver nanoparticles indicated that these nanoparticles are easy to agglomerate in solution. Therefore, an in situ synthesis method of silver nanoparticles on the silk fabrics was developed. The examined results confirmed that the in situ synthesized silver nanoparticles were evenly distributed {{on the surface of}} fibers. The inhibition zone test and the antibacterial rate demonstrated that the finished fabrics have an excellent antibacterial property against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Moreover, the nanosilver-treated silk fabrics were laundered 0, 5, 10, 20, and 50 times and still retained the exceptional antibacterial property. When the treated fabrics were washed 50 times, the antibacterial rate is more than 97.43 % for S. aureus and 99.86 % for E. coli. The excellent laundering durability may be attributed to the tight binding between silver nanoparticles and silk fibers through the in situ synthesis. This method provides an economic method to enhance the antibacterial capability of silk fabrics with good resistance to washings.|$|R

The experimental {{results show that}} various preparation parameters including surfactant ratio of Tween 80 to Span 80, surfactant concentration, benzyl alcohol in the external water phase, and polymer concentration had obvious effects on the particle size, morphology, and encapsulation efficiency of the BSA-loaded microspheres. The sizes of BSA-loaded microspheres ranged from 60. 2 µm to 79. 7 µm, showing different degrees of porous structure. The encapsulation efficiency of BSA-loaded microspheres also ranged from 38. 8 % to 50. 8 %. BSA release from microspheres showed the classic biphasic profile, which was governed by diffusion and polymer erosion. The initial burst release of BSA from microspheres at the first week followed by constant slow release for the next 7 weeks were observed. BSA-loaded microspheres could degrade gradually in phosphate buffered saline buffer with pH value maintained at around 7. 1 during 8 weeks incubation, suggesting that microsphere degradation did not cause a dramatic pH drop in phosphate buffered saline buffer because no acidic degradation products were released from the microspheres. Therefore, the MAC microspheres might have great potential as carriers for protein delivery. Keywords: poly (amino acid) copolymer, release, degradatio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we define {{a class of}} graph grammars {{that can be used}} to model and direct {{concurrent}} robotic selfassembly and similar self-organizing processes. We give several detailed examples of the formalism and then focus on the problem of <b>synthesizing</b> <b>a</b> grammar so that it generates a given, prespecified assembly. In particular, to generate an acyclic graph we <b>synthesize</b> <b>a</b> binary grammar (rules involve at most two parts), and for a general graph we <b>synthesize</b> <b>a</b> ternary grammar (rules involve at most three parts). In both cases, we characterize the number of concurrent steps required to achieve the assembly. We also show a general result that implies that no binary grammar can generate a unique stable assembly. We conclude the paper with a discussion of how graph grammars can be used to direct the self-assembly of robotic parts. I...|$|R
