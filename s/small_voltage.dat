25|$|If the {{mechanical}} regulator design {{is sensitive to}} <b>small</b> <b>voltage</b> fluctuations, {{the motion of the}} solenoid core can be used to move a selector switch across a range of resistances or transformer windings to gradually step the output voltage up or down, or to rotate the position of a moving-coil AC regulator.|$|E
25|$|Because {{comparators}} {{have only}} two output states, their outputs are near zero or near the supply voltage. Bipolar rail-to-rail comparators have a common-emitter output that produces a <b>small</b> <b>voltage</b> drop between the output and each rail. That drop {{is equal to the}} collector-to-emitter voltage of a saturated transistor. When output currents are light, output voltages of CMOS rail-to-rail comparators, which rely on a saturated MOSFET, range closer to the rails than their bipolar counterparts.|$|E

We demonstrate that in the ballistic limit (D ≃ 1), the crossover between the quasistationary evolution of the Josephson phase difference ϕ at <b>small</b> <b>voltages</b> and transport by multiple Andreev reflections at larger voltages can be described as the Landau-Zener transition induced by finite reflection in the channel.

25|$|When {{there is}} an uneven {{distribution}} of cations and anions, {{there will be a}} <b>small</b> <b>voltage</b> called half-cell potential associated with the current. In the DC system that is used by the ECG and EEG instruments, the difference between the half-cell potential and the zero potential is shown as DC offset which is an undesirable characteristic. Silver/silver chloride is a popular choice of biological electrodes due to its low half-cell potential of approximately 220 mV and the lower of the impedance of the electrode by silver chloride.|$|E
25|$|The above effects often {{combine to}} cause {{non-linear}} effects within capacitors. For example, dielectric absorption {{refers to the}} inability of a capacitor that has been charged {{for a long time}} to completely discharge when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would remain at zero volts after being discharged, real capacitors will develop a <b>small</b> <b>voltage,</b> a phenomenon that is also called soakage or battery action. For some dielectrics, such as many polymer films, the resulting voltage may be less than 1–2% of the original voltage. However, it can be as much as 15–25% in the case of electrolytic capacitors or supercapacitors.|$|E
25|$|As the {{membrane}} potential is increased, sodium ion channels open, allowing {{the entry of}} sodium ions into the cell. This {{is followed by the}} opening of potassium ion channels that permit the exit of potassium ions from the cell. The inward flow of sodium ions increases the concentration of positively charged cations in the cell and causes depolarization, where the potential of the cell is higher than the cell's resting potential. The sodium channels close {{at the peak of the}} action potential, while potassium continues to leave the cell. The efflux of potassium ions decreases {{the membrane}} potential or hyperpolarizes the cell. For <b>small</b> <b>voltage</b> increases from rest, the potassium current exceeds the sodium current and the voltage returns to its normal resting value, typically −70mV. However, if the voltage increases past a critical threshold, typically 15mV higher than the resting value, the sodium current dominates. This results in a runaway condition whereby the positive feedback from the sodium current activates even more sodium channels. Thus, the cell fires, producing an action potential. The frequency at which cellular action potentials are produced is known as its firing rate.|$|E

2500|$|A {{comparator}} normally {{changes its}} output state when the voltage between its inputs crosses through approximately zero volts. <b>Small</b> <b>voltage</b> fluctuations due to noise, always {{present on the}} inputs, can cause undesirable rapid changes between the two output states when the input voltage difference is near zero volts.

In order to prevent shocks, most very large capacitors are shipped with shorting wires that need to be removed before they are used.|$|E
2500|$|The {{voltage pulse}} {{produced}} by the detector (or by the photomultiplier in a scintillation counter) is shaped by a multichannel analyzer (MCA). The multichannel analyzer takes the very <b>small</b> <b>voltage</b> signal {{produced by the}} detector, reshapes it into a Gaussian or trapezoidal shape, and converts that signal into a digital signal. In some systems, the analog-to-digital conversion is performed before the peak is reshaped. The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) also sorts the pulses by their height. ADCs have specific numbers of [...] "bins" [...] into which the pulses can be sorted; these bins represent the channels in the spectrum. The number of channels can be changed in most modern gamma spectroscopy systems by modifying software or hardware settings. The number of channels is typically a power of two; common values include 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, or 16384 channels. The choice of number of channels depends on {{the resolution of the}} system and the energy range being studied.|$|E

2500|$|One of E-meter's primary {{components}} is a Wheatstone bridge, {{an electrical}} circuit configuration invented in 1833 {{that enables the}} detection of very small differences between two electrical impedances (in this case, resistance). The E-meter is constructed so that one resistance is the subject's body {{and the other is}} a rheostat controlled by the operator. A <b>small</b> <b>voltage</b> from the battery is applied to electrodes held in the subjects hands. As the electrical properties (electrodermal activity) of the subject's body changes during the counseling, the resulting changes in the small electric current are displayed in needle movements on a large analog panel meter.

Each time after the particles pass to the other dee electrode the polarity of the RF voltage reverses. Therefore, each time the particles cross the gap from one dee electrode to the other, the electric field is in the correct direction to accelerate them. The particles' increasing speed due to these pushes causes them to move in a larger radius circle with each rotation, so the particles move in a spiral path outward from the center to {{the rim of the}} dees. When they reach the rim a <b>small</b> <b>voltage</b> on a metal plate deflects the beam so it exits the dees through a small gap between them, and hits a target located at the exit point at the rim of the chamber, or leaves the cyclotron through an evacuated beam tube to hit a remote target.

40|$|AbstractIon {{conduction}} through microscopic channels is {{of central}} importance in both biology and nanotechnology. To {{better understand the}} current-voltage (I-V) dependence of ion channels, here we describe and prove a collective diffusion model that quantitatively relates the spontaneous ion permeation at equilibrium to the stationary ionic fluxes driven by <b>small</b> <b>voltages.</b> The model {{makes it possible to}} determine the channel conductance in the linear I-V range from equilibrium simulations without the application of a voltage. To validate the theory, we perform molecular-dynamics simulations on two channels—a conical-shaped nanopore and the transmembrane pore of an α-hemolysin—under both equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. The simulations reveal substantial couplings between the motions of cations and anions, which are effectively captured by the collective coordinate in the model. Although the two channels exhibit very different linear ranges in the I-V curves, in both cases the channel conductance at <b>small</b> <b>voltages</b> is in reasonable agreement with the prediction from the equilibrium simulation. The simulations also suggest that channel charges, rather than geometric asymmetry, play a more prominent role in current rectification...|$|R
