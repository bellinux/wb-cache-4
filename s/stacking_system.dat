5000|$|Sherry is then aged in the solera {{system where}} new wine {{is put into}} wine barrels at the {{beginning}} of a series of three to nine barrels. Periodically, a portion of the wine in a barrel is moved into the next barrel down, using tools called the canoa (canoe) and rociador (sprinkler) to move the wine gently and avoid damaging the layer of flor in each barrel. At the end of the series only a portion of the final barrel is bottled and sold. Depending on the type of wine, the portion moved may be between five and thirty percent of each barrel. This process is called [...] "running the scales" [...] because each barrel in the series is called a scale. Thus, the age of the youngest wine going in the bottle is determined by the number of barrels in the series, and every bottle also contains some much older wine than is stated. Sherry is aged in the solera for a minimum of three years. A large solera system may consist of scales that require more than one barrel to hold. The word 'solera' means 'on the ground'; this refers to the <b>stacking</b> <b>system</b> that was, and sometimes still is, used, with the youngest barrels at the top and the oldest scale, also somewhat ambiguously called 'the solera', at the bottom. Of late, Sherry producers and marketers have been bottling their wines en rama, with only a light filtration, and often a selection of a favored barrel from a larger solera. Such sherries can be considerably more complex in flavor than the standard bottlings, and, according to many, are worth seeking out. In order to allow the sale of reliable average age-dated sherries, the regulating council has set up a system that accurately tracks the average age of the wines as they move through their solera. Two average age-dated categories are recognized: VOS ('Vinum Optimum Signatum'-20 years old average age minimum) and VORS ('Vinum Optimum Rare Signatum'-30 years old average age minimum).|$|E
5000|$|Preparation for {{construction}} commenced in 2007 with the clearance of all structures on site and reconfiguration of a pedestrian bridge towards The Mailbox. Bachy Soletanche Limited (BSL), led by Project Manager Chris Wallbank, then {{set to work}} creating a perimeter retaining wall around the site to prevent ground movement whilst the foundations were being constructed. A large diameter auger piling technique was used to install 226, 900 mm diameter piles at 1050 mm spacings and to depths of 24 m. BSL skipped three piles - after installing the first pile - to avoid concrete flowing into the next borehole and therefore damaging the original pile. Due {{to the presence of}} groundwater when the piles were bored, a Tremie pipe was used which displaced water to the surface as the bore hole was filled with concrete. At the southwest corner of the site, where the automated car <b>stacking</b> <b>system</b> was to be installed, BSL removed the large diameter auger piles and replaced them with 24Nr, 273 mm diameter minipiles bored to a depth of 24 m. Along the western boundary of the site, a further 54 minipiles were installed to a depth of 12 m to provide further support Washington Wharf, an adjacent apartment building. BSL then constructed 30 king post piles to provide the foundation for a temporary ramp which was required for future building works. Each king post pile was formed in a 900 mm diameter pile, with a 400 mm square steel column concreted into the toe of the pile. These piles ran in two parallel rows down the centre of the site from Commercial Street.With all the initial piling works complete, excavation commenced on site by local firm O'Donnell, who had to test various ramp gradients at one of their sites before starting work at the Cube. The optimum gradient for lorries transporting earth from a hill start was recreated at the site, with the surface of the temporary ramp up to Commercial Street being maintained in a coarse condition to give sufficient grip for vehicles entering and leaving the site. A total of [...] of earth and sandstone was removed from the site. Once this had been completed, BSL returned to construct 12 temporary anchors to hold back the retaining piles {{on the east side of}} the site. BSL completed the piling project at the end of 2007.|$|E

Methods: We compared two differing flexible URS set-ups. The first was our normal completely digital fixed set-up, comprising a flexible ureteroscope and matching digital <b>stack</b> <b>system</b> (CLV-S 40 PRO- 6 E, Olympus). The second set-up comprised the same digital ureteroscope but with a conventional non-digital <b>stack</b> <b>system</b> and the OTV-SI portable light source. Seven experienced urologists were asked to subjectively assess {{the quality of the}} video sequences with the naked eye. The image qualities assessed were as follows: colour, distortion, graininess, depth perception, contrast, and glare. Finally, they were asked to guess whether they were observing images from the normal fixed set-up or the portable set-up. Fisherâ€™s exact test was used to compare the two sets of nominal variables. Results: There {{were no significant differences in}} the observation ratings between the fixed and portable systems, independent of observer or image settings.

40|$|In this research, wafer-level {{flexible}} input/output interconnection technologies, Mechanically Flexible Interconnects (MFIs), {{have been}} developed. First, Au-NiW MFIs with 65 Âµm vertical elastic {{range of motion}} are designed and fabricated. The gold passivation layer is experimentally verified to not only lower the electrical resistance but also significantly extend the life-time of the MFIs. In addition, a photoresist spray-coating based fabrication process is developed to scale the in-line pitch of MFIs from 150 Âµm to 50 Âµm. By adding a contact-tip, Au-NiW MFI could realize a rematable assembly on a substrate with uniform pads and a robust assembly on a substrate with 45 Âµm surface variation. Last but not least, multi-pitch multi-height MFIs (MPMH MFIs) are formed using double-lithography and double-reflow processes, which can realize an MFI array containing MFIs with various heights and various pitches. Using these advanced MFIs, large scale heterogeneous systems which can provide high performance system-level interconnections are demonstrated. For example, the demonstrated 3 D interposer stacking enabled by MPMH MFIs is promising to realize a low profile and cavity-free robust <b>stacking</b> <b>system.</b> Moreover, bridged multiinterposer system is developed to address the reticle and yield limitations of realizing a large scale system using current 2. 5 D integration technologies.

40|$|Context: The {{workload}} at seaport {{container terminal}} is increasing gradually. We {{need to improve}} the performance of terminal to fulfill the demand. The key section of the container terminal is container stacking yard which {{is an integral part}} of the seaside and the landside. So its performance has the effects on both sides. The main problem in this area is unproductive moves of containers. However, we need a well-planned stacking area in order to increase the performance of terminal and maximum utilization of existing resources. Objectives: In this work, we have analyzed the existing container <b>stacking</b> <b>system</b> at Helsingborg seaport container terminal, Sweden, investigated the already provided solutions of the problem and find the best optimization technique to get the best possible solution. After this, suggest the solution, test the proposed solution and analyzed the simulation based results with respect to the desired solution. Methods: To identify the problem, methods and proposed solutions of the given problem in the domain of container stacking yard management, a literature review has been conducted by using some e-resources/databases. A GA with best parametric values is used to get the best optimize solution. A discrete event simulation model for container stacking in the yard has been build and integrated with genetic algorithm. A proposed mathematical model to show the dependency of cost minimization on the number of containersâ€™ moves. Results: The GA has been achieved the high fitness value versus generations for 150 containers to storage at best location in a block with 3 tier levels and to minimize the unproductive moves in the yard. A comparison between Genetic Algorithm and Tabu Search has been made to verify that the GA has performed better than other algorithm or not. A simulation model with GA has been used to get the simulation based results and to show the container handling by using resources like AGVs, yard crane and delivery trucks and container stacking and retrieval system in the yard. The container stacking cost is directly proportional to the number of moves has been shown by the mathematical model. Conclusions: We have identified the key factor (unproductive moves) that is the base of other key factors (time & cost) and has an effect on the performance of the stacking yard and overall the whole seaport terminal. We have focused on this drawback of <b>stacking</b> <b>system</b> and proposed a solution that makes this system more efficient. Through this, we can save time and cost both.

40|$|Abstract. Although various designs {{have been}} {{introduced}} to improve {{the performance of a}} Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) <b>stack</b> <b>system,</b> fault conditions, such as drying or flooding, may still occur due to the complexity of the process.
