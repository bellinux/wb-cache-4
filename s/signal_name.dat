5000|$|In May 2016, Signal's lead {{developer}} Moxie Marlinspike {{requested that}} LibreSignal, a fork that had removed the GCM dependency, {{not use the}} Signal servers or the <b>Signal</b> <b>name.</b> As a result, on 24 May 2016 the LibreSignal project posted that the project was [...] "abandoned".|$|E
5000|$|Another common way {{to write}} edge-triggered {{behavior}} in VHDL {{is with the}} 'event' signal attribute. A single apostrophe has to be written between the <b>signal</b> <b>name</b> {{and the name of}} the attribute.DFF : process(RST, CLK) isbegin if RST = '1' then Q <= '0'; elsif CLK'event and CLK = '1' then Q <= D; end if;end process DFF; ...|$|E
50|$|This routing {{problem is}} {{equivalent}} to the travelling salesman problem, which is NP complete, and therefore not amenable to a perfect solution in a reasonable time. One practical routing algorithm is to pick the pin farthest {{from the center of the}} board, then use a greedy algorithm to select the next-nearest unrouted pin with the same <b>signal</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E
50|$|Therefore, a {{nameplate}} H 1/2 means a <b>signal</b> <b>named</b> H {{that aside}} S1 will also display S2-S5 aspects for straight direction and S10-S13 for diverging direction. Whereas P3 2 means a <b>signal</b> of <b>name</b> P3 that aside S1 only displays S10-S13 aspects {{because it is}} only followed by diverging direction.|$|R
50|$|Symbolic <b>signal</b> <b>names</b> {{are used}} because signal numbers can vary across platforms, but XSI-conformant systems allow {{the use of}} the numeric {{constant}} 1 to be used to indicate a SIGHUP, which the vast majority of systems in fact use.|$|R

5000|$|CAD for wire-wrap {{requires}} that a schematic be encoded into a netlist. A netlist is conceptually {{a list of}} pins that should be connected, with an associated <b>signal</b> <b>name</b> for all the pins that touch the signal. Often done by hand in older systems, this step is now done automatically by EDA programs that perform [...] "schematic capture." [...] Manual annotation is usually still required for special signals, such as high-speed, high current or noise-sensitive circuits, or special construction techniques such as twisted pairs or special routing. Annotations are encoded {{in a field of}} each record of the net list.|$|E
5000|$|Every D-Bus message {{consists}} of a header and a body. The header is formed by several fields that identifies the type of message, the sender, {{as well as information}} required to deliver the message to its recipient (destination bus name, object path, method or <b>signal</b> <b>name,</b> interface name, etc.). The body contains the data payload that the receiver process interprets [...] - for instance the input or output arguments. All the data is encoded in a well known binary format called the wire format which supports the serialization of various types, such as integers and floating-point numbers, strings, compound types, and so on, also referred to as [...] marshaling.|$|E

40|$|Quicklist, a {{preprocessor}} for {{an existing}} wire list program that cuts {{the description of}} the wire list by about 67 percent over previous methods, is described. Quicklist uses two different methods to shorten the input data. The first of these is the use of parentheses to allow a compact way of describing <b>signal</b> <b>names</b> which increment (or decrement) by one, i. e., typical <b>signal</b> <b>names</b> in a bus. The other method used is the equal sign. Using this symbol in a signal list says {{that the rest of the}} signals on that chip are the same as those on the previous chip described. Quicklist is intended to be the basis of a computer aided logic design system...|$|R

50|$|Similarly, if {{the process}} {{attempted}} to access a memory address outside of its virtual address space, the kernel would notify {{the process of}} this violation via a SIGSEGV signal. The exact mapping between <b>signal</b> <b>names</b> and exceptions is obviously dependent upon the CPU, since exception types differ between architectures.|$|R
40|$|VML (Virtual Machine Language) is an {{advanced}} computing environment that allows spacecraft to operate using mechanisms ranging from simple, time-oriented sequencing to advanced, multicomponent reactive systems. VML has developed in four evolutionary stages. VML 0 is a core execution capability providing multi-threaded command execution, integer data types, and rudimentary branching. VML 1 added named parameterized procedures, extensive polymorphism, data typing, branching, looping issuance of commands using run-time parameters, and named global variables. VML 2 added for loops, data verification, telemetry reaction, {{and an open}} flight adaptation architecture. VML 2. 1 contains major advances in control flow capabilities for executable state machines. On the resource requirements front, VML 2. 1 features a reduced memory footprint in order to fit more capability into modestly sized flight processors, and endian-neutral data access for compatibility with Intel little-endian processors. Sequence packaging has been improved with object-oriented programming constructs {{and the use of}} implicit (rather than explicit) time tags on statements. Sequence event detection has been significantly enhanced with multi-variable waiting, which allows a sequence to detect and react to conditions defined by complex expressions with multiple global variables. This multi-variable waiting serves as the basis for implementing parallel rule checking, which in turn, makes possible executable state machines. The new state machine feature in VML 2. 1 allows the creation of sophisticated autonomous reactive systems without the need to develop expensive flight software. Users specify named states and transitions, along with the truth conditions required, before taking transitions. Transitions with the same <b>signal</b> <b>name</b> allow separate state machines to coordinate actions: the conditions distributed across all state machines necessary to arm a particular signal are evaluated, and once found true, that signal is raised. The selected signal then causes all identically named transitions in all present state machines to be taken simultaneously. VML 2. 1 has relevance to all potential space missions, both manned and unmanned. It was under consideration for use on Orion...|$|E

50|$|On 15 June 2016, the LIGO group {{announced}} an observation of another gravitational wave <b>signal,</b> <b>named</b> GW151226. The Advanced LIGO {{is predicted to}} detect five more black hole mergers like GW150914 in its next observing campaign, and then 40 binary star mergers each year, {{in addition to an}} unknown number of more exotic gravitational wave sources, some of which may not be anticipated by current theory.|$|R
50|$|At the {{operating}} system level, this fault is caught and a signal is {{passed on to the}} offending process, activating the process's handler for that signal. Different operating systems have different <b>signal</b> <b>names</b> to indicate that a segmentation fault has occurred. On Unix-like operating systems, a signal called SIGSEGV (abbreviated from segmentation violation) is sent to the offending process. On Microsoft Windows, the offending process receives a STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION exception.|$|R

30|$|A {{technique}} of extraction [15] allows us, following 800 acquisitions such as described before, the visualization of the BAEP estimation on averages of 16 acquisitions. Thus, a surface of 50 estimations called Temporal Dynamic of the Cerebral trunk (TDC) can be visualized. The average signal, which {{corresponds to the}} average of the 800 acquisitions, and the TDC surface could then be obtained. Those are then processed into a signal representation as shown in Fig.  3 b. In this figure, an example of TDC surface for a patient is shown.

30|$|The {{distinction}} is the wellspring {{of the data}} to the estimator (Xiong 2006). In the PA channel estimation, the pilot <b>signals</b> <b>named</b> introductions or pilot subcarriers are transmitted occasionally crosswise over time or frequency pivot. With the learning of the pilots, the receiver can extricate the channel data for the committed time and subcarriers. In the wake of applying different interjection strategies, the channel gauges for particular time and subcarrier can be acquired.|$|R
