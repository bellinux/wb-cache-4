25|$|Aspect {{is unusual}} in ASL in that {{transitive}} verbs derived for aspect lose their transitivity. That is, while you can sign 'dog chew bone' for the dog chewed on a bone, or 'she look-at me' for she looked at me, you cannot {{do the same in}} the durative to mean the dog gnawed on the bone or <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> at me. Instead, you must use other strategies, such as a topic construction (see below) to avoid having an object for the verb.|$|E
