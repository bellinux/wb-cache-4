2500|$|St. Damasus <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chair</b> of St. Peter for {{eighteen}} years and two months. His feast day is 11 December. [...] He was buried beside {{his mother and}} sister in a [...] "funerary basilica ... somewhere between the Via Appia and Via Ardeatina", {{the exact location of}} which is lost.|$|E
2500|$|Ward {{served on}} several {{important}} committees, including the Committee on Secrets and frequently <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> when the Congress met as {{a committee of}} the whole. [...] He devoted all of his energy to the Continental Congress, until his untimely death from smallpox {{at a meeting of}} the convention in Philadelphia. Ward died a little more than three months before the Declaration of Independence was signed. [...] He was originally buried in Philadelphia, but in 1860 was reinterred in the Common Burying Ground in Newport, Rhode Island.|$|E
60|$|She watched him, watched. And he <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> {{near the}} door, without moving.|$|E
50|$|Eye wa haama motjihavero otjinenenene. He/She <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> biggest <b>chair.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Arizonans were {{planning}} to protest Arizona SB 1070 by not carrying their identification papers. Also that year, five protestors pleaded guilty to trespassing after they <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> of <b>the</b> Greensboro, North Carolina city council during a recess, banged the gavel, and denounced a subculture of police corruption.|$|R
60|$|She <b>sat</b> up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> {{and looked}} at him with quivering lips.|$|R
6000|$|She drew an arm round my neck, {{and drew}} my head close down to hers as she <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b> [...] "Love her, love her, love her! How does she use you?" ...|$|E
60|$|When Duane {{returned}} to the sitting-room Colonel Longstreth was absent, also several of the other passengers. Miss Ruth <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> he had vacated, and {{across the table from}} her sat Miss Longstreth. Duane went directly to them.|$|E
60|$|Corey {{made his}} way to the girl's {{presence}} with open trepidation, which was not allayed by her silence and languor. She <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> where she had sat the other night, but she was not playing with a fan now.|$|E
60|$|She <b>sat</b> up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b> Julien {{had known}} well how to rouse her.|$|R
60|$|She <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> by <b>the</b> fire, where <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{old days}} she had nursed them.|$|R
60|$|Kirk <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> she {{had left}} and looked at Bill. He felt choked. There was a mist before his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Presently the {{violence}} of her sobbing diminished and she <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> exhausted, with her head thrown back and her arms hanging by her side. She had the grotesque look {{of one of those}} painters' dummies used to hang draperies on.|$|E
6000|$|And Herbert again <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> and {{his mother}} crouched, or almost kneeled, on the cushion at his knee. [...] "Dearest, dearest, dearest mother," [...] he said, as he {{supported}} her head against his shoulder, [...] "we must love each other {{now more than ever}} we have loved." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Merrill, too, had {{something}} on his mind, and did not quite know how to go on. There was in William Wetherell, as he <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> with {{his eyes fixed on}} his visitor's face, a dignity which Mr. Merrill had not seen before--had not thought the man might possess.|$|E
50|$|One year later, he {{once again}} <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> director’s <b>chair</b> and {{directed}} <b>the</b> short documentary film Tichá Vášeň (English title - Silent Passion).|$|R
60|$|Mrs. March had judged it decorous {{for her to}} say nothing, but she now {{went and}} <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> next her husband.|$|R
60|$|Grandfather {{proceeded}} to speak further of Roger Williams, and of other persons who <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> great <b>chair,</b> {{as will be}} seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following chapter.|$|R
6000|$|... "The chair," [...] {{proceeded}} Grandfather, [...] "was now continually {{occupied by}} some of the high tories, as the king’s friends were called, who frequented the British Coffee House. Officers of the custom-house, too, which stood {{on the opposite side of}} King Street, often <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> wagging their tongues against John Hancock." ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> beside her, leaning forward, {{his hands}} hanging like two scarlet flowers {{listless}} {{in the fire}} glow, near to her, as she knelt on the hearth, with head bowed down. One of the flowers awoke and spread towards her. It asked for her mutely. She was fascinated, scarcely able to move.|$|E
60|$|Madeline in {{collapse}} {{was another}} {{woman to the}} mischievous creature of an hour before, whose laughter had been so infectious and whose heightened color and flashing eyes had made her teachers for the while forget. Weak and nerveless, she <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> {{just as she had}} been dropped there by Prince and Harrington.|$|E
60|$|And she <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b> It {{was evident}} {{she had come}} for a last talk. Ursula, not knowing what she wanted, waited in silence.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' she said. Then {{she turned}} her wonderful, {{forget-me-not}} blue eyes up to her son, as she slowly <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> he had brought her.|$|R
60|$|Dan <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> as he spoke, and {{his sister}} Jessie, who entered at the moment, pushed him all about {{the room with the}} {{greatest}} ease.|$|R
6000|$|... "The chair," [...] {{proceeded}} Grandfather, [...] "was now continually {{occupied by}} some of the high tories, as the king's friends were called, who frequented the British Coffee House. Officers of the Custom House, too, which stood {{on the opposite side of}} King Street, often <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> wagging their tongues against John Hancock." ...|$|E
60|$|The tavern dining-room {{had been}} cleared of all its {{furniture}} save one six-foot pine table and a chair. This table was against {{one end of the}} room; the chair was on it; Sherlock Holmes, stately, imposing, impressive, <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b> The public stood. The room was full. The tobacco-smoke was dense, the stillness profound.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--yes--but such a man! Mrs. Vimpany, he {{was present}} when the Dane was poisoned. He {{knew that the}} man was poisoned. He <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> his face white, and he said nothing. Oh! It was as much as I could do not to rush out and dash the glass from his hands. Lord Harry said nothing." ...|$|E
60|$|Agatha <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> that he {{drew out}} for her near the stove. He noticed that {{she glanced at the}} papers on the table, and he laughed.|$|R
50|$|The princess had herself {{chosen the}} biblical texts which Handel set to music <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anthem. It is a festive piece with double choruses, i.e., the choral writing is for eight parts {{rather than the}} usual four. During the wedding service, while the {{performance}} of Handel's anthem was taking place there were no processions or ceremonies or other activities happening; the order of service indicated {{this was the only}} time the princess and her bridegroom <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> provided for them. They and everyone else present gave Handel's music their full attention.|$|R
60|$|That {{evening after}} dinner, as Mr. Merrick <b>sat</b> alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hotel lobby, the girls having gone {{to watch the}} Major bowl tenpins, Mr. Jones {{approached}} and <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> beside him.|$|R
60|$|Eddie Shorter had <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> as Barbara and Billy {{had last}} seen him waiting until Byrne should have an ample start before arousing Grayson and {{reporting}} the prisoner's escape. Eddie had determined that he would give Billy an hour. He grinned as he anticipated the rage of Grayson and the Villistas when they learned that their bird had flown, and as he mused and waited he fell asleep.|$|E
6000|$|He {{pressed a}} switch. The {{projector}} whirred, {{and on the}} far wall a three-dimensional image appeared in color, so real that {{it might have been the}} man himself. Robert Bradshaw was a man of fifty, heavy-set, with iron grey hair and a square jaw. He <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> calmly, his hands resting on the arms, oblivious to the electrodes attached to his neck and wrist. [...] "There I go," [...] Harris said. [...] "Watch." ...|$|E
6000|$|Almost {{fiercely}} she had spoken, {{and with}} a warning gesture she hurried from the room, leaving the young man feeling as if a sudden thunder-gust had swept through the house. For several minutes he <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> she left, thinking deeply. Suddenly he rose, went to his sister, and said, in his usual tone of indolent good nature, [...] "Bella, didn't I hear Ned ask you to be kind to Miss Muir?" ...|$|E
60|$|Agatha <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> he {{drew out}} for her near the stove, {{and he seemed to}} notice that she glanced at the papers on the table, for he laughed.|$|R
6000|$|... "He shook ’is ’ead at ’em, {{and telling}} {{his wife to}} give the ’Dook o’ Wellington’ a mug of water, <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> agin and wiped the sweat off ’is brow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tom," [...] she said, [...] "I come to--" [...] and {{stopping}} suddenly, and regarding the silent group, she <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> and, covering {{her face with}} her handkerchief, began to sob.|$|R
