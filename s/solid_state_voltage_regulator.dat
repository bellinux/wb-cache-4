40|$|Feedback is an Feedback is used {{to control}} {{important}} concept gain and reduce distortion, in circuit design, {{as well as provide}} other where a signal or voltage important functions in derived from the output modern electronic designs is superimposed on the input. This output-toinput path can be used for several purposes— control output voltage, control gain, reduce distortion, improve stability, or create instability, as in an oscillator. This short tutorial reviews feedback, with emphasis on the classic negative feedback amplifier. Notes are also included on the methods for sampling the output and injecting the control signal at the input. Feedback Principles For a classic concept like feedback, classic reference texts are a good source of instruction. This section was written with the aid of three of those references [1, 2, 3]. A feedback control system consists of the building blocks shown in Figure 1. Although this is not the traditional control theory textbook diagram, it includes the necessary elements: the signal path, a means of sampling the output, processing of the feedback signal, and a means of reintroducing the error signal at the input. In the simplest feedback systems, the feedback signal processing may be one or two passive components, with direct connections to the through circuit at the output and input. The diagram can also become much more complex, with extensive signal processing and the addition of reference signals, comparators, delay lines and even multiple feedback loops. Intuitively, feedback control loops are used to achieve a specific performance objective. In a simple <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator,</b> the output sample is compared to a known reference, and error signal {{is used to}} adjust the conduction of the pass transistor until equilibrium is achieved—a constant output voltage. A radio automatic gain control (AGC) system works similarly. In this case, a portion of the output signal is amplified, then rectified to create the DC voltage that can be compared to a reference. The error signal controls the gain Error signal injectio...|$|E

Their output impedances have been intentionally developed to approach zero. Due {{to the nature}} of vacuum tubes and audio transformers, the output impedance of an average tube amplifier is usually considerably higher than the modern audio amplifiers produced completely without vacuum tubes or audio transformers. Most tube amplifiers with their higher output impedance are less ideal voltage amplifiers than the <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>voltage</b> amplifiers with their smaller output impedance.|$|R

40|$|Electron beams with {{an energy}} range of 10 keV at 2 A {{requiring}} intensity modulation with bandwidth from 50 kHz 7. 5 MHz pose an interesting {{problem to the}} RF designer. Driving the extraction electrode of an electron gun {{can be a challenge}} with these requirements. The straight forward approach is the construction of a vacuum tube, single ended amplifier capable of delivering the anode voltage to the extraction electrode of the gun. However, vacuum tubes of this size and power are becoming increasingly expensive, and as the technology dies, the reliability of new components comes into question. The logical alternative is the implementation of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> electronics. However, the 7. 5 MHz 7 kV requirements pose a problem, as the <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> high <b>voltage,</b> high current technology does not exist in a single package. A new system of driving the extraction electrode of a Pierce type gun was developed using MOSFETs.

Hence, the required on-chip area is as small as 0. 026 mm 2 for the proposed <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> which is approximately four to six times smaller than area efficient low dropout regulators.
