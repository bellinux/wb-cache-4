30|$|Tropospheric tidal forcing {{does not}} respond appreciatively to the solar cycle, and the E-region dynamo tidal winds remain more or less {{unaffected}} (Oberheide et al. 2009). In the thermosphere above 120  km, however, increasing background temperatures during higher solar activity cause more tidal dissipation because of the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity. For example, DE 3 amplitudes during solar minimum are much larger than during solar maximum: a factor of 3 in the zonal wind, 60 % in temperature and a factor of 5 in density (Oberheide et al. 2009; Häusler et al. 2013). On the other hand, relative TEC tidal amplitudes from COSMIC (Chang et al. 2013) do not show any <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>dependence.</b> This {{can be understood as}} the result of the absence of any <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>dependence</b> in the zonal wind tides in the dynamo region which are the main driver of ionospheric tidal variability.|$|E

To explore this charging region, an analysis of DMSP F 6, F 7, F 8, and F 9 satellite precipitating particle and ambient plasma measurements taken during periods of high, medium, and low solar flux is performed. One hundred eighty-four charging events ranging from − 46 to − 1430 V are identified, and an extreme <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>dependence</b> is found as charging is most frequent and severe during solar minimum. Satellite measurements and time-dependent ionospheric model (TDIM) output are {{used to determine the}} cause of the <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>dependence</b> and to characterize the environments which generate and inhibit these potentials. The electron precipitation associated with various DMSP charging levels is analyzed; it is suggested that precipitating electrons as low as 2 to 3 keV may contribute to charging though higher-energy electrons make greater contributions. Secondary electron production due to incident electrons below 1 keV is shown to inhibit charging. The energetic electron fluxes shown to generate charging do not vary significantly over the solar cycle. Instead, DMSP ambient plasma data and TDIM generated results identify a variation in plasma density over 1 or more orders of magnitude as the cause of the <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>dependence,</b> and an ambient plasma density of less than 104 cm− 3 is found necessary for significant negative charging (≥ 100 V) to occur...|$|E

30|$|Satellite {{measurements}} from high-resolution {{magnetic field}} mapping missions over almost a complete <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> {{have been used}} to investigate the variability of major magnetospheric currents during quiet times. As judged from near-Earth magnetic field observations, the magnetotail current system exhibits no long-term trend. Activity-dependent enhancements decay within hours. A suitable quantity to parameterize the temporal variation is the merging electric field, delayed by 60 minutes with respect to its value at the bow shock. Conversely, the ring current strength shows pronounced <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>dependences.</b> We show {{for the first time that}} a <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> dependent bias has to be added to DST to represent the actual ring current strength. It ranges from − 15 nT at solar maximum to zero at solar minimum. The scaled solar flux index, F 10.7, delayed by 20 months, is found to be a suitable proxy for predicting the bias. This empirical result reflects no physical relation between F 10.7 and ring current bias. A spherical harmonic model valid at Earth’s surface is presented that reflects the quiet-time magnetospheric fields.|$|R
40|$|Seasonal and <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>dependences</b> of the {{correlation}} between auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) and the auroral electrojet (AE) index have been investigated based on the plasma wave data obtained by the Akebono satellite. Under any seasonal and solar activity conditions, a clear correlation has been found between the AKR power flux and the AE index. The properties of {{the correlation}}, however, vary depending on season and solar activity. AKR power flux increases as about the 1. 2 power of AE index in all seasonal and solar activity conditions. However, even for the same AE index, AKR power flux during solar minimum is 5 dB larger than that during solar maximum. As for the seasonal variations, the AKR power flux in winter is 22 dB larger than that in summer even for the same AE index. The results suggest that long-term variations of AKR depend not only on auroral current variations but also on factors associated with the total energy flux of auroral electrons and the generation process of AKR...|$|R

Our results discussed the diurnal, seasonal, and <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>dependences</b> of vTEC at the local ionospheric conditions, during different phases of <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> {{in the light of the}} classification of Legrand and Simon. The vTEC over Alexandria exhibits the well-known equinoctial asymmetry which changes with the phases of the solar cycle; the spring vTEC is larger than that of autumn during the maximum, decreasing and minimum phases of <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> 23. During the increasing phase of <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> 24, it is the contrary. The diurnal variation of the vTEC presents multiple maxima during the equinox from 2005 to 2008 and during the summer solstice from 2006 to 2012. A nighttime vTEC enhancement and winter anomaly are also observed. During the deep solar minimum (2006 – 2009) the diurnal variation of the vTEC observed over Alexandria is similar to the diurnal variation observed during quiet magnetic period at equatorial latitudes. We observed also that the amplitude of vTEC at Libreville is larger than the amplitude of vTEC observed at Alexandria and Rabat, indeed Libreville is near the southern crest of the Equatorial Ionization anomaly.

The {{nature of}} the {{seasonal}} dependence of relativis-tic electron fluxes in the Earth’s outer zone is investigated using 11 years of data from sensors onboard the SAMPEX spacecraft. It is found that, the relativistic electron fluxes show a strong semiannual modulation. However, the highest electron fluxes occur at times {{well away from the}} nominal equinoxes, lagging them by about 30 days. The time lag also shows a <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> phase <b>dependence</b> for the peak fluxes. The electron peak fluxes lag the vernal equinox by almost 60 days during the ascending phase of the <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> while the time lag near the autumnal equinox remains unchanged. The observed times of the peak electron fluxes during the de-scending phase of the <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> agrees most closely with the Russel-Mcpherron effect and less so with the equinoctial effect even after including propagation effects for finite solar wind speed.

We used a revised version of the model described in Maus and Lühr (2005) which now includes the <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>dependence</b> of the magnetospheric ring current.

30|$|Another {{important}} {{finding of}} this study is the long-term stability of the contribution in GSM coordinates. Variations of the field strength aligned with the ZGSM component occur on time scales of hours. We identified the merging electric field as a suitable parameter for describing the short-term variability outside of magnetic storms. The derived time-delay for Em of 60 minutes with respect to conditions at the bow shock, when parameterizing the ZGSM field variations, supports the suggestion of ML (2005), namely, that the field in the GSM frame is primarily caused by tail currents. This implies that no <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>dependence</b> of the average tail lobe field could be deduced. The magnetic field generated by Champman-Ferraro currents likely ends up as part of the SM component.|$|E

The relative frequencies of occurrence of Kp with different magnitudes and the seasonal and <b>solar</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>dependences</b> are seen to be remarkably consistent despite the addition of 35 years of observations. Many of the earlier features seen in the indices and special intervals are shown to be replicated in the present analysis. Time variations in the occurrence of prolonged periods of geomagnetic calm or of enhanced activity are presented and their relation to solar activity highlighted. It is shown that in the declining phase the occurrence frequencies of Kp = 4 ? 5 (consecutively over 4 intervals) {{can be used as}} a precursor for the maximum sunspot number to be expected in the next cycle. The semi-annual variation in geomagnetic activity is re-examined utilising not only the Ap index but also the occurrence frequencies of Kp index with different magnitudes. Lack of dependence of the amplitude of semi-annual variation on sunspot number is emphasised. Singular spectrum analysis of the mean monthly Ap index shows some distinct periodic components. The temporal evolution of ~ 44 month, ~ 21 month and ~ 16 month oscillations are examined and it is postulated that while QBO and the 16 month oscillations could be attributed to solar wind and IMF oscillations with analogous periodicity, the 44 month variation is associated with a similar periodicity in recurrent high speed stream caused by sector boundary passage.
