40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} a concrete model for working capital management on operational level in an inter-organisational value chain. With the model, working capital committed to a product can be observed through the whole value chain. The value chain partners can manage working capital holistically through a collaborative view as well as benchmark their own position in the value chain. The scenarios presented in the paper demonstrate how inter-organisational working capital management actions can decrease financing costs caused by working capital. Opportunities for value creation and improvement of efficiency can be found for example through reduction of the cycle time of inventories, reduction of product costs, inventory shifting, using <b>shorter</b> <b>payment</b> periods, and by taking advantage of different costs of capital. working capital management; value chain; cycle time; supply chain management; SCM; inter-organisational cost management...|$|R

Due to this approach, the format was quickly recognized and accepted by many Czech invoice software companies and adopted by Czech banks.

5000|$|Another major Sfakian {{revolution}} {{was known as}} the [...] "Ornithopolemos" [...] (or the [...] "War of the Chickens"), which took place in 1470. This {{revolution was}} caused by the pressures the Venetians were placing on the Cretans in order to extract additional tax revenues. A new tax was introduced requiring all Cretan families to provide one well-fed chicken every month to the Venetian in charge of their area. As time went by and Cretan families began to multiply, the number of chickens demanded was increasing and arguments began to start about the correct number of chickens that should be given to the Venetian in charge of the area. Some villages started giving eggs rather than chickens on the basis that the Venetians would hatch the eggs themselves. Legal action was taken by the Venetians against the villagers for <b>short</b> <b>payment,</b> as well as against the Sfakians who were refusing to pay the tax altogether. Eventually, the Venetians issued over 10,000 indictments. The Sfakians, in return, compiled a report charging the Venetian authorities of corruption and sent the report to Chania for dispatch to Venice. The authorities at Chania imprisoned the Sfakian who brought the report and as a result, the Sfakians declared a revolution and encouraged the rest of the Cretans to refuse the tax. The revolution lasted for three years {{and at the end of}} the fighting, the Venetians agreed to withdraw the tax from the whole island, as well as withdraw all outstanding legal actions.|$|E

50|$|In finance, {{negative}} amortization (also {{known as}} NegAm, deferred interest or graduated payment mortgage) occurs whenever the loan payment for any period {{is less than}} the interest charged over that period so that the outstanding balance of the loan increases. As an amortization method the shorted amount (difference between interest and repayment) is then added to the total amount owed to the lender. Such a practice would have to be agreed upon before <b>shorting</b> the <b>payment</b> so as to avoid default on payment. This method is generally used in an introductory period before loan payments exceed interest and the loan becomes self-amortizing. The term is most often used for mortgage loans; corporate loans with negative amortization are called PIK loans.|$|R

40|$|In {{developing}} countries, smallholder farmers face many constraints including lack of information, {{and lack}} of access to credit and markets. To overcome these constraints, smallholder farmers can engage in contract farming. However, contract farming needs to meet farmers' preferences in order to be sustainable. This study aimed to analyze rice farmers' preferences for contract farming in Benin. Stated choice data were collected from 574 rice farmers. To account for heterogeneity, data were analyzed using a mixed logit model. Producers preferred contracts with seven major attributes: <b>short</b> term, <b>payment</b> on delivery, collective selling, agreement on quantity, no provision of credit, application of the market price, and no control by the partner. However, there was heterogeneity in the contract preferences of rice farmers.

40|$|In {{developed}} countries in everyday business, payment delays often present a problem. Payment delays {{have already been}} a matter of discussion in Slovenia for several years. Irrespective of some positive movements in the past years, the state of payment discipline in Slovenia is not at a satisfactory level. In this area, Slovenia could be classified among the less successful countries when compared to other countries in Europe. Our paper determines factors behind this fact. The findings are important not only for Slovenia, but also for other EU candidate countries faced with similar problems of transition. The paper has led to the following conclusions. Firstly, the more indebted companies have longer payment delays. Secondly, the longer the contractual <b>payment</b> period, the <b>shorter</b> the <b>payment</b> delay. Longer payment periods are mostly received by larger companies. And thirdly, the longer the payment delays on the side of companies. buyers, the higher the incidence of late payments by the company. We can therefore conclude, based on our research, that payment delays in Slovenia depend mostly on risks involved with doing business with firms in financial distress, in particular with small businesses...|$|R
