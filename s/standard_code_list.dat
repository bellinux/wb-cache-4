40|$|M. Com. (Economics) The South-African motor-cycle {{industry}} {{has experienced a}} constant decline in sales since 1981, that is, a drop from 84 000 units sold during 1981 to an expected sales figure of 24 000 units for 1985. This decline in sales {{poses a threat to}} the profitability and 'survival of the motor-cycle industry in South-Africa. Up to this point in time the marketing efforts of the motor-cycle industry were mainly directed towards the White consumer market. In order to bring about an upturn in motor-cycle sales, this study looked into the feasibility of a marketing effort, by the motor-cycle industry, aimed at the Black consumer market. The execution of such a feasibility study necessitated the gathering of information relating to the views and preferences of Blacks with regard to motor-cycles. Information was collected by distributing questionnaires to a random sample of Blacks in region nineteen according to the <b>Standard</b> <b>code</b> <b>list</b> for statistical main regions and regions, magisterial districts, cities, towns and non-urban areas. The potential of the Black market has been disregarded by the motor-cycle industry because of the belief that Blacks are apposed to motor-cycles {{as a result of their}} cultural traditions...|$|E

In {{ontology}} engineering, {{particularly when}} dealing with he-terogeneous domains and their subfields, legacy data, various data mo-dels, existing <b>standards,</b> <b>code</b> <b>lists,</b> and so forth, there is a frequently recurring need to express certain types of axioms that allow diverse re-presentational choices interoperate. Some of these axioms, which we call typecasting axioms, point to limitations of the Web Ontology Language (OWL), while others require best practice guides for the community. Here, we introduce these typecasting axioms and elaborate how such axioms can help the development of data integration using ontology and ontology patterns. We then conclude with a brief catalog of open research problems motivated by typecasting axioms, which may be of potential interest to both application developers and researchers working on logical foundations of OWL. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{several aspects}} of the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM, ISO 2012) {{associated}} to 2 D and 3 D cadastral situations within Malaysian cadastral registration system. Literature review shows that many countries propose their own profile based on the LADM such as The Netherlands, Portugal, Indonesia, Korea, Japan, Australia/ Queensland, Cyprus and others. Malaysia {{is one of the}} potential candidates towards LADMbased country profile, as proposed in this paper. Several aspects of the LADM such as the RRR’s (Rights, Restrictions and Responsibilities), the ’Spatial Unit’ and ’Party’ will be described related to 2 D and 3 D cadastral situations within the UML modelling language as a tool for the data modelling. <b>Code</b> <b>lists</b> are used to describe a more open and flexible enumeration values and associated to Malaysian mapping <b>standard.</b> <b>Code</b> <b>lists</b> are useful for expressing a long, and potentially extensible, list of potential values. The <b>code</b> <b>lists</b> included in the LADM aim to allow the use of local, regional or national terminology. We plan to utilise cadastral datasets from Malaysian NMA (National Mapping Authority, ’JUPEM’) and Land Office agency to illustrate the various cases.

40|$|Objective: Human ‘functioning’ {{is about}} how people live on a day-to-day basis. This paper sets out the case for {{adopting}} a common language about functioning that would improve population health information and information sharing across health and community service systems. Approach: Modern health systems recognise the importance of human functioning in addition to diagnosis and disease prevention. ‘Functioning’ {{is important in the}} context of chronic disease, mental health, healthy ageing, and the right of people with disabilities and their carers to participate in society. We outline major directions in the health system and their relationship to the concept of functioning. Conclusions and implications: The concept of functioning has not been used explicitly and consistently in Australian health and human service systems, which nevertheless deal with the 20 % of the population who experience difficulties in functioning. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is the international standard for definition, classification, information and measurement of functioning. While it has been partially implemented in Australia, it should be used more broadly, across health and community services, as the basis for information on functioning. This is an intended parallel {{to the use of the}} ICD as the <b>standard</b> classification and <b>code</b> <b>list</b> for disease monitoring and related health information systems. Monitoring health status and planning interventions and resources require information about people's functioning in their daily lives as well as their diseases. Such information should be based on the international standards developed for this purpose...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMedical {{encoding}} {{support systems}} for diagnoses and medical procedures are an emerging technology that begins {{to play a}} key role in billing, reimbursement, and health policies decisions. A significant problem to exploit these systems is how to measure the appropriateness of any automatically generated <b>list</b> of <b>codes,</b> in terms of fitness for use, i. e. their quality. Until now, only information retrieval performance measurements have been applied to estimate the accuracy of <b>codes</b> <b>lists</b> as quality indicator. Such measurements do not give the value of <b>codes</b> <b>lists</b> for practical medical encoding, and cannot be used to globally compare the quality of multiple <b>codes</b> <b>lists.</b> This paper defines and validates a new encoding information quality measure that addresses the problem of measuring medical <b>codes</b> <b>lists</b> quality. It is based on a usability study of how expert coders and physicians apply computer-assisted medical encoding. The proposed measure, named ADN, evaluates codes Accuracy, Dispersion and Noise, and is adapted to the variable length and content of generated <b>codes</b> <b>lists,</b> coping with limitations of previous measures. According to the ADN measure, the information quality of a <b>codes</b> <b>list</b> is fully represented by a single point, within a suitably constrained feature space. Using one scheme, our approach is reliable to measure and compare the information quality of hundreds of <b>codes</b> <b>lists,</b> showing their practical value for medical encoding. Its pertinence is demonstrated by simulation and application to real data corresponding to 502 inpatient stays in four clinic departments. Results are compared to the consensus of three expert coders who also coded this anonymized database of discharge summaries, and to five information retrieval measures. Information quality assessment applying the ADN measure showed the degree of encoding-support system variability from one clinic department to another, providing a global evaluation of quality measurement trends...|$|R
