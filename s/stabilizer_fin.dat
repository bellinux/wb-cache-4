25|$|One {{critical}} area of design was the {{positioning of the}} vertical <b>stabilizer</b> (<b>fin).</b> The CL-41 was intended to demonstrate spin recovery. If the fin is too far forward, a spin cannot be initiated, {{but if it is}} too far aft, recovery becomes impossible. Model tests were done to find the optimum position. The original Tutor wind-tunnel model had a cruciform tail, which was revised to the T-tail design by removing the portion above the horizontal stabilizer.|$|E
50|$|The Mark 7 {{nuclear weapon}} weighed {{approximately}} 1600 lb. It was fitted with one vertical retractable <b>stabilizer</b> <b>fin</b> that {{allowed it to}} fit better in or under some planes. This was unique, and made {{it one of the}} first nuclear weapons to be streamlined enough to be carried on smaller planes. The bomb’s diameter is a total of 30 in. It used a 92-point HE detonation system to initiate implosion and nuclear fission.|$|E

5000|$|The Science Fish is {{a parody}} of the {{traditional}} ichthys symbol that includes the addition of rocket <b>stabilizer</b> <b>fins</b> and is usually mounted or displayed at an angle as if launching into space.|$|R
50|$|Angular {{momentum}} {{is the measure}} of effectiveness for a gyro stabilizer, analogous to horsepower ratings on a diesel engine or kilowatts on a generator. In specifications for gyro stabilizers, the total angular momentum (moment of inertia multiplied by spin speed) is the key quantity. In modern designs, the output axis torque {{can be used to}} control the angle of the <b>stabilizer</b> <b>fins</b> (see above) to counteract the roll of the boat so that only a small gyroscope is needed. The idea for gyro controlling a ship's <b>fin</b> <b>stabilizers</b> was first proposed in 1932 by a General Electric scientist, Dr Alexanderson. He proposed a gyro to control the current to the electric motors on the <b>stabilizer</b> <b>fins,</b> with the actuating instructions being generated by thyratron vacuum tubes.|$|R
50|$|Although most {{passenger}} ships utilize stabilizers {{to reduce}} rolling in heavy weather, {{they are only}} used for crew and passenger comfort and do {{not contribute to the}} overall intact stability of the vessel. The ships must fulfill all stability requirements even with the <b>stabilizer</b> <b>fins</b> retracted.|$|R
50|$|Each Navy and Marine Corps {{aircraft}} normally has its Bureau Number {{plus the}} type designation marked in small {{letters on the}} rear fuselage. Sometimes the last four digits of the serial are painted on the fuselage or vertical <b>stabilizer</b> <b>fin.</b> Sometimes the last three digits are used as the side codes also known as nose numbers or MODEXs (most commonly in the USN P-3C Orion and P-8A Poseidon fleet), but on most operational aircraft this is normally a squadron assigned code instead of a shortened serial number.|$|E
50|$|The crew {{placed the}} ship on {{autopilot}} {{and did not}} have a crew member watch the ship. Even with autopilot on, standard practice calls for one crew member to watch the controls, for example to avoid collisions with other vessels. The crew deployed the fin stabilizers system to decrease the motions in bad weather; normally both stabilizer fins deployed, but in this case the port <b>stabilizer</b> <b>fin</b> did not deploy. This caused the ship to drift and therefore not travel in a straight line. A crew member discovered the problem and, at the last minute, tried to steer the ship to port. This action occurred too late. At 10:12 P.M. the ship struck the east face of the taller Portes pinnacle. The rocks tore a six-meter long and one-meter wide hole above the water line. After that impact, the rocks bent the <b>stabilizer</b> <b>fin</b> backwards, and the fin cut through the hull through the side, below the waterline, and next to the engine room. The water from the three-meter gash destroyed the main generators and ended electrical power. Professor David Molyneaux, a ship safety expert, said that the damage sustained by the MS Express Samina should not normally sink such a ship. The ship sank because nine of the ship's eleven watertight compartment doors were open when safety laws require ship operators to close and lock the safety doors. The water spread beyond the engine room, and {{due to a lack of}} power the operators could not remotely shut the doors. Molyneaux described the open watertight doors as the most significant aspect of the sinking.|$|E
50|$|Once motion {{has been}} established, the motion {{itself can be}} {{controlled}} {{with the use of}} other fins. Boats control direction (yaw) with fin-like rudders, and roll with <b>stabilizer</b> <b>fins</b> and keel fins. Airplanes achieve similar results with small specialised fins that change the shape of their wings and tail fins.|$|R

50|$|Many {{vessels are}} fitted with active {{stability}} systems. Active stability systems {{are defined by}} the need to input energy to the system {{in the form of a}} pump, hydraulic piston, or electric actuator. These systems include <b>stabilizer</b> <b>fins</b> attached to the side of the vessel or tanks in which fluid is pumped around to counteract the motion of the vessel.|$|R
50|$|There are {{bevel gears}} driving coaxial {{contra-rotating}} double 4 blades screws to propel torpedo running straight under the water. Tail section has {{vertical and horizontal}} <b>stabilizer</b> <b>fins</b> in cross. Each fin has a controlling rudder in aft. Horizontal fins and rudders or elevators have wide span in longitudinal direction and work proportionally, while vertical fins are small, and rudders have very short span.|$|R
5000|$|The ZMC-2 was {{nicknamed the}} [...] "Tin Bubble" [...] {{and was also}} {{sometimes}} called a [...] "tinship". The skin was not tin but Alclad. The airship was roughly teardrop shaped and had eight small <b>stabilizer</b> <b>fins,</b> four of which had rudders. It was held together with over 3.5 million rivets, which were applied by an innovative sewing machine-like device which produced airtight seams.|$|R
50|$|On some aircraft, {{horizontal}} and vertical stabilizers are combined {{in a pair of}} surfaces named V-tail. In this arrangement, two <b>stabilizers</b> (<b>fins</b> and rudders) are mounted at 90 - 120° to each other, giving a larger horizontal projected area than vertical one as in the majority of conventional tails. The moving control surfaces are then named ruddervators. The V-tail thus acts both as a yaw and pitch stabilizer.|$|R
50|$|Atlantic Star {{was fitted}} with two {{retractable}} <b>stabilizer</b> <b>fins,</b> {{which could be}} extended either individually or together depending on the sea conditions. Each fin was 4 m long and 1.5 m wide. They were controlled by hydraulic rams and were fed information from gyroscopes which sense the vessel's rolling motion. When in use, they could {{reduce the amount of}} the vessels roll by up to 85% but they had no effect on the ship's pitching motion.|$|R
50|$|Two bow and two stern {{thrusters}} provide port manoeuvrability, and {{two pairs}} of <b>stabilizer</b> <b>fins</b> reduce rolling. A special silicone-based paint, instead of biocides used by much of the industry, keeps barnacles off of the hull. This increases her efficiency by reducing drag while also protecting the ocean from biocides that may leak. The paint is credited with lowering the water drag enough to save 1,200 tonnes of fuel per year. The ship has a bulbous bow, a standard feature for cargo ships.|$|R
5000|$|Certain air-deployed munitions, {{particularly}} [...] "dumb" [...] or unguided 500-pound bombs, {{are often}} retrofitted with bolt-on strake sets. Designed as an open collar with strakes fitted {{to the outside}} face, these strake sets are used to alter and normalize the aerodynamics of the weapon, yielding greater accuracy. As most such munitions were manufactured with only tail-mounted <b>stabilizer</b> <b>fins,</b> the addition of longitudinal strakes proves a much cleaner flow of air around the weapon during its glide, reducing the tendency to yaw and improving terminal accuracy.|$|R
2500|$|Frost made a {{proposal}} that Avro start an experimental project based on vertical takeoff and landing concepts. [...] "It was {{not a case of}} Frost indulging in a personal whim. The idea of a saucer-like flying machine had revolutionary implications then and still does. A conventional aircraft is very inefficient, aerodynamically. Like a bumble bee, there's no way it should fly. It only does so because of the wing which gives it lift and the engine's power to overcome the drag of the fuselage, the load, the tailplane, the <b>stabilizers,</b> <b>fins</b> and the engines." ...|$|R
50|$|Ship {{stabilizing}} gyroscopes are {{a technology}} {{developed in the}} 19th century and early 20th century and used to stabilize roll motions in ocean-going ships. It lost favor in this application to hydrodynamic roll <b>stabilizer</b> <b>fins</b> because of reduced cost and weight. However, more recently (since the 1990s) a growing interest in the device has reemerged for low speed roll stabilization of vessels. Unlike fins, the gyroscope does not rely on the forward speed of the ship to generate a roll stabilizing moment and therefore can stabilize motor yachts while at anchorage.|$|R

25|$|The launch {{came very}} close to failure—a postflight {{examination}} of telemetry data found that the Blok G strap-on had not attained full power at ignition and the resulting imbalanced thrust caused the booster to pitch over about 2° six seconds after liftoff. Two seconds later, the flight control system tried to compensate by rapidly moving the vernier engines and <b>stabilizer</b> <b>fins.</b> The Blok G strap-on finally reached 100% thrust only one second before the pitch angle would have been great enough to trigger an automatic shutdown command, which would have terminated the launch and sent the R-7 and Sputnik 1 crashing to the ground in a fireball only a short distance from the pad.|$|R
50|$|The {{basic design}} of the SAS has {{remained}} almost unchanged in 50 years of use and all Soyuz launches carry it. The only modification was in 1972 when the aerodynamic fairing over the SAS motor nozzles was deleted for weight-saving reasons as the redesigned Soyuz 7K-T spacecraft carried extra life support equipment. The unmanned Progress resupply ferry has a dummy escape tower and deletes the <b>stabilizer</b> <b>fins</b> from the payload shroud. There have been two failed launches of a manned Soyuz vehicle, Soyuz 18-1 in 1975 and Soyuz T-10-1 in 1983, but the former was aborted after escape tower jettison. The latter successfully rescued the cosmonauts from an on-pad fire and explosion of the launch vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Only {{one type}} of grenade, the PG-2 HEAT (High Explosive Anti-Tank), {{was used in the}} RPG-2. The propellant, {{consisting}} of granulated powder was in a rolled cardboard case treated with wax that had to be attached to the grenade before loading. Once attached to the propellant charge the grenade was inserted into the smooth-bore launcher from the front. A tab on the body of the grenade indexes in a notch cut in the tube so that the primer in the propelling charge aligns with the firing pin and hammer mechanism.To fire the RPG-2 the grenadier cocked an external hammer with his thumb, aimed, and pulled the trigger to fire. Upon launch six <b>stabilizer</b> <b>fins</b> unfolded from the grenade.|$|R

5000|$|A {{vertical}} <b>stabilizer</b> or <b>fin</b> is {{a vertical}} wing-like surface mounted {{at the rear}} of the plane and typically protruding above it. The fin stabilizes the plane's yaw (turn left or right) and mounts the rudder which controls its rotation along that axis.|$|R
50|$|In the {{conversion}} to a helicopter-carrying vessel, Assiniboine was gutted except for machinery and some forward spaces. The hull was strengthened, fueling facilities for the helicopter and activated <b>fin</b> <b>stabilizers</b> installed. The <b>fin</b> <b>stabilizers</b> were to reduce roll in rough weather during helicopter operations. All seven St Laurents were fitted with helicopter platforms and SQS 504 Variable Depth Sonar (VDS). The single funnel was altered to twin stepped funnels {{to permit the}} forward extension of the helicopter hangar. To {{make room for the}} helicopter deck, the aft 3-inch mount and one of the Limbos were removed. The two 40 mm guns were also removed. Following {{the conversion}}, the displacement remained the same at standard load but at full load, it increased to 3051 t.|$|R
