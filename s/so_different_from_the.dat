25|$|As {{with other}} crustaceans, copepods have a larval form. For copepods, the egg hatches into a nauplius form, {{with a head}} and a tail but no true thorax or abdomen. The larva molts several times until it resembles the adult and then, after more molts, {{achieves}} adult development. The nauplius form is <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> adult form that it was {{once thought to be}} a separate species.|$|E
25|$|The Revolution did {{revolutionize}} social relations. It did {{displace the}} deference, the patronage, the social divisions that had determined {{the way people}} viewed one another for centuries and still view one another {{in much of the}} world. It did give to ordinary people a pride and power, not to say an arrogance, that have continued to shock visitors from less favored lands. It may have left standing a host of inequalities that have troubled us ever since. But it generated the egalitarian view of human society that makes them troubling and makes our world <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> own in which the revolutionists had grown up.|$|E

25|$|We {{said this}} movie is a stylized movie, it’s not <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> world of a musical. And {{there were a few}} other things that contributed to that direction. One was the {{decision}} on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so you know, this is the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and that idea was in the air. That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E

[...] Kassandra is happiest when she travels with the Amazons, whose chief Penthesilea becomes a mother figure for Kassandra.|$|E
500|$|Alfred Pollard termed {{some of the}} pre-1623 {{versions}} as [...] "bad quartos" [...] {{because of}} their adapted, paraphrased or garbled texts, which may in places have been reconstructed from memory. Where several versions of a play survive, each differs from the other. The differences may stem from copying or printing errors, from notes by actors or audience members, or from Shakespeare's own papers. In some cases, for example, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, and Othello, Shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions. In the case of King Lear, however, while most modern editions do conflate them, the 1623 folio version is <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1608 quarto that the Oxford Shakespeare prints them both, arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion.|$|E

So it was [...] "Use our ideas.

500|$|... "Runaway Baby" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. Luke Gibson from HipHopDX and Entertainment Weekly Leah Greenblatt considered [...] "Runaway Baby" [...] {{one of the}} standouts in the album. The former added that Mars shows his writing skills, despite being <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other recordings. While reviewing the album, Harris Decker of the website The Truth About Music praised the song. He {{found it to be}} a [...] "rocking, beat driven" [...] that allowed the album to have [...] "a life of its own". Yahoo!'s music critic, Sherri Thornhill, had a mixed opinion towards the track, calling it a [...] "catchy" [...] and [...] "gets your toes tapping", despite not being on of her favorites. Blues & Soul publication found [...] "Runaway Baby" [...] to be inspired in The Jacksons, and [...] "60s rock groove" [...] from Eric Clapton and Cream; dubbing it as [...] "enjoyable even though it's completely vacuous!".|$|E
500|$|Unlike his sources, Shakespeare gives Banquo {{no role in}} the King's murder, {{making it}} a deed {{committed}} solely by Macbeth and his wife. Why Shakespeare's Banquo is <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> character described by Holinshed and Boece is not known, though critics have proposed several possible explanations. First among them is the risk associated with portraying the king's ancestor as a murderer and conspirator in the plot to overthrow a rightful king, as well as the author's desire to flatter a powerful patron. But Shakespeare may also simply have altered Banquo's character because there was no dramatic need for another accomplice to the murder. There was, however, a need to provide a dramatic contrast to Macbeth; a role that many scholars argue is filled by Banquo. Similarly, when Jean de Schelandre wrote about Banquo in his Stuartide in 1611, he also changed the character by portraying him as a noble and honourable man—the critic D. W. Maskell describes him as [...] "...Schelandre's paragon of valour and virtue"—probably for reasons similar to Shakespeare's.|$|E
50|$|SERV, {{short for}} Single-stage Earth-orbital Reusable Vehicle, was a {{proposed}} space launch system designed by Chrysler's Space Division for the Space Shuttle project.

25|$|A {{frequent}} charge laid by {{the critics}} of the Commissioners' Plan is that the excavation and leveling necessary to implement it basically destroyed the topography of Manhattan.

500|$|Some reviewers {{noted that}} Half-Blood Prince {{contained}} a darker tone {{than the previous}} Potter novels. The Christian Science Monitor reviewer Yvonne Zipp considered the first half to contain a lighter tone to soften the unhappy ending. The Boston Globe reviewer Liz Rosenberg wrote, [...] "lightness [...] slimmer than ever in this darkening series... a new charge of gloom and darkness. I felt depressed by the time I was {{two-thirds of the way}} through". She also compared the setting to Charles Dickens's depictions of London, as it was [...] "brooding, broken, gold-lit, as living character as any other". Christopher Paolini called the darker tone [...] "disquieting" [...] because it was <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> earlier books. Liesl Schillinger, a contributor to The New York Times book review, also noted that Half-Blood Prince was [...] "far darker" [...] but [...] "leavened with humor, romance and snappy dialogue". She suggested a connection to the 11 September attacks, as the later, darker novels were written after that event. David Kipen, a critic of the San Francisco Chronicle considered the [...] "darkness as a sign of our paranoid times" [...] and singled out curfews and searches that were part of the tightened security at Hogwarts, as a resemblance to our world.|$|E
500|$|Production on Genealogy of the Holy War {{began after}} the {{completion}} of [...] in 1994. Returning staff included series creator Shouzou Kaga, who acted as director, designer and scenario writer; composer Yuka Tsujiyoko, who had handled all previous entries in the series; and Nintendo producer Gunpei Yokoi. Genealogy of the Holy War would be the last game produced by Yokoi. Character design was handled primarily by Katsuyoshi Koya, who had previously worked on Mystery of the Emblem: it would be Koya's last work on the series, as both he and Kaga were unsatisfied with the quality of his illustrations. Additional work was done by Mayumi Hirota. This was later blamed upon severe time constraints when compared to the development of Mystery of the Emblem. In contrast, Kaga was enthusiastic about Hirota's work, praising how she managed to capture his visions for the characters. The overall development was turbulent due to a general staff changeover between Mystery of the Emblem and Genealogy of the Holy War, in addition to most of the production team moving offices. According to future series producer Masahiro Higuchi, the initial concept for Genealogy of the Holy War was <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> typical Fire Emblem game that it was instead dubbed [...] "Holy Sword Emblem Kaiser". This name had to be dropped due to space limitations and other unspecified issues, and as its content was coming more in line with the Fire Emblem series, its title was changed to [...] "Sword Emblem". It was eventually given the Fire Emblem title when its mechanics settled into their current form.|$|E

50|$|On 25 August 1950, Convair {{issued a}} formal {{proposal}} for a swept-winged version of the B-36 with all-jet propulsion. The United States Air Force was sufficiently interested that on 15 March 1951, it authorized Convair to convert two B-36Fs (49-2676 and 49-2684) as B-36Gs. Since the aircraft was <b>so</b> radically <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> existing B-36, the designation was soon changed to YB-60.|$|R

2500|$|The first {{regressive}} palatalization of velars (see below) {{may well}} have operated during Early Common Slavic and is thought by Arnošt Lemprecht to have specifically operated during the 5th century. The progressive palatalization of velars, if it is older, can predate this only by 200 to 300 years at most, since it post-dates Proto-Germanic borrowings into Slavic, which are generally agreed to have occurred no earlier than the 2nd century. The monophthongization of /au/, /ai/ {{is thought to have}} occurred near the end of Early Common Slavic or beginning of Middle Common Slavic ( [...] 600), and the second regressive palatalization of velars not long afterwards. [...] This implies that, until {{around the time of the}} earliest Slavic expansion, Slavic was a conservative language not <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> various attested Baltic languages.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Barker of Variety {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, writing, [...] "Ditching the hangovers, the backward structure, the fleshed-out characters and {{any sense of}} debauchery or fun, this installment instead just thrusts its long-suffering protagonists into a rote chase narrative..." [...] Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Young viewers looking for unbridled raunch will be sadly disappointed, and so will other moviegoers expecting {{more than a few}} wan chuckles." [...] Steven Holden of The New York Times called The Hangover Part III [...] "a dull, lazy walkthrough that along with The Big Wedding has a claim to be the year's worst star-driven movie." [...] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "I'm not sure who let the dogs out this time, but they should be made to pay." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "Director Todd Phillips delivers a film <b>so</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first two, I'm not even sure it's supposed to be a comedy." ...|$|E
