5|$|Knott's {{most notable}} {{action as a}} {{legislator}} occurred {{near the end of}} his first stint in Congress. On January 27, 1871, he delivered a satirical speech ridiculing a bill that would have provided fifty-seven land grants and financial concessions to railroads to further their westward expansion. In the speech, Knott singled out the Bayfield and <b>St.</b> <b>Croix</b> Railroad's proposed line from the <b>St.</b> <b>Croix</b> River to Duluth, Minnesota to make his point. He derided the remoteness of the town and the need for a railroad to it by repeatedly referring to a map and asking where Duluth was located. Following the speech, the railroad bill was killed and Congress adjourned for the day.|$|E

5|$|On <b>St.</b> <b>Croix,</b> waves up to 15ft (4.5m) from Omar sank about 47 boats, {{leading to}} a large oil spill around the islands. About 400 ships broke lose from the docks, 200 of which lost their anchors. Omar {{produced}} upwards of 7in (177.8mm) of rain on the island within a 24‑hour span. Although <b>St.</b> <b>Croix</b> was brushed by the eyewall, sustained winds reached 53mph (85km/h) with gusts to 72mph (116km/h). Three people needed to be rescued when their ship struck a reef and began to sink. Most of the islands 55,000 residents were without power as over 100 utility poles were destroyed. Damages on the island were estimated at $700,000 with another $1million in clean-up costs. St. Thomas, {{one of the hardest}} hit islands, was left completely without power {{in the wake of the}} hurricane. All of the major intersections were shut down as traffic lights were either on the ground or without power. Damages on the island totaled to $5.3million.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton is {{not known}} to have ever owned slaves, {{although}} {{members of his family}} were slave owners. At the time of her death, Hamilton's mother owned two slaves named Christian and Ajax, and she had written a will leaving them to her sons; however, due to their illegitimacy, Hamilton and his brother were held ineligible to inherit her property, and never took ownership of the slaves. Later, as a youth in <b>St.</b> <b>Croix,</b> Hamilton worked for a company trading in commodities that included slaves. During his career, Hamilton did occasionally purchase or sell slaves for others as their legal representative, and one of Hamilton's grandsons interpreted some of these journal entries as being purchases for himself.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{calls were}} made to police in the United States Virgin Islands about downed power lines {{throughout}} {{the passage of the}} depression. High winds, gusting up to 40mph (65km/h) left roughly 500 people without telephone service on <b>St.</b> <b>Croix.</b> No major damage was reported on any of the affected islands in the wake of Christine. Residents in the drought-stricken regions of Florida were hoping for increased rainfall from the remnant wave of Christine; however, the system did not reach the United States before dissipating. The storm's remnants only produced squally weather in Florida on September7 and 8.|$|E

5000|$|Frederiksted {{is often}} {{referred}} to as [...] "Freedom City" [...] by locals. This nickname has to do with the fact that the town was the site of the emancipation of slaves in the then-Danish West Indies. On July 3, 1848, freed slave and skilled craftsman Moses Gottlieb, who also was known as [...] "General Buddhoe," [...] led the uprising, organized slaves on <b>St.</b> <b>Croix's</b> West End plantations, and marched on the town of Frederiksted.

5|$|Starting in 1918, the Wisconsin Highway Commission erected highway numbers along state-maintained roadways. The highway {{across the}} state from <b>St.</b> <b>Croix</b> Falls to Armstrong Creek was {{numbered}} WIS14 at that time. The remainder {{of what is now}} US8 was unnumbered secondary highways, and WIS14 continued north of Armstrong Creek to Florence. When Michigan numbered its highway system the following year, the future US8 {{was not included in the}} system. In Minnesota, US8 would follow what was Constitutional Route46, which was designated in a state constitutional amendment adopted on November 2, 1920; that roadway originally ran between Forest Lake and Chisago City through Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|The {{reservations}} in Wisconsin {{were named}} the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation, and Lac du Flambeau Indian Reservation.

50|$|Several {{companies}} {{have participated in}} drafting plans to refurbish and enhance the greater Frederiksted area. Coastal Systems was retained by the Public Finance Authority to develop concepts for a waterfront park, beach, cruise pier, and other site improvements. Teams of land planners, engineers, and landscape architects met with local interest groups to develop conceptual plans for the redevelopment of the area. Environmental regulatory surveys and permits were managed by the Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Agency of the USVI. Phase I {{of the project was}} completed, which consisted of the reconstruction of the waterfront park while maintaining the historical facade representative of <b>St.</b> <b>Croix's</b> heritage.

All businesses {{were shut down}} in Dominica on September3 due to the storm. In Antigua and Barbuda, all schools and the local airport were closed as a precautionary measure. Two cruise ships, the Carnival Glory and a Royal Caribbean ship postponed their docking dates and stayed at sea for a few additional days. The islands of Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy were placed under an orange alert, the second-lowest alert level, and Guadeloupe was placed under a yellow alert, the lowest alert level. In Puerto Rico, officials closed schools and government offices on September4 and opened 433 shelters across the island.

5|$|Following heavy {{damage to}} the coral reef around Curaçao, workers placed reef balls to assist in {{replenishing}} the damaged structure. In Puerto Rico, workers quickly responded to power and water outages. Similarly on Saint Croix, power systems were quickly restored. On November23, U.S. President Bill Clinton declared the U.S. Virgin Islands a disaster area. This allocated federal funding for loans to public and private entities and provided 75percent {{of the cost of}} debris removal. By December10, nearly 3,000residents had applied for assistance, mostly on <b>St.</b> <b>Croix.</b> In response, the federal government provided about $480,000 to the affected people. The United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided $185,000, mostly directed toward the United Nations Development Programme, for aid to other islands in the eastern Caribbean. Other agencies, including the Caribbean Development Bank, the United Kingdom's Department for International Development, and the European Union, provided $1.1million in assistance.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not certain}} whether the year of Hamilton's birth was 1755 or 1757. Most {{historical}} evidence after Hamilton's arrival in North America supports {{the idea that he}} was born in 1757, including Hamilton's own writings. Hamilton listed his birth year as 1757 when he first arrived in the Thirteen Colonies, and celebrated his birthday on January 11. In later life, he tended to give his age only in round figures. Historians accepted 1757 as his birth year until about 1930, when additional documentation of his early life in the Caribbean was published, initially in Danish. A probate paper from <b>St.</b> <b>Croix</b> in 1768, drafted after the death of Hamilton's mother, listed him as 13 years old, which has caused some historians since the 1930s to favor a birth year of 1755.|$|E
5000|$|<b>St.</b> <b>Croix's</b> {{history of}} {{migration}} has sometimes caused tensions between immigrants and Crucians whose ancestry {{on the island}} dates back for generations. Tensions have subsided to some extent in recent years, mainly due to intermarriage among Crucians and other Caribbean peoples. In the late 1990s, many people supported legislation to define as a [...] "native U.S. Virgin Islander" [...] anyone who could trace their ancestry on the island to 1927, {{the year in which}} U.S. Virgin Islanders were granted United States citizenship. This effort by a select group of nationalist senators eventually failed after much public outcry and controversy. It was learned that most native-born U.S. Virgin Islanders would not qualify as [...] "native" [...] under the proposed legislation, as their immigrant ancestors had arrived later than 1927, but thousands of Danish citizens would have qualified.|$|R
50|$|Salt River Canyon is a prehistoric {{river and}} {{waterfall}} having cut two deep walls {{facing each other}} across a quarter mile of blue water. The feature {{is one of the}} best known of <b>St.</b> <b>Croix's</b> dive features, along with the Frederiksted Pier. The most popular scuba diving locations are a few hundred yards outside the Salt River Bay. Although most of the boat moorings are 25-45' deep, the actual canyon reaches nearly 500' in depth. Recreational scuba limits are 130' and well into the shadows of the canyon walls. This location is known for its sheer depth, clarity, and wildlife. February and March play host to nursing humpback whales. Year-round are both the nurse shark and reef shark. Occasionally one of the pods of dolphins may come swimming by as well. Sport Diver Magazine has also rated this area as one of the top 5 for water clarity in the Caribbean.|$|R
