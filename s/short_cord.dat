60|$|Oberlus {{now makes}} all haste and accosts the negro, who, aghast at seeing any living being inhabiting such a solitude, and {{especially}} so horrific a one, immediately {{falls into a}} panic, not at all lessened by the ursine suavity of Oberlus, who begs the favor of assisting him in his labors. The negro stands with several billets on his shoulder, in act of shouldering others; and Oberlus, with a <b>short</b> <b>cord</b> concealed in his bosom, kindly proceeds to lift those other billets to their place. In so doing, he persists in keeping behind the negro, who, rightly suspicious of this, in vain dodges about to gain the front of Oberlus; but Oberlus dodges also; till at last, weary of this bootless attempt at treachery, or fearful of being surprised by {{the remainder of the}} party, Oberlus runs off a little space to a bush, and fetching his blunderbuss, savagely commands the negro to desist work and follow him. He refuses. Whereupon, presenting his piece, Oberlus snaps at him. Luckily the blunderbuss misses fire; but by this time, frightened out of his wits, the negro, upon a second intrepid summons, drops his billets, surrenders at discretion, and follows on. By a narrow defile familiar to him, Oberlus speedily removes {{out of sight of the}} water.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{arriving}} {{at the end of}} each day's journey the camels were allowed to browse at will, a <b>short</b> <b>cord</b> being tied between one of their hind and one of their fore feet. The Arabs then set to work to collect sticks and to make a fire--not for cooking, for their only food was dried dates and some black bread, which they brought with them--but for warmth, as the nights were damp and somewhat chilly, as they sat round the fire, talked, and told stories. Before finally going off to rest, each went out into the bushes and brought in his camel; these were then arranged in a circle around the Arabs, one of the latter being mounted as sentry to prevent any sudden surprise--not indeed that they had the smallest fear of the Christians, who were far distant; but then, as now, the Arabs of the desert were a plundering race, and were ever ready to drive off each other's camels or horses. Cuthbert determined that if flight was possible it must be undertaken during the interval after the arrival at the halting-place and before the bringing in of the camels. Therefore, each day upon the halt he had pretended great fatigue from the rough motion of the camel, and had, after hastily eating the dates handed to him, thrown himself down, covered himself with his Arab robe, and feigned instant sleep. Thus they had in the three days from starting come to look upon his presence sleeping close to them as a matter of course.|$|E

40|$|Fetal motor {{activity}} {{is believed to}} influence umbilical cord growth. As Down's syndrome is associated with hypotonicity and reduced fetal activity, we hypothesized that newborn infants with this syndrome have <b>short</b> umbilical <b>cords.</b> We identified 21 infants with Down's syndrome and compared each individual cord length to mean standard values derived from the same population and matched for sex, race, and gestational age. Infants with Down's syndrome {{were found to have}} significantly <b>shorter</b> umbilical <b>cords</b> (mean of 45. 1 cm compared with 57. 3 cm for matched standards). It is not clear whether their <b>cords</b> are <b>shorter</b> on the basis of decreased fetal activity, genetics, or both.

60|$|The beeswax is a {{still more}} {{important}} and valuable product, {{formed by the}} wild bees (Apis dorsata), which build huge honeycombs, suspended {{in the open air}} from the underside of the lofty branches of the highest trees. These are of a semicircular form, and often three or four feet in diameter. I once saw the natives take a bees' nest, and a very interesting sight it was. In the valley where I used to collect insects, I one day saw three or four Timorese men and boys under a high tree, and, looking up, saw on a very lofty horizontal branch three large bees' combs. The tree was straight and smooth-barked and without a branch, until at seventy or eighty feet from the ground it gave out the limb which the bees had chosen for their home. As the men were evidently looking after the bees, I waited to watch their operations. One of them first produced a long piece of wood apparently the stem of a small tree or creeper, which he had brought with him, and began splitting it through in several directions, which showed that it was very tough and stringy. He then wrapped it in palm-leaves, which were secured by twisting a slender creeper round them. He then fastened his cloth tightly round his loins, and producing another cloth wrapped it around his head, neck, and body, and tied it firmly around his neck, leaving his face, arms, and legs completely bare. Slung to his girdle he carried a long thin coil of cord; and while he had been making these preparations, one of his companions had cut a strong creeper or bush-rope eight or ten yards long, to one end of which the wood-torch was fastened, and lighted at the bottom, emitting a steady stream of smoke. Just above the torch a chopping-knife was fastened by a <b>short</b> <b>cord.</b>|$|E
60|$|A {{very curious}} ape, the Siamang, was also rather abundant, {{but it is}} much less bold than the monkeys, keeping to the virgin forests and {{avoiding}} villages. This species is allied to the little long-armed apes of the genus Hylobates, but is considerably larger, and differs from them by having the two first fingers of the feet united together, nearly to the end as does its Latin name, Siamanga syndactyla. It moves much more slowly than the active Hylobates, keeping lower down in trees, and not indulging in such tremendous leaps; {{but it is still}} very active, and by means of its immense long arms, five feet six inches across in an adult about three feet high, can swing itself along among the trees at a great rate. I purchased a small one, which had been caught by the natives and tied up so tightly as to hurt it. It was rather savage at first, and tried to bite; but when we had released it and given it two poles under the verandah to hang upon, securing it by a <b>short</b> <b>cord,</b> running along the pole with a ring so that it could move easily, it became more contented, and would swing itself about with great rapidity. It ate almost any kind of fruit and rice, and I was in hopes to have brought it to England, but it died just before I started. It took a dislike to me at first, which I tried to get over by feeding it constantly myself. One day, however, it bit me so sharply while giving it food, that I lost patience and gave it rather a severe beating, which I regretted afterwards, as from that time it disliked me more than ever. It would allow my Malay boys to play with it, and for hours together would swing by its arms from pole to pole and on to the rafters of the verandah, with so much ease and rapidity, that it was a constant source of amusement to us. When I returned to Singapore it attracted great attention, as no one had seen a Siamang alive before, although it is not uncommon {{in some parts of the}} Malay peninsula.|$|E

40|$|Metastatic urothelial {{carcinoma}} (UC) to serous effusion (SE) {{is extremely}} rare and its cytomorphological features {{have only been}} described in case reports. In this study, we searched the pathology database at University of Michigan for SEs due to metastatic UC in the last 20 years. A total of 25 cases from 20 patients with clinically and pathologically confirmed metastatic UC in SEs were retrieved. The specimens consisted of 15 pleural, 8 peritoneal, and 2 pericardial effusions. Smears were reviewed and evaluated for the following features: cellularity, single cells, cell clusters or <b>short</b> <b>cords,</b> cell wrapping, “windows” between the cells, two‐tone cytoplasm, cytoplasmic vacuoles, signet ring cells, nuclear to cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio, nuclear hyperchromasia, irregular nuclear membrane, nuclear centricity, double or multiple nuclei, nucleoli, anaplastic cells and mitosis. Our results showed that UC manifested in SEs predominantly as a single cell population with or without clusters or <b>short</b> <b>cords,</b> and frequently exhibited the “cell wrapping” {{of two or more}} cells. Individual UC cell in SEs exhibited nuclear enlargement with increased N/C ratio, irregular nuclear membranes, hyperchromatic coarse chromatin and frequently prominent nucleoli. Double or multinucleated cells, cells with vacuolated cytoplasm or signet ring appearance were also frequently present. Our results demonstrated that while certain features could suggest the diagnosis of UC, the cytomorphological features are not specific and often overlap with those of reactive mesothelium, mesothelioma, metastatic adenocarcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma in SEs. Accurate diagnosis of UC rests on the combination of clinical history, cytomorphologic features and appropriate immunohistochemical panel. Diagn.
