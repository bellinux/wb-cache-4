50|$|The order Accipitriformes is {{believed}} to have originated 44 million years ago when it split from the common ancestor of the secretarybird (<b>Sagittarius</b> <b>serpentarius)</b> and the accipitrid species. The phylogeny of Accipitriformes is complex and difficult to unravel. Widespread paraphylies were observed in many phylogenetic studies. More recent and detailed studies show similar results. However, according to the findings of a 2014 study, the sister relationship between larger clades of Accipitriformes was well supported (e.g. relationship of Harpagus kites to buzzards and sea eagles and these latter two with Accipiter hawks are sister taxa of the clade containing Aquilinae and Harpiinae).|$|E

Some of the other notable bird species recorded are: avocet, blackwinged stilt (Himantopus himantopus), blacksmith lapwing (Vanellus armatus), black-necked grebe (Podiceps nigricollis), bustards, carmine, darters, African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer), geese, korhaans, pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), black-chested snake-eagle (Circaetus pectoralis), blue-cheeked bee-eater (Merops persicus), Cape teal (Anas capensis), kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), Hottentot teal (Anas hottentota), martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus), red-knobbed coot, (Fulica cristata), secretarybird (<b>Sagittarius</b> <b>serpentarius),</b> spoonbills, and white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata).|$|E
5000|$|Careful {{study of}} the remains {{suggests}} that their apparent similarity to ratites is misleading. They actually combine a number of traits not found in any known ratite lineage, and in particularly not in the ostriches and elephant birds (the only ratites biogeographically close to Eremopezus). Moreover, the prehistoric bird had several peculiar traits not at all found in ratites, but present in certain neognaths: its toes were widely divergent and could flex through {{a wide range of}} positions, while strong tendons gave the bird a firm grip. In the associated anatomical details, E. eocaenus resembled the secretarybird (<b>Sagittarius</b> <b>serpentarius)</b> and the shoebill (Balaeniceps rex), two rather singular African endemics.

50|$|There {{are reports}} of Verreaux's eagle-owls attacking even larger {{raptorial}} birds. A case of the Verreaux's eagle-owl killing an adult Pel's fishing owl in Botswana was verified. At roughly 2000 g in body mass, the fishing owl is of nearly {{the same size as}} the eagle-owl. Cases where they’ve attacked the nests of particularly large diurnal birds of prey have sometimes involved only nestlings being victimized, such as attacks on the hooded vulture (Necrosyrtes monachus) and the bateleur (Terathopius ecaudatus), none of the adults, which are about the same average adult body mass as the Verreaux's eagle-owls, have been reported as prey. However, in some even larger birds of prey, adults as well as nestlings and fledglings have been killed. Successful nighttime attacks have been reported on adults of the 2810 g African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer) and the 4017 g secretarybird (<b>Sagittarius</b> <b>serpentarius).</b> In the Matobo Hills of Zimbabwe, the Verreaux's eagle-owl has been considered as one of the inferred predators of 4195 g Verreaux's eagle (Aquila verreauxii), although whether adults or only nestlings are vulnerable is not definitely clear.|$|E

40|$|Data {{from two}} {{long-term}} citizen science projects {{were used to}} examine the status and ecology of a Red List species, the Secretarybird <b>Sagittarius</b> <b>serpentarius</b> (Vulnerable), in South Africa. The first phase of the Southern African Bird Atlas Project operated from 1987 until 1992, and the second phase began in 2007. The Coordinated Avifaunal Roadcounts (CAR) project began in 1993 and by 1998 had expanded to cover much of the south-eastern half of the country. Data submitted up until April 2013 were used. A new method of comparing reporting rates between atlas projects was developed. Changing reporting rates are likely to reflect changes in abundance; in this instance the data suggest that the Secretarybird population decreased across much of South Africa between the two atlas projects, with a widespread important decrease in the Kruger National Park. Habitat data from the CAR project were analysed to gain insight into the ecology of the species. Secretarybirds tended to avoid transformed habitats across much of the area covered by the CAR project. In the winter rainfall region of the Western Cape, which is characterised by heavily transformed fynbos vegetation, at least 50 % of Secretarybirds recorded were in transformed environments. This implies that in the Fynbos biome, at least, Secretarybirds have adapted to transformed environments to some degree. However, {{in the rest of the}} country it is likely that habitat loss, largely through widespread bush encroachment but also through agriculture, afforestation, and urbanisation, is a major threat to the species. The methods developed here represent a new approach to analysing data from long-term citize...|$|E

40|$|A posição sistemática da família Cathartidae (abutres do Novo Mundo) sempre foi motivo de muita discussão e apresenta divergências entre os sistematas, sendo debatida a proximidade dos representantes dos abutres do Novo Mundo entre as ordens Falconiformes e/ou Ciconiiformes. Muitos dos caracteres diagnósticos do grupo provêm de adaptações ao conspícuo hábito alimentar dessas aves, como bicos e pés fortes utilizados na dilaceração de carcaças; cabeça e pescoço desprovidos de penas que evitam o acúmulo de matéria orgânica em decomposição nestas regiões; e espesso colar de penas no pescoço que evita a passagem de líquidos provenientes da dieta às outras partes do corpo. Devido às similaridades na dieta, muitas dessas adaptações morfológicas são compartilhadas entre os catartídeos e os abutres do Velho Mundo (Gypaetinae e Aegypiinae; Accipitridae), gerando historicamente muita confusão na taxonomia dos grupos em questão. Visando contribuir com o conhecimento osteológico da família Cathartidae, bem como dos grupos historicamente relacionados, foram realizados: a) estudo de uma estrutura anatômica craniana (forâmen do nervo olfativo), criando subsídios para inferências acerca do comportamento alimentar dos representantes da família Cathartidae; e b) análises filogenéticas com base em uma ampla amostragem taxonômica (inclusive com táxons fósseis de Cathartidae), lançando hipóteses que elucidem problemas tanto em níveis intragenérico e intraespecífico da família Cathartidae. Além disso, foram feitas inferências acerca do posicionamento mais inclusivo do grupo em questão, sugerindo mudanças no sistema classificatório para que este seja filogeneticamente mais informativo. Da análise da anatomia do forâmen e sulco olfativos de Cathartidae, foi possível inferir que aves do gênero Cathartes possuem uma grande capacidade olfativa, indicando que a morfologia do forâmen do nervo olfativo e do sulco a ele associado são adaptações que promovem um melhor desempenho do olfato neste gênero. Dentre os resultados da análise cladística de 207 caracteres osteológicos (cranianos e pós-cranianos), foi recuperado o monofiletismo da família indicando a existência de duas linhagens distintas dentro do grupo. Quanto às relações mais inclusivas do grupo, a família mostrou-se como a divergência mais basal do componente que inclui Cathartidae e os demais Falconiformes. Foram feitas considerações acerca de algumas das relações entre os táxons historicamente relacionados a Cathartidae e recuperadas pela presente análise: <b>Sagittarius</b> <b>serpentarius,</b> aparentemente, é uma linhagem com divergência antiga dentro dos Falconiformes; confirmou-se o relacionamento {{adjacente}} de Pandion haliaetus à família Accipitridae; a separação do grupo de abutres do Velho Mundo em duas subfamílias não relacionadas (Aegypiinae e Gypaetinae) foi corroborada, indicando que o hábito de alimentação saprófago surgiu independentemente três vezes dentro da linhagem f̈alconiforme;̈ a relação próxima entre Scopidae e Balaeniciptidae foi corroborada; relações de Ardeidae aqui apresentadas corroboram as hipóteses de relacionamento mais recentes. Foram propostas atualizações nomenclaturais e hierárquicas, assim como uma nova proposta classificatória do grupo, onde se incluem os abutres do Novo Mundo: a elevação da categoria hierárquica deste grupo, sendo considerada a ordem Cathartiformes Seehbohm, 1890; dentro desta ordem foi proposta a criação de duas famílias, Cathartidae Lafresnaye, 1839 (incluindo os gêneros de ürubus verdadeiros-̈ Cathartes e Coragyps) e Vulturidae Illiger, 1811 (incluindo os gêneros de condores e o urubu-rei - Vultur, Gymnogyps, Breagyps+ e Sarcoramphus). The systematic {{position of}} the family Cathartidae (New World Vultures) {{has always been a}} motive for debate, and presents divergences among sistematists, the proximity of New World Vultures representatives between the orders Falconiformes and Ciconiiformes always being discussed. Most of the diagnosable characters of the group come from adaptations related to the conspicuous feeding behavior of these birds, such as strong beaks and claws used to dilacerate carcasses, featherless heads and necks to avoid carrion accumulation in these regions and a thick feather necklace that prevents the passage of liquids from food {{to other parts of the}} body. Due to these similarities in diets, most morphological adaptations are shared with the cathartid vultures and Old World Vultures (Gypaetinae and Aegypiinae; Accipitridae), historically causing much confusion in the taxonomy of these groups. With the aim of contributing to osteological knowledge of the family Cathartidae and historically related groups the following tasks were carried out: a) a study on anatomic cranial structure (olfactory nerve foramen), thus creating subsidies for inferences on the feeding behavior of Cathartidae representatives; and b) phylogenetic analyses based on an extensive taxonomic sample (including fossils of the Cathartidae), thereby launching hypotheses that elucidate problems up to the intrageneric and intraspecific levels, as inferences for the most inclusive systematic positioning of the group, and suggestions of changes in the classificatory system for this to become more phylogenetically informative. From the anatomic study of the foramen and olfactory sulcus of Cathartidae, it was possible to infer that birds of the Cathartes genus have great olfactory capacity, indicating that the morphology of the olfactory nerve and the furrow associated to it, are adaptations that promote better performance of olfaction in this genus. In the results on the cladistic analysis of 207 osteological characters (cranial and post-cranial) the monophyly of the family was recovered, this indicating the existence of two distinct lineages within the group. As to the most inclusive relationships of the group, the family appears as the basal divergence of the component that includes Cathartidae and the other Falconiformes. Considerations on certain of the relationships between the Cathartidae historically related taxa recovered by the present analysis: <b>Sagittarius</b> <b>serpentarius</b> is apparently a lineage with an ancient divergence inside the Falconiformes; the adjacent relationship of Pandion haliaetus to the Accipitridae was confirmed; the separation of the Old World Vultures assemblage into two non-related subfamilies was corroborated, indicating that the carrion eating habit appeared independently three times in the f̈alconiforml̈ineage; the close relationship between Scopidae and Balaenicipitidae was corroborated; relationships of Ardeidae presented here corroborate the most recent published hypotheses. Nomenclatural and hierarchical updating was put forward, as a new classificatory proposal of the group that includes the New World Vultures: the elevation of the hierarchical rank of the group, on considering the order Cathartiformes Seehbohm, 1890; in this order, the creation of two families, Cathartidae Lafresnaye, 1839 (including the ẗrue vulturesg̈enus - Cathartes and Coragyps) and Vulturidae Illiger, 1811 (including the condors and King Vultures genus - Vultur, Gymnogyps, Breagyps+ and Sarcoramphus),was proposed...|$|E
