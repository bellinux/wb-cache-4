Aggregation and/or traffic shaping is performed above the air interface protocol stacks but below the IP layer. We investigate the problem of minimizing the average packet latency (the sum of queuing delay and serving delay) under certain constraints and propose an algorithm to compute optimal packet distribution ratio across RATs to be implemented by OMMA. Moreover, we statistically characterize the reordering delay for the OMMA system and propose an algorithm to compute a modified optimal packet distribution ratio which minimizes the packet end-to-end delay, i. e., the sum of average packet latency and average packet reordering delay. Finally, some numerical results are presented to study the average packet latency, average packet reordering delay and average packet end-to-end delay for different system parameters.

Two hundred and sixty children aged 2 - 15 years, participated in this study. They were treated at the three government dental establishments in Ibadan, a city in southwestern Nigeria over a six-month period. The children’s behaviour during the different phases of treatment were determined by the Frankl’s Behaviour Rating Scale (Frankl et al, 1962). The findings revealed a direct relationship between the predicted behaviour and the actual manifested behaviour during dental appointments. During clinical examination 42. 7 % of presumed difficult children manifested positive behaviour in comparison to 95. 1 % whose mothers believed would be cooperative (p< 0. 05). In the process of administering local anaesthesia, 21. 9 % of children who had been predicted to be uncooperative by their mothers complied, while 63. 5 % of those expected to be of good behaviour showed a positive response (p< 0. 05). This study thus shows the importance of a mother being asked to make a prediction of the possible behaviour of her child before the dental treatment.

In {{the course}} of the {{financial}} crisis, the global geography of power has shifted from G 8 to G 20. The latter, although representing roughly two thirds of global trade, consists of relatively a small number of global players and is consequently excluding many others from decision-making at the international stage. Nevertheless, the G 20 has been successful in its reaction to the financial crisis and became therewith an important new player within the international community. When highlighting how the G 20 might interfere with the WTO, the panel voiced concerns over the political legitimacy of the G 20, given the limited number of members and the global impact of its decisions. It agreed on the impression that although the G 20 intends to extend its debates from the financial sector to world economy in general, it has so far little achieved in this direction, {{particularly when it comes to}} moving the Doha agenda forward. It remains, thus, open how the G 20 will evolve in the coming few years, and what mandates it will shed or adopt. So far, the G 20 has complemented the WTO and international financial institutions in handling the financial crisis. Yet, even if there is little evidence pointing towards a less cooperative role in the future, the desirability of a G 20 commitment in WTO trade negotiations has yet to be debated. The panel concluded by providing ideas on how the potential of the G 20 might be used to serve global interests even better in the future. In their concluding remarks, the panellists agreed that it remains to be seen whether or not the G 20 will further broaden its agenda. Given the ebbing away of the financial crisis there is even the question whether the G 20 will remain an important international forum for financial collaboration, or whether it has already served its cause and will eventually disappear from the international stage. The Chair concluded the well attended and lively panel with voicing the hope that the two international bodies – the G 20 and the WTO – will work in a positive way together in the future and face the challenges and opportunities in their collaboration to the benefit of everyone...|$|E

Methods. Using the APEX telescope, we mapped the molecular emission in the CO(2 - 1), 							 13 CO(2 - 1), C 18 O(2 - 1), and 13 CO(3 - 2) lines in a region of about 5 ′ × 5 ′ in size around the bubble. The cold dust distribution was analyzed using submillimeter continuum images from ATLASGAL and Herschel. Complementary IR and radio data at different wavelengths were used to complete the study of the interstellar medium in the region. 							Results. The molecular gas distribution shows that gas linked to the S 24 bubble, G 341. 220 - 0. 213, and G 341. 217 - 0. 237 has velocitiesbetween – 48. 0 km s− 1 							and – 40. 0 km s− 1, compatible with a kinematical distance of 3. 7 kpc generally adopted for the region. The gas distribution reveals a shell-like molecular structure of ∼ 0. 8 pc in radius bordering the S 24 bubble. A cold dust counterpart of the shell 							is detected in the LABOCA and Herschel-SPIRE images. The presence of weak extended emission at 24 µm from warm dust and radio continuum emission projected inside the bubble indicates the existence of exciting sources and that the bubble is a compact Hii region. Part of the molecular gas bordering the S 24 Hii region coincides with the extended infrared dust cloud SDC 341. 194 - 0. 221. 							A molecular and cold dust clump is present at the interfase between the S 24 Hii region and G 341. 217 - 0. 237, <b>shapping</b> the eastern border of the IR bubble. As regards G 341. 220 - 0. 213, the presence of an arc-like molecular structure encircling the northern and eastern sections of this IR source indicates that G 341. 220 - 0. 213 is interacting with the molecular gas. The {{analysis of the}} available IR point source catalogs reveals the existence of young stellar objects (YSO) candidates linked to the IR extended sources, thus confirming its nature as active star-forming regions. Gas and dust masses were estimated for the different features. The total gas mass 							in the region and the H 2 ambient density amount to 10300 M⊙ and 5900 cm− 3 							, indicating that G 341. 220 - 0. 213, G 341. 217 - 0. 237, and the S 24 Hii region are evolving in a high density medium.
