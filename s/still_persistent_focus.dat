40|$|Several DNA damage {{checkpoint}} factors form nuclear foci {{in response}} to ionizing radiation (IR). Although {{the number of the}} initial foci decreases concomitantly with DNA double-strand break repair, some fraction of foci persists. To date, the physiological role of the <b>persistent</b> <b>foci</b> has been poorly understood. Here we examined foci of Ser 1981 -phosphorylated ATM in normal human diploid cells exposed to 1 Gy of X-rays. While the initial foci size was approximately 0. 6 microm, the one or two of <b>persistent</b> <b>focus</b> (foci) grew, whose diameter reached 1. 6 microm or more in diameter at 24 h after IR. All of the grown <b>persistent</b> <b>foci</b> of phosphorylated ATM colocalized with the <b>persistent</b> <b>foci</b> of Ser 139 -phosphorylated histone H 2 AX, MDC 1, 53 BP 1, and NBS 1, which also grew similarly. When G 0 -synchronized normal human cells were released immediately after 1 Gy of X-rays and incubated for 24 h, the grown large phosphorylated ATM foci (> or = 1. 6 microm) were rarely (av. 0. 9 %) observed in S phase cells, while smaller foci (< 1. 6 microm) were frequently (av. 45. 9 %) found. We observed significant phosphorylation of p 53 at Ser 15 in cells with a single grown phosphorylated ATM <b>focus.</b> Furthermore, <b>persistent</b> inhibition of <b>foci</b> growth of phosphorylated ATM by an ATM inhibitor, KU 55933, completely abrogated p 53 phosphorylation. Defective growth of the <b>persistent</b> IR-induced <b>foci</b> was observed in primary fibroblasts derived from ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) patients, which were abnormal in IR-induced G 1 checkpoint. These results indicate that the growth of the <b>persistent</b> <b>foci</b> of the DNA damage checkpoint factors plays a pivotal role in G 1 arrest, which amplifies G 1 checkpoint signals sufficiently for phosphorylating p 53 in cells with a limited number of remaining foci...|$|R

40|$|Telomeres are {{specialized}} nucleoprotein structures, which protect chromosome {{ends and}} have been implicated in the ageing process. Telomere shortening {{has been shown to}} contribute to a persistent DNA damage response (DDR) during replicative senescence, the irreversible loss of division potential of somatic cells. Similarly, <b>persistent</b> DDR <b>foci</b> can be found in stress-induced senescence, although their nature is not understood. Here we show, using immuno-fluorescent in situ hybridization and ChIP, that up to half of the DNA damage foci in stress-induced senescence are located at telomeres irrespective of telomerase activity. Moreover, live-cell imaging experiments reveal that all <b>persistent</b> <b>foci</b> are associated with telomeres. Finally, we report an age-dependent increase in frequencies of telomere-associated foci in gut and liver of mice, occurring irrespectively of telomere length. We conclude that telomeres are important targets for stress in vitro and in vivo and this has important consequences for the ageing process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: {{we aim to}} {{describe}} our medium-term follow-up of 20 patients with an endoleak following repair of their abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) using the Endovascular Technologies (EVT) device. Design: the experience of one centre in a prospective multicentre phase II trial. Materials and methods: 55 patients with an endovascular repair of their AAA and at least 6 months» follow-up were reviewed. Intraoperative angiograms, next day duplex scans and computed tomography (CT) images were used to detect endoleaks. Follow-up with CT and duplex was performed at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Persistent endoleaks at 6 months were evaluated by angiography and treated by endovascular coiling. Results: there were three immediate conversions to open procedures. Twenty of 52 (38 %) patients had an endoleak identified initially. One patient died from a myocardial infarction and three were not evident any longer by discharge CT. Sixteen endoleaks (31 %) were present at discharge. Nine resolved spontaneously by 3 – 6 months and seven were <b>still</b> <b>persistent</b> at 6 months (14 %). Six patients underwent coiling of their leak, all with successful radiographic seal after 1 – 3 sessions.

40|$|DNA damage can {{induce a}} tumor suppressive {{response}} termed cellular senescence. Damaged senescent cells permanently arrest growth, secrete inflammatory cytokines and other proteins and harbor <b>persistent</b> nuclear <b>foci</b> that contain DNA damage response (DDR) proteins. To understand how <b>persistent</b> damage <b>foci</b> differ from transient foci that mark repairable DNA lesions, we identify sequential events that differentiate transient <b>foci</b> from <b>persistent</b> <b>foci,</b> which we term ‘DNA segments with chromatin alterations reinforcing senescence’ (DNA-SCARS). Unlike transient foci, DNA-SCARS associate with PML nuclear bodies, lack the DNA repair proteins RPA and RAD 51, lack single-stranded DNA and DNA synthesis and accumulate activated {{forms of the}} DDR mediators CHK 2 and p 53. DNA-SCARS form independently of p 53, pRB and several other checkpoint and repair proteins but require p 53 and pRb to trigger the senescence growth arrest. Importantly, depletion of the DNA-SCARS-stabilizing component histone H 2 AX did not deplete 53 BP 1 from DNA-SCARS but diminished the presence of MDC 1 and activated CHK 2. Furthermore, depletion of H 2 AX reduced both the p 53 -dependent senescence growth arrest and p 53 -independent cytokine secretion. DNA-SCARS were also observed following severe damage to multiple human cell types and mouse tissues, suggesting {{that they can be}} used in combination with other markers to identify senescent cells. Thus, DNA-SCARS are dynamically formed distinct structures that functionally regulate multiple aspects of the senescent phenotype...|$|R
