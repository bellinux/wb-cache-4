5|$|Although the {{liberalization}} of sexuality in American film had increased during the 1920s, the pre-Code era is either dated {{to the start of}} the <b>sound</b> <b>film</b> era, or more generally to March 1930, when the Hays Code was first written. Over the protests of NAMPI, New York became the first state to take advantage of the Supreme Court's decision in Mutual Film vs. Ohio by instituting a censorship board in 1921. Virginia followed suit the next year, and eight individual states had a board by the advent of <b>sound</b> <b>film.</b>|$|E

5|$|This was {{the first}} <b>sound</b> <b>film</b> {{released}} by Tan's, but far from {{the first in the}} Indies. The earliest sound films released in the Indies, Fox Movietone Follies of 1929 and The Rainbow Man, were both shown in 1929. The following year, a domestic part-talkie, G. Krugers' Karnadi Anemer Bangkong, was also released, becoming the first domestic <b>sound</b> <b>film.</b> Two other directors had followed with full-talkies in 1931: The Teng Chun with Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang and the Wong brothers with Indonesia Malaise. In order to ensure the quality of the sound, Tan's hired Krugers and his single-system camera to do the cinematography and sound direction for this black-and-white film.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, the {{documentary}} Más allá del silencio La tragedia gave {{an overview of}} the work done by the Acevedo family.

5|$|A <b>sound</b> <b>film</b> is {{a motion}} picture with {{synchronized}} sound, or sound technologically coupled to image, {{as opposed to}} a silent film. The first known public exhibition of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900, but decades passed before sound motion pictures were made commercially practical. Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early sound-on-disc systems, and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate. Innovations in sound-on-film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology, which took place in 1923.|$|E

5|$|Film records survive of two Gettysburg reunions, {{held on the}} battlefield. At the 50th anniversary (1913), {{veterans}} re-enacted Pickett's Charge in {{a spirit}} of reconciliation, a meeting that carried great emotional force for both sides. At the 75th anniversary (1938), 2500 veterans attended, and there was a ceremonial mass hand-shake across a stone wall. This was recorded on <b>sound</b> <b>film,</b> and some Confederates can be heard giving the Rebel Yell.|$|E
5|$|Robert Kurrle (February 2, 1890 – October 27, 1932), {{also known}} as Robert B. Kurrle, was an American cinematographer during the silent and early talking film eras. Prior to {{entering}} the film industry, he was already experimenting with aerial photography. Considered a very prominent cinematographer, even his early work received notice and praise from both critics and other industry professionals. The advent of <b>sound</b> <b>film</b> did not abate his continued rise, and he became the top director of photography at Warner Brothers by 1932.|$|E
5|$|Snow White premiered at the Carthay Circle Theatre on December 21, 1937, {{followed}} by a nationwide release on February 4, 1938. It was a critical and commercial success, and with international earnings of $8 million during its initial release briefly assumed the record of highest-grossing <b>sound</b> <b>film</b> at the time.

5|$|The Testament of Dr. Mabuse {{was based}} on {{elements}} of author Norbert Jacques' unfinished novel Mabuse's Colony. It was Lang's second <b>sound</b> <b>film</b> for Nero-Film and was his final collaboration {{with his wife and}} screenwriter Thea von Harbou. To promote the film to a foreign market, a French-language version of the film was made by Lang with the same sets but different actors with the title Le Testament du Dr. Mabuse.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} <b>sound</b> <b>film</b> would {{drastically}} alter the studio's course: Negotiations {{that began in}} late 1927 with the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) on a deal for sound conversion led to RCA purchasing a major interest in FBO in January 1928. Four months later, {{as part of a}} strategy conceived with RCA head David Sarnoff, Kennedy acquired control of Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO), a vaudeville exhibition chain with approximately one hundred theaters across the United States, and with the Pathé Exchange and Cecil B. De Mille's Producers Distributing Corporation under its control.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} <b>sound</b> <b>film</b> {{created a new}} job market for writers of screen dialogue. Many {{newspaper}} journalists moved to California and became studio-employed screenwriters. This resulted {{in a series of}} fast-talking comedy pictures featuring newsmen. The Front Page, later re-made as the much less cynical and more sentimental post-Code His Girl Friday (1940), was adapted from the Broadway play by Chicago newsmen, and Hollywood screenwriters, Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. It was based on Hecht's experiences working as a reporter for the Chicago Daily Journal.|$|E

5|$|The first <b>sound</b> <b>film</b> {{based on}} Sullivan's play was a 1931 version, {{produced}} {{and directed by}} Rouben Mamoulian and distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film's writers, Samuel Hoffenstein and Percy Heath, followed much of Sullivan's storyline, adding a female companion for Hyde similar to Robertson's 1920 version. Hoffenstein and Heath were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and the cinematographer Karl Struss was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. Fredric March won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Jekyll and Hyde.|$|E
5|$|The only item of note {{to emerge}} from No Sirree! was Robert Benchley's contribution, The Treasurer's Report. Benchley's disjointed parody so delighted those in {{attendance}} that Irving Berlin hired Benchley in 1923 to deliver the Report as part of Berlin's Music Box Revue for $500 a week. In 1928, Report was later made into a short <b>sound</b> <b>film</b> in the Fox Movietone sound-on-film system by Fox Film Corporation. The film {{marked the beginning of}} a second career for Benchley in Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Vampyr was {{challenging}} for Dreyer {{to make as}} {{it was his first}} <b>sound</b> <b>film</b> and had to be recorded in three languages. To overcome this, very little dialogue was used in the film and much of the story is told with silent film-styled title cards. The film was shot entirely on location and to enhance the atmospheric content, Dreyer opted for a washed out, soft focus photographic technique. The audio editing was done in Berlin where the character's voices, sound effects, and score were added to the film.|$|E

2500|$|Dane & Arthur's last silent short was Detectives in 1928. On 23 December 1928 {{their first}} talkie, Brotherly Love was released. By this time, <b>sound</b> <b>films</b> were rising in {{popularity}} and MGM {{was worried that}} actors with thick foreign accents would not be ideal for <b>sound</b> <b>films.</b> In his memoirs, George K. Arthur claimed that after MGM tested the duo for <b>sound</b> <b>films,</b> they felt his British accent was [...] "more desirable" [...] while Dane's thick Danish accent made his English difficult for audiences to understand. As a result, MGM began offering Dane fewer roles. Dane & Arthur made only six more talkies, ending with China Bound in 1929.|$|R
50|$|These {{were the}} years in which film studios were making a {{transition}} from silent <b>films</b> to <b>sound</b> <b>films</b> and this version of Show Boat was made as a silent film. The studio panicked when they realized that audiences might be expecting a sound version of Show Boat now that <b>sound</b> <b>films</b> had become so popular, and the film was temporarily withheld from release.|$|R
5|$|Complicating {{matters for}} the studios, {{the advent of}} <b>sound</b> <b>film</b> in 1927 {{required}} an immense expenditure in sound stages, recording booths, cameras, and movie-theater sound systems, {{not to mention the}} new-found artistic complications of producing in a radically altered medium. The studios were in a difficult financial position even before the market crash as the sound conversion process and some risky purchases of theater chains had pushed their finances near the breaking point. These economic circumstances led to a loss of nearly half of the weekly attendance numbers and closure of almost a third of the country's theaters in {{the first few years of}} the depression. Even so, 60 million Americans went to the cinema weekly.* McElvaine (Vol 1), pg. 448.|$|E
5|$|German cinema {{has made}} major {{technical}} and artistic contributions to film. The first {{works of the}} Skladanowsky Brothers were shown to an audience in 1895. The renowned Babelsberg Studio in Berlin's suburb Potsdam was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world. Today it is Europe's largest studio. Other early and still active studios include UFA and Bavaria Film. Early German cinema was particularly influential with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Director Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) {{is referred to as}} the first major science-fiction film. In 1930 Josef von Sternberg directed The Blue Angel, the first major German <b>sound</b> <b>film,</b> with Marlene Dietrich. Films of Leni Riefenstahl set new artistic standards, in particular Triumph of the Will.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, an American Roman Catholic layman Martin Quigley, {{editor of}} the {{prominent}} trade paper Motion Picture Herald, and Father Daniel A. Lord, a Jesuit priest, created a code of standards (which Hays liked immensely), and submitted it to the studios. Lord's concerns centered on the effects <b>sound</b> <b>film</b> had on children, whom he considered especially susceptible to their allure. Several studio heads, including Irving Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), met with Lord and Quigley in February 1930. After some revisions, they agreed to the stipulations of the Code. One of the main motivating factors in adopting the Code was to avoid direct government intervention. It was {{the responsibility of the}} Studio Relations Committee, headed by Colonel Jason S. Joy, to supervise film production and advise the studios when changes or cuts were required.|$|E
50|$|The {{last days}} of photoplay music were of the era of 1927-1930, when <b>sound</b> <b>films</b> became popular. Silent films already made were {{generally}} released with orchestral soundtracks compiled of photoplay music and sound effects. Some photoplay music was used as incidental music in early <b>sound</b> <b>films</b> as well. Most theaters, however, threw out entire libraries of music. Publishers junked overstock or used it as scrap paper.|$|R
50|$|In 1928, Anna Nilsson {{made her}} last {{film of the}} silent era, Blockade. With the {{introduction}} of <b>sound</b> <b>films,</b> Nilsson's career went into a sharp decline, although she continued to play small, often uncredited parts in films into the 1950s. Between 1930 and 1950, she participated in 39 <b>sound</b> <b>films,</b> in smaller roles. She {{played the role of}} the Swedish immigrant mother of Loretta Young in The Farmer's Daughter (1947).|$|R
