40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{has been}} {{investigating}} new techniques to improve the of mineral to recover water lost in the waste slurry, and to produce dewatered solid dewatering s suitable for disposal. As part of this investigation, a study was undertaken to investigate the feasibility of dewatering Alaska placer effluent. Based on the laboratory tests, preliminary field tests were conducted on three placer mines in Alaska. At these mines, the water recovered from the placer effluent (250 to 23, 000 NTU) exhibited turbidities of 20 to 240 NTU. In {{the second year of}} the project, a large-scale dewatering unit was set up at a mine located in the Livengood district. The feed, at flow rates up to 935 gpm, was mixed with dilute PEO solution in a flexible plastic hose with and without static mixers. Feed to the dewatering unit generally ranged between 300 and 26, 500 NTU and required PEO dosages of 0. 02 to 0. 14 lb per 1, 000 gal to produce water from the <b>screen</b> <b>underflow</b> with turbidities of 20 to 50 NTU. During this period, a small unit was also operated at Dow rams of 10 to 25 gpm at sewn sites throughout Alaska, with the effluent from four of the sites being dewatered successfully...|$|E
40|$|Gekko Systems has {{developed}} a process, using its InLine Leach Reactor, to recover gold metal from a complex gold copper gravity concentrate produced by Hargraves Resources at Brown’s Creek. The process involves intensive cyanidation under controlled conditions followed by gold recovery onto Aurix®, a proprietary weak base resin. The resin selectively recovers gold from the mixed gold copper leach solution. The loaded resin is stripped with caustic solution in a single step to provide a solution for electrowinning. From a concentrate containing about 15000 ppm gold and 6 % copper, over 95 % of the total gold will be recovered into an 80 % gold bar. BACKGROUND Hargraves Resources operates a gold copper mine at Brown’s Creek, NSW, Australia. The mine treats 450, 000 t/y of ore containing 5. 6 g/t gold and 0. 4 % copper, producing about 72, 000 oz/y of gold and 1500 t/y copper using a mixture of gravity and flotation. Overall gold recovery is about 90 %. The mill has a gravity recovery circuit comprising one 30 inch Knelson treating <b>screened</b> cyclone <b>underflow.</b> This produces a high grade gold concentrate containing 1 to 4 % gold and 5 to 7 % copper, which is upgraded on a table with recoveries of about 70 %. This gravity circuit recovers about 50 % o...|$|R
