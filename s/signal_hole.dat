On the one hand, based on the multi-dimensional connected graph, the density continuous jitter problem of the sensor network is solved effectively. Sensor density prediction method improves the efficiency of random deployment of sensor nodes. Based on the above schemes, the sensor deployment density sensing model is proposed. On the other hand, according to the regional geometry, diversity of the sensor network channel and density can detect the time domain channel impulse response signal successfully. Finally, the network signal is detected by the signal detection of the mobile crowd network. The signal holes can be detected and repaired based on coverage density and crowd. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has outstanding performance in terms of signal strength and signal void ratio compared with the energy-aware repair algorithm...|$|E
