25|$|Boardman's three pence {{rotogravure}} series began {{monthly production}} in February 1948. Issues were twelve pages long and used both {{front and back}} covers as story pages. They were printed in three colours (generally black, white, and red or green) on clay coated paper and <b>saddle-stitched</b> at the spine. In American publishing, they most closely resemble Will Eisner's Spirit Sunday newspaper inserts. Mildly inspired by Alex Raymond, Denis and Colin filled the first seven issues with the adventures of detective Roy Carson and adventure/science fiction hero Swift Morgan alternately. Although titles changed with each issue, numbering remained consistent to the entire series. Issue eight saw the addition of Lennart Ek's Buffalo Bill reprinted from a Swiss source but always repackaged by Denis. Eventually, Denis would create some original Buffalo Bill stories for the series but his involvement with other projects for Boardman caused the reprint content of the rotogravure series to increase. Still holding the rights to material from Quality Comics, Blackhawk (at least sixteen issues) and the Spirit (probably only two issues) {{were added to the}} rotation of titles. These reprints were always repackaged by Denis McLoughlin. The twelve-page rotogravure format lasted for 44 issues until October 1951. In February 1953, the series numbering continued but with color covers and black & white interiors until probably sometime in 1954. It seems possible that number 61, featuring Blackhawk, was the last issue. Rebound newsagent returns of the rotogravure series were released as Super Colour Annuals (there were three, 1949–1951).|$|E
2500|$|Atkinson's second Hindu-sounding pseudonym, Swami Bhakta Vishita, {{billed as}} [...] "The Hindoo Master" [...] was not authentically Hindu, {{nor did he}} write {{on the topic of}} Hinduism. His best-known titles, which have {{remained}} in print for many years after entering the public domain, were [...] "The Development of Seership: The Science of Knowing the Future; Hindoo and Oriental Methods" [...] (1915), [...] "Genuine Mediumship, or Invisible Powers", and [...] "Can We Talk to Spirit Friends?" [...] Atkinson produced more than two dozen Swami Bhakta Vishita books, plus a half-dozen <b>saddle-stitched</b> paper pamphlets under the Vishita name. All of them dealt with clairvoyance, mediumship, and the afterlife. Like Ramacharaka, Vishita was listed as a regular contributor to Atkinson's Advanced Thought magazine, but his books were published by the Advanced Thought Publishing Company, not by the Yogi Publication Society, which handled the Ramacharaka titles.|$|E
50|$|By {{editorial}} policy, {{the covers}} of the <b>saddle-stitched</b> booklets never depict people. Instead they usually feature photos of natural outdoor scenes.|$|E

5000|$|By {{its third}} issue PC was square-bound {{because it was}} too thick for <b>saddle-stitch.</b> At first the {{magazine}} published new issues every two months, but became monthly as of the August 1982 issue, its fourth. In March 1983 a reader urged the magazine to consider switching to a biweekly schedule because of its thickness, and in June another joked of the dangers of falling asleep while reading PC in bed. Although the magazine replied to the reader's proposal with [...] "Please say you're kidding about the bi-weekly schedue. Please?", after the December 1983 issue reached 800 pages in size, in 1984 PC began publishing new issues every two weeks, with each about 400 pages in size. In January 2008 the magazine dropped back to monthly issues. Print circulation peaked at 1.2 million in the late 1990s. In November 2008 it was announced that the print edition would be discontinued as of the January 2009 issue, but the online version at pcmag.com would continue. By this time print circulation had declined to about 600,000.|$|R
50|$|The centerfold or centrefold of a {{magazine}} refers to a gatefolded spread, usually a portrait such as a pin-up or a nude, inserted {{in the middle of}} the publication, or to the model featured in the portrait. In <b>saddle-stitched</b> magazines (as opposed to those that are perfect-bound), the centerfold does not have any blank space cutting through the image.|$|E
50|$|For issue 137, and all {{subsequent}} 100-page editions, a new binding format and magazine size was introduced.

The following issue retained the size, but returned to saddle-stitching. With this issue, the UK edition lost its 100-page length, becoming 68 pages long.|$|E

50|$|In 1933, Gaines {{devised the}} first four-color, <b>saddle-stitched</b> {{newsprint}} pamphlet, {{a precursor to}} the color-comics format that became the standard for the American comic book industry.

It was written by little-known author James Edison Northford. The <b>saddle-stitched</b> novel was based (more or less) on the comic strip story lines, and included color illustrations reminiscent of Alex Raymond's artwork. On the back pages a second installment, The Sun Men of Saturn, was promised, but it never saw print. Even though the series did not gain in popularity, the lone issue of Flash Gordon Strange Adventure Magazine has become a much sought-after item for pulp magazine collectors.|$|E
50|$|Juvenilia Press {{was founded}} in 1994 by Emeritus Professor Juliet McMaster, a {{distinguished}} 19th Century literary scholar, at the University of Alberta. Starting as a classroom enterprise, Juliet McMaster and her students produced a <b>saddle-stitched</b> pamphlet edition of Jane Austen's Jack and Alice, a story Austen wrote at about age thirteen. From this simple start an offer to edit a previously unpublished early writing of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu transformed the classroom exercise into a working press. In 2001, the Juvenilia Press moved to UNSW where it has remained under the general-editorship of Scientia Professor Christine Alexander who has on the Juvenilia Press board from its inception.|$|E
50|$|The publication, {{delivered}} in a 64-page, <b>saddle-stitched,</b> digest-sized format, soon saw {{a dramatic increase in}} sales. By 1923, the magazine had a circulation of 425,000 with $500,000 annual profits. With the rising readership of Captain Billy's Whiz Bang, Fawcett racked up more sales with Whiz Bang annuals, and in 1926, he launched a similar publication, Smokehouse Monthly. The popularity of Whiz Bang peaked during the 1920s. It continued into the 1930s, but circulation slowed as readers graduated to the more sophisticated humor of Esquire, founded in 1933. It had an influence on many other digest-sized cartoon humor publications, including Charley Jones Laugh Book, which was still being published during the 1950s.|$|E

In 1997, Hypercult Publishing released an abridged electronic version of the game that revised the game to use a similar skill vs. difficulty task resolution system that was based on d12 instead of d20.

40|$|This is a {{book review}} of James Conner, David Scott, and Bonnie Thurston, "The Voice of the Stranger. " "The Voice of the Stranger is a {{compilation}} of three essays and a Eucharistic homily from the Seventh General Meeting and Conference of the Thomas Merton Society of Great Britain and Ireland, which took place on April 4 - 6, 2008 at Oakham School, the boarding school that Merton attended in his adolescence. The Voice of the Stranger is only 58 pages and <b>saddle-stitched,</b> making it feel more like an issue of a journal than a book. I will, therefore, use the term "booklet" to describe it. As the title suggests, its central theme is that of "the stranger. " Each of the three authors addresses that general theme in a radically different way. There are, however, unifying threads. Each author challenges stereotypical ideas about who {{is and is not}} a "stranger," in ways that allow Merton to speak to situations that deeply haunt the world today. James Conner, OCSO, {{is the author of the}} first essay, entitled "The Voice of the Stranger: A Manifesto for the 21 st Century. " The goal of this manifesto, in Conner's mind, is unity. In the second essay, entitled "Brothers in Prayer and Worship: The Merton/Aziz Correspondence, An Islamic-Christian Dialogue," Bonnie Thurston changes the course of the volume to address interreligious dialogue. Thurston generally introduces the history and content of the fraternal correspondence between Merton and Abdul Aziz (34 letters, ranging from November 1960 until April 1968). The third essay, "The Poet as Stranger," is David Scott's treatment of a theme that neither of the other authors developed in detail: Merton as stranger. To illustrate Merton's "strangeness," Scott discusses the influences on and content of Merton's poetry (as well as its role in the formation of Merton's faith) ...|$|E
