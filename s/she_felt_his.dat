5|$|Seaborg kept a daily journal from 1927 {{until he}} {{suffered}} a stroke in 1998. As a youth, Seaborg was both a devoted sports fan and an avid movie buff. His mother encouraged {{him to become a}} bookkeeper as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> literary interests were impractical. He did not take an interest in science until his junior year when he was inspired by Dwight Logan Reid, a chemistry and physics teacher at David Starr Jordan High School in Watts.|$|E
5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E
2500|$|Bodenheimer (1979, pp 299–300) {{believes}} that the narrator {{is interested in the}} psychology of her characters: their inner selves, how their contentious interactions with others subconsciously reveal their beliefs and how the changes they experience reflect their negotiation of the outside world. Matus (2007, pp.35–43) also focuses on Gaskell's depiction of [...] "interiority" [...] (the psychic process), expressed in dreams and trances such as Thornton's dream of Margaret as a temptress or the rioters' [...] "trance of passion". The phrase [...] "as if" [...] appears over 200 times, suggesting Gaskell's reluctance to appear too definitive in her narration (O'Farrell, 1997, p 16): [...] "Bessy, who had sat down on the first chair, as if completely tired out with her walk" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 11) and [...] " [...] spoke as if this consequence were so entirely logical" [...] (chapter 19). The phrase is primarily used when exploring the characters' sensations and feelings: [...] "As if <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> look, she turned to him" [...] (chapter 22); [...] "He had shaken off his emotion as if he was ashamed of ever giving way to it" [...] (chapter 28), and [...] "She lifted up her head, as if she took pride in any delicacy of feeling which Mr. Thornton had shown" [...] (chapter 39). Gaskell uses it when exploring the unconscious process that allows Thornton, whose suffering in love disturbs his composure and control of his feelings, to communicate with Higgins (Matus, 2007, p 40): [...] " ... and then the conviction went in, as if by some spell, and touched the latent tenderness of his heart" [...] (chapter 39).|$|E

60|$|There was a pause. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> in <b>his</b> power. <b>She</b> {{had heard}} the ring in his voice. It frightened her.|$|R
60|$|Millicent laughed; though <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>his</b> {{rejoinder}} did {{not adequately}} express his feelings, his humorous manner set her at ease.|$|R
60|$|Rachel {{knelt down}} by the litter of shields and looked at Richard's face. The stamp of death was on it. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> hand, it was turning cold; <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> heart, it did not beat.|$|E
60|$|In the {{darkness}} <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> arms about her. Louise {{and her husband}} had wandered away.|$|E
60|$|But her {{surrender}} {{made him}} think of her. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> effort to let her go.|$|E

50|$|He is also {{spoken of}} by Kerry during the film, {{describing}} the guilt that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> after <b>his</b> disappearance and having hallucinations of him.|$|R
50|$|Rateb was {{critical}} of former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>his</b> rule created a greater divide {{between the rich and}} poor.|$|R
60|$|She {{held him}} with {{her hands in the}} darkness, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> body again with hers.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> breast heave as {{he lifted}} her off her feet to kiss her awkwardly, boyishly.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> forehead, altered {{a bandage}} for a moment, {{and took his}} wrist between her fingers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, all right," [...] {{replied the}} young man with red hair absently. Sally was looking {{straight}} in front of her, but <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>his</b> eyes were still busy.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> {{strong arms}} closing round her, his lips seeking hers, her eyes, her hair, her {{clinging}} hands, which dragged at his shoulders {{in a wild}} agony of despair.|$|R
60|$|The captain spoke encouragingly {{as he led}} {{his wife}} to the cabin, but his candid countenance spoke too truthfully, and <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>his</b> look of anxious concern bade her fear the worst.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a moment}} of silence in which <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> grasp slowly tighten--the heave of his breast.|$|E
60|$|He came {{up quite}} close, and {{took hold of}} her wrists gently. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> breath on her ear.|$|E
60|$|He {{pressed his}} lips to hers; he breathed over her a {{thousand}} blessings; <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> tears trickling on her neck.|$|E
60|$|Something in {{his eyes}} sent a slight thrill of fear through her. It was not an {{unpleasant}} sensation--rather exhilarating. She watched the passing street till <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>his</b> eyes were no longer devouring her.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>felt</b> for <b>his</b> hand again, {{and this}} time he allowed it to remain stiffly in her grasp. It was like being grudgingly {{recognized}} by somebody very dignified who had his doubts about you but reserved judgment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{send for}} a doctor," [...] he pleaded. [...] "Let me rest--just here--I {{will soon be}} better." [...] His face touched her own and <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>his</b> eyes were moist. A tear rolled down between their cheeks.|$|R
60|$|Leland {{had only}} one free hand, but he slipped it round her waist. She sighed contentedly as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> {{protecting}} clasp.|$|E
60|$|Upon the words, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> {{encircling}} arms turn limp, {{and relax}} their grip upon her, whereupon {{she clung to}} him the more tightly.|$|E
6000|$|Lister {{took her}} hand, and <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> {{was thin and}} hot. [...] "I'm paid for all! But, Barbara, I think you're logical When I'm better--?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I do then. I {{will get}} my own living, {{and not be}} a burthen, where my brother cannot forgive a broken glass or a moment's fright,' said Leonard; and <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>his</b> calm resentment was worse than his violence.|$|R
60|$|Glenn {{laughed in}} a way which proved to Carley that he knew {{perfectly}} well how <b>she</b> <b>felt.</b> Again <b>his</b> smile caused her self-reproach. Plain indeed was it that he had really expected more of her in the way of complaint and less of fortitude. Carley bit her lips.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>His</b> Eminence's eyes {{watching}} her every movement. She threw him a defiant look, then peremptorily ordered the major-domo and the pages to precede her.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked into}} her eyes, holding her hand, and <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> body trembling. She knew {{he was about to}} speak, and held up a warning hand.|$|E
60|$|Alma's hands lay limply in her lap, and {{her eyes}} were cast down, with tears glistening on the long fair lashes. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> gaze on her.|$|E
60|$|Somebody {{had brought}} a lantern, and Dane felt {{inclined}} to gasp {{when he saw the}} girl's white face, but what <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> was not <b>his</b> business then.|$|R
60|$|Moore squared around aggressively. He {{seemed to}} fortify himself against {{something}} in her. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> that. But <b>his</b> face grew harder and {{older than she}} had ever seen it.|$|R
60|$|She had {{not seen}} him--but <b>she</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> presence--and <b>she</b> was quite sure that she had heard the hissing sound of his indrawn breath and the {{movement}} which he had made to spring on her--and strangle her, as he had threatened to do--if she went out by the front door.|$|R
