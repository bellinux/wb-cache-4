40|$|By {{evaluation}} of direct electrocardiographic leads {{from the right}} atrium and <b>semidirect</b> esophag-eal <b>leads</b> from the left atrium, "atriodiagrams " have been constructed for both atria. The spread of activation in the atria has been studied under normal conditions {{as well as in}} cases of mitral heart disease, cor pulmonale, etc. In cases of doubtful enlargement of the left atrium, esophageal electrocardiograms may be helpful for diagnosis. In six cases of auricular flutter the results were not uniform. T HE DEVELOPMENT of cardiac cath-eterization " 2 has enabled various au-thors 3 -' 5 to investigate the human heart by direct electrocardiography. In the present paper we have used this method for recording the potentials of the inside of the right atrium. Also the introduction of esophageal leads into clinical electrocardiographyl 6 - 38 has opened a wide field of research. These leads are especially valuable in studying the left atrium since they constitute <b>semidirect</b> <b>leads</b> of this chamber. Our investigations were performed by means of ordinary cardiac catheters which contain a wire and so represent an electrode. For esophageal leads we used an electrode with a selector switch, which enabled us to take 11 leads from different points in the esophagus without moving the electrode. 39 Ten normal subjects and 40 patients with various cardiac diseases were studied. An essential feature of direct and <b>semidirect</b> <b>leads</b> from atrial muscle is the intrinsic de-flection of the P wave. The theory of Lewis that these deflections correspond to the time when activation passes the electrode has been attacked by various authors. Recent experi-mental findings, however, speak in favor of the opinion that it is not inaccurate to use the intrinsic deflections in both intracardiac and esophageal leads as an indication of the tim...|$|R

40|$|The {{maturation}} of pre-rRNA (precursor to rRNA) in liver nuclei is {{studied by}} agar/ureagel electrophoresis, kinetics of labelling in vivo with [14 C] orotate and electron-microscopic observation of secondary structure of RNA molecules. (1) Processing starts from primary pre-rRNA molecules with average mol. wt. 4. 6 X 10 (6) (45 S) containing the segments of both 28 S and 18 S rRNA. These molecules form a heterogeneous peak on electrophoresis. The 28 S rRNA segment is homogeneous in its secondary structure. However, the large transcribed spacer segment (presumably at the 5 '-end) is heterogeneous {{in size and}} secondary structure. A minor early labelled RNA component with mol. wt. about 5. 8 X 10 (6) is reproducibly found, but {{its role as a}} pre-rRNA species remains to be determined. (2) The following intermediate pre-rRNA species are identified: 3. 25 X 10 (6) mol. wt. (41 S), a precursor common to both mature rRNA species; 2. 60 X 10 (6) (36 S) and 2. 15 X 10 (6) (32 S) precursors to 28 S rRNA; 1. 05 X 10 (6) (21 S) precursor to 18 S rRNA. The pre-rRNA molecules in rat liver are identical in size and secondary structure with those observed in other mammalian cells. These results suggest that the endonuclease-cleavage sites along the pre-rRNA chain are identical in all mammalian cells. (3) Labelling kinetics and the simultaneous existence of both 36 S and 21 S pre-rRNA reveal that processing of primary pre-rRNA in adult rat liver occurs simultaneously by at least two major pathways: (i) 45 <b>S</b> <b>leads</b> to 41 <b>S</b> <b>leads</b> to 32 S+ 21 <b>S</b> <b>leads</b> to 28 S+ 18 S rRNA and (ii) 45 <b>S</b> <b>leads</b> to 41 <b>S</b> <b>leads</b> to 36 S+ 18 <b>S</b> <b>leads</b> to 32 <b>S</b> <b>leads</b> to 28 <b>S</b> rRNA. The two pathways differ by the temporal sequence of endonuclease attack along the 41 S pre-rRNA chain. A minor fraction (mol. wt. 2. 9 X 10 (6), 39 S) is identified as most likely originating by a direct split of 28 S rRNA from 45 S pre-rRNA. These results show that in liver considerable flexibility exists in the order of cleavage of pre-rRNA molecules during processing...|$|R
40|$|S INCE 1906, when Cremer (1) first re-ported {{use of an}} intra-esophageal elec-trocardiographic electrode, such {{electrodes}} {{have been}} intermittently employed {{for the study of}} cardiac mechanisms. Because the esophagus is anatomically located close by the left atrium, a properly placed esophag-eal electrode is virtually a <b>semidirect</b> <b>lead</b> to the left atrium and electrocardiograms recorded from this position have very large P-waves. The P-waves are frequently small and difficult to identify in routine electro-cardiograms recorded from body-surface electrodes, especially in complex cardiac mechanisms. In recent years, the unipolar esophageal lead has been used more fre-quently in the diagnosis of cardiac arrhyth-mias with encouraging results (2 - 6). A simple unipolar salt-bridge esophageal electrode was devised in our laboratory some years ago, and tracings recorded with this technique were marked by minimal erratic base line behavior (7). A bipolar salt-bridge esophageal electrode was then designed and constructed and has been used clinically at this institution for more than 5 years. In addition to exceptional base line stability, the bipolar salt-bridge esophageal lead possesses other unique properties. When properly positioned in the esophagus, this lead enlarges the P-waves while simultaneously cancelling the QRS complexes; this greatly increases the ratio of the amplitude of P-waves to the amplitude of the QRS complexes and thus results in electrocardiograms characterized by maximum P-wave visibility. Further-more, the bipolar electrode is very sensitive to small changes in the direction of atrial depolarization and thus facilitates recogni-tion of ectopic atrial depolarization. Principles of esophageal electrocardiog-raphy and the results of clinical evaluation of the bipolar salt-bridge esophageal lead have been published previously (8, 9). The bipolar esophageal lead has been applied to the study of complex cardiac mechanisms (10, 11). It is the purpose of this presenta-tion to further illustrate the technical ex-cellence of electrocardiograms recorded by this technique and especially to emphasize the practical clinical application of eso-phageal electrocardiography...|$|R
