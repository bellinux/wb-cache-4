5|$|Waste {{management}} including sewage treatment, the linked {{processes of}} deforestation and soil degradation, {{and climate change}} or global warming are the major environmental problems in Nigeria. Waste management presents problems in a mega city like Lagos and other major Nigerian cities which are linked with economic development, population growth and the inability of municipal councils to manage the resulting rise in industrial and domestic waste. This huge waste management problem is also attributable to unsustainable environmental management lifestyles of Kubwa Community in the Federal Capital Territory, where there are habits of indiscriminate disposal of waste, dumping of waste along or into the canals, sewerage <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> channels for water flows, etc.|$|E
5|$|Water {{efficiency}} is being improved {{on a global}} scale by increased demand management, improved infrastructure, improved water productivity of agriculture, minimising the water intensity (embodied water) of goods and services, addressing shortages in the non-industrialized world, concentrating food production in areas of high productivity, and planning for climate change, such as through flexible system design. A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> flexible and reversible. At the local level, people are becoming more self-sufficient by harvesting rainwater and reducing use of mains water.|$|E

5|$|Some birds, {{especially}} corvids and parrots, {{are among}} the most intelligent animals; several bird species make and use tools, and many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. Many species annually migrate great distances. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and bird songs, and participating in such social behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous (referring to social living arrangement, distinct from genetic monogamy), usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have breeding <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> polygynous (arrangement of one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (arrangement of one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. Some birds, such as hens, lay eggs even when not fertilised, though unfertilised eggs do not produce offspring.|$|E
5|$|When the hyperthermophilic archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius {{are exposed}} to the DNA {{damaging}} agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced. Aggregation in S.solfataricus could not be induced by other physical stressors, such as pH or temperature shift, suggesting that aggregation is induced specifically by DNA damage. Ajon et al. showed that UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency in S.acidocaldarius. Recombination rates exceeded those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species specific DNA transfer between Sulfolobus cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination. This response may be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> also associated with species specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage.|$|E
5|$|Within the Southern Pacific basin in the Southern Hemisphere between 160°E– 120°W, a {{tropical}} cyclone is named when observations or Dvorak intensity analysis {{indicate that a}} system has gale force or stronger winds near the center which are forecast to continue. The Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) names <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> located between the Equator and 25°S, while the New Zealand MetService names systems (in conjunction with the FMS) that develop {{to the south of}} 25°S. If {{a tropical}} cyclone causes loss of life or significant damage and disruption to the way of life of a community, then the name assigned to that cyclone is retired from the list of names for the region. A replacement name is then submitted to the next World Meteorological Organization's RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee meeting. The name of a tropical cyclone is determined by using Lists A— D in order, without regard to year before restarting with List A. List E contains names that will replace names on A-D when needed.|$|E
