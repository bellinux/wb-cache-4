5000|$|Mower {{manufacturers}} {{market their}} mowers as <b>side</b> <b>discharge,</b> 2-in-1, meaning bagging and mulching or side discharging and mulching, and 3-in-1, meaning bagging, mulching, and <b>side</b> <b>discharge.</b> Most 2-in-1 bagging and mulching mowers require a separate attachment to discharge grass onto the lawn. Some <b>side</b> <b>discharge</b> mower manufacturers also sell separate [...] "mulching plates" [...] that {{will cover the}} opening on the <b>side</b> <b>discharge</b> mower and, {{in combination with the}} proper blades, will convert the mower to a mulching mower. These conversions are impractical when compared with 2- or 3-in-1 mowers which can be converted in the field in seconds. There are two types of bagging mowers. A rear bag mower features an opening {{on the back of the}} mower through which the grass is expelled into the bag. Hi-vac mowers have a tunnel that extends from the <b>side</b> <b>discharge</b> to the bag. Hi-vac is also the type of grass collection used on some riding lawn mowers and lawn tractors and is suitable for use in dry conditions but less suitable for long wet lush grass as they often clog up. Mulching and bagging mowers are not well suited to long grass or thick weeds. In some ride-on mowers, the cut grass is dropped onto the ground and then collected by a set of rotating bristles, allowing even long, wet grass to be collected.|$|E

The Kukatpally Nalla was seen to be discharging a mix of domestic sewage and industrial effluents into the lake from the northern side. This practice of discharging municipal sewage, industry effluents and storm-water from over 240 square kilometres increased the content of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus. This suspended organic matter, rich in nutrients, caused eutrophication that allowed growth of algal blooms and water hyacinth.|$|E

In DBD, the formation of <b>side</b> <b>discharges</b> is generally supposed to be a key factor responsible for diversity and spatial-temporal symmetry breaking of pattern formation. However, it is still not clear how such discharges are induced. Here, we present the observations of <b>side</b> <b>discharges</b> in a filamentary dielectric barrier discharge from both numerical simulations and experiments. Two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations with Monte Carlo collisions included have revealed formation dynamics of <b>side</b> <b>discharges,</b> suggesting that transverse plasma diffusion and ion induced secondary electron emission play critical roles.

Large road-portable plants can crush concrete and asphalt rubble at 600 tons per hour or more. These systems normally consist of a rubble crusher, <b>side</b> <b>discharge</b> conveyor, screening plant, and a return conveyor from the screen to the crusher inlet for reprocessing oversize materials. Compact, self-contained mini-crushers are also available that can handle up to 150 tons per hour and fit into tighter areas. With the advent of crusher attachments - those connected to various construction equipment, such as excavators - the trend towards recycling on-site with smaller volumes of material is growing rapidly. These attachments encompass volumes of 100 tons/hour and less.|$|E
50|$|The {{military}} caracole {{was developed}} by both the 13th century mongols of Genghis Khan and also the Han Chinese military. It was later adapted by European militaries in the mid-16th century {{in an attempt to}} integrate gunpowder weapons into cavalry tactics. Equipped with one or more wheellock pistols or similar firearms, cavalrymen would advance on their target at less than a gallop in formation as deep as 12 ranks. As each rank came into range, the soldiers would turn their mount slightly to one <b>side,</b> <b>discharge</b> one pistol, then turn slightly to the other side to discharge another pistol at their target. The horsemen then retired {{to the back of the}} formation to reload, and then repeat the manoeuvre. The whole caracole formation might move slowly forward as each rank fired to help press the attack, or move slowly back for to avoid an enemy's advance. Despite this complex manoeuvring, the formation was kept dense rather than open, as the cavalrymen were generally also armed and armoured for melee, and hoped to follow the caracole with a charge. The tactic was accompanied by the increasing popularity of the German reiter in Western armies from about 1540.|$|E

Zaji and Bonakdari (2014) compared the performance of Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN), Radial Basis Neural Network (RBNN), and linear and non-linear PSO based equations in modeling the modified <b>side</b> weir <b>discharge</b> coefficient. The authors concluded that the RBNN model has higher performance compare with the other regression methods in simulating the considered <b>side</b> weir <b>discharge</b> coefficient. Zaji et al.

Bonakdari et al. (2015) used ANFIS as sensitivity analyzer to find the most appropriated input variables in simulating the discharge {{coefficient of}} the present side weir. Zaji et al. (2016 b) applied two types of Support Vector Machine (SVM) to simulate the considered modified side weir. In the first type, the radial basis kernel function is used and in the second type, the polynomial kernel function is employed. In addition, the sensitivity analysis on the input variables was done by examining six different input combinations. The results showed that both types of SVM method perform better when higher number of input variables are used and the radial basis kernel function performs better compare with the polynomial kernel function. Zaji et al. (2016 a) compared the firefly based SVM with the simple SVM in simulating the present <b>side</b> weir <b>discharge</b> coefficient.

Iodine dissociation fraction generated in the <b>side</b> <b>discharge</b> and measured in the laser cavity is up to 50 %. However, the experiments showed that additional iodine dissociation generated in the <b>side</b> <b>discharge</b> only moderately increases laser gain, by 10 - 15 %. Parametric gain optimization by varying main discharge pressure, O 2 and NO fractions in the flow, I 2 flow rate, pulsed discharge frequency, and sustainer discharge power, with the <b>side</b> <b>discharge</b> in operation produces gain up to 0. 08 %/cm. Two parameters that critically affect gain are the energy loading per molecule in the discharge and the NO flow rate controlling the O atom concentration in the flow. In particular, operation at the main discharge pressure of 60 torr results in significantly higher gain than at 100 torr, 0. 080 %/cm vs. 0. 043 %/cm, due to high discharge energy loading per molecule at the lower pressure. Laser output power measured at the gain optimized conditions is 1. 4 W...|$|E

PCFLOW 2 D is a two-dimensional depth-averaged model which calculates turbulent flow in open channels.

40|$|Keeping {{inventory}} record of packed grains in silos poses challenges since the bulk material’s different segments do not discharge uniformly, leading to formation of random {{peaks and valleys}} on the surface. To facilitate obtaining accurate volume measurement of the grains by taking into account this non-linear behavior on the surface, laser or plumb-bob level-sensing devices are employed at {{different part of the}} surface to probe the level of material under those regions. The main goals of this research is to study the behavior of granular material in silo while discharging downward and by doing so, differentiate certain flow patterns formed during this process which could be important in predicting granular materials’ behavior on the surface. In order to conduct this thesis study, three unique numerical discharge models were built with two types of granular material and assigned to these, were the material/mechanical properties of polyethylene plastic and corn kernels separately. Validation procedures were conducted (grain volume measurements) by setting up a physical silo in the lab and monitoring center and <b>side</b> <b>discharge</b> developments for real polyethylene and maize grains, sequentially.

The underground mines are operated at shallow to moderate depths. Asia's largest and oldest underground manganese mine is being operated by MOIL at Balaghat, Madhya Pradesh. Horizontal cut and fill mining with passive timber square set support has been replaced with advanced technique of pre-mining support by Cable bolting for reinforcement underground structures.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the dynamic response of a pressurized water pipeline system {{is important for the}} design and also the integrity monitoring of these systems. An efficient method for summarizing the behavior of a pipeline system is through the determination of their system response functions. These functions can be extracted by injecting a pressure signal with a wide bandwidth that persists over the length of a pipeline system. Unlike electrical and mechanical systems, generating such signals in pressurized water systems is difficult. Valves capable of generating a signal against the system back-pressure often lack the necessary maneuverability to ensure the signal is sharp and hence with high-frequency content and the generated transient is often large in amplitude, risking damage to the system. A method for generating a small amplitude transient signal with a wide band of frequencies is desirable. This paper presents the design for a <b>side</b> <b>discharge</b> valve for generating a pseudorandom binary sequence of pressure changes that are of a small magnitude in relation to the steady state head of the pipeline. The pseudorandom pressure sequence is used to provide an estimate of the system response function. The continuous form of the signal allows the amplitude of each individual pulse within the signal to be small while maintaining the same signal bandwidth. The valve has been tested experimentally and was found to provide a good match with the theoretical response of the pipeline. The method provides a practical alternative to frequency sweeping using sinusoidal signals or sharp valve closures for the extraction of the response functions. Once determined, the system response function can be utilized to detect system faults such as leaks and blockages. Pedro J. Lee; John P. Vítkovský; Martin F. Lambert; and Angus R. Simpso...|$|E

40|$|The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) {{proposed}} about {{decades ago}} {{has been developed}} and applied to simulate various complex fluids. It has become an alternative powerful method for computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Although most research on the LBM focuses on the Navier-Stokes equations, the method has also been developed to solve other flow equations such as the shallow water equations. In this thesis, the lattice Boltzmann models for the shallow water equations and solute transport equation have been improved and applied to different flows and environmental problems, including solute transport and morphological evolution. In this work, both the single-relaxation-time and multiple-relaxation-time models are used for shallow water equations (named LABSWE and LABSWEMRT, respectively), and the large eddy simulation is incorporated into the LABSWE (named LABSWETM) for turbulent flow. The capability of the LABSWETM was firstly tested by applying it to simulate free surface flows in rectangular basins with different length -width ratios, in which {{the characteristics of the}} asymmetrical flows were studied in details. The LABSWEMRT was then used to simulate the one- and two-dimensional shallow water flows over discontinuous beds. The weighted centred scheme for force term, together with the bed height for a bed slope, was incorporated into the model to improve the simulation of water flows over a discontinuous bed. The resistance stress was also included to investigate the effect of the local head loss caused by flows over a step. Thirdly, the LABSWEMRT was extended to simulate a moving body in shallow water. In order to deal with the moving boundaries, three different schemes with second-order accuracy were tested and compared for treating curved boundaries. An additional momentum term was added to reflect the interaction between the following fluid and the solid, and a refilled method was proposed to treat the wetted nodes moving out from the solid nodes. Fourthly, both LABSWE and LABSWEMRT were used to investigate solute transport in shallow water. The flows are solved using LABSWE and LABSWEMRT, and the advection-diffusion equation for solute transport was solved with a LBM-BGK model based on the D 2 Q 5 lattice. Three cases: open channel flow with a <b>side</b> <b>discharge,</b> shallow recirculation flow and flow in a harbour, were simulated to verify the methods. In addition, the performance of LABSWEMRT and LABSWE were compared, and the results showed that the LABSWMRT has better stability and can be used for flow with high Reynolds number. Finally, the lattice Boltzmann method was used with the Euler-WENO scheme to simulate morphological evolution in shallow water. The flow fields were solved by the LABSWEMRT with the improved scheme for the force term, and the fifth order Euler-WENO scheme was used to solve the morphological equation to predict the morphological evolution caused by the bed-load transport...|$|E

The phenomenon whereby the capacitor on DC <b>side</b> <b>discharges</b> quickly during a DC fault {{contributes to a}} large short-circuit fault current. Neither traditional DC breakers nor DC switches can cut off the fault current under this condition. A fast solid state DC breaker design method is proposed in this paper.

At this point, by coordinating the AC breakers near the rectifier, the DC breaker could reliably cut off the DC fault current and protect the system. A detailed model for this fast solid state DC breaker and its operation sequence are studied, based on this design method.

Since a one dimensional formulation with plane wave assumption to calculate transmission loss is not applicable for small mufflers (ratio of length to diameter is less than 1), a numerical methodology was established and validated using an impedance tube. Detailed three dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to further study the pressure drop across the mufflers for a given flow and compressor operating frequency. In the proposed new methodology, the pressure distribution is observed {{as a function of}} frequency and an optimal position of inlet and outlet pipes is decided to improve transmission loss.
