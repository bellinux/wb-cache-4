David Rigler vividly remembered an occasion when he and Genie passed {{a father and a}} young boy carrying a toy firetruck without speaking to each other, and said the boy suddenly turned around and gave the firetruck to Genie. Curtiss also recalled one time when, while she and Genie were walking and had stopped at a busy intersection, she unexpectedly heard a purse emptying; she turned to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> stop at the intersection and exit her car to give Genie a plastic purse, even though Genie had not said anything. To take full advantage of her nonverbal communication abilities, in 1974 the Riglers arranged for her to learn a form of sign language.|$|E
500|$|Daniel D'Addario from Time {{called the}} movie [...] "clunky and ridiculous", but also called it [...] "a rare movie about women" [...] and [...] "the Bad Movie Hollywood Needs Right Now," [...] adding that: [...] "Lopez's new [...] project {{represents}} an earnest attempt {{to capitalize on}} a very real public [...] hunger to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> {{at the center of}} a mainstream movie—not an indie, but an old-fashioned popcorn flick. Can either the boy-centric Best Picture nominees or the elusive Best Actress pictures say that? If every director, at every level of ambition, were making [...] commercially ambitious movies about [...] women, The Boy Next Door wouldn't feel so perversely refreshing. But its director is one of very few who actually did." ...|$|E

500|$|Film {{producer}} Joel Silver {{has said}} that after working as scriptwriters on Assassins, the Wachowskis made Bound as an [...] "audition piece" [...] {{to prove that they}} knew what to do on a movie set. Conversely, Lana Wachowski has said Joel [...] "made that up." [...] The Wachowskis themselves claim they [...] "decided simply to focus on making their own directorial debut." [...] They had the idea to write a story about how one might <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> on the street and make assumptions about her sexuality, but how those assumptions might be wrong. They wanted to play with stereotypes and make an entertaining film that contained sex and violence, because {{those are the kinds of}} films that they like to watch. Seeing film noir as a genre within which they could tell a contained story and twist conventions, they described Billy Wilder as a big influence.|$|E
500|$|The Chicago Tribune {{noted the}} {{controversy}} surrounding the album cover, stating that Ice-T {{had been charged with}} perpetuating stereotypes with an album cover featuring a scantily clad woman. The Sydney Morning Herald described the cover as a [...] "violence-glorifying, women-denigrating sleeve". The woman on the cover was Darlene Ortiz, Ice-T's girlfriend at the time. In 1989, the Los Angeles Daily News stated that: [...] "Darlene has become {{as much a part of}} Ice-T's image as gangs, guns and boom boxes." [...] Ortiz originally met Ice-T when she was 17, stating she was [...] "totally smitten and ready to settle down" [...] and that she [...] "would've done whatever he asked". Of her appearance on the album cover she explained that it was [...] "like nothing" [...] for her. To prepare for the cover, Ortiz bought five different bathing suits and went to the photo studio with Glen E. Friedman. Ortiz felt comfortable with the sawed-off shotgun, stating that she got her first gun when she was 11 years old and that she thought [...] "it would be a powerful statement to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> holding a gun". Ice-T chose the bathing suit and the red high heel pumps and earrings for the cover. Clothing on the cover was shared between shots. Ortiz and DJ Evil E both shared the gold bracelet for the photo shoot and Ice-T and DJ Evil E wore the same Rolex. Ortiz also appeared in music videos for the singles from Power – [...] "I'm Your Pusher" [...] and [...] "High Rollers".|$|E
500|$|During September 2008, Ferraro gained {{attention}} {{yet again}} after the announcement of Sarah Palin as the Republican vice-presidential nominee, the first such major party bid for a woman since her own in 1984. Palin mentioned Ferraro as well as Clinton as forerunners in her introductory appearance. In reaction to the nomination, Ferraro said, [...] "It's great to be the first, but I don't {{want to be the}} only. And so now it is wonderful to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> on a national ticket." [...] Ferraro speculated that the pick might win Republican presidential nominee John McCain the election, but said that she was supporting Obama now due to his running mate selection of Joe Biden having resolved her concerns about Obama's lack of experience in certain areas. Ferraro criticized the media's scrutiny of Palin's background and family as gender-based and saw parallels with how she was treated by the media during her own run; a University of Alabama study also found that media framing of Ferraro and Palin was similar and often revolved around their nominations being political gambles. A Newsweek cover story detected a change in how women voters responded to a female vice presidential candidate from Ferraro's time to Palin's, but Ferraro correctly predicted that the bounce that McCain received from the Palin pick would dissipate. In a friendly joint retrospective of her 1984 debate with George H. W. Bush, Ferraro said she had had more national issues experience in 1984 than Palin did now, but that it was important that Palin make a good showing in her vice presidential debate so that [...] "little girls [...] see someone there who can stand toe to toe with [...]" [...] McCain and Palin ended up losing, but regardless of the 1984 or 2008 election result, Ferraro said that [...] "Every time a woman runs, women win." [...] Ferraro made a joint appearance with Palin on Fox News during the network's election-night coverage of the 2010 midterms.|$|E

That there even exists such ambiguity with respect to what is transpiring on the canvas is remarkable. According to the founders of Cubist theory, objects possess no absolute or essential form.

2500|$|Juan Manuel Blanes, the Uruguayan {{painter who}} lived in Buenos Aires, painted an oil on canvas (currently in Montevideo) called The Episode of the Yellow Fever, {{reproduced}} in this article, inspired by one done during the tragedy, probably on 17 March 1871 in Balcarce Street.

2500|$|In her own day, Christine de Pizan was {{primarily}} a court writer who wrote commissioned works for aristocratic families, as well as addressing literary debates of the era. In modern times, she has been labeled a poetic mediator who engaged with historical texts to interpolate her royal readers and encourage ethical and judicious conduct. Some rhetorical scholars have concluded, from studying her persuasive strategies, that she forged a rhetorical identity for herself and encouraged women to embrace this identity. Some have argued that Christine de Pizan [...] "began her literary career by singing, alone in her room, and she finished by shouting in the public square." [...] She left an influential footprint {{in the field of}} rhetorical discourse in an otherwise male-dominated literary field. She left forty-one surviving poetic works and a number of prose books. Simone de Beauvoir wrote in 1949 that Épître au Dieu d'Amour was [...] "the first time we <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> take up her pen in defence of her sex".|$|E

2500|$|The {{impact of}} the bicycle on female {{emancipation}} should not be underestimated. The safety bicycle gave women unprecedented mobility, contributing to their larger participation {{in the lives of}} Western nations. As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom they embodied, and so the bicycle came to symbolise the New Woman of the late nineteenth century, especially in Britain and the United States. Feminists and suffragists recognised its transformative power. Susan B. Anthony said, [...] "Let me tell you what I think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. I stand and rejoice every time I <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> ride by on a wheel...the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood." [...] In 1895 Frances Willard, the tightly laced president of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, wrote a book called How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle (described in Bicycling magazine as [...] "the greatest book ever written on learning to ride"), in which she praised the bicycle she learned to ride late in life, and which she named [...] "Gladys", for its [...] "gladdening effect" [...] on her health and political optimism. Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action, proclaiming, [...] "I would not waste my life in friction when it could be turned into momentum." [...] Elizabeth Robins Pennell started cycling in the 1870s in Philadelphia, and from the 1880s onwards brought out a series of travelogues about her cycling journeys around Europe, from A Canterbury Pilgrimage to Over the Alps on a Bicycle. In 1895 Annie Londonderry became the first woman to bicycle around the world.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Yellow Wallpaper" [...] {{provided}} feminists {{the tools}} {{on how to}} interpret literature in different ways. Lanser says the short story was a [...] "particularly congenial medium for such a re-vision [...] [...] [...] because the narrator herself engages in a form of feminist interpretation when she tries to read the paper on her wall". The narrator in the story {{is trying to find}} a single meaning in the wallpaper. [...] At first she focuses on contradictory style of the wallpaper: it is [...] "flamboyant" [...] while also [...] "dull", [...] "pronounced" [...] yet also [...] "lame" [...] and [...] "uncertain" [...] (p.13). [...] She takes into account the patterns and tries to geometrically organize them, but she is further confused. [...] The wallpaper changes colors when it reflects light and emits a distinct odor which Jane cannot recognize (p.25). At night the narrator is able to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> behind bars within the complicated design of the wallpaper. Lanser argues that Jane was able to find [...] "a space of text on which she can locate whatever self-projection". Lanser creates a relationship between the narrator and the reader. Just like the narrator as a reader, when one comes into contact with a confusing and complicated text, one tries to find one single meaning. [...] "How we were taught to read" [...] as Lanser puts it, is why a reader cannot fully comprehend the text. The patriarchal ideology has kept many scholars from being able to interpret and appreciate stories such as [...] "The Yellow Wallpaper." [...] Thanks to feminist criticism, [...] "The Yellow Wallpaper" [...] has become a fundamental reading in the standard curriculum. Feminists have made a great contribution to the study of literature but, according to Lanser, are falling short because [...] "we acknowledge the participation of women writers and readers in dominant patterns of thought and social practice then perhaps our own patterns must also be deconstructed if we are to recover meanings still hidden or overlooked.|$|E
