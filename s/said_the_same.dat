Eginton wrote the bass lines for [...] "Violence of the Red Sea", inspired by funk and [...] "prog-psych" [...] bands from the UK and Europe. The song, which had {{been included in the}} band's concert setlist {{for the last few years}} prior to recording, was named after the combination of riffs and tempos which [...] "collid together like an angry sea". The song's finale was present in the band's repertoire for almost a decade and was used to close the song for the tension it created, whereas the opening of the song was considered more of a [...] "laid back groove". After Rubalcaba and Eginton had outlined the song's bass guitar and drum parts in Mitchell's absence (due to now living elsewhere), Mitchell was allowed to improvise lead guitar over them when he was able to play with the duo.|$|E
