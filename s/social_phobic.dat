50|$|Another study {{aimed to}} examine the link between social {{inhibition}} and social phobia also found that social phobia {{is linked to the}} <b>social</b> <b>phobic</b> being able to recall their own encounters with social inhibition during childhood. The <b>social</b> <b>phobic</b> participants were able to recall social and school fears from their childhood, but they also were able to recall sensory-processing sensitivity which indicates that the <b>social</b> <b>phobic</b> participants in the study were able to recall having increased sensitivity to the situations and behaviors around them.|$|E
50|$|Social phobics {{display a}} {{tendency}} to recall negative emotions about a situation when asked to recall the event. Their emotions typically revolve around themselves, with no recollection of other people's environments.

Social phobics typically displayed better recall than control participants. However, individuals with social anxiety recalled angry faces rather than happy or neutral faces better than control participants.|$|E
50|$|Social phobia, {{or social}} anxiety {{disorder}} (SAD), is a disorder in which individuals are experienced with overwhelming levels of fear in social situations and interactions. Individuals with social phobia tend to adopt strategic avoidance of social interactions, which makes it challenging for them to disclose themselves to others and reveal emotions. Self-disclosure {{is the key to}} foster intimate relationship, in which individuals can receive needed social supports. Close friendship and romantic relationship are two major sources for social supports, which have protective effect and {{play a crucial role in}} helping individuals with social phobia to cope with distress. Due to the profound impacts of the anxiety disorder, it has been found that late marriage or staying unmarried for the lifetime is prevailing among population with social phobia. This is problematic, because being unable to gain needed social supports from intimate ones further confines the <b>social</b> <b>phobic</b> in the loneliness and depression that they have been suffering from. In response to the problem, Sparrevohn and Rapee suggest that improving communication skill, particularly self-disclosure and emotional expression, should be included in future social phobia treatment, so the life quality of individuals with social phobia can be improved.|$|E
40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>phobics,</b> anxious {{controls}} and non-patient controls {{took part in}} a brief videotaped conversation with a stooge in order to investigate the cognitive model of social phobia.

40|$|Recently, a {{differential}} {{recruitment of}} brain areas throughout the distributed neural system for face perception {{has been found}} in <b>social</b> <b>phobic</b> patients as compared to healthy control subjects. These functional abnormalities in <b>social</b> <b>phobic</b> patients extend beyond emotion-related brain areas, such as the amygdala, to include cortical networks that modulate attention and process other facial features, and they are also associated with an alteration of the task-related activation/deactivation trade-off. Functional connectivity is becoming a powerful tool to examine how components of large-scale distributed neural systems are coupled together while performing a specific function. This study was designed to determine whether functional connectivity networks among brain regions within the distributed system for face perception also would differ between <b>social</b> <b>phobic</b> patients and healthy controls. Data were obtained from eight <b>social</b> <b>phobic</b> patients and seven healthy controls by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

To our knowledge, this is the first study that shows that functional connectivity during brain response to socially relevant stimuli differs between <b>social</b> <b>phobic</b> patients and healthy controls. These results expand our previous findings and indicate that brain functional changes in <b>social</b> <b>phobic</b> patients are not restricted to a single specific brain structure, but rather involve a mis-communication among different sensory and emotional processing brain areas...|$|E

40|$|Background. The paper {{describes}} prevalence, impairments, {{patterns of}} co-morbidity and other correlates of DSM-IV social phobia in {{adolescents and young}} adults, separating generalized and non-generalized <b>social</b> <b>phobics.</b> Methods. Data are derived from the baseline investigation of the Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology Study (EDSP), a prospective longitudinal community study of 3021 subjects, aged 14 – 24. Diagnoses {{were based on the}} DSM-IV algorithms of an expanded version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Results. Lifetime prevalence of DSM-IV/CIDI social phobia was 9 · 5 % in females and 4 · 9 % in males, with about one-third being classified as generalized <b>social</b> <b>phobics.</b> Twelve-month prevalence was only slightly lower, indicating considerable persistence. Respondents with generalized social phobia reported an earlier age of onset, higher symptom persistence, more co-morbidity, more severe impairments, higher treatment rates and indicated more frequently a parental history of mental disorders than respondents with non-generalized social phobia. Conclusions. History of DSM-IV social phobia was found to be quite prevalent in 14 – 24 year-olds. The generalized subtype of social phobia was found to have different correlates and to be considerably more persistent, impairing and co-morbid than non-generalized social phobia.

40|$|Background: Recent {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} {{the role of}} right-sided anterior temporal and prefrontal activation during anxiety, yet no study has been performed with <b>social</b> <b>phobics</b> that assesses regional brain and autonomic function. This study compared electroencephalograms (EEGs) and autonomic activity in <b>social</b> <b>phobics</b> and controls while they anticipated making a public speech. Methods: Electroencephalograms from 14 scalp loca-tions, heart rate, and blood pressure were recorded while 18 DSM-IV <b>social</b> <b>phobics</b> and 10 controls anticipated making a public speech, as well as immediately after the speech was made. Self-reports of anxiety and affect were also obtained. Results: Phobics showed a significantly greater increase in anxiety and negative affect during the anticipation condition compared with controls. Heart rate was elevated in the phobics relative to the controls in most conditions. Phobics showed a marked increase in right-sided activa-tion in the anterior temporal and lateral prefrontal scalp regions. These heart rate and EEG changes together accounted for. 48 % {{of the variance in}} the increase in negative affect during the anticipation phase. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis of right-sided anterior cortical activation during anxiety and indicate that the combination of EEG and heart rate changes during anticipation account for substantial vari-ance in reported negative affect.

40|$|Clark and Wells (1995) {{constructed}} a comprehensive cognitive model of <b>social</b> <b>phobic</b> behaviour, {{in terms of}} which <b>social</b> <b>phobic</b> behaviour is activated and maintained by a system consisting of negative thoughts and beliefs, anxiety s) mptoms, avoidance and safety behaviours, and processing of self as a social object. The interaction of these elements creates a series of vicious circles which escalate and which keep the phobic individual {{in a state of}} chronic -disability, either because they chronically avoid significant social situations or because they find themselves incapacitated by anxiety when they enter them. The Clark and Wells (1995) treatment programme is designed to alleviate the social phobia by targeting the components that form the vicious maintenance cycle and replacing these by new patterns of cognition and behaviour. This treatment programme was designed for individual treatment, and the present study adapted it to a group format. Seven <b>social</b> <b>phobic</b> university students participated in the adapted group treatment format over the course of 13, 2 -hour group sessions. Regular assessment of participants' response to the programme was carried out weekly and at two follow-up assessments, {{with the use of a}} series of questionnaires.

Only 5 % of <b>social</b> <b>phobic</b> patients seek treat-ment, despite numerous related complications when the disorder goes untreated. It is advisable, therefore, that clinicians be prepared to recognize and effectively manage patients with this anxiety disorder. We provide a brief review of the assessment, differential diagnosis and pharmacological treatment of social phobia. We based our suggestions for treatment on the results of randomized clinical trials found in the PUB-MED/MEDLINE database from 1966 to February of 2001 as well as on our clinical experience with <b>social</b> <b>phobic</b> patients. Of the three classes of drugs with established efficacy in the treatment of social phobia (irre-versible MAOIs, SSRIs and benzodiazepines) the SSRIs are considered the treatment of choice because of their tolerability, side effect profile and safety.

In Erwartung einer erhöhten Konditionierbarkeit, einer Extinktionsresistenz sowie einer Generalisierung auf störungsrelevante Fazialreize bei den Sozialphobikern wurden die konditionierten Reaktionen über subjektiv-verbale Urteile (Valenz, Erregung, Kontingenz), den Schreckreflex (M. orbicularis oculi links, Indikator subcorticaler Reizverarbeitung der Angst), die {{bilateral}} erhobene Aktivität des M. corrugator supercilii (Indikator für den negativ emotionalen Fazialausdruck) sowie die Herzrate (Indikator der allgemeinen psychophysiologischen Aktivierung) gemessen. Die Konditionierung verlief in beiden Experimentalgruppen erfolgreich (Valenz, Erregung, Kontingenz) und hypothesenkonform. Im Gegensatz zu den Gesunden resultierten für die Sozialphobiker eine erhöhte Konditionierbarkeit (Schreckreflexlatenz und -amplitude, Herzratendezeleration), eine Extinktionsresistenz (Erregung, Schreckreflexnullreaktionen, Corrugator) sowie eine Reizgeneralisierung (Erregung, Kontingenz, Schreckreflexlatenz, Corrugator, Herzratendezeleration). Die Befunde sprechen außerdem für eine unterschiedliche emotionale Reizverarbeitung über den Experimentalverlauf. Die Sozialphobiker reagierten in der Akquisition vorrangig in den Parametern Erregung, Kontingenz, Schreckreflex und Herzrate (Gesunde: Corrugator) sowie in der Extinktion hinsichtlich Erregung, Schreckreflex und Corrugator (Gesunde: Kontingenz).

The aim {{of this investigation was}} to examine the hypotheses of enhanced acquisition, delayed extinction and generalization of faces, as they represented socially relevant stimuli, concerning <b>social</b> <b>phobics.</b> Subjective indicators of conditioned response were valence, arousal and awareness. The startle reflex (recorded from left m. orbicularis oculi) was used as a measure of subcortical emotional processing.

40|$|Social phobia is {{increasingly}} {{recognized as a}} prevalent and socially impairing mental disorder. However, little data is available regarding the general and disease-specific impairments and disabilities associated with social phobia. Furthermore, most studies have not controlled for the confounding effects of comorbid conditions. This study investigates: (a) the generic quality of life; (b) work productivity; and, (c) various other disorder-specific social impairments in current cases with pure (n = 65), comorbid (n = 51) and subthreshold (n = 34) DSM-IV social phobia as compared to controls with no social phobia (subjects {{with a history of}} herpes infections). Social phobia cases reported a mean illness duration of 22. 9 years with onset in childhood or adolescence. Current quality of life, as assessed by the SF- 36, was significantly reduced in all social phobia groups, particularly in the scales measuring vitality, general health, mental health, role limitations due to emotional health, and social functioning. Comorbid cases revealed more severe reductions than pure and subthreshold <b>social</b> <b>phobics.</b> Findings from the Liebowitz self-rated disability scale indicated that: (a) social phobia affects most areas of life, but in particular education, career, and romantic relationship; (b) the presence of past and current comorbid conditions increases the frequency and severity of disease-specific impairments; and, (c) subthreshold social phobia revealed slightly lower overall impairments than comorbid <b>social</b> <b>phobics.</b> Past-week work productivity of <b>social</b> <b>phobics</b> was significantly diminished as indicated by: (a) a three-fold higher rate of unemployed cases; (b) elevated rates of work hours missed due to social phobia problems; and (c) a reduced work performance. Overall, these findings underline that social phobia in our sample of adults, whether comorbid, subthreshold, or pure was a persisting and impairing condition, resulting in considerable subjective suffering and negative impact on work performance and social relationships. The current disabilities and impairments were usually less pronounced than in the past, presumably due to adaptive behaviors in life style of the respondents.

In separate analyses, AEQ scale scores were compared across group, level of alcohol consumption, gender, and social phobia subtype. ^ The relative order of the AEQ scales was found to be the same for both groups (i. e., Global Positive Changes (scale 1), Increased Social Assertiveness (scale 4), Physical and Social Pleasure (scale 3), Relaxation and Tension Reduction (scale 5), Arousal and Power (scale 6), and Enhanced Sexual Performance (scale 2)). Social anxiety was not found to be correlated with Increased Social Assertiveness (scale 4) for either anxious group, but was moderately correlated with this expectancy domain for the entire college sample. Analyses revealed that for the <b>social</b> <b>phobics,</b> the domain of Increased Social Assertiveness (scale 4) was best predicted by Global Positive Changes (scale 1), the Social Avoidance and Distress Scale (SADS), or quantity of alcohol consumption, whereas for the socially anxious college group, Increased Social Assertiveness (scale 4) was predicted by Relaxation and Tension Reduction (scale 5), Arousal and Power (scale 6), or degree of alcohol dependence. The <b>social</b> <b>phobics</b> 2 ̆ 7 alcohol expectancies were found to be significantly lower than those of the college sample. Several AEQ scales were found to be positively correlated with alcohol consumption. Finally, as predicted, there were no gender or social phobia subtype differences in strength of AEQ alcohol expectancies. ^ The limitations of the study are described and the results are discussed in terms of future research. ...|$|R
40|$|To examine memory bias {{for social}} threat in social phobics, four studies are {{reported}} in which <b>social</b> <b>phobic</b> and nonclinical Ss are compared on their retrieval of threat-relevant information. Study 1 measured standard recall and recognition of threat, neutral, and positive words, while Study 2 assessed retrieval of these words through implicit and explicit tasks. The two final studies attempted to increase {{the validity of the}} procedures. Study 3 examined recall of feedback in a hypothetical public performance task and Study 4 examined autobiographical memory for social and neutral situations. All four studies consistently failed to find any evidence for biased retrieval processes in social phobics...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of common factors in residential cognitive therapy (RCT) and residential interpersonal therapy (RIPT) for social phobia. Eighty <b>social</b> <b>phobic</b> patients were randomized to 10 weeks of RCT or RIPT. Patients and their individual therapists completed process and suboutcome measures weekly. The ratings were examined using linear mixed models. Most patient-rated process variables showed U-shaped (quadratic) patterns {{over the course of}} treatment. Therapist-rated alliance increased linearly. Therapist-rated first-week alliance and empathy predicted improvement in social role security over the course of therapy. The weekly fluctuations in common process predicted subsequent fluctuations in suboutcomes in seven of 10 possible cases, whereas suboutcomes predicted process in four cases. The results support the causal role of common factors...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} study we {{examined}} {{the psychometric properties of}} the Greek adaptation of the <b>Social</b> <b>Phobic</b> Inventory (SoPhI) (Moore & Gee, 2003). The questionnaire is a 21 -item self-report measure that assesses social anxiety based on the criteria of the DSM-IV-TR and DSM- 5. A total of 221 university students volunteered to complete the SoPhI. Exploratory Principal Components Analysis indicated the presence of a single factor explaining 38 % of the variance. The internal reliability was strong (· =. 92). These results provide evidence for the utility of this instrument to assess social anxiety in countries where Greek is spoken as well as for research involving cross-cultural comparisons. Future directions in research using this instrument are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim was {{to examine}} the neural corre-lates of anxiety {{elicited}} by the anticipation of public speaking in individuals with social phobia. Methods: Positron emission tomography and 15 O-water was used to measure regional cerebral blood flow in subjects with DSM-IV defined social phobia during anxi-ety anticipation. Heart rate and subjective anxiety were also recorded. While being scanned, subjects were speak-ing alone either before or after speaking in public. To evaluate anticipatory anxiety we compared individuals speaking alone before they were speaking {{in front of an audience}} with those who did the reverse. Results: Heart rate and subjective anxiety measures confirmed anticipatory anxiety in <b>social</b> <b>phobics</b> who performed their private speech before their public. This was accompanied by enhanced cerebral blood flow in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left inferior temporal cortex, and in the left amygdaloid-hippocampal region. Brain blood flow was lower in the left temporal pole and bilaterally in the cerebellum in the anticipation group. Conclusions: Brain regions with altered perfusion pre-sumably reflect changes in neural activity associated with worry about anticipated public performance. We speculate that anticipatory anxiety in <b>social</b> <b>phobics</b> originates in an affect sensitive fear network encompassing the amygdal-oid-hippocampal region, prefrontal, and temporal areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a new, comprehensive and multicomponent treatment for social phobia is described. Initial results of a pilot study with the new treatment also are reported. The treatment {{was found to be}} effective with severe (generalized) <b>social</b> <b>phobics,</b> most of whom had co-occurring Axis I and/or II conditions. In addition to significant change on a host of outcome variables, a normative-based endstate functioning index was used to determine treatment efficacy. The results are discussed with respect to the implementation of the treatment {{and in terms of the}} need for a comprehensive approach to treating social phobia...|$|R
5000|$|Humans {{generally}} require {{social acceptance}} and thus sometimes dread the disapproval of others. Apprehension of being judged by others may cause anxiety in social environments. Anxiety during social interactions, particularly between strangers, is common among young people. It may persist into adulthood and become social anxiety or social phobia. [...] "Stranger anxiety" [...] in small children {{is not considered}} a phobia. In adults, an excessive fear of other people is not a developmentally common stage; it is called social anxiety. According to Cutting, <b>social</b> <b>phobics</b> do not fear the crowd {{but the fact that}} they may be judged negatively.|$|R
