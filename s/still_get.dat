5|$|Beato, who {{had covered}} {{military}} operations in India and China, was probably attracted by {{the news of the}} annexation. While he arrived in Burma after the main military operations ended, he would <b>still</b> <b>get</b> {{to see more of the}} action, as the annexation by the British led to an insurgency which lasted for the following decade. This allowed Beato to take a number of pictures of British military in operations or at the Royal Palace, Mandalay, as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners.|$|E
5|$|In the 1903 Tour de France, the {{organisation}} guaranteed {{that the first}} 50 cyclists in the final general classification would earn at least 5 francs per day. In 1904, if not more than 50 cyclists would finish, also cyclists who dropped out during the race would <b>still</b> <b>get</b> 5 francs for the days {{they had been in}} the race. This rule was added to attract cyclists who otherwise would not enter, because the Tour needed enough competitors to remain credible.|$|E
5|$|The program used import {{subsidies}} to pump US {{dollars into the}} South Vietnamese treasury. The regimes sold these dollars to business people who held licenses to import American goods. The businessmen bought the US dollars from the Saigon treasury with their South Vietnamese piasters at half the official exchange rate; they then used this cheaply acquired American currency to import US goods. This meant that American manufacturers would <b>still</b> <b>get</b> {{the same amount of}} US currency they would have received for selling their goods on the free market, while South Vietnamese importers could get twice as much goods for the same money. The piasters that the Saigon government collected from selling the US aid dollars were to be placed in a fund held by the National Bank of Vietnam, which was to be used to fund the expansion and training of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, national police and civil service.|$|E

25|$|By early April 1884, {{the tribes}} north of Khartoum rose {{in support of}} the Mahdi, and cut the Egyptian traffic on the Nile and the {{telegraph}} to Cairo. Communications were not entirely cut, as runners could <b>still</b> <b>get</b> through, but the siege had begun and Khartoum could only rely on its own food stores, which could last five or six months.|$|E
25|$|Boxing Day is {{a holiday}} celebrated in Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and other Commonwealth countries. Boxing Day {{originated}} in England {{in the middle}} of the nineteenth century under Queen Victoria. For years in which the holiday falls on a weekend, the celebration is moved to make sure workers <b>still</b> <b>get</b> a day off (except in Canada, where it remains 26 Dec.) In the UK it is classed as a Bank Holiday.|$|E
25|$|Some Friends today {{regard the}} Peace Testimony in even a broader sense, refusing {{to pay the}} portion of the income tax that goes to fund the military. Yearly Meetings in the United States, Britain {{and other parts of the}} world endorse and support these Friends' actions. The Quaker Council for European Affairs campaigns in the European Parliament for the right of {{conscientious}} objectors in Europe not to be made to pay for the military. Some do pay the money into peace charities and <b>still</b> <b>get</b> goods seized by bailiffs or money taken from their bank accounts.|$|E

25|$|Gissendaner {{was convicted}} of {{orchestrating}} her husband's murder {{and sentenced to death}} in 1998 after Owen testified against her in a plea agreement in which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Owen told a jury that Gissendaner had first approached him about “a way to get rid of” her husband three months before the murder. He further testified that Gissendaner thought murder {{was the only way to}} get Douglas out of her life and <b>still</b> <b>get</b> the house and a payoff from his life insurance policy. During the trial, Gissendaner was discovered to have threatened witnesses and also plotted to pay a witness to commit perjury.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{numerous}} delays, 1,250 temporary seats weren't ready {{in time for}} the game. According to a police officer standing near the affected area, the seats hadn't been installed {{in time for the}} fire marshal to inspect them. The NFL scrambled almost until kickoff to find replacement seats. Eventually, 850 fans in four sections were relocated, while 400 fans in two sections were given a refund equivalent to three times the face value of their ticket. The latter set of fans were later offered the chance to watch the game on monitors in the North Field Club behind the Steelers bench, but would <b>still</b> <b>get</b> the triple refund. Some of these fans were still upset, since they had spent thousands on airfare and hotels. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said that when the league decided to relocate the 850 fans, it lost any shot of setting the attendance record.|$|E
25|$|In September 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{pushed to}} revive the stalled peace process by getting the parties involved to agree to direct talks {{for the first time}} in about two years. While U.S. President Barack Obama was the orchestrator of the movement, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went through months of cajoling just to get the parties to the table, and helped convince the reluctant Palestinians by getting support for direct talks from Egypt and Jordan. The aim of the talks was to forge the framework of a final agreement within one year, although general expectations of a success were fairly low. The talks aimed to put the Israeli–Palestinian conflict to an official end by forming a two-state solution for the Jewish and Palestinian peoples, promoting the idea of everlasting peace and putting an official halt to any further land claims, as well as accepting the rejection of any forceful retribution if violence should reoccur. Hamas and Hezbollah, however threatened violence, especially if either side seemed likely to compromise in order to reach an agreement. As a result, the Israeli government publicly stated that peace couldn't exist even if both sides signed the agreement, due to the stance taken by Hamas and Hezbollah. The US was therefore compelled to re-focus on eliminating the threat posed by the stance of Hamas and Hezbollah as part of the direct talk progress. Israel for its part, was skeptical that a final agreement was reached that the situation would change, as Hamas and Hezbollah would <b>still</b> <b>get</b> support to fuel new violence. In addition, the Israeli government rejected any possible agreement with Palestine as long as it refuses to recognize Israel as a Jewish state.|$|E

500|$|Bosley Crowther of The New York Times said: [...] "Don't miss it! This is to say, don't miss {{it if you}} can <b>still</b> <b>get</b> {{the least}} bit of fun out of lurid {{adventure}} fiction and pseudo-realistic fantasy. For this mad melodramatization of a desperate adventure of Bond with sinister characters in Istanbul and on the Orient Express is fictional exaggeration {{on a grand scale}} and in a dashing style, thoroughly illogical and improbable, but with tongue blithely wedged in cheek." ...|$|E
500|$|Connie Talbot's Christmas Album was {{difficult}} to obtain in Britain after the distributor, Pinnacle Entertainment, went into administration.

It's a shame, but they can <b>still</b> <b>get</b> the album in Asia and the US."

[...] In 1997, Jennifer Connelly said [...] "I <b>still</b> <b>get</b> recognized for Labyrinth by little girls in the weirdest places. I can't believe they still recognize me from that movie. It's on TV all the time and I guess I pretty much look the same." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Oberman has {{continuously}} {{affirmed that}} she loved playing Chrissie, and of all her roles misses playing her the most. In a 2009 interview she commented on {{the significance of the}} character to EastEnders and viewers, saying [...] "I can't believe that I'm still recognised so much as Chrissie. I <b>still</b> <b>get</b> a lot of letters about her, too. I think that she had as much of an impact as Janine (Charlie Brooks) did, which surprised me. Chrissie wasn't around for that long but she was an amazing character with an epic storyline." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing in {{his book}} The Encyclopedia of Superheroes on Film and Television, John Kenneth Muir said it was {{necessary}} for Cameron to set Dark Angel in the future because the prosperity of the U.S. in 2000 [...] "offered little possibility for crime, squalor and other societal problems". While criticizing certain plot elements in the second season as contributing to the show's downfall, Muir said that larger factors in the ratings drop were the September 11 attacks, the Enron scandal, and the depletion of the U.S. government's surplus, which changed Dark Angel's [...] "futuristic vision of recession in a Third-World America" [...] from an interesting, far-fetched premise to a [...] "depressing reminder that things could <b>still</b> <b>get</b> worse".|$|E
