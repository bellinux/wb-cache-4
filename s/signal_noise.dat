25|$|All {{ferroelectric}} materials exhibit piezoelectricity a piezoelectric effect. Because Class 2 ceramic capacitors use ferroelectric ceramics dielectric, {{these types}} of capacitors may have electrical effects called microphonics. Microphonics (microphony) describes how electronic components transform mechanical vibrations into an undesired electrical <b>signal</b> (<b>noise).</b> The dielectric may absorb mechanical forces from shock or vibration by changing thickness and changing the electrode separation, affecting the capacitance, which in turn induces an AC current. The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording.|$|E
25|$|In June 2001, NASA {{launched}} a second CMB space mission, WMAP, {{to make much}} more precise measurements of the large scale anisotropies over the full sky. WMAP used symmetric, rapid-multi-modulated scanning, rapid switching radiometers to minimize non-sky <b>signal</b> <b>noise.</b> The first results from this mission, disclosed in 2003, were detailed measurements of the angular power spectrum at a scale of less than one degree, tightly constraining various cosmological parameters. The results are broadly consistent with those expected from cosmic inflation as well as various other competing theories, and are available in detail at NASA's data bank for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) (see links below). Although WMAP provided very accurate measurements of the large scale angular fluctuations in the CMB (structures about as broad in the sky as the moon), {{it did not have}} the angular resolution to measure the smaller scale fluctuations which had been observed by former ground-based interferometers.|$|E

40|$|The {{main idea}} {{of this paper is}} to propose an innovative,benchmarking tool based on genetic {{algorithm}} to evaluate robustness of visible and invisible watermarking techniques.

However, when large quantities of data are to be assessed, subjective metrics such as mean opinion score(MOS),signal to <b>noise</b> ratio(SNR),peak <b>signal</b> to <b>noise</b> ratio(PSNR) are not pragmatic since it needs experts and inordinate amount of time. PSNR and WPSNR are independent of human visual system(HVS) parameters and hence they are inappropriate scales to measure potential research results. This brings out a new image fidelity metric called Enhanced Weighted peak <b>signal</b> to <b>noise</b> ratio(EWPSNR) which is experimentally proven to be better than PSNR and WPSNR...|$|R
