5|$|Some {{animals can}} {{navigate}} using celestial cues {{such as the}} position of the sun. Since the sun moves in the sky, navigation by this means also requires an internal clock. Many animals depend on such a clock to maintain their circadian rhythm. Animals that use <b>sun</b> <b>compass</b> orientation are fish, birds, sea-turtles, butterflies, bees, sandhoppers, reptiles, and ants.|$|E
5|$|Navigation {{is based}} on a variety of senses. Many birds have been shown to use a <b>sun</b> <b>compass.</b> Using the sun for {{direction}} involves the need for making compensation based on the time. Navigation has also been shown to be based on a combination of other abilities including the ability to detect magnetic fields (magnetoception), use visual landmarks as well as olfactory cues.|$|E

50|$|Navigation is {{important}} to Lepidoptera species, especially for those that migrate. Butterflies, which have more species that migrate, {{have been shown to}} navigate using time-compensated <b>sun</b> <b>compasses.</b> They can see polarized light, so can orient even in cloudy conditions. The polarized light in the region close to the ultraviolet spectrum is suggested to be particularly important. Most migratory butterflies are those that live in semiarid areas where breeding seasons are short. The life histories of their host plants also influence the strategies of the butterflies. Other theories include the use of landscapes. Lepidoptera may use coastal lines, mountains, and even roads to orient themselves. Above sea, the flight direction is much more accurate if the coast is still visible.|$|R

5|$|All trucks of the LRDG were {{equipped}} with the Bagnold <b>sun</b> <b>compass</b> and some trucks were also {{equipped with}} a P8 Tank Compass. Each patrol had a navigator who always rode in the second truck in the formation. He was equipped with a theodolite and astronomical position tables with which to plot star sightings, and maps. Watches were used and adjusted each evening using the GMT time check. One major problem faced early on by the LRDG {{was a lack of}} accurate maps for Libya in particular. Patrols had to do their own surveys and make their own maps of each route they took. In July 1941 the Survey Section was formed to carry out this task.|$|E
5|$|The LRDG {{vehicles}} were mainly two wheel drive, chosen {{because they were}} lighter and used less fuel than four wheel drive. They were stripped of all non-essentials, including doors, windscreens and roofs. They were fitted with a bigger radiator, a condenser system, built up leaf springs for the harsh terrain, wide, low pressure desert tyres, sand mats and channels, plus map containers and a <b>sun</b> <b>compass</b> devised by Bagnold. Wireless trucks had special compartments built into the bodywork to house wireless equipment. Initially the LRDG patrols were equipped with one Canadian Military Pattern (CMP) Ford 15 cwt F15 truck for the commander, {{while the rest of}} the patrol used up to 10 Chevrolet 30 cwt wide-body (WB) trucks. From March 1941 the 30 cwt Chevrolets were replaced by the CMP Ford 30 cwt F30, although in some ways this was a retrograde step; because they were four wheel drive and heavier than the Chevrolets, they used twice as much fuel, which in turn reduced the range of a patrol. From March 1942 the Fords were progressively replaced by 200 Canadian Chevrolet 1533 X2 30 cwts, which had been specially ordered for the LRDG. From July 1942 Willys Jeeps began to be issued for the patrol commander and patrol sergeant.|$|E

5000|$|Albert Hoit Bumstead was an American {{cartographer}} and inventor. He {{was born}} in Boston in 1875, and attended Worcester Academy for one year, graduating in 1894. His home {{at that time was}} Atlanta, Georgia. Albert went on to Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and studied civil engineering. After WPI, he was a surveyor for the U.S. Geological Survey. In 1910 he resided in Townsend Harbor, Massachusetts. In 1912, he was the topographer of the Yale University expedition to Peru, and by 1916 he was a cartographer at the National Geographic Society. Bumstead invented three <b>sun</b> <b>compasses</b> used by Admiral Richard Byrd and by the Navy aviators in the Arctic expedition led by Donald MacMillan. In addition, he developed a method for making marble bas-reliefs from photographs using a dual vision device, a prime with two reflecting surfaces. Albert died on January 9, 1940. Mount Bumstead in the Antarctic is named for him.|$|R

In the 1930s Mitford was one of several young army officers who started exploring the interior of the Libyan Desert.

25|$|A Hungarian team {{proposed}} that a <b>sun</b> <b>compass</b> artifact with crystals might have allowed Vikings {{to guide their}} boats at night too. A type of crystal they called a sunstone can use scattered sun light from below the horizon as a guide. What they suggest is that calcite stone crystals similar to one found amongst navigational tools on a sixteenth century sunken ship was used in combination with Haidinger's brush. If so, the Vikings could have used them in the northern latitudes where during the summer it never goes completely dark. In areas of confused magnetic deviation (such as the Labrador coast) a sunstone {{would have been a}} more reliable guide than a magnetic compass.|$|E
500|$|Antennae are {{the primary}} organs of {{olfaction}} (smell) in Lepidoptera. The antenna surface is covered {{with large numbers of}} olfactory scales, hairs or pits; as many as 1,370,000 are found on the antennae of a monarch. Antennae are extremely sensitive; the feathered antennae of male moths from the Saturniidae, Lasiocampidae and many other families are so sensitive that they can detect the pheromones of female moths from distances of up to [...] away. Lepidoptera antennae can be angled in many positions. They help the insect in locating the scent and can be considered to act as a kind of 'olfactory radar'. In moths, males frequently have antennae which are more feathery than those of the females, for detecting the female pheromones at a distance. Since females do not need to detect the males, they have simpler antennae. Antennae have also been found {{to play a role in}} the time-compensated <b>sun</b> <b>compass</b> orientation in migratory monarch butterflies.|$|E

2500|$|Byrd {{served on}} active duty during the First World War. He had the {{foresight}} to realize that aviation was going to expand rapidly in the next few years. [...] Byrd volunteered to become a naval aviator, took flying lessons and earned his pilot wings in August 1917. He developed a passion for flight, and pioneered many techniques for navigating airplanes over the open ocean including drift indicators, the <b>sun</b> <b>compass</b> and bubble sextants.|$|E
2500|$|Monarch {{butterflies}} {{are especially}} noted for their lengthy annual migration. In North America they make massive southward migrations starting in August {{until the first}} frost. A northward migration {{takes place in the}} spring. The monarch is the only butterfly that migrates both north and south as the birds do on a regular basis. But no single individual makes the entire round trip. Female monarchs deposit eggs for the next generation during these migrations. The length of these journeys exceeds the normal lifespan of most monarchs, which is less than two months for butterflies born in early summer. The last generation of the summer enters into a non-reproductive phase known as diapause and may live seven months or more. [...] During diapause, butterflies fly to one of many overwintering sites. The generation that overwinters generally does not reproduce until it leaves the overwintering site sometime in February and March. It is the second, third and fourth generations that return to their northern locations in the United States and Canada in the spring. How the species manages to return to the same overwintering spots over a gap of several generations is still a subject of research; the flight patterns appear to be inherited, based on a combination of the position of the sun in the sky and a time-compensated <b>Sun</b> <b>compass</b> that depends upon a circadian clock that is based in their antennae.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} clock shifts as an {{experimental}} tool for predictably {{interfering with the}} homing ability of birds is discussed. Clock shifts introduce specific errors in the birds' <b>sun</b> azimuth <b>compass,</b> resulting in corresponding errors during initial orientation and possibly during orientation enroute. The effects of 6 hour and 12 hour clock shifts resulted in a 90 degree deviation and a 180 degree deviation from the initial orientation, respectively. The method for conducting the clock shift experiments and results obtained from previous experiments are described...|$|R

5000|$|Reppert’s lab {{expanded}} upon Fred Urquhart's postulation that antennae {{play a role}} in monarch migration.
