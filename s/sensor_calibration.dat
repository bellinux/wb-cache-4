50|$|Spectral data {{acquired}} by satellite sensors {{are influenced by}} a number of factors, such as atmospheric absorption and scattering, sensor-target-illumination geometry, <b>sensor</b> <b>calibration,</b> and image data processing procedures, which tend to change through times (Teillet, 1986). Targets in multi-date scenes are extremely variable and have been nearly impossible to compare in an automated mode (Kim and Elman, 1990). In order to detect genuine landscape changes as revealed by changes in surface reflectance from multi-date satellite images, it is necessary to carry out radiometric correction. Two approaches to radiometric correction are possible: absolute and relative (Lo and Yang, 1998). The absolute approach requires the use of ground measurements at the time of data acquisition for atmospheric correction and <b>sensor</b> <b>calibration.</b> This is not only costly but also impractical when archival satellite image data are used for change analysis (Hall et al., 1991). The relative approach to radiometric correction, known as relative radiometric normalization (RRN), is preferred because no in-situ atmospheric data at the time of satellite overpasses are required. This method involves normalizing or rectifying the intensities or digital numbers (DN) of multi-date images band-by-band to a reference image selected by the analyst. The normalized images would appear as if they were acquired with the same sensor under similar atmospheric and illumination conditions to those of the reference image.|$|E

50|$|This p-wave to s-wave {{delay was}} put to test {{to see if it}} could be used to sense the real time {{position}} of a faulty wheel impact on a train on a track while moving at full speed. Test calculations has shown that the relative short distances of less than a few meters complicated the ability to clearly differentiated between the start of the p-wave and the subsequent arrival of the s-wave. Typical wheel impact pulse frequencies are below 2 kHz.The wave propagation delay time between the p-wave and s-wave over a distance of 1 meter is smaller than half the wavelength of the typical average frequency of the wheel impact impulse. This condition makes the method of measuring p-wave vs s-wave propagation delays virtually impossible since the s-wave will be superimposed on the p-wave before the ADC had the chance to even capture one full wavelength. Since seismic <b>sensor</b> <b>calibration</b> to KIPS are very critical it is important to capture at least a number of full wave cycles in order to establish whether the wheel exceeds allowed compression levels.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the usage of}} MADYMO simulations in improving frontal crash <b>sensor</b> <b>calibration.</b> MADYMO simulations were conducted in the frontal impact program to improve the <b>sensor</b> <b>calibration.</b> In developing the advanced frontal impact restraint system using dual stage inflator, <b>sensor</b> <b>calibration</b> is very important. Late firing of the first stage inflator and large time delay between first and second stage time-to-fires increased occupant injuries. In the early version of <b>sensor</b> <b>calibration,</b> the initially given TTF’s were not satisfied in some test speed conditions due to late first stage TTF and large time delay. Therefore, {{in order to determine}} the correct required TTF’s, MADYMO simulations were used. First, the dual stage inflator was modeled as having two stages, which are primary and secondary stages. Then, MADYMO simulations were conducted by giving time delay between first and second stages of inflator model. Through simulations, the required TTF’s were determined, which produced the injury values meeting the customer targets, and it was found that the relatively large time delay could be used in the low speeds. With the new required TTF’s and the relatively large time delay in low speeds, <b>sensor</b> <b>calibration</b> was repeated. The recalibration was found to satisfy the required TTF’s from the MADYMO simulations. A sled test was conducted in the worst-case condition and the injury results met the regulation limits...|$|E

The project encompassed <b>sensor</b> <b>calibrations,</b> system error minimization, sensor network design and deployment, and the characterization of temperatures in the Orphan Boy Mine shaft. Fiber-optic cable <b>sensor</b> <b>calibrations</b> yielded linear relationship coefficients 0. 6 - 1. 0 MHZ/°F, indicating a strong positive correlation between Brillouin Frequency Shifts and temperature. Calibrated sensors demonstrated accuracies near ± 0. 8 °F using the corrected error bounds from residual analyses as the benchmark. Fiber-optic measurement accuracy and repeatability were controlled by user-selected signal interrogator settings and design limitations within the system. Temperatures monitored during the February-July 2016 period showed little variation except when the Geothermal Heat Exchange System was in operation. A test of the geothermal system (used to heat the Natural Resources Building on the Montana Tech campus) was documented by the fiber-optic sensor cluster deployed in this project and separately by a temperature transducer from the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology.
