25|$|It {{may be more}} {{appropriate}} to use for e.g. folate, since approximately 90 percent of North Americans may actually suffer more or less from folate deficiency, but only the 2.5 percent that have the lowest levels will fall below the <b>standard</b> <b>reference</b> range. In this case, the actual folate ranges for optimal health are substantially higher than the <b>standard</b> <b>reference</b> ranges. Vitamin D has a similar tendency. In contrast, for e.g. uric acid, having a level not exceeding the <b>standard</b> <b>reference</b> range still does not exclude the risk of getting gout or kidney stones. Furthermore, for most toxins, the <b>standard</b> <b>reference</b> range is generally lower than the level of toxic effect.|$|R
5000|$|The rate {{at which}} the case of no {{abnormal}} condition still ends up in a measurement of serum calcium of being above the <b>standard</b> <b>reference</b> range (thereby classifying as hypercalcemia) is, by the definition of <b>standard</b> <b>reference</b> range, less than 2.5%. However, this probability can be further specified by considering how much the measurement deviates from the mean in the <b>standard</b> <b>reference</b> range. Let’s say that the serum calcium measurement was 1.30 mmol/L, which, with a <b>standard</b> <b>reference</b> range established at 1.05 to 1.25 mmol/L, corresponds to a standard score of 3 and a corresponding probability of 0.14% that such degree of hypercalcemia would have occurred in the first place in the case of no abnormality: ...|$|R
