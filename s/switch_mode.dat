For example, at full level, the player must manage research, negotiations, stocks, and shares. On sandbox, the game does not involve those aspects. The player can <b>switch</b> <b>mode</b> at any time. Game time is implemented like a calendar: {{at the end of}} each year, the player is judged on that year's performance against rivals. Game speed can be adjusted, and staff can be moved by the player. Cash awards may be earned for doing well, and trophies may be awarded for achievements such as having the longest roller coaster.|$|E

The magnetically soft YFe 2 compound {{acts as a}} separator between the hard rare earth (RE) ErFe 2 and DyFe 2 compounds, each of them bearing different temperature dependent magnetic anisotropy properties. Magnetic measurements of a system with n = 20 nm reveal the existence of three switching modes: an independent <b>switching</b> <b>mode</b> at low temperatures, an ErFe 2 spin flop <b>switching</b> <b>mode</b> at medium high temperatures, and an YFe 2 dominated <b>switching</b> <b>mode</b> at high temperatures. The measurements are in qualitative agreement {{with the findings of}} micromagnetic simulations which are used to illustrate the <b>switching</b> <b>modes.</b> Further simulations for a varied YFe 2 layer thickness n ranging from 2 to 40 nm are carried out. Quantitative criteria are defined to classify the reversal behavior, and the resultant <b>switching</b> <b>modes</b> are laid out in a map with regard to n and the temperature T. A new coupled <b>switching</b> <b>mode</b> emerges above a threshold temperature for samples with thin YFe 2 separation layers {{as a consequence of the}} exchange coupling between the magnetically hard ErFe 2 and DyFe 2 layers. It reflects the increasing competition of the two conflicting anisotropies to dominate the magnetic switching states of both RE compounds under decreasing n. © 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of miniaturised excitation circuitry in portable systems and transducer integrated front ends is challenging {{due to the}} requirements for high voltage and high current generation. Arbitrary excitation performed using digital to analog converters and high specification amplifiers cannot be easily miniaturised. Switched excitation circuitry can easily miniaturised but requires careful waveform design to achieve arbitrary excitation. Previously, Harmonic Reduction Pulse Width Modulation (HRPWM) has been proposed to allow the design of low harmonic content <b>switched</b> <b>mode</b> excitation signals through a parameterized design process. This paper proposes the technique arbitrary-HRPWM (AHRPWM) to allow the synthesis of three and five level true arbitrary <b>switched</b> <b>mode</b> excitation waveforms.

The circuit {{of this system}} {{was similar to the}} Winterburn patent in that it used a push-pull converted <b>switch</b> <b>mode</b> oscillator for energy transfer to a store - discharge capacitor and conventional contact breakers to initiate a thyristor triggering discharge of the charged CD capacitor. It was stated to offer several advantages over conventional ignition. Among which: better combustion, easy starting even under subzero conditions, immunity to contactor (points) bounce and 2% - 5% fuel economy. Subsequent letters to Wireless World ( [...] March & May 1970), with Mr. Marston’s replies, further discussed aspects of the design and build. In July 1971 Mr. A.P. Harris, undergraduate of the City University London made a detailed electrical engineering analysis of the Marston design as well as automotive engine measurement trials to verify fuel economy. These confirmed the benefits of the CD ignition system.
