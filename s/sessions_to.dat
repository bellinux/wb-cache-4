5|$|Government {{meetings}} are public; however, {{the government may}} decide to close any part of its sessions (or entire <b>sessions)</b> <b>to</b> the public. The prime minister may authorise any deputy to represent the PM and otherwise take over any particular task assigned to the PM. The quorum for government sessions is a majority of government members. Most decisions are reached by a simple majority vote; a two-thirds majority vote is required for decisions about changes to the Croatian Constitution, uniting with other states or transferring any part of Croatian sovereignty to supranational organisations, changes to Croatian borders, dissolution of the parliament, or calling a referendum.|$|E
5|$|Originally, MTV {{planned to}} air the show {{several times during}} April 1992, it was normal for MTV Unplugged <b>sessions</b> <b>to</b> air around six times {{during the month of}} release, before being archived. Carey's version was met with {{critical}} acclaim and extended popularity, leading to it being shown more often than usual. Fans from around the United States made multiple requests for the show to be aired on television, {{and by the end of}} April 1992, Carey's episode of MTV Unplugged had aired over three-times as much as an average episode would. The concert's success tempted Sony officials to use it as some form of an album. However, Carey and Afansieff were already making headway on a new album set tentatively for release in 1993. This being so, Sony decided to release it as an EP, selling for a reduced price due to its shorter length.|$|E
5|$|Public {{occasions}} {{were treated}} with mistrust and from the later seventeenth century there were efforts by kirk <b>sessions</b> <b>to</b> stamp out activities such as well-dressing, bonfires, guising, penny weddings and dancing. The Reformation had a severe impact on church music. The Lutheranism that influenced the early Scottish Reformation attempted to accommodate Catholic musical traditions into worship, drawing on Latin hymns and vernacular songs. The most important product of this tradition in Scotland was The Gude and Godlie Ballatis, which were spiritual satires on popular ballads composed by the brothers James, John and Robert Wedderburn. Never adopted by the kirk, they nevertheless remained popular and were reprinted from the 1540s to the 1620s. Later the Calvinism that came to dominate was much more hostile to Catholic musical tradition and popular music, placing {{an emphasis on the}} Psalms. The Scottish Psalter of 1564 was commissioned by the Assembly of the Church. Whole congregations would now all sing these psalms, often using common tunes, unlike the trained choirs who had sung the many parts of polyphonic hymns.|$|E

5|$|Recording {{started in}} December 1971 at Morgan Studios, London. Unlike {{previous}} albums, where Anderson had generally written songs in advance, only the initial {{section of the}} album had been worked out when the band went into the studio. The remainder of the suite was written during the recording <b>sessions.</b> <b>To</b> compensate {{for a lack of}} material, Anderson got up early each morning to prepare music {{for the rest of the}} band to learn during that day's session. The lyrics were written first, with the music constructed to fit around them. Anderson recalls the album took about two weeks to record and another two or three for overdubs and mixing. The final work spanned the entire length of an LP record, split over two sides.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes {{played for}} Gala Cricket Club in 1896 and 1897, as an all-rounder {{who opened the}} batting and bowled medium paced seamers. He took 92 wickets in his first season, and {{discovered}} that bowling an occasional slow ball brought him some success. He decided to change his bowling style to spin, and spent the winter of 1896–97 practising on the family farm while also working again on the railway, this time as a signalman. Over several months, Rhodes used his practice <b>sessions</b> <b>to</b> develop control of spin and different types of delivery. Consequently, {{in his second season}} at Galashiels, now bowling slow left-arm, he took fewer wickets but at a better average. At the end of the 1897 season, encouraged by a Scottish member of the MCC, he resigned from Gala to look for work in England.|$|E

She also admitted to throwing a fit in the middle of a rehearsal when she received news that her grandfather was dying, and demanded that she be allowed to leave.|$|E

5|$|The {{membership}} of the Standing Committee consists of the chairman, deputy chairmen and other members; these members are elected by the National Assembly. Standing Committee members cannot simultaneously be members of the Government. Members work on a full-time basis, and their terms of office correspond with the term of the National Assembly. The Standing Committee continues to function until a new National Assembly is elected. According to the constitution, the Standing Committee is responsible for 12 duties. Of these, the most important are the powers to announce, convene and chair the National Assembly <b>sessions,</b> <b>to</b> interpret the constitution, laws and ordinances, and to issue ordinances on those matters assigned by the National Assembly. It supervises and guides the People's Councils and their activities, and directs, regulates and coordinates {{the activities of the}} Ethnic Council and the committees of the National Assembly.|$|E
5|$|When Brion sent a {{bill for}} the {{abandoned}} <b>sessions</b> <b>to</b> DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. The singer complained of intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the Figure 8 album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith {{sent a message to}} the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell of Goldenboy. McConnell told Spin that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1,500 worth of heroin and crack per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips and Scott McPherson of Sense Field played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass guitar and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.|$|E
5|$|While there, Lennon was {{inspired}} to embark on two recording projects: to make an album of the old rock 'n' roll songs that inspired {{him to become a}} musician, and to produce another artist. In December 1973, Lennon collaborated with Phil Spector to record the oldies album, Rock 'n' Roll. The alcohol-fueled recording sessions became legendary. Every musician in L.A. wanted to participate, but soon Lennon's drinking and Spector's erratic behavior (which included his firing a gun in the studio control room) caused the <b>sessions</b> <b>to</b> break down. Then Spector, who claimed to have been in a car accident, took the sessions tapes and was unreachable.|$|E

5|$|Wilco began touring {{in support}} of Ghost even before the album had been released. Multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach left the band after the {{recording}} <b>sessions</b> <b>to</b> join a theater production, so Wilco added jazz rock guitarist Nels Cline and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone to replace him. Sansone had been playing with The Autumn Defense, a side project led by bassist John Stirratt. However, the tour to support the album had to be abridged. In May 2004, Tweedy checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic in Chicago, Illinois due to chronic migraine headaches, anxiety attacks, and clinical depression. In the process of treating the ailments, Tweedy became addicted to prescription painkillers. His rehab led to the cancellation of the European stage of the tour and a delay in the album's release date. Intended for release on June 8, 2004, the album was officially released on June 22, 2004.|$|E
5|$|As {{temperatures}} cooled in {{the final}} qualifying session, {{over a third of}} the field improved their fastest laps, but Jani's pole position time was unchallenged. Audi No. 7 led the session with a three minutes and 20.967 seconds lap time, still over four seconds shy of pole position. Nissan improved all three of their cars during the session, closing to within a second of the closest LMP1 competitor. The No. 26 G-Drive Ligier-Nissan closed to within a second of KCMG to take the second grid position in LMP2, while Greaves remained in third. In LMGTE Pro the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari rebounded from the loss of their qualifying times in the first session to lead the final session and come within a tenth of a second of Aston Martin. The sister AF Corse Ferrari also improved to fourth in the category to split the top of the grid in the class amongst the two manufacturers. The lead in LMGTE Am remained with the No. 98 Aston Martin, a second and a half ahead of the No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari. SMP Racing improved their time by leading both of the day's qualifying <b>sessions</b> <b>to</b> take second place on the grid, splitting the Aston Martin cars. The No. 67 AAI Porsche suffered a fire during the session which halted qualifying for nearly half an hour.|$|E
5|$|At {{an early}} stage, CART {{encountered}} problems {{in promoting the}} race. They were unable to adequately educate British motor racing fans about the series. Rockingham's owners attempted to display an advertisement at the 2001 British Grand Prix but the owner of Formula One's commercial rights Bernie Ecclestone cancelled the plan shortly before {{it was due to}} occur. A major marketing strategy took place in response. The advertising, headed by the Michaelides & Bednash agency, began in August in the printed press, and also included two television advertisements and an official poster. The event was affected by drainage problems on the new track which caused the practice <b>sessions</b> <b>to</b> be cancelled. The starting order was set according to the drivers' positions in the points' standings. Its distance was reduced from 210 to 140 laps and was won by Team Penske driver Gil de Ferran after overtaking pole position starter Kenny Bräck on the race's final lap. Most drivers praised the circuit but did not criticise the problem that affected it. Despite two days of practice and qualifying rounds being cancelled because of the drainage issues, 38,000 spectators watched the race. The track later had an extra layer added along with a sealant to allow it to drain water.|$|E
