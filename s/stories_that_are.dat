25|$|This {{approach}} {{has been an important}} influence on the short story in Ireland. Recently Jack Hart declared in the preface to his collection From Under Gogol's Nose (2004) that the parameters of the short story had been set too narrowly. He advocates a broader range of possibilities, from <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> almost essays to those that are almost poems. He argues that the short story should be seen as closer by nature to the poem, requiring a similar engagement from the reader and communicating in a similar way through a fundamentally oral/aural process.|$|E

Foundation and partial story weaknesses are easily remediated in most cases, but this is only effective if the work is competently done, with proper attention to minor details such as nailing patterns and proper connections. Local surveys of recently completed work have exposed deficient workmanship in a number of cases involving household retrofits.|$|E
25|$|Chitrakatha Guchchamu is a {{collection}} of eight <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> full of wit and morality. Chilakamarti recorded common stories related to humour, morals, real life incidents etc popular among Telugu people into two volumes under the title Vinodamulu (which literally means humour). In the second part, he included some poems too. Navvula Gani (which literally means laughing mine) is yet another humorous creation of Chilakamarti that comes in two parts. It mainly consisted of fun tit bits in various forms and it became very popular in those days. He introduced a feature called Hasya Latalu (creepers of humour) in the magazines run by him which was well received and enjoyed by large numbers of readers. Quite possibly, those Hasya Latalu were like the current day tit bits, cartoons and jokes published in the popular weeklies and dailies.|$|E

500|$|Film noir {{is often}} {{described}} as essentially pessimistic. The noir <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> regarded as most characteristic tell of people trapped in unwanted situations (which, in general, they did not cause but are responsible for exacerbating), striving against random, uncaring fate, and frequently doomed. The films are seen as depicting a world that is inherently corrupt. Classic film noir has been associated by many critics with the American social landscape of the era—in particular, with a sense of heightened anxiety and alienation that is said to have followed World War II. In author Nicholas Christopher's opinion, [...] "it is as if the war, and the social eruptions in its aftermath, unleashed demons that had been bottled up in the national psyche." [...] Film noirs, especially those of the 1950s and the height of the Red Scare, are often said to reflect cultural paranoia; Kiss Me Deadly is the noir most frequently marshaled as evidence for this claim.|$|E

It demonstrates that while some films, particularly those in the Hollywood tradition that combines [...] "realism and melodramatic romanticism", are intended as a form of escapism, others require a deeper engagement or more thoughtful response from their audiences. For example, the award winning Senegalese film Xala takes government corruption as its theme. Charlie Chaplin's film The Great Dictator was a brave and innovative parody, also on a political theme. <b>Stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> thousands of years old, such as Noah, have been re-interpreted in film, applying familiar literary devices such as allegory and personification with new techniques such as CGI to explore big themes such as [...] "human folly", good and evil, courage and despair, love, faith, and death themes that have been a main-stay of entertainment across all its forms.|$|E

As it typical of the style, the second floor is more elaborate with a shallow balcony of iron supported by iron brackets and the paneling of the upper facade's surmounting entablature is elaborately decorative. The sides and rear are similar to the front facade, but include blind recesses and the molding is of a browner sandstone.|$|E

The editors provide a one-paragraph summary for each story and a link to an external website where the story originated. Each story becomes the topic for a threaded discussion among the site's users.

Every comment is initially given a score of −1 to +2, with a default score of +1 for registered users, 0 for anonymous users (Anonymous Coward), +2 for users with high [...] "karma", or 1 for users with low [...] "karma". As moderators read comments attached to articles, they click to moderate the comment, either up (+1) or down (1).
