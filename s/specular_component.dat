It is usually used for high speed rendering where more advanced shading techniques are too computationally expensive. As a result of flat shading all of the polygon's vertices are colored with one color, allowing differentiation between adjacent polygons. Specular highlights are rendered poorly with flat shading: If there happens to be a large <b>specular</b> <b>component</b> at the representative vertex, that brightness is drawn uniformly over the entire face.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} specular {{coherent and}} noncoherent optimal detection for unresolved multipath Ricean fading channels with known delays. The {{focus is on}} receiver structures and performance. Specular coherent detection employs the carrier phase of the Ricean <b>specular</b> <b>component,</b> while noncoherent detection does not. Therefore, a specular coherent detector must be augmented with a carrier phase estimator for the <b>specular</b> <b>component.</b> The structures considered in this paper are generalization of the well-known Rake receiver to the unresolved multipath case. It is shown that both optimal structures perform a decorrelation operation before combining, which is essential to eliminating error floors under multipath unresolvability conditions. Furthermore, the noncoherent optimal receiver includes an inherent estimator for the <b>specular</b> <b>component</b> phasor. It is shown that the specular coherent and noncoherent structures converge at high SNR. This result is confirmed through analytical and numerical performance evaluation. Little performance gains {{can be obtained by}} the use of specular coherent detection for orthogonal frequency-shift keying {{and to a lesser extent}} for differential phase-shift keying over mixed mode Ricean/Rayleigh fading channels, making noncoherent demodulation attractive in these cases.

Photometric Stereo (PS) is broadly considered a suitable approach for high-resolution shape recovery, but its functionality is restricted to a limited set of object surfaces and controlled lighting setup. In particular, PS models generally consider reflection from objects as purely diffuse, with specularities being regarded as a nuisance that breaks down shape reconstruction.

30|$|Multi-user {{beamforming}} and precoding {{approaches are}} in general {{very sensitive to}} CSI imperfections at the transmitter. Most existing approaches are not efficiently applicable in high-mobility situations, since channel matrices change so quickly over time that already small processing delays can lead to substantial inter-user interference. In this paper, we provide a remedy to this problem by considering non-coherent beamforming/precoding in the angular domain with robustness w.r.t. angular uncertainty. In addition to improving the robustness of the beamformer/precoder, this has the further advantage that only a minimal amount of CSIT is required, namely the angles of departure {{of the most significant}} <b>specular</b> <b>components</b> together with their respective gains as obtained from a low-rank basis decomposition. We show that the relevant CSI can efficiently be quantized by applying a variant of the OMP algorithm. Naturally, under ideal circumstances of perfect CSIT, such a non-coherent approach cannot compete with coherent methods in terms of the achievable multiplexing gain. Also, it is not well suited for strong scattering environments with a large number of significant <b>specular</b> <b>components</b> because the low-rank channel decomposition has a large residual error in such cases. Nevertheless, the proposed technique can provide substantial improvements in situations with few dominant <b>specular</b> <b>components,</b> as for example expected in the millimeter wave regime, and it enables robust multi-user beamforming/precoding with low requirements on CSIT accuracy.|$|R

PCS can be provided by wireless cellular communication systems, that operate in radio environments characterized as multipath fading channels. This thesis addresses the subject of signal detection and performance analysis over multipath Ricean/Rayleigh fading channels, when the multipath delays are known and the path resolvability assumption is not satisfied. The path resolvability condition asserts that the signal autocorrelation function vanishes ("strict") or it is small ("approximate") at inter-path delays. The strict path resolvability assumption is rarely satisfied, and even the approximate path resolvability condition is not always satisfied in practice. For example, the approximate path resolvability is not satisfied for narrow-band systems such as GSM, IS 136, or their third generation derivatives and it is neither satisfied for wide-band systems, such as IS 95 or W-CDMA, in indoors due to the relatively small multipath delays of these environments. Existing demodulation schemes for multipath fading channels, such as Rake receivers, provide diversity gains but they are based on the path resolvability assumption. This thesis shows the severe limitations of the classical Rake receiver over unresolved multipath fading channels, and generalizes the Rake concept to improve performance. The optimal receiver that assumes knowledge of the <b>specular</b> <b>component</b> (specular coherent), and the optimal scheme that assumes knowledge of the <b>specular</b> <b>component</b> magnitudes only (non-coherent), are derived for unresolved Ricean multipath fading channels.

This thesis presents explicit forms of the Minimum Mean-Square Error estimator of the likelihood ratio estimator-correlator forms, and shows that the decorrelation operation is present in the estimation process. Based on the insight provided by these optimal schemes, suboptimal receivers more suitable for implementation are proposed. Performance analysis results, for several binary modulation formats, demonstrate the importance of the decorrelation operation in yielding diversity gains and eliminating error floors under multipath unresolvability conditions.
