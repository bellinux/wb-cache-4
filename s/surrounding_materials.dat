2500|$|An {{assembly}} {{that supports}} a sustained nuclear chain reaction {{is called a}} critical assembly or, if the assembly is almost entirely made of a nuclear fuel, a critical mass. The word [...] "critical" [...] refers to a cusp {{in the behavior of}} the differential equation that governs the number of free neutrons present in the fuel: if less than a critical mass is present, then the amount of neutrons is determined by radioactive decay, but if a critical mass or more is present, then the amount of neutrons is controlled instead by the physics of the chain reaction. The actual mass of a critical mass of nuclear fuel depends strongly on the geometry and <b>surrounding</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Poetry {{in essence}} is as {{familiar}} to barbarous as to civilized nations. The Laplander and the savage Indian are cheered by {{it as well}} as the inhabitants of London and Paris;--its spirit takes up and incorporates <b>surrounding</b> <b>materials,</b> as a plant clothes itself with soil and climate, whilst it exhibits the working of a vital principle within independent of all accidental circumstances. And to judge with fairness of an author's works, we ought to distinguish what is inward and essential from what is outward and circumstantial. It is essential to poetry that it be [...] "simple" [...] and appeal to the elements and primary laws of our nature; that it be [...] "sensuous" [...] and by its imagery elicit truth at a flash; that it be [...] "impassioned," [...] and be able to move our feelings and awaken our affections. In comparing different poets with each other, we should inquire which have brought into the fullest play our imagination and our reason, or have created the greatest excitement and produced the completest harmony. If we consider great exquisiteness of language and sweetness of metre alone, it is impossible to deny to Pope the character of a delightful writer; but whether he be a poet, must depend upon our definition of the word; and, doubtless, if every thing that pleases be poetry, Pope's satires and epistles must be poetry. This, I must say, that poetry, as distinguished from other modes of composition, does not rest in metre, and that it is not poetry, if it make no appeal to our passions or our imagination. One character belongs to all true poets, that they write from a principle within, not originating in any thing without; and that the true poet's work in its form, its shapings, and its modifications, is distinguished from all other works that assume to belong to the class of poetry, as a natural from an artificial flower, or as the mimic garden of a child from an enamelled meadow. In the former the flowers are broken from their stems and stuck into the ground; they are beautiful to the eye and fragrant to the sense, but their colours soon fade, and their odour is transient as the smile of the planter;--while the meadow may be visited again and again with renewed delight, its beauty is innate in the soil, and its bloom is of the freshness of nature.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} thermal-mechanical model for {{describing}} {{the formation of}} shear zones. We consider shear deformation of a two-dimensional rectangular region composed of a viscous fluid under a constant velocity at the boundary. Viscosity of the material is assumed to depend only on temperature for simplicity. In order to enhance the shear deformation, we included a small inclusion whose viscosity {{differs from that of}} the <b>surrounding</b> <b>material.</b> We carried out time-marching simulations and monitored the evolution of temperature and strain around the inclusion. Our results show that the deformation localizes in a narrow region when sufficient heat is generated by viscous dissipation. In the zone of localized deformation, temperature increases by several hundred degrees owing to strong dissipative heating. We found that the zone of localized deformation develops in the region where the greatest heat is generated at the initial stage of evolution. The zone of localized deformation pierces the inclusion when the inclusion is weaker than the <b>surrounding</b> <b>material,</b> while it develops away from the inclusion when the inclusion is stiffer than the <b>surrounding</b> <b>material.</b> These findings, though qualitatively, suggest that heating by viscous dissipation may {{play an important role in}} the formation of decollements around subducted seamounts...|$|R
