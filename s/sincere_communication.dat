The unit had been in development for 8 months prior to being scrapped. Titled the Counter-Disinformation Team, {{it would have been a}} reboot of the Active Measures Working Group set up by the Reagan Administration. It was created under the Bureau of International Information Programs. Work began in 2014, with the intention of countering propaganda from Russian sources such as TV network RT (formerly called Russia Today). A beta website was ready, and staff were hired by the U.S. State Department for the unit prior to its cancellation. U.S. Intelligence officials explained to former National Security Agency analyst and counterintelligence officer John R. Schindler that the Obama Administration decided to cancel the unit, as they were afraid of antagonizing Russia. A State Department representative told the International Business Times after being contacted regarding the closure of the unit, that the U.S. was disturbed by propaganda from Russia, and the strongest defense was <b>sincere</b> <b>communication.</b> U.S. Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy Richard Stengel was the point person for the unit before it was canceled. Stengel had written in 2014 that RT was engaged in a disinformation campaign about Ukraine.|$|E

By replicating the methodology of Patelli and Pedrini (J Bus Ethics 124 : 19 – 34, 2014) we contrast impression management theory with communicative action theory, and conduct text analysis of shareholder letters through the linguistic software program DICTION. Furthermore, we extend Patelli and Pedrini’s (J Bus Ethics 124 : 19 – 34, 2014) study by capturing and comparing two different macroeconomic contexts in a large sample of publicly listed U. S. banks. In contrast to Patelli and Pedrini (J Bus Ethics 124 : 19 – 34, 2014), who found support for <b>sincere</b> <b>communication</b> by Fortune 500 firms in {{the outbreak of the}} global financial crisis, we find that optimistic tone was not positively associated with future financial performance neither prior to nor in the outbreak of the financial crisis. Thus with our results, we contribute to the academic field of impression management. Moreover, our study is of value to academics and other users of shareholder letters, which should question the sincerity of information communicated. However, as our study is limited to banks that survived the financial crisis, consideration of the survival bias should be taken. If accessibility of bankrupt banks’ annual reports is improved, a suggestion for further research could be to include these to test whether our results are supported. MSc in Accountin...|$|E

40|$|By en {{engaging}} in socio sponsorships, companies {{can not only}} generate favorable consumer attitudes and enhance purchase intention, but {{in a long term}} perspective, they can build company image and strong stakeholder relationships. However, consumers’ low awareness of and critical attributions towards the sponsorship activity still remain impediment in companies’ attempt to benefit from the sponsorship, emphasizing a need for companies to communicate sponsorship more effectively to consumers. In order to fill a gap in sponsorship literature, this thesis examines how the choice of message channel might enhance trust and purchase intentions for low and high reputation sponsors in socio sponsorship, and whether the effects are mediated by persuasion knowledge, sincerity and fit. The findings indicated that low reputation companies are better off communicating with advertisement, whilst high reputation companies proved to create more favorable consumer outcomes with PR. Socio sponsors want to balance commercial and altruistic motives because the support of a good cause might trigger skepticism make extrinsic motives more salient. As low reputation companies are perceived as less <b>sincere,</b> <b>communication</b> through third party sources might create a contrast effect that increases suspicion and perception of dishonest intentions. As such, low reputation companies are better off communicating through advertisement that is more transparent and direct in its form. Sponsors with a high brand reputation, however, will generate higher consumer outcomes by using third party communication. Consequently, sponsors ought to communicate through PR, historically known for generating sponsor trust and credibility (e. g. Ries & Ries; Yoon et al 2006). Moreover the study showed that a high reputation will {{have a positive effect on}} consumer’s perception of sponsorship congruency. The findings are similar to what Roy & Cornwell (2004) found in their study on event sponsorships...|$|E

50|$|Although silent {{understanding}} is generally {{recognized as a}} universal human phenomenon, the term ishin-denshin {{is often used to}} convey a style of nonverbal communication between two people that is felt by some Japanese to be characteristic of Japanese culture. Whereas the Japanese concept of haragei denotes a deliberate form of nonverbal communication, ishin-denshin refers to a passive form of shared understanding. Ishin-denshin is traditionally perceived by the Japanese as <b>sincere,</b> silent <b>communication</b> via the heart or belly (i.e. symbolically from the inside, uchi), as distinct from overt communication via the face and mouth (the outside, soto), which is seen as being more susceptible to insincerities. The introduction of this concept to Japan (via China) is related to the traditions of Zen Buddhism, where the term ishin-denshin refers to direct mind transmission. Zen Buddhism tradition, in turn, draws the concept of ishin-denshin from the first Dharma transmission between Gautama Buddha and Mahākāśyapa in the Flower Sermon.|$|R

From a learning perspective, however, {{it is difficult to}} access meaningful on-site information within a given context. The Hypercontextualized Game (HCG) design model interweaves on-site resources, translated as content, and the digital game. As a local game design process, HCG builds on the resources available on-site (context) and transfers them beyond their origin (hyper). A successful example is the HCG stories in LieksaMyst, an application developed for the Pielinen Museum, in which the player is guided through a series of activities by a virtual host from the historic past. It took three years of extensive work and research for the LieksaMyst HCG stories to mature from brainstorming concepts to a fully-fledged museum service. Curators, educational technology experts and a total of 476 visitors (from 6 to 77 years old) contributed to the design process. The analysis of the context and feedback from the visitors enabled us to choose media, content and activities suitable to the Pielinen Museum. Our findings indicate that quality time, <b>sincere</b> reflection and <b>communication</b> between local experts and potential players, are indispensable when designing a HCG based game. The analysis benefits researchers and practitioners who are interested in the ways in which a game can bridge the gap between people and relevant on-site information...|$|R
40|$|The {{cooperation}} of the kindergarten with parents {{is not an easy}} task, but it is valuable for parents and pedagogues as well. It must always go with the level of interacting support and enrichment in the direction of successful development of the child. The most important here are warm human relation, <b>sincere</b> <b>communication</b> and qualification; it is certainly necessary to work on it all the time. On the theoretical level I represented the child attached between his family and the kindergarten. I continued with the importance of cooperation between the kindergarten and parents. I also exposed principles, methods and forms of cooperation with parents, interpersonal relation and communication. The final part of the theoretical work was meant for the presentation of Maria Montessori, its pedagogics and especially its cooperation with parents. I also represented the kindergarten of Angela and its forms of work where parents are included in its life and work. My intention of the research was to find out the obstacles of cooperation, expectations of parents and pedagogues, forms of work offered by the kindergarten, responses of parents, what importance the cooperation has for the included and in what way this cooperation is successful. I found the data with the help of three interviewed parents and pedagogues (two pedagogues and the head-mistress). The gained findings offer new opportunities for the progress and development of the cooperation with parents. In the opinion of all interviewed persons the cooperation has a very big importance. They believe that the cooperation is successful because they all make an effort for open communication and good personal relations. For successful cooperation confidence is essential and without fail it must be established {{at the beginning of the}} initiation of children in the kindergarten. They face with numerous obstacles, from different expectations, lack of time and discordance between education at home and kindergarten.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} volunteer tourism phenomenon {{and the role}} of authenticity in volunteer tourists' experiences. Although previous research has explored volunteer tourism, this study examines the phenomenon using in-depth interviews of volunteer tourists who have done different types of volunteer tourism trips. This study investigates the types of opportunities in which these volunteer tourists have participated, why they have participated in volunteer tourism, and what they have gained from their volunteer tourism experiences. The study's results illustrate numerous opportunities to travel almost anywhere in the world, including developed countries, and that teaching and construction were common volunteer activities. A typical volunteer tourism trip for these participants lasted two weeks with the volunteering portion lasting a month or less, and all participants took part in touring the local area in some way. The study explores the motives of these volunteer tourists and found that most participants went on their trip to have a new experience of {{a different part of the}} world or to help others. Previous researchers stress that the overlying motive of volunteer tourists is altruism; however, this study finds that the 'desire for a new experience' outweighs 'altruistic' motives. The difference in these findings illustrates how volunteer tourists' motives can vary and that some volunteer tourists may be more vacation-minded than volunteer-minded. These volunteer tourists' attained experiences reveal three main themes: experiences relating to self; getting behind-the-scenes; and <b>sincere</b> <b>communication</b> and relationships. Based on these attained experiences, the study explores the role of authenticity in them and found that existential authenticity (inter-personal and intra-personal), constructive authenticity, staged authenticity, sincerity, and intimacy all play a role. Some participants learnt more about their self and had life-changing experiences, which made them gain a better or different sense of their self or discover their identity. These experiences relate to existential authenticity. The sense of satisfaction attained by many of these participants shows signs of intra-personal authenticity. The study also demonstrates the role of staged authenticity with behind-the-scenes experiences important to these volunteer tourists. Ideas of constructive authenticity relate to when some of the participants experienced the host destination differently from their beliefs and expectations. Lastly, notions of sincerity and intimacy, linked to notions of interpersonal authenticity, are significant in the context of volunteer tourists' genuine communication and relationship forming with members of the local community and fellow volunteers. Based on these results, this study concludes that authenticity plays an important role in volunteer tourists' experiences and that this helps differentiate volunteer tourism from other tourism experiences...|$|E
40|$|How should judges {{interpret}} statutes? Like many others, {{we begin}} with the premise that statutory interpretation is a quest by judges to use the best available theory and information to determine “what statutes mean. ” When seen in this light, two attributes of statutes merit attention. · Statutes are a form of communication. · Statutes contain a constitutionally-privileged command of the form “If you are in situation X, then you must do Y. ” In other words, statutes are manufactured by a constitutionally authorized legislative body and are directed towards those who are constitutionally-obligated to implement, enforce, or follow the law. We contend that the purpose of statutory interpretation is to produce a constitutionally legitimate decoding of statutory commands in cases where the meaning of X and/or Y is contested. This perspective leads us to a unique conclusion about the conditions under which judges can use legislative records to more accurately decode a statute’s X’s and Y’s. Our attention to communication leads to these conditions because it clarifies how legislators compress the ideas in their heads, and in the collective understandings they reach, into the descriptions of X’s and Y’s that appear on statutory parchment. Many prominent claims about statutory interpretation are based on unrealistic (or unrecognizable) theories of how people decide which words to use when attempting to convey ideas to others. The consequences of proceeding in such a manner include opaque interpretative proscriptions that are difficult to apply uniformly or to reconcile with constitutional imperatives. We argue that importing a few basic scientific propositions about human communication dynamics can aid those who seek to determine what a statute’s authors meant when they chose to include (or not to include) particular words in a piece of legislation. To this end, we build from well-known communication theories. Their key insight is that successful inference about meaning requires {{the manner in which the}} communication is decoded (i. e., the expansion of the signal into information) relate to aspects of its manufacture (i. e., the compression of information into a signal) in particular ways. This insight highlights the importance for interpretive attempts of understanding the procedures by which legislators choose their words. It also provides important clues about the kinds of informational sources that can be useful to those who want to clarify the meaning of a statute’s X’s and Y’s. Better understanding the relationship between legislative rules and communicative incentives provides an improved framework for sorting credible sources of information about a statute’s meaning from sources that should be ignored. To this end, we use a positive political theory of communication-based legislative decision- making to help readers differentiate conditions for communicative sincerity from conditions for grandstanding and dissembling. The theory clarifies the conditions under which particular kinds of legislative records can be useful in decoding a statute’s X’s and Y’s (e. g., when they include detailed testimony about the meaning of an X or Y by either constitutionally empowered actors or by actors to whom constitutional authority was rightly delegated) by examining when legislative rules do, and do not, induce <b>sincere</b> <b>communication.</b> These conditions provide a template for better understanding when judges should ignore claims about a statute’s meaning and when legislative records can aid their search for meaning. statutory interpretation, strategic communication...|$|E
40|$|This is a pdf {{of three}} photos of sculptures {{exhibited}} at "The Secret Garden: Group Exhibition" and {{an invitation to}} the exhibition. Curatorial Statement The world has its diversity. It is the details of material and spirit and the details of their details that constitute both the signifier and the signified of the concept - “from regionalism to wholeness”. The intricate differentiated steps by which an art subject thinks and associates and their real-world equivalents fail all trials of objective description. This state is true to any spiritual phenomenon. Willing or not, an individual may communicate to others the way he thinks only to a very limited extent or in an obscure form. The complexity of things, situations and incidents and of spiritual existence all contributes to the diversity of the world. People in such a polysemous and coded world will have no way to go if refusing to communicate with their own language, color and thinking. Those states link, directly or indirectly, to the “secret garden” via their symbols under the contemporary spiritual context. It takes the communicability of the subject of art practice and his works for a <b>sincere</b> and effective <b>communication</b> to take place despite of the time and space and the situation - understandable or not. Differences existing between the west and east worlds in the habit of thinking, attitude to art, context-meaning connection, artistic fashion and skills, individual sensibility … all add to the “sense of being secret”, furthering and extending it to the extreme extent in a particular art object. However, it is through the very differences we get another significant chance to explore and understand the art expression. The 21 st edition of the vibrARTion project - “Secret Garden” Int’l Art Exhibition is a positive response to the strong demand of brilliant young artists, designers and other art learners and workers for more activities and programs that are both appropriate and influential on the collaboration of MoCA Beijing, The Peninsula Beijing and Bennington College.

40|$|Curriculum for kindergarten, a {{national}} document, intended for practitioners in kindergarten, dictates qualitative education of preschool children, whose main condition is a consistent and to common goals oriented work of practitioners, especially a tandem, {{which consists of}} a childcare worker and her assistant. Considering {{the fact that the}} childcare worker and her assistant are directly involved in work with preschool children, their common route in implementation of the curriculum principles is essential. If they both strive for <b>sincere</b> and qualitative <b>communication,</b> respect the rules set in the playroom, try to find solutions and professionally complement each other, we can talk about a successful and effective team (tandem). The empirical part of the research includes 72 kindergarten practitioners: childcare workers, their assistants, childcare workers as kindergarten managers, kindergarten managers, headteachers, headteachers' assistants and persons assisting children with special needs. The questionnaire was used in the research. Based on the results gained by the questionnaire, I think that childcare workers and their assistants are {{aware of the fact that}} team work is important. Most of their answers or opinions related to characteristics of effective teams, characteristics needed for a successful team work and the factors that lead to personal and professional matching of team members are similar. Their answers are slightly different when talking about team (re) formation. 1 / 3 of childcare workers and 1 / 5 of their assistants partially agree with the statement – If a team is successful, it is logical to leave the same people together, regardless the years of its duration. On the other side, the percentage of childworkers' assistants in comparison to childcare workers, who do not agree with the statement, is a bit lower. The opinion related to changing teams due to problems that can appear, has led to smaller differences among practitioners. There are more childcare workers' assistants than childcare workers who partially agree that in case of team problems it has to be changed, whereas almost a half of childcare workers' assistants and ¾ of childcare workers completely agree that the team should be changed if necessary. The statement that team should be changed on a given number of years has the following results: fewer childcare workers but more assistants completely agree with it. The differences among childcare workers and their assistants can be also seen in qualitative communication as one of successful team characteristics (1 / 4 of childcare workers and 1 / 3 of their assistants). Only successful teams or tandems offer children stimulative learning environment which provides social, emotional, intellectual and physical development. However, a very important aspect is also a stimulative interpersonal atmosphere that both practitioners create with their interactive relationship...|$|R
40|$|Viktor Frankl, a {{neurologist}} {{and the founder}} of logo-therapy (1969) stated that “will to meaning” is the basic essence of the universe (1). Logo-therapy means therapy through meaning, which is {{based on the premise that}} man has a will-to-meaning; the meaning thus lies in suffering(2). One of the most important human functions is discovering meaning in life, which is also considered as a sign of spiritual health(3). Defining illness by the patient is one of the most primary and significant implications for the formation of spiritual health(4). This study aimed to compare the Theory of Spiritual Well-being in nursing based on studies conducted in other countries with the theory of spiritual health according to Islamic teachings. Spiritual health theory is the theory of spiritual health in nursing. The main component of this holistic theory is to find the meaning of spirituality in the experience of illness. This theory can be taken into account in the care of patients in later stages, long-term chronic illnesses, and any kind of illness or injury that would challenge the person to find the purpose of life and the meaning of illness. In this theory, the patient is a person with the ability of finding the meaning of illness, which ultimately leads to their spiritual health (5). Conceptualization of spiritual health in Iran according to Islamic teachings has shown that spiritual health is a dynamic process oriented to the Creator’s proximity where the patient creates the meaning of his/her illness through wise, prudent, and <b>sincere</b> <b>communication</b> with oneself, the Creator, and others. On this continuum of excellence, different levels and qualities of romantic orientation by the Creator, religious rationality, task orientation, and hereafter prospectiveness can be observed in patients, causing psychological balance during illness and attribution of characteristics to the Creator(6). Differences between the theories mentioned above are as follows: 1. In the theory of spiritual health, the patient acquires spiritual meaning of illness, while in the conceptualization of spiritual health according to Islamic teachings, the patient creates meaning of illness. This difference is rooted in the exogenous and endogenous nature of spirituality. According to religious teachings, endogenous spiritual health focuses on the creation of meaning, while being autonomous and self-standing, background-oriented and valued, spontaneous and dynamic, progressive and constructive. However, exogenous spirituality focuses on the acquisition of meaning, mental spirituality, external and artificial products, while being dependent and attached, whim-oriented and acquired, worldly and instrumental, other-motivated and static, declining and dying (7). 2. In the conceptualization of spiritual health based on Islamic teachings, the patient thinks about himself, explores his moods and thoughts, reviews his past behavior, thinks about his values ​​and beliefs, and tries to figure out whether his past behavior, moods, and thoughts have been coordinated with his value and belief systems (6,  7). 3. In the Theory of Spiritual Well-being, social support is addressed as a contributing factor for the formation of spiritual well-being. It seems that while connection with others is considered as a two-way communication in the conceptualization of spiritual health model based on, a one-way communication link has been reported between the patient and others (6). 4. Another difference in the mentioned conceptualization models is that while spiritual health conceptual model is based on Islamic teachings, the spiritual well-being conceptual model does not take components such as hereafter prospectiveness, task orientation, and mental balance into account (6). In general, it could be concluded that since the search for meaning and spiritual health are context-driven concepts, and significant differences have been observed in their conceptualization based on various cultures, it is recommended that the healthcare system pay especial attention to this crucial issue in order to effectively perform interventions and cares to promote spiritual health of patients...|$|E
40|$|Anna Cullhed, "Hur grufligt - - - - O Natur! – – hur ljuft, at vara Mor!" Moderskapets blick i Bengt Lidners opera{{libretto}} Medea. ("How dreadful - - - - O Nature! – – {{how sweet}} to be a Mother!" The Gaze of Motherhood in Bengt Lidner's Opera Libretto Medea.) This essay {{focuses on the}} Swedish 18 th-century poet Bengt Lidner's libretto Medea from the early 1780 's. His early manuscript version {{is seen as a}} radical experiment with emotional expression, as it turns the classical myth into a drama about motherhood, the family and the problem of sentimental communication. The mother's gaze becomes a focal point for the interpretation, as it stands for an ideal connection between the good mother and her child. The lack of attachment, on the other hand, anticipates disaster: the mother slays her own child. Lidner's version of the ancient Medea tale is interpreted in connection with the debate on child murder in the late 18 th century. The Medea theme was common in 18 th-century drama in several European countries, as in Goethe's Faust. The literary representation of the Medea/ child-murder theme shows important differences in comparison to legal sources. Medea as mother and the murderous mothers of the court cases were met with an increasing degree of sympathy in the late 18 th century. In contrast, the fictional fathers were condemned to a greater extent, while real fathers of illegitimate children were generally freed by the courts {{towards the end of the}} century. The Swedish historian Karin Hassan Jansson suggests that while men of the 17 th century were expected to control their passions, especially in their roles as heads of the household, 18 th-century men were defined as naturally sexual beings, and thus less responsible for acts such as rape. Rank and lineage, important drives in the ancient Medea tragedies by Euripides and Seneca, are replaced by the purely emotional ties of the intimate 18 th-century family. Jason turns into an inconstant husband, who abandons Medea in favour of a younger bride. Medea, on the other hand, is in Lidner's version fully transformed into a loving and caring mother and wife. Medea's expressions of conflicting emotions towards her sons and her husband reveal the obstacles to <b>sincere</b> <b>communication.</b> In accordance with Rousseau, in his early essay on the origin of language, Lidner suggests that gestures are to be seen as more authentic compared to conventional language. Jean Starobinski's term "transparency" is crucial to the argument that 18 th-century authors are concerned with the issue of communicative means, and the relation between language, gestures, and music. Rousseau developed the genre melodrama to meet his own ideals. The French dramatist Baculard d'Arnaud is of specific importance to the study, since his theoretical discussions of the expression of emotions on stage use Medea as an example. Lidner depends on several models, such as the already mentioned Baculard d'Arnaud, but also the German author Friedrich Wilhelm Gotter. In contrast to the ancient tragedies, the two sons of Medea and Jason enter the stage as speaking characters in the 18 th century. They speak, they act, and they plead in their function as carriers of innocence and virtue. Lidner's version is exceptional in its emotional address. At one point, Medea calls herself a pelican, and expresses her wish to nourish her children with her own blood. The pelican is an age-old symbol for Christ. Further, she wishes to envelop her children in her open breast, a wish that explores the Christian allegory even further. The side wound of Christ is considered a hiding place for the soul, a metaphorical expression favoured by the Moravian movement. In his search for an adequate emotional expression, Lidner transgresses not only the borders between divine and worldly spheres, but also of gender. The same kind of trans­gression concerns the members of the family. Medea wants to take revenge on Jason, and she claims to see Jason when she threatens her own sons. One of the sons replies that the dagger will pierce herself, Medea, should she thrust the dagger into his heart. The issues of transparency, of paternal guilt and of motherhood are related to the histo­rian Lynn Hunt's study The Family Romance of the French Revolution. However, in Lidner's libretto, Medea is absolved of guilt. The intensity of her love, according to Lidner, acquits her, even though she kills her own sons. Paradoxically, the murderous mother is at the same time the ideal mother in this late 18 th-century version of the Medea myth...|$|E
