The lower-priced Handyman station wagon, a four-door model in 1953-54, became a two-door for 1955-57. Both were joined by a nine-passenger Beauville four-door wagon in 1956-57.|$|E

Supers had four of the new round VentiPorts per fender this year, with additional series script found on rear quarters and within the deck emblem. The side Sweepspear was unchanged from 1954. The larger bodied Buicks were readily identified by their more rounded contours, straight up windshield pillars and sedan rear quarter windows. Series 50 Super and 70 Roadmaster headlamp bezels also housed parking lights. Inside, a new Red Liner speedometer lay horizontally across the instrument panel. Interiors were trimmed in nylon/Cordaveen combinations, except for the convertible which featured leather seats.

5000|$|As {{part of its}} 1995 Mid-cycle refresh, the {{interior}} saw {{a greater degree of}} change than the exterior. To bring the design up to date (and in line {{with the rest of the}} Lincoln line), the dashboard and door panels featured a curved design, while influenced by the Mark VIII, the 6-passenger design of the Town Car precluded the adoption of a center console in {{the interior}}. To increase storage space, the dual center armrests of the front seats on Signature and Cartier models were redesigned to include storage compartments (to hold cassettes and the optional cellular telephone). The dashboard design continued into the new door panels, now with an illuminated power window and <b>seat</b> <b>adjuster</b> cluster, and back-lit power door lock switch placed higher on the door. Releases for the trunk and fuel door were moved from the dashboard onto the lower driver's door. Redesigned seat patterns now offered an available driver and front passenger electric heat feature. The radio antenna was integrated into the rear window. [...] Although the basic controls of the interior remained common across all Panther vehicles, the Town Car gained a model-specific instrument panel, featuring italicized readouts.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{operating}} noise performance of a <b>seat</b> <b>adjuster</b> mechanism, benchmarking measurements were conducted in different cars for six and eight types of seat adjustment operation. The six types of operation include: seat moving up, seat moving down, seat front end up, seat front end down, seat rear end up and seat rear end down. The eight types of operation include: seat moving forward, seat moving backward, seat moving up, seat moving down, seat front end up, seat front end down, seat rear end up and seat rear end down. The noise and vibration levels, sound quality and root causes of the noise problem have been analysed and discussed in this paper. The noise characteristics have been identified, and the psychoacoustic parameters {{have been used to}} quantify sound quality of the <b>seat</b> <b>adjuster.</b> The objective assessment results have been found to match well with subjective evaluation results...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{perceived}} quality of powered seat adjusters {{based on their}} sound during operation has become a primary concern for vehicle and seat manufacturers. Historical noise targets based on overall dB(A) at the occupant’s ear have consistently proved inadequate {{as a measure of}} the sound quality of a <b>seat</b> <b>adjuster.</b> Significant effort has been devoted to develop alternative sound quality metrics that can truly discriminate between “good ” and “bad ” seat adjusters. These new metrics have been successfully applied for some years by product development engineers in test labs. However, in the assembly plant the sound quality of the <b>seat</b> <b>adjuster</b> is still assessed subjectively by an operator {{at the end of the}} assembly line. The main problem with this approach is not only the lack of consistency and repeatability across large samples of seat tracks, but also the fact that the only feedback provided from the end-of-line to the product development team is of subjective nature. This subjective information is of little help for the engineers who have to diagnose and remedy the problem. Additionally, since sound quality has become one of the main reasons for rejection at the end of the assembly line, there is the need for integrating sound quality performance checks with the standard quality control or functional checks in the manufacturing environment. Therefore, the new challenge for the <b>seat</b> <b>adjuster</b> manufacturer is to implement at the end of the assembly line an automated Sound Quality-based inspection system that relies exclusively on objective parameters. The authors of this paper have devoted a lot of effort toward developing such a system, and this paper will describe and discuss the main issues related to its design, implementation and validation...|$|E

However, availability and usage of such tools amongst fine element (FE) analysts has been relatively poor because of the inability to save or reuse computational time and effort taken during a FE analysis. This paper presents an innovative methodology that utilises substructures to enable collaboration for FE analysis in vehice design.

40|$|An {{application}} of a novel methodology in a redesign of the load bearing subassembly of an automotive <b>seat</b> <b>adjuster</b> is presented. This novel methodology efficiently evaluated concept variations {{at a higher rate}} than the traditional approach based on FEA and therefore enables a comparison of the objective spaces rather than undesirable point design comparisons. This significant increase in efficiency increased the amount of generated knowledge that was presented to the design engineer in a form of the Pareto front comparisons. The comparisons of the Pareto fronts allowed for a clear identification of Concept # 3 as the preferred solution, given the load-bearing and the light weighting criteria only. The results also indicated that Concept # 2 could also be promising solution after major enhancements, as it showed potential to outperform the current solution in some cases...|$|E
5000|$|Parliament may {{determine}} the number of members of the House of Representatives but the Constitution provides that this number must be [...] "as nearly as practicable, twice the number of Senators"; this requirement is commonly called the [...] "nexus provision". Hence, the House presently consists of 150 members. Each state is allocated seats based on its population; however, each original state, regardless of size, is guaranteed at least five seats. The Constitution does not guarantee representation for the territories. Parliament granted a seat to the Northern Territory in 1922, and to the Australian Capital Territory in 1948; these territorial representatives, however, had only limited voting rights until 1968.
