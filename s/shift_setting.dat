[...] "Unusually extroverted" [...] was what magistrates asked Mack Scogin Merrill Elam to deliver {{for the design of}} a $63 million federal courthouse in Austin, Texas. New York Times architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff wrote that the building exhibited a tension [...] "between the desire to uphold core democratic values and a growing sense of instability". The building is conceived as an eight-story cube, its interlocking forms resting on a concrete base. Deep recesses set into the building create a play of light and shadow. The visual game continues inside, where the walls and walkways enclosing a lobby atrium dissolve into a cubist composition of intersecting planes. The lightness of the forms recalls the theoretical structures of Frederick Kiesler, the utopian who imagined weightless buildings suspended in air.

40|$|This study {{presented}} a comprehensive overview of Attentional Control Theory. Attentional Control Theory states that individuals high in trait anxiety {{are likely to}} experience an impairment in both <b>shifting</b> <b>set</b> and inhibition sub-components of the central executive. This impairment involves the processing efficiency of completing each of these tasks. The underlying neural frequency of alpha band activity was measured for individuals low and high in trait anxiety as they completed both <b>shifting</b> <b>set</b> and inhibition tasks. The results demonstrate that individuals high and low in trait anxiety demonstrated similar average response times for completion of both tasks. Despite this, the alpha band differences observed suggest that individuals high in trait anxiety may be experiencing a relaxed state at rest, but undergo {{a significant increase in}} alertness for the completion of an inhibition task. In addition, alpha activity differences showed that both high and low trait anxious individuals experience a similar level of cognitive activity during completion on the <b>shifting</b> <b>set</b> task. These results provide a foundation for understanding the underlying neural correlates of Attentional Control Theory, and provide several implications for the processing differences experienced by high and low trait anxious individuals.

Finally, we prove that our subset selection method can consistently deal with both scenarios of covariate shift.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the operations problems in non-profit hospital call centers with inbound and outbound calls service blending. First, the routing policy for inbound and outbound calls is considered. The objective {{is to improve the}} system utilization under constraints of service quality and operators 2 ̆ 7 quantity. A collection of practical staffing assignment methods, separating and mixing staffing policy are evaluated. Erlang C queuing model is used to decide the minimum number of operators required by inbound calls. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments illustrate that through dynamically assigning the inbound and outbound calls to operators under optimal threshold policy, mixing staffing policy is efficient to balance the system utilization and service quality. Numerical experiments based on real-life data demonstrate how this method can be applied in practice. Second, we study the staffing shift planning problem based on the inbound and outbound calls routing policies. A mathematical programming model is developed, based on a hospital call center with one kind of inbound calls and multiple kinds of outbound calls. The objective is to minimize the staffing numbers, by deciding the <b>shift</b> <b>setting</b> and workload allocation. The inbound calls service level and staffing utilization are taken into consideration in the constraints. Numerical experiments based on actual operational data are included. Results show that the model is effective to optimize the shift planning and hence reduce the call centers 2 ̆ 7 cost. Third, we model the staffing shift planning problem for a hospital call center with two kinds of service lines. Each kind of service is delivered through both inbound calls and outbound calls. The inbound calls can be transferred between these two service lines. A mathematical programming model is developed. The objective is to minimize the staffing cost, by deciding the <b>shift</b> <b>setting</b> and workload allocation. The inbound calls service level and staffing utilization are taken into consideration in the constraints. Numerical experiments are carried out based on actual operational data.

40|$|Set-shifting is an {{important}} aspect of attention and regulation of behaviour. The ability of young children to <b>shift</b> <b>set</b> is debated. Set-shifting is usually examined using sorting tasks that are designed for adults and hence are inadequate for children. In this study, an experimental Sorting Task for Children (STC) is administered to 54 healthy children (aged 4 to 10 years) and compared with a widely used adult sorting task, the Modified Card Sorting Test. This experiment shows that preschool children are capable of set-shifting. An extensive error analysis of the STG reveals that perseverations are not predominant. Hence, set-shifting in young children may be characterised by 'trial and error' rather than by being stuck in a mental set, which is suggested to be typical of adults with frontal lobe damage.

We investigated cognitive control impairments, including difficulties with task switching, failure of response inhibition, and inability to adjust speed of responding. Participants included 16 subjects with psychopathic traits (Ps), and 22 healthy controls (HCs). We recorded behavioral responses during a Task Switching paradigm, a probe of flexible behavioral adaptation to changing contexts; and a Go/NoGo Task, which assesses response inhibition and indexes behavioral impulsivity. During task switching, Ps evidenced impairments <b>shifting</b> <b>set</b> when conflicting (incongruent) information was presented, but performed as well as HCs {{in the absence of}} such conflict.

40|$|Background: Patients with {{anorexia}} nervosa have been consistently reported to show impairments in <b>set</b> <b>shifting</b> ability. Such deficits {{may be associated}} with characteristics commonly observed in this patient group, such as obsessive thoughts and behaviours around eating, maladaptive problem solving and a rigid thinking style. Objective: Much of the preceding literature on <b>set</b> <b>shifting</b> ability has involved inpatient samples meeting strict diagnostic criteria for {{anorexia nervosa}}. However most eating disorder patients are outpatients and commonly do not meet full criteria for anorexia nervosa. This study thus aimed to investigate the relationship between <b>set</b> <b>shifting</b> ability and psychological characteristics in a community sample of outpatients with symptoms of anorexia nervosa. Methods: Performance on selected measures of set-shifting ability (Wisconsin Card Sort Test, WCST; Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, Hayling & Brixton) were compared between an eating disorders group comprising 17 female outpatients with symptoms of anorexia nervosa and a control group comprising 27 students. <b>Set</b> <b>shifting</b> performance was then correlated with eating disorder severity (Eating Disorders Examination), obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale), and the Social Problem Solving Inventory. Results: The eating disorder group demonstrated significantly worse <b>set</b> <b>shifting</b> ability than the healthy control group on the primary outcome measure (WCST), with 47 % of eating disorder participants showing impairment on this measure. Severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and an impulsive and careless approach to problem solving were associated with poorer scores on the WCST in the eating disorder group. Although the eating disorder group were significantly more impaired in <b>set</b> <b>shifting</b> than controls, <b>set</b> <b>shifting</b> ability was not associated with eating disorder severity. Conclusions: The results indicate that <b>set</b> <b>shifting</b> impairments are present in outpatients with eating disorders with anorexic symptoms, and may be trait characteristics. Impaired <b>set</b> <b>shifting</b> was associated with obsessive-compulsive symptoms and maladaptive problem solving. These findings highlight a need for neuropsychological assessment of eating disorder outpatients in order to identify individuals who may benefit from psychological interventions to reduce the impact of these impairments.
