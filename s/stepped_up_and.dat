5|$|Republican {{movements}} in Europe remain active up to present. The most prominent organisations campaigning to eliminate {{one or more}} of Europe's remaining monarchies and/or to liquidate assets reserved for reigning families are affiliated with the Alliance of European Republican Movements, but there are smaller independent initiatives as well, such as Hetis2013 in the Netherlands. Also, some political parties (e.g. Podemos in Spain) have <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> called for national referenda to abolish monarchies.|$|E
5|$|On December 10, 2010, {{expansion}} team Western New York Flash {{announced that they}} had agreed {{to terms with the}} Canadian striker for the 2011 season. Sinclair helped guide the team to the regular season championship, leading the club with ten goals and eight assists. On August 27, 2011, Sinclair was named MVP of the 2011 WPS Championship Final after the Flash won the championship in Rochester, New York. Sinclair's goal in the 64th minute gave the Flash a 1–0 lead over Philadelphia. When the game was forced to penalty kicks, Sinclair <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> completed the second one as the Flash players converted all five of their attempts.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Escape from Butcher Bay, Starbreeze again {{encountered}} financial difficulties after having not received a significant royalty payment from Vivendi. It sold part of its motion capture and animation department to a British company, Centroid. However, the game helped set Starbreeze's reputation as a studio capable of making good licensed titles. With the help of Union Entertainment, an intermediary company, Starbreeze {{signed an agreement with}} Majesco Entertainment for a new title set within The Darkness universe owned by Top Cow Comics on July 16, 2004. Midway through the game's development, Majesco underwent restructuring because of financial difficulties, shifted its focus, and dropped the game. 2K Games <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> acquired the publishing rights. 2K extended the game's development cycle, and asked Starbreeze to develop a multiplayer mode for the game. The Darkness was released in 2007. It fared worse than the team expected critically, but its commercial performance was satisfactory, selling more than 1 million copies worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Feyenoord were {{paired with}} fellow Dutch side PSV Eindhoven in the quarter–finals, and the tie {{came down to}} a penalty shootout, which Feyenoord won 5–4. The first leg was drawn 1–1 with Feyenoord taking the lead in first half injury time through Pierre van Hooijdonk. PSV {{equalised}} two minutes after the restart when Mateja Kežman scored on 47 minutes. The second leg was again drawn 1–1, with PSV taking the lead on 75 minutes, when Mark van Bommel scored from outside the penalty area. That looked to have sent PSV into the semi-finals, but with seconds remaining, Van Hooijdonk scored from Johan Elmander's cross to send the tie into extra-time. PSV were reduced to ten men in extra time when Van Bommel was sent off for a second bookable offence but they still managed to hold out for the extra 30 minutes to force a penalty shootout. All penalties were converted until Giorgi Gakhokidze <b>stepped</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> saw his penalty saved. Feyenoord converted their subsequent penalties, with Van Hooijdonk putting away the vital fifth penalty.|$|E
5|$|Galatasaray's Ergün Penbe {{stepped up}} {{to take the first}} spot kick and scored. He placed the ball inside the near {{right-hand}} corner, just past Seaman, who dived to his left. Davor Šuker was the first man up to take Arsenal's penalty kick. His effort proved to be unsuccessful, as the ball hit the left-hand post and bounced off the goal. Şükür became the next player to take Galatasaray's spot kick. He scored as he lobbed the ball in the right-hand corner. With Galatasaray leading 2–0, Arsenal's next penalty taker was Parlour. He placed the ball on the spot and successfully scored by burying the ball to Taffarel's right to make it 2–1. Ümit Davala calmly placed the goal, near the centre of the goal to make it 3–1 to Galatasaray. Arsenal's only hope now was Vieira, but the midfielder missed and hit the crossbar instead. Popescu then <b>stepped</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> netted with a powerful shot, as Galatasaray won the penalty shoot-out 4–1.|$|E
5|$|Hassett had a {{new role}} as the teams headed to Headingley for the Fourth Test. He would improvise and open with Morris, as regular opener Sid Barnes was injured. Hassett dropped Len Hutton—who went on to score 81—on 25. Hassett {{struggled}} {{to make an impact}} in the unfamiliar role, scoring 13 and 17. However, the other Australian batsmen <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> scored 3/404 in 330 minutes on the final day to set a new world record for the highest successful Test runchase, ensuring an unassailable 3–0 series lead. Hassett scored two fifties in the lead-up to the Fifth Test, where he returned to his customary role with the return of Barnes. Hassett took a diving catch in the first innings and scored 37 in an innings win. Australia thus won the series convincingly 4–0 and Hassett finished the series with 310 runs at 44.29.|$|E

5|$|The postwar {{years were}} spent {{implementing}} {{the lessons of}} the Yom Kippur War. SEAD tactics were improved, training was <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> innovative technologies introduced. The Hammers cooperated with Rafael, Israel's weapon systems development authority, in the introduction of the Tadmit electro-optical fire-and-forget guided bomb, {{a modified version of the}} AGM-62 Walleye II. At the same time, the Phantom's air-to-air role was diminished with the introduction into service of the F-15 Eagle and the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The squadron was, nonetheless, the first IAF squadron to introduce Rafael's Python 3 into service in March 1977. Air-to-air training continued and on December 29, 1977, during combat against a pair of F-15s, two squadron aircraft collided. Squadron leader Avsha Friedman and navigator Avihu Ikar were killed. The remains of their aircraft, Kurnass 305, stand as a memorial to the two pilots on the Acre-Carmiel road. On January 20, 1981, the squadron lost another pilot in similar circumstances, when Kurnass 222 collided with F-16 222. Squadron leader Eliezer Adar ejected, but Dani Weiss was killed, as was the F-16 pilot, Uri Ben-Amitai.|$|E

25|$|There {{are large}} {{gaps in the}} {{knowledge}} of the earliest Swedish regents. However, the last king who followed the old Norse religion was Blot-Sweyn, who reigned 1084–87. According to legend, Blot-Sweyn became king when his predecessor Inge refused to sacrifice at Uppsala. His brother-in-law Sweyn <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> agreed to sacrifice, which gave him the nickname Blot, which means sacrifice. Inge took out his revenge three years later, when he entered Uppsala with a great force, set Blot-Sweyn's house ablaze, and killed him as he attempted to flee the burning wreckage.|$|E

However, it is also said that the authorities implore students not to use the characters in public. Due to North Korea's strict isolationism, accurate reports about hanja use in North Korea are hard to obtain.|$|E
25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 246, when the Shu {{government}} proclaimed a general amnesty, Meng Guang <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> scolded Fei Yi, {{the head of the}} central government, in front of the entire imperial court. He argued that a general amnesty, as a policy, should only be implemented under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., as a political move to gain popular support especially in times of instability) and as a last resort. In his opinion, as Shu was rather peaceful and stable at the time, a general amnesty would benefit criminals instead of improving the government's public image. Fei Yi apologised to Meng Guang in a polite but awkward manner.|$|E
25|$|The Steelers {{took the}} opening kickoff and drove 67 yards to a score on Neil O'Donnell's 16-yard {{touchdown}} pass to fullback John L. Williams. O'Donnell also made two big completions to Andre Hastings on the drive, the first for 18 yards, and the second for 11 yards on fourth down and 2. Later in the quarter, the Chargers got a big opportunity when safety Darren Carrington recovered a fumble from Steelers running back Barry Foster on the San Diego 41, but Pittsburgh's defense <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> forced a punt. Pittsburgh then advanced {{the ball to the}} Chargers 27-yard line, but a holding penalty pushed them out of field goal range and they ended up punting it back.|$|E
