40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Coagulase-negative <b>staphylococci</b> {{have emerged}} as the most common {{nosocomial}} pathogen in neonatal intensive care units worldwide. Our understanding of the interactions between coagulase-negative <b>staphylococci</b> and the immune system is incomplete, especially in the newborn. This review summarizes current knowledge on the human immune response to coagulase-negative <b>staphylococci,</b> with particular emphasis on the neonatal innate immune system. RECENT FINDINGS: There are very limited data on innate immune responses to coagulase-negative <b>staphylococci</b> in neonates. Levels of serum proteins, including transplacental anti-coagulase-negative <b>staphylococci</b> immunoglobulin and complement, correlate with gestational age, and this relative deficiency in preterm infants contributes to their suboptimal opsonization and impaired bacterial killing of coagulase-negative <b>staphylococci.</b> In adults, coagulase-negative <b>staphylococci</b> elicit significant cytokine responses in vitro, which are probably partly mediated by Toll-like receptors, including Toll-like receptor type 2, but these pathways have not been characterized in the high-risk neonatal population. SUMMARY: The susceptibility of human preterm neonates to coagulase-negative <b>staphylococci</b> relates partly to the immaturity of the neonatal immune response. Strategies to reduce the burden of coagulase-negative <b>staphylococci</b> infections require {{a thorough understanding of}} host-pathogen interactions, particularly the engagement of coagulase-negative <b>staphylococci</b> by the neonatal innate immune system...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the fluoroquinolone susceptibilities of ocular isolate coagulase-negative <b>staphylococci</b> (CoNS), identified at the Microbiology Laboratory - UNIFESP. DESIGN: Experimental laboratory investigation. METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 21 strains of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative <b>staphylococci</b> (MRCoNS) and 22 methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative <b>staphylococci</b> (MSCoNS) to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined, using the E-test method standardized by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI/NCCLS). RESULTS: The MIC 90 s (µg/ml) {{for the second}} generation of tested fluoroquinolones were higher than the fourth generation, especially for the methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative <b>staphylococci</b> group. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative <b>staphylococci</b> {{are more susceptible to}} quinolones than are methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative <b>staphylococci</b> and that fourth generation fluoroquinolones appear to be more potent, affecting even coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains resistant to second generation fluoroquinolones...|$|R

40|$|Untreated heavy nasal {{carriers}} of <b>staphylococci</b> {{have been reported}} to have <b>staphylococci</b> on their skin more frequently and to disseminate staphylo-cocci in the air in larger numbers than either non-carriers or {{carriers of}} smaller numbers of these bacteria (1). If the nose is the main source of skin and aerial <b>staphylococci,</b> suppression of nasal <b>staphylococci</b> should be followed by a reduction in both aerial dissemination and skin carriage. Of the presently available systemically adminis-tered antibiotics, only methicillin (dimethoxy-phenyl penicillin) has been reported to eradicate <b>staphylococci</b> from nasal carriers without overt staphylococcal infections at other sites in hos-pitals where a large proportion of these organisms is multiple-drug-resistant (2 - 6).

40|$|Recent {{studies by}} Cohn and Morse have {{indicated}} that pathogenic strains of <b>staphylococci</b> are not phagocytosed in systems containing rabbit serum and polymorphonuclear leukocytes {{in the absence of}} specific, thermostable opsonin (1). These studies have further suggested that both pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of <b>staphylococci</b> are equally susceptible to rapid destruction within the cytoplasm of rabbit leukocytes once phagocytosis has been accomplished. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that there are significant differences in the intracellular disposition of coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative <b>staphylococci</b> following ingestion by human leukocytes (2). Pathogenic, coagulase-positive strains appear to survive within the cytoplasm of human granulocytes while non-pathogenic coagulase-negative strains are rapidly destroyed following ingestion. Observations on the course of staphylococcal bacteriemia in rabbits performed in our laboratory have also suggested that the survival of pathogenic strains within rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes {{may play a role in}} the persistence of <b>staphylococci</b> in the rabbit blood stream (3, 4). In view of the findings of Cohn and Morse, studies on the behavior of <b>staphylococci</b> within human leukocytes have been extended, and the factors in human serum which promote phagocytosis have been explored. The present paper reports these observations. This study supports the thesis that a specific opsonin is required for prompt phagocytosis of pathogenic <b>staphylococci</b> in siliconed glass systems. Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, like rabbit granulocytes, do not phagocytose coagulase-positive <b>staphylococci</b> in such in vitro systems in the absence of a specific serum factor.

40|$|A {{specific}} serum {{factor was}} required for rapid phagocytosis of pathogenic <b>staphylococci</b> by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes when the ingestion process was studied in siliconed glass systems and the concentrations of <b>staphylococci</b> were maintained at low levels. In contrast to certain other microbes, the resistance to phagocytosis which characterized pathogenic <b>staphylococci</b> was relative, and phagocytosis was readily accomplished when large populations of <b>staphylococci</b> {{were present in the}} test system. A factor promoting phagocytosis was present in eight of eight normal adult sera. In contrast, the sera of twenty-eight of thirty normal rabbits did not promote phagocytosis. Serum obtained from 2 rabbits maintained in the rabbit colony for several months acquired the ability to opsonize pathogenic <b>staphylococci.</b> The phagocytosis-promoting factor was almost completely removed by prior absorption of test sera with the homologous strain. The factor was incompletely removed by absorption with heterologous strains of pathogenic <b>staphylococci</b> and was not significantly reduced by absorption with coagulase-negative <b>staphylococci</b> or unrelated microorganisms. Present evidence suggests that the factor promoting phagocytosis is a thermostable opsonin. While the activity of heated serum could not be restored by the addition of small amounts of fresh serum or complement, the addition of large amounts of complement partially restored opsonic activity. Incubation of <b>staphylococci</b> in fresh serum prior to heat inactivation did not reduce subsequent phagocytosis, further suggesting the heat stability of the phagocytosis-promoting factor. Preliminary studies correlating the presence of antistaphylococcal hemagglutinins and phagocytosis-promoting factor in certain sera suggest that the two factors were not necessarily related. The phagocytosis of <b>staphylococci</b> in fresh human serum was inhibited by the addition of fresh or inactivated rabbit serum. Further studies on the nature of such inhibition are in progress. Once ingestion was accomplished, coagulase-positive <b>staphylococci</b> consistently survived in significant numbers within the cytoplasm of human granulocytes. Coagulase-negative <b>staphylococci</b> appeared to be destroyed within the leukocyte and could not be recultured from the cytoplasm following 3 to 4 hours of intracellular residence...|$|R
