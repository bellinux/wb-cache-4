5|$|The circle symbolizes {{unity and}} {{diversity}} in nature, and many Islamic patterns are drawn {{starting with a}} circle. For example, the decoration of the 15th-century mosque in Yazd, Iran {{is based on a}} circle, divided into six by six circles drawn around it, all touching at its centre and each touching its two neighbours' centres to form a regular hexagon. On this basis is constructed a six-pointed star surrounded by six smaller irregular hexagons to form a tessellating <b>star</b> <b>pattern.</b> This forms the basic design which is outlined in white {{on the wall of the}} mosque. That design, however, is overlaid with an intersecting tracery in blue around tiles of other colours, forming an elaborate pattern that partially conceals the original and underlying design. A similar design forms the logo of the Mohammed Ali Research Center.|$|E
25|$|A , {{similar in}} {{appearance}} and function to a hole punch or chisel, {{is used as}} a hand powered drill in conjunction with a hammer to drill into stone and masonry. A star drill bit's cutting edge consists of several blades joined at the center to form a <b>star</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|E
25|$|The main nave is {{enormous}} and very tall. At the front is an apse, which like the area under the choir has a vault with Gothic nerves which form a <b>star</b> <b>pattern.</b> The current main altar found {{here is not}} the original. The original altar was Baroque which contained twelve paintings {{with each of the}} Apostles as well as one of John the Baptist and Saint Augustine. These paintings have since been moved to the pinacotheca of the Cuernavaca cathedral. The current altar is a large white 19th century Neoclassical style piece, inspired by a Roman mausoleum. It has two levels on a circular base with a Corinthian style capitol. It features an image of John the Baptist.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} simple method for {{rendering}} Islamic <b>star</b> <b>patterns</b> based on Hankin’s “polygons-in-contact ” technique. The method builds <b>star</b> <b>patterns</b> from a tiling {{of the plane}} and {{a small number of}} intuitive parameters. We show how this method can be adapted to construct Islamic designs reminiscent of Huff’s parquet deformations. Finally, we introduce a geometric transformation on tilings that expands the range of patterns accessible using our method. This transformation simplifies construction techniques given in previous work, and clarifies previously unexplained relationships between certain classes of <b>star</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R
40|$|We present Najm, a set {{of tools}} built on the axioms of {{absolute}} geometry for exploring the design space of Islamic <b>star</b> <b>patterns.</b> Our approach makes use of a novel family of tilings, called “inflation tilings, ” which are particularly well suited as guides for creating <b>star</b> <b>patterns.</b> We describe a method for creating a parameterized set of motifs {{that can be used}} to fill the many regular polygons that comprise these tilings, as well as an algorithm to infer geometry for any irregular polygons that remain. Erasing the underlying tiling and joining together the inferred motifs produces the <b>star</b> <b>patterns.</b> By choice, Najm is build upon the subset of geometry that makes no assumption about the behavior of parallel lines. As a consequence, <b>star</b> <b>patterns</b> created by Najm can be designed equally well to fit the Euclidean plane, the hyperbolic plane, or the surface of a sphere...|$|R

25|$|The twin-domes of the Sultaniyya complex (c. 1360) and {{the narrow}} dome of Yunus al-Dawadar (c. 1385) are unusual {{in that they}} have muqarnas {{at the base of}} their {{external}} ribs, a feature of ribbed domes in Persia. The first example of the zigzag pattern is on the dome of Mahmud al-Kurdi (1394–95), and at least fourteen subsequent domes also used it. The first example of a dome in Cairo with a <b>star</b> <b>pattern</b> is the mausoleum of al-Ashraf Barsbay. The dome of Qaytbay in Cairo's northern cemetery combines geometric and arabesque patterns {{and is one of the}} finest. Internally, the squinches of the zone of transition developed into miniaturized and pointed versions that were used row upon row over the entire expanded zone and bordered above and below by plain surfaces. Bulbous cupolas on minarets were used in Egypt beginning around 1330, spreading to Syria in the following century.|$|E
25|$|The Serpent Mound {{may have}} been {{designed}} {{in accord with the}} pattern of stars composing the constellation Draco. The <b>star</b> <b>pattern</b> of the constellation Draco fits with fair precision to the Serpent Mound, with the ancient Pole Star, Thuban (α Draconis), at its geographical center within the first of seven coils from the head. The fact that the body of Serpent Mound follows the pattern of Draco may support various theses. Putnam's 1865 refurbishment of the earthwork could have been correctly accomplished in that a comparison of Romain's or Fletcher and Cameron's maps from the 1980s show how the margins of the Serpent align with great accuracy to a large portion of Draco. Some researchers date the earthwork to around 5,000 years ago, based on the position of Draco, through the backward motion of precessionary circle of the ecliptic when Thuban was the Pole Star. Alignment of the effigy to the Pole Star at that position also shows how true north {{may have been}} found. This was not known until 1987 because lodestone and modern compasses give incorrect readings at the site.|$|E

40|$|This work {{makes the}} {{contribution}} of developing a parametric modeler for designing Islamic <b>star</b> <b>patterns.</b> The intention here is to innovate with new interpretations of <b>star</b> <b>patterns</b> for latticed screens, which are reminiscent of the Indo-Mughal era. With a motivation for providing traditional appearance to the buildings like resorts and hotels, traditional latticed screens with Islamic <b>star</b> <b>patterns</b> are used as a fundamental resource to archive decorative effects. Such latticed screens have been generated by using computer aided geometric modeling and manufacturing for commercial applications {{in the domain of}} architectural as well as interior decoration. <b>Star</b> <b>patterns</b> are realized as periodic and repeated arrangement of a type of motifs/compound-motifs. Further, motif/compound-motif is viewed as polar array of a primitive which is an atomic geometric object required for the representation of motif/compound-motif. Geometry of the primitives for motifs is defined in the form a planar map having a set of points. The positions of points are devised in terms of the modeling parameters and pairs of points are connected to generate a set of edges. By controlling the modeling parameters through a User Interface, patterns are rendered and further submitted to computer controlled laser cutting machine for fabrication. the room during the day as sunlight streams through it, the pattern forms magical shadow and graces the adjacent floors and walls (see Figure 1). Being such a useful architectural accessory, this work has laid emphasis on the decoration of latticed screens with Islamic art which mostly focus on the depiction of <b>star</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R
50|$|Star lore or starlore is the {{creating}} and cherishing of mythical {{stories about the}} <b>stars</b> and <b>star</b> <b>patterns</b> (constellations and asterisms); that is, folklore based upon the <b>stars</b> and <b>star</b> <b>patterns.</b> Using the <b>stars</b> to explain religious doctrines or actual events in history is also defined as star lore.

500|$|A 2012 re-release, {{also known}} as Titanic in 3D, was created by re-mastering the {{original}} to 4K resolution and post-converting to stereoscopic 3D format. The Titanic 3D version took 60 weeks and $18million to produce, including the 4K restoration. [...] The 3D conversion was performed by Stereo D and Sony with Slam Content's Panther Records remastering the soundtrack. Digital 2D and in 2D IMAX versions were also struck from the new 4K master created in the process. For the 3D release, Cameron opened up the Super 35 film and expanded {{the image of the}} film into a new aspect ratio, from 2:35:1 to 1:78:1, allowing the viewer to see more image on {{the top and bottom of}} the screen. The only scene entirely redone for the re-release was Rose's view of the night sky at sea, on the morning of April 15, 1912. The scene was replaced with an accurate view of the night-sky <b>star</b> <b>pattern,</b> including the Milky Way, adjusted for the location in the North Atlantic Ocean in April 1912. The change was prompted by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who had criticized the scene for showing an unrealistic <b>star</b> <b>pattern.</b> He agreed to send film director Cameron a corrected view of the sky, which was the basis of the new scene.|$|E

The clouds are in an inverted arc, much like the official die, but the rays of the glory extend down beyond the clouds and in back of the eagle. [...] Dupré added a UNITED STATES OF AMERICA legend around the sides, and a small rosette of leaves in the exergue below the eagle. For the reverse, Dupré apparently followed one of Jefferson's suggestions, depicting a scene of international commerce portrayed as Mercury (the god of diplomacy) in conference with the genius of America (shown as an Indian chief, similar to some early American copper coins).|$|E
2500|$|The Union College seal {{combines}} {{ancient and}} modern elements in balanced proportions. The head of the Roman goddess Minerva (Greek goddess Athena) appears {{in the center of}} an oval with an outside <b>star</b> <b>pattern</b> surrounding the whole.

[...] [...] On a banner just above the central figure are the words [...] "St: of N: York" [...] and on a similar banner below the central figure appear the words: [...] "Union College 1795". The precise origins of the motto and the choice of Minerva as the fundamental element of the College seal are obscure, but two things are certain: like most colleges of the time, Union was deeply rooted in the classical tradition, but, unlike most colleges, Union chose a modern language rather than Latin for its motto. The resulting tone of the entire seal is thus historically aware, but distinctly modern in outlook.|$|E
2500|$|An {{extremely}} rare group of carpets, [...] "chequerboard" [...] carpets were {{assumed to be}} a later and derivative continuum of the Mamluk and Ottoman Cairene group of carpets. Only about 30 of these carpets survived. They are distinguished by their design composed of rows of squares with triangles in each corner enclosing a <b>star</b> <b>pattern.</b> All [...] "chequerboard" [...] carpets have borders with cartouches and lobed medallions. Their attribution is still under debate. The colours and patterns resemble those seen in Mamluk carpets, however, they are [...] "S-spun" [...] and [...] "Z-twisted" [...] and thus similar to early anatolian and caucasian carpets. Since the early days of carpet science they are attributed to Damascus. Pinner and Franses champion this attribution because Syria was part first of the Mamluk, later of the Ottoman Empire at that time. This would explain the similarities with the colours and patterns of the Cairene carpets. The current dating of the chequerboard carpets is also consistent with European collection inventories from the early 17th century. Carpets of the [...] "chequerboard" [...] type are depicted on Pietro Paolinis (1603−1681) [...] "Self portrait", as well as on Gabriël Metsus painting [...] "The musical party".|$|E

2500|$|Another unusual Spanish {{example from}} the late 12th or early 13th century is {{the dome of the}} [...] in Torres Del Río, on the Way of St. James. The Way, a major pilgrimage route through {{northern}} Spain to the reputed burial place of St. James the Greater, attracted pilgrims from throughout Europe, especially after pilgrimage to Jerusalem was cut off. The difficulty of travel to Jerusalem for pilgrimage prompted some new churches to be built as a form of substitute, evoking the central plan and dome of Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre with their own variant. The dome in this case, however, is most evocative of the central mihrab dome of the Great Mosque of Cordoba. Over an octagonal room, the stone dome is formed by sixteen ribs, eight of which intersect with one another in a <b>star</b> <b>pattern</b> to define a smaller octagon {{at the center of the}} dome. This is one of a number of Christian crossed-arch dome examples in Spain and the south of France from the end of the 12th century, with patterns based upon the square or octagon. Other examples include the domes of San Miguel de Almazán, , and [...] Contemporary Islamic examples in Spain and North Africa are distinguished from the Christian by the use of thinner and more numerous arches, such as those of the Alcázar of Seville, the Villena Castle in Alicante, the Great Mosque of Taza, and the minaret of Koutoubia Mosque. The style experienced a revival in early 16th century Spain when one of the crossed-arch domes of the Great Mosque of Córdoba was used as the model for domes at Zaragoza, Teruel, and Tarazona.|$|E
