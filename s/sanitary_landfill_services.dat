The <b>landfill</b> that <b>serviced</b> Wonogiri {{is placed in}} Desa Kerjo Lor Kecamatan Ngadirojo Kabupaten Wonogiri with it area wide is 8, 2 hectare has been operated since 1992 with the open dumping method. Until now, Ngadirojo landfill leachate management {{does not have a}} safe for the environment, control of methane gas, and other bad effects polluting the environment. It is not in accordance with the Law of the Republic of Indonesia No. 18 Year 2008 on Waste Management which explained that the landfill must be processed and return the waste to the environment is safe for humans and the environment.

40|$|SUMMARY: Leachate {{generation}} and composition under monsoon conditions {{have been studied}} under ambient conditions by lysimeters. The settings of these lysimeters have been simulating <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfills</b> as well as dumpsites. The first period results over almost two years indicate that the open dump simulation showed highest leachate generation throughout rainy season and leachate flow terminating during the dry period. More than 60 % of the precipitation emerged as leachate; accordingly storage and evaporation accounted for {{less than half of}} the <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfills.</b> Moreover, the specific COD- and TKN load (kg/kg and year) discharged from dump site comprises 20 % and 180 % respectively more than that of <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfill</b> lysimeter. Type of waste material and kind of pre-treatment prior to landfilling greatly influence pollutant load. <b>Sanitary</b> <b>landfills</b> loaded with various wastes attained nearly similar leachate generation rates. Compared to <b>sanitary</b> <b>landfill</b> lysimeter filled with domestic the specific COD- and TKN load (kg/kg and year) discharged from composted waste accounted only for 4 % and 16 % respectively. 1.
