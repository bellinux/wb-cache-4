40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} is to {{show how}} information asymmetries among market participants affect the way they operate in the financial markets. The first chapter investigates deal initiation {{in the context of}} mergers and acquisitions. We use Securities Exchange Commission (<b>SEC)</b> <b>documents</b> of the merging firms in our sample to discover which side (acquirer or target) initiated the deal. Our analysis indicates that target firms receive substantially lower premiums when they initiate the merger: abnormal returns to target firm stocks around the merger announcement date are 12 percentage points lower in such deals. When premiums are calculated over a longer time period, this difference increases to 27 percentage points. We argue that the information asymmetries between merging firms is the primary reason for this finding. Alternative explanations, such as financial distress and liquidity hypotheses, are considered as well. Our findings also relate to acquirer returns, synergy gains from mergers, characteristics of firms involved in buyer- and seller-initiated deals and the effect of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on premium differences across initiation groups. The second chapter examines how information asymmetries within the set o...|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} {{depiction of}} the takeover market in the 1990 s is a non-competitive setting in which {{the management of the}} target firm negotiates with a single bidder.

We use our new data to test the wealth effects of the choice of auctions and negotiations by target management. Our consistent finding is that the wealth effects for target shareholders are comparable in auctions and negotiations. The results are consistent with models such as French and McCormick (1984) and Hansen (2001) which argue that the choice between an auction and a negotiation reflects a trade-off between competition and information costs. The results are inconsistent with agency cost models which argue that the choice of a negotiation reflects rent seeking by target management at the expense of target shareholders.

Finding solutions to mitigate the adverse effects of employee absenteeism on organizational profitability {{is critical to the}} success of organizations. The purpose of this case study was to explore the strategies human resource leaders used to mitigate the adverse effects of employee absenteeism on organizational profitability. The conceptual framework was performance prism theory. Data were gathered from in-depth interviews and publicly available organizational documents, including wellbeing program resources and annual investment presentations and Securities and Exchange Commission (<b>SEC)</b> reporting <b>documents.</b> Participants included 4 human resource managers and a third party service provider of an Atlanta, Georgia airline industry organization. The organization used in this case study was one of only twenty US companies, as of 2012, that implemented an absenteeism mitigation program at least 3 years prior to this study. The multi-year internal data collected, via interviews, from the human resource management of this 80, 000 employee international company specifically about absenteeism mitigation programs, provided a perspective not available from all firms. Data were transcribed, coded, and analyzed to generate emerging themes. Key themes included an emphasis on organizational culture, the wellbeing program, and the cost of absenteeism.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{predictability}} of the US-based international mutual fund returns by investigating 2, 479 daily observations for all categories of international equity, bond and hybrid mutual funds. Further, trading strategies are proposed and tested under different scenario including a proposed regulation by the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC). Design/methodology/approach – The sample is split and the initial sub sample is used to investigate return patterns of international funds and to develop trading rules based on the predictable return patterns. Trading rules are then tested on the holdout sample. Findings – Empirical results demonstrate statistically significant predictabilities. Various trading strategies show that the returns of both load and no-load funds are economically significant beating a buy-and-hold strategy. Empirical findings are consistent across the fund categories irrespective of sizes and styles. The tested strategies are profitable even with various limits on frequency of trading, minimum holding periods and even under a recent SEC's proposed regulation. Further, possible contracting and regulatory changes are proposed to improve the efficiency in the mutual fund industry. Originality/value – The results confirm previous findings of statistically and economically significant regularities from trading strategies that involve following the US markets. A test of <b>SEC's</b> proposed regulation <b>documents</b> that short-term investors may benefit from active trading strategy even if the SEC's rule is implemented.

50|$|In January 2009, Judge Scheindlin {{ruled in}} SEC v Collins & Aikman, a case which {{addresses}} discovery obligations of the Government in civil litigation.

2500|$|Aguirre {{represents}} Darcy Flynn, an SEC {{lawyer who}} {{also became a}} whistleblower after Robert Khuzami asked his staff in an e-mail on May 18, 2011 to report any questionable behavior {{on the part of}} lawyers representing clients. Though Khuzami had meant lawyers outside the SEC, Flynn reported activity that had taken place within the SEC. Early in Flynn's 13-year career at the SEC, he worked on a case where investigators thought they had clear evidence of fraud against Deutsche Bank. In an interview with Der Spiegel, CEO Rolf Breuer had denied the bank was involved in talks to acquire Bankers Trust, causing Bankers Trust stock to drop, which could lower the cost of a merger. SEC investigators began looking into the matter, collecting sworn testimony and documents that proved Breuer had lied. Deutsche Bank hired former SEC enforcement director Gary Lynch to persuade the SEC not to pursue the case, which had to be approved by superiors before proceeding. Approval to go forward with the case was approved by every level and lacked only the signature of Richard H. Walker, then serving as SEC enforcement director. Rather than approve the case, on July 10, 2001 he recused himself. On July 23, 2001, a letter was sent to Deutsche Bank informing them, [...] ""Inquiry in the above-captioned matter has been terminated." [...] The SEC dropped the fraud investigation without the customary explanation of its decision to close the case. On October 1, 2001, Walker was hired as general counsel by Deutsche Bank. In 2004, he hired Khuzami to work at the bank and a few years later, recommended him to become SEC enforcement director. Flynn was interviewed by staff from three congressional committees in summer 2011 on the Deutsche Bank case and the destruction of files from thousands of preliminary investigation cases conducted by the SEC. Senator Grassley wrote [...] a letter to the <b>SEC</b> about the <b>document</b> destruction and <b>SEC</b> inspector general H. David Kotz investigated the matter.|$|R
