25|$|To {{conserve}} over $2 {{billion annually}} in capital, the common stock and preferred stock dividends will be eliminated, but the common and all preferred <b>stocks</b> <b>will</b> remain outstanding. Subordinated debt interest and principal payments {{will continue to}} be made.|$|E
25|$|Once an asset's {{expected}} return, , {{is calculated}} using CAPM, the future cash flows of the asset can be discounted to their present value using this rate {{to establish the}} correct price for the asset. A riskier stock will have a higher beta and will be discounted at a higher rate; less sensitive <b>stocks</b> <b>will</b> have lower betas and be discounted at a lower rate. In theory, an asset is correctly priced when its observed price {{is the same as}} its value calculated using the CAPM derived discount rate. If the observed price is higher than the valuation, then the asset is overvalued; it is undervalued for a too low price.|$|E
2500|$|The {{new series}} utilises the format naa-naa {{starting}} from 1AA-1AA and was launched on 19 August 2013 using the slogan Vic – Stay Alert Stay Alive. The new format {{is estimated to}} last for 50 years. During the transitional period, Z-series <b>stocks</b> <b>will</b> still be available for motorists who lose or damage their plates, while the new series will be for general everyday issue. This combination with four separate sequences (one number, two letters, one number, two letters) {{is one of the}} most complex structure adopted for a vehicle registration plate around the world. It has also been suggested that the [...] "1" [...] at the front of the combination followed by two letters might be confused with [...] "I", for example, making 1CE look like ICE. Another issue with the new series is that the letter [...] "O" [...] and the number [...] "0" [...] are the same shape in the font used on Victorian plates, so the combination ending in [...] "4OW" [...] for example, is more likely to be read as [...] "40W". This mistake was less likely to be made on the older series as the letters and numbers were isolated by a separator.|$|E
50|$|The rolling <b>stock</b> <b>will</b> be the Citadis Dualis, Citadis' {{version of}} the tram-train, which is 2.65 m wide and 42 m long.

6000|$|... "On Tuesday," [...] he says, [...] "I supped, {{after the}} opera, at Mrs. Meynel's [...] {{with a set}} of the most fashionable company, which, take notice, I very [...] seldom do now, as I {{certainly}} am not of the age to mix often with [...] young people. Lady Melbourne was standing before the fire, and [...] adjusting her feathers in the glass. Says she, 'Lord, they say the [...] <b>stocks</b> <b>will</b> blow up! That will be very comical.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you know," [...] he said, [...] "that Bardsley, Littleson, Higgins, Phineas Duge, and myself, are {{the blood}} and the muscle of this country, so far as regards finance? Every {{one of the great}} {{railroad}} stocks is controlled by us. Prices are more or less what we make them. Three of the greatest industrial undertakings which the world has ever known, in which are invested hundreds of millions of honest American capital, are still controlled by us. If you publish that document, whatever the ultimate results may be, there will be the worst scare in the American money-market which the world has ever known. London and Paris were never so ill-prepared to come to the rescue, as a glance at the morning papers will show you. You will not find a city nor a village in this country, or a street, I almost was going to say a house, in New York, where {{there will not be a}} ruined man to curse you and your ill-considered action. The shrinkage in values in a few hours, of good and honest <b>stocks,</b> <b>will</b> come to twice as much as would pay for the Russo-Japanese war. I doubt whether this country would ever recover from the shock. That, Mr. Vine, is precisely what would happen if you adopt the methods of which you have just warned us." ...|$|E

5000|$|A third study {{investigated}} the role of portfolio building in a textual financial prediction system. From this study, Momentum and Contrarian stock portfolios were created and tested. Using the premise that past winning <b>stocks</b> <b>will</b> continue to win and past losing <b>stocks</b> <b>will</b> continue to lose, AZFinText netted a 20.79% return during the study period. It was also noted that traders were generally overreacting to news events, creating the opportunity of abnormal returns.|$|E

50|$|In {{financial}} markets, {{stock valuation}} is {{the method of}} calculating theoretical values of companies and their stocks. The main use of these methods is to predict future market prices, or more generally, potential market prices, and thus to profit from price movement - stocks that are judged undervalued (with respect to their theoretical value) are bought, while stocks that are judged overvalued are sold, in the expectation that undervalued <b>stocks</b> <b>will</b> overall rise in value, while overvalued <b>stocks</b> <b>will</b> generally decrease in value.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} {{performances}} mentioned are always {{relative to the}} overall market. During a bear market {{it is expected that}} all <b>stocks</b> <b>will</b> go down some.|$|E

Both first ones will be directed to the Colombian solidary sector, that is to say, the pension funds, cooperatives, workers and pensioned of Ecopetrol, territorial entities and the Colombians in general. The remaining <b>stocks</b> <b>will</b> be offered {{to the public and}} other companies. The Colombian Government will assure a budget of investment for the years 2007 and 2008 not lower than for 2006 (US$1.4 billion) fitted by the growth of the GDP.|$|E
5000|$|When a {{publicly}} traded company switches to a new CEO for any reason the <b>stock</b> on average <b>will</b> go down, but, the amount it goes down is affected by what gender the new CEO is among other factors. On average, when a male takes over as the role of CEO the <b>stock</b> <b>will</b> drop [...]5% while when a female becomes a CEO the <b>stock</b> <b>will</b> drop 5.7%. There is no explanation for this difference, {{but it can be}} assumed that gender does play a role in this large average difference.|$|R

5000|$|Typically, a stock {{obsolescence}} report {{uses the}} value of [...] "stock on hand" [...] as a starting point, and then reduces this value based on the potential that <b>stock</b> <b>will</b> be used up in the future. The higher the probability that <b>stock</b> <b>will</b> {{be used in the}} future, the more the on-hand stock value can be reduced. Sometimes a historical usage of the item can also reduce the value, in this case, the more recently the item was used, the more the on-hand value can be reduced.|$|R

50|$|To make money, {{the hedge}} fund must {{successfully}} predict which <b>stocks</b> <b>will</b> perform better.

This strategy is primarily implemented by hedge funds and sophisticated institutions.|$|E
