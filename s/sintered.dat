These new <b>sintering</b> methods, according to their authors, can be used for obtaining finer final microstructure of ceramics only by modifying the heating schedule. This work is focused on an influence of the Two Step <b>Sintering</b> method on the final microstructure for oxide ceramics. Obtained experimental results have shown that the effectivity of the Two Step <b>Sintering</b> method is rising with crystallographic symmetry of used material.

It could be pressed and <b>sintered</b> and stored in cans, but to be useful, it needed to be melted and cast. Casting presented difficulty because uranium corroded crucibles of beryllium, magnesia and graphite. To produce uranium metal, they tried reducing uranium oxide with hydrogen, but this did not work. While most of the neighboring elements on the periodic table can be reduced to form pure metal and slag, uranium did not behave this way. In June 1942 they then tried reducing the uranium with carbon in a hydrogen atmosphere, with only moderate success. They then tried aluminum, magnesium and calcium, all of which were unsuccessful. The following month the Ames team found that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container. Although graphite was known to react with uranium, this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched.|$|E
