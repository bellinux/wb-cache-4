These stories are knowledge of inhabitants’ daily lives {{and it may}} be useful for human-friendly agent. Story flows in daily lives are extracted from interaction between sensor room inhabitants and a <b>symbiotic</b> <b>agent.</b> The agent asks causal relationships among daily events for inhabitants to create the story flow. Experimental results show that created stories let created stories perceive agent’s intelligence...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of our own researches of therapeutic and preventive effectiveness of symbiotic drug Colifagina PRO against the background of antibacterial therapy in children with respiratory diseases. The need to correct dysbiotic violations using antibiotic therapy is not in doubt. Inclusion in the combination therapy with antibiotics of probiotic correction with <b>symbiotic</b> <b>agent</b> Colifagina PRO in patients with acute respiratory disorders enabled to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children and contributed to a more rapid regression of the main symptoms of the disease, normalization of stool nature and frequency...|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} of microcystin-LR (MCYST-LR) -induced lung inflammation {{has never been}} reported Hence. LASSBio 596, an anti-Inflammatory drug candidate, designed as <b>symbiotic</b> <b>agent</b> that modulates TNF-alpha levels and inhibits phosphodiesterase types 4 and 5, or dexamethasone were tested in this condition Swiss mice were intraperitoneally (i p) injected with 60 mu l of saline (CTRL) or a sub-lethal dose of MCYST-LR (40 mu g/kg). 6 h later they were treated (i p.) with saline (TOX), LASSB 10 596 (10 mg/kg, L 596), or dexamethasone (1 mg/kg, 0. 1 mL, DEXA). 8 h after MCYST-LR injection, pulmonary mechanics were determined, and lungs and livers prepared for histopathology, biochemical analysis and quantification of MCYST-LR. TOX showed significantly higher lung impedance than CTRL and L 596, which were similar. DEXA could only partially block the mechanical alterations. In both TOX and DEXA alveolar collapse and inflammatory cell influx were higher than in CTRL and L 596, being LASSB 10 596 more effective than dexamethasone. TOX showed oxidative stress that was not present in an and L 596, while DEXA was partially efficient. MCYST-LR was detected in the livers of all mice receiving MCYST-LR and no recovery was apparent In conclusion, LASSBio 596 was more efficient than dexamethasone in reducing the pulmonary functional impairment induced by MCYST-LR.

50|$|In medicine, the hygiene {{hypothesis}} is a hypothesis that states {{a lack of}} early childhood exposure to infectious <b>agents,</b> <b>symbiotic</b> microorganisms (such as the gut flora or probiotics), and parasites increases susceptibility to allergic diseases by suppressing the natural development of the immune system. In particular, the lack of exposure is thought to lead to defects {{in the establishment of}} immune tolerance.|$|R
2500|$|Secondary {{metabolites}} have a {{broad range}} of functions. [...] These include pheromones that act as social signaling molecules with other individuals of the same species, communication molecules that attract and activate <b>symbiotic</b> organisms, <b>agents</b> that solubilize and transport nutrients (siderophores etc.), and competitive weapons (repellants, venoms, toxins etc.) that are used against competitors, prey, and predators. For many other secondary metabolites, the function is unknown. One hypothesis is that they confer a competitive advantage to the organism that produces them. An alternative view is that, in analogy to the immune system, these secondary metabolites have no specific function, but having the machinery in place to produce these diverse chemical structures is important and a few secondary metabolites are therefore produced and selected for.|$|R
40|$|A {{recent survey}} on the {{microflora}} {{associated with the}} leafhopper Scaphoideus titanus Ball (Hemiptera Cicadellidae), the vector of “flavescence dorée” (FD), showed the presence of bacteria belonging to the genus Asaia. These bacteria are symbionts of insects of the genus Anopheles, malarial mosquito vectors. We focused on the association between Asaia sp. and S. titanus with the aim to evaluate a possible role of this microorganism as a <b>symbiotic</b> control <b>agent.</b> After development of artificial feeding systems for S. titanus, quantitative PCR on insects or feeds DNA was performed with specific primers. Results underlined that Asaia sp. was dominant in the insect microflora. A strain of Asaia expressing a green fluorescent protein was used to perform recolonization {{of the body of}} S. titanus, showing the colonization by the bacterium of salivary glands, guts, female and male reproductive organs of the insect. In situ hybridization with specific probes was performed on insect dissections, confirming the presence of the bacterium in spermatic bundles and in Malpighian tubules. Easy cultivability, dominance within the bacterial population in the insect body, cryogenic preservability and easiness for genetic manipulation demonstrated by the overall data make Asaia sp. an optimal candidate for carrying factors for FD control...|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{explanation is}} that the developing immune system must receive stimuli (from infectious <b>agents,</b> <b>symbiotic</b> bacteria, or parasites) to adequately develop regulatory T cells. Without that stimuli it becomes more susceptible to autoimmune diseases and allergic diseases, because of insufficiently repressed TH1 and TH2 responses, respectively. For example, all chronic inflammatory disorders show evidence of failed immunoregulation. Secondly, helminths, non-pathogenic ambient pseudocommensal bacteria or certain gut commensals and probiotics, drive immunoregulation. They block or treat models of all chronic inflammatory conditions. Thirdly, some such organisms (or molecules that they secrete), specifically expand populations of regulatory T cells (Treg), or cause dendritic cells to switch to regulatory forms that preferentially drive immunoregulation. Finally, when multiple sclerosis patients become infected with helminths, the disease stops progressing and circulating myelin-recognising regulatory T cells appear in the peripheral blood. This indicates that helminths act as adjuvants for regulatory T cells. This observation led to clinical trials.|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. (Information Technology) The {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} look at artificial intelligence techniques that have been embedded into computer games, which is then referred to as either game agents or non-player character agents (NPC-agent). This dissertation focuses on the design and creation of an agent that utilises the concept of symbiosis for controlling a non-player character (NPC). The dissertation considers what agents are, and what their connection to computer games is. The aspect of cloud computing was considered as it provides {{a new avenue for}} additional resources to be obtained for agents in computer games. To understand how this can be achieved cloud computing is investigated to provide a basic understanding of cloud computing as a whole. The next stage was to consider the essential components in a game agent, which are navigation, decision-making, and perception. The components are then discussed along with the techniques that they have utilised. Once the research was completed, the model was designed with the aid of symbiosis to create a <b>symbiotic</b> game <b>agent</b> (SGA). The SGA is created by breaking down the vital components of a game agent into separate symbiont agents that have the sole purpose of fulfilling one set of responsibilities, for example, a symbiont agent is responsible for all perception activity in connection to the NPC. To allow access to the resources to be obtained from cloud computing, service orientation and a service agent are introduced into the design. The last stage of the dissertation is the creation of a prototype SGA to provide proof of the concept of the model. Within the prototype, the SGA was implemented along with the implemented navigation symbiont agent, using a service agent. Results of the implementation are presented, highlighting the use of each of the symbiont agents in the SGA while they direct the NPC in the prototype computer game environment...|$|R
40|$|Animals {{frequently}} use metabolites {{produced by}} <b>symbiotic</b> bacteria as <b>agents</b> against pathogens and parasites. Secretions from the preen gland of birds {{are used for}} this purpose, although its chemicals apparently are produced by the birds themselves. European hoopoes Upupa epops and green woodhoopoes Phoeniculus purpureus harbour symbiotic bacteria in the uropygial gland that might be {{partly responsible for the}} chemical composition of secretions. Here we investigate the antimicrobial activity of the volatile fraction of chemicals in hoopoe preen secretions, and, by means of experimental antibiotic injections, test whether symbiotic bacteria living within the uropygial gland are responsible for their production. Hoopoes produce two different kinds of secretions that differ drastically in their chemical composition. While the malodorous dark secretions produced by nestlings included a complex mix of volatiles, these chemicals did not appear in white secretions produced by non-nesting birds. All volatiles detected showed strong antibacterial activity, and a mixture of the chemicals at the concentrations measured in nestling glands inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains assayed. We found support for the hypothesized role of bacteria in the production of such antimicrobial chemicals because experimental clearance of bacteria from glands of nestlings with antibiotics resulted in secretions without most of the volatiles detected in control individuals. Thus, the presence of symbiotic bacteria in the uropygial gland provides hoopoes with potent antimicrobials for topical use...|$|R
