Moisture occurred along a north-south gradient with the south receiving the most cloud cover and moisture due to the airflow from the North Pacific.

In this Beringian refugium, eastern Beringia's vegetation included isolated pockets of larch and spruce forests with birch and alder trees. This environment supported large herbivores that were prey for Beringian wolves and their competitors.

40|$|Abstract—We examine bit- and symbol-interleaving {{strategies}} for linear nonbinary block codes (under bounded-distance decoding) {{over the family}} of binary additive noise finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) models with memory. We derive a simple analytical sufficient condition under which perfect (i. e., with infinite interleaving depth) symbol interleaving outperforms perfect bit interleaving {{in terms of the}} probability of codeword error (PCE). It is shown that the well-known Gilbert–Elliott channel (GEC) with positive noise-correlation coefficient and the recently introduced Markovian queue-based channel (QBC) of memory M satisfy this condition. This result has widely been illustrated numerically (without proof) in the literature, particularly for the GEC. We also provide examples of binary FSMC models for which the reverse result holds, i. e., perfect bit interleaving outperforming perfect symbol interleaving. Finally, a numerical PCE study of imperfect symbol-interleaved nonbinary codes over the QBC indicates that there is a linear relationship between the optimal interleaving depth and a function of a single parameter of the QBC.
