5|$|Grissom's {{spacecraft}} {{was recovered}} in 1999, but no further evidence was found which could conclusively {{explain how the}} explosive hatch release had occurred. Later, Guenter Wendt, pad leader for the early American manned space launches, wrote that he believed a small cover over the external release actuator was accidentally lost sometime during the flight or <b>splashdown,</b> and the T-handle may have been tugged by a stray parachute suspension line, or was perhaps damaged by the heat of re-entry and, after cooling upon <b>splashdown,</b> contracted and fired.|$|E
5|$|Some {{biologists}} {{were concerned}} about the mutant fungi being a major microbiological hazard for humans, and reaching Earth in the <b>splashdown,</b> after having been in an isolated environment for 15 years.|$|E
5|$|After {{speeding}} {{through the}} atmosphere, the capsule lands in a lake, but dense smoke forces Stone to evacuate immediately after <b>splashdown.</b> She opens the capsule hatch, allowing water {{to enter and}} sink it, forcing her to shed her spacesuit and swim ashore. After watching {{the remains of the}} Tiangong re-enter the atmosphere, Stone shakily takes her first steps back on land.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{was handled}} by RCS, a German {{construction}} company. Beginning with the <b>splashdown</b> area, construction later progressed into the Immelman loop and station areas. In late January 2011, the final piece of track (top {{of the first}} drop) was installed. After testing and a ribbon cutting ceremony, Krake opened on April 16, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Storm Coaster is a Water Coaster {{located at}} the Sea World theme park on the Gold Coast, Australia. The ride is {{designed}} by German firm Mack Rides and combines the flume and <b>splashdown</b> elements of a log flume, with the chain lift hill and drops of a steel roller coaster.|$|E
5|$|Water brakes {{were first}} {{introduced}} on SheiKra at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in 2005. Water brakes {{can only be}} used when a <b>splashdown</b> element, in which {{a body of water}} surrounds a section of track, is present within the layout of the roller coaster. When scoops on the last car of each train come in contact with the surrounding water, the train slows down and the water is sprayed several feet into the air behind it.|$|E

50|$|The Canadian Arrow is a 16.5 m tall {{two-stage}} rocket, {{where the}} second stage is a three-person space capsule. In a somewhat conservative approach, {{the design of the}} rocket engine and aerodynamics are based on the well proven V-2 design from WWII. The vehicle will launch vertically from the ground, on a sub-orbital trajectory, and will return to Earth via parachutes and make a water landing, similar to the <b>splashdowns</b> of the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo spacecraft.|$|R
5|$|On July 21, 1961, Grissom was {{pilot of}} the second Project Mercury flight, Mercury-Redstone 4, which he named Liberty Bell 7. This was a sub-orbital flight that lasted 15 minutes and 37 seconds. After <b>splashdown,</b> {{emergency}} explosive bolts unexpectedly fired and blew the hatch off, causing water to flood into the spacecraft. Quickly exiting through the open hatch and into the ocean, Grissom nearly drowned as water began filling his spacesuit. A recovery helicopter tried to lift and retrieve the spacecraft, but the flooding spacecraft became too heavy, and it was ultimately cut loose before sinking.|$|E
5|$|Rumors {{of a new}} {{roller coaster}} being built at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay began to {{circulate}} after a roller coaster enthusiast emailed the park and received a response saying that a roller coaster would be built. These rumors stated that the roller coaster would include a <b>splashdown</b> and an inversion on Bolliger & Mabillard's Dive Coaster, both a first for its kind. Later in the season, the park began to remove part of the track of Serengeti Express. On April 26, 2004, construction permits were discovered that confirmed that a roller coaster, restaurant, and gift shop would be constructed.|$|E
5|$|WhiteWater World {{operates}} three dining {{outlets in}} the peak holiday seasons: Bite Me Cafe, Sandman's Cafe and Bar and Salty's Kiosk. The widest range of meals {{is available from}} the Bite Me Cafe which operates all year round. Sandman's Cafe and Bar is a licensed bar where guests can purchase alcoholic drinks and food options including Eagle Boys pizza. It is located on the park's western border between the Cave of Waves and the <b>splashdown</b> of The Wedgie. Salty's Kiosk is located next to The BRO and sells slushies, ice creams and other snack foods.|$|E
5|$|Several {{missions}} were {{proposed to}} demonstrate methods of landing the Gemini spacecraft on land. The spacecraft {{had originally been}} designed to land using a paraglider {{and a set of}} skis or wheels, however this was abandoned in favor of <b>splashdowns</b> under parachutes due to delays in development and failures during testing. As the proposed Big Gemini spacecraft would have landed this way, McDonnell Aircraft asked NASA to consider flying standard Gemini spacecraft with the paraglider in order to test the system before it would be required operationally.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{designed}} {{to land on}} solid ground, {{like that of the}} early and current Soviet and Russian manned spacecraft (Vostok, Voskhod, and Soyuz), with a water landing as a backup, in August 2007, NASA tentatively redesigned the Orion for water landings (<b>splashdowns)</b> as the primary mode of landing, with ground landings as the emergency backup http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/Airbag061908.xml&headline=Orion%20Landing%20Airbag%20In%20Works&channel=space. Under the advice of the Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) report, NASA will most likely develop abort procedures that resemble the abort procedures used on Apollo, but with some procedures carried over from the Shuttle.|$|R
40|$|On 14 January 2005 the Huygens {{space probe}} landed on Titan, {{the surface of}} which had {{previously}} been obscured by smog. This exercise was undertaken prior to the probe’s successful landing, {{in an attempt to}} calculate the sounds which would be associated with <b>splashdowns</b> and methane-falls, in the hypothetical scenario that (of the many sensing systems on Huygens) only the acoustic information was available in order to interpret conditions on Titan. The exercise includes innovations in the inversion of bubble entrainment noise to estimate bubble populations, and illustrates the benefits of using acoustics for space exploration...|$|R
5|$|According to Walter Bolliger, {{development}} of the Dive Coaster began between 1994 and 1995. On March 14, 1998, the world's first Dive Coaster, Oblivion, opened at Alton Towers. Though Oblivion is classified as a Dive Coaster, {{it does not have}} a true vertical drop as the drop angle is 87-degrees. Two years later, the second Dive Coaster built, Diving Machine G5, opened at Janfusun Fancyworld and also does not have a vertical drop. In 2005, SheiKra opened at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and was the first Dive Coaster to feature a 90-degree drop and a <b>splashdown</b> element. In 2007, Busch Gardens Williamsburg announced that Griffon would be the first ever Dive Coaster to feature floorless trains and SheiKra would have its trains replaced with floorless ones. In 2011, the first 'mini' Dive Coaster opened at Heide Park Resort, named Krake. Unlike other Dive Coasters, Krake has smaller trains consisting of three rows of six riders.|$|E

[...] It was Fedotovo's first unit, {{beginning}} {{operations in}} 1963 and serving active duty with the Northern Fleet Air Arm and tasked with monitoring {{the activities of}} Western navies in the Arctic, participating in space program <b>splashdowns,</b> and conducting search-and-rescue activities. [...] Its aircraft were deployed regularly to Cuba throughout the 1970s and to Angola and Guinea later in the decade. [...] A declassified CIA document written in 1977 took note of these Atlantic deployments, stating that while they had little impact on the United States mainland, they [...] "contribute to the threat to Western naval forces operating in the Northern Atlantic Ocean".|$|R
2500|$|Surf Hill: This ride, {{common to}} other water parks at the time, allowed patrons to slide down a water-slick sloped surface on mats into small puddles, {{until they reached}} a foam barrier after an upslope at the end. Barriers between lanes were minimal, and people {{frequently}} collided with {{each other on the}} way down, or at the end. The seventh lane was known as the [...] "back breaker", due to its special kicker two-thirds of the way down intended to allow jumps and <b>splashdowns</b> into a larger puddle. Employees at the park used to like eating at a nearby snack bar with {{a good view of the}} attraction, since it was almost guaranteed that they could see some serious injuries, lost bikini tops, or both. Mountain Creek kept this attraction open through 2005, then reopened it in 2012.|$|R
40|$|Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) water <b>splashdowns</b> were {{simulated}} {{in order}} to find maximum acceleration loads on the astronauts and spacecraft under various landing conditions. The acceleration loads were used in a Dynamic Risk Index (DRI) program to find the potential risk for injury posed on the astronauts for a range of landing conditions. The DRI results showed that greater risks for injury occurred for two landing conditions; when the vertical velocity was large and the contact angle between the spacecraft and the water impact surface was zero, and when the spacecraft was in a toe down configuration and both the vertical and horizontal landing velocities were large. Rollover was also predicted to occur for cases where there is high horizontal velocity and low contact angles in a toe up configuration, and cases where there was a high horizontal velocity with high contact angles in a toe down configuration...|$|R

40|$|The {{threat of}} tsunamis and tsunami-like waves hitting the eastern United States {{is very real}} despite a general {{impression}} to the contrary. We have cataloged 40 tsunamis and tsunami-like waves {{that have occurred in}} the eastern United States since 1600. Tsunamis were generated from such events as the 1755 Queen Anne’s earthquake, the Grand Banks event of 1929, the Charleston earthquake of 1886, and the New Madrid earthquakes of 1811 - 1812. The Queen Anne tsunami was observed as far away as St. Martin in the West Indies and is the only known teletsunami generated in this source region. Since subduction zones are absent around most of the Atlantic basin, tsunamis and tsunami-like waves along the United States East Coast are not generated from this traditional source, but appear, in most cases {{to be the result of}} slumping or landsliding associated with local earthquakes or with wave action associated with strong storms. Other sources of tsunamis and tsunami-like waves along the eastern seaboard have recently come to light including volcanic debris falls or catastrophic failure of volcanic slopes; explosive decompression of underwater methane deposits or oceanic meteor <b>splashdowns.</b> These sources are considered as well...|$|R
50|$|On March 15, 1951, the National Ensign was hoisted, re-commissioning {{the station}} as a Naval Air Facility. The station {{soon became a}} beehive of activity, as it was slated to become a Master Jet Base. New {{construction}} around the base was begun which included dual 8,000-foot runways, and new facilities to replace the temporary structures of World War II, including a modern operations tower capable of handling all the complex flights of a full-scale Naval Air Station. Two outlying fields were also planned to be built, one for gunnery and one for carrier practice landings. On June 15, 1950, North Korea on Chinese authorization crossed the 38th parallel and invaded their neighbors in South Korea. Acting quickly and on little notice, the American military reversed the post-World War II trend of reduction-in-forces and several subordinate commands stationed at NAS Brunswick were re-commissioned. While not directly involved in combat operations in Korea, its squadrons contributed {{to the war effort}} by assuming the many responsibilities of commands who had been deployed to the Pacific. In 1959, NAS Brunswick’s primary mission was support of Fleet Air Wing Three which was composed of Patrol Squadrons Seven, Ten, Eleven, Twenty One, Twenty Three, and Twenty Six. Flying the P2V Neptune and PB4Y-2 Privateer, the squadrons played a major part in the defense of the North Atlantic area, tracking Soviet submarines around the clock throughout the Cold War. In 1962, NAS Brunswick and Fleet Air Wing Five began the transition to the P-3A Orion marking {{the beginning of a new}} era in Naval Patrol Aviation. During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 and more encompassing, during the entirety of the Cold War between American and Soviet forces, both the P2V and P-3A became nationally well-known due to their surveillance of Soviet ships in the Atlantic Ocean, leading to a safe resolution. Fleet Air Wing Five aircraft also played an important part in America’s early manned space programs in 1965 and 1966, helping to locate Mercury and Gemini capsules after <b>splashdowns.</b> In 1966, Wing Five began deployments in the Western Pacific. Based at Naval Station Sangley Point in the Philippines, squadrons flew patrol and combat missions in support of Seventh Fleet operations in South East Asia throughout the years of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. On August 2 of 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein launched an invasion on the neighboring country of Kuwait. In response, the United States launched a wholly defensive mission to the Middle East named Operation Desert Shield. Patrol Squadron Twenty Three was the first East Coast maritime patrol squadron in-theater for Operation Desert Shield, providing maritime surveillance throughout the Red Sea. Patrol Squadron EIGHT participated in joint operations during Desert Storm, flying combat sorties in the effort to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi forces.|$|R
25|$|Once {{the task}} was completed, the Orion {{spacecraft}} would then depart from the asteroid and, upon reaching the vicinity of Earth, would jettison both the service module and the landing module {{in a manner similar}} to that of Apollo 13 before entering the atmosphere for a Pacific Ocean <b>splashdown.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bullet {{holes on}} 79001 {{showed that the}} DC-3 was shot down by a MiG-15bis fighter. The exact <b>splashdown</b> time was also determined, {{as one of the}} clocks in the cockpit had stopped at 11:28:40 CET.

25|$|On 25 August 1966, {{she was on}} {{recovery}} {{station for}} the flight of AS-202, the second unmanned flight of a production Apollo Command and Service Module. The moonship rocketed three-quarters of {{the way around the}} globe in 93 minutes before <b>splashdown</b> near Wake Island. Scorched from the heat of its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, the Apollo space capsule, designed to carry American astronauts to the moon, was brought aboard Hornet after its test; that command module is currently on display aboard Hornet.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{existing}} procedures, {{he ordered the}} instrumentation system, which included telemetry, visibility, and the transmitters for communications, to be turned on last, just before reentry, rather than first. The call was a calculated risk. Without the instrumentation system, the crew and controllers would not know for certain if the cold startup had been successful until the last possible moment before reentry. However without the change, the capsule would have exhausted its battery supply before <b>splashdown.</b> The procedure was a success, and the crew was recovered safely.|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} of Falcon 9 Flight 6 {{performed}} the first test of a controlled descent and propulsive landing over water on 29 September 2013. Although not a complete success, the stage was able to change direction and make a controlled entry into the atmosphere. During the final landing burn, the ACS thrusters could not overcome an aerodynamically induced spin, and centrifugal force deprived the landing engine of fuel leading to early engine shutdown and a hard <b>splashdown</b> which destroyed the first stage. Pieces of wreckage were recovered for further study.|$|E
25|$|North American Rockwell Block 1 Apollo Command Module, serial 007, a Block 1 spacecraft, {{built for}} {{training}} and Earth-orbit missions, delivered to NASA in 1966 (and originally identical to CM 012 in which astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee died in the 1967 launchpad fire), after serving as a ground test vehicle was modified in 1967 for use in water-survival training. As part of their training, astronauts inside the capsule were dropped into the Gulf of Mexico by a crane from an aircraft carrier to simulate the force of <b>splashdown.</b> Apollo crews also trained for extended recovery by remaining at sea for several {{days at a time}} in the Command Module. This prepared astronauts for the possibility of a <b>splashdown</b> far from the planned recovery site. In 1971, CM 007 was transported to Eglin Air Force Base, where it was exposed to cold water and cold air during testing through 1973 for the forthcoming Skylab program. It was displayed at several open houses during this period at the base. The Command Module survived the tests only to end up in an equipment lot of the Houston Department of Public Works, where it remained for 12 years. In 1988, CM 007 was restored for the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington, where it is now preserved, by the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center.|$|E
25|$|During reentry, {{there was}} a great deal of concern over whether Carpenter had {{actually}} survived, since he splashed down 250 miles off course. There are two accounts of the Aurora 7 recovery, the first being that forty minutes after <b>splashdown,</b> Carpenter was located in his life raft, safe and in good health by Maj. Fred Brown under the command of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard, and recovered three hours later by the , and the second being that a P-2 Neptune from Patrol Squadron 18 flying out of Naval Station Roosevelt Roads was the first to sight and mark Carpenter's position.|$|E
