25|$|By 1940, Canada’s {{healthcare}} system {{had undergone a}} fundamental overhaul. At {{the beginning of the}} war Canadian military began to actively recruit women into <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> previously dominated by men. Military administrators looked to find new ways to radically increase the available pool of trained nurses. In an effort to keep nursing a predominantly female industry and an attractive occupational option, propaganda to recruit women into the war effort forced nurses to abandon the long-held Victorian ideal of femininity. Tailored shirts, short sleeves, and relaxed necklines all assisted in the development in a new era of nursing personnel.|$|E

50|$|The 1881 census was {{the first}} census to become more {{specific}} with occupation data; it classifies information from 9 categories to 24. The pie chart depicts the top five male occupations in Pennington in 1881. The census information shows that the largest <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> for males at this time was in 'various mineral substances' which is essentially mining. The second largest <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> came from the Agriculture industry.|$|R
50|$|The {{industry}} sector has changed somewhat in Britain since 1881, with {{the decrease in}} primary sector employment such as mining {{and the increase in}} secondary and more recently tertiary <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b> This can be seen when specifically looking at Pennington when looking at the 2011 Census data. The largest <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> for males currently is the manufacturing industry with 126 men employed. As the gender balance has evened over time there are also many more females employed in 2011 compared to 1881 in Pennington. The largest <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> for females in Pennington is now in the human health and social work activities industry with 113 women working in this sector, according to key statistics from the 2011 census.|$|R
25|$|In fact, {{each city}} {{has a couple of}} {{distinct}} advantages that the other city lacks—Sudbury is at the centre of a larger economic sphere due to the city's, and Northeastern Ontario's, larger population, but Thunder Bay is advantaged by air, rail and shipping traffic due to its prime location along major continental transportation routes. The Thunder Bay International Airport is the third busiest airport in Ontario after Toronto Pearson International Airport and Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport, carrying some 600,000 passengers in 2004 with over 100 flights and four international flights daily. Sudbury's economy, in which the largest <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> are government-related fields such as education and health care, is somewhat more diversified than Thunder Bay's, which is still based primarily on natural resources and manufacturing. Yet in the era of government cutbacks, Thunder Bay's economy has been less prone to recession and unemployment.|$|E

Their numbers fluctuated greatly (regular employees went from 13,200 in 1950 to 15,000 in 1951, to as little as 7,000 in early 1952, and again to 12,500 later in that year). At the same time, facilities meant to accommodate the projected influx of labor (including homes available on credit) were never actually completed. This was overlooked by the propaganda machine, which instead furnished Stakhanovite stories, according to which work quotas were surpassed by as much as 170%. Authorities also made the claim that the construction site was offering training to previously unskilled workers (as many as 10,000 in one official communiqué).|$|E

50|$|The data {{included}} in the graph shows that in 1881 there was one <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> that was significantly more popular than any others. This sector was the agriculture sector which had a total of 81 people working in.|$|R
30|$|Our {{hypothesis}} is that the <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> matters significantly for rural wages. In particular, the rural population relies heavily on agriculture for employment {{and that may be}} responsible for the rural-non-rural wage gap. As the economy grows, reliance on agriculture as a <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> diminishes overtime; hence, one would expect a convergence of wages in the two areas (Hnatkovska and Lahiri 2013). Rural areas also depend more heavily on employment in Israel (where wages are higher), but the importance of this source of disparity has been diminishing overtime due to restriction on labor mobility by Israel. This may favor the wage convergence hypothesis which states that rural and non-rural wages will tend to converge as the agricultural share <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> gets smaller and access to the Israeli labor market becomes more restricted.|$|R
