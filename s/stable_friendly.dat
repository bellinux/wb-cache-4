We aimed to examine whether this 3 -components structure can describe social relationships and to investigate the degree of asymmetry of social relationships. We used the Japanese macaque as our model species, as group members may form strong social relationships with one another. We collected 359. 2 h of focal samples, on 21 monkeys, and ran a principal component analysis (PCA) on dyadic scores for 9 variables measuring social relationships, e. g., grooming or aggression. This PCA gave 3 components. However, a second PCA run on scores per individual, i. e. for each variable and dyad we obtained 1 score for the actor and 1 for the receiver of behavior, gave a 5 -component structure. We interpreted this result as evidence of the asymmetric nature of social relationships, in terms of the frequency and type of behavior exchanged between social partners, in the Japanese macaque. This interpretation was confirmed by the low correlation coefficients between behaviors given and received within a dyad. Overall these results provide mixed support for the 3 -components structure predicted by Cords and Aureli (2000). They also show that social relationships may be largely asymmetric and that this asymmetry should be considered in studies on social behavior...|$|E

Especially nanogold and nanosilver have been of particular interest in spectroscopic analyses because of their intense visible-region absorption, which is largely attributed to the surface plasmon resonance. Compared to nanogold, nanosilver has the advantages of a low-cost, higher molar extinction coefficient [5] and stronger surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effects [6]. Moreover, nanosilver has a very broad range of antimicrobial activity [7] and represents a new generation of antimicrobials. The properties of metal nanoparticles depend strongly on the nanoparticles’ size and shape [8, 9]. Several methods have been developed for synthesizing nanosilver in a variety of shapes, including triangle, cube, rod, and wire [10 – 14]. But, most of the methods need high-concentration surfactants as stabilizer that restrains SERS effect and pollutes the environment.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to detect how Value for Money (VfM) in Italian Project Finance (PF) {{investments}} can be enhanced and challenging criticalities minimized, with a synergistic interaction of macroeconomic, legal and institutional actions. Design/methodology/approach – Analysis of VfM quantitative key drivers, within a public-private partnership (PPP) framework with specific reference to a recession context, with infrastructural capital rationing implications. Empirical evidence is given by an Italian PF healthcare model, testing the impact of legal and macroeconomic changes. Findings – Deleverage, ignited by W-shaped recession, disinflates PPP investments, so forcing to innovative and penniless solutions. Unreliable and short-sighted legislation and consequent unfriendly business climate may frighten investors, so decreasing competition and VfM. Research limitations/implications – VfM sensitivity to macroeconomic and legal/institutional parameters is too wide and capriciously erratic to be comprehensively modeled. Tips for further research include pro-growth tax and budgetary policies, risk minimization issues and other synergistic targets. Practical implications – Guidance to regulators to fine tune legal and institutional tools, so as to create a <b>stable,</b> business <b>friendly</b> environment. Recessions may be softened by sensitive policymaking, or exacerbated by short-sighted ignorance and lack of strategic focus.

This was also fuelled by factors like religious fundamentalism and ethno-nationalist chauvinism. The newly independent countries of the Central Asian region encountered myriad problems like terrorism, drug trafficking, arms trafficking, organized crime, separatism, and ethnic conflicts. Given the geographical proximity and historicity, Central Asia is regarded as Russia’s own backyard and a “soft underbelly”. The near-abroad security developments in the Central Asian republics have great influence on Russia and could create a complex environment detrimental to its security interests. The Russian approach to this challenge is of great importance for the stability of the whole area.

Exposure to humid environments at temperatures 20 C and 30 C for CB 10 TSS and Albipox and 50 C for Timberset resulted in water uptake characterized as Fickian which had only a modest effect on properties. However, exposure to humid environments at temperature (50 C) which is higher than Tg resulted in non-Fickian uptake of water for CB 10 TSS and Albipox and a more adverse effect on properties...|$|R

However experimental attempts to stabilize Sn 2 + on the A-site of perovskite ATiO 3 have so far failed. In this work, we report on the growth of atomically smooth, epitaxial, and coherent Sn-alloyed SrTiO 3 films on SrTiO 3 (001) substrates using a hybrid molecular beam epitaxy approach. With increasing Sn concentration, the out-of-plane lattice parameter first increases in accordance with the Vegard’s law and then decreases for Sn(Sr+Ti+Sn) at. % ratio > 0. 1 due to the incorporation of Sn 2 + at the A-site. Using a combination of high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional calculations, we show that while majority of Sn is on the B-site, there is a quantitatively unknown fraction of Sn being consistent with the A-site occupancy making SrTiO 3 polar. A relaxor-like ferroelectric local distortion with monoclinic symmetry, induced by A-site Sn 2 +, was observed in Sn-doped SrTiO 3 with Sn(Sr+Ti+Sn) at. % ratio = 0. 1 using optical second harmonic generation measurements.

The physico chemical properties of the biodiesel/petro diesel blends were determined. The properties are specific gravity, viscosity, flash point, calorific value, sulphur content, copper strip corrosion, colour, diesel index, cetane number, and cloud point. It was observed that, 9 out of the 10 properties determined conform to ASTM standards except for the colour which was dark brown for the oil and biodiesel, and brown for the automotive gasoline oil. The specific gravity and viscosity increase with percentage increase of biodiesel in the blends. The sulphur content, calorific values, cetane number and diesel index decrease with increase in the percentage biodiesel from the blends.

40|$|The 'common sense' view of Australian {{foreign policy}} in the South Pacific is that it is aimed at {{securing}} a <b>stable</b> and <b>friendly</b> near neighbourhood for Australia. Contrary to this view, this thesis argues that Australian {{foreign policy in}} the South Pacific is based upon an ideology of institutional neo-liberalism and is therefore mostly concerned with transforming governance structures within and around states in line with neo-liberal models of statehood. The Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) is an Australian-led intervention and state-building initiative designed in response to the violence experienced in the Solomon Islands from 1998 to 2001 and the following years of state bankruptcy and criminality that plagued the South Pacific state. RAMSI has been commonly represented as a success story of international interventionism and state-building, however, I will argue that this representation is seriously flawed because of fundamental oversights in two key aspects of the intervention, caused by RAMSI’s ideological underpinnings. Firstly, causes of instability and violence in the Solomon Islands are reduced to ethnic conflict, poor governance and slow economic growth, while political and historical causes are ignored or seen as secondary. Therefore the central 'solutions' to the 'failure' of the state revolve around the implementation of 'good governance' and private sector led economic growth, whilst long standing grievances are ignored. Secondly, RAMSI is replicating, or even exacerbating, many of the same political-economic conditions that led to the violent conflict to which it is responding. The implications of this argument are that Australian {{foreign policy in the}} South Pacific is actually undermining its stated objective of promoting stability...|$|R

From the standpoint of green chemistry, the investigation of simple, low cost, <b>stable,</b> environmentally <b>friendly,</b> and potentially active materials for complete oxidation reactions at low temperatures is highly desirable. In recent years, green chemical approaches have become an integrated part of daily life and implementation of this modern discipline led to momentous ecological benefits, innovations and a strengthened economy.

The first part of this thesis will discuss the importance of catalytic oxidation reactions, synthesis, and characterization of the mesoporous manganese oxide materials and their applications in a series of complete oxidation reactions. The projected decline in fossil fuels and growing global energy consumption demands alternatives for petroleum feedstock and sustainable conversion processes for energy production. Thus, applicability of mesoporous manganese oxides on complete catalytic oxidation of methane has been discussed.

40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{increasing}} number of undergraduates, the management of academic papers, an important part of undergraduate education, is faced with more and more difficulties. First, previous academic papers fail to be assorted into valid data for reference, thus resulting in low management efficiency. Second, there are no strict standards for paper title selection and setting. Third, it is hard for supervisors to learn the research progress of every student, so supervisors give effective and immediate guidance and supervision. Against the backdrop, this paper puts forward a solution plan targeted at the defects existing in the modern paper management, namely the SSH comprehensive graduation paper management platform based on Java Web. The system employs the MySQL database and the user interface employs the ExtJs, JQuery and other multiple techniques. In the practical operation, the system perfectly finished the networked management pilot work of graduation paper design of students admitted by Information Technology College of Jilin Agricultural University in 2010 and received high acclaim from teachers and students with its complete functions, <b>stable</b> operations and <b>friendly</b> user interface.

40|$|Abstract- Biodiesel (monoalkyl esters of {{long-chain}} fatty acids) {{has great}} potential {{as an alternative}} to conventional diesel fuel. From environmental point of view it is a renewable, biodegradable and non-polluting source of energy. In this work, biodiesel was produced by enzymatic transesterification reaction. Transesterification is a three step consecutive reaction in which, three moles of biodiesel and one mole of glycerol are produced for every mole of triacylglycerol that undergoes complete conversion. Enzyme method of catalysis can act as a better substitute to the chemical ones as it is specific, thermo <b>stable</b> and environmental <b>friendly.</b> The high cost of liquid enzyme was mitigated by using immobilized lipase enzyme (CALB- DILBEADS TM (10000)) due to its remarkable property of reusability. To further reduce the cost of production, restaurant waste cooking oil (WCO) was used as the feedstock. The effects of alcohol as solvent, enzyme concentration, alcohol to oil molar ratio and reaction time on production of biodiesel were investigated. The results indicated that methanol as solvent, 5 % enzyme concentration, 3 : 1 methanol:WCO molar ratio and 8 hours reaction time was found to be optimum at 37 °C and 150 rpm. Under these optimal conditions, the conversion of FFAs (Free Fatty Acids) to FAMEs (Fatty Acid Methyl Esters) was found to be 99. 71 %...|$|R
40|$|Farmers' {{decisions}} about conversion to organic farming are analyzed with a structural equation model. The Theory of Planned Behavior (ToPB), {{one of the}} prominent theories in the social psychology, is used as the theoretical basis of this study. Though ToPB is a well-defined theory, it is static rather than procedural and cannot model the individual decision-making as a process. Therefore, we first examine the general applicability of ToPB in an agricultural context and explain the variance in intentions of farmers to convert to organic farming. Second, we extend the ToPB {{to make it more}} procedural. For this purpose, research findings from the Diffusion Theory are included as part of the behavioral model. The empirical results indicate that, overall, the model has an acceptable fit to the data. The effects of the additional variables "Goal" and "Communication" are highly significant. This illustrates the importance of forming personal goals in the behavior domain and that people act in a goal-directed, rational way. Moreover, it gives empirical evidence that communication through personal channels has a great impact on individual decision-making. Altogether, this study shows that the extended ToPB provides an appropriate approach to investigate individual decision-making processes in agriculture. behavior research, conversion to particularly animal <b>friendly</b> <b>stabling</b> system, theory of planned behavior, diffusion theory, structural equation modelling, Farm Management, C 8, D 1, Q 12, Z 13,...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, China has {{invested}} heavily in Central Asian energy sources and pipelines, {{on the grounds that}} an overland energy supply from <b>friendly,</b> <b>stable</b> authoritarian countries would be more secure than continued reliance on a maritime energy supply. This paper argues that this strategy rests on false assumptions, and that China’s investment in and growing dependence on Central Asian energy imports is not safer than the alternative. This is largely due to the various governance failures in the five Central Asian states, which create regime instability, succession risk, corruption, labour tensions and intraregional energy conflict. Furthermore, the fact that the Chinese oil and gas pipeline network traverses all five Central Asian countries means that unrest and conflict in any one country can disrupt China’s energy supply from the entire region. These threaten China’s energy supply in Central Asia by undermining the supposed foundation of China’s energy strategy in the region, namely the friendliness and stability of the local regimes and the supply security provided by overland transport routes. Furthermore, China’s economic, diplomatic and legal initiatives to mitigate these governance risks are unlikely to succeed in doing so. Not only do such initiatives presume the continued survival and pro-China attitudes of the Central Asian regimes, they also focus on alleviating the consequences of underlying governance failures in Central Asia rather than addressing the corruption, authoritarianism and other problems which constitute the principal threat to China’s energy strategy in the region...|$|R
