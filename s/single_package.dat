25|$|Integrated MEMS {{oscillators}} with CMOS circuits on {{the same}} IC die have been demonstrated but to date this homogeneous integration is not commercially viable. Instead, it is advantageous to produce the MEMS resonators and CMOS circuitry on separate die and combine them at the packaging stage. Combining multiple die in a <b>single</b> <b>package</b> {{in this way is}} called heterogeneous integration or simply die stacking.|$|E
25|$|The LM324 (released in 1972) was {{one such}} op-amp {{that came in}} a quad package (four {{separate}} op-amps in one package) and became an industry standard. In addition to packaging multiple op-amps in a <b>single</b> <b>package,</b> the 1970s also saw the birth of op-amps in hybrid packages. These op-amps were generally improved versions of existing monolithic op-amps. As the properties of monolithic op-amps improved, the more complex hybrid ICs were quickly relegated to systems that are required to have extremely long service lives or other specialty systems.|$|E

25|$|From 1986 until 2005, the Triple Crown {{television}} rights comprised a <b>single</b> <b>package.</b> In late 2004, the New York Racing Association {{withdrew from}} that agreement to negotiate independently. As {{a result of}} this NBC, who was the rights holder for all three events, was only able to keep its broadcast rights to the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. ABC regained the rights to the Belmont Stakes as part of a five-year contract that expired following the 2010 race; NBC has since regained the rights to the race through 2020.|$|E
25|$|Doubly fed {{electric}} motors have two independent multiphase winding sets, which contribute active (i.e., working) {{power to the}} energy conversion process, {{with at least one}} of the winding sets electronically controlled for variable speed operation. Two independent multiphase winding sets (i.e., dual armature) are the maximum provided in a <b>single</b> <b>package</b> without topology duplication. Doubly-fed {{electric motors}} are machines with an effective constant torque speed range that is twice synchronous speed for a given frequency of excitation. This is twice the constant torque speed range as singly-fed electric machines, which have only one active winding set.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, 1980, HBO {{launched}} Cinemax, {{a companion}} movie-based premium channel created as HBO's answer to fellow movie-oriented pay service The Movie Channel (which operated as a standalone {{service at the}} time). Unlike HBO, Cinemax maintained a 24-hour schedule from its launch. The channel succeeded early on partly due to its reliance on movie classics from the 1950s to the 1970s – with some more recent films mixed in – that would be presented uncut and without commercial interruption, {{at a time when}} cable subscribers only received about three dozen channels due to limited headend channel capacity. In most cases, cable operators sold Cinemax and HBO as a <b>single</b> <b>package,</b> usually offered at a discount for customers that chose to subscribe to both channels.|$|E

25|$|When an {{inductive}} circuit is opened, the current through the inductance collapses quickly, creating a large voltage {{across the open}} circuit of the switch or relay. If the inductance is large enough, the energy may generate a spark, causing the contact points to oxidize, deteriorate, or sometimes weld together, or destroying a solid-state switch. A snubber capacitor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points, thereby preserving their life; these were commonly found in contact breaker ignition systems, for instance. Similarly, in smaller scale circuits, the spark {{may not be enough}} to damage the switch but may still radiate undesirable radio frequency interference (RFI), which a filter capacitor absorbs. Snubber capacitors are usually employed with a low-value resistor in series, to dissipate energy and minimize RFI. Such resistor-capacitor combinations are available in a <b>single</b> <b>package.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2012, AMD's then CEO Rory Read began {{a program}} to offer semi-custom designs. Rather than AMD simply {{designing}} and offering a single product, potential customers could work with AMD to design a custom chip based on AMD's intellectual property. Customers pay a non-recurring engineering fee for design and development, and a purchase price for the resulting semi-custom products. In particular, AMD noted their unique position of offering both x86 and graphics intellectual property. These semi-custom designs would have design wins as the APUs in the Playstation 4 and Xbox One and the subsequent PlayStation 4 Pro, Xbox One S, and Xbox One X. Financially, these semi-custom products would represent {{a majority of the}} company's revenue in 2016. In November 2017, AMD and Intel announced that Intel would market a product, combining in a <b>single</b> <b>package</b> an Intel Core CPU, a semi-custom AMD Radeon GPU, and HBM2 memory.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} two decades, the {{recordings}} were licensed to several record companies, resulting in numerous releases with varying track selections. In 1979, Pickwick Records performed some additional audio filtering and equalisation of the songs on the Lingasong US version, and released it over two volumes as First Live Recordings; the set included the song [...] "Hully Gully" [...] that was mistakenly credited to The Beatles, but was actually performed by Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers, another act on the Star-Club bill. In 1981, Audio Fidelity Enterprises released Historic Sessions in the UK, the first <b>single</b> <b>package</b> with all 30 Beatles tracks from the original Star-Club releases. Several additional songs from the Star-Club tapes have appeared on Beatles bootleg records over the years.|$|E
50|$|If {{the relay}} is driving a large, or {{especially}} a reactive load, {{there may be}} a similar problem of surge currents around the relay output contacts. In this case a snubber circuit (a capacitor and resistor in series) across the contacts may absorb the surge. Suitably rated capacitors and the associated resistor are sold as a <b>single</b> <b>packaged</b> component for this commonplace use.|$|R

500|$|The {{company has}} since {{released}} the XK-3, a single-manual organ {{using the same}} digital tonewheel technology as the New B-3. The XK-3 {{is part of a}} modular system that allows an integrated lower manual and pedals to be added. In response to some clones, including a variety of vintage keyboards in a <b>single</b> <b>package,</b> Hammond released the SK series of organs, which include grand piano, Rhodes piano, Wurlitzer electronic piano, Hohner clavinet, and samples of wind and brass instruments alongside the standard drawbar and tonewheel emulation. Keyboard Magazine Stephen Fortner praised the single manual SK1, indicated that it gave an accurate sound throughout the range of drawbar settings, and said the organ sound was [...] "fat, warm, utterly authentic". The XK-1c model was introduced in early 2014, which is simply an organ-only version of the SK1. An updated flagship organ, the XK-5, was launched in 2016.|$|E
500|$|The album secured for Dylan an [...] "unstoppable cult following" [...] of {{fans who}} {{preferred}} {{the harshness of}} his performances to the softer cover versions released by other singers. Richard Williams {{has suggested that the}} richness of the imagery in Freewheelin transformed Dylan into a key performer for a burgeoning college audience hungry for a new cultural complexity: [...] "For students whose exam courses included Eliot and Yeats, here was something that flattered their expanding intellect while appealing to the teenage rebel in their early-sixties souls. James Dean had walked around reading James Joyce; here were both in a <b>single</b> <b>package,</b> the words and the attitude set to music." [...] Andy Gill adds that in the few months between the release of Freewheelin in May 1963, and Dylan's next album The Times They Are A-Changin' in January 1964, Dylan became the hottest property in American music, stretching the boundaries of what had been previously viewed as a collegiate folk music audience.|$|E
500|$|A four-issue {{comic book}} miniseries, titled , was {{published}} by Dark Horse Comics. Written by Druckmann and illustrated by Faith Erin Hicks, the comics serve as a prequel to the game, chronicling the journey of a younger Ellie and another young survivor Riley. The first issue was published on April 3, 2013, and a reprint became available on May 29, 2013; the second issue was published on the same day, followed by the third issue on June 26, and the fourth issue on July 31. All four issues were republished as a <b>single</b> <b>package</b> on October 30. The game's cover art was unveiled on December 9, 2012, featuring Ellie and Joel; the team fought to feature Ellie on the front cover, despite attempts from external influences to move the image to the back. [...] "I've been in discussions where we've been asked to push Ellie to the back and everyone at Naughty Dog just flat-out refused," [...] said Druckmann.|$|E

500|$|The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Game of the Year Edition was {{announced}} May 12, 2003, and released October 31 {{of the same}} year. It compiled both the Tribunal and Bloodmoon expansions, along with patches available only for the PC release, plus a variety of minor quest and item add-ons, and offered them up in one <b>single</b> <b>package</b> for both PC and Xbox platforms. This provided Xbox players {{with most of the}} game content they had not previously had access to. Absent, however, from the Xbox version was the improved journal included in Bethesda's Bloodmoon and Tribunal releases, as well as the later patched editions of Morrowinds original release. Reviewers responded to the absence negatively. Nonetheless, reviews for the GotY set were generally positive – more so than for all previous releases of the game. Metacritic gave the edition a score of 89; GameRankings, an 88. PC Gamer redistributed this version under their [...] "PC Gamer Presents" [...] line.|$|E
