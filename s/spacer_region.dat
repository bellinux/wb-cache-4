5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} as new to science by mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912. Murrill collected the type material growing near redwoods near Searsville Lake, California, in December 1911. In 1914, Murrill {{decided that the}} species {{was the same as}} Lepiota cristata (which he called Lepiota conspurcata (Willd.) Morgan); this opinion was later corroborated by Walter Sundberg in 1989 after he studied the type collection and concluded that the microscopic characteristics of both were the same. Using molecular analysis based on comparing DNA sequences of the internal transcribed <b>spacer</b> <b>region,</b> mycologist Else Vellinga determined that despite the lack of distinguishing micro-morphological characteristics, the two species were distinct.|$|E

40|$|The <b>spacer</b> A/T <b>region</b> is a {{positive}} cis-acting DNA element that was identified in the Chlamydia trachomatis rRNA promoter region. We have now demonstrated that similar sequences in other chlamydial promoters are important for transcription. Substitution of candidate <b>spacer</b> A/T <b>regions</b> in four chlamydial promoters decreased transcription by partially purified C. trachomatis RNA polymerase in an in vitro transcription assay. Addition of a <b>spacer</b> A/T <b>region</b> to the dnaK promoter, which does not contain an identifiable <b>spacer</b> A/T <b>region,</b> increased transcription 16 -fold. Transcription of Escherichia coli promoters by C. trachomatis RNA polymerase also appeared {{to be dependent on}} the <b>spacer</b> A/T <b>region.</b> However, the effect of the <b>spacer</b> A/T <b>region</b> on transcription by E. coli RNA polymerase was small. In summary, the <b>spacer</b> A/T <b>region</b> is a novel DNA element that is required for high-level transcription of many promoters by chlamydial RNA polymerase...|$|R

5|$|What is now {{recognized}} as a single morphologically variable taxon named Galerina marginata was once split into five distinct species. Norwegian mycologist Gro Gulden and colleagues concluded that all five represented the same species after comparing the DNA sequences of the internal transcribed <b>spacer</b> <b>region</b> of ribosomal DNA for various North American and European specimens in Galerina section Naucoriopsis. The results showed no genetic differences between G.marginata and G.autumnalis, G.oregonensis, G.unicolor, and G.venenata, thus reducing all these names to synonymy. The oldest of these names are Agaricus marginatus, described by August Batsch in 1789, and Agaricus unicolor, described by Martin Vahl in 1792. Agaricus autumnalis was described by Charles Horton Peck in 1873, and later moved to Galerina by A.H.Smith and Rolf Singer in their 1962 worldwide monograph on that genus. In the same publication they also introduced the G.autumnalis varieties robusta and angusticystis. Another of the synonymous species, G.oregonensis, was first described in that monograph. Galerina venenata was first identified as a species by Smith in 1953. Since Agaricus marginatus is the oldest validly published name, it has priority {{according to the rules}} of botanical nomenclature.|$|E

40|$|Spider minor ampullate silk is {{a strong}} non-elastic deformably {{stretchable}} silk used in web formation. This silk from Nephila clavipes is composed of two proteins, MiSp 1 and 2, whose transcripts are 9. 5 and 7. 5 kb, respectively, as determined by Northern blots. Both MiSp proteins are organized into a predominantly repetitive region and a small nonrepetitive carboxy terminal region. These highly repetitive regions are composed mainly of glycine and alanine, but also contain tyrosine, glutamine, and arginine. The sequences are mainly GGX and GA repeats. The repetitive regions are interrupted by nonrepetitive serine-rich <b>spacer</b> <b>regions.</b> Although the sequences of the <b>spacer</b> <b>regions</b> differ from the repetitive regions, sequences of the <b>spacers</b> from different <b>regions</b> of the proteins are nearly identical.

Size of the basidiocarps, color of the pileus, spore size, {{presence or absence of}} cystidia and morphology of the cystidia are the most important characters for morphological species delimitation in the genus. Volvopluteus asiaticus stands apart from other species by the pleurocystidia provided with apical excrescences and the cheilocystidia that are predominantly lageniform.|$|E
25|$|The {{termination}} of transcription of pre-rRNA genes by polymerase Pol I is performed by a system that needs a specific transcription termination factor. The mechanism used bears some resemblance to the rho-dependent termination in prokaryotes. Eukaryotic cells contain hundreds of ribosomal DNA repeats, sometimes distributed over multiple chromosomes. Termination of transcription occurs in the ribosomal intergenic <b>spacer</b> <b>region</b> that contains several transcription termination sites upstream of a Pol I pausing site. Through a yet unknown mechanism, the 3’-end of the transcript is cleaved, generating a large primary rRNA molecule that is further processed into the mature 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNAs.|$|E

The S.quiescens sequences, which were obtained from fruit bodies and from mycorrhizal root tips, formed a [...] clade. The analysis showed that the S.quiescens sequences were matches to some unidentified Suillus sequences found from mycorrhizae of pine seedlings collected from Oregon and California.|$|E

40|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence for the 4. 5 - 5 S ribosomal DNA region from the chloroplastids {{of soya beans}} was determined {{as the basis of}} further comparative studies on the structure and evolution of this intergenic region. Comparisons with other plant sequences as well as equivalent sequences in eubacteria suggest that the longer internal transcribed <b>spacer</b> <b>regions</b> of plants have evolved, at least in part, by DNA sequence duplications and that the presence of the 4. 5 S rRNA in chloroplast may result from the accidental acquisition of a RNA maturation site during the evolution of longer internal transcribed <b>spacer</b> <b>regions.</b> Estimates of the secondary structures also indicate only a very limited retention of structural features and suggest that the primary role of the intergenic sequences may be to bring processed sites into close proximity...|$|R

Trappe, based on specimens they found in Cascade Head in Tillamook County, Oregon, in October and November 1970. The species had also been called Cortinarius elatior, but that name refers to a European species. [...] Within the genus Cortinarius, C.vanduzerensis is classified in the subgenus Myxacium. This subgenus includes species in which both the cap and stem are sticky {{as a result of}} a glutinous universal veil. Based on the nucleic acid sequence similarity in the internal transcribed <b>spacer</b> <b>region,</b> C.vanduzerensis is closely related to the European and North American C.mucifluus and the Costa Rican species C.costaricensis.|$|E
500|$|Molecular {{analyses}} of the internal transcribed <b>spacer</b> <b>region</b> clearly separate the four species currently recognized in Volvopluteus, but morphological identification can be more difficult due to the sometimes overlapping morphological variation among the species. Size of the fruit bodies, color of the cap, spore size, {{presence or absence of}} cystidia and morphology of the cystidia are the most important characters for morphological species delimitation in the genus. V.earlei has smaller fruit bodies (cap less than [...] in diameter), has no pleurocystidia (usually), and the cheilocystidia usually have a very long apical excrescence (outgrowth). In V.asiaticus the majority of the pleurocystidia have an apical excrescence up to 10–15µm long and the cheilocystidia are predominantly lageniform (flask-shaped). V.michiganensis has smaller basidiospores, on average less than 12.5µm long. Volvariella acystidiata, known from central Africa (Zaire) and Italy, somewhat resembles Volvopluteus gloiocephalus. It can be distinguished from the latter by its smaller fruit bodies, with caps up to [...] in diameter, and, microscopically, by the complete absence of cheilo- and pleurocystidia.|$|E
500|$|Many fungy have an asexual {{stage in}} their life cycle, in which they {{propagate}} via asexual spores called conidia. In some cases, the sexual stage—or teleomorph stage—is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. [...] In 2004, researchers reported a connection between C.geaster {{and the appearance of}} blackish-brown tufted structures on rotting wood. By comparing the internal transcribed <b>spacer</b> <b>region</b> of the nuclear ribosomal DNA from the two organisms, they established a phylogenetic connection between Chorioactis and the fungus they called Conoplea aff. elegantula. However, they were unable to induce the new organism to grow on artificial media, and did not definitively establish a teleomorph-anamorph connection between the fungi. In 2009, Japanese researchers found a similar fungus growing on rotting logs that were normally associated with the growth of C.geaster; they were able to grow the organism in axenic cultures from single-spore isolates of C.geaster. Until the one fungus, one name rule was enacted in 2011, the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permitted the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organism, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph(s). So Nagao et al named the anamorph Kumanasamuha geaster due to its morphological similarity with species in the genus Kumanasamuha.|$|E

40|$|A {{means for}} {{distinguishing}} between clinical isolates of Renibacterium salmoninarum {{that is based}} on the PCR amplification of length polymorphisms in the tRNA intergenic <b>spacer</b> <b>regions</b> (tDNA-ILPs) was investigated. The method used primers specific to nucleotide sequences of R. salmoninarum tRNA genes and tRNA intergenic <b>spacer</b> <b>regions</b> that had been generated by using consensus tRNA gene primers. Twenty-one PCR products were sequenced from five isolates of R. salmoninarum from the United States, England, and Scotland, and four complete tRNA genes and <b>spacer</b> <b>regions</b> were identified. Sixteen specific PCR primers were designed and tested singly and in all possible pairwise combinations for their potential to discriminate between isolates from recent clinical outbreaks of bacterial kidney disease (BKD) in the United Kingdom. Fourteen of the isolates were cultured from kidney samples taken from fish displaying clinical signs of BKD on five farms, and some of the isolates came from the same farm and at the same time. The tDNA-ILP profiles separated 22 clinical isolates into nine groups and highlighted that some farms may have had more than one source of infection. The grouping of isolates improved on the discriminatory power of previously reported typing methods based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis and restriction fragment length profiles developed using insertion sequence IS 994. Our method enabled us to make divisions between closely related clinical isolates of R. salmoninarum that have identical exact tandem repeat (ETR-A) loci, rRNA intergenic spacer sequences, and IS 994 profiles...|$|R
