40|$|International audienceThe Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding (MARSIS) onboard the Mars Express {{spacecraft}} has occasionally displayed surprising features. One such {{feature is}} the occurrence {{of a series of}} broadband, low-frequency echoes at equally spaced delay times after the <b>sounder</b> <b>transmitter</b> pulse. The interval between the echoes {{has been shown to be}} at the cyclotron period of electrons orbiting in the local magnetic field. The electrons are believed to be accelerated by the large voltages applied to the antenna by the <b>sounder</b> <b>transmitter.</b> Measurements of the period of these “electron cyclotron echoes” provide a simple technique for determining the magnitude of the magnetic field near the spacecraft. These measurements are particularly useful because Mars Express carries no magnetometer, so this is the only method available for measuring the magnetic field magnitude. Using this technique, results are presented showing the large scale structure of the draped field inside the magnetic pile-up boundary. The magnitude of the draped field is shown to vary from about 40 nT at a solar zenith angle of about 25 °, to about 25 nT at a solar zenith angle of 90 °. The results compare favorably with similar results from the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft. A fitting technique is developed to derive the vector direction and magnitude of the draped magnetic field in cases where the spacecraft passes through regions with significant variation in the crustal field. The magnetic field directions are consistent with current knowledge of the draping geometry of the magnetic field around Mars...|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to winds, {{the observation of}} the atmospheric temperature is vital for clarification of meteorological phenomena. To profile temperature, a balloon-borne radiosonde is commonly employed at an operational weather station. Because the radiosonde is normally released at intervals of 6 to 24  h, the temporal resolution of the soundings is insufficient for the studies of the detailed structure of mesoscale meteorological phenomena. Ground-based remote sensing methods, using radio and optical techniques such as microwave radiometer (e.g., Westwater 1970), Rayleigh and Raman lidars (e.g., Behrendt 2005), and the radio acoustic sounding system (RASS) (e.g., Marshall et al. 1972; Matuura et al. 1986), are developed for continuous monitoring of atmospheric temperature profiles.

After a short description of the dynamics of moving-coil loudspeakers giving emphasis on the advantage of electromechanical coupling reversibility, a proportionalplus-derivative output feedback combined to a feed-forward action is proposed for synthesizing of desired acoustic impedance. As a conclusion, the overall performance of the proposed method is presented along with computed results and general discussions on practical implementation. 1...|$|E

GPS-supported {{localization}} is simple and fast to implement and the reference grid is ubiquitous. However, in locations where the signals of GPS are not available, e. g. indoor, or where the technique is not accurate enough, other position sensing systems have to be used. Usually, a reference grid will be provided by an administrator: Reference points must be deployed and programmed with the correct location information. Especially for temporary installations and dynamic surroundings the setup costs are very high. In our work, we developed a robotic platform, which is capable of deploying itself autonomously and which can operate as a mobile reference point equipped with ultra <b>sound</b> <b>transmitters.</b> Relying {{on a combination of}} two controllers and an odometry system, the platform is able to drive on a complex spline-like trace using only a few supporting points.

40|$|Low-pressure gas {{measurements}} are of increasing {{interest in the}} process industry for both control purposes and emission measurements. Industrial measurement environments include some very challenging components, such as:- Dust, particles, vapor, water droplets, etc. - Temperatures up to 1200 °C- Pipe diameters of 1 to 10 mUltrasound flow measurement techniques have many advantages for such industrial measurement problems. Currently, a major problem {{is the lack of}} transducer technology that is sufficiently robust to operate {{in the presence of the}} above given industrial components. For the purpose of producing more robust technology, a gap discharge <b>sound</b> <b>transmitter</b> has been developed [1, 2]. Theoretical and experimental studies of the gap discharge transmitter indicate that flow measurement performances in the range of 1 - 2 % of the actual flow is achievable [3]. Based on this gap discharge transmitter, an experimental ultrasound gas flowmeter was designed. The design features a gap discharge transmitter and piezo-based receivers. The design was tested in a real industrial environment. The test environment included heavy dust and water vapor in an exhaust pipe at a pelletization plant at LKAB, Kiruna, Sweden. The pipe diameter is 3 m, the pressure is ambient, and the gas flow speed is in the range of 5 - 20 m/s. The flow conditions were highly turbulent, using a straight pipe length ten times the pipe diameter in front of the experimental flowmeter. This paper presents the experimental gap discharge ultrasonic flowmeter design, the experimental setup and some measurement data. These data indicate that the gap discharge transmitter is feasible for operation in an industrial environment. Further preliminary flow measurement data demonstrate the feasibility of using a gap discharge transmitter as the sound-emitting source in an ultrasonic gas flowmeter.

40|$|Transverse {{sections}} of the skull of the Permian therocephalian Glanosuchus sp. were studied {{with regard to the}} structures of the middle ear region. It is generally accepted that most of the skeletal elements of the mammalian middle ear are derived from the postdentary bones of the lower jaw. During synapsid evolution there is a gradual transition from a primitive amniote condition to derived mammalian condition; the latter is characterized by the decoupling of the remaining middle ear elements (angular, prearticular, articular) from the dentary, which forms a secondary jaw articulation with the squamosal. Morganucodon from the Triassic-Jurassic boundary represents an evolutionary stage, where both jaw articulations are present in a coaxial position and where the primary joint is a Pready a fully effective <b>sound</b> <b>transmitter.</b> Therocephalians are considered to be a good representation of the transitory state of this evolutionary process; this may be especially true for primitive taxa such as the lycosuchid Glanosuchus, whose anatomy may represent the "groundplan" (ancestral morphotype) of Lower to Middle Permian eutheriodonts. We studied a complete sectional series of a young specimen of Glanosuchus sp. prepared using the grind-and peel-technique. This showed that the reflected lamina of Glanosuchus is in major parts an extremely thin bony plate, which is best interpreted as a sound-receiving element overlying an air-filled recessus of the pharynx. In this specimen, the vestibular foramen and the stapes are preserved in situ; it is likely, however, that both structures were framed by cartilage which fixed the anular ligament. Both the stapes and the quadrate process of the pterygoid are in direct contact with the quadrate. Comparison of the area of the reflected lamina and the vestibular foramen shows that impedance matching was still very ineffective in Therocephalia when compared to extant mammals. In dieser Arbeit wurden Transversalschnitte des Schädels von dem Therocephalen Glanosuchus sp. im Hinblick auf die Anatomie der Mittelohrregion untersucht. Allgemein wird angenommen, dass die meisten Skelettelemente des Mittelohres der Säuger aus den postdentalen Knochen des Unterkiefers hervorgegangen sind. Der abgeleitete Zustand des Säuger-Mittelohres entstand demnach durch graduelle Abwandlung der ursprünglichen Amniotenkonstruktion. Der abgeleitete Zustand besteht darin, dass u. a. die drei postdentalen Elemente Angulare, Präartikulare und Artikulare aus dem Verband des Unterkiefers herausgelöst wurden, wobei das Dentale nun das Kiefergelenk mit dem Squamosum bildet. In der permotriassischen Gattung Morganucodon existieren beide Kiefergelenke nebeneinander, obwohl das primäre Kiefergelenk bereits die impedanzwandelnde Funktion übernommen hatte. Die Therocephalen sind ein weiteres Beispiel für eine solche evolutionäre Zwischenstellung, und unter diesen ist die ursprüngliche Gattung Glanosuchus besonders interessant. Sie gilt als beispielhaft für den Zustand unter- bis mittelpermischer Eutheriodonten. In der vorliegenden Arbeit untersuchten wir eine vollständige Schnittserie ("Grind-and-peel-Methode") eines juvenilen Glanosuchus sp. Die Lamina reflexa des untersuchten Stückes bildet eine sehr dünne Knochenlamelle, die sich am ehesten als schallübertragendes Element deuten läßt, das eine luftgefüllte Ausstülpung des Pharynx nach außen hin abschloss. Der Stapes und die Fenestra vestibuli des untersuchten Exemplares sind in situ erhalten, doch ist aufgrund fehlender Knochenränder wahrscheinlich, dass beide Strukturen sich knorpelig fortsetzten und durch ein Anularligament verbunden waren. Sowohl der Stapes als auch der Quadratfortsatz des Pterygoids hatten unmittelbaren Kontakt mit dem Quadratum. Das Flächenverhältnis zwischen der Lamina reflexa und der Fenestra vestibuli bei Glanosuchus laßt auf eine noch nicht sehr effektive Schallübertragung schließen. doi: 10. 1002 /mmng. 20020050119 </a...|$|E

Two specific scenarios will be highlighted and discussed that motivated this research: The Interactive Electromechanical Necklace and the Wireless-Batteryless Electronic Sensors. The objective is to wirelessly gather energy from one RF source and convert it into usable DC power that is further applied to a set of low-power-demanding electronic circuits. This idea improves the accomplishments of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags systems. The RF-to-DC conversion objective is accomplished by designing and characterizing an element commonly known as a Rectenna, which consists of an antenna and an associated rectification circuitry. The rectenna is fully characterized in this dissertation and it is used for powering electronic lights, <b>sounds,</b> <b>transmitters,</b> and different types of sensors as well. The wireless power transmission system is presented in the first place with the development of a special set of wearable beads for an interactive necklace. These beads allow physical interaction between the necklace and electronic elements placed in the environment. This scenario demonstrates that passive electronics without batteries are possible. Next I also design and implement low-power sensors that will use the energy delivered from the rectennas to perform active tasks. The switching sensor provides visual/audio feedback to the user when there's a change {{in the state of the}} sensed object (i. e. LEDs lit when a stapler runs out of staples); the humidity sensor permits monitoring the humidity in the soil of a flower pot. The sensor actively transmits the information of any of two possible stages (dry soil/humid soil) to its environment.

40|$|Reduction {{of noise}} in a {{compressor}} {{is a complex}} criterion as many factors of machine enclosure contribute its effect on noise. When a panel of enclosure is acoustically excited, its vibrational response comprises both forced vibrational response at the excitation frequencies, and resonant response of all the relevant structural natural frequencies. These are excited due to the interactions of the forced bending waves with the panel boundaries. The non-resonant, forced modes tend to transmit most of the sound at frequencies below the critical frequency. The resonant frequencies below critical frequency are very poor <b>sound</b> <b>transmitters</b> or radiators. Thus, at frequencies below the critical frequency, mass of the panel controls the reduction in sound transmission since the low frequency resonant structural modes do not radiate or transmit sound. Above the critical frequency, it is the resonant modes that transmit most of the sound. The one qualification to the phenomenan discussed {{here is that the}} incident sound field has to be diffused – i. e. no acoustic standing waves are present in the fluid medium adjacent to the panel. Each structure exhibits certain low and high frequency response. The response of a panel depends on whether it is mechanically or acoustically excited. In this paper, acoustic enclosure for a compressor model is designed and analysis of the enclosure structure is carried out. A method is presented to reduce noise by structural modifications of enclosure. Efforts have been made to make use of experimental data as input to software and methods to do the validation of output results which matches fairly with the experimental data. In acoustic fluid-structural interactions, the structural dynamics equations were considered along with Navier-Stokes equation of fluid momentum and flow continuity equation. The radiation of sound from body can be formulated in terms of an integral equation involving Green’s functions with an imposed radiation. Green’s functions represent solutions to the wave equation – they can also be considered to be either frequency or impulse response functions between the source and receiver. Modeling of enclosure was done. The material used for panels of the enclosure was made of composite steel. The noise measurements on 10 mounting points where compressor comes in contact with the structure were carried. The results were plotted in both frequency and time domain; i. e. dynamic analysis of structure. The analysis of the structure was carried out in NASTRAN. The measured forces were applied to the enclosure structure at mounting points. Response was then measured at desired points. Authors found that, there were some variations in actual measurement data and the results acquired in software analysis. Guiding phenomenon was implemented to reduce the noise i. e. obstacles to the wave propagation were provided. The points where noise level was maximum than the required, barriers, and ribs were provided, etc. Again noise measurements were done. Numbers of iterations were performed until measured noise data tallies with analysis data in the prescribed limit.
