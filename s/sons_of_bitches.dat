500|$|The {{film was}} shot over seven {{days with a}} budget of about $68,000. Both Roger and Gene Corman were present {{for most of the}} film's {{production}} and involved creatively as well as financially. Gene was more involved with running the day-to-day operations while the more experienced Roger Corman supervised and provided guidance to both Gene and Kowalski. Martin Varno was also present for shooting. They operated out of the Charlie Chaplin Studios, which was called Kling Studios at the time. Some rewriting was done as the filming progressed, and director Bernard L. Kowalski called it a collaborative process that involved himself, the Cormans and the whole crew. Varno, however, said he was not happy with how the filming process went, and that the Cormans changed dialogue and story elements without his consultation or permission. He said it reached the point where he called his agent and said, [...] "I am not working for these <b>sons</b> <b>of</b> <b>bitches</b> any more! I am sick and tired of the whole thing!" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{previous}} years, {{the organizers}} {{had made the}} race easier for the Italian favorites by including fewer hard climbs. With the absence of Italian Francesco Moser from this edition, the race organizers included many famous and difficult climbs, such as the Gavia Pass. Moser himself stated that the route contained many difficult climbs and was not helping Italian cycling to prosper {{at a time when}} he believed it to be ailing. When asked about the route for the 1988 edition, [...] rider Bob Roll said [...] "Those <b>sons</b> <b>of</b> <b>bitches</b> put every mountain they could find in the race that year." [...] Three-time winner Gino Bartali also believed the route to be very difficult and in favor of non-Italian competitors. Gino Sala also felt the route was harsher than in years past and that the team time trial could influence the overall classification greatly. La Stampa writer Gian Paolo Ormezzano praised the route saying it was beautiful and well crafted but contained one flaw, in that the race did not finish in any major Italian city. He also expressed his delight with the uphill time trial to Valico del Vetriolo as well as the inclusion of the Stelvio, Rombo and Gavia mountain passes.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Ludlow, who {{had been}} {{slightly}} wounded and had gone down to Chesapeakes cockpit for treatment, now returned to the upper decks, rallying some of the American crew as he did so. Lieutenant Budd joined him with a band of men he had led up the fore-hatch. Ludlow led them in a counter-attack which pushed the British {{back as far as}} the binnacle. However, a wave of British reinforcements arrived, Ludlow received a mortal wound from a cutlass, and the Americans were again thrown back. James Bulger, one of Shannons Irishmen, charged into the Americans wielding a boarding pike and shouting Gaelic curses - [...] "And then did I not spit them, beJaysus!" [...] Lacking officers to lead them (Lieutenant Budd had also been wounded by a cutlass) and lacking support from below, the Americans were driven back by the boarders. American resistance then fell apart, {{with the exception of a}} band of men on the forecastle and those in the tops. A number of the Americans driven from the upper decks jostled each other to get down the main hatchway to the comparative safety of the berth deck. Seeing this, Lt. Cox called to them, [...] "You damned cowardly <b>sons</b> <b>of</b> <b>bitches!</b> What are you jumping below for?" [...] When asked by a nearby midshipman if he should stop them by cutting a few down, Cox replied, [...] "No sir, it is of no use." ...|$|E

500|$|Patton's {{training}} was effective, and on March 17, the U.S. 1st Infantry Division took Gafsa, winning the Battle of El Guettar, and pushing a German and Italian armored force back twice. In the meantime, on April 5, he removed Major General Orlando Ward, commanding the 1st Armored Division, after its lackluster performance at Maknassy against numerically inferior German forces. Advancing on Gabès, Patton's corps pressured the Mareth Line. During this time, he reported to British General Sir Harold Alexander, {{commander of the}} 18th Army Group, and came into conflict with Air Vice Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham {{about the lack of}} close air support being provided for his troops. When Coningham dispatched three officers to Patton's headquarters to persuade him that the British were providing ample air support, they came under German air attack mid-meeting, and part of the ceiling of Patton's office collapsed around them. Speaking later of the German pilots who had struck, Patton remarked, [...] "if I could find the <b>sons</b> <b>of</b> <b>bitches</b> who flew those planes, I'd mail each of them a medal." [...] By the time his force reached Gabès, the Germans had abandoned it. He then relinquished command of II Corps to Bradley, and returned to the I Armored Corps in Casablanca to help plan Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. Fearing U.S. troops would be sidelined, he convinced British commanders to allow them to continue fighting through {{to the end of the}} Tunisia Campaign before leaving on this new assignment.|$|E
500|$|American pressmen {{had been}} alerted to an {{upcoming}} Buddhist demonstration {{to coincide with}} Double Seven Day at Chanatareansey Pagoda {{in the north of}} Saigon. The group, which included Arnett, Browne, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhists filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngô Đình Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around [...] taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas swinging his arms, reportedly saying [...] "Get back, get back, you <b>sons</b> <b>of</b> <b>bitches,</b> or I'll beat the shit out of you!" [...] Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a power pole and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face. The police smashed Browne's camera, but his photographic film survived the impact. The other journalists were jostled and rocks were thrown at them. Photos of Arnett's bloodied face were circulated in US newspapers and caused further ill-feeling towards Diệm's regime, with the images of the burning Thích Quảng Đức on the front pages still fresh {{in the minds of the}} public.|$|E

2500|$|At 17:00 on 6 June, the 3rd Battalion 5th Marines (3/5)—commanded by Major Benjamin S. Berry, and the 3rd Battalion 6th Marines (3/6)—commanded by Major Berton W. Sibley, {{on their}} right—advanced {{from the west}} into Belleau Wood {{as part of the}} second phase of the Allied offensive. Again, the Marines had to advance through a waist-high wheat field into deadly machine gun fire. One of the most famous {{quotations}} in Marine Corps history came during the initial step-off for the battle when Gunnery Sergeant Dan Daly, a recipient of two Medals of Honor who had served in the Philippines, Santo Domingo, Haiti, Peking and Vera Cruz, prompted his men of the 73rd Machine Gun Company forward with the words: [...] "Come on, you <b>sons</b> <b>of</b> <b>bitches,</b> do you want to live forever?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Halsey's skin {{condition}} was so serious, {{he was sent}} on the light cruiser [...] to San Francisco where he was met by a leading allergist for specialized treatment. [...] The {{skin condition}} soon receded but Halsey was ordered to stand down for the next 6 weeks and relax. While detached stateside during his convalescence, he visited family and travelled to Washington D.C. In late August, he accepted a speaking engagement at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. Prior to the discussion of his raids against the Japanese positions in the Marshall Islands, Halsey informed the midshipmen before him, [...] "Missing the Battle of Midway has been the greatest disappointment of my career, but I am {{going back to the}} Pacific where I intend personally to have a crack at those yellow-bellied <b>sons</b> <b>of</b> <b>bitches</b> and their carriers," [...] which was received with loud applause.|$|E
2500|$|Bradley's {{resentment of}} Allen stands in marked {{contrast}} to that of Patton, the U.S. Seventh Army commander in Sicily. Although Patton and Allen frequently argued and even insulted each other, particularly when discussing tactics and leadership styles, the former recognized Allen's competence in building a fighting division. When Patton heard General Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, deliver a lecture on the 'poor discipline' of Allen's 1st Division, Patton contradicted him: [...] "I told him he was mistaken and that anyhow no one whips a dog before putting him into a fight." [...] Nor did personalities dissuade Patton from fighting to get the 1st Infantry Division to carry out the Gela landings in Sicily, which he had correctly surmised would be the most difficult of the Allied assault landings in Sicily. When Patton learned that the 36th Infantry Division, commanded by Major General Fred Walker (whom Allen had served under as ADC during his time with the division), was to be used instead at Gela, he protested to General Eisenhower, claiming [...] "I want those [...] <b>sons</b> <b>of</b> <b>bitches.</b> I won't go without them!"

2500|$|In World War I, battle-tested, veteran Marines {{served a}} central role in the United States' entry into the conflict. Unlike the {{majority}} of Allied armies, the Marine Corps had a deep pool of officers and non-commissioned officers with battle experience, and experienced a smaller growth. They participated in small ways throughout 1918 (such as Château-Thierry, Soissons, and Saint-Mihiel), but its most famous action of the war would come that summer as the Spring Offensive neared its end. From 1 to 26 June, Marines fought their celebrated Battle of Belleau Wood, then the largest in the history of the Corps, creating their reputation in modern history. Rallying under the battle cries of [...] "Retreat? Hell, we just got here!" [...] (Capt Lloyd Williams) and [...] "Come on, you <b>sons</b> <b>of</b> <b>bitches,</b> do you want to live forever?" [...] (GySgt Dan Daly), the Marines drove German forces from the area. While its previous expeditionary experience had not earned it much acclaim in the Western world, the Marines' fierceness and toughness earned them the respect of the Germans, who rated them of storm-trooper quality. Though Marines and American media reported that Germans had nicknamed them [...] or [...] "Devil Dogs", there is no evidence of this in German records. Nevertheless, the name stuck, such as a [...]|$|E
2500|$|Daly is popularly {{attributed}} in Marine Corps lore as yelling, [...] "Come on, you <b>sons</b> <b>of</b> <b>bitches,</b> do {{you want}} to live forever?" [...] to his men during the Battle of Belleau Wood. Daly later told a Marine Corps historian that his words were [...] "For Christ's sake men—come on! Do you want to live forever?" [...] The Chicago Tribune correspondent Floyd Gibbons, who was at Belleau Wood, reported hearing the words in his 1918 memoir And They Thought We Wouldn't Fight, which he attributed to an unnamed gunnery sergeant (Daly was a first sergeant at the time). Gibbons was attached to elements of Major Benjamin S. Berry's battalion (3rd Battalion 5th Marines) during the battle, but Daly was the First Sergeant of the 73rd Machine Gun Company, a part of 3rd Battalion 6th Marines under the command of Major Berton W. Sibley. Sibley's battalion attacked south of Berry's and were on the outskirts of Lucy-le-Bocage when Daly made the cry. Additionally, 6th Marines commander Colonel Albertus W. Catlin implied in his memoir that the yell came from an unnamed sergeant in Berry's battalion.. [...] For his actions at Belleau Wood, he was recommended for a third medal of honor. However, during the processing for his medal, someone thought that awarding three medals of honor to the same man was unacceptable, so Daly was instead awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and later the Navy Cross and French Médaille Militaire.|$|E
2500|$|Organized {{crime was}} just one of many subversive {{elements}} impacting unions. Communism and unethical employee behavior also played significant roles. When a pro-Soviet United Electrical Workers group, led by Jim Lustig, attempted to gain access to secret intelligence and suppress production on a missile being produced by an S.W. Farber plant set for Korea (to match the Soviet Chinese rocket [...] "mangling" [...] U.S. troops), Barasch worked with the employees to eliminate this communist element from the union. Pro-soviet union leaders, clearly threatened, were reported as telling workers at the plant [...] "If we catch any of you <b>sons</b> <b>of</b> <b>bitches</b> playing around with that AFL union, you'll be sorry for it." [...] Barasch also helped organize and participated in the Crusade for Freedom as one of a few select individuals who released 17 balloons at a 1951 ceremony on Bedloes Island to win trade union support for the freedom project in Europe, promoting freedom for countries under Communist power. The following evening, Brigadier General David Sarnoff, chairman of the Greater New York Crusade for Freedom, spoke at a convention of the Allied Trades Council and encouraged New York unions to make the Crusade for Freedom [...] "the greatest labor movement our nation has ever known." [...] Barasch responded in kind, noting [...] "the decision to place the Crusade on the convention's agenda {{is a reflection of the}} deep-felt concern of our membership over the current global struggle for men's minds." ...|$|E

In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew {{what it was like to}} lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You <b>sons</b> <b>of</b> <b>bitches,</b> you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E
