Despite forcing the adoption of the 7.62mm round by NATO, the US re-equipped during the Vietnam War with the M16 rifle, chambered for the 5.56Ã—45mm M193 <b>sub-calibre</b> <b>ammunition.</b> Dissatisfaction with the 7.62mm round led NATO to seek a replacement during the 1970s, and the Belgian SS109 variant of the American M193 was adopted as 5.56mm NATO. Although it had also been intended to establish a NATO standard rifle, this did not materialise and different countries developed their own small arms.|$|E
