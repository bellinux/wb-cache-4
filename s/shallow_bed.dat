60|$|Returning {{over the}} hills, I found Hardwickia binata, a most elegant leguminous tree, tall, erect, with an {{elongated}} coma, and the branches pendulous.

60|$|But, as by {{this theory}} innumerable {{transitional}} forms must have existed, {{why do we}} not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth? It {{will be much more}} convenient to discuss this question in the chapter on the Imperfection of the geological record; and I will here only state that I believe the answer mainly lies in the record being incomparably less perfect than is generally supposed; the imperfection of the record being chiefly due to organic beings not inhabiting profound depths of the sea, and to their remains being embedded and preserved to a future age only in masses of sediment sufficiently thick and extensive to withstand an enormous amount of future degradation; and such fossiliferous masses can be accumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the <b>shallow</b> <b>bed</b> of the sea, whilst it slowly subsides. These contingencies will concur only rarely, and after enormously long intervals. Whilst the bed of the sea is stationary or is rising, or when very little sediment is being deposited, there will be blanks in our geological history. The crust of the earth is a vast museum; but the natural collections have been made only at intervals of time immensely remote.|$|E

6000|$|The lava-streams at {{the eastern}} foot of the Portillo are interesting, not so much from the great {{denudation}} which they have suffered at a comparatively late period as from the evidence they afford by their inclination taken conjointly with their thickness and compactness, that after the great range had assumed its present general outline, it continued to rise as an axis of elevation. The plains extending {{from the base of}} the Cordillera to the Atlantic show that the continent has been upraised in mass to a height of 3,500 feet, and probably to a much greater height, for the smooth shingle-covered margin of the Pampas is prolonged in a gentle unbroken slope far up many of the great valleys. Nor let it be assumed that the Peuquenes and Portillo ranges have undergone only movements of elevation; for we shall hereafter see, that the bottom of the sea subsided several thousand feet during the deposition of strata, occupying the same relative place in the Cordillera, with those of the Peuquenes ridge; moreover, we shall see from the unequivocal evidence of buried upright trees, that at a somewhat later period, during the formation of the Uspallata chain, which corresponds geographically with that of the Portillo, there was another subsidence of many thousand feet: here, indeed, in the valley of Tenuyan, the accumulation of the coarse stratified conglomerate to a thickness of fifteen hundred or two thousand feet, offers strong presumptive evidence of subsidence; for all existing analogies lead to the belief that large pebbles can be transported only in shallow water, liable to be affected by currents and movements of undulation--and if so, the <b>shallow</b> <b>bed</b> of the sea on which the pebbles were first deposited must necessarily have sunk to allow of the accumulation of the superincumbent strata. What a history of changes of level, and of wear and tear, all since the age of the latter secondary formations of Europe, does the structure of this one great mountain-chain reveal! ...|$|E
60|$|Long before I {{undertook}} {{this work}} I was {{no stranger to}} the original. I had also studied Virgil's design, his disposition of it, his manners, his judicious management of the figures, the sober retrenchments of his sense, which always leaves somewhat to gratify our imagination, on which it may enlarge at pleasure; but, above all, the elegance of his expressions and the harmony of his numbers. For, as I have said in a former dissertation, the words are in poetry what the colours are in painting. If the design be good, and the draft be true, the colouring is the first beauty that strikes the eye. Spenser and Milton are the nearest in English to Virgil and Horace in the Latin, and I have endeavoured to form my style by imitating their masters. I will farther own to you, my lord, that my chief ambition is to please those readers who have discernment enough to prefer Virgil before any other poet in the Latin tongue. Such spirits as he desired to please, such would I choose for my judges, and would stand or fall by them alone. Segrais has distinguished the readers of poetry, according to their capacity of judging, into three classes (he might have said the same of writers, too, if he had pleased). In the lowest form he places those whom he calls les petits esprits--such things as are our upper-gallery audience in a playhouse, who like nothing but the husk and rind of wit; prefer a quibble, a conceit, an epigram, before solid sense and elegant expression. These are mob-readers. If Virgil and Martial steed for Parliament-men, we know already who would carry it. But though they make the greatest appearance in the field, and cry the loudest, the best of it is they are but a sort of French Huguenots, or Dutch boors, brought ever in herds, but not naturalised, who have not land of two pounds per annum in Parnassus, and therefore are not privileged to poll. Their authors are of the same level; fit to represent them on a mountebank's stage, or to be masters of the ceremonies in a bear-garden. Yet these are they who have the most admirers. But it often happens, to their mortification, that as their readers improve their stock of sense (as they may by reading better books, and by conversation with men of judgment), they soon forsake them; and when the torrent from the mountains falls no more, the swelling writer is reduced into his <b>shallow</b> <b>bed,</b> like the Mancanares at Madrid, with scarce water to moisten his own pebbles. There are a middle sort of readers (as we held there is a middle state of souls), such as have a farther insight than the former, yet have not the capacity of judging right; for I speak not of those who are bribed by a party, and knew better if they were not corrupted, but I mean a company of warm young men, who are not yet arrived so far as to discern the difference betwixt fustian or ostentations sentences and the true sublime. These are above liking Martial or Owen's epigrams, but they would certainly set Virgil below Statius or Lucan. I need not say their poets are of the same paste with their admirers. They affect greatness in all they write, but it is a bladdered greatness, like that of the vain man whom Seneca describes an ill habit of body, full of humours, and swelled with dropsy. Even these, too, desert their authors as their judgment ripens. The young gentlemen themselves are commonly misled by their pedagogue at school, their tutor at the university, or their governor in their travels, and many of these three sorts are the most positive blockheads in the world. How many of these flatulent writers have I known who have sunk in their reputation after seven or eight editions of their works! for indeed they are poets only for young men. They had great success at their first appearance, but not being of God, as a wit said formerly, they could not stand.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>shallow</b> {{fluidized}} <b>bed</b> boilers is defined and a preliminary working {{design for a}} gas-fired package boiler has been produced. Those areas of the design requiring further study have been specified. Experimental investigations concerning these areas have been carried out. A two-dimensional, conducting paper analog has been developed for the specific purpose of evaluating sheet fins. The analog has been generalised and {{is presented as a}} simple means of simulating the general, two-dimensional Helmholtz equation. By recording the transient response of spherical, calorimetric probes when plunged into heated air-fluidized beds, heat transfer coefficients have been measured at bed temperatures up to 1 100 °C. A correlation fitting all the data to within ± 10 % has been obtained. A model of heat transfer to surfaces immersed in high temperature beds has been proposed. The model solutions are, however, only in qualitative agreement with the experimental data. A simple experimental investigation has revealed that the effective, radial, thermal conductivities of <b>shallow</b> fluidized <b>beds</b> are an order of magnitude lower than the axial conductivities. These must, consequently, be taken into account when considering heat transfer to surfaces immersed within fluidized beds. Preliminary work on pre-mixed gas combustion and some further qualitative experiments have been used as the basis for discussing the feasibility of combusting heavy fuel oils within <b>shallow</b> <b>beds.</b> The use of binary beds, within which the fuel could be both gasified and subsequently burnt, is proposed. Finally, the consequences of the experimental studies on the initial design are considered, and suggestions for further work are made...|$|R

40|$|Variability in the {{abundance}} {{and distribution of}} seagrass-associated fish assemblages was examined at different depths in a temperate bay in southern Australia. Depth differences in seagrass-associated fish assemblages are poorly known but this information is critical given that seagrass loss can occur at specific depths depending on the cause. Overall, 69 species of fish from 26 families were recorded, with higher species richness in <b>shallow</b> than deep <b>beds,</b> with 12 species found only in deep beds and 22 species found only in <b>shallow</b> <b>beds.</b> While the total fish abundance (i. e. abundance of all species recorded) varied between years and seasons, {{and to some extent}} between sites, it was significantly higher in shallow than deep seagrass beds in the majority of cases. Although there was some variation between sites, seagrass tended to be longer and have a higher biomass in <b>shallow</b> than deep <b>beds</b> during both spring and autumn throughout the study. A positive relationship between seagrass biomass/length and total fish abundance/species richness was apparent. Assemblage structure tended to be distinct at each depth, with the largest species recorded in shallow seagrass. Large numbers of small schooling fish, such as atherinids, dominated in shallow seagrass but were not found in deep seagrass. Loss of seagrass could therefore have varying implications for distinct assemblages found at different depths...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Shallow</b> <b>Bed</b> {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics.

The latter is evident on 'Bible Belt', a song dealing with alcoholic parents, where Liddle's vocal nimbly pirouettes over a soft blend of gentle acoustics and orchestral undertones. What's most exciting is Dry The River's ability to open the lid on a song and let it soar; a prime example being the entangled vocal and guitar building throughout 'No Rest', which gloriously explodes by the track's end.

40|$|We {{report an}} {{experimental}} study {{of the dynamics of}} an air-fluidized thin granular layer. Near-onset behavior of this <b>shallow</b> fluidized <b>bed</b> was described in the earlier paper (Tsimring et al, 1999). Above the threshold of fluidization the system exhibits a Hopf bifurcation as the layer starts to oscillate at a certain frequency due to a feedback between the layer dilation and the airflow drag force. After application of temporal band-pass filtering of this frequency we discovered the spatio-temporal dynamics in the form of defect turbulence. This type of dynamics is natural for spatio-temporal systems close to the threshold of a Hopf bifurcation. At high flow rates, low-frequency short-wavelength structures appear in addition to the long-wavelength excitations. A simple model describing the instability and occurrence of oscillations in a <b>shallow</b> fluidized <b>bed,</b> is proposed. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figures, submitted to PR...|$|R

5000|$|In September 2012 it was {{reported}} that the submarine needed to be lifted from its <b>shallow</b> <b>bed</b> in the Kara Sea. The vessel was said to be a [...] "nuclear time bomb", and that the rusting and decaying vessel may be reaching a critical level leading to an [...] "uncontrolled chain reaction". Although a joint Russian and Norwegian mission in 2012 did not find alarming levels of radioactivity in the water and soil surrounding the submarine, an urgent consideration pertains to the dismantling of the nuclear reactors should the submarine be raised. Because the reactors were cooled by liquid metals, the nuclear rods became fused with the coolant when the reactors were stopped and conventional methods cannot be used for disassembling the reactors. However, France's Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives designed and donated special equipment for a dedicated dry-dock (SD-10) in Gremikha, which was used to dismantle the Alfa-class submarines that shared this design feature. However, since the last Alfa reactor was dismantled in 2011, this equipment is at risk.|$|E

5000|$|The {{album and}} {{included}} booklet {{tell the story}} of a woman named Anorexia who begins her story by opening a center for sick and dying children. Like her sister Nervosa, Anorexia's story takes place within two texts. The first section of each chapter tells Anorexia's story in a more stylized, fairy tale-esque and metaphorical manner. Within this text, Anorexia spends the story laboring to build a tower to Heaven which parallels her quest to be remembered for her children's hospital. The subsequent text in each chapter is narrated by Anorexia herself, and takes place in real time in the actual world. While Anorexia's motives seem noble, we learn as the story continues that she is driven by a sinister, selfish desire to become immortalized and praised for her [...] "good deeds". One night while treating a child with an unnamed illness (presumably the HIV virus), Anorexia is stabbed with a dirty syringe and infected with the same illness. As Anorexia is weakened by the disease, she becomes more infamous and her tower to Heaven becomes taller. But on her death bed she finds no solace and realizes that her great tower is merely a <b>shallow</b> <b>bed</b> of stones only feet from the ground. At this point in the story, the real time narrative ceases and the remaining chapters are carried exclusively through metaphorical means. Anorexia, dying on her bed of stones, wakes in a sunlit field and finds that she has been carried to safety by a small lamb who died in the process of rescuing her. The lamb however, resurrects and explains that he had given his life to save Anorexia simply to fulfill his lifelong desire to be with her.|$|E
