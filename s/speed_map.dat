50|$|The last {{remaining}} Georgian town hall in Montgomeryshire. The red brick Town Hall forms a striking termination to Broad Street, although {{the centre of}} the building is offset {{to the north of the}} line of the street. Built by William Baker of Audlem, 1748-51, for Henry Arthur Herbert, 1st Earl of Powis, for whom Baker had also in 1745 provided designs for a new Town Hall at Bishops Castle. In 1828 Thomas Penson, at the expense of Edward Clive, 1st Earl of Powis, raised the roof level over the first floor and introduced sash windows. The clock tower was added in 1921. The predecessor of this building was probably a half-timbered structure, which the <b>Speed</b> <b>map</b> of 1610 shows was sited, lengthways, in the middle of Broad Street.|$|E
5000|$|The River Piddle or Trent or North River is a {{small rural}} Dorset river which rises next to Alton Pancras church. Alton Pancras was {{originally}} named Awultune, a Saxon name meaning the village at {{the source of a}} river. The river's name has Germanic origins and has had various spellings over the years. In AD 966 it was called the 'Pidelen', and on the church tower at Piddletrenthide—the first village to which it gives its name—it is spelled 'Pydel'. Several villages which the river passes through are named after it: as well as Piddletrenthide there are Piddlehinton, Puddletown, Tolpuddle, Affpuddle, Briantspuddle and Turnerspuddle. Local legend tells that the Victorians changed the spelling to 'Puddle', due to 'piddle' being an alternative word for 'piss', (although Puddletown was still called Piddletown into the 1950s), but see for instance the John <b>Speed</b> <b>map</b> of the county from 1610 which has the name 'Puddletown'.|$|E

5000|$|The NTE test, {{as defined}} in CFR 86.1370-2007, {{establishes}} an area (NTE control area) under the torque curve of an engine where emissions must not exceed a specified emission cap for a given pollutant. The NTE cap is set at 1.25 times the FTP emission limit {{as described in the}} subsection above. For 2005 model year heavy-duty engines, the NTE emission cap for NMHC plus NOx is 1.25 times 2.5 grams per brake horsepower-hour, or 3.125 grams per brake horsepower-hour. The basic NTE control area for diesel engines has three basic boundaries on the engine’s torque and <b>speed</b> <b>map.</b> The first is the upper boundary that is represented by an engine’s maximum torque at a given speed. The second boundary is 30 percent of maximum torque. Only operation above this boundary is included in the NTE control area. The third boundary is determined based on the lowest engine speed at 50 percent of maximum power and highest engine speed at 70 percent of maximum power. This engine speed is considered the “15 percent operational engine speed”. The fourth boundary is 30% of maximum power ...|$|E
50|$|Also called Hengestesige (10th century); Hengsteseia (12th century); Henxtesey (13th century); Northengseye (15th century); Laurence Hinksey, Ferry Hinksey, Ivy Hinksey, (passim).North Hinksey was anciently called Hengestseigge, and {{was given}} in 955 to Abingdon Abbey. This place was settled in the Saxon era. Its toponym is thought to mean 'stallion's isle'. Along with the {{neighbouring}} village of South Hinksey, it was once part of the estate of the Benedictine abbey at Abingdon, and was in Berkshire until the boundary changes of 1974. The village appears on the 1610 John <b>Speed</b> <b>map</b> as 'Laurence Hinksey', after the church's dedication, while a 1670s map shows 'Ivy Hinksey'. It was also at one time called Ferry Hinksey, being linked to {{the eastern side of}} Hinksey Stream by a small ferry, reached from west Oxford by way of Ferry Hinksey Road. The ferry ceased operation in 1928, and the various streams are now crossed by small bridges, though a 'Ferry Cottage' remains that matches the period and has access to the river. Ferry Hinksey (as it then was) is also the burial place of Thomas and Rachael Willis (died 1648 and 1631 respectively) the parents of the physician Dr Thomas Willis. He played an important part in the history of anatomy, neurology, and psychiatry, and was {{a founding member of the}} Royal Society.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative Transmission Ultrasound (QTUS) is a tomographic {{transmission}} ultrasound modality that {{is capable}} of generating 3 D speed-of-sound maps of objects in the field of view. It performs this measurement by propagating a plane wave through the medium from a transmitter on one side of a water tank to a high resolution receiver on the opposite side.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to develop the first basic wind <b>speed</b> <b>map</b> for Oman. Hourly mean wind speed records from 40 metrological stations were used in the calculation. The period of continuous records ranged from 4 – 37 years. The maximum monthly hourly mean and the maxima annual hourly mean wind speed data were analysed using the Gumbel and Gringorten methods. Both methods gave close results in determining basic wind speeds, with the Gumbel method giving slightly higher values. Due to a lack of long-term records in some regions of Oman, basic wind speeds were extrapolated for some stations with only short-term records, which were defined as those with only 4 – 8 years of continuous records; in these cases, monthly maxima were used to predict the long-term basic wind speeds. Accordingly, a basic wind <b>speed</b> <b>map</b> was developed for a 50 -year return period. This map was based on basic wind speeds calculated from actual annual maxima records of 29 stations with at least 9 continuous years of records as well as predicted annual maxima wind speeds for 11 short-term record stations. The basic wind speed values ranged from 16 meters/second (m/s) to 31 m/s. The basic wind <b>speed</b> <b>map</b> developed in {{this research}} is recommended for use as a guide for structural design in Oman...|$|E

40|$|The Antarctic {{ice sheet}} {{response}} to the global climate change, specifically the ice flow speed change of the glaciers, has been investigated by many researchers. However, most research results cover the period since 1970 s or after {{the operation of the}} LANDSAT series. The availability of the film-based ARGON KH- 5 data makes it possible to quantify the changes of the Antarctic ice sheet in 1960 s. To meet the challenges of processing the low quality film-based ARGON images, a novel method was developed to allow estimating the ice sheet surface motion and reconstructing the surface model simultaneously from ARGON stereo images by decomposing the total parallaxes to terrain and motion based components. A photogrammetric approach was developed to distinguish stable ice surface features from those on motion and use them for recovering the camera orientation information. Several existing Antarctic mapping products were used to establish the ground control. The ice flow speed field is reconstructed using a hierarchical image matching strategy. Firstly, epipolar images are generated via a fundamental matrix derived from correspondences used in the geometric modelling process, and then an image pyramid is built. Second, the normalized cross-correlation (NCC) technique is conducted on each layer of the pyramid to match the extracted features. Since the images were taken at different times, during which the glacier motion occurred, the measured total parallaxes are decomposed to terrain and motion parallaxes according to given ice flow directions which are derived from the iteratively produced DTM or images. Finally, a <b>speed</b> <b>map</b> and a DTM can be generated at each level of the image pyramid. This process repeats itself. At the bottom of the pyramid the final <b>speed</b> <b>map</b> and DTM are produced at a resolution of about 60 m and represent the ice flow field of 1963. This approach was tested using two ARGON stereo-pairs in Rayner glacier in East Antarctica. Both the ice flow <b>speed</b> <b>map</b> and DTM were generated, and their difference with recent products is briefly discussed...|$|E

40|$|The Neolithic {{transition}} is {{the shift from}} hunting-gathering into farming. About 9000 years ago, the Neolithic transition began to spread from the Near East into Europe, until it reached Northern Europe about 5500 years ago. There are two main models of this spread. The demic model assumes that it was mainly due to the reproduction and dispersal of farmers. The cultural model assumes that European hunter-gatherers become farmers by acquiring domestic plants and animals, aswell as knowledge, from neighbouring farmers. Here we use the dates of about 900 archaeological sites to compute a <b>speed</b> <b>map</b> of {{the spread of the}} Neolithic transition in Europe. We compare the <b>speed</b> <b>map</b> to the speed ranges predicted by purely demic, demic-cultural and purely cultural models. The comparison indicates that the transition was cultural in Northern Europe, the Alpine region and west of the Black Sea. But demic diffusion was at work in other regions such as the Balkans and Central Europe. Our models can be applied to many other cultural traits. We also propose that genetic data could be gathered and used to measure the demic kernels of Early Neolithic populations. This would lead to an enormous advance in Neolithic spread modellinThis work {{was supported in part by}} ICREA (Academia award) and MINECO (grants SimulPast-CSD- 2010 - 00034 and FIS- 2012 - 31307...|$|E

Ideally, if the accurate detection of the arrival time of the oscillation at different locations and the actual wave <b>speed</b> <b>map</b> [18] were both available, the source location result should be correct and accurate. It is shown in [19] that the earliest detected peak of the oscillation always first appears at the generator with forced oscillation, i.e. oscillation source. Such phenomenon is claimed in another way [20] that the oscillation phase of the bus far away from the disturbance is lagging that of the bus close to the disturbance.|$|E

For local areas, ground observations might be insufficient and modeling of historical or stochastic simulated TCs based on the Monte-Carlo method (Russell 1969; Huang et al. 2001) is needed. For larger areas, methods using basin-wide stochastic simulations of full TC tracks have been developed (Vickery et al. 2000; Emanuel et al. 2006).|$|E
