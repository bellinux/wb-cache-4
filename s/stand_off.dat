5|$|The Persian {{infantry}} used in {{the invasion}} was probably a heterogeneous group drawn from across the empire. However, according to Herodotus, {{there was at least}} a general conformity in the type of armour and style of fighting. The troops were, generally speaking, armed with a bow, 'short spear' and sword, carried a wicker shield, and wore at most a leather jerkin. The one exception to this may have been the ethnic Persian troops, who may have worn a corslet of scale armour. Some contingents would have been armed somewhat differently; for instance, the Saka were renowned axemen. The 'elite' contingents of the Persian infantry seem to have been the ethnic Persians, Medians, Cissians and the Saka; Herodotus specifically mentions the presence of Persians and Saka at Marathon. The style of fighting used by the Persians was probably to <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> from an enemy, using their bows (or equivalent) to wear down the enemy before closing in to deliver the coup de grace with spear and sword.|$|E

5|$|Tensions between Britain and the Russian Empire in the 1850s, as starkly {{demonstrated}} by the Crimean War, along with Australia-wide moves towards self-government caused a reassessment of the colony's defence posture. The various colonies regarded themselves as possible targets for the Russian Pacific Fleet, then based in Siberia. In 1854, Governor Henry Young appointed a commission under Boyle Travers Finniss {{to report on the}} defence of the colony, in case of war. Boyle's report recommended leaving strategic defence {{in the hands of the}} Imperial Navy, though South Australia was to purchase a 400-ton naval vessel. Local defence was to be largely handled by the existing small Imperial garrison and local colonial force, supported by the artillery obtained in 1847. When the Crimean War ended in 1856, the danger passed and the perceived need for expensive defence preparations with it. For many years nothing substantive came about from debate on defence of the colony. Over time there formed a consensus favouring Semaphore for fixed defences or fortification; a strategy also argued by the government established Hart Commission in 1858. Raiders were seen as unlikely to force the shallows of the Port River but instead were expected to <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> Semaphore, shell the port and use their guns to support landings. The Hart Report recommended building of martello towers at Semaphore and Glenelg, the first report to recommend permanent fortification at Semaphore, though none were built mainly due to the cost.|$|E

25|$|Alluding to {{past and}} recent {{proposals}} of cease-fire negotiations, Ridgway also advised that future governmental decisions might compel the Eighth Army {{to adopt a}} static defense. Because of its inherent rigidity, such a stance would require strong leadership and imaginative tactical thinking, he warned, to <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> a numerically stronger enemy {{that might not be}} similarly inhibited in the choice of tactics.|$|E

25|$|A duel then {{commenced}} at extreme close range, {{during which}} both ships were heavily damaged. Sailors {{on both sides}} were also burned by the flashes of their enemy's cannon. Congresss rigging was torn to shreds during the exchange, which compelled the Americans to <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> for quick repairs. After doing so, they resumed the chase. Congress was swiftly alongside the Savage again and another duel began.|$|E
25|$|In {{case of an}} Italian surface attack, {{the first}} five {{divisions}} were to <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> from the convoy to face the enemy while the sixth division laid smoke across {{the wake of the}} convoy to obscure it from the enemy. The first five divisions would act as a rearguard to lay smoke and delay the enemy while Carlisle and the Hunt-class destroyers proceeded with the cargo ships to Malta.|$|E
25|$|The {{distance}} between the defender line and the midfielder line should be kept constant at about 15 metres. However, the defensive line should back up and thus increase this distance, <b>stand</b> <b>off,</b> {{when there is no}} pressure on the opponent in possession, as this increases the possibility of a through ball. With tough pressure on the opponent, the distance may be reduced to below 15 metres. Also, as opponents move in close to the penalty area, the defending team will be forced to move their midfielders ever closer to their defenders.|$|E

25|$|As {{the crew}} of Andrew Doria worked the ship into {{position}} to reenter the engagement and opened fire, Glasgows captain realized he was overmatched and decided to <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> to the northward. Andrew Doria, followed at a distance by her consorts, gave chase and kept up a running fight with her bow chasers until recalled by Hopkins, lest Glasgow lead his fleet to a Royal Navy squadron then operating in Rhode Island waters. When the American fleet had reformed, it retired to New London, Connecticut, where it arrived {{on the morning of}} 8 April.|$|E
25|$|The French fleet soon appeared, but Ribault faltered. Had he landed, {{success was}} possible; a way was open for retreat by {{land and water}} to his fort on the St. Johns. However, he chose to <b>stand</b> <b>off.</b> Menéndez, a more practiced seaman, {{saw that he had}} an advantage; he had scanned the sky for weather signs, and knew that a norther was coming. The French fleet would be swept before it and perhaps be wrecked, or {{escaping}} that, be driven so far that days would elapse before Ribault could make an attack.|$|E
25|$|In 1912–1913, the Liberal {{government}} in Britain proposed a Bill for Home Rule.

Arising out of this <b>stand</b> <b>off,</b> the partition of Ireland was proposed in three way talks between the Irish Parliamentary Party, the Unionist Party and the British government. In 1914, the UK Parliament enacted a Third Irish Home Rule Bill but suspended its effect until after World War I.|$|E

They drove her to a remote pine <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> of South Berkeley Lake Road in Gwinnett County near Duluth and buried Mackle in a shallow trench inside of a fiberglass-reinforced box. The box was outfitted with an air pump, a battery-powered lamp, water laced with sedatives, and food. Two plastic pipes provided Mackle with outside air.|$|E

25|$|Its {{entry in}} Cancer in 1913, the sign {{in which it}} was later discovered, coincided with World War I. It is also {{associated}} with nuclear armament, which had its genesis in the research of the 1930s and 40s. Later on, it gave rise to the polarized nuclear <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> of the Cold War, with the mass consumer societies of the United States and other democracies facing the totalitarian state of the USSR. The discovery of Pluto also occurred just after the birth of modern psychoanalysis, when Freud and Jung began to explore the depths of the unconscious.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{as of late}} May, the <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> {{between the}} French and the British as to {{disposition}} of forces continued, the French continued to press for a replacement of British by French troops in Syria amid arguments about precise geographical limits of same and in general the relationship suffered; after the meeting on the 21st, Lloyd George had written to Clemenceau and cancelled the Long–Bérenger Oil Agreement(a revised version {{of which had been}} agreed at the end of April)claiming to have known nothing about it and not wanting it to become an issue while Clemenceau claimed that had not been the subject of any argument.|$|E
25|$|However, {{issues with}} the {{president}} over the authority circled and a subsequent political <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> was instigated between president and Prime minister. Finally, in July 1993, Sharif resigned {{under pressure from the}} Pakistan Armed Forces but negotiated a settlement that resulted in the removal of president Ghulam Ishaq Khan as well. In July 1993, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Shamim Allam and the Chief of Army Staff General Abdul Vahied Kakar forced president Ishaq Khan to resign from the presidency and subsequently ended the political standoff. Under the close scrutiny of the Pakistan Armed Forces, the new interim and transitional government was formed and new parliamentary election were held after three months.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the fire}} below decks {{increased}} steadily in intensity, and those topside could hear explosions. Her list increased, first to 10° and then 15°. Her stern lowered {{in the dark}} waters, and her bow was distinctively rising. All attempts to shore the shell holes – by then below the waterline due to the increasing list – proved ineffective, and the list increased still more. Buchanan arrived at 11:30, but could not approach due to the heavy port list. Directed to <b>stand</b> <b>off</b> the starboard quarter, she stood by while all hands assembled on the stern, which was now wet with seawater. With the port waterway awash at noon, Commodore William G. Greenman gave the order to abandon ship.|$|E
