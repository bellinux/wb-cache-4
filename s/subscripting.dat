40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] is a {{trace gas}} that {{contributes}} to the greenhouse effect and stratospheric ozone depletion. The N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] yield from nitrification (moles N 2 O-N [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O - N] produced per mole ammonium-N consumed) has been used to estimate marine N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] production rates from measured nitrification rates and global estimates of oceanic export production. However, the N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] yield from nitrification is not constant. Previous culture-based measurements indicate that N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] yield increases as oxygen (O 2) [O <b>subscript</b> 2] concentration decreases and as nitrite (NO 2 −) [NO <b>subscript</b> 2 overscore] concentration increases. Here, we have measured yields of N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] from cultures of the marine β-proteobacterium [beta-proteobacterium] Nitrosomonas marina C- 113 a as they grew on low-ammonium (50 μM) [50 mu M] media. These yields, which were typically between 4 × 10 − 4 [10 superscript - 4] and 7 × 10 − 4 [10 superscript - 4] for cultures with cell densities between 2 × 102 [10 super script 2] and 2. 1 × 104 [10 superscript 4] cells ml− 1 [ml superscript - 1], were lower than previous reports for ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. The observed impact of O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2] concentration on yield was also smaller than previously reported under all conditions except at high starting cell densities (1. 5 × 106 cells ml− 1) [1. 5 x 10 superscript 6 cells ml superscript - 1], where 160 -fold higher yields were observed at 0. 5 % O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2](5. 1 μM [mu M] dissolved O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2]) compared with 20 % O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2] (203 μM [mu M] dissolved O 2 O <b>subscript</b> 2]). At lower cell densities (2 × 102 [10 superscript 2] and 2. 1 × 104 [10 superscript 4] cells ml− 1 [ml superscript - 1]), cultures grown under 0. 5 % O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2] had yields that were only 1. 25 - to 1. 73 -fold higher than cultures grown under 20 % O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2]. Thus, previously reported many-fold increases in N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] yield with dropping O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2] could be reproduced only at cell densities that far exceeded those of ammonia oxidizers in the ocean. The presence of excess NO 2 − [NO <b>subscript</b> 2 overscore] (up to 1 mM) in the growth medium also increased N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] yields by an average of 70 % to 87 % depending on O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2] concentration. We made stable isotopic measurements on N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] from these cultures to identify the biochemical mechanisms behind variations in N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] yield. Based on measurements of δ 15 Nbulk [delta superscript 15 N superscript bulk], site preference (SP = δ 15 Nα−δ 15 Nβ [delta superscript 15 N superscript alpha - delta superscript 15 N superscript beta]), and δ 18 O [delta superscript 18 O] of N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] (δ 18 O-N 2 O [delta superscript 18 O - N <b>subscript</b> 2 O]), we estimate that nitrifier-denitrification produced between 11 % and 26 % of N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] from cultures grown under 20 % O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2] and 43 % to 87 % under 0. 5 % O 2 [O <b>subscript</b> 2]. We also demonstrate that a positive correlation between SP and δ 18 O-N 2 O [delta superscript 18 O - N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] is expected when nitrifying bacteria produce N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O]. A positive relationship between SP and δ 18 O-N 2 O [delta superscript 18 O - N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] has been observed in environmental N 2 O [N <b>subscript</b> 2 O] datasets, but until now, explanations for the observation invoked only denitrification.

The outer radius, r 0 [r <b>subscript</b> 0], is determined from r 12 [r <b>subscript</b> 12] using an outer wind structure model that assumes no deep convection beyond r 12 [r <b>subscript</b> 12]. The global median values of r 12 [r <b>subscript</b> 12] and r 0 {r <b>subscript</b> 0] are 197 km and 423 km, respectively, with statistically significant variation across ocean basins. The global distribution of r 12 [r <b>subscript</b> 12] is found to be approximately log-normal, the distribution of r 0 [r <b>subscript</b> 0] is quantitatively much closer to log-normal, and the improvement in fit between r 12 [r <b>subscript</b> 12] and r 0 [r <b>subscript</b> 0] is attributed to the combined effect {{of the nature of the}} model employed and the paired distributions of r 12 [r <b>subscript</b> 12] and f.
