25|$|Coup d'Etat was a {{breakthrough}} album {{that began to}} blend the punk and metal genres, something that would later be done {{time and time again}} by bands such as S.O.D., Anthrax, and the Cro-Mags {{by the end of the}} 1980s. Wendy also broke ground for her unique singing style. She pushed her vocals <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> had to make trips into Cologne, Germany, where the album was being recorded, each day for treatments to avoid permanent damage to her vocal cords.|$|E
2500|$|In one of {{her last}} film roles, The Secret of Santa Vittoria (1969), she co-starred with Anthony Quinn, and they played husband and wife in what Life {{magazine}} called [...] "perhaps the most memorable fight since Jimmy Cagney smashed Mae Clarke {{in the face with}} a half a grapefruit." [...] Magnani and Quinn did feud in private outside view of the cameras, however, and their animosity spilled over into their scenes:"By the time the movie makers were ready to shoot the fight scene, the stars were ready too. Magnani not only went for Quinn with the pasta and with a rolling pin, but with her foot; she kicked <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> broke a bone in her right foot. She also bit him in the neck. 'That's not in the script', Quinn protested. Magnani snarled, 'I'm supposed to win this fight, remember?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "She doesn't {{look as if}} {{she knew}} much," [...] said another child, who was kept {{studying}} <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that <b>she</b> never had time to dig and run, and make dirt-pies, till she fell ill, {{and had to be}} sent to the sea-side.|$|R

6000|$|... "One {{thing that}} Polly does Sunday nights, {{is to take}} Will's head in her lap, and smooth his forehead. It rests him after {{studying}} <b>so</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>she</b> says.

60|$|A half-hour {{later they}} stole away {{toward the back}} of the garden and out upon the prairie, where a Mexican was holding a {{spirited}} team. Fan was giggling <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that <b>she</b> was barely able to lift the valise which she carried in her hand.|$|R
6000|$|At last Rose gave up resistance. Her {{heart beat}} <b>so</b> terribly <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> felt smothered, but she recited a blank verse poem. It was {{an echo of}} Tennyson, of course, not exactly [...] "Enoch Arden," [...] but {{reminiscent}} of it, but the not too critical taste of Dr. Sanborn and Prof. Roberts accepted it with applause.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because she was tugging <b>so</b> <b>hard.</b> <b>She</b> {{would have}} pulled us to pieces, {{and it was}} better to let her go than to risk that. She will have drifted the same way we have done, only she will have gone three times as fast, for she was a good deal higher out of water, and the paddles which I {{fastened}} on to her head-rope won't have anything like the hold on the water that our spars have. We will keep in the same direction when we get our sails up, and if she has lived through it we shall very likely find her ashore somewhere along the coast. Now be sure you lash that kettle securely to the deck-beam, Luka. Put it as near one side as you can get it, then there will be room for you to lie alongside and watch it. But stop! Before you fasten it pour out half a mugful of water for Jack. He doesn't like tea, and there will be nothing but tea for him after we have once made it." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were other}} {{reminders}} to us, {{and to the}} little town, of the blood-red line drawn across the map of France. We had in our hospital men from the invaded countries without news of wives and families mured up behind that iron veil. Once in a way a tiny word would get through to them, and anxiety would lift a little from their hearts; {{for a day or}} two they would smile. One we had, paralysed in the legs, who would sit doing macram√© work and playing chess all day long; every relative he had--wife, father, mother, sisters--all were in the power of the German. As brave a nature as one could see in a year's march, touchingly grateful, touchingly cheerful, but with the saddest eyes I ever saw. There was one little reminder in the town whom we could never help going in to look at whenever we passed the shop whose people had given her refuge. A little girl of eight with the most charming, grave, pale, little, grey-eyed face; there she would sit, playing with her doll, watching the customers. That little refugee at all events was beloved and happy; only I think she thought we would kidnap her one day--we stared at her <b>so</b> <b>hard.</b> <b>She</b> had the quality which gives to certain faces the fascination belonging to rare works of art.|$|E

6000|$|Old Mother West Wind {{suddenly}} {{puffed out}} {{her cheeks and}} blew <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that <b>she</b> blew a big stick {{right out of the}} bottom of the old nest.

60|$|This was a {{question}} that Hetta was hardly prepared to answer. She felt quite certain that under no circumstances would she run away with a man. 'I don't quite know. It is <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to say,' <b>she</b> replied.|$|R
6000|$|They passed briskly down Pulteney Street, {{and through}} Laura Place, without the {{exchange}} of many words. Thorpe talked to his horse, and she meditated, by turns, on broken promises and broken arches, phaetons and false hangings, Tilneys and trap-doors. As they entered Argyle Buildings, however, she was roused by this address from her companion, [...] "Who is that girl who looked at you <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> as <b>she</b> went by?" ...|$|R
5000|$|When Stein and {{his film}} editor, Ed Rothkowitz, soon previewed a 17-minute {{compilation}} of clips from their US television appearances {{to the band}} and their wives, they could hardly believe the reaction. [...] "Townshend was on the floor, banging his head. He and Moon were hysterical. Daltrey's wife was laughing <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> knocked over the coffee table in the screening room. Their reaction was unbelievable. They loved it. That's when they were really convinced that the movie was worth doing." ...|$|E
50|$|Another {{story is}} about Stans van 't Gansken, a wheedling woman. She hid aside a place in Antwerp where mothers could abandon their newborn babies. Stans haggled the woman: {{if they did not}} give her a large amount of hush money, Stans would inform {{everybody}} that she knew about the child abandonment. Everyone paid her. One day, Stans found a baby in front of her door. She took the child and wanted to dump it at the child abandonment location. Suddenly, the baby turned into a giant. It was Lange Wapper. He beat the woman <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> would never forget. Since then, Stans was never seen again near the child abandon location.|$|E
50|$|Greta is {{stranded}} {{when her}} driver and pilot leave her behind {{at the start}} of the Battle of Kursk as she takes too long to pack her belongings. Charlotte forces her to help tend to wounded Heer soldiers at her field hospital, and the experience clearly traumatizes Greta. By chance she manages to return to Berlin, where she openly expresses her doubts in the Endsieg, and angers Dorn by revealing their affair to his wife, both of which lead to her getting arrested and imprisoned for Wehrkraftzersetzung ("subversion of the war effort"). When she is arrested, she reveals that she had become impregnated by Dorn. He is shocked by this and then punches her in the stomach <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> passes out. She is executed by a firing squad in the final days of the war.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{of course}} she likes {{everything}} that's nice." [...] And Owen, who constitutionally disliked questions--an answer was almost as hateful {{to him as a}} [...] "trick" [...] to a big dog--smiled kindly at Fleda and conveyed that she would understand what he meant even if his mother didn't. Fleda, however, mainly understood that Mrs. Gereth, with an odd, wild laugh, held her <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that <b>she</b> hurt her.|$|R

5000|$|... "I {{actually}} {{wrote this}} for myself to sing, but then I realised I wanted {{a girl to}} sing it. My friend recommended Stax Osset and when I heard her I knew she was perfect for it.

50|$|The next day, before Fawn {{could move}} him, Gruff disappears and indeed {{transforms}} into the monster {{depicted in the}} fairy lore. growing wings and horns.

Fawn realizes she misunderstood the whole thing, so she and Tink set off to free Gruff.|$|E
5000|$|On April 20, 2017, Hay and his {{daughter}} Iliana Eve were victims of a home invasion and were held at gunpoint and duct-taped. Hay told the New York Daily News, [...] "My young daughter was pistol whipped <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> {{fell to the ground}} and her glasses broke. There's no way anyone deserves that kind of violence, especially a little girl. It was a traumatizing ordeal as they were threatening to kill my child and I the entire time. They kept putting pillows to my head with a gun pressed in. For my daughter to experience such horror is truly evil. To have guns pointed at her and to see her Dad duct-taped are images she will probably never be able to escape {{for the rest of her}} life." [...] The suspect was arrested and charged with first degree robbery, two counts of kidnapping, possession of a handgun by a convicted felon, receiving stolen property, possession of drug paraphernalia and two counts fraudulent use of a credit card.|$|E

6000|$|He {{admired her}} firmness, though {{with a certain}} impatience. Women never quite looked ahead; never quite {{realized}} all the consequences of anything. And he thought: 'By George!

50|$|In the present, {{right before}} feeding on Gali's light, Gorast {{is picked up}} by Onua and slammed into the ground <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> almost snaps into pieces. Gali {{turns out to be}} all right, and Onua and her escape, Gorast and Bitil wildly on their tails. They {{eventually}} arrive at the scene of Tahu's dismay, and a short battle ensues. Chirox, another Makuta, is seen falling out of the sky, and the other three rush to help him, leaving the three Toa Nuva alone. They are guided deeper in the swamp by an Av-Matoran who had appeared to help them escape. They eventually arrive at a small ground surrounded by Lightvines. The Nuva are horrified by what they see in the middle: Matoran-like forms are undergoing strange changes. Suddenly, the forms change into Bohrok, leaving the Toa puzzled. The Av-Matoran explains that the first Bohrok had evolved from Av-Matoran, and the transformations came naturally. Gali takes her eyes off of the robots for a moment, and when she looks back, they are gone. The Matoran guide hands Onua a Keystone, and then lies down and transforms into a Bohrok, and disappears like his other brothers. Tahu then expresses his subtle rage toward the fact that that was the price to be paid for Mata Nui's awakening.|$|E
5000|$|After leaving high school, {{she joined}} The Davis Sisters in 1955, {{at the start}} of their tenure with Herman Lubinsky and Ozzie Cadena's record label Savoy Records of Newark, New Jersey. How she came to sing with one of gospel's famous groups is a typical Golden Age gospel tale. Raised in the Church of God in Christ, she was a soloist in the choir of Faith Temple in New York, pastored by Bishop A.A. Childs (the church would later serve as the site of Malcolm X's last rites). Ruth Davis was {{attending}} a broadcast at which Jackie was singing and the rest is gospel history. Jackie Verdell possessed a powerful mezzo-soprano voice, and her performances on records such as [...] "Lord Don't Leave Me", [...] "Following Him", and [...] "I Don't Know What I'd Do" [...] made an impression on the young Aretha Franklin, amongst others. [...] "I also considered Jackie Verdell of the Davis Sisters one of the best and most underrated female soul singers of all time" [...] said Franklin in her 1999 autobiography Aretha: From These Roots. [...] ""It was through Jackie that I learned the expression 'Girl, you peed tonight'--meaning you were dynamite. Several nights Jackie sang <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> literally had a spot or two on her robe from peeing. Singing far too hard, I also peed here and there in the early days; I quickly realized no one should sing that hard." [...] Verdell was second lead for The Davis Sisters between 1955 and 1960, featuring on many of their Savoy recordings.|$|E

She said the crew was blindfolded and handcuffed at gunpoint, and their driver beaten. They were advised to leave the country, but were later released. On 15 February 2011, CBS News released a statement that Logan had been beaten and sexually assaulted on 11 February, while covering the celebrations in Tahrir Square following Hosni Mubarak's resignation. In Logan's own words, they raped her with their hands, while taking photographs with their cellphones. They began pulling her body in different directions, pulling her hair <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> said it seemed they were trying to tear off chunks of her scalp.Believing she was dying, she was dragged along the square to where the crowd was stopped by a fence, alongside which a group of women were camping. One woman wearing a chador put her arms around Logan, and the others closed ranks around her, while some men who were with the women threw water at the crowd. A group of soldiers appeared, beat back the crowd with batons, and one of them threw Logan over his shoulder. She was flown back to the U.S. the next day, where she spent four days in the hospital. She was contacted by US president Barack Obama when she arrived home. CBS said it remained unclear who the attackers were, and unlikely that any will be prosecuted.|$|E
