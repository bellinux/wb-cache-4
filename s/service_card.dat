The research began with a statistical analysis of the career characteristics of women and men in teaching in one educational authority using data collated from Teachers' <b>Service</b> <b>Cards.</b> Then the research focused on women in primary teaching. Career history interviews were conducted with twenty-five married women who were headteachers of primary or infant schools from two educational areas of an English midlands county. The data for the research consisted of the Teachers' <b>Service</b> <b>Cards,</b> the interview material, together with DES official statistics on Teachers in Service.
