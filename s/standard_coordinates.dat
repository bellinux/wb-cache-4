5000|$|... on notation: In this article, {{we follow}} the {{convention}} from differential geometry in which multivectors and multicovectors are written with lower and upper indices, respectively. Since differential forms are multicovector fields, upper indices are employed to index them. [...] The opposite rule applies to the components of multivectors and multicovectors, which instead are written with upper and lower indices, respectively. For instance, we represent the <b>standard</b> <b>coordinates</b> of vector [...] as , so that [...] {{in terms of the}} standard basis [...] In addition, superscripts appearing in the denominator of an expression (as in [...] ) are treated as lower indices in this convention. When indices are applied and interpreted in this manner, the number of upper indices minus the number of lower indices in each term of an expression is conserved, both within the sum and across an equal sign, a feature that serves as a useful mnemonic device and helps pinpoint errors made during manual computation.|$|E

40|$|The {{enumeration}} {{of normal}} surfaces {{is a crucial}} but very slow operation in algorithmic 3 –manifold topology. At {{the heart of this}} operation is a polytope vertex enumeration in a high-dimensional space (<b>standard</b> <b>coordinates).</b> Tollefson’s Q– theory speeds up this operation by using a much smaller space (quadrilateral coordinates), at the cost of a reduced solution set that might not always be sufficient for our needs. In this paper we present algorithms for converting between solution sets in quadrilateral and <b>standard</b> <b>coordinates.</b> As a consequence we obtain a new algorithm for enumerating all standard vertex normal surfaces, yielding both the speed of quadrilateral coordinates and the wider applicability of <b>standard</b> <b>coordinates.</b> Experimentation with the software package Regina shows this new algorithm to be extremely fast in practice, improving speed for large cases by factors from thousands up to millions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere are {{two types}} of the {{discontinuity}} of the original Voronoi-based interpolants: one appears on the data sites and the other on the Delaunay spheres. Some techniques are known for reducing the first type of the discontinuity, but not for the second type. This is mainly because the second type of the discontinuity comes from the coordinate systems used for the interpolants. This paper proposes a sequence of new coordinate systems, called the kth-order <b>standard</b> <b>coordinates,</b> for all nonnegative integers k, and shows that the interpolant generated by the kth-order <b>standard</b> <b>coordinates</b> have Ck continuity on the Delaunay spheres. The previously known Voronoi-based interpolants coincide with the cases k= 0 and k= 1. Hence, the standard coordinate systems constructed in this paper can reduce the second type of the discontinuity as much as we want. In addition, this paper derives a formula for the gradient of the <b>standard</b> <b>coordinates...</b>|$|E

This is also used as the height coordinate of horizontal wind velocity with EAR. We applied a second-order inverse distance weighting interpolation (Wilks 2006) to obtain the T profiles on the <b>standard</b> height <b>coordinate.</b> Due to some missing RASS echoes in a single profile, the nearest two RASS data points to the standard height were not always available for the interpolation. Therefore, we restricted the interpolation when the height difference (distance) from the <b>standard</b> <b>coordinate</b> point was within 0.6  km. If the RASS results were missing for longer than this range, we skipped the interpolation. Thus, we obtained the T profiles with the five RASS beams on the same height coordinate.|$|R
