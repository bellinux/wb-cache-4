40|$|Our {{ab initio}} study {{suggests}} that boron segregation to the Sigma 5 (310) [001] grain boundary should strengthen the boundary up to 1. 5 ML coverage (15. 24 at/nm^ 2). The maximal effect is observed at 0. 5 ML and corresponds to boron atoms filling exclusively grain boundary interstices. In copper bulk, B causes significant distortion both in interstitial and regular lattice sites for which boron atoms are either too big or too small. The distortion is compensated to large extent when the interstitial and substitutional boron combine {{together to form a}} strongly bound dumbell.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{perception}} of sound qualities inside railway stations. My purpose is to describe sound qualities or <b>sound</b> <b>failures</b> perceived by users in the aim to create a prediction tool for architects. Sociological, acoustical and architectural surveys {{have been used to}} understand what users feel while taking several walks inside the stations. Sound quality is approached through acoustical criteria measurement and evaluation of subjective listening criteria. This research led surveys in Paris - Gare du Nord, Gare Montparnasse and Gare Haussmann (Eole line). This paper shows how a specific methodology can be used to develop a catalogue which connects spatial forms, sound sources and social practices. As it is impossible to study in situ the same type of architecture in different stations, we choose to study a basic social practice which is common to the three stations : a walk of a person which crosses a station to use another mean of transport - for example, the walk between the suburbs trains platform and the entry of the subway. Several walks in each station have been chosen to value architectural devices, sound sources and social practices that can be observed. The same action was studied (1) at different time in the week -with or without public in the space- (2) in the 2 directions of the walk - go and back - and (3) in the three stations.

It shows as well in which way the same space can create several sound qualities.

40|$|Ceramic matrix {{composites}} {{are being}} developed for elevated-temperature engine applications. A leading material system in this class of materials is silicon carbide (SiC) fiber-reinforced SiC matrix composites. Unfortunately, the nonoxide fibers, matrix, and interphase (boron nitride in this system) can react with oxygen or water vapor in the atmosphere, leading to strength degradation of the composite at elevated temperatures. For this study, constant-load stress-rupture tests were performed in air at temperatures ranging from 815 to 960 C until failure. From these data, predictions {{can be made for}} the useful life of such composites under similar stressed-oxidation conditions. During these experiments, the <b>sounds</b> of <b>failure</b> events (matrix cracking and fiber breaking) were monitored with a modal acoustic emission (AE) analyzer through transducers that were attached at the ends of the tensile bars.

50|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, many of the smaller {{commercial}} banks within New England were easily chartered as laws allowed to do so (primarily due to open franchise laws). The rise of commercial banking saw an increase in opportunities for wealthy individuals to become involved in entrepreneurial projects in which they would not involve themselves without a guaranteed return on their investment. These early banks acted as intermediaries for entrepreneurs who did not have enough wealth to fund their own investment projects and for those who did have wealth but did not want to bear the risk of investing in projects. Thus, this private banking sector witnessed an array of insider lending, due primarily to low bank leverage and an information quality correlation, but many of these banks actually spurred early investment and helped spur many later projects.

40|$|A quantitative, {{comparative}} study {{was made of}} sound produced in vitro by pulsatile flow in and around three designs of prosthetic aortic heart-valves. Designs studied were 25 mm Bjork-Shiley, 24 mm Smeloff and Starr-Edwards model 2400 valves. A digital method {{for the analysis of}} the sounds using the fast Fourier transform is presented and applied. Results are examined in both the time domain and a variety of formats in the frequency domain. Formats include original time vs. amplitude plots, power-density spectra, power-distribution functions, a 3 -D (three-dimensional) surface of power-frequency-time, auxiliary views of these 3 -D surfaces, and a 3 -D, power-distribution surface showing the difference between two 3 -D, power-distribution surfaces. Enhanced distinguishability of sound was clearly shown by the 3 -D, power-difference surface which provided a very convenient means for the overall comparison of two sounds. Attention was given to understanding effects of valvar and pulsatile conditions upon the frequency characteristics of the opening, systolic, and closing <b>sounds.</b> <b>Failure</b> modes were simulated and resulting changes of the sounds were examined. Simulated overgrowth was placed on the inner apical surface of the Starr-Edwards model 2400 valve and on the upstream struts of the Smeloff valve. Results showed that the sounds produced provided information pertinent to the simulated malfunction. Effects of pulse rate, mean flow-rate, and mean aortic pressure associated with the normal valvar sounds were investigated. Results were interpreted in terms of the known physical changes of the valve and known changes of the pulsatile state. Under alternate pulsatile states, the total power of the opening and closing sounds were influenced primarily by the rate of change of the ventricular pressure prior to these events. The difference between systolic sounds was much greater than between opening and closing sounds for cases involving changes of the stroke volume for each normal valve design. An increase in systolic flow rate produced a corresponding increase in the power of peaks in the spectra of the systolic sound for each design. The location of peaks within the power density spectra of opening, systolic and closing sounds were more similar during the studies of alternate, non-normal, pulsatile states of normal valves than they were during the studies of normal/abnormal valves under normal pulsatile states. Visualization of the valve and particle trajectories and simultaneous recording of sound, flow rate, and upstream and downstream pressure, provided direct evidence of the cause of many of the acoustical events. Strouhal numbers were estimated from center-frequencies of resonance peaks associated with sounds that were related to periodic vortex shedding in flows past the struts, annular gaps and phonocatheter. The overall results indicate that the method used could distinguish changes of valvar and pulsatile states for each of the valvar designs that were studied...|$|R

Diaphragmatic hernia may be congenital or acquired {{as a result of}} blunt trauma due to being hit by a car, high-rise syndrome, fighting, dog attacks. It may also be iatrogenic. Clinical signs include respiratory distress, borborygmus over the chest, asymmetrically quiet heart or lung <b>sound</b> and <b>failure</b> to distinguish between organs when the abdomen is palpated. Thoracocentesis and gastrocentesis may be done to relieve the dyspnoea. Immediate surgical correction is needed if the stomach has herniated, the bowel or organs are strangulated, the viscera have ruptured or if there is an inability to oxygenate after medical treatment. A traumatic diaphragmatic hernia is caused by an abrupt increase in intra abdominal pressure due to a forceful blow to the abdominal wall. The lungs then deflate rapidly resulting in a pleuroperitoneal gradient which causes the diaphragm to rupture at its weakest points. Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are due to dysfunctional development during embryogenesis. The defect causing the hernia may arise due to prenatal injury to the septum transversum or faulty development thereof.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} has as {{its central}} focus the concept of amplitude, addressed in a theoretical-practical way. In the theoretical aspect of the work, amplitude in space is approached through the reflections given by Agamben on the "open" in dialogue with Heidegger. Amplitude in time is discussed in the contexto of Bergson's perspective on the "duration", to which I suggest a connection with considerations on "distance" (Rancière), "listening" (Nancy) and "wandering" (Bourriaud). Next, the space {{and the time of}} amplitude become the lead wires for a possible approach to contemporary art status. Through a journey that exposes the current functioning of the arts through the concepts of "post-autonomy" and "imminency" (Canclini) and still makes use of the "contemporary" images provided by Agamben, I attempt to build a brief analysis of the role displacement and wandering have come to occupy in the current "radicant" artistic poetics. I suggest an association between the "semionaut" of Bourriaud and images of the "poet" provided by Agamben and Nancy, articulating the artistic practice simultaneously as a "cannot doing" and as a "re-doing (in) the difficult", and supporting my argument in Rancière and Didi-Huberman. I propose an analysis of these issues concentrated on the work of two migrant artists: Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, with her dystopian mechanism and Francis Alÿs, with his ambulatory procedure for rumors production. The practical part of the dissertation consisted of Amplitude Project (2012 - 2014), composed of three works: the performative action homonymous Amplitude (2012 -), the video installation Commuting (2014) and the <b>sound</b> performance <b>Failure</b> (2014 -).

40|$|Non-local models {{guaranty}} that {{finite element}} computations on strain softening materials remain <b>sound</b> up to <b>failure</b> from a theoretical and computational viewpoint. The non-locality prevents strain localization with zero global dissipation of energy, and consequently finite element calculations converge upon mesh refinements to non-zero width localization zones. One {{of the major}} drawbacks of these models is that the element size {{needed in order to}} capture the localization zone must be smaller than the intemallength. Hence, the total number of degrees of freedom becomes rapidly prohibitive for most engineering applications and there is an obvious need for mesh adaptivity. This paper deals with the application of the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation, well known in hydrodynamics and fluid-structure interaction problems, to transient strain localization in a non-local damageable material. It is shown that the ALE formulation which is employed in large boundary motion problems can also be well suited for non-linear transient analysis of softening materials where localization bands appear. The remeshing strategy is based on the equidistribution of an indicator that quantifies the interelement jump of a selected state variable. Two well known one-dimensional examples illustrate the capabilities of this technique: the first one deals with localization due to a propagating wave in a bar, and the second one studies the wave propagation in a hollow sphere.
