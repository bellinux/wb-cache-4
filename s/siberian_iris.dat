50|$|Crosses {{that are}} between the series Sibericae and the series Californicae are often {{referred}} to as Cal-Sibes. They are generally smaller than typical <b>Siberian</b> <b>iris,</b> but taller than Pacific Coast Irises. They have semi-evergreen foliage, and flowers that are 5 - 7 cm in diameter. They are best grown in rich, well-drained soil in sun or part shade.|$|E

Leaf traits, phenological data, seed-set, thousand-seed weight, germination, growth rate and soil characteristic data are published based on original observations: • Leaf area is between 25, 3 and 52, 9 cm 2, its dry mass is 232 and 272 mg/g, specific leaf area is 14, 5 and 15, 0 m 2 /kg; based on measurement of 5 – 5 leaves of I. sibirica, collected from Tapolca and Létavértes (Hungary) in May of 2014. • Based on herbarium dataset, blooming of I. sibirica begins at the end of April and lasts to early-July, contrary to the literature data (May–June). • Capsules contain (0 –) 58 – 76 (– 121) fertile seeds.

50|$|Iris sibirica, {{commonly}} known as <b>Siberian</b> <b>iris</b> or Siberian flag, is a species in the genus Iris. It is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial, from Europe (including France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Former Yugoslavia, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Ukraine and northern Turkey) and Central Asia (including Armenia, Azerbaijan and Siberia). It has long green grass-like leaves, tall stem, 2-5 violet-blue, to blue, and occasionally white flowers. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions.|$|E

50|$|Since the 1970s, hybridizers {{and plant}} breeders have been cross-pollinating the various {{species in the}} Siberian group with Iris sibirica to create many hybrids. Whose {{parentage}} is now so complicated that the cultivars, are no longer listed with a species name. Several hundred <b>Siberian</b> <b>iris</b> cultivars are registered with the American Iris Society.The flowers of the cultivars varying in colour from white to shades of blue or deep violet-blue.Pale blue forms were originally obtained by crossing the white and the blue varieties of Iris sibirica; it also combines readily with Iris sanguinea to produce hybrids with the taller stems.The flowers of hybrids can have arched, semi-flaring, flaring or overlapped falls; some of them even have ruffled or extra falls. The newer Japanese hybrids, have six pendant falls, which make them similar in appearance to the Japanese Iris or Iris ensata.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This thesis {{stresses}} the importance of the environmental protection. It is important to help the environmental protection by being environmentally friendly, take care of the structure and state of the landscape, respect all the protected areas and thus contribute to the protection of endangered plant and animal species, as well as those that might become endangered in the future. This thesis also covers the characteristics of the localities with incidence of the following endangered species: Corydalis (Corydalis intermedia), True Oxtulip (Primula elaior), <b>Siberian</b> <b>Iris</b> (Iris sibirica) and Marsh Orchid (Dactylorhiza majalis). Additionally, this thesis also covers my own monitoring of the localities with the endangered species of Corydalis (Corydalis intermedia), True Oxlip (Primula elaior) and <b>Siberian</b> <b>Iris</b> (Iris sibirica). Based on literature survey and my own investigation, in the last chapter I propose suitable measures and protection of the monitored plants and localities...|$|E

Found endangered and protected plants were located by GPS receiver and then were focused on the map. On the territory were found these endangered and protected species: Wild Calla (Calla palustri), Martagon (Lilium martagon), Crocus Heuffelianus (Crocus heuffelianus), Europen Misletoe (Viscum album subsp. abietis) and <b>Siberian</b> <b>Iris</b> (Iris sibirica). In the end was described important measure for rescuing these species...|$|E
