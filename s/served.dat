5000|$|Holding <b>serve</b> {{is crucial}} in tennis. To hold <b>serve,</b> <b>serves</b> must be {{accurately}} placed, and a high priority {{should be placed on}} first <b>serve</b> percentage. In addition, the velocity of <b>serve</b> is important. A weak <b>serve</b> can be easily attacked by an aggressive returner. The first ball after the <b>serve</b> is also key. Players should <b>serve</b> {{in order to get a}} weak return and keep the opponent on the defense with that first shot. For example, following a wide <b>serve,</b> it is ideal to hit the opponent's return to the open court.There are three different types of <b>serves</b> and each one of them can be used in different situations. One type of <b>serve</b> is the <b>serve</b> with slice. The slice <b>serve</b> works better when the player tosses the ball to the right and immediately hits the outer-right part of the ball. This <b>serve</b> is best used when you hit it wide so you get your opponent off the court.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyse the successfulness of tactics of <b>serve</b> and <b>serve</b> {{reception}} of the national teams who participated in Pool B of European Men’s Volleyball Championship in 2015. The study included four national teams: Estonia, France, Croatia and Italy. A total of six games and 912 <b>serves</b> were analysed. Data were collected using the statistics program Data Volley 2007. The data were transferred to Microsoft Excel 2010, which was used for data analysis. Additional statistical analysis was performed using the program SPSS Statistics 21. For jump float <b>serve,</b> the most preferable service zone was zone 5. The <b>serves</b> from this zone were also the most dangerous. For power jump <b>serve,</b> the most preferable service zone was zone 1. From this zone the smallest number of faults were made at power jump <b>serve,</b> but also the smallest number of ace <b>serves</b> and <b>serves</b> after which the opponent could not use all attack combinations were performed. Substitute players who came game only to perform <b>serves</b> showed the same efficiency in jump float <b>serve</b> as starting players. Among the performers of power jump <b>serves,</b> the starting players could perform more ace <b>serves,</b> but there were also more <b>serves</b> after which the opponent could use all attack combinations. Thus, the <b>serve</b> efficiency was relatively similar for both types of players. Players using the power jump <b>serve</b> were more likely to earn a point with their first <b>serve</b> than the performers of jump float <b>serve.</b> The likeliness of earning a point with the second consecutive <b>serve</b> increased for players using the jump float <b>serve,</b> but remained the same for performers of power jump <b>serve.</b> At power jump <b>serve,</b> service faults occurred more often after timeout than in play, but good <b>serves</b> were hit equally after timeout and in play. At jump float <b>serve,</b> the number of faults was the same after timeout and in play, but good <b>serves,</b> both aces and <b>serves</b> after which was not possible to use all attack combinations, were more often hit after timeout. Underhand pass was used for receiving float <b>serve</b> almost twice more often than overhand pass, even though the accuracy of the latter was higher...|$|R

50|$|<b>Serve</b> style varies {{drastically}} from {{player to}} player. Generally, they {{are divided into}} two types: offensive and defensive.
