40|$|In {{this paper}} the author gives an {{overview}} of the emergence and evolution of the idea of discharge or modification of contract due to <b>supervening</b> <b>events,</b> from Roman to contemporary law, with special emphasis on the evolution of the doctrine and its development as a legal institution in the European legislation or case law. The institution of changed circumstances (<b>supervening</b> <b>events)</b> allows the discharge or (judicial) modification of a contract in a situation when the performance of an obligation has not become impossible, but it would require unreasonable costs or the performance would be inexpedient, hence it {{is considered one of the}} most striking exceptions to the principle of pacta sunt servanda. It belongs to the group of a very few institutions in relation to which one cannot claim to have direct and clear roots in Roman law. In the works of learned lawyers one may find only sporadic traces of it. In contrast to Roman legal science, Roman philosophy was more favourable to the theory of <b>supervening</b> <b>events,</b> a fact very well proven by the works of Cicero and Seneca. In the late Middle Ages the canonists and, especially, postglossators gave the greatest contribution to the evolution of the theory of <b>supervening</b> <b>events.</b> The school of postglossators considered <b>supervening</b> <b>events</b> a general legal institution, tacitly implied in every legal statement constituting obligation. The ideas of postglossators left a great impact on further evolution of the theory. Even the designation of the institution, clausula rebus sic stantibus, generally accepted in contemporary literature, derives from them. In the period following the postglossators' time, lasting until the end of the 18 th century, there is still an interest in the theory of <b>supervening</b> <b>events</b> in literature. However, under the influence of the school of natural law a somewhat restrictive approach is adopted, in the German doctrine in the first place, according to which the clausula rebus sic stantibus should not be implied in all contracts, but applied exceptionally, if specific conditions are met. The first European civil codes, the Bavarian, Prussian and Austrian, do regulate the effect of <b>supervening</b> <b>events</b> explicitly, in content which is, in general, in line with these theoretical standpoints. It seems that in the 19 th century legal science nearly abandoned the idea of <b>supervening</b> <b>events,</b> which could be considered as a consequence of the inviolable primacy of the tenet of pacta sunt servanda, at the time. In line with that, the most important civil codes of this era, such as the French, German and Swiss did not govern the effect of <b>supervening</b> <b>events</b> as a general legal institution. The institution of <b>supervening</b> <b>events</b> is gradually accepted in the case law after the First World War, while the period after the Second World War is heralded by the tendency of its statutory regulation. The ever-growing number of states that regulated <b>supervening</b> <b>events</b> as a general legal institution of contract law included the former Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, too, as well as the Republic of Serbia and the other states that were once members of the common, South Slavic federal state...|$|R

Consequently, the lower courts rejected Fibrosa's claim to recover the £1,000.|$|E
5000|$|But, when {{negligence}} {{is followed}} by a natural event of such magnitude that it erases the physical effects of the original negligence, the defendant’s liability ceases at the moment in time when the supervening condition occurs. In Carslogie Steamship Co v. Royal Norwegian Government, the Carslogie collided with the Heimgar and admitted liability. Temporary repairs were effected with permanent repairs to be carried out later in the United States. After the collision but before crossing the Atlantic, the Heimgar was given a certificate of seaworthiness, authorising her to be continued in her present class without fresh record of survey, subject to permanent repairs at the owner's convenience. She was held fit to carry dry and perishable cargoes. While crossing the Atlantic, the Heimgar encountered heavy weather and sustained such serious damage as to become unseaworthy and to require immediate dry docking. Thus, prior to encountering the rough weather, the Heimgar was a seaworthy vessel, capable of earning profits for her owners. Repairs due to the collision and to the heavy weather, as well as the owner's repairs were all carried out at the same time. Ten of the fifty days in dry dock were allocated to the repair of the collision damage and the question for the House of Lords was whether the owners of the Carslogie were liable for that ten-day loss of earning capacity. The claim was for damages because a working ship is [...] "a profit-earning machine". If she ceases to earn a profit, it is essential to consider what caused the detention in dry dock at that time. In this case, the Heimgar was a profit-earning vessel before suffering the heavy weather damage. Thus, the loss of earnings at that time was not caused by the collision. Hence, The Oropesa demonstrates that where there are two successive causes of harm, the court may regard the first event as the cause of all the harm, or hold that the second <b>supervening</b> <b>event</b> reduces or eliminates the effect of the initial negligence as in Carslogie Steamship Co v. Royal Norwegian Government.|$|E

40|$|Subsequent to the {{formation}} of a charterparty, extraordinary events might occur. These events may radically and significantly alter the nature of the contractual rights and obligations of the parties. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess legal effects of such <b>supervening</b> <b>events</b> on the performance of contractual obligations. In particular, under English law, the contract may be automatically brought to an end by operation of the doctrine of frustration. Whereas, often, commercial parties reasonably contemplate change of circumstances at the time of the contracting and predetermine legal consequences for these events. This can be achieved through contractual risk allocation clauses, such as force majeure. Therefore, the study analyzed the effect of the contractual force majeure clauses and interrelation of these clauses with the frustration doctrine. The research concluded that by incorporating force majeure clauses, parties can: firstly, avoid the frustration of their contract if such clause fully covers the frustrating event; and secondly, parties can bring their contractual relations to an end in circumstances, which by itself may not be sufficient to bring the doctrine of frustration into operation...|$|R

To avoid the risk of a global version of Japan’s “lost decade”, we suggest banks apply rebus sic stantibus notionally. Negotiated contract modification and balance sheet adjustment, linked by a feedback loop, would maintain value in otherwise “toxic” mortgage-backed securities, mitigate losses, reduce new capital needs, avoid the cost of ever more foreclosures and provide a more focused stimulus to the economy than the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing.

40|$|Change of {{circumstances}} {{and its effect}} on a duration of an obligation In particular cases, an unexpected <b>supervening</b> <b>event</b> may substantially affect original equilibrium of a contract, or make the performance for one of the parties much more burdensome, so that it would be greatly unjust to hold the parties to their obligations.

Pacta sunt servanda, principle accepted by most of developed legal systems, determines that obligations which are validly concluded, must be fulfilled, parties are bound by their agreement.

25|$|A {{contrasting}} {{approach is}} called physicalism. Physicalism is a philosophical theory holding {{that everything that}} exists is no more extensive than its physical properties; that is, {{that there are no}} non-physical substances (for example physically independent minds). Physicalism can be reductive or non-reductive. Reductive physicalism is grounded in the idea that everything in the world can actually be reduced analytically to its fundamental physical, or material, basis. Alternatively, non-reductive physicalism asserts that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: that mental states (such as qualia) are not ontologically reducible to physical states. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not {{rule out the possibility that}} mental states are correlated with neurological states. In one such construction, anomalous monism, mental <b>events</b> <b>supervene</b> on physical <b>events,</b> describing the emergence of mental properties correlated with physical properties - implying causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as property dualism rather than monism, yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states (see epiphenomenalism).|$|R
50|$|This is {{interpreted}} as meaning that mental <b>events</b> <b>supervene</b> upon the physical.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{explores the}} commonalities between the draft Australian Law of Contract (‘ALC’) {{and the general}} rules of {{contract}} law of the Brazilian Civil Code (‘BCC’). This search for commonalities is framed {{in the context of}} legal harmonisation as a phenomenon in various national and transnational agendas of legal reform around the world. This thesis adopts the functional approach to comparative law by looking at how contract rules provide legal solutions to similar legal problems overcoming taxonomic and conceptual barriers between legal traditions and languages. The comparative exercise involves the translation of relevant rules of the BCC from Portuguese into English, a lingua franca, in order to juxtapose them with the ALC rules. This thesis argues that there is a high degree of commonality between the contract law of these two jurisdictions that transcends differences in legal traditions and conceptual architectures. Where similarities are apparent, they are reported {{on the basis of their}} most significant degree of identity; where similarities are hidden, they are presented on the basis of their consistency. Both sets of rules establish the basis of contracts under the principles of good faith and freedom of contract and form, only limited by the concurrence of requirements of existence, legality and public policy. Both sets of rules provide for termination of the contractual relationship on the grounds of breach and <b>supervening</b> <b>events</b> while offering a series of remedies of compensatory and restitutionary nature. Likewise, they provide for substitution of parties to the contractual relationship. In any of these categories, contracts fulfil similar functions despite operating under different taxonomic arrangements and concepts. Evidence of numerous commonalities demonstrates the suitability of the ALC as an instrument for harmonising the contract law of Australia with its trade partners while paving the way towards the formulation of a global law of contract...|$|R

50|$|The non-reductive physicalist is {{committed}} to following three principles: the irreducibility of the mental to the physical, some version of mental-physical supervenience, and the causal efficaciousness of mental states. The problem, according to Kim, is that when these three commitments are combined with a few other well-accepted principles, an inconsistency is generated that entails the causal impotence of mental properties. The first principle, which most ontological physicalists would accept, is the causal closure of the physical domain, according to which, every physical effect has a sufficient physical cause. The second principle Kim notes is that of causal exclusion, which holds that no normal event can {{have more than one}} sufficient cause. The problem is that a behavior cannot have as its cause, both a physical <b>event</b> and a (<b>supervening)</b> mental <b>event,</b> without resulting in a case of overdetermination (thus violating the principle of causal exclusion). The result is that physical causes exclude mental states from causally contributing to the behavior.|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the effects of a {{contract}} of events and circumstances which occurred after the contract was entered into. The study principally examines the application of the English doctrine of frustration with comparative reference to the law applicable in Saudi Arabia. The main objective is to analyse how the English doctrine and its Saudi equivalents can provide an excuse or defence in circumstances where a party is prevented from performing contractual obligations. The study proceeds as follows. First, the doctrine of frustration is described {{in the context of a}} general overview of how a contract might be discharged. The historical development of the doctrine of frustration is then outlined together with its limitation and justifications. The application of the doctrine is then discussed in the most likely circumstances where it would be applied. The next step is to consider the central issue of commercial hardship, specifically whether it is recognised in English and also in Saudi law. Then remedies available when a contract has been frustrated are examined as well as the functionally equivalent rights and liabilities arising under the frustrated contract. The evidence presented to this point is then discussed in relation to the use of force majeure clauses and in particular their relationship with the doctrine of frustration. The study concludes that, while the English doctrine of frustration has witnessed significant developments, since it emerged as a departure from the rule of strict liability, it is still applied within a very narrow remit. Thus, the best way for contracting parties to deal with <b>supervening</b> <b>events</b> is by providing for force majeure clauses. The practical consequence of this is that where reliance upon these clauses becomes increasingly significant, with a consequent lessening of the importance of the ‘default’ rule of the doctrine of frustration. In Saudi Arabia, contract law is heavily reliant on Islamic jurisprudence, which does not have a general theory of impossibility. Instead, the concept of impossibility is drawn from scattered statements and applications in the jurisprudence, which appear broader and so perhaps less rigid than the English doctrine of frustration...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{assessment}} of the position of English, American, French and German law, UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG), the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts and Principle of European Contract Law (PECL) regarding the problem of economic hardship in performance of contracts. As such, it has four aims: first, to establish a comprehensive concept of economic hardship; second, {{on the basis of the}} concept of economic hardship established, to examine this concept in the four main legal systems to determine the extent to which they recognise this problem and what kind of legal consequences they consider for it; third, by a comparative approach, to consider and explore the points of convergence and divergence between the legal systems under study; and, fourth, by examining some international and regional laws and models to find out how non-domestic laws and models have treated the issue. In relation to the first aim, after establishing that a general theory of hardship is needed, it is argued that economic hardship occurs when, as a result of unforeseen and unforeseeable <b>supervening</b> <b>events</b> for which none of the parties is responsible and could not have been avoided the consequences, the performance of the contract has become excessively onerous and the original equilibrium of the contract has been fundamentally altered. In relation to the second aim, different conclusions are reached in the four legal systems being studied: in English law, although the doctrine of frustration by its dominant test of ‘fundamental change’ is theoretically applicable to cases of economic hardship, in practice, English courts have rejected the notion that hardship can be regarded as a ground for excuse for non-performance of the contract. In American law, the modern doctrine of commercial impracticability has recognised the problem of economic hardship. However, in practice American courts have been unsuccessful in properly applying this doctrine to cases of economic changes in contracts. French law has only accepted economic changes as a ground for revision in administrative contracts under the doctrine of imprévision.  The German doctrine of frustration has played a broader function compared to that of other legal systems; German law has recognised the problem of economic hardship as a ground for excuse of non-performance of the contract in its case law and also in its recently revised Civil Code. In relation to the third aim, it is submitted that CISG, an international convention for international sale of goods, has not adopted the concept of economic hardship, and impossibility is the only ground for the exemption rule under Article 79 of CISG. However, the two modern models UNIDROIT Principles and PECL have properly recognised the problem of economic hardship and anticipated appropriate solutions for it. Although the presence of a concept of economic hardship is needed as a general guidance in changed economic circumstances, it is concluded that the most peaceful way to deal with the problem of economic hardship is to provide express causes at the time of conclusion of the contract.

30|$|Although {{aneuploidy}} may {{itself be}} a progenitor of cancer, {{it has been}} widely considered as possible indirect agency in CIN and chromosomal mis-segregation [68]. The connections are not necessarily absolute. It is generally considered {{that it is only}} when genomic instability supervenes that the activation of the cancer phenotype begins [69]. However, this apparent inconsistency can be productively resolved by regarding any cell with any variant karyotype as its own self-referential agency that exists within the context of an extensive cellular ecology in which it must find succor. This is the same milieu that all cells experience. However, when subjected to a triggering event (spontaneous mutation, dysregulatory oncoproteins, or epigenetic impact such as viral/retroviral incursion, a carcinogen, or a mutagen), an ordinarily limited and constrained biological mechanism becomes undisciplined within the cellular matrix within which it arises.

50|$|The {{other major}} {{option is to}} assert that mental events are either (at least contingently) {{identical}} to physical <b>events,</b> or <b>supervene</b> on physical <b>events.</b> Views that fall under this general heading are called physicalism or materialism. But, such views require a particular theory to explain how mental events are physical in nature. One such theory is behaviorism. Behaviorists, in general, argue that mental events are merely dispositions to behave in certain ways. Another theory is the identity theory, according to which mental events are (either type- or token-) identical to physical events. A more recent view, known as functionalism, claims that mental events are individuated (or constituted by) the causal role they play. As such, mental events would fit directly into the causal realm, as they are simply certain causal (or functional) roles. Finally, there is eliminative materialism, which simply denies that there are any such mental events; thus, {{there is really no}} problem of mental causation at all.|$|R
40|$|After {{the seminal}} works of Putnam (1975), Burge (1979), and Kripke (1982), the next {{important}} contribution to externalism is certainly Davidson’s (mainly 1987, 1988, 1989, 2001). By criticizing the posi-tions of these philosophers, Davidson elaborated his own brand of exter-nalism. We shall first present some features of Davidson’s externalism (the importance of historical-causal connections for the foundation of language and thought, for the explanation of how language can be learned, and how attitudes can be identified by the interpreter, and fi-nally how mental content is determined by appealing {{to the idea of}} trian-gulation), to prepare the discussion of a few problems. We then discuss two questions in Davidson’s externalism. First, how to reconcile the fact that external factors determine mental content, as Putnam, Burge and Davidson himself argued convincingly, with token-physicalism, the thesis that mental events are identical with physical events occurring “in the head” (or the thesis that mental <b>events</b> <b>supervenes</b> locally on brain ac-tivities) ? The second main problem is how to reconcile the first person authority with some prima facie consequences of externalism, mainly that we should know the relevant parts of our (natural and social) envi-ronment in order to know the content of our own thoughts? We argue that Davidson’s answer to the first question is not successful, while his answer to the second was a breakthrough...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{obstacle to}} lawhood {{in the special}} sciences is the worry that such laws would require metaphysically extravagant conspiracies among fundamental particles. How, short of conspiracy, is this possible? In this paper we’ll review a number of strategies that allow for the projectibility of special science generalizations without positing outlandish conspiracies: non-Humean pluralism, classical MRL theories of laws, and Albert and Loewer’s theory. After arguing {{that none of the}} above fully succeed, we consider the conspiracy problem through the lens of our preferred view of laws, an elaboration of the MRL view that we call the Better Best System (BBS) theory. BBS offers a picture on which, although all <b>events</b> <b>supervene</b> on a fundamental level, there is no one unique locus of projectibility; rather there are a large number of loci corresponding to the different areas (ecology, economics, solid-state chemistry, etc.) in which there are simple and strong generalizations to be made. While we expect that some amount of conspiracy-fear-inducing special science projectibility is inevitable given BBS, we’ll argue that this is unobjectionable. It follows from BBS that the laws of any particular special or fundamental science amount to a proper subset of the laws. From this vantage point, the existence of projectible special science generalizations not guaranteed by the fundamental laws is not an occasion for conspiracy fantasies, but a predictable fact of life in a complex world...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{immediately}} compelling arguments against the disjunctivist position within the philosophy of perception points to the well-accepted fact that hallucinations can have the same neural cause as veridical perceptions; {{this is known as}} the causal argument. Since the main motivation for disjunctivism is to preserve naive realism, critics claim that naive realism is then incompatible with certain, well-accepted claims of neuropsychology, and, thus, disjunctivism is false. After surveying the general arguments for disjunctivism offered by Hinton, Snowden, and Martin, the causal argument is split into a stronger version and a weaker version. The strong argument relies on a narrow conception of the ‘same cause, same effect’ principle and this narrow conception is extremely controversial, ultimately entailing that mental <b>events</b> <b>supervene</b> only on the total brain state of an individual. The weak argument, which embraces a wider conception of the ‘same cause, same effect’ principle finds the disjunctivist position explanatorily redundant. The two major camps within disjunctivism, positive disjunctivism and negative disjunctivism, offer different approaches to the weak argument, and what emerges from the discussion of these two theories is that negative disjunctivism has a major dialectical advantage against positive disjunctivism, and that negative disjunctivism offers a satisfying response to the weak causal argument. M. G. F. Martin offers an insightful analysis of ‘indistinguishability’ and in doing so clarifies the disjunctivist thesis, sets limits to our understanding of our own mental states, and places the burden with the common-kind theorist...|$|R
40|$|The {{flexibility}} of long-term investment contracts is {{a benefit to}} both an investor and the state for mitigating the effect of an unforeseeable event which negatively impacts on {{the viability of the}} contract. However, the aspect of sanctity of contract has often prompted rigid provisions with the underlying rationale that this gives investors security and predictability. In contrast, by virtue of the principle of fundamental change of circumstances, new trend has come to life in the field of extractive industries consisting of inclusion in the contract a provision that provides for renegotiation or adaptation of the existing agreement. The reasoning behind the adoption technique is that parties should not be obliged to carry on a performance which would be unjustly onerous or fruitless due to a <b>supervening</b> unregulated <b>event.</b> The main criticism of this approach is that the claim for renegotiating an existing agreement which contains no renegotiation clause or insistence on a third party intervention for adapting such a contract amount to an undue interference. However, the manner in which contracts are negotiated in countries that exhibit poor governance or situation of army conflict challenges this view. The question asked is whether an unfair contract concluded with unelected government or leaders of military factions and subject to corruption can be allowed to survive without being revised. The DRC, realizing this problem, undertook to renegotiate some of its mining contracts with specific objectives, such as; investor respect of legislation, use of local resources, social responsibility clauses, and evaluation of the input of the partners taking into account the equity shareholding with the public party holding not less than 51 %. This has resulted in the termination and cancellation of certain contracts. Aggrieved investors filed several proceedings, but they dropped them, privileging an amicable settlement. Besides, the outcome of the renegotiation suggests that Congolese negotiators have not fully achieved the objectives set out {{at the start of the}} process. Against this backdrop, the dissertation found that the Congolese mining sector is governed by a broad range of regulations and corresponding supervisory bodies. Constant suspicions of illegally mining exploitation prevail on the sector as a result of the ill enforcement of the aforesaid regulations, corruption and mismanagement. This study also found that renegotiating an existing agreement is a common practice in commercial contracts. Major systems of law have dealt with when they confronted with the issue related to the non-performance of a contractual obligation. The stability of the contractual terms is must but, at the same time, a certain degree of flexibility is necessary to allow parties to adjust their relationship in case of imperfections, cultural differences or <b>supervening</b> of unforeseen <b>events.</b> However, to be effective, the renegotiation mechanism must be regulated for not fuelling unlimited demand of adaptation, therefore, instability of the contract. The renegotiation of mining contacts in DRC was extremely politicised. However, both investor and Congolese sides have benefited from that differently. The Congolese government gave preference to short-term profits result to the expenses of the long-term improvements. By comparison, the majority of investors have secured their assets. Others have even increased them. An examination of the amended agreement that have been disclosed so far reveals that a lot issues remain unresolved, particularly with regard to the reasons that prompted the renegotiation. Moreover, parties to the aforesaid process did not attempt to regulate future demands of adaptation. Based on these findings, the recommendation of the dissertation is that future mining agreements should include a renegotiation clause and regulate the intervention of a third party. The Congolese government should endeavour to lessen political interference throughout mining contract negotiations. It should also build negotiation skills among its representatives involved in that process. Investors should increase among them awareness of corporate social responsibility standards for preventing illegal exploitation of mining resources which, ultimately, results in triggering unilateral contract adjustment. The remaining issues in connection with the amended agreements should be resolved amicably for this approach is more likely to bring mutual satisfaction to both the Congolese state and investors.

In that circumstance, since aneuploidy is common, cancer might be considered an aberrant attempt at repair from that epigenetic stress. In this frame, microenvironmental stress is the precipitating cause rather than an effect of oncogenesis. Under such conditions, the effect of an activating microenvironmental stress becomes a crucial trigger. For example, the result of that stress could be the expression of latent genomic inclusions (retroelements, ERVs) that can reside in the central genome. It can be considered that such an entity could act in a fashion similar to other cryptic pathobionts [113]. Under typical circumstances, these cryptic genetic elements might exist in apparent harmony within a tissue ecology. Even further, any might be in temporary service to its localized tissue ecology until a critical stressing <b>event</b> <b>supervenes.</b> Given the known association of cancer with some viruses, a critical trigger might be a viral incursion that might be context dependent. It has recently been found that such viral incursions can have a wide range of unanticipated effects. Not all of these are disadvantageous. Chénard et al. [114] report the viral donation of an immunity system into a freshwater filamentous cyanobacterium (Nostoc sp.) to encode a functional CRISPR array and a proteobacterial DNA polymerase. Viral incursion might therefore facilitate CIN by contributing to the ambiguous immunological status of infected cells, permitting CIN to be tolerated rather than expunged. At an initial stage, a virus or viral component might act as a typical communal pathobiont, but still triggering aneuploidy and genomic instability that is not initially connected to recognizable pathological outcomes. A subsequent event might be the further required trigger that leads to neoplastic dissemination. This would account for the variable latency typical of some cancers. For example, an epiphenomenon might trigger previously incorporated latent intra-genomic retroelements that had been down regulated and had remained quiescent. Such complex inter-reactions between genomes, endogenous retrovirus activation, and the microbiome within tissue ecologies are in fact known [115].|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{obstacle to}} lawhood {{in the special}} sciences is the worry that such laws would require metaphysically extravagant conspiracies among fundamental particles. If, for example, Malthus's Law of ecology really is a law, and if the rabbits whose reproduction rates it describes in some way supervene on more fundamental kinds, then it can seem highly mysterious that the fundamental rabbit-constituting objects end up moving, projectibly, in ways consistent with Malthus's Law. How, short of conspiracy, is this possible? In this paper we'll review a number of strategies for solving the conspiracy problem [...] - i. e., for allowing for the projectibility of special science generalizations without positing outlandish conspiracies. Some of these strategies turn on accepting accounts of laws (e. g., non-Humean pluralist and classical MRL theories) on which the problem of conspiracy cannot arise in the first place. Alas, we'll argue, these accounts do less than we should want a theory of laws to do, and so should be rejected. Next we'll take on a recent strategy, due to Albert and Loewer, that aims to solve the conspiracy problem by treating special science regularities as probabilistic corrolaries of statistical postulates over low-level initial conditions. We'll argue that, while this view may obviate conspiracy, it rests on unrealistic and insufficiently general assumptions about the relation between special and fundamental sciences. Finally, we'll consider the conspiracy problem {{through the lens of}} our preferred view of laws, an elaboration of the MRL view that we call the Better Best System (BBS) theory. BBS offers a picture on which, although all <b>events</b> <b>supervene</b> on a fundamental level, there is no one unique locus of projectibility; rather there are a large number of loci corresponding to the different areas (ecology, economics, solid-state chemistry, etc.) in which there are simple and strong generalizations to be made. While we expect that some amount of conspiracy-fear-inducing special science projectibility is inevitable given BBS, we'll argue that this is unobjectionable. It follows from BBS that the laws of any particular special or fundamental science amount to a proper subset of the laws. From this vantage point, the existence of projectible special science generalizations not guaranteed by the fundamental laws is not an occasion for conspiracy fantasies, but a predictable fact of life in a complex world...|$|R
