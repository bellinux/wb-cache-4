5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} {{produces}} aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, {{which is important}} in the regulation of salt ("mineral") balance and blood volume. In the kidneys, aldosterone acts on the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire <b>sodium</b> <b>content</b> in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates. Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Angiotensin II and extracellular potassium are the two main regulators of aldosterone production. The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences blood pressure. Therefore, the effects of aldosterone in sodium retention are important for the regulation of blood pressure.|$|E

Seedlings at 7 th leaf stage grown in culture solution {{were subjected to}} saline water(100 mM sodium chloride) and transpired for 12 hours. Various transpiration rates were obtained under different humidity, light intensity and temperature conditions. Transpiration stream concentration factor of Na+ (TSCFNa+), which denotes the sodium exclusion rate in the root, decreased with increase in the transpiration rate under different humidity and light intensity conditions. On the other hand, TSCFNa+ was lower in KR 1 than in IR 28 under different temperature conditions. There were no different in the sodium exclusion rates at high transpiration rates. <b>Sodium</b> <b>contents</b> of tops initially increased with the transpiration rates but afterwards decreased with the transpiration rates. <b>Sodium</b> <b>contents</b> of tops were higher in KR 1 than in IR 28 at low transpiration rates under high humidity and low light intensity conditions, but it was higher in IR 28 under low temperature conditions. There were no varietal differences in the <b>sodium</b> <b>contents</b> of tops at high transpiration rates. These {{results indicated that the}} varietal differences in sodium exclusion rates were detectable at low transpiration rates and affected the <b>sodium</b> <b>contents</b> of tops, but there were no differences in the <b>sodium</b> <b>contents</b> of tops at high transpiration rates. イネでは、ナトリウム（Na) 含有率が高いほど光合成速度、苗の生存率および相対生長速度が低下することから、塩ストレス下における体内Na含有率の品種間差異に着目した研究が進められてきた。しかし、塩ストレスに対する体内Na含有率の品種による反応は、研究によって異なる。Makiharaらは、幼苗期にNa含有率が異なるとされる品種を成熟まで栽培したところ、Na含有率に大きな差異を見出さなかった。また、Makiharaらの研究でNa含有率が低かった品種が、森田らの研究では高かった。イネは、根においてナトリウムイオン（Na+）を分離排除する能力をもし、その程度は品種によって異なる。この能力は体内に入り込む水のNa+濃度に影響を与えるのが、体内に取り込まれるNa+の質は、流れる水の総量に影響される。すなわち、イネのNa含有率は、蒸散量と蒸散流に含まれるNa+濃度によって決まり、後者は根におけるNa+排除率によって変わる。蒸散と排除率はいずれも環境条件によって変わると考えられ、それによって体内Na含有率も変わるであろう。したがって、研究によってNa含有率の反応が異なるのは、両者の相互作用によると考えられえる。しかし、蒸散量とNa+排除率の変化が体内Na含有率にどのように影響を与えるのかは知られていないので、本研究で調べた...|$|R

5|$|The {{skin of a}} teleost {{is largely}} {{impermeable}} to water, and the main interface between the fish's body and its surroundings is the gills. In freshwater, teleost fish gain water across their gills by osmosis, while in seawater they lose it. Similarly, salts diffuse outwards across the gills in freshwater and inwards in salt water. The European flounder spends most of its life in the sea but often migrates into estuaries and rivers. In the sea in one hour, it can gain Na+ ions equivalent to forty percent of its total free <b>sodium</b> <b>content,</b> with 75 percent of this entering through the gills and the remainder through drinking. By contrast, in rivers there is an exchange of just {{two percent of the}} body Na+ content per hour. As well as being able to selectively limit salt and water exchanged by diffusion, there is an active mechanism across the gills for the elimination of salt in sea water and its uptake in fresh water.|$|E
5|$|Potash is {{primarily}} a mixture of potassium salts because plants {{have little or no}} <b>sodium</b> <b>content,</b> and the rest of a plant's major mineral content consists of calcium salts of relatively low solubility in water. While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did not include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789. For a long time the only significant applications for potash were the production of glass, bleach, soap and gunpowder as potassium nitrate. Potassium soaps from animal fats and vegetable oils were especially prized because they tend to be more water-soluble and of softer texture, and are therefore known as soft soaps. The discovery by Justus Liebig in 1840 that potassium is a necessary element for plants and that most types of soil lack potassium caused a steep rise in demand for potassium salts. Wood-ash from fir trees was initially used as a potassium salt source for fertilizer, but, with the discovery in 1868 of mineral deposits containing potassium chloride near Staßfurt, Germany, the production of potassium-containing fertilizers began at an industrial scale. Other potash deposits were discovered, and by the 1960s Canada became the dominant producer.|$|E

To the tea, three pounds of calcium oxide (or seven pounds when the operation is performed in winter), nine pounds of sea salt, and seven pounds of ash from burned oak is mixed into a smooth paste. While wearing gloves to prevent the chemicals from burning the skin, each egg is individually covered by hand, then rolled in a mass of rice chaff to keep the eggs from adhering to one another before they are placed in cloth-covered jars or tightly woven baskets. The mud slowly dries and hardens into a crust over several months, and then the eggs are ready for consumption.|$|E
25|$|The Ochoa Point Member is {{interpreted}} to have accumulated {{as the result}} of continued tidal-flat sedimentation. The lower part of this member appears to have accumulated in the higher mud flat position of the tidal flat environment where periodic desiccation occurred. The upper part of this member is inferred to have accumulated in the deeper, or more seaward part of the tidal-flat environment. At the time that these tidal flats were covered by the initial eruption of the Cardenas Basalt, the eastern grand Canyon region was at or very near sea level. Features found in the lowermost part of the Cardenas Basalt indicate that the basaltic lavas outpoured over unconsolidated sandy and silty Dox sediments at the time they were wet. It is unknown whether these sediments were slightly above or slightly below water level at the time they were buried by lava. The high proportion of altered glass in and the pervasive fracturing (hyaloclastite) of the basal Cardenas Basalt support this interpretation. The high <b>sodium</b> <b>content</b> of the basal Cardenas Basalt indicates spilitization due to reaction with hypersaline water. Hematitic alteration of the sediment that resulted from baking by the lavas is minimal, amounting to a few centimeters or less.|$|E
