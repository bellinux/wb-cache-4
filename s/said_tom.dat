When shooting started, the horse that Tom McLaury held jumped to one side. Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw {{his hand to his}} right hip. Virgil <b>said</b> <b>Tom</b> followed the horse's movement, hiding behind it, and fired once or twice over the horse's back.|$|E
25|$|With Lord Fitzwilliam, in Grosvenor Square, for {{the purpose}} of {{discussing}} the subject of a coalition with him, and of endeavouring to prevail on him to speak to Fox—Lord Fitzwilliam's sentiments perfectly right—he said his opposition never had been to the constitution of the country, but to the Government when it acted in a way he thought contrary to the constitution; that, therefore, when that was in danger he ceased to be in opposition. On going over the matter it became evident that the great obstacle would arise from Fox's being too much entangled with Grey, Lambton, and that set of men who had lately separated themselves from the party, in order to form a party of their own, and who publicly professed doctrines and opinions in direct opposition to what he and I considered to be for the good and welfare of the public. That this would indeed be very hard and unreasonable, that for the sake of these very men, who both in their public and private capacity had been as inimical as possible, an arrangement should be broken off so salutary and so advisable. Lord Fitzwilliani and myself agreed on every point; he, however, went beyond me in insisting on the indispensable necessity of Pitt resigning the Treasury for another Cabinet office. He acquiesced in the wisdom of trying to bring Fox to be less attached to these false friends, and <b>said</b> <b>Tom</b> Grenville was the best man to speak to him. Lord Fitzwilliam expressed his dislike to Sheridan, said he might have a lucrative place, but never could be admitted to one of trust and confidence. On my wishing him not to leave town, he said he could safely trust his conscience with the Duke of Portland, and was at the same time ready to return at the shortest notice.|$|E
500|$|The series' writing style, {{which was}} {{sometimes}} adverb heavy, suggested {{a name for}} a type of adverbial pun promulgated during the 1950s and 1960s, a type of wellerism known as [...] "Tom Swifties". Originally this kind of pun was called a [...] "Tom Swiftly" [...] {{in reference to the}} adverbial usage, but over time has come to be called a [...] "Tom Swifty." [...] Some examples are: [...] "'I lost my crutches,' <b>said</b> <b>Tom</b> lamely"; and [...] "'I'll take the prisoner downstairs', <b>said</b> <b>Tom</b> condescendingly." ...|$|E

500|$|Atlantis SquarePantis {{was written}} by {{longtime}} SpongeBob SquarePants writers, Casey Alexander, Zeus Cervas, Steven Banks, and Dani Michaeli, and the animation was directed by Andrew Overtoom. Although it was promoted by Nickelodeon as the first made-for-television film of the series, Atlantis SquarePantis is an extended episode, running 45 minutes. [...] " [...] an adventurous quest kind of a story," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Tom</b> Kenny, the voice of SpongeBob, [...] "about SpongeBob and his friends journeying and discovering the lost continent of Atlantis, which is ruled by a character voiced by David Bowie." ...|$|E
500|$|The Creek Turnpike {{was opposed}} by area {{residents}} from its conception. Forming {{a group called}} [...] "Tulsans Against Turnpikes", around 220 citizens gathered at a meeting on February 16, 1989, to discuss the proposed toll road. Opponents to the turnpike cited detrimental effects to their community and to the environment as their concerns. [...] "What I am concerned about is that it changes the complexion of south Tulsa. It {{would no longer be}} a residential area," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Tom</b> Taylor, an area resident. Some residents also complained that the proposed turnpike would mainly serve through traffic, despite OTA estimates that south Tulsa residents would make up 90% of the road's userbase.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce said [...] "94 Meetings" [...] was a {{particularly}} strong episode that focused equally on the show's premise and developing the relationships between characters. He particularly praised Susan Yeagley, but <b>said</b> <b>Tom</b> Haverford was underused, and felt the scenes between Ann and Mark were lacking. New York magazine writer Steve Kandell {{said it was a}} fast-paced and funny episode, calling the jokes about the complaining residents [...] "rapid-fire scenes". Kandell criticized Mark, who he said has been resorted to boring [...] "straight-man services", and said he did not mind that Paul Schneider was leaving the series. Kona Gallagher of TV Squad appreciated that the episode reintroduced the fact that Leslie once was in love with Mark, and criticized the show for ignoring that fact all season. Gallagher also criticized the fact that a historic building could so easily be damaged and demolished, which he called unrealistic.|$|E

500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{called it}} a [...] "particularly strong" [...] episode that used all of the {{characters}} well. Fowler especially liked that although Ron and Leslie bickered throughout the episode, they still displayed a mutual respect for each other. He also said Tom's photography sessions were {{a good way to}} display Ann and Mark's deteriorating relationship. The A.V. Club writer Steve Heisler said [...] "Summer Catalog" [...] laid the foundation for several future developments, like changes to the Andy/April and Mark/Ann relationships, but also kept the episode funny and enjoyable. Heisler <b>said</b> <b>Tom</b> had the best lines of the episode. Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said she was saddened by the decline in Mark and Ann's relationship and the setback for the April and Andy courtship, and feared the subplot might not reach a satisfactory conclusion {{by the end of the}} season. Gallagher also said the mainplot with Leslie and the former park heads was predictable, and that guest star Michael Gross was underused.|$|E
500|$|The Milton Keynes {{idea was}} very poorly {{received}} by Luton fans and viewed, in Bale's words, as [...] "tearing the club from its most loyal supporters". Luton fans held protest marches and rallies throughout the 1983–84 season, and chartered {{a plane to}} fly over Kenilworth Road during one match pulling a banner reading [...] "Keep Luton Town F.C. in Luton". Some 18,000 Luton residents signed a petition against the club leaving. A consortium of local businessmen attempted to persuade Vauxhall Motors, General Motors' Luton-based British marque, {{to invest in the}} club and help with a new stadium in Luton. In Milton Keynes, some residents expressed fears that Luton's arrival in central Milton Keynes might bring with it football hooliganism and threaten local amenities. Some Luton supporters boycotted the club's first home match of the 1984–85 season in protest against the Milton Keynes plans. The wide unpopularity of the proposed move and the consistently vehement opposition from Luton's local support combined to prevent it from occurring. [...] "The directors want our support and our money," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Tom</b> Hunt, a member of a Luton fans' action group against the move, [...] "but they ignore the views of a community that wants to keep its football club. Why should fans pay at the turnstiles to help the club in business {{so that it can be}} taken away from us?" ...|$|E
500|$|The fear in of {{the fourth}} floor refers to tetraphobia, the superstitious fear of the number four. Jokes about this have been {{featured}} in such pop culture works as the 1999 film Being John Malkovich and the NBC comedy series 30 Rock. The song [...] "Unskinny Bop", a 1990 single by the band Poison, plays {{during one of the}} strip club scenes. Leslie <b>said</b> <b>Tom</b> hides his emotions behind [...] "a very thick layer of Axe body spray", a reference to the real-life male grooming product. The Parks department employees eat at a restaurant called Jurassic Fork, a reference to the Steven Spielberg dinosaur adventure film Jurassic Park, which was adapted from a novel of the same name by Michael Crichton. During one scene, Tom refers to Ron as [...] "Rondoleezza Rice", a reference to former United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. At the strip club, Leslie mistakenly refers to a stripper named Sierra by the name Seabiscuit, a champion thoroughbred racehorse. Reflecting on his marriage, Tom said, [...] "At least we lasted longer than Avril Lavigne and that guy from Sum 41", a reference to the pop singer's short-lived marriage to Sum 41 guitarist Deryck Whibley. Tom says one of the strippers also works at Quiznos, a sandwich fast-food franchise; Tom says of her: [...] "She's really nice to me here, but really mean to me at Quiznos." [...] Andy said he has a T-shirt that is [...] "literally priceless" [...] because he was wearing it when he tackled American singer Eddie Vedder. When Ron was commenting on how well Tom was pretending to be sad about his divorce, he tells Tom, [...] "Take it down a notch.

2500|$|The Secret Service {{says it does}} {{establish}} 'public viewing areas' {{to protect}} dignitaries but does not discriminate against individuals based {{on the content of}} their signs or speech. 'Absolutely not,' <b>said</b> <b>Tom</b> Mazur, a spokesman for the agency created to protect the president. 'The Secret Service makes no distinction on the purpose, message or intent of any individual or group.' Civil libertarians dispute that. They cite a Corpus Christi, Texas, couple, Jeff and Nicole Rank, as an example. The two were arrested at a Bush campaign event in Charleston, West Virginia, on July 4, 2004, when they refused to take off anti-Bush shirts. Their shirts read, 'Love America, Hate Bush'... The ACLU found 17 cases since March 2001 in which protesters were removed during events where the president or vice president appeared. And lawyers say it's an increasing trend.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of June 9, 2008, a [...] portion of County Highway A that {{traverses}} {{the north side of}} Lake Delton failed, creating a new drainage channel to the Wisconsin River. At 2 am that day, [...] of rain caused one hundred residents to start sandbagging. The lake waters overflowed County Highway A about a quarter mile from the dam, and most of the lake emptied in two hours. The water began overflowing at approximately 10 am. As the water overtopped the isthmus, it flowed downhill to the Wisconsin River approximately [...] away, quickly eroding and creating a [...] channel that rapidly drained the lake in an out-of-control torrent into the river, [...] below the lake's level. Three homes washed away, and another two were destroyed when their foundations were undermined by the new outflow. The sediments {{at the bottom of the}} lake were visible.
