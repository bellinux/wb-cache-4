60|$|I {{knew that}} he was in labor with another of those winks of his, though I could not see his face, because he was bent down at work; and wishing him a safe delivery, I turned to and helped the rest get out the mail-sacks. It made a great pyramid by the {{roadside}} when it was all out. When they had mended the thoroughbrace we filled the two boots again, but put no mail on top, and only half as much inside as there was before. The conductor bent all the <b>seat-backs</b> down, and then filled the coach just half full of mail-bags from end to end. We objected loudly to this, for it left us no seats. But the conductor was wiser than we, and said a bed was better than seats, and moreover, this plan would protect his thoroughbraces. We never wanted any seats after that. The lazy bed was infinitely preferable. I had many an exciting day, subsequently, lying on it reading the statutes and the dictionary, and wondering how the characters would turn out.|$|E
60|$|He went early, {{and found}} himself in the end seat of a long row of many rows of women, who were prolonging the time of keeping their hats on till custom obliged them to take them off. He gave so much notice to the woman next him as to see that she was deeply veiled as well as widely hatted, and then he lapsed into a dreary muse, which was broken by the first strains of the overture. Then he {{diverted}} himself by looking round at all those ranks of women lifting their arms to take out them hat-pins and dropping them to pin their hats to the <b>seat-backs</b> in front of them, or to secure them somehow in their laps. Upon the whole, he thought the manoeuvre graceful and pleasing; he imagined a consolation in it for the women, who, if they were forced by public opinion to put off their charming hats, would know how charmingly they did it. Each turned a little, either her body or her head, and looked in any case {{out of the corner of}} her eyes; and he was phrasing it all for a scene in his story, when he looked round at his neighbor to see how she had managed, or was managing, with her veil. At the same moment she looked at him, and their eyes met.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} <b>seat-back</b> angle and {{accelerometer}} height at the <b>seat-back</b> on <b>seat-back</b> x-axis frequency-weighted root-mean-square (r. m. s.) acceleration {{have been investigated}} in field experiments. Experiment 1 investigated the range and variability, of frequency-weighted r. m. s. acceleration at the same measurement position, where the <b>seat-back</b> angle was 24 degrees from vertical {{on the floor and}} the accelerometer height was 38 cm up from the seat cushion surface. Experiment 2 investigated ranges of frequency-weighted r. m. s. acceleration between the reference position, which was the position used in experiment 1, and test positions at different <b>seat-back</b> angles, 4 degrees ahead of and 4 degrees behind the reference position. Experiment 3 investigated the range of frequency-weighted r. m. s. acceleration between the reference position which was the same as in experiments 1 and experiment 2, and test positions at different accelerometer heights at the <b>seat-back</b> from a seat cushion surface, 2. 5 cm higher, 2. 5 cm lower and 5 cm lower than the reference position. This investigation clarifies that different <b>seat-back</b> angles and accelerometer heights at the <b>seat-back</b> affect the frequency-weighted r. m. s. acceleration at these measurement positions, which is beyond the exposure values at which people are able to distinguish different vibration acceleration magnitudes...|$|R

40|$|The present work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} neck injuries following rear-end car collisions. Biomechanics and sites of the injuries have been investigated. A new dummy neck has been developed and used to study the influence of different seat properties on occupant kinematics. Anaesthetised pigs were exposed to swift extension-flexion motions of the cervical spine. Pressure pulses in {{the central nervous system}} with magnitudes of up to about 150 mmHg (2. 0 kPa) were registered during these neck motions. These pressure magnitudes seem to depend on the velocity and direction of the angular motion between adjacent vertebrae. Evans Blue dye conjugated to albumin was injected into the blood system and injuries to the spinal ganglia, particularly in the lower cervical region were found at histopathological examination. These injuries could explain many of the symptoms that are typical for patients with an AIS 1 neck injury sustained in rear-end collisions. The measured pressures are believed to be a possible cause of these injuries. In order to enable better assessment of the neck motion during staged rear-end collisions at low impact-velocities (A Hybrid III-dummy equipped with the new dummy-neck was used in two series of rear-end collision sled tests at 5 km/h and 12. 5 km/h pre-impact sled-velocity. In the first series, five types of front-seats (bucket seats) and three types of rear-seats from passenger cars were tested. Seemingly similar seats displayed large differences as to the head-neck kinematics. In the second series, one of the front-seats was modified and tested again. A head-restraint with a flat vertical front surface and with its top well above the level of the head centre of gravity was attached to the <b>seat-back.</b> Two different head to head-restraint gaps were tested in combination with different stiffnesses of the <b>seat-back</b> frame and the lower <b>seat-back</b> cushion as well as different depths of the upper <b>seat-back</b> cushion. The horizontal head to head-restraint gap proved to have the largest influence on the head-neck motion during the impact. The maximum head-torso displacement increased with increasing head to head-restraint gap. An increased stiffness of the <b>seat-back</b> frame resulted in slightly increased maximum head-torso displacement, but in combination with a stiffening of the lower <b>seat-back</b> cushion and deeper upper <b>seat-back</b> cushion, the result was a clear reduction of the head-torso displacement. The results indicate that minor changes to existing car-seats might radically improve the protection against neck injuries in rear-end collisions...|$|R

There was space for four people, {{although the two}} in the back would have found their head room rather restricted. The sales material of the time makes much of the car's passive safety features, such as the two spoke steering wheel with a recessed central hub, rounded door handles and a lock on the front <b>seat-backs</b> {{to prevent them from}} tilting forwards unexpectedly. The padded dashboard and interior window frames were also unusual, and the claim can certainly be made that in terms of secondary safety (US English: [...] "crashworthiness") the Lloyd Arabella marked a step forward for cars of this class. [...] The spare wheel was stowed below the rear luggage compartment. It was stowed externally which meant it could be accessed without having to empty out the luggage locker.|$|E
50|$|The 43 bhp, 948 cc OHV engine (coded 9CC) {{was derived}} from the Austin A35 and Morris Minor 1000 models, also BMC products, but {{upgraded}} with twin 1 inch SU carburettors. The rack and pinion steering {{was derived from}} the Morris Minor 1000 and the front suspension from the Austin A35. The front suspension was a coil spring and wishbone arrangement, with the arm of the Armstrong lever shock absorber serving as the top suspension link. The rear axle was both located and sprung by quarter-elliptic leaf springs, again with lever-arm shock absorbers and top links. There were no exterior door handles; the driver and passenger were required to reach inside to open the door. There was also no boot lid, owing to the need to retain as much structural integrity as possible, and access to the spare wheel and luggage compartment was achieved by tilting the <b>seat-backs</b> forward and reaching under the rear deck, a process likened to potholing by many owners, but which resulted in a large space available to store soft baggage.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 The {{transfer}} of air travelers with disabilities between a mobility aid and an aircraft seat {{is a major}} source of injury for both the travelers and the airline personnel assisting in the transfer. The risk to both parties might be reduced through the biomechanical study of the transfer task. Such study requires that the contact forces acting on the body of the rear transferor be known, including the contact force between the rear transferor and the <b>seat-back.</b> A <b>seat-back</b> mounted force plate was designed and constructed to accurately measure the magnitude and the center of pressure location of normal forces applied to the <b>seat-back.</b> This force plate collects data from four preloaded single component force transducers.

50|$|SAHR {{is mounted}} {{at the top}} of a frame, inside the <b>seat-back,</b> which is {{designed}} to pivot at its mid point. In a rear-end impact, the occupant’s lower back is forced rearwards by inertia against the bottom portion of the <b>seat-back.</b> A mechanical linkage in the frame then forces the upper half, carrying the head restraint, upwards and forwards to catch the occupant’s head and help minimise the amount of whiplash movement.The Benefit of the SAHR's system is that the headrest doesn't require replacement once used, unlike BMW and Volvo's WHIPS systems.|$|R
