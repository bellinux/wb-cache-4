The isolated human HEV sequences were analyzed phylogenetically. RESULTS: The positive rate of serum HEV RNA were 21. 0 % (13 / 62), including 5 cases of liver failure.

2500|$|<b>Sporadic</b> <b>E</b> (Es) {{propagation}} can {{be observed}} on HF and VHF bands. [...] It must {{not be confused with}} ordinary HF E-layer propagation. Sporadic-E at mid-latitudes occurs mostly during summer season, from May to August in the northern hemisphere and from November to February in the southern hemisphere. There is no single cause for this mysterious propagation mode. The reflection takes place in a thin sheet of ionisation around 90km height. The ionisation patches drift westwards at speeds of few hundred km per hour. There is a weak periodicity noted during the season and typically Es is observed on 1 to 3 successive days and remains absent for a few days to reoccur again. Es do not occur during small hours; the events usually begin at dawn, and there is a peak in the afternoon and a second peak in the evening. Es propagation is usually gone by local midnight.|$|E

The mean age was 32. 8 ± 11. 3 years (range: 11 - 64 years). There were 2 children. The mean serum bilirubin level was 8 ± 7. 1 mg/dL. Mean ALT and AST levels were 596. 7 8 ± 498. 7 and 672. 5 ± 522. 9 IU/L respectively. Serum ALP levels were 410. 8 ± 312. 5 IU/L.

The maximum persistence of IgM anti HEV was 45 days. Amongst 48 patients 2 females (non-pregnant) died due to fulminant hepatic failure.

How to control the nosocomial ESBL-E transmission {{is a matter of}} debate. Contact isolation of patients has been recommended but evidence supporting it in non-outbreak settings has been inconclusive. Methods We used stochastic transmission models to analyze retrospective observational data from a two-phase intervention in a pediatric ward, successively implementing single-room isolation and patient cohorting in an isolation ward, combined with active ESBL-E screening. Results For both periods, model estimates suggested reduced transmission from isolated/cohorted patients. However, most of the incidence originated from <b>sporadic</b> sources (i. <b>e.</b> independent of cross-transmission), unaffected by the isolation measures. When sporadic sources are high, our model predicted that even substantial efforts to prevent transmission from carriers would have limited impact on ESBL-E rates. Conclusions Our results provide evidence that, considering the importance of <b>sporadic</b> acquisition, <b>e.</b> g. endogenous selection of resistant strains following antibiotic treatment, contact-isolation measures alone might not suffice to control ESBL-E. They also support the view that estimating cross-transmission extent is key to predicting the relative success of contact-isolation measures. Mathematical models could prove useful for those estimations and guide decisions concerning the most effective control strategy...|$|R

In this study, the prevalence of HEV infection in Sudan was investigated in 432 patients with acute hepatitis from 12 localities in North Kordofan, and from 152 patients involved in smaller outbreaks of hepatitis in the neighbouring Darfur. HEV infection was diagnosed in 147 (25 %) patients: 98 from Kordofan and 49 from Darfur. The mortality was 10 %; six of the patients who died from the infection were pregnant women. HEV RNA was detected by quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR) in 38 (26 %) patients: 22 from Kordofan and 16 from Darfur. Partial open reading frame (ORF) 1 and ORF 2 were sequenced from HEV from nine and three patients, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Sudanese strains belonged to genotype 1 (HEV 1), and confirmed the segregation of African HEV 1 strains into one branch divergent from Asian HEV 1. It also revealed that the Sudanese strains from this study and from an outbreak in 2004 formed a separate clade with a common ancestor, distinct from strains from the neighbouring Chad and Egypt.
