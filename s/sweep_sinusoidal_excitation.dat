40|$|Vibrothermography is {{an active}} thermographic {{technique}} able to detect singularities like delamination in composite materials. Carbon fibre laminates are increasingly used, especially in aviation industry where defect detection {{is directly related to}} safety. Physical causes of the internal heating mechanism linked to defect interaction with the elastic waves may be friction, viscoelastic hysteresis or plasticity. The method can efficiently detect flaws on complex geometries and only requires that both internal faces or edges are free to vibrate. The purpose of this work is to determine the relation between the observed heating right above a delamination by an IR camera and the frequency of a sinusoidal excitation between 8 and 27 kHz. The results clearly show specific heating peaks at certain frequencies. The comparison with local resonance frequencies of the delamination computed by simplified FEM shows similarities with the appearance of heating peaks. An experimental study having as goal to exploit the presence of those peaks and thus to increase the sensitivity of the method shows the interest for a high <b>sweep</b> <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>excitation</b> of the chirp type. The final objective of this research is to set up a serviceable short and reliable vibrothermographic test for non-destructive testing of composite materials. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – To {{provide a}} {{reliable}} numerical technique {{for the time}} integration of the electromagnetic models with <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>excitation.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The numerical integration of an electrotechnical problem is commonly carried out using adaptive time stepping. For one particular selected time step, Runge-Kutta (RK) adaptive integration methods deliver two approximations to the solution with different order of approximation. The difference between both is used to estimate the local error.

Moreover, the proposed P-I model is developed to describe hysteresis nonlinearity under triangular excitation by introducing weighted functions, i. e., Λi. Finally, the model results attained under the sinusoidal and triangular inputs at different frequencies are compared with the corresponding experimental data.
