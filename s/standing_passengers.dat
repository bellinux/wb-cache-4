5|$|A mock-up was {{manufactured}} in Japan after Kawasaki won the contract. It was shipped to Singapore {{and put on}} public display during the 1984 National Exhibition held in November 1984 at World Trade Centre. The mock-up featured three choices of seating arrangements and colour schemes; {{members of the public}} were invited to give feedback on these options. The finalised interior design of the C151 trains consisted of a fully longitudinal seating arrangement. The bucket seats were made of plastic; glass partitions separated the seating areas from the passenger doors. Strap lines for <b>standing</b> <b>passengers</b> were installed in the middle of every car. The colour scheme of each adjacent car's interior is distinct to make car identification in cases of fault reporting easier for passengers. Originally the colour scheme of the driving trailer cars was orange, that of the second and fifth motor cars was blue, and that of the two centre motor cars was green. There were nine seats between two doors; this was reduced to seven after the first round of refurbishment.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} interior layout {{with a separate}} conductor and driver the HM V trams had capacity of 29 seated passengers and 69 <b>standing</b> <b>passengers.</b> During the rush hour this could be exceeded by an additional 50 <b>standing</b> <b>passengers.</b> On conversion to one-person operation during the late 1970s and early 80s, the conductor's seat was replaced with two additional seats, bringing the seating capacity up to 31, while the standing capacity was downsized to 57 plus an additional 44 during the rush hour. Following conversion into the Spårakoff, tram number 175 (ex-15) has a capacity of 24 all-seated passengers.|$|E
25|$|The Leyland Lion was out-shopped from Hawke Brothers, who {{had built}} the body, in 1978. It was {{designed}} to accommodate both seated and <b>standing</b> <b>passengers</b> and was fitted out for the Airport service, to which it was initially assigned.|$|E
50|$|The limited-use, limited-application (LU/LA) {{elevator}} is {{a special}} purpose passenger elevator used infrequently, and which is exempt from many commercial regulations and accommodations. For example, a LU/LA is primarily meant to be handicapped accessible, and there might only be room for a single wheelchair and a <b>standing</b> <b>passenger.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Showgrounds station {{opened on}} 2 October 1954 {{on the north}} side of the Ashton Avenue road bridge. It consisted of two 180 metre platforms with free <b>standing</b> <b>passenger</b> shelters and small administration/storage rooms for staff operating the station during Perth Royal Show week. The construction was part of the conversion of Perth's passenger train system from steam to diesel power, allowing smaller intervals between stations.|$|R
40|$|<b>Standing</b> <b>passenger</b> {{safety is}} {{currently}} a major challenge {{for the development of}} public transportation. One of the current difficulties to overcome this problem is the lack of knowledge about the motion of passengers following a minor incident, such as an emergency braking or a slight collision. This study brings new experimental data about the head kinematics of volunteers in situations representative of typical public transportation incidents. Two levels of perturbation were tested - an emergency braking and a minor collision, combined with three initial postures - freestanding, using a backrest, and holding a vertical bar. Data were obtained for (1) the three-dimensional head trajectories; (2) the maximal excursions of the head along the longitudinal axis; and (3) corridors of the head tangential velocity versus its longitudinal displacement. Even though there are limitations, these data {{can be used as a}} first estimate to predict the risks of impact between the head of passengers and their surrounding environment. They also provide insight into the impact velocity of this eventual collision. Furthermore, they highlight the influence of the level of perturbation and of the restraint device possibly used. These data are mainly intended to be used by designers of public transportation vehicles to improve the future interior layouts with regard to the <b>standing</b> <b>passenger</b> safety...|$|R
25|$|The {{majority}} of services run with two LRVs coupled together. The Eurotram {{consists of four}} main compartments, two in each carriage linked by short corridors, and also features an articulation between the two carriages. They have a capacity of 80 seated and 134 <b>standing</b> <b>passengers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Besides the gripman, each {{cable car}} carries a {{conductor}} {{whose job is}} to collect fares, manage the boarding and exiting of passengers, and control the rear wheel brakes when descending hills. With the common practice of carrying <b>standing</b> <b>passengers</b> on the running boards of cable cars, passenger management is an important task.|$|E
25|$|Chevrolet started {{manufacturing}} a {{truck chassis}} adaptable to passenger transport. By the 1930s {{the size of}} the colectivo had increased from five to up to a dozen seats, and the Chevrolet line had become widely used, with bodies made by local companies. This style was kept until the 1970s and 1980s, by which time the units had twenty seats plus cramped room for many <b>standing</b> <b>passengers.</b>|$|E
40|$|Public {{transport}} is {{a potentially}} {{important part of}} independent living for older people, but they are over-represented in non-collision bus injuries. This paper reports on a computational modelling approach to addressing this problem: the Madymo human model validated for simulating passive, seated vehicle occupants was adapted to simulate a <b>standing</b> <b>passenger</b> in an accelerating bus. The force/deformation characteristics of the bus were measured and the human model was expanded to include a validated active hand grip. Real world urban bus acceleration profiles were measured and used as inputs for the simulations. Balance loss could not be predicted, but injuries from contact with the vehicle floor following a fall were evaluated...|$|R

25|$|Two Leyland Cubs were {{purchased}} in 1984 {{for the price}} of one standard-sized bus to provide much needed additional capacity. They, like the Lion before them, were designed to accommodate both seated and <b>standing</b> <b>passengers</b> and were assembled by Modern Motor Bodies Limited. They were evaluated to find the most suitable duties for them, and were found to be most useful on routes where the operation of a full-sized bus was difficult or only light loadings were expected.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{extensive}} {{reach across}} the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, and its intensive use by the local urban population, the Mumbai Suburban Railway suffers {{from some of the}} most severe overcrowding in the world. Over 4,500 passengers are packed into a 9-car rake during peak hours, as against the rated carrying capacity of 1,700. This has resulted in what is known as Super-Dense Crush Load of 14 to 16 <b>standing</b> <b>passengers</b> per square metre of floor space.|$|E
25|$|No. 670, while {{introducing}} {{a number of}} innovations that would later become standard, was not authorised to carry <b>standing</b> <b>passengers,</b> and thus lacked the necessary capacity for use on busy suburban routes. It {{was to have been}} deployed on a Rangiora service for which its generous luggage accommodation would be useful, but deregulation resulted in the license for the Rangiora service being awarded to another operator before no. 670 was delivered. Consequently, it was never used in revenue service, and was sold after being used for a series of demonstration trips.|$|E
50|$|Aside from Mason, the {{supporting}} cast was drawn largely from Dublin's Abbey Theatre. Among {{the other members}} of the Organisation are Cyril Cusack, Robert Beatty, and Dan O'Herlihy. On his travels, Johnny meets an opportunistic bird-fancier played by F. J. McCormick, a drunken artist played by Robert Newton, a barman (William Hartnell) and a failed surgeon (Elwyn Brook-Jones). Denis O'Dea is the Inspector on Johnny's trail, and Kathleen Ryan, in her first feature film, plays the woman who loves Johnny. Also of note are W. G. Fay—a founder of the Abbey Theatre—as the kindly Father Tom, Fay Compton, Joseph Tomelty, and Eddie Byrne. Albert Sharpe plays a bus conductor. A number of non-speaking parts were filled by actors who later went on to achieve a modicum of fame, including Dora Bryan, Geoffrey Keen, Noel Purcell, Guy Rolfe and Wilfrid Brambell (a <b>standing</b> <b>passenger</b> in the tram scene). Few of the main actors in the film actually manage an authentic Ulster accent.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} innovative aspects in {{the development}} of regional travel models for both Sydney and Los Angeles. The overall approach was to incorporate the effects of capacity, crowding, and delayed vehicle arrivals in the network supply, mode choice, and assignment modules. Capacity and crowding modules were first developed and applied in Sydney. The Los Angeles effort has built upon that work and will also consider variations in vehicle arrivals. Most travel models ignore the fact that transit vehicles have limited capacity. The most behaviorally realistic way to implement this feature was through extra weight functions applied at the boarding station. A method was also developed to take into account crowding as a negative factor in the user perception of transit service quality. The work revealed that the probability of having a seat should be reflected in the segment in-vehicle time weight. There is a strong indication, from existing research and the Stated Preference surveys undertaken in Sydney, that in-vehicle time for a <b>standing</b> <b>passenger</b> should be weighted more onerously compared to a seating passenger...|$|R
30|$|The second design {{scenario}} {{presented a}} very versatile {{design in the}} form of a configurable carriage concept, allowing the internal design to be used for freight and passenger service with quick changes. Three designs were proposed for this scenario, in which Design 2.1 was selected as the highest performing design. This was due to the space that was made available by using the foldable, longitudinal seating. This design acts as the final recommendation due to its advantages in many areas with only minor changes to the carriage interior. Design 2.2 provided an alternative folding seat design, allowing transverse seating arrangements to be folded away to the side of the carriage. Both these designs created large amounts of space in the centre of the carriage. This addition of space would benefit the passenger service by allowing the seats to be folded away during extremely busy times such as after a concert or football game. Design 2.1 proved to be the best solution for this scenario as the longitudinal seating arrangement was more desirable for an interior layout due to the reduction in dwell time in peak hours and increase in <b>standing</b> <b>passenger</b> capacity.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} Tōkaidō Shinkansen, {{connecting the}} largest cities of Tokyo and Osaka, is the world's busiest high-speed rail line. Carrying 151 million passengers per year (March 2008), and at over 5billion total passengers it has transported more passengers {{than any other}} high-speed line in the world. The service on the line operates much larger trains and at higher frequency than most other high speed lines in the world. At peak times, the line carries up to thirteen trains per hour in each direction with sixteen cars each (1,323-seat capacity and occasionally additional <b>standing</b> <b>passengers)</b> with a minimum headway of three minutes between trains.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, NSB {{announced}} {{that they would be}} rebranding their services, and that commuter trains would be branded at NSB Puls. They would lose their traditional red color and instead be colored green and silver, with the Class 72 being the first trains to receive the new design. In February 2001, the first train arrived to Norway for testing. The delay was caused by errors in the drawings and the bankruptcy of a supplier. In April it was {{announced that}} the trains were too heavy to allow <b>standing</b> <b>passengers,</b> since the trains could then exceed the permitted axle weight. To reduce the weight, the trains needed to have some steel parts replaced with aluminium. NSB stated that the situation was problematic both because they had calculated the need for standing places to handle rush-hour traffic, and because it was impossible for them to control if more people than there were seats for would board a train. NSB stated that part of the problem was that they could not order shelf ware, in part because the Norwegian loading gauge is wider than in Continental Europe. By September, a solution had been found whereby the weight had been reduced sufficiently that 350 <b>standing</b> <b>passengers</b> could be taken on each train. The trains were delivered with the train radio system Scanet, but the technology was so out of date that there was only a five-year warranty. At the time, it was uncertain when Global System for Mobile Communications – Railway (GSM-R) would be built for the Norwegian rail network, and NSB feared there could arise {{a situation in which the}} trains could not be used, if the construction were not accelerated.|$|E
25|$|Since 26 September 2012 all {{services}} {{have been provided}} by eight-car S Stock trains introduced in July 2010 to replace the 1960s A Stock. Part of Bombardier's Movia family, they have air-conditioning, feasible because the sub-surface tunnels, unlike tube tunnels, are able to disperse the exhausted hot air. They have regenerative brakes, returning around 20% of their energy to the network and thus reducing energy consumption. They have fewer seats— 306 compared with 448 in the older A Stock— but accommodate 697 <b>standing</b> <b>passengers</b> compared with 597 in A Stock and have dedicated space for wheelchairs. It has {{a top speed of}} , and is the only train on the London Underground that can travel at that speed, through the long distance sections north from Finchley Road.|$|E
50|$|On 16 March 1976, {{the station}} {{was the site of}} a Provisional IRA bombing, when a device {{exploded}} on an empty train as it prepared to enter the reversing siding, before heading west to pick up football supporters at Arsenal. There was one <b>passenger</b> <b>standing</b> on the platform and was injured by flying glass.|$|R
5|$|These {{fears were}} to prove {{justified}} as, during the line's {{first month of}} operation, {{there were a number}} of well-publicised problems ranging from overcrowding resulting in <b>passengers</b> <b>standing</b> for the whole journey to timekeeping difficulties due to excessive dwell times at stations. Furthermore, signalling problems led to disruption on the line nearly a month after opening.|$|R
25|$|The metro, {{like the}} {{commuter}} railroads in the region, is electrified at 1500 volts OHLE. Each train has sixteen 180 kilowatt motors; together that yields 2880 kilowatts per train unit. The maximum speed is 80 kilometers per hour. A train can carry 712 people, with 144 seated and 568 standing (based upon six <b>passengers</b> <b>standing</b> per square meter).|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} is clearly one {{designed for a}} mainline train; {{there are only a}} few poles for <b>standing</b> <b>passengers,</b> mostly located around the doors and closely integrated into the train’s overall design. There are no advertisements on board the trains despite the available space on what are in fact plastic covers over what traditionally would be overhead storage areas; viewable through the slats from below. These areas were presumably cordoned off in order to reduce litter and to improve safety however this often means more cramped quarters, especially during peak travel times. Although the trains consist of three carriages, they are connected such that it is possible to walk from one end to the other; the only noticeable divisions between the carriages are a short articulated section in the walls and a slight ramp over the dividing line. The trains have low floors, but the half-carriages at the ends of the trains have high floors with several steps up, to provide room for under-floor motors. The doors into the cabs are clear, allowing passengers to see in, but some drivers prefer to pull curtains across.|$|E
500|$|The trams are bi-directional, [...] {{long and}} with low-floor access to meet UK Rail Vehicle Access Regulations for {{disabled}} people. Each tram has {{a capacity of}} 250, allowing for 78 seated and 170 <b>standing</b> <b>passengers</b> and 2 wheelchairs.|$|E

The inclined elevators were less expensive than vertically-traveling elevators, and were installed within the large escalator shaft at 34th Street. However, as the incline elevators had originally failed a factory test by its manufacturer Maspero Elevatori, there were multiple delays in opening the station, and the opening date was eventually delayed from December 2013 to late 2014, then to mid-2015.|$|E
