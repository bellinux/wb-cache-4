These clamps (which may be operated by many different mechanical means) allow workpieces to be easily placed in the machine or removed, and yet stay secure during operation. Many are also adjustable, allowing for workpieces of different sizes to be used for different operations. Fixtures must be designed such that the pressure or motion of the machining operation (usually known as the feed) is directed primarily against the <b>solid</b> <b>component</b> of the fixture. This reduces the likelihood that the fixture will fail, interrupting the operation and potentially causing damage to infrastructure, components, or operators.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} software in segmenting ground-glass and <b>solid</b> <b>components</b> of subsolid nodules in pulmonary adenocarcinomas. METHOD: Seventy-three pulmonary adenocarcinomas manifesting as subsolid nodules were included. Two radiologists measured the maximal axial diameter of the ground-glass components on lung windows {{and that of the}} <b>solid</b> <b>components</b> on lung and mediastinal windows. Nodules were segmented using software by applying five (- 850 HU to - 650 HU) and nine (- 130 HU to - 500 HU) attenuation thresholds. We compared the manual and software measurements of ground-glass and <b>solid</b> <b>components</b> with pathology measurements of tumour and invasive components. RESULTS: Segmentation of ground-glass components at a threshold of - 750 HU yielded mean differences of + 0. 06 mm (p = 0. 83, 95 % limits of agreement, 4. 51 to 4. 67) and - 2. 32 mm (p < 0. 001, - 8. 27 to 3. 63) when compared with pathology and manual measurements, respectively. For <b>solid</b> <b>components,</b> mean differences between the software (at - 350 HU) and pathology measurements and between the manual (lung and mediastinal windows) and pathology measurements were - 0. 12 mm (p = 0. 74, - 5. 73 to 5. 55]), 0. 15 mm (p = 0. 73, - 6. 92 to 7. 22), and - 1. 14 mm (p < 0. 001, - 7. 93 to 5. 64), respectively. CONCLUSION: Software segmentation of ground-glass and <b>solid</b> <b>components</b> in subsolid nodules showed no significant difference with pathology. KEY POINTS: * Software can effectively segment ground-glass and <b>solid</b> <b>components</b> in subsolid nodules. * Software measurements show no significant difference with pathology measurements. * Manual measurements are more accurate on lung windows than on mediastinal windows...|$|R

5000|$|The thermoacoustic engine (TAE) is {{a device}} that {{converts}} heat energy into work {{in the form of}} acoustic energy. A thermoacoustic engine operates using the effects that arise from the resonance of a standing-wave in a gas. A standing-wave thermoacoustic engine typically has a thermoacoustic element called the [...] "stack". A stack is a <b>solid</b> <b>component</b> with pores that allow the operating gas fluid to oscillate while in contact with the solid walls. The oscillation of the gas is accompanied with the change of its temperature. Due to the introduction of solid walls into the oscillating gas, the plate modifies the original, unperturbed temperature oscillations in both magnitude and phase for the gas about a thermal penetration depth δ=√(2k/ω) away from the plate, where k is the thermal diffusivity of the gas and ω=2πf is the angular frequency of the wave. Thermal penetration depth is defined as the distance that heat can diffuse though the gas during a time 1/ω. In air oscillating at 1000 Hz, the thermal penetration depth is about 0.1 mm. Standing-wave TAE must be supplied with the necessary heat to maintain the temperature gradient on the stack. This is done by two heat exchangers {{on both sides of the}} stack.|$|E

Methods:Fifty-nine subsolid nodules in 58 patients were evaluated. The maximum diameters of subsolid nodules and the <b>solid</b> <b>component</b> on CT were measured by two radiologists in three-dimensional (3 D) and two-dimensional (2 D) planes using in-house software. In addition, the maximum diameters of the tumor and invasive component were measured on pathology by two pathologists. CT measurements were compared with pathologic measurements. Results:There was a strong correlation between the size of the <b>solid</b> <b>component</b> on CT and invasive component on pathology, as well as the size of subsolid nodules and the tumor size (r = 0. 82 – 0. 87 for 3 D measurement, 0. 72 – 0. 88 for 2 D measurement; p < 0. 0001). The size of subsolid nodules in 3 D and 2 D measurements was significantly larger than tumor size (p < 0. 0001). In regard to measurement of the <b>solid</b> <b>component,</b> 3 D measurements tended to be larger than the size of the invasive component whereas 2 D measurement tended to be similar {{to the size of the}} invasive component.
