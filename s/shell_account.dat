50|$|Shell {{accounts}} normally only {{allow the}} use of command line or text-based software, but by logging into a <b>shell</b> <b>account</b> and running Slirp on the remote server, a user can transform their <b>shell</b> <b>account</b> into a SLIP/PPP connection, allowing them to run any TCP/IP-based application - including standard GUI software such as the formerly popular Netscape Navigator - on their computer. This was especially useful in the 1990s because simple shell accounts were less expensive and/or more widely available than full SLIP/PPP accounts.|$|E

50|$|A <b>shell</b> <b>account</b> is a {{user account}} {{on a remote}} server, {{traditionally}} running under the Unix operating system, which gives access to a shell via a command-line interface protocol such as telnet or SSH.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shell</b> <b>accounts</b> {{were made}} first {{accessible}} to interested {{members of the}} public by Internet Service Providers (such as Netcom (USA), Panix, The World and Digex), although in rare instances individuals had access to <b>shell</b> <b>accounts</b> through their employer or university. They were used for file storage, web space, email accounts, newsgroup access and software development.|$|R
50|$|Shell {{providers}} are often found to offer <b>shell</b> <b>accounts</b> at low-cost or free. These <b>shell</b> <b>accounts</b> generally provide users {{with access to}} various software and services including compilers, IRC clients, background processes, FTP, text editors (such as nano) and email clients (such as pine). Some shell providers may also allow tunneling of traffic to bypass corporate firewalls.|$|R

50|$|The Internet Adapter (TIA) was {{software}} {{created by}} Cyberspace Development in 1993 to allow SLIP connections over a <b>shell</b> <b>account.</b> PPP was added in 1995, {{by which time}} the software was marketed and sold by Intermind of Seattle. Shell accounts normally only allow the use of command line or text-based software, but by logging into a <b>shell</b> <b>account</b> and starting the TIA daemon, a user could then run any TCP/IP-based application, including standard GUI software such as the then-popular Netscape Navigator on their computer. This was especially useful at the time because simple shell accounts were much less expensive than full SLIP/PPP accounts. TIA was ported to {{a large number of}} unix or unix-like systems.|$|E
5000|$|... webcron is {{the term}} for a {{time-based}} job scheduler hosted on a web server. The name derives its roots from the phrase web server and the Unix daemon cron. A webcron solution enables users to schedule jobs to run within the web server environment on a web host that does not offer a <b>shell</b> <b>account</b> or other means of scheduling jobs.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike a true SLIP/PPP connection, {{provided}} by a dedicated server, a Slirp connection does not strictly obey the principle of end-to-end connectivity envisioned by the Internet Protocol suite. The remote end of the connection, running on the <b>shell</b> <b>account,</b> cannot allocate a new IP address and route traffic to it. [...] Thus the local computer cannot accept arbitrary incoming connections, although Slirp can use port forwarding to accept incoming traffic for specific ports.|$|E

50|$|Telehack is {{a virtual}} museum that allows one {{to see what the}} Internet was like in the 1980s, when young hackers were {{browsing}} through different bulletin board systems and <b>shell</b> <b>accounts.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1990s, {{numerous}} universities provided dial-up shell accounts (to their faculty, staff, and students). These command line-only connections {{became more}} versatile with SLIP/PPP, enabling {{the use of}} arbitrary TCP/IP-based applications. Many guides to using university dial-up connections with Slirp were published online (e.g. http://www.wam.umd.edu/~toh/SLiRPMacPPP.html, http://fig.cox.miami.edu/Faculty/Tom/Newsletter/SLIRP.html, http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~dave/work/win95.html, http://www.businesslab.mtsu.edu/Lab/tectrain/slirp_w95.htm). Use of TCP/IP emulations software like Slirp, and its commercial competitor TIA was banned by some <b>shell</b> <b>account</b> providers, who believed its users violated their terms of service or consumed too much bandwidth.|$|E
50|$|ProTERM is a {{terminal}} emulator and modem {{program for the}} Apple II and Macintosh lines of personal computers, published by Intrec Software. Most popular in the late 1980s and 1990s, it was most commonly used for calling bulletin board systems (BBSes) via a computer's modem, experienced users could also Telenet into Unix Server_(computing) and Shell_account thereon and FTP and tuneling to various destinations therefrom, and once logged into a Unix <b>Shell</b> <b>account,</b> other forms of telecom all across the Pre-Web Internet; Via VT-100 Terminal Emulator or ANSI_art, this later ushered in Graphics to the scene.|$|E
50|$|Slirp (sometimes {{capitalized}} SLiRP) is {{a software}} program that emulates a PPP, SLIP, or CSLIP connection to the Internet via a <b>shell</b> <b>account.</b> It is largely obsolete for its original purpose, as dedicated dial-up PPP connections and broadband Internet access have in turn become widely available and inexpensive. It remains useful for connecting mobile devices, such as PDAs, via their serial ports. Another significant current use-case is firewall piercing/port forwarding, which is typically but not necessarily done by way of an SSH connection on which port forwarding is restricted.|$|E
5000|$|WWA offered <b>shell</b> <b>accounts</b> from inception, {{starting}} {{out as the}} Gagme Public Access UNIX (pubnix) system originally operated by Greg Gulik. Gagme subscriber accounts were served up on a Linux machine named gagme, while the news server was named serveme, while a third machine (whyme) {{was more or less}} the personal server for Lily Moy, the future Mrs. Greg Gulik. WWA's <b>shell</b> <b>accounts</b> landed a user on his or her [...] "home" [...] server, one of four BSD/OS Intel machines: sake, sashimi, miso, and shoga. As late as 1998, WWA support knew of at least one customer still using a Commodore 64 machine to dial in.|$|R
50|$|Other {{methods can}} be used to take over a channel, though they are {{unrelated}} to flaws in IRC itself; for example, cracking the computers of channel operators, compromising channel bot <b>shell</b> <b>accounts,</b> or obtaining services passwords through social engineering.|$|R
50|$|The {{most visible}} {{application}} of the protocol is for access to <b>shell</b> <b>accounts</b> on Unix-like operating systems, but it sees some limited use on Windows as well. In 2015, Microsoft announced that they would include native support for SSH in a future release.|$|R
5000|$|Sensing {{the promise}} of the Internet, Mahoney built Internet {{functionality}} into the Exec-PC BBS in 1994. When calling into certain numbers known as [...] "gold nodes," [...] the BBS member was connected to an Internet <b>shell</b> <b>account</b> on servers run by IBM's VNET division. This solution quickly proved to be slow and confusing to members, so Mahoney set up a separate division of the company that same year to provide dialup access via both shell accounts and Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). Unlike the BBS, ExecPC Internet provided service exclusively to individuals in Wisconsin and northern Illinois.|$|E

The album includes I Have the Password to Your <b>Shell</b> <b>Account</b> (which received some circulation on the Internet), [...] "Studio Hair Gel", [...] "Robot Trouble" [...] and [...] "Kasey Keller", an ode to the American soccer player. [...] "Studio Hair Gel" [...] and [...] "Robot Trouble" [...] were both released as singles prior to the album and included remixes by Figurine, Dntel and Baxendale. The band toured again {{in the fall of}} 2000 on ZOI, and the album was well received.|$|E
50|$|Many web hosts offer shell {{accounts}} or {{some sort}} of built-in job scheduler such as cron that makes it easy for users to schedule jobs. Such hosts run jobs as command-line applications that may optionally communicate with the web server. A webcron solution, however, runs entirely within the purview of the web server environment of a web host. This allows a webcron solution to operate on hosts that do not offer a job scheduler such as cron or a <b>shell</b> <b>account.</b> A webcron solution will also run equally well on hosts that do offer users such capabilities but is designed as a substitution or replacement.|$|E
50|$|Eventually, however, an {{increased}} use of firewalls, a decreasing usage of the <b>shell</b> <b>accounts</b> required to run a server {{or most of the}} clients, and a lack of FSP support in web browsers caused its use to taper off, and the warez scene moved to HTTP and FXP while pornography moved to publicly advertised web servers.|$|R

50|$|It was {{established}} in 1988 by Bob Rieger, an information systems engineer for Lockheed and Bill Gitow of System V. Netcom started off in San Jose, California as a service to allow local students to access university networks off-campus. The original accounts were all dialup <b>shell</b> <b>accounts</b> on Intel 80386 Tandy PCs running Xenix, with email addresses in the format of user@netcom.com. Netcom soon served 95% of the San Francisco Bay Area.|$|R
50|$|The {{campaign}} {{was developed in}} the late 1960s for Shell by the advertising firm of Ogilvy & Mather, a relationship that would continue for nearly four decades. Print ads addressed other oil uses, such as touting the benefits of switching to an oil-powered hot water heater and encouraging those using oil to heat their homes to ensure they have enough oil in their tank before the cold weather arrives. By the time Shell ended the relationship in 1999, Ogilvy & Mather had 60 employees based in Houston, Texas largely dedicated to the <b>Shell</b> <b>account,</b> and when O&M closed the office in Houston it dropped other local accounts that it could no longer justify supporting.|$|E
5000|$|SlipKnot {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} World Wide Web browsers, available to Microsoft Windows users between November 1994 and January 1998. It was created by Peter Brooks of MicroMind, Inc. to provide a fully graphical view of the web for users without a SLIP or other TCP/IP connection to the net, hence the name - SLIP...not. SlipKnot provided a graphical web experience through what would otherwise be a text-only Unix <b>shell</b> <b>account.</b> SlipKnot version 1.0 was released on November 22, 1994, approximately 3 weeks before Netscape's Netscape Navigator version 1.0 came out. It was designed to serve a significant fraction of PC/Windows-based Internet users who could not use Mosaic or Netscape at that time. (Internet Explorer was released in the following year after SlipKnot, in August 1995.) ...|$|E
50|$|His {{first job}} in 1957 {{was as a}} trainee at Shell Oil, based in their London office. It was there that he {{discovered}} {{that he was more}} interested in advertising than oil and he wrote to David Ogilvy, the head of the advertising agency that had the <b>Shell</b> <b>account</b> at that time, asking for a job. Ogilvy offered him a job as a junior account executive but Mayle's interest was more on the creative side of the business and he subsequently became a copywriter in 1961 based in their New York office. In due course another agency, Papert Koenig, Lois, poached him from Ogilvy and sent him back to London to head up the creative team in their UK office, where one of his colleagues was Alan Parker. When the US parent hit trouble in the mid-60s he and a colleague bought the London operation. They developed the business with accounts that included Watneys, Olivetti and Sony and after five years, they were bought by BBDO, one of the top American agencies. He then commuted between the US and the UK as their creative director. By 1974 he had had enough of advertising and transatlantic commuting and quit the business to write full-time.|$|E

Naa Govindasamy was a {{lecturer}} at the National Institute of Education, who worked to develop the Singapore 16 bit Unicode system which uses Tamilnet and Tamilfix fonts and enables a user to input Tamil in all three computer platforms - Windows, Mac and Unix. These fonts enable a user to read emails and web pages in Tamil on a terminal with only a <b>shell</b> <b>account.</b> [...] Amongst his other achievements, Govindasamy contributed to the development of Tamil literature in Singapore. He made significant contributions, specifically the creation of several plays, dramas and short stories for radio and television. Among the plays, two proved to be very popular, namely Anbukku Apaal and Alaigal Oyvathillai. He also published {{a collection of short stories}} entitled Thedi, for which he received the National Book Development Council’s award in 1992. In 1977 in Singapore, he initiated the Ilakkiya Kalam (Literary Critics' Circle) which gathered and analysed the best stories of the period and subsequently a collection of the best short stories of 1977 was published in 1981. He also published a novelette, Velvi. In 1994, he was awarded the S.E.A. Write Award.|$|E

50|$|The way {{the atomic}} radius varies with {{increasing}} atomic number {{can be explained}} by the arrangement of electrons in shells of fixed capacity. The shells are generally filled in order of increasing radius, since the negatively charged electrons are attracted by the positively charged protons in the nucleus. As the atomic number increases along each row of the periodic table, the additional electrons go into the same outermost shell; whose radius gradually contracts, due to the increasing nuclear charge. In a noble gas, the outermost shell is completely filled; therefore, the additional electron of next alkali metal will go into the next outer <b>shell,</b> <b>accounting</b> for the sudden increase in the atomic radius.|$|R
