5|$|Mobile phones {{have had}} a {{significant}} impact on telephone networks. Mobile phone <b>subscriptions</b> now outnumber fixed-line <b>subscriptions</b> in many markets. Sales of mobile phones in 2005 totalled 816.6 million with that figure being almost equally shared amongst the markets of Asia/Pacific (204 m), Western Europe (164 m), CEMEA (Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa) (153.5 m), North America (148 m) and Latin America (102 m). In terms of new <b>subscriptions</b> over the five years from 1999, Africa has outpaced other markets with 58.2% growth. Increasingly these phones are being serviced by systems where the voice content is transmitted digitally such as GSM or W-CDMA with many markets choosing to deprecate analog systems such as AMPS.|$|E

5000|$|The {{issue which}} makes one <b>subscription</b> system a {{hijacking}} {{of the credit}} card is not the mode of entry into the <b>subscription</b> nor the billing interval, but the marketing organization creating barriers for the user to easily cancel the <b>subscription.</b> Organizations which use credit card hijacking {{as part of their}} marketing strategy make online registration for the <b>subscription</b> easy, enforce default automatic renewal policies, and create barriers to halting the <b>subscription.</b> (This is in contrast to traditional <b>subscription</b> based system such as paper magazines where the subscriber has to periodically proactively reauthorize the <b>subscription,</b> hence the default is to not renew.) The most common <b>subscription</b> exit barrier is to not provide any online <b>subscription</b> cancellation mechanism at all, but to instead require the user to cancel by telephone or by [...] "on-line chats". Such organizations often add the additional barrier of making any <b>subscription</b> cancellation information difficult for the user to even find, thus creating an additional delay in the <b>subscription</b> cancellation. This is very common amongst ISP’s, who know the psychological barrier to making the call, which the subscriber anticipates will be unpleasant, is very high. It also allows the marketing organization to talk the subscriber into changing their minds and not cancelling the <b>subscription.</b> Another common <b>subscription</b> cancellation barrier is to have a relatively long <b>subscription</b> period, a no refund policy, and to require the user upon cancellation to forfeit all money covering the present <b>subscription</b> period. This is very common amongst online dating services.|$|R

5|$|In May 2010, a bug was {{discovered}} by İnci Sözlük that could allow a Twitter user to force others to follow them without the other users' consent or knowledge.

50|$|Like other DVRs, ReplayTV {{allows users}} to record {{television}} programs. The <b>subscription</b> service was operated on a monthly fee, or one time payment, lifetime <b>subscription.</b> Each individual unit required a separate <b>subscription.</b> Older units, like the 2000 and 3000 series, did not require monthly <b>subscription</b> fees, and those units that are still in operation continue to receive programming data without a <b>subscription</b> until July 31, 2011. The price of the original ReplayTV units was higher than comparable TiVo units by approximately the same amount as TiVo's lifetime <b>subscription,</b> so a lifetime <b>subscription</b> was essentially priced into the units.|$|R
