5|$|As {{a result}} of outgassing, comets leave in their wake a trail of solid debris too large to be swept away by {{radiation}} pressure and the solar wind. If the Earth's orbit sends it though that debris, there {{are likely to be}} meteor showers as Earth passes through. The Perseid meteor shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle. Halley's Comet {{is the source of the}} Orionid <b>shower</b> <b>in</b> October.|$|E
5|$|Advance Wars: Days of Ruin was {{intended}} to have a darker atmosphere and more serious tone {{in contrast to the}} previous installments in the series, and features a new storyline independent of the previous games. Set amidst a post-apocalyptic world, the story focuses on the Rubinelle 12th Battalion, one of the surviving remnants of the military of the country of Rubinelle, which had been locked in a century-long war with its rival, Lazuria, prior to a devastating global meteor <b>shower.</b> <b>In</b> the aftermath, the Battalion devotes itself to saving any other survivors of the disaster, despite the shattered nations renewing their war against each other and an uncurable disease ravaging both sides. Meanwhile, a mysterious faction with unknown motives takes advantage of the destruction and pushes both sides deeper into conflict from behind the scenes.|$|E

5|$|Clark Kent first {{appears in}} the pilot episode of Smallville as a teen with superhuman {{abilities}} that he uses to help others. Clark is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schneider and Annette O'Toole) as an infant, when he crash lands on Earth {{on the day of}} the Smallville meteor <b>shower</b> <b>in</b> 1989. Twelve years later, trying to find his place in life after being told he is an alien by his adoptive father, Clark saves the life of Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), the son of billionaire Lionel Luthor (John Glover), and the pair become quick friends. During season one, Clark struggles with the burden of keeping his powers a secret from those close to him. In particular, he is afraid to open up to Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) for fear that she would not accept him if she learned of his supernatural abilities.|$|E
5|$|This species {{lives in}} many habitats, {{including}} deserts, forests, woodland and urban areas. They nest underground below logs, stones, twigs, and shrubs, or in decayed wooden stumps, and are sometimes found living in termite mounds. They {{are among the}} first insects {{to be found in}} burnt-off areas after the embers have stopped smouldering. Rain presents no threat to colonies {{as long as it is}} a light <b>shower</b> <b>in</b> continuous sunshine. The green-head ant is diurnal, active throughout the day, preying on arthropods and small insects or collecting sweet substances such as honeydew from sap-sucking insects. They play an important role in seed dispersal, scattering and consuming seeds from a variety of species. Predators include the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and a number of bird species.|$|E

25|$|The {{patient is}} {{discharged}} from hospital either {{the same day}} or {{the day after the}} breast reduction operation. Because the liposuction-only procedure featured only a few, small, surgical incisions, the woman quickly recovers her health, usually resuming daily life activities at 14 to 28 days post-operative — when the breast-molding dressings are changed; she also resumes her personal hygiene regimen to include washing under a water <b>shower.</b> <b>In</b> the initial convalescence period, the surgical-incision wounds are inspected at 1-week post-operative, during which time the woman has continuously worn a strapless brassière to contain and immobilize her corrected breasts; afterwards, she continuously wears a strapped brassière for 30 days after the breast-reduction operation.|$|E

25|$|Morton Ann Gernsbacher, a {{professor}} of psychology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, compares the orientation of toilet paper to the orientation of cutlery in a dishwasher, the choice of which drawer in a chest of drawers to place one's socks, and the order of shampooing one's hair and lathering one's body in the <b>shower.</b> <b>In</b> each choice, there is a prototypical solution chosen by the majority, and it is tempting to offer simplistic explanations of how the minority must be different. She warns that neuroimaging experiments—which as of 2007 were beginning to probe behaviors from mental rotation and facial expressions to grocery shopping and tickling—must strive to avoid such cultural bias and stereotypes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} day that the police force found an {{apartment}} used as a base by the Red Brigades in Rome, on via Gradoli 96. The discovery was allegedly due to a water leak for which a neighbour had called the firemen. The leak was caused by a tap left open in the apartment's <b>shower</b> <b>in</b> an unusual fashion, i.e. with water directed against the wall. The base was normally used by Mario Moretti but the Italian media reported the discovery immediately and he avoided returning there. As previously mentioned, the palace had been inspected by Carabinieri under colonel Varisco, with the exclusion of Moretti's apartment: the official justification was that the Carabinieri were not authorized to enter the apartments if no one was inside. The owner of the apartment, Luciana Bozzi, was later discovered to be a friend of Giuliana Conforto, whose father was named in the Mitrokhin list of the KGB, and in whose apartments Morucci and Faranda were later arrested.|$|E
25|$|As Perth did {{not have}} a Test match, players from the eastern states were sent to {{strengthen}} Western Australia for a second game against the tourists. On this occasion only the veteran batsman Peter Burge of Queensland and the young Bob Cowper of Victoria were flown over. Barry Shepherd won the toss and put the MCC in to bat on a day interrupted by four showers. After an opening stand of 74 between Bob Barber (34) and John Edrich (92), Laurie Mayne (3/98) reduced them to 199/6. M.J.K. Smith (112 not out) and Fred Titmus (69) restored the situation with a seventh wicket stand of 139 before Smith declared at 379/7 during a <b>shower</b> <b>in</b> the second afternoon 'to get out of the wet'. Murray Vernon and Pat Kelly added 47 runs in ten overs before they were out in successive balls. Cowper (89) and Burge (52) top-scored in the Combined XI's slow 231/5, Shepherd again declaring after the follow on had been avoided. In reply Bob Barber (113) reached 100 in 89 minutes and helped by Peter Parfitt, Colin Cowdrey and Smith, who all made 24, the MCC made 205/4 to leave the hosts 354 runs to win in 273 minutes. Vernon (44) and Kelly (33) added 71 for the first wicket and Cowper made 122 not out, adding 87 with Burge (50) and 84 with Shepherd (39 not out), but they fell 32 runs short with 4 wickets in hand and the game was a draw.|$|E

500|$|The {{habitat of}} the green-head ant varies, ranging from desert, heath, open forests, urban areas and woodland. These ants mainly live in {{moderate}} wooded or open areas, {{but they are}} abundant in lawns and gardens in cities. Nests {{have been found in}} dry and wet sclerophyll woodland, mallee, savannah woodland, on roadsides, and in native vegetation. Green-head ants are mostly found at altitudes of between [...] above sea level. The workers construct small and loosely integrated nests underground or in decaying wooden stumps. They may also nest in the termite mounds of Amitermes laurensis. These nests are commonly found beneath grass roots or under logs, stones, twigs, or at the base of shrubs. Green-head ants can nest in disturbed areas, and, as a result, colonies of these ants are rather common in urban areas. They are among the first insects to be seen foraging for food in areas where bushfires have occurred, and in some cases they return right after the embers have stopped smouldering. Rain also presents no threat to green-head ants {{as long as it is}} a light <b>shower</b> <b>in</b> continuous sunshine.|$|E

40|$|Air-fluorescence {{detectors}} {{such as the}} High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) detector {{are very}} sensitive to upward-going, Earth-skimming ultrahigh energy electron-neutrino-induced showers. This is due to the relatively large interaction cross sections of these high-energy neutrinos and to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. The LPM effect causes a significant decrease in the cross sections for bremsstrahlung and pair production, allowing charged-current electron-neutrino-induced <b>showers</b> occurring deep <b>in</b> the Earth's crust to be detectable as they exit the Earth into the atmosphere. A search for upward-going neutrino-induced <b>showers</b> <b>in</b> the HiRes-II monocular dataset has yielded a null result. From an LPM calculation of the energy spectrum of charged particles as a function of primary energy and depth for electron-induced <b>showers</b> <b>in</b> rock, we calculate the shape of the resulting profile of these <b>showers</b> <b>in</b> air. We describe a full detector Monte Carlo simulation to determine the detector response to upward-going electron-neutrino-induced cascades and present an upper limit on the flux of electron-neutrinos.
