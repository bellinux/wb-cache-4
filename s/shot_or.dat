5|$|If a ball travels {{outside of}} the playing area, play is {{restarted}} by possession being awarded to the opponents of the team which last touched the ball, unless the ball goes out of bounds due to a <b>shot</b> <b>or</b> a deflected shot. In that case, possession is awarded to the player that is closest to the ball when it leaves the playing area.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Sikorski was exhumed and his {{remains were}} {{examined}} by Polish scientists, who in 2009 concluded that he died due to injuries consistent with an air crash, {{and that there was}} no evidence that Sikorski was murdered, ruling out theories that he was <b>shot</b> <b>or</b> strangled before the incident; however they did not rule out the possibility of sabotage, which is still being investigated by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance. , the investigation continues.|$|E
50|$|A {{workprint}} is a rough {{version of}} a motion picture, used by the film editor(s) during the editing process. Such copies generally contain original recorded sound that will later be re-dubbed, stock footage as placeholders for missing <b>shots</b> <b>or</b> special effects, and animation tests for in-production animated <b>shots</b> <b>or</b> sequences.|$|R

5|$|The D'Angelo-indebted grind session 'Rocket' and frisky 'Drunk In Love' are {{similarly}} sexy, but they're not sexy like a glamour <b>shot</b> <b>or</b> a steamy video. They're sexy like an overeager, pre-shower quickie, or a hushed morning make-out session before the baby wakes up. These {{are the most}} unapologetically raunchy songs she's ever sung, {{and in many ways}} also the most romantic.|$|E
5|$|Further {{measures}} included pouring {{boiling water}} over the grave or complete incineration of the body. In the Balkans, a vampire could also be killed by being <b>shot</b> <b>or</b> drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling holy water on the body, or by exorcism. In Romania, garlic could {{be placed in the}} mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, a lemon was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.|$|E
5|$|Giordano {{was named}} the 19th captain in Flames history on September 20, 2013, as he succeeded Jarome Iginla, who was traded late in the 2012–13 season. Giordano was praised by his {{teammates}} and coaches staff for both his long tenure with the franchise and for his playing style: Giordano played in all situations for the Flames, {{was one of the}} hardest workers on the team and was willing to sacrifice himself to block a <b>shot</b> <b>or</b> defend his teammates. Head coach Bob Hartley praised Giordano's influence on his teammates as the rebuilding Flames team established an identity as a squad which was noted across the league for its work ethic.|$|E
60|$|His {{commands}} were staccato, like revolver <b>shots</b> <b>or</b> {{the cracks}} of whips, and Michael obeyed them in his same slow, reluctant way.|$|R

5|$|Henry became King of England {{following}} the death of William Rufus, who had been shot while hunting. On the afternoon of 2 August 1100, the King had gone hunting in the New Forest, accompanied by a team of huntsmen and a number of the Norman nobility, including Henry. An arrow was fired, possibly by the baron Walter Tirel, which hit and killed William Rufus. Numerous conspiracy theories have been put forward suggesting that the King was killed deliberately; most modern historians reject these, as hunting was a risky activity, and such accidents were common. Chaos broke out, and Tirel fled the scene for France, either because he had fired the fatal <b>shot,</b> <b>or</b> because he had been incorrectly accused and feared that he would be made a scapegoat for the King's death.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{all work}} units were {{continuously}} beaten by {{the guards and}} often <b>shot</b> <b>or</b> hanged at the gallows. Only the strongest men were selected from new arrivals daily to obtain the necessary replacements. There were other work details which had no contact with the transports: the Holzfällerkommando ("woodcutter unit") cut and chopped firewood, and the Tarnungskommando ("disguise unit") camouflaged the structures of the camp. Another work detail was responsible for cleaning the common areas. The Camp 1 Wohnlager residential compound contained barracks for about 700 Sonderkommandos which, when combined with the 300 Totenjuden living across from the gas chambers, brought their grand total to roughly one thousand at a time.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, {{a report}} {{on the quality of the}} walls around 1460 noted that on the north and east sides of Southampton, the walls were still too thin to block a cannon <b>shot</b> <b>or</b> for a man to stand on them; a wood and earth wall-walk had been built behind the walls, but this was proving very {{expensive}} to maintain. This contemporary assessment of the weakness of the eastern walls has been confirmed by modern archaeological excavation – in places it was only 0.76 m (2.49 feet) thick, compared to a typical thickness in other English town walls of around 1 m (3.28 feet).|$|E

5|$|Open country species, which {{comprise}} {{the majority of}} bee-eaters, have mostly expanded in range as more land is converted to agriculture, but some tropical forest species have suffered declines through loss of habitat, although no species or subspecies gives serious cause for concern. There is some human persecution of bee-eaters, with nest holes being blocked, adults <b>shot</b> <b>or</b> limed, or young taken for food. More generally problematic is the unintended destruction of nests. This can occur through cattle trampling, as with the blue-headed bee-eater in Kenya, or loss of forests, with massive conversion of native forest to oil palm plantations in Malaysia being particularly concerning.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the Duke of Braganza mounted cannons, dug trenches, tended the wounded, ate {{among the}} rank and file and fought under heavy fire as men next to him were <b>shot</b> <b>or</b> blown to pieces. His cause was nearly lost until he took the risky step of {{dividing}} his forces and sending a portion to launch an amphibious attack on southern Portugal. The Algarve region fell to the expedition, which then marched north straight for Lisbon, which capitulated on 24 July. Pedro proceeded to subdue the remainder of the country, but just when the conflict looked to be winding down to a conclusion, his Spanish uncle Don Carlos, who was attempting to seize the crown of his niece Doña IsabelII, intervened. In this wider conflict that engulfed the entire Iberian Peninsula, the First Carlist War, the Duke of Braganza allied with liberal Spanish armies loyal to IsabelII and defeated both MiguelI and Carlos. A peace accord was reached on 26 May 1834.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the army}} into the Soviet Union, the Einsatzgruppen rounded up and killed Jews and others deemed {{undesirable}} by the Nazi state. Hitler was sent frequent reports. In addition, 2.8 million Soviet {{prisoners of war}} died of starvation, mistreatment or executions in just eight months of 1941–42. As many as 500,000 Soviet prisoners of war died or were executed in Nazi concentration camps {{over the course of}} the war; most of them were <b>shot</b> <b>or</b> gassed. By early 1941, following Himmler's orders, ten concentration camps had been constructed in which inmates were subjected to forced labour. Jews from all over Germany and the occupied territories were deported to the camps or confined to ghettos. As the Germans were pushed back from Moscow in December 1941, signalling that the expected quick defeat of the Soviet Union had failed to materialize, Hitler and other Nazi officials realised that mass deportations to the east would no longer be possible. As a result, instead of deportation, many Jews in Europe were destined for death.|$|E

5|$|Gunfights {{are a major}} {{gameplay}} mechanic in Red Dead Redemption. The {{player can}} take cover, target a specific person or animal, blindfire, and free aim. Individual body parts can also be targeted, {{in order to take}} targets down non-lethally. When the player shoots an enemy, the game engine uniquely creates the AI reactions and movements depending on where they were hit. The player character can choose from period-accurate weapons including revolvers, pistols, lever or bolt-action rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, knives, explosives, lassos, mounted Gatling guns, and cannons. Duels utilize a gunslinger gameplay mechanic known as Dead Eye. Dead Eye is a targeting system that is used in a bullet time-like manner, allowing the player to slow down time to place a precise <b>shot</b> <b>or</b> paint in multiple shots. When the targeting sequence ends, Marston automatically fires to all marked locations in extremely quick succession.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, common {{starlings}} {{are exempt}} from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which prohibits the taking or killing of migratory birds. No permit is required to remove nests and eggs or kill juveniles or adults. Research was undertaken in 1966 to identify a suitable avicide that would both kill common starlings and would readily be eaten by them. It also needed to be of low toxicity to mammals and not likely to cause the death of pets that ate dead birds. The chemical that best fitted these criteria was DRC-1339, now marketed as Starlicide. In 2008, the United States government poisoned, <b>shot</b> <b>or</b> trapped 1.7million birds, {{the largest number of}} any nuisance species to be destroyed. In 2005, the population in the United States was estimated at 140million birds, around 45% of the global total of 310million.|$|E
5|$|Radu is {{interviewed in}} {{this portion of}} the film, as is Tournecuillert, who speaks about his {{experiences}} in Albania, where he heard about the sex trafficking of girls and how some of the girls would be <b>shot</b> <b>or</b> burned to death as a warning to the other girls. He describes how Albanian girls are often rounded up to be sexually trafficked in Italy. He further explains that, normally, before they leave Albania, the traffickers kill one of the girls in front of the others—usually by burning or shooting—to demonstrate what will happen to others who try to escape. Matei adds that, for the sake of amusement, some of the girls would be buried alive with only their heads remaining above ground. Eugenia Bonetti, a nun, speaks about her work helping girls escape from slavery in Italy.|$|E

50|$|As {{part of the}} way {{she uses}} the camera the film has few {{establishing}} <b>shots</b> <b>or</b> transition <b>shots</b> because she makes the case it physically separates a space from its moment in the film.|$|R
5|$|The player's {{health is}} {{represented}} by a percentage starting at 100, which is diminished when they are <b>shot</b> <b>or</b> attacked by enemies. If the player's health falls to zero, they lose one life and start the level over with a knife, a pistol, and eight bullets. The player begins each episode with three lives and can gain more by finding extra-life tokens or by earning enough points. Points are scored by killing enemies or collecting treasures scattered throughout the levels. Points can also be scored by killing all enemies in a level, collecting all treasure, finding all secret areas, or completing a level under a par time; the player's completion ratio and speed is displayed when a level is completed. Secret areas containing treasure, health refills, or ammunition {{can be found in}} hidden rooms revealed by activating certain wall tiles that slide back when triggered. The original version of the game allows the player to save their progress at any point, though in many of its ports the player can only save between levels.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{elephants}} in circuses {{has also been}} controversial; the Humane Society of the United States has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals. In testimony to a US federal court in 2009, Barnum & Bailey Circus CEO Kenneth Feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears, under their chins and on their legs with metal-tipped prods, called bull hooks or ankus. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device, known as a hot <b>shot</b> <b>or</b> electric prod, on an elephant. Despite this, he denied {{that any of these}} practices harm elephants. Some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of physical punishment. Ralph Helfer is known to have relied on gentleness and reward when training his animals, including elephants and lions. Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey circus retired its touring elephants in May 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} of the breech-loader was the obvious problem of sealing the breech. All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of a solid propellant into gas. This explosion propels the <b>shot</b> <b>or</b> shell {{out of the front}} of the gun, but also imposes great stresses on the gun-barrel. If the breech—which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun—is not entirely secure, then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break. This in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew. Warriors Armstrong guns suffered from both problems; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4.5in (118mm) armor of Gloire, while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing. Similar problems were experienced with the breech-loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies.|$|E
