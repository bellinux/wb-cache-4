5|$|Already in 1951, {{relationships}} {{had deteriorated}} enough for Pollock, Newman, <b>Still</b> <b>and</b> Rothko to approach Betty Parsons {{with the idea}} of showing them exclusively, effectively leaving their erstwhile colleagues to fend for themselves. She declined the offer. Over the following three years Pollock, <b>Still</b> <b>and</b> Rothko moved to the Sidney Janis Gallery. After the failure of fellow artists to defend his show at Betty Parsons in 1951 and not been included in the 1952 Fifteen Americans show at the Museum of Modern Art, Newman did not show in New York again until 1959.|$|E
5|$|Animaniacs {{was made}} with a higher {{production}} value than standard television animation; the show had a higher cel count than most TV cartoons. The Animaniacs characters often move fluidly, and do not regularly stand <b>still</b> <b>and</b> speak, as in other television cartoons.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the House Select Committee on Assassinations studied several <b>still</b> <b>and</b> motion images, {{including}} an enhanced {{version of the}} Altgens photograph, in the scope of its investigation.

Using phosphonates with electron-withdrawing groups (trifluoroethyl) together with strongly dissociating conditions (KHMDS and 18-crown-6 in THF) nearly exclusive Z-alkene production can be achieved.|$|E
5|$|Banksia cuneata is {{most easily}} {{distinguished}} from the other two species in B.subg. Isostylis by its brighter flowers and duller leaves. It further differs from B.ilicifolia in its smaller habit; its smooth bark; its smaller leaves, flowers and fruit; and in its sequence of flower colour changes. The leaves, flowers and fruit of B.oligantha are smaller <b>still,</b> <b>and</b> its foliage is not as prickly as that of B.cuneata.|$|E

5|$|Elephant ears have thick bases {{with thin}} tips. The ear flaps, or pinnae, contain {{numerous}} blood vessels called capillaries. Warm blood {{flows into the}} capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This occurs when the pinnae are <b>still,</b> <b>and</b> the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have the largest ear flaps. Elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 kHz.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} the signal {{receiver}} is lured toward the mimic. This involves mimicry of a resource that is often vital to the prey's survival (or more precisely, the survival of its genes) such as nutrition or a mate. If the bait offered is of little value to prey {{they would not be}} expected to take such a risk. For example, in all known cases of sexual signal mimicry it is always the male sex that is deceived (in fact, {{it has been suggested that}} females of some species have evolved mimicry as a strategy to avoid unwanted matings). In these cases the predator need not move about foraging for prey, but may simply stay <b>still</b> <b>and</b> allow prey to come to it.|$|E
5|$|Members {{who would}} become famous {{included}} George Burns and Bucharest-born Edward G. Robinson, who had his Bar Mitzvah there in 1906.

5|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} lifting off at sunrise in Japan, the men {{began to see}} the sun rise again over the Yukon—it was a very short day for them, and none had been able to sleep for the {{excitement}} of the trip, the stimulant benzedrine, and the penetrating cold. Crossing into Canada, the headwinds grew stronger <b>still,</b> <b>and</b> a load of hard rime ice and clear ice was visible on the wings. Though the B-29s had been delivered to the war front complete with deicing equipment, such gear had been removed months before to reduce weight and therefore increase combat range and speed. The ice load picked up in the night would have to be endured until it melted off at lower altitudes.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of southeastern trade winds and northwestern monsoons produces a hot rainy season (November–April) with frequently destructive cyclones, and a relatively cooler dry season (May–October). Rain clouds originating over the Indian Ocean discharge {{much of their}} moisture over the island's eastern coast; the heavy precipitation supports the area's rain forest ecosystem. The central highlands are both drier and cooler while the west is drier <b>still,</b> <b>and</b> a semi-arid climate prevails in the southwest and southern interior of the island.|$|E
5|$|The film {{director}} is unknown, {{but it may}} have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a <b>still</b> <b>and</b> motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. A surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying the three leading actors.|$|E

5|$|These ground rollers feed {{primarily}} on invertebrates, including ants, beetles, butterflies, and worms, which they find by searching through deep leaf litter or by remaining <b>still</b> <b>and</b> watching attentively. The ground roller primarily runs through its habitat on its strong legs, as its wings are relatively weak. It is a monogamous species, and it defends a territory during the breeding season of October to February. It digs a tunnel in the sand, {{at the end}} of which is a wider chamber where it makes its nest out of leaves and earthy pellets. Two to four eggs are laid. After the chicks fledge, the birds continue living in family groups until at least February before dispersing more widely across the scrubland.|$|E
5|$|This species forages almost {{exclusively}} from the ground, where it alternates between remaining <b>still</b> <b>and</b> watching attentively and actively searching {{for it by}} rummaging through deep leaf litter. It eats {{a wide range of}} invertebrates, including ants, beetles, butterflies, caterpillars, cockroaches, grasshoppers, woodlice, and worms, and occasionally small vertebrates. Despite the long-tailed ground roller's poor flying abilities, it has been seen catching butterflies in midair.|$|E

5|$|This species forages in {{the early}} morning or late {{afternoon}} either alone or in small groups in leaf litter and on dead tree trunks. It is also known to leap upwards to grab prey on overhanging foliage. It looks for its prey either by standing <b>still</b> <b>and</b> scanning the surrounding area or by tossing the leaf litter away with its beak. It also frequently follows columns of Dorylus ants, feeding on the insects flushed by the ants. It also is known to hunt in streams for crabs and fish. It crushes snails with its beak and, if its prey struggles, smashes it against the ground. While an uncommon occurrence, male rockfowl have been observed giving food to a female.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of poisoning from the bite; the majority of cases do not require medical care, and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice and simple oral analgesia such as paracetamol. Pressure immobilisation of the wound site is not recommended. Keeping the victim <b>still</b> <b>and</b> calm is beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Few {{inorganic}} lead(IV) compounds are known, {{and these}} exist only in highly acidic solutions. Lead(II) oxide gives a mixed oxide on further oxidation, Pb3O4. It {{is described as}} lead(II,IV) oxide, or structurally 2PbO·PbO2, and is the best-known mixed valence lead compound. Lead dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas. This is because the expected PbCl4 that would be produced is unstable and spontaneously decomposes to PbCl2 and Cl2. Analogously to lead monoxide, lead dioxide is capable of forming plumbate anions. Lead disulfide and lead diselenide are only stable at high pressures. Lead tetrafluoride, a yellow crystalline powder, is stable, but less so than the difluoride. Lead tetrachloride (a yellow oil) decomposes at room temperature, lead tetrabromide is less stable <b>still,</b> <b>and</b> the existence of lead tetraiodide is questionable.|$|E
