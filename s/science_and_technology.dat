5|$|Malawi’s first <b>science</b> <b>and</b> <b>technology</b> policy {{dates from}} 1991 and was revised in 2002. The National <b>Science</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> Policy of 2002 envisaged the {{establishment}} of a National Commission for <b>Science</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> to advise the government and other stakeholders on science and technology-led development. Although the <b>Science</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> Act of 2003 made provision for the creation of this commission, it only became operational in 2011, with a secretariat resulting from the merger of the Department of <b>Science</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> and the National Research Council. The <b>Science</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> Act of 2003 also established a <b>Science</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> Fund to finance research and studies through government grants and loans but, as of 2014, this was not yet operational. The Secretariat of the National Commission for <b>Science</b> <b>and</b> <b>Technology</b> has reviewed the Strategic Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation (2011–2015) but, as of early 2015, the revised policy had not yet met with Cabinet approval.|$|E
