40|$|Seed bank studies {{focused on}} <b>submerged</b> aquatic plants are {{generally}} performed under <b>submerged</b> conditions, using the seedling-emergence method. However, if a study targets at both <b>submerged</b> species and helophytes, <b>submerged</b> conditions {{are generally not}} suitable. We tested the emergence of seedlings from sediment samples from a freshwater canal, comparing a waterlogged treatment with a <b>submerged</b> treatment. From the sediment samples 31 species emerged. Eight species germinated in significantly larger numbers from the waterlogged treatment, one being a <b>submerged</b> species and four helophytes. No species germinated better under <b>submerged</b> conditions. The total number of species germinating under waterlogged conditions {{was significantly higher than}} under <b>submerged</b> conditions. Germination experiments with Potamogeton species showed no significant differences in germination percentage between a waterlogged and <b>submerged</b> treatment for at least two species. In the study of seed banks of <b>submerged</b> sediments, aimed at both <b>submerged</b> aquatic plants and helophytes, a waterlogged treatment is therefore suitable to detect both groups of plants.

50|$|<b>Submerged</b> {{specific}} gravity {{is equal to}} the {{specific gravity}} given by the ratio of the weight of the object to the weight of the fluid) minus one. That is, the object and fluid have the same density when the specific gravity equals one and the <b>submerged</b> specific gravity equals zero. This fact highlights the utility of the usage of <b>submerged</b> specific gravity in problems involving buoyancy and force balances on <b>submerged</b> objects: the object will naturally rise when its <b>submerged</b> specific gravity is negative, and sink when its <b>submerged</b> specific gravity is positive. Because of this characteristic and its dimensionless nature, <b>submerged</b> specific gravity is ubiquitous in equations of sediment transport.|$|R
5|$|In 2017, David E. Hone and Thomas R. Holtz {{pointed out}} that (like other theropods) {{there was no reason}} to believe that the forelimbs of Baryonyx were able to pronate, and thereby make it able to rest or walk on its palms. Resting on or using the forelimbs for {{locomotion}} may have been possible (as indicated by tracks of a resting theropod), but if this was the norm, the forelimbs would probably have showed adaptations for this. Hone and Holtz furthermore suggested that the forelimbs of spinosaurids do not seem optimal for trapping prey, but instead appear similar to the forelimbs of digging animals. They suggested that the ability to dig would have been useful when excavating nests, digging for water, or to reach some kinds of prey. Hone and Holtz also believed that spinosaurids would have waded and dipped in water rather than <b>submerging</b> themselves, due to their sparsity of aquatic adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have {{estimated}} {{that there have been}} at least 13significant earthquakes along the Cascadia subduction zone in the last 6,000years. The most recent, the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, was recorded in the oral traditions of the First Nations people on Vancouver Island. It caused considerable tremors and a massive tsunami that traveled across the Pacific Ocean. The significant shaking associated with this earthquake demolished houses of the Cowichan Tribes on Vancouver Island and caused several landslides. Shaking due to this earthquake made it too difficult for the Cowichan people to stand, and the tremors were so lengthy that they were sickened. The tsunami created by the earthquake ultimately devastated a winter village at Pachena Bay, killing all the people that lived there. The 1700 Cascadia earthquake caused near-shore subsidence, <b>submerging</b> marshes and forests on the coast that were later buried under more recent debris.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} in Days of Ruin {{is for the}} player to use their military force to defeat the enemy's force. Except for certain single player missions with special objectives, {{there are two ways}} to defeat an opponent: destroy all of the enemy's units or capture their headquarters. The battle system is turn-based. Two to four forces, each headed by a commanding officer (CO), take turns building and commanding units on grid-based maps. Every turn, units, which consist of ground, sea and air units, can move across the different types of terrain and attack enemy units or perform other actions, such as <b>submerging</b> a submarine or resupplying friendly units. Many factors can affect the battle, such as Fog of War, a phenomenon that prevents players from seeing enemy units other than those in the visual range of their units; various weather conditions; and CO powers.|$|E

5|$|Under {{threat from}} the {{hurricane}}, all of Cape Verde was placed under a hurricane warning {{for the first time}} in the nation's history. Gale-force winds battered much of the Barlavento region throughout August31, downing trees and utility poles. On the easternmost islands of Boa Vista and Sal, Fred leveled roofs and left several villages without power or phone services for a few days. About 70percent of the houses in Povoação Velha suffered light to moderate damage. Across the northernmost islands, rainstorms flooded homes, washed out roads, and ruined farmland; São Nicolau endured great losses of crops and livestock. Material damage across Cape Verde totaled US$2.5million, though the rain's overall impact on agriculture was positive and replenishing. Swells from the hurricane produced violent seas along the West African shoreline, destroying fishing villages and <b>submerging</b> swaths of residential areas in Senegal. Between the coasts of West Africa and Cape Verde, maritime incidents related to Fred resulted in nine deaths.|$|E
5|$|Water is the {{dominant}} element in the Everglades, and it shapes the land, vegetation, and animal life of South Florida. The South Florida climate was once arid and semi-arid, interspersed with wet periods. Between 10,000 and 20,000years ago, sea levels rose, <b>submerging</b> portions of the Florida peninsula and causing the water table to rise. Fresh water saturated the limestone, eroding some of it and creating springs and sinkholes. The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation to take root, and through evaporation formed thunderstorms. Limestone was dissolved by the slightly acidic rainwater. The limestone wore away, and groundwater {{came into contact with}} the surface, creating a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, the wearing away of the limestone in some areas created slight valleys and plateaus—a difference of inches in elevation—that affected not only the flow of water, but also types of vegetation present.|$|E
5|$|When a {{hurricane}} arrives at Langley Falls, the Smiths prepare to evacuate their {{home with their}} neighbor Buckle in his amphibious raft. Stan, however, recommends that the family stay home during the storm, believing {{it is the best}} way for everyone to be safe. Hayley and Jeff also wish to stay to help the animals that have been left behind in the zoo. Francine disagrees with Stan's notion, Steve and Roger supporting her, as she points out Stan's history with making terrible decisions during crisis situations. But before the debate can be resolved, the seawall breaks and the ocean floods down the street, removing Buckle and his raft out of its path and trapping the Smiths in their home nevertheless. The neighborhood is now flooded, and while the smiths thinks it's too late to escape, the house is drifting along the floodwater's current. In an attempt to save the family from floating into any potential dangerous areas, Stan anchors the home; however the anchoring system also acts as a hinge and rotates the house upside-down, partially <b>submerging</b> it underwater.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} seismic {{response}} of <b>submerged</b> floating tunnel, a numerical model of <b>submerged</b> floating tunnel {{is set up}} based on the potential fluid theory. According to the parameters of designed <b>submerged</b> floating tunnels at home and abroad, main factors that affect the dynamic response of <b>submerged</b> floating tunnel were analyzed by numerical method. The results show that, the investigated parameters, such as tether spacing, external diameter of tube, immersion depth of tube, water depth and tube concrete thickness, have strong influence on the global behavior of the <b>submerged</b> floating tunnel.

40|$|Respiratory {{activities}} were compared among rice seedlings germinated in air for 6 days (aerobic seedlings), those germinated under water for 5 days (<b>submerged</b> seedlings), and those grown in air for 1 day after 5 days' <b>submerged</b> germination (air-adapted seedlings). The respiratory {{activity of the}} <b>submerged</b> seedlings increased rapidly on transfer to air and reached a plateau at 16 hours in air. Respiration of the <b>submerged</b> seedlings was as sensitive to cyanide as those of aerobic and air-adapted seedlings. 2, 4 -Dinitrophenol {{had no effect on}} the respiration of the <b>submerged</b> seedlings, but stimulated those of the other two types of seedlings. Mitochondria from three types of seedlings did not differ in the ADP/O ratio and the respiratory control ratio (RCR) when succinate was oxidized. However, mitochondria from <b>submerged</b> seedlings (<b>submerged</b> mitochondria) showed poor RCR of about unity when malate was oxidized. Both the rate of succinate oxidation and succinate dehydrogenase activity were low in <b>submerged</b> mitochondria, but increased during air adaptation. Although <b>submerged</b> mitochondria oxidized malate very slowly, this activity increased after exposure to air without any increase in malate dehydrogenase activity. When NAD+ was added to <b>submerged</b> mitochondria, oxidation of malate was restored {{to the level of the}} aerobic controls. Addition of NAD+ enhanced the state 3 rate in <b>submerged</b> mitochondria, and RCR recovered to nearly the same value as that of the aerobic controls. Similar effects of NAD+ on 2 -oxoglutarate oxidation were observed. All these defects in <b>submerged</b> mitochondria were repaired during air adaptation. These results suggest that NAD+-linked substrate oxidation was low in <b>submerged</b> mitochondria because of NAD+ deficiency, and that the oxidation increased with an increasing level of NAD+ during air adaptation...|$|R
5|$|Around 9,000 years ago, {{the climate}} warmed, melting {{much of the}} polar ice caps and many glaciers, {{creating}} a wetter environment and <b>submerging</b> half the peninsular shelf. As Paleo-Indians now {{did not have to}} travel as far to find water, their camps became more permanent, turning into villages. With evidence {{of a wide variety of}} tools constructed around this time, archeologists note the transition into Archaic people. The Archaic people made tools from bone, animal teeth, and antlers. They wove fibers from plants such as cabbage palms and saw palmettos. A few burial sites have been excavated—including the Windover Archaeological Site in Brevard County near Titusville—that provide evidence of burial rituals. Archaic peoples interred their dead in shallow peat marshes, which preserved much of the human tissue. Further climate change between 5,000 and 3,000 years ago led to the Middle Archaic period; evidence suggests that human habitation near the St. Johns River first occurred during this era. Populations of indigenous people increased significantly at this time, and numerous settlements near the St. Johns have been recorded from this era; the banks of the St. Johns and its arteries are dotted with middens filled with thousands of shells, primarily those of Viviparus georgianus—a freshwater snail—and oysters.|$|E
5|$|Sharon renewed his division's {{attack that}} day, moving north from Serabaeum on a three brigade front, with Matt on the right, Erez in the center, and Reshef on the left. The advance spanned {{the entire area}} between the Suez Canal on {{the east and the}} Sweetwater Canal on the west. By dawn, both Touscan and Ain Ghasin were under attack. The 89th Battalion had {{concentrated}} all its forces at the Touscan strong point, where it was hard-pressed by superior Israeli armored and mechanized forces. Azmy reported the situation to Second Army headquarters, and requested permission to detonate a nearby bridge on the Sweetwater Canal and flood the area before the advancing Israelis. Khalil however issued strict orders not to do so, since the canal was a crucial source of drinking water to civilians {{all the way up to}} Suez city. The situation was deteriorating for the paratroopers however, and Azmy soon had the bridge destroyed and broke down sections of nearby irrigation canals, flooding the entire area and <b>submerging</b> Israeli tanks up to their hulls in muddy water. This led to the paratroopers of Matt's brigade spearheading the advance in the center instead, while the armored brigades were forced to have their mechanized infantry push ahead on foot. The Touscan position remained under heavy air and artillery attack, and by midday it was surrounded. Losses due to death and injury left the battalion with some 120 paratroopers still able to fight.|$|E
