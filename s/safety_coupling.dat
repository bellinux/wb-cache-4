40|$|In Mexico, {{increasing}} {{demands for}} public <b>safety</b> <b>coupled</b> {{with the need}} for a more effective criminal justice system resulted in the security and justice constitutional reform of 2008. The outcome was a constitutional framework with provisions based on the highest standards of human rights on the one hand, and on the other, exceptional measures that restrict rights in an attempt to improve public safety. Unfortunately, the crime rate and incidence of unreported crime have changed little. When public safety is demanded, a clear, rational and concrete response is required. Limiting the alternatives to pre-trial detention or increasing penalties is rarely the appropriate response. This paper focuses on pre-trial detention and non-custodial measures supported by the new criminal justice system, how they relate to the principle of the presumption of innocence and the tension between this and the punitive demands for increased imprisonment. In addition, this study discusses a technical solution, found in pre-trial services, which seeks to balance the presumption of innocence and the right to personal liberty with public safety...|$|R

40|$|Petri nets are {{graphical}} {{and mathematical}} tools that are applicable to many systems for modeling, simulation, and analysis. With {{the emergence of}} the concept of partitioning in time and space domains proposed in avionics application standard software interface (ARINC 653), it has become difficult to analyze time–space coupling hazards resulting from resource partitioning using classical or advanced Petri nets. In this paper, we propose a time–space <b>coupling</b> <b>safety</b> constraint and an improved timed colored Petri net with imposed time–space <b>coupling</b> <b>safety</b> constraints (TCCP-NET) to fill this requirement gap. Time–space coupling hazard analysis is conducted in three steps: specification modeling, simulation execution, and results analysis. A TCCP-NET is employed to model and analyze integrated modular avionics (IMA), a real-time, safety-critical system. The analysis results are used to verify whether there exist time–space coupling hazards at runtime. The method we propose demonstrates superior modeling of safety-critical real-time systems as it can specify resource allocations in both time and space domains. TCCP-NETs can effectively detect underlying time–space coupling hazards...|$|R

40|$|Context. Although spiritual care (SC) is {{recognized}} as important in whole-person medicine, physicians infrequently address patients’ spiritual needs, citing lack of training. Although many SC curricula descriptions exist, few studies report effects on physicians. Objectives. To broadly examine immediate and long-term effects of a required, longitudinal, residency SC curriculum, which emphasized inclusive patient-centered SC, compassion, and spiritual self-care. Methods. We conducted in-depth individual interviews with 26 physicians (13 intervention; 13 comparison) trained at a 13 - 13 - 13 residency. We interviewed intervention physicians three times over 10 yearsd 1) preintervention, as PGY 1 s, 2) postintervention, as PGY 3 s, 3) eight-year postintervention, as practicing physicians. We interviewed comparison physicians as PGY 3 s. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by four researchers. Results. Forty-nine interviews were analyzed. General: Both groups were diverse regarding personal importance of spirituality/religion. All physicians endorsed the value of SC, sharing rich patient stories particularly related to end of life and cultural diversity. Curricular effects: 1) skills/barriersdintervention physicians demonstrated progressive improvements in clinical approach, accompanied by diminishing worries related to SC. PGY 3 comparison physicians struggled with SC skills and worries more than PGY 3 intervention physicians, 2) physician formationdmost physicians described residency as profoundly challenging and transformative. Even after eight years, many intervention physicians noted that reflection on their diverse beliefs and values in <b>safety,</b> <b>coupled</b> with compassion shown to them through this curriculum, had deeply positive effects.

40|$|Demonstrating {{compliance}} with food safety {{requirements of the}} global economy is a prerequisite for access. As tariff barriers diminish, developing countries are exposed to greater opportunities for repositioning their food manufacturing sectors in global value chains (GVCs). At the same time, the measures for the protection of public health and safety are becoming more stringent because of the series of food safety crises that characterised the global food value chain in the 1980 s and 1990 s, and that still linger on. The new demands arising from the need to protect consumer <b>safety,</b> <b>coupled</b> with the structure {{of the global economy}} have introduced new challenges for developing countries in terms of accessing the global food manufacturing value chain(GFMVC) with manufactured products. This is the case for the Ghanaian food manufacturing sector. Therefore, this study aims to understand the practice of developing food safety capability to enhance access to the GFMVC using high value added products, to identify performance gaps in the Ghanaian context and propose an appropriate framework (legal, institutional and policy) to address the major gaps, while meeting the basic requirements of food safety. A multiple case study methodology was adopted, using the UK food and drinks sector as a benchmark for the Ghanaian food manufacturing sector. The main techniques employed for data collection were surveys, interviews and content analysis. Based on the findings and insights gathered from the investigation, a technical regulation based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) is proposed as a means to enhance the compliance of enterprises in Ghana with the basic requirements of food safety. Because of the current lack of capability at the national and enterprise level, a four-phase implementation plan is recommended to progressively ease enterprises into mandatory {{compliance with}} integrated food safety management systems. The study also recommends that the current multiple agency structure is maintained, however, mandates, roles and responsibilities, and jurisdictions need to be clarified, and values reformed. Various kinds of support (e. g. funds, training) also have to be provided to enterprises to facilitate their compliance and enhance their access to the GFMVC.

The NGNP is a very high-temperature reactor (VHTR) with the design goal to produce high-temperature heat and electricity for nearby chemical plants. Because high-temperature heat can only be transported limited distances, the two plants will be close to each other. One of the primary applications for the VHTR would be to supply heat and electricity {{for the production of}} hydrogen. There was no assessment of chemical plant safety challenges. The primary application of this PIRT is to support the safety analysis of the NGNP coupled one or more small hydrogen production pilot plants. However, the chemical plant processes to be coupled to the NGNP have not yet been chosen; thus, a broad PIRT assessment was conducted to scope alternative potential applications and test facilities associated with the NGNP. The hazards associated with various chemicals and methods to minimize risks from those hazards are well understood within the chemical industry. Much but not all of the information required to assure safe conditions (separation distance, relative elevation, berms) is known for a reactor coupled to a chemical plant. There is also some experience with nuclear plants in several countries that have produced steam for industrial applications. The specific characteristics of the chemical plant, site layout, and the maximum stored inventories of chemicals can provide the starting point for the safety assessments.

40|$|A unified control {{framework}} is {{proposed for the}} control of fluid powered human power amplifiers. Human power amplifiers are mechanical tools that humans operate directly and the human force is amplified hydraulically or pneumatically. The tool and the environment forces would therefore appear to the human as having been scaled down. Ideally, the assistive force is transparent to the human such that the tool should feel haptically like any other passive mechanical tool to the human. To ensure <b>safety</b> and <b>coupling</b> stability, it is helpful that the controlled human power amplifier interacts with the human opeartor and other environments passively. In the proposed unified {{control framework}}, the hydraulic or pneumatic actuator is controlled to interact virtually with a fictitious inertia. The control problem then becomes one of coordinating the velocities between virtual inertia and the actuator. Both processes of augmentation with virtual inertia, and coordination can be done passively; the latter via the energy preserving passive decomposition approach into locked and shaped systems.
