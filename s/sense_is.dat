The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind.

5|$|Astrology, in its {{broadest}} <b>sense,</b> <b>is</b> {{the search}} for meaning in the sky. Early evidence for humans making conscious attempts to measure, record, and predict seasonal changes by reference to astronomical cycles, appears as markings on bones and cave walls, which show that lunar cycles were being noted as early as 25,000 years ago. This was a first step towards recording the Moon's influence upon tides and rivers, and towards organising a communal calendar. Farmers addressed agricultural needs with increasing knowledge of the constellations that appear in the different seasons—and used the rising of particular star-groups to herald annual floods or seasonal activities. By the 3rd millennium BCE, civilisations had sophisticated awareness of celestial cycles, and may have oriented temples in alignment with heliacal risings of the stars.|$|E

The spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the main}} challenges encountered by cognitive radio. This paper presents a survey of spectrum sensing techniques and they are studied from a cognitive radio perspective. The challenges that go with spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>are</b> reviewed. Two <b>sensing</b> schemes, namely; cooperative sensing and eigenvalue-based <b>sensing</b> <b>are</b> studied. The various advantages and disadvantages are highlighted.

5|$|The rostral migratory stream (RMS) is a {{specialized}} migratory route {{found in the}} brain of some animals along which neuronal precursors that originated in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the brain migrate to reach the main olfactory bulb (OB). The importance of the RMS lies {{in its ability to}} refine and even change an animal's sensitivity to smells, which explains its importance and larger size in the rodent brain as compared to the human brain, as our olfactory <b>sense</b> <b>is</b> not as developed. This pathway has been studied in the rodent, rabbit, and both the squirrel monkey and rhesus monkey. When the neurons reach the OB they differentiate into GABAergic interneurons as they are integrated into either the granule cell layer or periglomerular layer.|$|E

30|$|As {{discussed}} before, spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the most}} important functions for the CWNs to obtain the available opportunistic spectrum bands. From the Table 1, we can observe that most of the existing protocols only allow each SU to use its local spectrum sensing to derive spectrum opportunities. Although only utilizing local sensing can simplify the protocol architecture, it can also lead to some problems, such as sensing errors and hidden PU problem. Cooperative <b>sensing</b> <b>is</b> an efficient method to solve these problems. In DCR-MAC [21], the cooperative <b>sensing</b> <b>is</b> used for solving the hidden PU problem. In CSS-RA [54], <b>sensing</b> errors <b>are</b> reduced by cooperative sensing.

5|$|Although {{there are}} {{a wide range of}} {{attachment}} difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such. A disorder in the clinical <b>sense</b> <b>is</b> a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations. The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Cooperative {{wide-band}} spectrum <b>sensing</b> has <b>been</b> {{considered to}} enable cognitive radio operation of wireless regional area networks (WRAN) in the UHF and VHF TV broadcasting bands.

The speed {{and accuracy of}} spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>are</b> improved by further optimization of the compressed <b>sensing</b> receiver, which <b>is</b> done blindly without any prior knowledge of the sensed signal. Enhanced compressed spectrum <b>sensing</b> algorithms <b>are</b> proposed for the cases of individual spectrum sensing and cooperative spectrum sensing.

The ability to detect other stimuli beyond those governed by these most broadly recognized senses also exists, and these sensory modalities include temperature (thermoception), kinesthetic sense (proprioception), pain (nociception), balance (equilibrioception), vibration (mechanoreception), and various internal stimuli (e.g. the different chemoreceptors for detecting salt and carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood, or sense of hunger and sense of thirst).
