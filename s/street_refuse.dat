60|$|Then a {{reporter}} leaped aboard, and ere I could gasp held {{me in his}} toils. He pumped me exhaustively while I was getting ashore, demanding of all {{things in the world}} news about Indian journalism. It is an awful thing to enter a new land with a new lie on your lips. I spoke the truth to the evil-minded Custom House man who turned my most sacred raiment on a floor composed of stable refuse and pine splinters; but the reporter overwhelmed me not so much by his poignant audacity as his beautiful ignorance. I am sorry now that I did not tell him more lies as I passed into a city of three hundred thousand white men. Think of it! Three hundred thousand white men and women gathered in one spot, walking upon real pavements in front of plate-glass-windowed shops, and talking something that at first hearing was not very different from English. It was only when I had tangled myself up in a hopeless maze of small wooden houses, dust, <b>street</b> <b>refuse,</b> and children who played with empty kerosene tins, that I discovered the difference of speech.|$|E
50|$|Before 1891, it {{is likely}} that Cripley Meadow was used for horse grazing, similar to Port Meadow, and also hay production. By March 1891, about 14 acres of the land was let to the North Oxford and Jericho Allotments Association for allotments. Over the {{following}} years, the city engineer organized the deposit of <b>street</b> <b>refuse</b> on the site to raise its level above the river.|$|E
50|$|Penguin {{is home to}} the Big Penguin, and all <b>street</b> <b>refuse</b> bins are {{decorated}} with ornamental cement fairy penguins.Mount Montgomery is also in the Penguin area. The Big Penguin, made of ferro cement by the Goliath Cement Co of Railton and later coated with fibreglass, is located in the town’s centre opposite the Post Office, and is the town’s most photographed icon. Unveiled on 25 October 1975, it was erected to commemorate the centenary of the naming of the town. Concerns were raised in 2008 as to the possibility of asbestos contamination, but the Big Penguin was given the all clear.|$|E

40|$|Urban runoff {{pollution}} potential {{can be linked}} to the constituents of street wastes as these wastes constitute the principal portion of runoff contaminants. This study was an attempt to correlate pollution associated with street litter with baseline quality data acquired in a previous study of Kalihi Stream. Correlations were made between street sweepings quality, length of street, land use, street surface characteristics, and rainfall intensity in order to estimate the concentration of pollutants in urban stormwater. The overall comparability of obtained estimates with existent stormwater quality data suggests the possibility of obtaining fairly acceptable quantification of {{pollution potential}} attributable to urban runoff by utilizing procedures described. However, the number of assumptions required leads to some inadequacies as reflected in inconsistencies in predicted BOD 5 and COD levels with actual field data.

50|$|On July 4, 1966 a {{crowd of}} African Americans {{gathered}} {{at the intersection of}} North 24th and Lake <b>Streets</b> <b>refused</b> to disband and reacted violently against the local police. Three days of rioting ensued, causing millions of dollars of damage to the North 24th Street corridor. A month later, on August 1, 1966, riots erupted again after a 19-year-old was shot by an off-duty white policeman during a burglary. Three buildings were firebombed, and 180 riot police were required to quell the crowds.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the largest}} local fire engines, which {{was brought to the}} scene on Gold Street, was itself {{destroyed}} in the fire, as burning debris fell from the houses either side. Henry Murray, who lived in one of Greenway's Almshouses on the <b>street,</b> <b>refused</b> to leave the building on the basis that he had never heard of an almshouse being burned down. Although the Almshouses had survived earlier fires in 1598 and 1612, it was destroyed in this fire and Murray died as a result.|$|R
50|$|The second Theatre Royal {{opened in}} Fountain Street on 12 July 1807 and was {{destroyed}} by fire on 7 March 1844. John Knowles took over the management of this second Theatre Royal some time before the fire, {{at a time when}} the theatre in Manchester was at its lowest ebb. Knowles set up a strong stock company and proved himself a very capable, though somewhat authoritarian, theatre manager. However, following the 1844 fire the proprietors of the theatre in Fountain <b>Street</b> <b>refused</b> to rebuild it.|$|R

A prisoner, Charles <b>Street,</b> <b>refused</b> to undertake work breaking stones, as {{he had not been}} sentenced to hard labour. He protested, and used foul language, for which he was arrested and charged. While he was incarcerated, 75 prisoners mutinied, refusing to follow any instructions until Street's release. Superintendent George accepted an apology by Street to resolve the incident. The Sunday Times derided George for conceding {{to the demands of the}} mutineers, rather than using [...] "armed force and … the loss of human life if necessary".|$|R

However, due to a fire in 1844, it was destroyed. The proprietors of the theatre in Fountain <b>Street</b> <b>refused</b> to rebuild it. At a public dinner, Knowles stated that if they could get no one else to build a theatre then he would do it himself. As a result, Knowles bought the patent rights and set about finding a site for the new theatre. Knowles had always been an admirer of theatrical performances and he was anxious to see their renovation in this, his native town. He desired to see the revival of the legitimate drama, and the plays represented in a manner duly worthy of them.|$|R
