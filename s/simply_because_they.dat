5|$|There {{are a few}} {{inconsistencies}} {{from the}} naturalist's view point. Foxes and badgers are not necessarily mutual enemies in nature. Badgers do not normally invade the homes of foxes, and are not typically dirty. Badgers do sometimes eat bunnies, not from a predilection for bunnies but <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are omnivorous. The inconsistencies are few and employed to create individual characters rather than evoke an archetypical fox and badger.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of musical}} {{instruments}} in worship was a divisive topic within the Stone-Campbell Movement from its earliest years, when some adherents opposed the practice on scriptural grounds, while {{others may have}} relied on a cappella <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> lacked access to musical instruments. Alexander Campbell opposed the use of instruments in worship. As early as 1855, some Restoration Movement churches were using organs or pianos, ultimately leading the Churches of Christ to separate from the groups that condoned instrumental music.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of this}} {{executive}} order is to help address questions about favoritism in city contracting by preventing conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of such conflicts.... There should be a level playing field, where no one has an advantage—or a disadvantage—in obtaining city contracts, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> know me or anyone else in government.... Under the steps I'm taking today and recommending to the City Council, the public can easily learn {{everything there is to}} know about a city contract: who is involved, who will benefit and whether the city is paying a fair price. I and every other city official must be prepared to defend every contract on its merits.|$|E
50|$|Abstention in {{compulsory}} voting systems {{tends to be}} somewhat ineffective, as the protest 'message' {{is likely to be}} confused with apathy. Voters who do not care who is elected, but are <b>simply</b> voting <b>because</b> <b>they</b> must, may choose to abstain, and the abstention protest votes will be confused with the apathetic abstention votes.|$|R
50|$|Wenner {{goes on to}} {{say that}} monarchs were found in Mexico in the winter <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> people {{expected}} <b>they</b> would be there. He contends that monarchs may be in other places, but just haven't been found yet.|$|R
50|$|Research {{shows that}} many Latinos in the United States do not {{identify}} as “American” but instead with their or their parents’ or grandparents’ country of origin. One {{of the reasons}} for this occurrence is the misbelief that in order to be an American, one needs to be White. Latinos who have experienced racial discrimination are more likely to identify as Latino or Latino American than <b>simply</b> American <b>because</b> <b>they</b> feel they are not treated as “real” Americans.|$|R
5|$|In late 1979 Taraki {{failed to}} assassinate Amin, who, in a revenge attack, {{successfully}} engineering Taraki's own assassination on 9 October. Later, in December, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan {{at the behest}} of Khan. On 27 December a KGB unit killed Amin. Babrak Karmal, the leader of the Parcham faction, was chosen by the Soviet leadership as Amin's successor {{in the aftermath of the}} Soviet intervention. Unfortunately for the Soviet leadership Karmal did not turn out to be the leader they expected, and he, just as his predecessors had arrested and killed several Parcham-members, arrested and killed several high-standing and low-standing Khalq members <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> supported the wrong faction. With Soviet troops still in the country, however, he was forced to bow to Soviet pressure, and released all Khalq prisoners. To make matters even worse for Karmal several of the previously arrested Khalq-members were forced to join the new government. At the time of Brezhnev's death, the Soviet Union was still bogged down in Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|During the war period, the Act gave an {{extraordinary}} {{power to the}} government and placed all foreigners in the country {{at the mercy of the}} government. All immigrants feared deportation because of either their political views or security reasons, or, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were regarded as an undesirable persons.|$|E
25|$|Losses were {{light on}} both sides despite the {{intensity}} of the fight. Several of the Union ships were hit, but none suffered severe damage. This was true for the Confederates also, aside from Curlew, but the remaining Mosquito Fleet had to retire <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> ran out of ammunition.|$|E
2500|$|In the March 2010 {{print edition}} of British enthusiast {{magazine}} EVO (p.120), editor Richard Meaden {{was the first}} to review the all-new right-hand-drive version of the Roadster. He said the car had [...] "serious, instantaneous muscle". [...] "With so much torque from literally no revs the acceleration punch is wholly alien. Away from traffic lights you'd murder anything, be it a 911 Turbo, GT-R or 599, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> while <b>they</b> have to mess about with balancing revs and clutch, or fiddle with launch controls and invalid warranties, {{all you have to do}} is floor the throttle and wave goodbye".|$|R
50|$|The passionist {{artists are}} {{concerned}} with the continuation of pre-avantgarde painting traditions without turning into a repetition of these works. They are not <b>simply</b> postmodernists <b>because</b> <b>they</b> actually take the content and the techniques of these traditional paintings seriously. The content focuses on narratives of riddles, yearning, and solemnity. That does not mean they lack humour, but their paintings are meant to be taken seriously. There is a tendency to create very dark paintings hence the title black pictures. Furthermore, they often comment on the doctrines of the modern and postmodern art and art theories, moving beyond these rigid constraints.|$|R
2500|$|Like his parents, Dmitry was musical; {{he had a}} {{particular}} love for Russian church music. In later years, he often sang in the chapel choirs at Strelna, the Marble Palace and the Pokrovsky Convent in Kiev. Duty stood {{at the core of}} his being and he was fiercely critical of a system, which pushed members of the Imperial family forward <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> of who <b>they</b> were. He believed that their promotions should be earned ...|$|R
25|$|Souter also {{disagrees with}} the Court's {{rejection}} of Ex parte Young, noting that where Chilicky was {{a rejection of the}} extra-statutory remedy proposed, Young was merely a jurisdictional device. Souter found it implausible that Congress would wish to see their statute made completely unenforceable <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had included a remedy for those injured by the failure of states to abide by it.|$|E
25|$|On 13 July 2006, Italian {{magazine}} Chi published photographs showing Diana {{amid the}} wreckage of the car crash, despite an unofficial blackout on such photographs being published. The editor of Chi defended his decision by saying he published the photographs <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had not been previously seen, and he felt the images were not disrespectful to the memory of Diana.|$|E
25|$|The {{tests have}} narrowed the {{curriculum}} {{to a lot}} of schools, usually squeezing out classes such as art and music <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are excluded in the tests, then they are wiped out of the curriculum. Teachers are then forced to teach subjects that only influence the literacy level and comprehension ability of a student and leave out the ones that often require talent or skill.|$|E
50|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a {{considerable}} shift in the municipality’s economic structure. Many agricultural businesses have <b>simply</b> been forsaken <b>because</b> <b>they</b> did not have the financial wherewithal to modernize and expand. Furthermore, agriculture is not attracting much new blood. It would seem that few young people nowadays want to become farmers. Most workers today commute to jobs in nearby towns and villages.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{described}} as a subspecies of the greater long-nosed bat, it was later considered a subspecies of the southern long-nosed bat, before being confirmed as a distinct species. Enthusiasts for the bats often refer to them <b>simply</b> as leptos <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are the best known members of the genus Leptonycteris. The scientific name {{is derived from the}} type locality, near Yerbabuena in Guerrero, Mexico.|$|R
5000|$|Ranks that do {{not speak}} at a unison or octave pitch, but rather at a non-octave {{interval}} to the unison pitch, are called mutation stops (or, <b>simply,</b> [...] "mutations"). <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> sound at intervals other than an octave (2:1 ratio) above or below the unison sound, they are rarely used on their own; rather, they are combined with unison stops to create different tone colors.|$|R
25|$|Until {{the middle}} of the 19th century, there was no {{standardization}} of surnames in the Philippines. There were native Filipinos without surnames, others whose surnames deliberately did not match that of their families, {{as well as those who}} took certain surnames <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had a certain prestige, usually ones related to the Roman Catholic religion, such as de los Santos ("of the saints") and de la Cruz ("of the cross").|$|E
25|$|The legal {{circumstances}} {{regarding the}} Stolen Generations remain unclear. Although some compensation claims are pending, a court cannot rule {{on behalf of}} plaintiffs <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were removed, because, at the time, such removals were authorised under Australian law. Australian federal and state governments' statute law and associated regulations provided for the removal from their birth families and communities of known mixed-race Aboriginal children, or those who visibly appeared mixed.|$|E
25|$|Also {{owing to}} the nature of how {{scientific}} knowledge has unfolded, proteins and their corresponding genes often have several names and symbols that are synonymous. Some of the earlier ones may be deprecated in favor of newer ones, although such deprecation is voluntary. Some older names and symbols live on <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have been widely used in the scientific literature (including before the newer ones were coined) and are well established among users.|$|E
50|$|Consumer {{advocacy}} groups argue that discrimination against consumers—the charging of higher {{prices on the}} same object <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> of where <b>they</b> happen to live—is unjust and monopolistic behaviour {{on the part of}} corporations towards the public. Since it requires governments to legislate to prevent their citizens from purchasing goods at cheaper prices from other markets, and because this is clearly not in their citizens' interests, many governments in democratic countries have chosen not to protect anti-competitive technologies such as DVD region-coding.|$|R
5000|$|... 'What social theorists call [...] "detraditionalization" [...] - the {{tendency}} of advancing capitalism to disrupt the cultures and traditions that may {{stand in the way}} of the accumulation of profit' has been seen as underpinning behind the self-help phenomenon in two (overlapping) ways. The first is the eclipse of the informal, communitarian transmission of folkways and folk wisdom: 'the charge that when self-help writers are being simplistic and repetitious, they are also being banal and unoriginal, merely offering their readers platitudes...on behalf of the best parts of folk wisdom', may <b>simply</b> be <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are providing a formal conduit for the conveyance of such [...] "home truths" [...] in an increasingly unstructured and anomic world.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} S {{units of the}} {{subunits}} (or the rRNAs) cannot <b>simply</b> be added <b>because</b> <b>they</b> represent measures of sedimentation rate rather than of mass. The sedimentation rate of each subunit is affected by its shape, {{as well as by}} its mass. The nt units can be added as these represent the integer number of units in the linear rRNA polymers (for example, the total length of the human rRNA = 7216 nt).|$|R
25|$|Although the SPGB {{claim to}} follow Marx's precepts, {{they claim to}} follow them <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are correct in their own right, not because Marx was a special individual, {{sometimes}} quoting his own contention that Je ne suis pas marxiste (I am not a Marxist). They do, however, often challenge {{the use of the}} term Marxist in the media, specifically when used to describe guerrilla and terrorist movements that have nothing to do with what the SPGB considers to be working-class socialist emancipation.|$|E
25|$|Chris Taylor {{believed}} that most modern strategy games were actually real-time tactics games, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> operated on too small a scale. His stated intention with Supreme Commander {{was to create}} a game that was strategy-focused by virtue of scale. Chris Taylor has stated that customisability was one of his goals for Supreme Commander, and that the game would ship the development team's tools if possible. The latter goal was not achieved. It should be noted, however, that they did put their map editing tools in the game files.|$|E
25|$|The King of Sicily's fame as {{an amateur}} painter {{formerly}} led to the optimistic attribution to him of many paintings in Anjou and Provence, in many cases <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> bore his arms. These works are generally in the Early Netherlandish style, and were probably executed under his patronage and direction, so {{that he may be}} said to have formed a school of the fine arts in sculpture, painting, goldsmith's work and tapestry. He employed Barthélemy d'Eyck as both painter and varlet de chambre for most of his career.|$|E
50|$|The {{nomenclature}} of rRNA subunits {{is derived}} from each component's Svedberg unit, which is an ultracentrifuge sedimentation coefficient, that is affected by mass and also shape. These S units of the rRNA subunits cannot <b>simply</b> be added <b>because</b> <b>they</b> represent measures of sedimentation rate rather than of mass. Eukaryotic ribosomes are somewhat larger and more complex than prokaryotic ribosomes. The overall 80S eukaryotic rRNA structure is composed of a large 60S subunit (LSU) and a small 40S subunit (SSU).|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I wonder Mr. Rushbrook don't {{look at it}} in that way. It is a {{shame that}} all these pretty things--and you know they are really good and valuable--shouldn't show what they are. But I suppose {{everybody}} here accepts the fact that this man <b>simply</b> buys them <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are valuable, and nobody interferes, and is content to humor him, laugh at him, and feel superior. It don't strike me as quite fair, does it you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Jim Rutenburg of The New York Times {{described}} the reporting {{style of the}} Free Beacon as [...] "gleeful evisceration." [...] Mother Jones magazine {{described the}} website as having [...] "built genuine muckraking success" [...] for breaking significant news stories. Commenting on the Free Beacons success at breaking news stories, The Washingtonians Andrew Beaujon wrote that, [...] "the Free Beacon regularly pounds out scoops any political reporter would envy. And many of its stories are difficult for their targets <b>simply</b> to dismiss, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> provide that rarest of internet wares: actual news." ...|$|R
25|$|It is {{said that}} {{the action of the}} Supreme Court of Illinois is {{contrary}} to the principles of that portion of the First Amendment which guarantees the free exercise of religion. Of course, under our Constitutional system, men could not be excluded from the practice of law, or indeed from following any other calling, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> belong to any of our religious groups, whether Protestant, Catholic, Quaker, or Jewish, assuming it conceivable that any state of the Union would draw such a religious line. We cannot say that any such purpose to discriminate motivated the action of the Illinois Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|Some loyalists {{claim the}} Kingsmill {{massacre}} {{is the reason}} they joined paramilitary groups. One was Billy Wright, who said:I was 15 when those workmen were pulled out of that bus and shot dead. I was a Protestant and I realised {{that they had been}} killed <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were Protestants. I left Mountnorris, came back to Portadown and immediately joined the youth wing of the UVF. He became commander of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade in the early 1990s; Wright later founded the breakaway Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) in 1996. He was suspected of at least 20 sectarian killings of Catholics in the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Producers {{organize}} and strive for Fair Trade certification for several reasons, either through religious ties, wants for social justice, wants for autonomy, political liberalization, or <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> {{want to be}} paid more for their labor efforts and products. Farmers {{are more likely to}} identify with organic farming than Fair Trade farming practices because organic farming is a very visible way that these farmers are different than their neighbors and it actually influences the way they farm. They place a significant importance on natural growing methods. Fair Trade farmers {{are also more likely to}} attribute their higher paid prices to the quality of their products rather than fair market prices.|$|E
2500|$|Seymour {{expressed}} the group's motivation [...] "This event {{is not about}} Hunters & Collectors ... It's about contributing to the groundswell of generosity that has emerged in the community after the cataclysm that's been inflicted on people <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> of where <b>they</b> live. It's a very big Australian story and it's got a cultural dimension. It's a huge honour {{to be part of}} it". Hunters & Collectors performed a selection of their most popular songs over a 40-minute set, including an encore performance of [...] "The Slab". The Sound Relief concert, including the Hunters & Collectors set, was broadcast on Australian cable TV and FM radio, which was released on DVD.|$|R
30|$|A {{theoretical}} model by Manger (2013) captures this latter idea. In the model, workers {{differ in their}} productivity, but individual productivity {{does not depend on}} age. Workers are matched to firms whereby the individual productivities of workers can only be observed after they have been hired. Firms fire unproductive workers and retain productive workers as long as possible. The probability that an imperfect matching process has sorted workers according to their productivity into the correct employment status increases with individual age. Thus, the older a productive worker, the higher the probability that he or she has already been matched to a good firm. Younger workers may be <b>simply</b> unemployed <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have not yet found a good job. However, those older workers who are unemployed {{are more likely to be}} unemployed <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are unproductive. As a consequence, there is a negative association between the age and the expected productivity of an unemployed worker. In this setting, firms have an incentive to statistically discriminate against older unemployed workers in the hiring decision.|$|R
50|$|HM 1 {{is noted}} for its components, {{including}} several Wolf-Rayet stars and Of stars. Both types of stars are fairly rare and very massive, and their coexistence in star clusters was unexpected. The evolution of Wolf-Rayet stars and Of stars in star clusters is currently unclear. Very few Wolf-Rayet stars {{have been found in}} star clusters, and a possible explanation is that the formation of these cluster Wolf-Rayet stars requires a binary star system containing two Of stars. Alternatively, cluster Wolf-Rayet stars may <b>simply</b> be rare <b>because</b> <b>they</b> represent a short stage in the evolution of Of stars, whether single or binary.|$|R
