40|$|The {{effect of}} binding Tb(3 +) to sodium taurocholate {{aggregates}} containing polyaromatic hydrocarbon guests was examined using pyrene and 1 -ethylnaphthalene as guests that bind {{to the primary}} aggregate, and 1 -naphthyl- 1 -ethanol as a <b>secondary</b> <b>aggregate</b> guest. Time-resolved fluorescence quenching studies were used to study the binding site properties, while laser flash photolysis quenching studies provided information on {{the dynamics of the}} guest-aggregate system. Both the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>aggregate</b> binding sites became more compact in the presence of bound Tb(3 +), while only the primary aggregate became more accessible to anionic molecules. The binding dynamics for the guest-primary aggregate system became faster when Tb(3 +) was bound to the aggregate. In contrast, for the guest-secondary aggregate the presence of Tb(3 +) resulted in a small decrease in the dissociation rate constant. The influence of bound Tb(3 +) on the primary and secondary bile salt aggregates is significantly different, which affects how these aggregates can be used as supramolecular host systems to modify guest reactivity.

40|$|Recycled {{concrete}} aggregate is considered {{as the most}} abundant and used <b>secondary</b> <b>aggregate</b> in concrete production, other types of solid waste are also being used in concrete for specific purposes and to achieve some desired properties. Recycled aggregates and particularly, recycled {{concrete aggregate}} substantially affect the properties and mix design of concrete both at fresh and hardened states since it is known by high porosity due to the adhered layer of old mortar on the aggregate which results in a high water absorption of the recycled <b>secondary</b> <b>aggregate.</b> This leads to lower density and strength, and other durability related properties. The use of most recycled aggregate in concrete structures is still limited to low strength and non-structural applications due to important drop in strength and durability performances generated. Embedding recycled aggregates in concrete is now a current practice in many countries to enhance sustainability of concrete industry and reduce its environmental impacts. The present paper discusses the various possible recycled aggregates used in concrete production, their effect on both fresh and hardened properties as well as durability performances. The economic and environmental impacts of partially or fully substituting natural aggregates by secondary recycled aggregates are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>aggregate</b> can be {{made from}} {{industrial}} waste by treatment with carbon dioxide gas (accelerated carbonation). Trials were conducted on bauxite waste, biomass ashes, metal dusts, quarry fines, steel-making waste, and the ashes arising from municipal incineration, paper recycling, sewage sludge incineration, and coal fired power stations. The wastes were formed into pellets using a combined pelletising and accelerated carbonation process with patent pending. The manufactured pellets conformed to the bulk density requirements for lightweight aggregate specified by British Standard. Specification for lightweight aggregate is limited, and two commercial lightweight aggregates were tested alongside the manufactured pellets for comparison. Compressive strength, water absorption and apparent density of the materials were comparable to that of the commercial aggregate. Furthermore, the finished product contained up to 11 % of its own weight in carbon dioxide gas, permanently bound as solid minerals. In a series of on-site pilot scale demonstrations, aggregates have been produced in bulk and used in commercial product trials.

40|$|Thermal {{aggregation}} of {{bovine serum}} albumin (BSA) {{has been studied}} using dynamic light scattering, asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation and analytical ultracentrifugation. The {{studies were carried out}} at fixed temperatures (60 °C, 65 °C, 70 °C and 80 °C) in 0. 1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7. 0, at BSA concentration of 1 mg/ml. Thermal denaturation of the protein was studied by differential scanning calorimetry. Analysis of the experimental data shows that at 65 °C the stage of protein unfolding and individual stages of protein aggregation are markedly separated in time. This circumstance allowed us to propose the following mechanism of thermal aggregation of BSA. Protein unfolding results in the formation of two forms of the non-native protein with different propensity to aggregation. One of the forms (highly reactive unfolded form, Uhr) is characterized by a high rate of aggregation. Aggregation of Uhr leads to the formation of primary aggregates with the hydrodynamic radius (Rh, 1) of 10. 3 nm. The second form (low reactive unfolded form, Ulr) participates in the aggregation process by its attachment to the primary aggregates produced by the Uhr form and possesses ability for self-aggregation with formation of stable small-sized aggregates (Ast). At complete exhaustion of Ulr, <b>secondary</b> <b>aggregates</b> with the hydrodynamic radius (Rh, 2) of 12. 8 nm are formed. At 60 °C the rates of unfolding and aggregation are commensurate, at 70 °C the rates of formation of the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>aggregates</b> are commensurate, at 80 °C the registration of the initial stages of aggregation is complicated by formation of large-sized aggregates...|$|R

The paper presented analysis of economic situation in the region and results of the study of screened waste materials in order to increase efficiency of an application of that product as fine aggregate and fine-ground active filler for a production of fine aggregate concretes. Particle size distribution, mineral and chemical composition of waste crushed concrete were studied, as well as features of their structure, taking into account heterogeneity of crushed material. Transitional zone of <b>secondary</b> <b>aggregate</b> and cement matrix was studied and it was proved, that the strength of adhesion with cement matrix of grains of that kind of secondary material, produced from screenings of waste crushed concrete, is significantly higher, than strength of the grain itself, which is indicative of an active influence of that aggregate on a formation of both characteristics of structure of cement matrix and dense transitional zone between them.

40|$|International audienceNanoparticles play an {{important}} role in controlling the mobility of pollutants such as arsenic (As) in the environment. In natural waters, aggregates of nanoparticles can be constituted of organic matter (OM) associated with iron (Fe). However, little is known about their network structure, especially the role of each component in the resulting aggregate morphology. This network structure can be of major importance for the metal and metalloid sorption processes. We synthesized an aggregate model of nanoparticles by varying the Fe/organic carbon (OC) ratio (R). By coupling small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering (SANS, SAXS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we revealed the fractal organization of Fe (i. e. primary beads forming a nanoparticle called an intermediate aggregate and then forming a <b>secondary</b> <b>aggregate</b> of nanoparticles). As the aggregate size increases with R, the As adsorption rate increases at a constant As/Fe ratio. Two hypotheses were considered: with increasing R, i) the repulsion interactions between the nanoparticles increase, inducing a structure opening, and ii) the Fe part size increases more strongly and is more ramified than the OM part, leading to a decrease of the coating by OM. Both hypotheses involve an increase in the number of available As binding sites. This study offers new perspectives on the impact of the network structure of heterogeneous nano-aggregates on their sorption capacity and could explain some metal/metalloid sorption variations observed in natural samples with variations in Fe/OC ratios...|$|E
40|$|Ninety {{five percent}} of the {{construction}} and demolition waste is recycled in the Netherlands. Most of it is used for low value applications such as road base materials; the use of secondary material in buildings is still less than 3 % 7. In order to recover waste for higher value applications, enhancing selective demolition and waste management practices is of crucial importance. In this study Life Cycle Assessment and Life Cycle Costing of a demolition project in Almere was carried out to identify the environmental and financial hotspots in the selective demolition and waste management in the Dutch context. Results suggest that (1) the best practice selective demolition and (2) the substitution of virgin concrete aggregate with <b>secondary</b> <b>aggregate</b> processed by Advanced Dry Recovery (ADR) system, will lead to environmental and financial improvements compared to the business as usual practice. On the building level, the advantage is mainly due to connecting the demolition and the re-development projects, which maximizes local reuse of old building components in the new building. The key of success for selective demolition is pre-audit to identify and connect to the market for material reuse. This is a direction that BIM (building information modeling) technology can contribute.

40|$|This thesis reports {{experimental}} work, {{carried out}} as a PhD study, investigating the possible re-use of glassy secondary materials as aggregate in concrete. A study of the relevant literature suggested that slag from the Imperial Smelting Furnace method of zinc production (ISF slag) and Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) glass from end of life computer monitors and television screens would be promising materials to test. The main issues identified as being of most concern relating {{to the use of}} these materials were the potential for alkali-silica reaction (ASR) due to the glassy nature of the aggregate materials, in-service leaching of heavy metal ions, namely lead, zinc and barium from the aggregates and the possibility of a delay in set caused by the addition of these materials to concrete or mortar mixes. A comprehensive study has been completed that has included characterisation of the <b>secondary</b> <b>aggregate</b> materials, their incorporation into concrete mixes and their effect on ASR, leaching and retardation of concrete set.

Comparison is made at all times with other FGG material, namely Hasopor, and other lightweight by-product manufactured material namely Lytag.

The programme of work was designed to establish benchmarking level for coarse and fine GFGG and to provide simple practical guidelines for its use in concrete. The research has identified some of the key practical and application issues for utilising GGFG in concrete. The physical characteristics of GFGG were found to be comparable, and in some cases superior, to those obtained for currently available manufactured lightweight secondary aggregates.

OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary predefined aggregate clinical outcomes: any end point or deaths related to diabetes and all cause mortality. <b>Secondary</b> <b>aggregate</b> outcomes: myocardial infarction, stroke, amputation (including death from peripheral vascular disease), and microvascular disease (predominantly retinal photo-coagulation). Single end points: non-fatal heart failure and cataract extraction. Risk reduction associated with a 1 % reduction in updated mean HbA(1 c) adjusted for possible confounders at diagnosis of diabetes. RESULTS: The incidence of clinical complications was significantly associated with glycaemia. Each 1 % reduction in updated mean HbA(1 c) was associated with reductions in risk of 21 % for any end point related to diabetes (95 % confidence interval 17 % to 24 %, P< 0. 0001), 21 % for deaths related to diabetes (15 % to 27 %, P< 0. 0001), 14 % for myocardial infarction (8 % to 21 %, P< 0. 0001), and 37 % for microvascular complications (33 % to 41 %, P< 0. 0001).

The dual exponential decay kinetics above 10 mM NaC concentration showed that the probe resided in two totally different binding sites. At 2 - 10 mM NaC concentrations, only primary aggregates were detected.

40|$|The {{computational}} {{design of}} new and interesting inorganic materials is still an ongoing challenge. The motivation of these efforts is to aid the often difficult task of crystal structure determination, to rationalize different but related structure types, or to help limit the domain of structures that are possible in a given system. Over the past decade, simulation methods have continuously evolved towards the prediction of new structures using minimal input information in terms of symmetry, cell parameters, or chemical composition. So far, this task of identifying candidate structures through {{an analysis of the}} energy landscape of chemical systems has been particularly successful for predominantly ionic systems with relatively small numbers of atoms or ions in the simulation cell. After an introductory section, the second section of this work presents the historical developments of such simulation methods in this area. The following sections of the work are dedicated to the introduction of the building unit concept in simulation methods: we present simulation approaches to structure prediction employing both primary (aggregate of atoms) and <b>secondary</b> (<b>aggregate</b> of coordination polyhedra) building units. While structure prediction with primary units is a straightforward extension of established approaches, the AASBU method (automated asssembly of secondary building units) focusses on the topology of network-based structures. This method explores the possible ways to assemble predefined inorganic building units in three-dimensional space, opening the way to the manipulation of very large building units (up to 84 atoms in this work). As illustrative examples we present the prediction of candidate structures for Li 4 CO 4, the identification of topological relationships within a family of metalphosphates, ULM-n and MIL-n, and finally the generation of new topologies by using predefined large building units such as a sodalite or a double-four-ring cage, for the prediction {{of new and}} interesting zeolite-type structures...|$|E

Research {{in the use of}} waste tyre in the form of crumb rubber and powder obtained after processing, specifically for pavement engineering applications, has increased over the decades due to the engineering and mechanical properties it can bring into the pavement surfaces. These include improved durability, better service quality, and reduced noise compared to the use of tradition all primary aggregates, such as crushed rock, gravel, etc. Through years of research, the experts and researchers identified that, although, waste rubber improves the mechanical behaviour of rubberised bituminous surfaces, yet, there exist issues that need addressing. This PhD research work focuses on improving the properties of the waste tyre rubber aggregates obtained from scrap tyres for various rubberised bituminous surface applications. It identifies the issues and knowledge gap, which are related to the performance of the waste tyre aggregates in bituminous mixes and the service life of the product. However, current research has identified one of the major issues related to the interaction between the rubber and bitumen at elevated temperatures higher than 140 °C. When the rubber and bitumen interacts at higher temperatures, it results in the diffusion of light fractions (maltenes, or specifically aromatic oils) from bitumen into rubber and the rubber swells by 3 - 5 times its original volume. The bitumen becomes hard and brittle due to the lower percentage of light fractions left compared to the heavy fractions and the rubber loses its bonding in the bituminous mixes due to the swelling which leads to breaking of the bonding and subsequently short service life of rubberised pavements. This research focuses specifically on the reduction in the absorption properties of waste rubber after its interaction with bitumen to produce highly durable material.

The aggregates under investigation, originated from construction and demolition sites of the Greater London area and were mainly from reinforced concrete structures {{dating back to the}} 60 's- 70 's. The study investigated three sources of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA I, RCA II and RCA III). The first step in the investigation involved the characterisation of the aggregates through an extensive testing regime including physical, mechanical and chemical-mineralogical assessments. Aggregates where then classified based on the requirements of BS 8500 and BSEN 12620 which provide the main guidance for aggregates for concrete. All sources conformed to the relevant standard requirements and RCA I was selected for the next step of this investigation. Following the establishment of conformity of these aggregates for concrete production a further in depth investigation involved the production of designated concrete mixes conforming to BS 8500 and BSEN 206 using coarse RCA I at various proportions up to 100...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Protein misfolding and {{subsequent}} aggregation are hallmarks of several human diseases. The cell has {{a variety of}} mechanisms for coping with misfolded protein stress, including ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. In fact, the presence of ubiquitin at protein aggregates is a common feature of protein misfolding diseases. Ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (UBCs) are part of the cascade of enzymes responsible for the regulated attachment of ubiquitin to protein substrates. The specific UBC used during ubiquitination can determine the type of polyubiquitin chain linkage, which in turn {{plays an important role in}} determining the fate of the ubiquitinated protein. Thus, UBCs may serve an important role in the cellular response to misfolded proteins and the fate of protein aggregates. Results The Q 82 strain of C. elegans harbors a transgene encoding an aggregation prone tract of 82 glutamine residues fused to green fluorescent protein (Q 82 ::GFP) that is expressed in the body wall muscle. When measured with time-lapse microscopy in young larvae, the initial formation of individual Q 82 ::GFP aggregates occurs in approximately 58 minutes. This process is largely unaffected by a mutation in the C. elegans E 1 ubiquitin activating enzyme. RNAi of ubc- 22, a nematode homolog of E 2 - 25 K, resulted in higher pre-aggregation levels of Q 82 ::GFP and a faster initial aggregation rate relative to control. Knockdown of ubc- 1 (RAD 6 homolog), ubc- 13, and uev- 1 did not affect the kinetics of initial aggregation. However, RNAi of ubc- 13 decreases the rate of secondary growth of the aggregate. This result is consistent with previous findings that aggregates in young adult worms are smaller after ubc- 13 RNAi. mCherry::ubiquitin becomes localized to Q 82 ::GFP aggregates during the fourth larval (L 4) stage of life, a time point long after most aggregates have formed. FLIP and FRAP analysis indicate that mCherry::ubiquitin is considerably more mobile than Q 82 ::GFP within aggregates. Conclusions These data indicate that initial formation of Q 82 ::GFP aggregates in C. elegans is not directly dependent on ubiquitination, but is more likely a spontaneous process driven by biophysical properties in the cytosol such as the concentration of the aggregating species. The effect of ubiquitination appears to be most significant in later, <b>secondary</b> <b>aggregate</b> growth. </p...|$|E
40|$|Every 1 t {{of china}} clay {{produced}} in the UK generates 9 t of waste material. A limited quantity of the coarser waste has beneficial use as a building stone or <b>secondary</b> <b>aggregate</b> in concrete and asphalt, but there are currently limited uses for the finest waste fraction. ‘Mica’ waste {{is a mixture of}} fine minerals {{and is one of the}} forms of waste with little beneficial use other than the restoration of old quarries. Looking for innovative solutions for the needs of a new Eco-town in the UK and with an aim to find new commercially viable and low environmental impact uses in construction, this PhD introduces the idea of using the china clay waste in alkali-activated binders. First, it was investigated whether the contained mica mineral could be used as an alkali-activated binder. This was done using different MAS NMR and XRD analysis, and mechanical strength tests based on European standards. The material was shown to have low reactivity and some direct trials of alkali-activation of thermally treated mica mineral produced in average weak binders. Later, three series of alkali-activated binders were studied, one based on Ground Granulated Blastfurnace Slag (GGBS), one based on Fly Ash (FA) and one based on a 50 %GGBS- 50 %FA blend (50 / 50). The china clay waste was incorporated in selected optimum binders from the three series as aggregate to make mortars and concrete. Compared to control specimens, the test specimens using the china clay waste always showed lower strength. It is suggested that the high water demand of the waste is the main problem. When the waste was used in mortars, the impact of the water declined over time, with sand waste from china clay extraction showing approximately equivalent strength to the control silica based mortar after 6 months of curing for the GGBS and 50 / 50 series. For the same series, mica-waste specimens gave about 50 % of the strength of the control mortar on the 7 th day of curing but increased to 70 - 80 % of the control compressive strength at 6 months. In the FA series, the impact of additional water resulted in very low strengths and that series did not proceed in concrete making. The concrete design was accompanied by an environmental analysis to ensure environmentally beneficial outcomes were obtained. Testing in compression shows a similar decreasing strength for the Portland and the alkali-activated series for increasing amounts of waste used. However, the test specimens of the GGBS series showed potential for replacing Portland control specimens. The potential for making blocks and tiles using the new concrete would be greater if the mix design is optimized. Durability testing will be required on an optimized design and final product, but initial analysis of test results and the literature indicate this is unlikely to be a concern. Not using the final product to run durability tests would lead to arbitrary conclusions. The environmental analysis shows that although the carbon emissions would be reduced using alkali-activated concrete, most of the other environmental impact categories would be affected negatively which has to be considered when making the final decision on whether to use this new material in the Eco-town or elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|With the {{introduction}} of waste legislation, {{in the form of}} regulations and directives, {{in many parts of the}} world a significant move towards sustainable waste management is becoming a legal requirement. Emphasis is now being placed on increasing recycling and promoting more sustainable practices for waste materials, including glass. The present research, therefore, aimed at examining the feasibility of Foamed Glass Gravel (FGG) as construction material, in particular Geofil Foamed Glass Gravél (GFGG), a manufactured lightweight <b>secondary</b> <b>aggregate,</b> for use as a primary aggregate substitute in concrete production. Comparison is made at all times with other FGG material, namely Hasopor, and other lightweight by-product manufactured material namely Lytag. In the main, research was carried out in three distinct parts; Part 1 examining the key characteristics of GFGG (following relevant BS and BS EN standards), Part 2 assessing its suitability for use in concrete applications, and Part 3 providing practical implications of the findings. The programme of work was designed to establish benchmarking level for coarse and fine GFGG and to provide simple practical guidelines for its use in concrete. The research has identified some of the key practical and application issues for utilising GGFG in concrete. The physical characteristics of GFGG were found to be comparable, and in some cases superior, to those obtained for currently available manufactured lightweight secondary aggregates. The grading of GFGG was found to be almost within the limits of lightweight aggregates with similar voids ratio as that of NA. Typically, GFGG, rough in it's texture, could create better mechanical interlocking with cement paste than smooth aggregates. GFGG had 60 - 65 % lower bulk density, 40 - 50 % lower apparent particle density and water absorption 3 to 5 times higher than natural Thames Valley Gravel but still performed comparable to other lightweight aggregates. However it was found to have slightly higher density than Hasopor, but also higher heat and crushing resistance. Overall, characterisation test results showed that GFGG has a potential for use as quality lightweight aggregate in concrete production. However, it was noted that the precautions may be necessary to take account of bubble densities and water absorption characteristics to guarantee suitable fresh properties of concrete. In order to determine the practical upper limit of GFGG content for a range of applications and to assess the performance of GFGG concrete, mixes were proportioned using Natural Aggregate (NA) and GFGG bubbles blends with up to 60 % coarse or 15 % fine bubbles- by volume. The general trends observed indicate comparable workability with inclusion of GFGG in concrete mixes and slump loss with time was not adversely affected. Results of compressive strength testing showed that up to 30 % coarse or 15 % fine GFGG had negligible effect on the cube and cylinder strength of concrete and using up to 15 % fine GFGG caused a slight increase in cube, cylinder and other engineering properties. Moreover, within 3 -days 30 % coarse GFGG and (5 - 15 %) fíne GFGG concrete mixes achieved on average 73 % of 28 -day compressive strength. This increased to 85 % within 7 days, regardless of GFGG content when compared to NA (Control) concrete mixes. However, results show gradual reduction in strength with an increase in GFGG content beyond 30 % coarse in the mix. Indeed, the results showed that such reduction in strength with high GFGG proportions can be compensated for by adjusting the mix water/cement ratio. The results also showed that the original glass source had a negligible effect on fresh and key bulk engineering properties of resulting concrete. The subject of GFGG concrete durability study included initial surface absorption, carbonation rates and alkali-silica reaction testing. In general, GFGG concrete mixes were found to posses near surface absorption properties similar to the corresponding NA concrete mixes, providing GFGG content was restricted to 30 % coarse or 15 % fme. Carbonation rates for up to 60 % GFGG mixes were comparable to NA mixes. Results of accelerated ASR testing of 30 - 100 % fine GFGG mortar prisms indicated that none of the tested samples expanded significantly during the test and that damaging deleterious expansion due to ASR did not occurred during testing. The practical implications of the study to the construction industry are also discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 {{materials were}} investigated: smaller primary particle size forming large <b>secondary</b> particle <b>aggregates</b> (LTO-SP, surface area 22 m 2 /g) and larger primary particle size with less <b>secondary</b> particle <b>aggregates</b> (LTO-LP, surface area 7 m 2 /g). Both samples were synthesized {{using the same}} high temperature solid state synthesis but different end processing, resulting in same crystalline structure but different particle morphology. At 0. 1 C measured discharge capacities were close to the theoretical capacity of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (175 mAh/g) and similar capacities were obtained at low C-rates and room temperature for both LTO-SP and LTO-LP. However, higher capacities were obtained with LTO-SP at high C-rates and - 20 °C indicating beneficial effect of small particle size and large surface area. Shapes of the charge/discharge curves were different for LTO-SP and LTO-LP and this is attributed to the large surface area of LTO-SP which affects the electrochemical performance because of different reaction potentials at surface sites vs. bulk.

40|$|The {{building}} {{sector is}} still largely dominated by recourse to natural resources with growing consumes: the necessary request of natural aggregates generate a strong {{impact on the}} territory because of extractive activities. The growing attention and interest towards the environment led to a wider interest in reusing and recycling building materials. Consequently {{it is necessary to}} pay attention on the contribution that the <b>secondary</b> <b>aggregates</b> may lead to the satisfaction of the building society needs. For this reason it is necessary evaluate the environmental bounders associated to the necessary industrial operation to obtain the secondary raw materials, with respect the natural aggregates, obtained from extractive activities. To investigate the environmental performance of both secondary raw materials and natural aggregates it is important to adopt the life cycle approach. A product is usually defined as eco-friendly when it is solely composed by recycled materials, since the consumption of raw materials and the production of waste are limited. However, in this way, it cannot taken into account of the energy consumption during the reprocessing, that often reduces the advantage of the raw material savings...|$|R
40|$|The {{idiosyncrasy}} of movement: GIS as a {{tool for}} exploring individual differences The concept of individual differences continues to gain considerable attention within the discipline of psychology. A recent workshop at the 2006 Spatial Cognition conference (in Bremen, Germany) made evident that much can be learned by focusing on the individual and the particularities of both planned and unplanned navigation. Individuals vary in their ability to learn and navigate large-scale environments. These differences however are often treated as <b>secondary,</b> <b>aggregated</b> and at times even forfeited for statistical significance testing. Researchers in geography, especially those dealing with behaviour and movement, must take care to partake in this discussion and continue to develop analytical methods that can account for the heterogeneity of human spatial behaviour. Researchers (Tellevik, 1992; Hill 1993) have used different video coding techniques to analyse and identify patterns and strategies used to explore familiar and unfamiliar environments. Most of these techniques require the recording of movement with a video camera and the isolation of different exploratory strategies by reviewing the recording as...|$|R
