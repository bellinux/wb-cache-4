Histologists are challenged both by the availability of biopsy tissue not previously obtainable and by the opportunity to closely correlate clinical symptoms with microscopic patterns of injury. Additional challenge stems from the necessity to evaluate biopsies which, although more numerous, are generally smaller, less well oriented, and more subject to artefact than the larger biopsies formerly obtained by rigid endoscopes.

40|$|At {{the start}} of this {{interview}} Sir Francis Avery Jones, pioneering consultant gastroenterologist, talks of his childhood and education in Suffolk, his medical training at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and house jobs on the medical unit there with Sir Francis Fraser, Leslie Witts and Ronald Christie. He acknowledges that Leslie Witts sparked his interest in gastroenterology. Sir Francis then summarises his wartime employment as a physician interested in dietetics at the Central Middlesex Hospital with Horace Joules, where he was soon in charge of the hospital's wartime medical arrangements, and kept records on haematemesis and ulcer patients. He speaks of the greater scope for innovation in a district rather than a teaching hospital, and his position as honorary consulting gastroenterologist at St Mark's Hospital which contributed to a growing interest in surgical cases and postoperative care, and problems of the lower bowel. Next, Sir Francis outlines developments in investigative techniques in gastroenterology over time, including the development of more flexible <b>sigmoidoscopes</b> and gastroscopes for endoscopic examination, and the resulting rapid expansion of research. The interview then moves on to gastronterological research at the Central Middlesex: the work of the MRC Gastroenterological Unit - mainly on ulcers - under the directorship of Eirwyn Rowlands, the contribution of David Silk and Jerzy Jacek Misiewicz, and the greater focus on nutrition from the 1970 s. A more detailed discussion on the relationship between diet and disease follows. Sir Francis then describes the work of the Society of Gastroenterology, which he was involved in from its inception in 1937, and particularly the vision and motivations of the founder Sir Arthur Hurst. In the final section of the interview he reflects on the importance of applying new technologies and interdisciplinary collaboration in the development of gastroenterology, identifies nutrition and the role of hormones in the gut as priorities for future research, and describes his work with the King's Fund.

50|$|For the procedure, {{the patient}} must lie {{on his or}} her left side on the {{examining}} table. The physician inserts a short, flexible, lit tube into the rectum and slowly guides it into the colon. The tube is called a <b>sigmoidoscope.</b> The scope transmits an image of the inside of the rectum and colon, so the physician can carefully examine the lining of these organs. The scope also blows air into these organs, which inflates them and helps the physician see better.|$|E
50|$|Doctors can {{diagnose}} proctitis {{by looking}} inside the rectum with a proctoscope or a <b>sigmoidoscope.</b> A biopsy is taken, {{in which the}} doctor scrapes a tiny piece of tissue from the rectum, and this tissue is then examined by microscopy. The physician may also take a stool sample to test for infections or bacteria. If the physician suspects that the patient suffers from Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, colonoscopy or barium enema X-rays are used to examine areas of the intestine.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{cause of}} this {{condition}} is not known. Patients usually present with clinical features of colonic obstruction. Vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain, blood stained stools are frequent symptoms. It is difficult to diagnose this condition before surgery. Raveenthiran described a triad which {{may be useful in}} preoperative diagnosis. The triad includes 1). Clinical features suggestive of small bowel obstruction, 2). Radiological features suggestive of large bowel obstruction, 3). Inability to negotiate <b>sigmoidoscope</b> or a flatus tube. This is a surgical emergency that requires urgent resection of gangrenous bowel and untwisting of the volvulus.|$|E
5000|$|For {{performing}} the examination, the patient must {{lie on the}} left side, in the so-called Sims' position. The bowels are previously emptied with a suppository, and a digital rectal examination is first performed. The <b>sigmoidoscope</b> is lubricated and inserted with [...] in {{general direction of the}} navel. The direction is then changed and the obturator is removed so that the physician may penetrate further with direct vision. A bellows is used to insufflate air to distend the rectum. Lateral movements of the sigmoidoscope's tip negotiate the Houston valve and the recto-sigmoid junction.|$|E

Similarly, we used MEI in an open study to evaluate two thin prototype endoscopes (Olym-pus MS 230 I and XCFSEV- Figures 1 a, 1 b) in symptomatic subjects [4]. These thinner and “flop-pier ” endoscopes appeared to offer advantages over a standard 60 cm flexible <b>sigmoidoscope</b> [4].

40|$|The {{flexible}} fiber-optic <b>sigmoidoscope</b> {{is rapidly}} replacing the rigid <b>sigmoidoscope</b> in routine screening for colorectal cancer. This study was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} safety, usage pattern, and efficacy of fiber-optic sigmoidoscopy by evaluating the outcome of training {{and the results of}} procedures carried out by a group of primary care physicians. Of 1, 153 participants in one-day flexible sigmoidoscopy workshops, 764 (66 %) returned questionnaires evaluating their experiences following this training. Of these, 438 physicians had obtained a flexible <b>sigmoidoscope,</b> used it frequently, and had done a total of 17, 167 examinations. The average time of scope usage was nine months. Although additional supervised training was suggested {{at the time of the}} workshop, 68 % of physicians began doing flexible sigmoidoscopy without it. A total of 465 polyps and 153 cancers were detected by the study group for an overall detection rate of 2. 7 % for polyps and 0. 9 % for cancers. Four complications were reported. This study indicates that the technique of flexible sigmoidoscopy is readily learned, is diagnostically productive, and is reasonably safe in the hands of primary care physicians...|$|E
40|$|The {{flexible}} fiberoptic <b>sigmoidoscope</b> {{has gained}} widespread acceptance as a diagnostic {{tool in the}} detection and diagnosis of colorectal disease. Since its introduction nearly a decade ago, studies have thus far indicated that {{in the hands of}} experienced physicians, flexible sigmoidoscopy is a safe procedure affording greater patient comfort, greater depth of insertion, and a higher yield of neoplastic lesions than rigid sigmoidoscopy, with surprisingly few associated risks. Although reported infrequently, infection is an acknowledged risk of flexible sigmoidoscopy and other endoscopic procedures. The most efficient means of preventing endoscopy-associated infection is uncompromising aseptic practice. Clinical and experimental data obtained from studies designed to investigate endoscopic transmission of infectious organisms and from our own and others' experiences are reviewed.

40|$|With Dr Evans letter (April Journal) I partly agree, {{and partly}} disagree. I omitted the haemo-globinometer and the {{microscope}} {{as being too}} obvious. They are both in constant use, the former mostly by our own practice nurses, the latter perhaps {{not so much as}} it would be if we did not have an excellent laboratory in close proximity with a daily delivery service. I would disagree with the statement that the " situation exists when the satisfaction of fully treating one's own patients is becoming a luxury which few doctors can afford". For instance, if Dr Evans would take down his <b>sigmoidoscope</b> from his cupboard, {{he would be able to}} diagnose and treat his own cases of proctitis (not such a very uncommon disease) and monitor their progress. Furthermore, in our area, no case is accepted for barium enema without prior sig-moidoscopy, so that this important investigation would be denied us without a <b>sigmoidoscope,</b> in my view quite correctly. I think that in these days when most general practitioners have access to an almost full range of diagnostic facilities, no case should be presented to a consultant at outpatients without having first been fully "worked up ". The consultant can then perform his proper function for consult-ation with all the apparently relevant facts available to him at the time...|$|E
40|$|Many {{hospitals}} {{now offer}} barium enema examinations to general practitioners {{on an open}} access basis, so bypassing the traditional sequence of first carrying out a sigmoidoscopy. An open access sigmoidoscopy/proctoscopy service was therefore opened with requests for a barium enema being denied unless preceded by sigmoidoscopy. During the first {{three and a half}} years 1458 patients referred direct from their general practitioners were examined using a rigid <b>sigmoidoscope.</b> Patients were also examined with a proctoscope if thought appropriate. After the first year of the service a subsequent examination with a fibreoptic <b>sigmoidoscope</b> was also carried out if the presenting symptom was bleeding for which no cause could be found with the rigid instruments. A total of 516 abnormalities were found to account for symptoms in 506 patients giving a diagnostic rate of 35 %. The most common lesion was piles (307 cases). Other relatively common disorders included inflammatory bowel disease (107 cases), benign tumours (44), and malignant tumours (38). Of 41 patients subsequently undergoing fibreoptic sigmoidoscopy a cause for the bleeding was found in 32, the most common being a malignant tumour (16). Most general practitioners in the district used the service and a questionnaire survey indicated that most found it very helpful. Requests from general practitioners for a barium enema fell substantially over the period...|$|E

30|$|The {{surgical}} rectum extends for 12 - 15  cm endoscopically {{from the}} anal verge. The {{length of the}} rectum {{is dependent on the}} size of the patients. In tall males the rectum can be 17 - 20  cm long and in women less than 15  cm. The exact length can be evaluated best on the sagittal plane. However, for simplicity, 15  cm measured with a rigid <b>sigmoidoscope</b> has been used as standard. The anatomical definition of the rectosigmoid junction is based on haustrations. Haustrations are present in the sigmoid colon and absent in the rectum. In fact, “rectum” refers to the straight portion of the colon in the sense that the rectum lacks haustrations. Otherwise the rectum is much less straight than the name implies. In patients with diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon, this junction is appreciated more readily, as diverticula (more accurately referred to as pseudo-diverticula) denote sigmoid colon and not rectum. On high-resolution MRI, the rectosigmoid junction is the location where the rectum becomes completely covered by peritoneum. This is appreciated ventral to the rectum where the peritoneal reflection is detected. The rectosigmoid junction is orientated obliquely towards the sacrum. The peritoneal reflection is sometimes located more distally in women with a deep Douglas pouch, than in men [23]. In summary, the upper distinction of the rectum is 15  cm above the anal verge based on the rigid <b>sigmoidoscope</b> as most previous studies have used this definition. However, the radiologist should inform the members of the multidisciplinary team when a tumour originates from a mobile portion of the colon with a mesentery root, as this may be of relevance for the radiation target.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Rigid {{sigmoidoscopy}} {{forms an}} integral part of the out-patient assessment of patients with colorectal symptoms. However, the value of this of this examination is often diminished by faecal loading of the rectum. This trial aimed to determine the ability of a single self-administered glycerine suppository to clear the rectum in preparation for rigid sigmoidoscopy, and considered patient acceptability of this practice. METHODS: Consecutive patients were randomly allocated to receive suppository or no suppository prior to out-patient rigid sigmoidoscopy. Assessment was made of patient compliance, the effectiveness of rectal examination, and the depth to which the <b>sigmoidoscope</b> was inserted. RESULTS: 131 patients were randomised into suppository (n = 66) or control groups (n = 65). The number of patients deemed to have good views of the rectum (> 75 % of rectal mucosa seen) was significantly greater in suppository than control groups (79 % versus 26. 2 %, P < 0. 05 Chi square test), whilst that of poor examinations (< 50 % of rectal mucosa seen) was significantly greater in control than suppository groups (44. 6 % versus 4 %, P < 0. 05). The depth of insertion of the <b>sigmoidoscope</b> was significantly greater in those receiving suppositories (54. 5 % versus 21. 5 % undergoing evaluation to 18 cm or more, P < 0. 05). Compliance amongst those who received suppositories was high with only 3 of 53 (4. 5 %) patients in the suppository group evaluated by questionnaire reporting difficulty or concerns over their use. CONCLUSION: Self-administered suppositories are acceptable to patients and significantly improve the efficiency of outpatient rigid sigmoidoscopy. Their usage should become routine...|$|E
