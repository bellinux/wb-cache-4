50|$|Fittings {{that are}} not allowed to slip are made to diameters that prevent {{slipping}} and consequently the mating surfaces cannot be brought into position without force. For small bearings this is best done with a press because tapping with a hammer damages both bearing and shaft, while for large bearings the necessary forces are so great that there is no alternative to heating one part before fitting, so that thermal expansion allows a temporary <b>sliding</b> <b>fit.</b>|$|E

5000|$|An {{example of}} such a design {{modification}} suffix is adding [...] "V" [...] or [...] "Z" [...] {{to the end of the}} part number to designate the variant of the part that is purchased [...] "less paint", [...] "less plating", [...] "with the holes not yet drilled", [...] "intentionally oversize by [...]01mm", or any of countless other modifications. The intent is usually that the feature in question (such as holes not yet drilled, or paint not yet sprayed) will be added at a higher assembly level; or that maintenance workers in the field will choose from a kit of undersize and oversize parts (such as bushings) in order to achieve a certain fit (<b>sliding</b> <b>fit,</b> light press fit, etc.).|$|E
5000|$|For example, if a shaft with {{a nominal}} {{diameter}} of 10 mm {{is to have}} a <b>sliding</b> <b>fit</b> within a hole, the shaft might be specified with a tolerance range from 9.964 to 10 mm (i.e. a zero fundamental deviation, but a lower deviation of 0.036 mm) and the hole might be specified with a tolerance range from 10.04 mm to 10.076 mm (0.04 mm fundamental deviation and 0.076 mm upper deviation). This would provide a clearance fit of somewhere between 0.04 mm (largest shaft paired with the smallest hole, called the [...] "maximum material condition") and 0.112 mm (smallest shaft paired with the largest hole). In this case the size of the tolerance range for both the shaft and hole is chosen to be the same (0.036 mm), meaning that both components have the same International Tolerance grade but this need not be the case in general.|$|E
5000|$|Nipples {{are also}} {{available}} separately from the cable, for purposes of repair or custom cable construction. They are fitted to the cable by soldering. Where free rotation of nipples, relative to the cable axis is required, the cable end may be finished with a brass ferrule or [...] "trumpet" [...] soldered to the cable. The barrel nipple will be a <b>sliding</b> <b>fit</b> over the brass ferrule, and can thus rotate, to ensure alignment of the nipples {{at each end of}} the cable, and avoidance of twisting of the inner cable. Applying heat to the inner cable for soldering may weaken the steel, and although soft soldering is less strong than silver solder, a lower temperature is required to form the joint, and there is less likelihood of the inner cable being damaged as a result. Silver soldering may require additional heat treatment of the wire to preserve the temper of it in order to prevent it from becoming too soft or too brittle ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the sliding and the {{vibrating}} fretting tests mechanism of h-BN micro-particles when used as a lubricating grease- 2 additive. Design/methodology/approach: The fretting tests were conducted on steel/steel contacts using both vibrating fretting apparatus and the shaftsleeve <b>slide</b> <b>fitted</b> tester. The wear scars were characterized with profilometry. The tribological properties of grease- 2 compounded with h-BN additive were also compared to those obtained for the commercial product Militec- 4. Findings: The experiment showed significant differences between the results obtained from the vibrating fretting and the shaft-sleeve <b>sliding</b> <b>fitted</b> tests. Adding h-BN to the lubricant leads to a better performance in the shaft-sleeve slide regime than in the steel/steel vibrating test condition. Originality/value: The results of the experimental studies demonstrate the potential of h-BN as an additive for preventing fretting sliding, and can very useful for further application of compound grease- 2 with h-BN additive in industrial equipment...|$|R

5000|$|The {{other main}} area of {{application}} for selective assembly is in contexts where total interchangeability is in fact achieved, but the [...] "fit and finish" [...] of the final products can be enhanced by minimizing the dimensional mismatch between mating parts. Consider another application {{similar to the one}} above with the 12 mm pin. But say that in this example, not only is the precision important (to produce the desired fit), but the accuracy is also important (because the 12 mm pin must interact with something else {{that will have to be}} accurately sized at 12 mm). Some of the implications of this example are that the rejection rate cannot be lowered; all parts must fall within tolerance range or be scrapped. So there are no savings to be had from salvaging oversize or undersize parts from scrap, then. However, there is still one bit of value to be had from selective assembly: having all the mated pairs have as close to identical <b>sliding</b> <b>fit</b> as possible (as opposed to some tighter fits and some looser fits—all sliding, but with varying resistance).|$|E
5000|$|In {{contexts}} {{where the}} application requires extremely tight (narrow) tolerance ranges, the requirement may push slightly past {{the limit of}} {{the ability of the}} machining and other processes (stamping, rolling, bending, etc.) to stay within the range. In such cases, selective assembly is used to compensate for a lack of total interchangeability among the parts. Thus, for a pin that must have a <b>sliding</b> <b>fit</b> in its hole (free but not sloppy), the dimension may be spec'd as 12.00 +0 −0.01 mm for the pin, and 12.00 +.01 −0 for the hole. Pins that came out oversize (say a pin at 12.003mm diameter) are not necessarily scrap, but they can only be mated with counterparts that also came out oversize (say a hole at 12.013mm). The same is then true for matching undersize parts with undersize counterparts. Inherent in this example is that for this product's application, the 12 mm dimension does not require extreme accuracy, but the desired fit between the parts does require good precision (see the article on accuracy and precision). This allows the makers to [...] "cheat a little" [...] on total interchangeability in order to get more value out of the manufacturing effort by reducing the rejection rate (scrap rate). This is a sound engineering decision as long as the application and context support it. For example, for machines {{for which there is no}} intention for any future field service of a parts-replacing nature (but rather only simple replacement of the whole unit), this makes good economic sense. It lowers the unit cost of the products, and it does not impede future service work.|$|E

40|$|Three {{engineering}} polymers (HDPE, UHMWPE, and Nylatron GS) {{have been}} studied at very high tensile strain rates (above 104 /s) using an expanding ring technique, which involves placing a thin ring of polymer as a <b>sliding</b> <b>fit</b> around a hollow thick-walled cylinder. A blast wave generated by an exploding wire results in a pressure pulse acting on the internal wall of the cylinder. This pulse propagates through the cylinder wall and is partially transferred into the ring. The ring moves virtually instantaneously at a high velocity away from the cylinder and then decelerates under almost uniaxial tension {{as a result of}} the hoop stress. Measurements were made by photographing the ring using a high speed camera at 105 to 106 frames/s, from which the true stress-strain properties were determined.

40|$|Polygonal shafts {{are used}} for torque {{transmission}} via pulleys and gears. The purpose {{of this research is}} to compare the load carrying capacity of three (P 3 G) and four (P 4 C) lobed polygonal shafts and hub connections manufactured from the same outer diameter. The P 3 G and P 4 C shaft and hub have been compared for interference, line to line and clearance fit. The conformal contact between the shaft and the hub in polygonal profile makes it difficult to design them analytically. With the advancement of numerical analysis as Finite Element Analysis, these issues can be addressed, making polygonal shafts a viable competitor to keyed and splined shafts. The loading strength of the polygonal shaft and hub connection has been analyzed using Finite element Analysis software, ANSYS®, by subjecting the connection to torsional bending load from a spur gear of 20 ° pressure angle. From the analysis, {{it was found that the}} hub experienced greater stress than the shaft in all cases. The stresses were higher in P 4 C shaft than P 3 G shaft. The clearance fit was found to be the most detrimental fit and interference fit to be the most suitable for larger power transmission. Owing to its small normal axial stress and hub displacement, the P 4 C clearance fit has its use in low power transmission where <b>sliding</b> <b>fit</b> is a requirement. For general purpose, P 3 G interference fit is recommended...|$|E

40|$|We have {{constructed}} a color-magnitude {{diagram of the}} Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal to m/sub V/ = 24. 8 mag from charged-coupled device (CCD) observations with the Kitt Peak 4 m telescope. The main-sequence turnoff is easily visible. Fits to evolutionary isochrones and the globular M 92 indicate that Ursa Minor has an age and metal abundance {{very similar to that}} of the latter cluster. No evidence for stars younger than about 16 billion years is seen, with the possible exception of approximately 20 stars believed to be blue stragglers. Ursa Minor is therefore an extreme-age galaxy, unlike superficially similar objects such as the Carina dwarf. Indeed, Ursa Minor may be the only outer-halo spheroidal whose stellar content lives up to the classical ideals of a Population II system. A distance modulus of (m-M) 0 = 19. 0 mag is derived from a <b>sliding</b> <b>fit</b> to the M 92 ridge lines. However, this modulus is uncertain by approx. 0. 1 mag, for the horizontal branch in our color-magnitude diagram is poorly populated. The ratio of blue stragglers to anomalous Cepheids in Ursa Minor is estimated to be approx. 100, a number that may provide an important constraint on binary models for the origin of these stars. A surprising result of our study is the discovery of clumpiness in the distribution of stars. This finding may give more weight to the idea that dwarf spheroidal galaxies were previously dwarf irregular galaxies, although clearly, if so, Ursa Minor must have lost its gaseous content very soon after formation.

40|$|Polygonal shafts {{are a major}} {{competitor}} {{to spline}} and keyed shafts for power transmission due to features as self-centering, lack of stress concentration area, and ease of assembly and disassembly. Past studies on polygonal profiles have focused on a single profile and comparisons based on nominal sizes of three and four lobe profiles. This research explores the loading strength of the standardized three and four lobe polygonal shafts and hubs manufactured from the same stock size, subjected to pure torsional and torsional bending load from a spur gear of 20 ° pressure angle at various fits. In absence of analytical solution, Finite element method has been used after verifying the results experimentally, theoretically, and DIN standard. From the finite element analysis, the hub was found to experience greater stress than the shaft in all cases. The clearance fit {{was found to be}} the most critical connection and interference fit to be the most suitable for larger power transmission. The P 4 C connection had greater stress, especially in the hub, than the P 3 G connection. The difference between the P 4 C shaft and the P 3 G shaft was 4. 05 % in the interference fit and 60. 6 % in the clearance fit, suggesting P 4 C clearance fit to be less favorable for larger power transmission. Owing to its small normal axial stress, the P 4 C clearance fit has its use in low power transmission where <b>sliding</b> <b>fit</b> is a requirement. The reason for greater stress in P 4 C shaft and hub connection is due to the large pressure angle at the point of contact, which leads to a smaller contact area and greater contact pressure. The contact pressure was found to be triangular shaped in clearance and transition fit and with a large crest, followed by a trough and a small crest in interference fit for torsional bending load...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Polymers are increasingly used in structures that have to withstand impact conditions. This thesis describes an investigation of strain rate properties at room temperature of four engineering polymers; polyethylene (high density, HDPE and ultra high molecular weight, UHMWPE), nylatron and polyetheretherketone (PEEK 150 g). A split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system was used to study the response of these polymers in compression tests at high strain rates up to 10 ' S- 1. Stress equilibrium in SHPB samples was studied theoretically by examining multiple reflection effects during the initial elastic loading of the polymers; this study proved very useful {{in the analysis of}} SHPB tests. To cover a wide range of strain rate, compression studies were also made at low strain rates (10 - 3 _ 10 - 2 S- 1) using a Hounsfield screw machine. Viscoelastic models have been applied to these results. These models fit quite well with the experimental results of HDPE, UHMWPE, and nylatron, but not to the PEEK due to the yield drop in the stress - strain curves, especially at high strain rates. An exploding wire technique was used as an axial impulsive loading system for hollow cylindrical samples. An image converter camera at framing intervals of 21 ls or 10 Ils recorded the radial expansion of the cylinder. The expanding cylinder was used as a driving system for a new technique called the freely expanding ring method, which was used to obtain the stress - strain behaviour of polymeric thin rings placed as a <b>sliding</b> <b>fit</b> on the cylinder. This method produced very high tensile strain rates up to fracture (> 10 ' S- 1). Comparisons have been made between results obtained from the quasi-static, SHPB, and expanding ring tests. The freely expanding ring and SHPB results were in good agreement indicating similar tensile and compressive high strain rate behaviour. The mechanical properties of the above polymers are strongly dependent on strain rate. The Young's modulus and the flow stress increase with increasing strain rate. Nylatron showed high strain rate strain softening at high strain, this was due to the high temperature rise during loading, when the transition temperature (Tg) of the material (50 QC) was exceeded. However, the other materials showed continuous hardening behaviour. Plots of the flow stress at 5...|$|E
