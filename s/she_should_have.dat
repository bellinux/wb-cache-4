5|$|Kuznetsova {{qualified}} to the 2016 Summer Olympics in singles and doubles. In doubles <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> partner with Gasparyan, {{but the young}} tennis player cited her injury; she was replaced by Daria Kasatkina. Kuznetsova reached the 3rd round in singles and the quarterfinal in doubles. She again reached the quarterfinal in a Premier 5 tournament, doing so in Cincinnati. At the US Open, Kuznetsova suffered a disappointing loss against resurgent Caroline Wozniacki despite leading 4-0 in the first set.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the evening}} on October 23, {{a series of}} phone calls between Green and Farrar {{escalated}} into a confrontation. Farrar was convinced that Green was continuing to drink heavily while <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been caring for the children, and he told Green that he knew she had poisoned him and that Social Services might be called to protect the children if she failed to get her life in order. After the last call between Green and Farrar, Farrar watched television alone in his apartment until about 12:30, when a neighbor's phone call alerted him to the fire.|$|E
5|$|As {{the family}} eats breakfast the next morning, Lois reveals her {{intention}} {{to become a}} surrogate mother for Naomi and Dale, causing Peter to become upset {{at the thought of}} her being pregnant for nine months. Despite this, Lois decides to go to Dr. Hartman to have the in vitro fertilization performed, enduring more of Dr. Hartman's shtick involving celebrity crossbreeds and having a tribe of bush men implant the egg with blowguns. A pregnancy test comes back positive the next day, and a furious Peter attempts to cause Lois to have a miscarriage before ultimately confronting her about the pregnancy. While she continues asserting her intention to provide a child to Naomi and Dale, Quahog 5 News suddenly reveals that Naomi and Dale died in a car crash on Interstate 95. Devastated by the announcement, Lois questions whether <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> an abortion or continue with the pregnancy and put the baby up for adoption.|$|E

5|$|The Queen had {{to mediate}} between her {{brothers}} in 1555, when Charles decided to abdicate as emperor {{and leave the}} government of the Netherlands to his son Philip, despite Ferdinand's objections. When Mary learned of Charles's decision, she informed him that she too would resign. Both Charles and Philip urged her to remain in the post, but she refused. She chronicled the difficulties she had faced due to her gender, the fact that she could not act as she thought <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> because of disagreements with Charles, and her age. Furthermore, she did not wish to accommodate to the ways of her nephew after years of getting used to Charles's demands. The actual reason for Mary's resignation was her numerous disagreements with her nephew. She asked for Charles's permission to leave the Netherlands upon her resignation, fearing that she would be drawn into politics again if she remained.|$|E
5|$|Walton's last {{work of the}} 1940s was {{his music}} for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On {{the advice of the}} BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's {{relations}} with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} judge certifies {{his or her}} decision, {{which is}} final, to the Prime Minister. The judge must also report to the Prime Minister whether any corrupt or illegal practice was established to have been committed by or with the knowledge and consent of any candidate or his or her agent. If a judge intends to report {{a person who was}} neither a party to the proceedings nor a candidate claiming he or <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been declared elected, that person must be given an opportunity to be heard and to give and call evidence to show why a report should not be made against him. However, where a candidate's agents are found to have been guilty of treating, undue influence or an illegal practice, but the candidate proves that the offences were committed contrary to his or her orders and without his or her sanction or connivance, or that of his or her election agents, that all reasonable means were taken to prevent corrupt and illegal practices at the election, that the offences were of a trivial and limited nature, and in other respects the election was free from corrupt or illegal practice, the election is not void.|$|E

25|$|In January 2007, {{outgoing}} Chief Justice Y.K.

25|$|The events {{created a}} great sensation, and {{became known as}} Bloody Sunday. Besant was widely blamed – or {{credited}} – for it. She threw herself into organising legal aid for the jailed workers and support for their families.

25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{investigation}} found that, while {{the bus driver}} was not aware that {{a portion of the}} bus was on the tracks as <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been, the timing of signals was so insufficient that, even if she had identified the hazard as the train approached, she would have had to proceed against a red traffic signal into the highway intersection to have moved out of the train's path.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrary}} to her fearful demeanor, Bella, according to Edward in Midnight Sun, has {{no sense of}} fear when she finds out Edward is a vampire. Instead of running away, as <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have,</b> she decides to ask lots of questions with extreme curiosity. This makes Edward {{believe that it is}} not bad luck that follows her around, but that she has no sense of self-preservation. Bella isn't very rational nor sensible as she lacks common sense and street intelligence.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} her life, Machali lost {{almost all}} of her teeth, sight in one eye, and much of her {{strength}} due to aging. She also lost her territory, as her daughter Sundari from her last litter drove her out of her turf. As she was unable to hunt and kill for herself, park staff provided her with food. This intervention became somewhat controversial; tiger expert K Ullas Karanth commented that it resulted in Machali living longer than <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>have,</b> and that truly wild animals should be born, live and die naturally.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, Essie Mae Washington-Williams {{revealed}} she was {{the daughter}} of Wilson's former employer, the late Senator Strom Thurmond, and Thurmond's black maid. Wilson was among those who publicly doubted her assertion that Thurmond had a child out of wedlock. Wilson said even if her story was true, <b>she</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> revealed it because [...] "it's a smear" [...] on Thurmond's image and was a way to [...] "diminish" [...] Thurmond's legacy. After Thurmond's family acknowledged the truth of Washington-Williams' revelation, Wilson apologized, but said that he still thought that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> revealed that Thurmond was her father.|$|R
60|$|Here Mrs. Proudie made a false step. <b>She</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> {{alluded to}} the {{possibility}} of retreat on her part. <b>She</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> expressed the idea that her order for Mr. Slope's expulsion could be treated otherwise than by immediate obedience. In answer to such a question the bishop naturally said in his own mind that, as it was necessary that one should leave the room, perhaps it might be as well that Mrs. Proudie did so. He did say so in his own mind, but externally he again scratched his head and again twiddled his thumbs.|$|R
