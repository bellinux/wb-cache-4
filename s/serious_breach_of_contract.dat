Mr Wilson, the gardener, told Mr Racher [...] "get stuffed, go and shit yourself". The Court of Appeal held that the employer's attitude meant this breakdown in trust and confidence was the employer's own doing, and because the law no longer saw employment as a [...] "Czar-serf" [...] relationship, Mr Wilson was in the right and was wrongfully dismissed. The remedy for breach of contract, following a long tradition that specific performance should not result in draconian consequences or binding hostile parties to continue working together, is typically monetary compensation to put the claimant in the same position as if the contract had been properly performed. However, in Edwards v Chesterfield Royal Hospital, the Supreme Court held that an injunction is available to restrain breach of contract for the employer's failure to follow a doctor's contractual disciplinary procedure. This indicated that specific performance should always in principle be available, particularly in large organisations where people can be shifted to avoid personality conflicts.|$|E

50|$|A {{wrongful}} dismissal can be {{actual or}} constructive, but a constructive dismissal {{is almost certain}} to be a wrongful one, since the correct notice will not have been given if the dismissal was caused by a resignation, itself caused by the employer's <b>serious</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> An employee who was constructively dismissed, as well as possibly having a claim for breach of the duty not to destroy the bond of mutual trust, will usually have a claim for wrongful dismissal. As only economic loss can be claimed for breach of contract, the main loss will be earnings due to the lost notice period, as opposed to any disgruntlement about the manner or reason for dismissal, so the constructive nature of the dismissal tends to disappear into the claim for lost notice period.|$|E

40|$|In the {{literature}} on the uniform UN sales law (CISG), the decisions in the first and second instances of the Zapata 1 case triggered an extraordinarily lively discussion. Simply stated, the case concerned the delivery of painted cookie tins used for packaging Christmas cookies, for which the American buyer (i. e., place of business in the USA), citing flimsy pretexts, refused to pay. The Mexican seller (i. e., place of business in Mexico), sued and was awarded compensatory damages; as part of the damages, the trial court also awarded the plaintiff its attorneys’ fees. At the appellate level, where only the issue of attorneys’ fees was disputed, the appellate court rejected the claim for reimbursement of attorneys’ fees and reversed the trial court decision. [The seller’s] appeal to the U. S. Supreme Court by writ of certiorari was denied. The cases concerned the so-called “American rule,” according to which the parties each bear their own litigation expenses, and in particular their own attorneys’ fees, independent of the outcome of the case. This deviates from German legal understanding and has significant practical consequences. In particular, high attorneys’ fees could lead to the result that the compensatory damages awarded to the plaintiff in actuality fall far short of covering his losses, and for the victorious defendant winning a case can be a pyrrhic victory. Yet, the American rule is not without exceptions, and especially for abusive lawsuits brought on obviously groundless claims, American procedural law permits the losing party bringing such claims to be partially burdened with the cost. Also in cases of especially <b>serious</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> an award of punitive damages could make it possible for the victorious plaintiff to recover his litigation expenses and attorneys’ fees. Nevertheless, in the large majority of cases the American rule leads to the described results, which for German jurists appear at first glance surprising and unacceptable. Especially for foreign parties to a contract who come before an American court and win, the American rule can lead to unpleasant surprises...|$|E

2500|$|One it is {{established}} which terms {{are incorporated into}} an agreement, their meaning must be determined. Since the introduction of legislation regulating unfair terms, English courts have become firmer in their general guiding principle that agreements are construed {{to give effect to}} the intentions of the parties from the standpoint of a reasonable person. This changed significantly from the early 20th century, when English courts had become enamoured with a literalist theory of interpretation, championed in part by Lord Halsbury. As greater concern grew around the mid-20th century over unfair terms, and particularly exclusion clauses, the courts swung to the opposite position, utilising heavily the doctrine of contra proferentum. Ambiguities in clauses excluding or limiting one party's liability would be construed against the person relying on it. In the leading case, Canada Steamship Lines Ltd v R the Crown's shed in Montreal harbour burnt down, destroying goods owned by Canada Steamship lines. Lord Morton held that a clause in the contract limiting the Crown's excluding liability for [...] "damage... to... goods... being... in the said shed" [...] was not enough to excuse it from liability for negligence because the clause could also be construed as referring to strict liability under another contract clause. It would exclude that instead. Some judges, and in particular Lord Denning wished to go further by introducing a rule <b>of</b> [...] "fundamental <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract" [...] whereby no liability for very <b>serious</b> <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> could be excluded at all. While the rules remain ready for application where statute may not help, such hostile approaches to interpretation were generally felt to run contrary to the plain meaning of language.|$|R

On 16 October 2007, Cousins was arrested in Northbridge, Perth, after police had pulled his vehicle over [...] "due to the manner of his driving". Police searched his car and found {{quantities}} of prohibited drugs. Cousins was then sacked by West Coast after <b>serious</b> <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> his <b>contract</b> with them. In 2009, Cousins joined Richmond to continue his AFL career, but on 12 April Cousins and three other Richmond players were suspended by the club after a drunken altercation in a Sydney hotel. Although Cousins was not intoxicated it was ruled {{that he had not}} acted responsibly leading to his suspension for 1 week. A few months later in July, Cousins was admitted to hospital after a severe reaction to the prescribed sleeping pills he had taken. This incident lead to the debate of whether legal stimulants (such as caffeine) and legal sedatives (such as sleeping pills) could be used by athletes. The Premier of Victoria, John Brumby, disapproved of their use within sporting events.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (LLM (Labour Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. To {{what extent}} should an {{employee}} {{be entitled to}} a disciplinary hearing in case of automatic {{termination of a contract}} due to absenteeism in the workplace? Here {{the focus is on the}} relationship between automatic dismissal and procedural fairness in the absence of the workplace. Section 185 (1) (a) of the LRA states that no employee may be unfairly dismissed. This means that each worker may only be dismissed in a fair manner that would imply that all prescribed substantive and procedural rules are followed. Section 188 (2) of the LRA provides that the employer must follow fair procedure before dismissal occurs. Procedural fairness requires that an employee is entitled to a disciplinary hearing, where the employee has the opportunity to state his or her side of the case. Therefore a disciplinary hearing is part of the procedural fairness process in labour law. The automatic termination of an employment contract without notice may be justified if a <b>serious</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> occurred. In terms of procedural fairness the employee must get the opportunity to state his or her case in a disciplinary hearing according to section 188 (2) of the LRA. In circumstances where an employee's employment contract provides that his or her employment contract would automatically terminate after a number of days of absence (without reason) will not correlate with section 188, which clearly stipulates that fair procedure must be followed. Procedural fairness implies that dismissal must be preceded by a disciplinary hearing at which the employee should be able to state his or her side of the case. This situation is however complicated by circumstances where an employee is seriously ill, hospitalized, in a coma, arrested or public transport to work was declined. In these cases the employee cannot be held responsible for his or her absence. The fact is that the employee should get the opportunity to state his or her side of the case in a disciplinary hearing. The purpose of this research report is to indicate that an employee is entitled to a disciplinary hearing in cases of automatic termination of a contract due to absenteeism in the workplace. The study will be characterized by a literature review of the relevant South African legislation, case law, textbooks, journal articles and electronic materials...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe thesis {{discusses}} {{the origin and}} development <b>of</b> anticipatory <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> in South African law {{leading up to the}} decision in Datacolor International (Pty) Ltd v Intamarket (Pty) Ltd 2001 (2) SA 284 (SCA) and the implications of this decision on the law. This decision is generally regarded as the culmination of the development of a 'new approach' to repudiation, as a form <b>of</b> anticipatory <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> in South African law and this 'new approach' and other aspects of the decision will be discussed in detail. Drawing on Datacolor International (Pty) Ltd v Intamarket (Pty) Ltd and the decisions of Lord Diplock in English law the thesis proposes a model for anticipatory <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> that defines anticipatory <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> as conduct or circumstances that support a conclusion, with reasonable certainty, that a contracting party will fail to perform their primary obligations under the contract correctly and that such failure justifies affording the aggrieved party a right to cancel the <b>contract.</b> Anticipatory <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> will therefore always amount to a material <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> where material <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> consists <b>of</b> a failure by a contracting party to perform her or his primary obligations correctly, or conduct which indicates with reasonable certainty that she or he will fail to perform their primary obligations correctly, which will substantially deprive the aggrieved party of the benefit <b>of</b> the <b>contract.</b> If, balancing the interests of the parties, it would be fair to afford the aggrieved party a right to cancel the contract this conduct will amount to a material <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> Anticipatory <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> are those material <b>breaches</b> which consist <b>of</b> conduct indicating that a failure will occur rather than consisting of the actual failure to perform a primary obligation. In addition to defining when the remedy of cancellation is available to an aggrieved party the thesis also proposes certain other modifications to the remedies available to an aggrieved party facing an anticipatory <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> including introducing into the South African law, as a remedy for an anticipated <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> a 'request for an adequate assurance of performance' modelled on the remedy of the same name originating in the Uniform Commercial Code...|$|R
