The {{aim of this study}} was to explore whether participation in organized sport may be associated to higher levels of physical activity in adolescents with functional limitations, based on a national representative sample. Data from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study collected in Finland from two data collection rounds (2002 and 2010) were conducted and pooled from adolescents aged between 13 and 15 years old with functional limitations (n = 1041). Differences in self-reported physical activity over the past week and participation in organized sport activity were analysed for each function. Overall, four in ten (n = 413) participated in organized sport and were significantly (p < 0. 001) more physically active (mean = 4. 92 days, SD = 1. 81) than their non-participating (mean = 3. 29, SD = 1. 86) peers with functional limitations. Despite low population prevalence, adolescents with epilepsy or visual impairments were the least active if they were not participating in organized sport, yet were the most active if they were involved in organized sport. Participating in organized sport appears to be an important factor promoting resources for maintaining recommended levels of physical activity in Finnish adolescents with functional limitations...|$|E
40|$|Objectives The lie-telling {{abilities}} {{of children with}} fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) (aged 4 – 8 years) were tested using a temptation resistance paradigm. Methods Children were told not to peek at a forbidden toy while left alone in a room. Later children {{were asked if they}} peeked at the toy as well as follow-up questions {{to see if they could}} conceal their peeking behavior and maintain their lie in subsequent verbal statements. Results Approximately 78 % of the children peeked at the toy. However, 94 % of the FASD children lied about peeking, a rate that is much higher than the non-FASD control group (72 %). As age increased, FASD children were better at concealing their lies and maintaining semantic leakage control than non-FASD children.

40|$|A {{grounded}} theory methodology {{is used to}} investigate people with psychotic experiences' constructions of their mental health problems. In-depth interviews were conducted on a sample of 9 {{people who had been}} given a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The focus of these interviews was on participants' understanding of the difficulties which had brought them into contact with psychiatric services, and their beliefs about mental illness and schizophrenia in general. The methodological approach taken in this research contrasts with the traditional research in this area (on insight) which assumed that deviations from the expert view of a psychosis were either deficiencies or distortions of knowledge and were in fact a symptom of an underlying pathology. Furthermore, this research challenges the notion that the discourse of people experiencing psychosis is meaningless and unintelligible, and that it should be ignored, discouraged or modified. This research suggests that people with psychosis may develop narratives to account for their subjective experiences of psychotic phenomena in the context of meanings which are available in their culture and in the context of relationships with important others both past and present. The survival narratives evident in this research embodied the struggle that people with psychosis have in maintaining a positive identity, when the core areas of that identity are challenged both by their actual mental health problems as well as the stereotypes and prejudices of mental illness and schizophrenia found in society and in the psychiatric system. Professionals working with people with psychosis must be alert to the negative impact that these social constructions potentially have on people's self-concept and identities, and begin to address this <b>secondary</b> <b>disability</b> both in their individual work and on a systemic level...|$|E

This mixed-method study investigated variables that influenced rehabilitation outcome of former clients of Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) who are deaf. Quantitative data was collected from the Federal Case Services Record (CSR) 911 on 411 former clients who are deaf and whose case files were closed between the years of 1990 and 1995. The quantitative aspect of this design used descriptive statistics, frequency distributions, chi-square test of the independence of categorical variables, and Fisher's exact test to examine and explore variables related to client demographics (i. e., disability, <b>secondary</b> <b>disability,</b> gender, race, marital status, income at referral, age), VR services received (i. e., diagnostic, physical restoration, training, counseling and guidance, job referral, placement, transportation, maintenance, and all other services), and closure information (i. e., status 26 or status 28). Significant associations were found between case file closure status and age, marital status, race, and work status at application. These findings were supported by qualitative data. Qualitative data was collected on 10 of the original 411 former clients who are deaf through personal interviews using the preferred language of the clients. Qualitative data provided information on the perceptions of former clients' who are deaf about the services received through VR, the outcome of the services received, and consequent impact of services on their quality of life. Overarching themes associated with post-secondary education, communication, personal support, job placement, self-determination, and independence were prevalent in the interviews with participants. The findings from quantitative and qualitative data suggest that VR outcome and clients' perceptions of outcome were an accurate measure of employment success or lack of success in the VR system. All participants associated personal success with a positive quality of life. Ability to achieve a positive quality of life, however, differed with the education and functioning level of clients. Clients who had post-secondary education, family support, communication skills, and independent living skills assumed responsibility for their successes or failures, whereas clients without these variables attributed responsibility for success or failure to VR services. Overall, a positive quality of life was easier to achieve for clients who are deaf and educated. Further research is needed to address the vocational and personal needs of clients who are deaf and whose functioning level is negatively influenced by lack of post-secondary education, family support, communication skills, and independent living skills...|$|E

40|$|Report {{attempts}} to understand midwives’ {{perceptions of their}} practice in addressing alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Background Alcohol is a teratogenic substance and, when consumed during pregnancy, {{is associated with a}} range of adverse effects in the developing fetus, including spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, low birthweight, growth deficiency, intra-uterine growth restriction, and prematurity. The umbrella term FASD describes disabilities that include fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (PFAS) and neurodevelopmental disorder-alcohol exposed (ND-AE). The prevalence of FASD has been reported as 2 - 5 % in the USA and in Canada it is estimated as 1 / 100 births. FASDs are under-diagnosed and under-reported in Australia where the prevalence is reported as 1. 7 / 1, 000 live births and 4. 7 / 1, 000 Indigenous live births. Children with FASDs may experience developmental delay, deficits in intellectual functioning and difficulties with learning, memory and attention; may have poor executive functioning and deficits in social and adaptive functioning. Prenatal alcohol exposure may also result in <b>secondary</b> <b>disabilities,</b> for example, limited opportunities for work and mental health problems such as depression and self-injury. Very few adults with FAS work and live independently, many have mental health problems, trouble with the law, inappropriate sexual behaviours, drug and alcohol problems, and experience incarceration. These <b>secondary</b> <b>disabilities</b> may be prevented by early diagnosis and management of FASD. The degree of harm to the fetus from prenatal alcohol exposure is influenced by the dose, pattern, and timing of alcohol exposure and the stage of development of the fetus when exposed. Research evidence is inconclusive about the effects of low levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and its risk of harm to the fetus has not been determined. Thus the Australian Guidelines to Reduce Health Risks from Drinking Alcohol Guideline 4 (Australian Alcohol Guideline) aims to prevent alcohol consumption during pregnancy and applies an evidence based precautionary principle: “For women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, not drinking is the safest option”. It is important to prevent exposure of the fetus to alcohol - there is no cure for FASDs and their burden and cost to individuals, families, communities and society is great...|$|R
