2500|$|Nanoconcrete {{is created}} by high-energy mixing (HEM) of cement, sand and water. To ensure the mixing is {{thorough}} enough to create nano-concrete, the mixer must apply a total mixing power to the mixture of 30 - 600 watts per kilogram of the mix. [...] This mixing must continue long enough to yield a net specific energy expended upon the mix of at least 5000 joules per kilogram of the mix. A plasticizer or a <b>superplasticizer</b> is then added to the activated mixture which can later be mixed with aggregates in a conventional concrete mixer. In the HEM process, the intense mixing of cement and water with sand provides dissipation of energy and increases shear stresses {{on the surface of}} cement particles. This intense mixing serves to divide the cement particles into extremely fine nanometer scale sizes, which provides for extremely thorough mixing. [...] This results in the increased volume of water interacting with cement and acceleration of Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) colloid creation.|$|E
2500|$|Workability is {{the ability}} of a fresh (plastic) {{concrete}} mix to fill the form/mold properly with the desired work (vibration) and without reducing the concrete's quality. Workability depends on water content, aggregate (shape and size distribution), cementitious content and age (level of hydration) and can be modified by adding chemical admixtures, like <b>superplasticizer.</b> Raising the water content or adding chemical admixtures increases concrete workability. Excessive water leads to increased bleeding or segregation of aggregates (when the cement and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting concrete having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate blend with an undesirable gradation can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low slump, which cannot readily be made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water. An undesirable gradation can mean using a large aggregate that is too large for the size of the formwork, or which has too few smaller aggregate grades to serve to fill the gaps between the larger grades, or using too little or too much sand for the same reason, or using too little water, or too much cement, or even using jagged crushed stone instead of smoother round aggregate such as pebbles. [...] Any combination of these factors and others may result in a mix which is too harsh, i.e., which does not flow or spread out smoothly, is difficult to get into the formwork, and which is difficult to surface finish.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{efficiency}} of polycarboxylic <b>superplasticizers</b> (derivatives of acrylic (SP-A and SP-B) or maleic (SP-C and SP-D) acids) after esterification with polyoxyethylene glycols (PEG) in cement pastes was analysed. The chemical {{structure of the}} <b>superplasticizers</b> was defined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). According to the experimental results the <b>superplasticizers</b> - derivatives of maleic acid – display greater molar mass and are built from backbone polymaleic chains and very long side polyoxyethylene chains. It is shown that acrylic <b>superplasticizers</b> display lower molar mass and are built from polyacrylic backbone chains and a higher number of shorter polyoxyethylene side chains. The efficiency o <b>superplasticizers</b> has been measured through their hydrophilicity, defined as the absorbance ratio of the ether band AET 1110 (STRCH 2 –O–CH 2 ET) (referred to as the hydrophilic oxyethylene groups) to the ester band AES 1730 - 40 (STRC=OES) (referred to as the hydrophobic ester groups O=C–O–C) (with constant contents of aliphatic groups). A higher hydrophilicity of maleic <b>superplasticizers,</b> in comparison to acrylic, results from greater participation by the hydrophilic than the hydrophobic groups.

The development of new <b>superplasticizers</b> during the last decades has determined the most important progress in the field of concrete structures in terms of higher strength, longer durability, lower shrinkage and safer placement particularly in elements with very congesteded reinforcement. The progress from sulphonated polymer to polycarboxylate has resulted in higher water reduction at a given workability and lower slump loss.

40|$|Placing of {{concrete}} requires much more water than the cement needs for its hydration. This {{results in a}} certain porosity in the hardened concrete, which facilitates chemical degradation of this material. By adding small amounts of polymeric admixtures, called <b>superplasticizers,</b> one can greatly decrease {{the amount of water}} required to obtain the desired workability and consequently the porosity, which improves durability. Although these <b>superplasticizers</b> are widely used today, the mechanisms through which they act in concrete remain poorly understood. It nevertheless recognised that the origin of the effect, which <b>superplasticizers</b> have in concrete, comes from decreasing the attractive forces between cement particles. The effective volume of agglomerates and thereby the effective volume of solids in the suspension is decreased, which improves workability. Controling and modifying interparticle forces has been for many years, and remains today, a topic of intense research in the field of colloids. Also, is it not surprising that many authors have attempted to apply this knowledge to explain the effect that <b>superplasticizers</b> have in concrete. They have thereby been able to identify different types of behaviour depending on the chemical nature of <b>superplasticizers.</b> However, applying such concepts developed for colloids, to cement suspensions in which particle sizes are much larger presents many limitations. The main objective of this thesis has been to integrate these limitations, as rigorously as possible, while applying interparticle force concepts to cement suspensions. In order to reach this objective, further development of current theoretical approaches had to be carried out. In particular, it was necessary to integrate the non-ideality of the thermodynamics of the aqueous phase of the cement suspension. These effects were integrated into the calculation of electrostatic and dispersion forces. In addition, we have taken into account the very large particle size distribution of cement, by determining the frequency of contacts between particles of different sizes. This allowed us to develop a quantitative relation between calculated interparticle forces and measured yield stress of cement suspension. Although this approach still presents limitations, it is the first approach, at least for cement, which gives more than a qualitative link between rheology and interparticle forces. These calculations could only be developed after experimental data had allowed attribution of the dispersing effect of <b>superplasticizers</b> exclusively to the adsorbed polymers. For this, we had to use, in addition to cement, inert model systems (Mg(OH) 2 and MgO) in order not to superimpose to desagglomeration, the effect of modifying the on-going chemical reactions. The interest of these model systems over others is that they have a high isoelectric point (around pH 12) like cement. It is therefore possible to have both surface charge and pH similar to cement. This is important for adsorption and polymer conformation to be representative of cement suspensions. We argue that the major effect of chemistry of cement suspensions is the coprecipitation or intercallation of the polymers during the formation of ettringite. This reaction reaches its maximum speed barely a few minutes after water is contacted with cement. It is why one observes much larger polymer consumption, when it is included in the mixing water. This has been often cited in literature, but was never developed in a satisfying way with respect to dispersion efficiency. The calculation of interparticle forces, in a framework adapted to cement, as well as the identification of the reactions consuming <b>superplasticizers,</b> open new paths for the development of <b>superplasticizers,</b> which will offer higher performances for lower dosage. This should make the immediate cost of durable concrete more affordable, which is probably the best incentive to reduce the energy cost of the life service maintenance {{of concrete}} infrastructures...|$|R

The widespread use of hydrated lime and pozzolan-hydrated lime pastes for paints, consolidant products, soil treatments and the obtaining of repair mortars and grouts, especially for architectural monuments of the Cultural Heritage, supports the interest of these materials.
