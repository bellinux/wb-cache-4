The choreography was done by Alex Magno, who also collaborated on the Drowned World Tour. The tour designers DSquared² and Arianne Phillips also designed Madonna's cowgirl costume. The video features Madonna walking down an automated treadmill walkway {{in front of a}} projection screen, while cowboys dance and play on the sand in the video played on the screen behind her. Later, they join Madonna in front of the screen in a choreographed dance routine. The iconic final scene of the video depicts a cowboy riding a <b>Skewbald</b> <b>horse</b> in slow motion getting thrown to the ground, and getting up again.|$|E

500|$|The Marwari averages between [...] high. Horses {{originating}} {{in different parts}} of India tend to be of different heights, with the breed having an outside range of [...] high. They can be bay, grey, chestnut, palomino, piebald, or <b>skewbald.</b> Although white <b>horses</b> are bred specifically for religious use in India, they are generally not accepted into Marwari stud books. Gray horses are considered auspicious, and tend to be the most valuable, with piebald and <b>skewbald</b> <b>horses</b> the second-most favoured. Black horses are considered unlucky, as the colour is a symbol of death and darkness. Horses that have the white markings of a blaze and four white socks are considered lucky.|$|R
50|$|The tomb is {{a typical}} t-shaped nobles' tomb, with a long {{transverse}} hall. In the right-hand hall there are typical scenes showing Menna and his wife receiving (or giving) offerings. At {{the end of this}} hall there is a stele, showing two men and two women praying. The back wall of this hall shows the funerary feast. The end of the left-hand hall shows Menna and his wife offering to Osiris. The walls of this hall depicts offerings to Menna and then the fields of his heavenly estate, together with the tomb owner on a Chariot, being drawn by a <b>skewbald</b> <b>horse.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{horse was}} foaled in 1741 and {{originally}} owned by Francis, 2nd Earl of Godolphin, and later sold. His {{name has been}} recorded as [...] "Squball", [...] "Sku-ball", or [...] "Stewball". He won many races in England and was sent to Ireland. The Irish turf calendar states that he won six races worth £508 in 1752, when he was eleven years old, and was the top-earning runner of that year in Ireland. His most famous race {{took place on the}} plains of Kildare, Ireland, which is generally the subject of the song of the same name. The early ballad about the event has Skewball belonging to an Arthur Marvell or Mervin. Based on the horse's name, Skewball was likely a <b>skewbald</b> <b>horse.</b>|$|E
50|$|Skewbald is a {{colour pattern}} of horses. A <b>skewbald</b> <b>horse</b> has a coat {{made up of}} white patches on a non-black base coat, such as chestnut, bay, or any colour besides black coat. Skewbald horses which are bay and white (bay is a reddish-brown colour with black mane and tail) are {{sometimes}} called tricoloured. These horses usually have pink skin under white markings and dark skin under non-white areas. Other than colour, it is similar in appearance to the piebald pattern. Some animals also exhibit colouration of the irises of the eye that match the surrounding skin (blue eyes for white skin, brown for dark). The underlying genetic cause is related to a condition known as leucism. The term {{is also used to}} describe spotting patterns in various other animals, such as goats.|$|E
60|$|On {{turning a}} corner {{out of a}} narrow coppice-bordered lane into a wider road that sloped {{steadily}} upward in {{a long stretch of}} hill Elaine saw, coming toward her at no great distance, a string of yellow-painted vans, drawn for the most part by <b>skewbald</b> or speckled <b>horses.</b> A certain rakish air about these oncoming road- craft proclaimed them as belonging to a travelling wild-beast show, decked out in the rich primitive colouring that one's taste in childhood would have insisted on before it had been schooled in the artistic value of dulness. It was an unlooked-for and distinctly unwelcome encounter. The mare had already commenced a sixfold scrutiny with nostrils, eyes and daintily-pricked ears; one ear made hurried little backward movements to hear what Elaine was saying about the eminent niceness and respectability of the approaching caravan, but even Elaine felt that she would be unable satisfactorily to explain the elephants and camels that would certainly form part of the procession. To turn back would seem rather craven, and the mare might take fright at the manoeuvre and try to bolt; a gate standing ajar at the entrance to a farmyard lane provided a convenient way out of the difficulty.|$|R

5000|$|Genetically, a <b>skewbald</b> <b>horse</b> begins most {{commonly}} with a chestnut base coat colour (called [...] "red" [...] by geneticists), {{or some other}} set of colour genes other than black. Then the horse has an allele for one of three basic spotting patterns overlaying the base colour. The most common coloured spotting pattern is called tobiano, and is a dominant gene. Tobiano creates spots that are large and rounded, usually with a somewhat vertical orientation, with white that usually crosses {{the back of the}} horse, white on the legs, with the head mostly dark. Three less common spotting genes are the frame and splash overo genes, which create a mostly dark, jagged spotting with a horizontal orientation, white on the head, but dark or minimally marked legs. The sabino pattern can be very minimal, usually adding white that runs up the legs onto the belly or flanks, [...] "lacy" [...] or roaning {{at the edge of the}} white, plus white on the head that either extends past the eye, over the chin, or both. The genetics of overo and sabino are not yet fully understood, but they can appear in the offspring of two solid-coloured parents, whereas a tobiano must always have at least one tobiano parent.|$|E
