60|$|This {{is a true}} story. It {{happened}} in Markdale to an uncle of my mothers. He wanted to marry Miss Jemima Parr. Felicity says Jemima is not a romantic name for a heroin of a story but I cant help it {{in this case because}} it is a true story and her name realy was Jemima. My mothers uncle was named Thomas Taylor. He was poor at that time and so the father of Miss Jemima Parr did not want him for a soninlaw and told him he was not to come near the house or he would set the dog on him. Miss Jemima Parr was very pretty and my mothers uncle Thomas was just crazy about her and she wanted him too. She cried almost every night after her father forbid him to come to the house except the nights she had to sleep or she would have died. And she was so frightened he might try to come for all and get tore up by the dog and it was a bull-dog too that would never let go. But mothers uncle Thomas was too cute for that. He waited till one day there was preaching in the Markdale church {{in the middle of the}} week because it was sacrament time and Miss Jemima Parr and her family all went because her father was an elder. My mothers uncle Thomas went too and set in the pew just behind Miss Jemima Parrs family. When they all bowed their heads at prayer time Miss Jemima Parr didnt but <b>set</b> <b>bolt</b> uprite and my mothers uncle Thomas bent over and wispered in her ear. I dont know what he said so I cant right it but Miss Jemima Parr blushed that is turned red and nodded her head. Perhaps some people may think that my mothers uncle Thomas shouldent of wispered at prayer time in church but you must remember that Miss Jemima Parrs father had thretened to set the dog on him and that was hard lines when he was a respektable young man though not rich. Well when they were singing the last sam my mothers uncle Thomas got up and went out very quitely and as soon as church was out Miss Jemima Parr walked out too real quick. Her family never suspekted anything and they hung round talking to folks and shaking hands while Miss Jemima Parr and my mothers uncle Thomas were eloping outside. And what do you suppose they eloped in. Why in Miss Jemima Parrs fathers slay. And when he went out they were gone and his slay was gone also his horse. Of course my mothers uncle Thomas didnt steal the horse. He just borroed it and sent it home the next day. But before Miss Jemima Parrs father could get another rig to follow them they were so far away he couldent catch them before they got married. And they lived happy together forever afterwards. Mothers uncle Thomas lived to be a very old man. He died very suddent. He felt quite well when he went to sleep and when he woke up he was dead.|$|E

40|$|The method {{involves}} {{driving a}} <b>setting</b> <b>bolt</b> (3) through the fiber-reinforced plastic-components (1, 2) as a joint element and subsequently through a metal sheet (4) {{lying in the}} joint area (5) for fixing the overlapping fiber-reinforced plastic-components in the joint area. A firmly bonded connection is established between the <b>setting</b> <b>bolt</b> and the metal sheet by resistance welding or friction welding. A circular ring-shaped metal disk is used as the metal sheet. An independent claim is included for a device for executing the method...|$|R
50|$|Lug-style valves have {{threaded}} inserts at {{both sides}} of the valve body. This allows them to be installed into a system using two <b>sets</b> of <b>bolts</b> and no nuts. The valve is installed between two flanges using a separate <b>set</b> of <b>bolts</b> for each flange. This setup permits either side of the piping system to be disconnected without disturbing the other side.|$|R
30|$|Under the {{influence}} of extremely weak rock, ground stress and swelling pressures, the roadway deformed to a significant extent, in which floor heave was particularly serious. Steel <b>sets</b> or <b>bolts</b> alone had little effect in controlling roadway deformation. So, a variety of supporting methods, such as closed 36 U-shape steel <b>sets</b> and <b>bolting,</b> a pair of 12 I-beam steel <b>sets</b> and <b>bolting,</b> were tested in situ. Although offering significant support strength, roadways deformed continuously and those supports failed to achieve an ideal effect. Because {{of the presence of}} expansive clay in this extremely weak rock, grouting was unfeasible. So, the alternative was to improve the strength of steel sets, or to improve the strength of bolts, or to improve the strength of both. This project mainly researched the effect of bolting in this extremely weak rock, included assessment of effect of roof and both sides bolting, and the effect of floor bolting.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{modelling}} and calculations of asymmetrical multi-bolted joints at the assembly stage. The physical {{model of the}} joint {{is based on a}} system composed of four subsystems, which are: a couple of joined elements, a contact layer between the elements, and a <b>set</b> of <b>bolts.</b> The contact layer is assumed as the Winkler model, which can be treated as a nonlinear or linear model. In contrast, the <b>set</b> of <b>bolts</b> are modelled using simplified beam models, known as spider bolt models. The theorem according to which nonlinearity of the contact layer has a negligible impact on the final preload of the joint in the case of its sequential tightening has been verified. Results of sample calculations for the selected multi-bolted system, in the form of diagrams of preloads in the bolts as well as normal contact pressure between the joined elements during the assembly process and at its end, are presented...|$|R
50|$|Developed in the Philippines, {{this method}} (abbreviated HPSD) {{consists}} of a cylinder pressure cap made from a 3 mm thick mild steel plate secured with 8 <b>sets</b> of <b>bolts,</b> a 2-HP diesel engine, and a pressure regulator with 1.4-14 kg/m2 capacity. The cap is placed over the stump of a pole, tree or bamboo and the preservative is forced into the wood with pressure from the engine.|$|R

50|$|Daimler's {{development}} of the 2.5-litre saloon was initially given few resources; the first prototype {{was based on an}} old Jaguar Mark 1 unibody that had been abandoned outside one of the factory buildings after having been modified for suspension experiments. Once the concept had been proven, a new prototype based on a Mark 2 body shell was built The Daimler V8 engine was more compact and lighter than the Jaguar XK6 engine used in the Mark 2, and weighed approximately 1 long cwt kg less. Spring and damper settings were revised accordingly to suit the altered weight distribution. The engine sump had to be redesigned to fit between the Mark 2's front suspension units and around one of its crossmembers, new exhaust manifolds were designed to fit in the engine bay, the water pump and cooling fan were relocated, and different air filters were used. The cylinder head fasteners were changed from studs to <b>set</b> <b>bolts</b> to allow the heads to be removed while the engine was still in the car. The radiator fan was driven through a viscous coupling unit that slipped progressively with increased engine speed, which reduced noise from the fan. The Daimler's Borg-Warner Type 35 automatic transmission was smaller and lighter than the units used on the Mark 2 and had strong engine braking in each gear range.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, {{furniture}} makers used molten sulfur to produce decorative inlays in their craft. Because of the sulfur dioxide produced {{during the process}} of melting sulfur, the craft of sulfur inlays was soon abandoned. Molten sulfur is sometimes still used for <b>setting</b> steel <b>bolts</b> into drilled concrete holes where high shock resistance is desired for floor-mounted equipment attachment points. Pure powdered sulfur was used as a medicinal tonic and laxative. With the advent of the contact process, the majority of sulfur today is used to make sulfuric acid {{for a wide range of}} uses, particularly fertilizer.|$|R
50|$|The {{only place}} that {{actually}} sold skateboards in Liverpool {{at that time}} was a record shop. It was called Probe Records. When I went in there for the first time they had two boards on the wall, a Skull Skates “Dead Guys” and a Toxic team model. I think they had two sets of wheels and two sets of trucks. They had no griptape and one <b>set</b> of <b>bolts.</b> That was my first memory of going into a skateshop laughs. I rode my first complete with no griptape for a month or so until Probe got some grip back in stock.|$|R
5000|$|The bolt {{assembly}} also contains the spring extractor, while a lever case ejector {{is located at}} the base of the feed tray. Spent casings are ejected downward.

According to Taylor's power law and Green's index of dispersion, nematode dispersion was aggregated in both <b>sets</b> of <b>bolts.</b> The {{degree of aggregation}} {{did not differ significantly}} between beetle-infested and noninfested bolts, suggesting that the presence of M. carolinensis does not affect nematode dispersion within a bolt. Nematode population densities differed radially in bolts not infested with pine sawyers, but in a nonregular pattern. Moisture content of the bolts was correlated with population density of B. xylophilus, suggesting that nematode aggregates occur in areas of high moisture content...|$|R

He {{encountered}} Swaps while hanging over the rail at Washington Park, {{three months after the}} Derby victory. [...] "The horse I see in memory now looks tall and radiant," [...] he later observed. [...] "Swaps had a large, luminous brown eye, an exquisitely Aegean head and face that looked chiseled in cameo, and a warm, friendly breath that he held for a moment as your offered hand, cupped downward, rose and drew near him." [...] A week later, Nack saw Swaps again at Washington Park, [...] "lunging through the homestretch like a panther in the gloaming, three in front, his powerful shoulders glinting in the light as he reached his forelegs far {{in front of him and}} galloped home in hand." [...] Swaps beat Traffic Judge and set a new course record of 1:54 3/5. [...] "The clarity of that performance, the decisive finality that I had yearned for and missed in the world of horse shows ruled by fallible and sometimes idiotic judges, had won me to racing as a sport and to the memory of that horse forever." [...] Eleven days after the American Derby, Swaps lost a Washington Park match race to Nashua. Fourteen-year-old William, watching the race on a fifteen-inch Admiral television <b>set,</b> <b>bolted</b> from his house, ran to his neighbors yard, and vomited on a tree. A week later, he cut a photo of Swaps out of a magazine and stuck it in his wallet.
