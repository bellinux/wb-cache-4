5|$|Besides {{the final}} scene, other aspects were discussed: Garcia noted the acting of Richard Madden {{and how the}} Freys had been introduced. Ryan praised {{the wide range of}} {{emotions}} used by Emilia Clarke while playing Daenerys, and how Peter Dinklage played Tyrion's frustration and confusion during the episode. Both she and McNutt were glad that Tyrion's exposition scene in the tent with Bronn and Shae did not use <b>sex</b> <b>to</b> keep viewers, as was done in past episodes.|$|E
5|$|It seems hardly {{likely that}} we are even to-day so lukewarm in our {{interest}} in letters or serious discussion as to be content to reduce our treatment of <b>sex</b> <b>to</b> the standard of a child's library in the supposed interest of a salacious few, or that shame will for long prevent us from adequate portrayal {{of some of the}} most serious and beautiful sides of human nature.|$|E

5|$|The {{day of the}} wedding, Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), {{who wants}} another chance at Finn, {{suggests}} that he reveal that they had <b>sex</b> <b>to</b> boost his popularity at school. He is unwilling to do so, as he truly loves Rachel, who recently admitted to him that she lied when she claimed to have slept with her then-boyfriend Jesse (Jonathan Groff); Finn also lied at the same time, by saying he never had sex with Santana.|$|E
5|$|To appease {{those who}} {{considered}} her <b>sex</b> <b>to</b> {{be the most}} serious obstacle, Maria Theresa assumed masculine titles. Thus, in nomenclature, Maria Theresa was archduke and king; normally, however, she was styled as queen. No 18th-century commentary saw this crossing of gendered titles as inappropriate or impossible.|$|E

5|$|At night, Catelyn {{receives}} a troubling message from her sister, Lord Arryn's widow. She suspects her husband Jon {{was murdered by}} the king's in-laws, the powerful Lannisters.

5|$|Capitalising on anti-French sentiment, {{the paper}} {{went on to}} discuss Bảo Đại's {{upbringing}} in France, claiming that he was already womanising as a teenager because of his European upbringing. Bảo Đại later married an ethnic Vietnamese French citizen, who became Empress Nam Phương, who had been raised Catholic. The editorials accused her of being a French agent and claimed she had treated the queen mother badly, a serious character flaw as Confucianism strongly emphasized respect for elders. Hong Van went on to claim that Bảo Đại's sequence of Gallic lovers was an indication that colonial officials were successfully using <b>sex</b> <b>to</b> turn {{the head of state}} into a puppet of France.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Serb {{being the}} {{favourite}} {{to win the}} title throughout the Championships, Murray overcame Djokovic in a straight sets match that lasted over three hours, {{to become the first}} British winner of the men's singles title since Fred Perry in 1936, the first Scot of either <b>sex</b> <b>to</b> win a Wimbledon singles title since Harold Mahony in 1896, and to extend his winning streak on grass to 18 matches. With the win, he also became only the second man in the open era after Rafael Nadal to hold the Olympic singles gold medal and Wimbledon title simultaneously.|$|E

5|$|Friends with Benefits is a 2011 American {{romantic comedy}} film {{directed}} by Will Gluck, and starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis {{in the lead}} roles. The film features Patricia Clarkson, Jenna Elfman, Bryan Greenberg, Nolan Gould, Richard Jenkins, and Woody Harrelson in supporting roles. The plot revolves around Dylan Harper (Timberlake) and Jamie Rellis (Kunis), who meet in New York City, and naively believe adding <b>sex</b> <b>to</b> their friendship will not lead to complications. Over time, they begin to develop deep mutual feelings for each other, only to deny it each time they are together.|$|E
5|$|In medieval Europe, {{any effort}} to halt {{pregnancy}} was deemed immoral by the Catholic Church, although {{it is believed that}} women of the time still used a number of birth control measures, such as coitus interruptus and inserting lily root and rue into the vagina. Women in the Middle Ages were also encouraged to tie weasel testicles around their thighs during <b>sex</b> <b>to</b> prevent pregnancy. The oldest condoms discovered to date were recovered in the ruins of Dudley Castle in England, and are dated back to 1640. They were made of animal gut, and were most likely used {{to prevent the spread of}} sexually transmitted diseases during the English Civil War. Casanova, living in 18th century Italy, described the use of a lambskin covering to prevent pregnancy; however, condoms only became widely available in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Sycamore {{trees are}} very {{variable}} across their wide range and have strategies to prevent self-pollination, which is undesirable because it limits the genetic {{variation of the}} progeny and may depress their vigour. Most inflorescences are formed of a mixture of functionally male and functionally female flowers. On any one tree, one or other of these flower types opens first and the other type opens later. Some trees may be male-starters in one year and female-starters in another. The change from one <b>sex</b> <b>to</b> the other may take place on different dates {{in different parts of}} the crown, and different trees in any one population may come into bloom over the course of several weeks, so that cross-pollination is encouraged, although self-pollination may not be completely prevented.|$|E

After that, the preacherusually a ministerpresides over a talk during which he reads from the Bible and presents the material to be covered throughout the week. During the talk, {{it is common for}} members of either <b>sex</b> <b>to</b> read a cited verse from the Bible.

Sunday evening services begin with hymns and prayers, after which members of the congregation of both sexes recite from the Bible or sing hymns. A shorter talk is held with the aim of deepening the Sunday School's talk.|$|E

Young women and adolescents are at risk from STIs, pregnancy and unsafe abortion, while older women often have few resources and are disadvantaged with respect to men, and also {{are at risk of}} dementia and abuse, and generally poor health.|$|E
