When Steinman's manager saw it, he responded 'It's a porno movie!' The two-day shoot ran over schedule and budget, costing £35,000 an hour. Russell and Steinman even designed a sequence where a motorcyclist would cycle up the <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> local church-tower, jump out of the turrets at the top, and then explode; alas, the wardens of the church refused permission.|$|E

25|$|A {{music video}} was {{produced}} for the song, directed by Gen Natsume. It {{is set in}} a forest at night, and features Ochi singing the song on the <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wooden hut. Other musicisna surround her in the forest and perform the song alongside her, including a man performing on an upright piano. Additional scenes featured Ochi riding on a white horse, and Ochi staring up at the full moon.|$|E

25|$|In {{complete}} {{contrast to}} the suspended phase of a gallop, when a horse jumps over a fence, the legs are stretched out while in the air, and the front legs hit the ground before the hind legs. Essentially, the horse takes the first two <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> galloping stride on the take-off side of the fence, {{and the other two}} steps on the landing side. A horse has to collect its hindquarters after a jump to strike off into the next stride.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not with}} the {{suspicious}} and timid <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prisoner that she went to meet the conqueror when summoned by him, but rather in the hope and confidence of a mother in distress who goes to see her foster child. On reaching the presence of Nawab she, like an affectionate nurse, walked around the person of Amir-ul-umra, and with sincerity took upon herself all his woes. With tearful in her eyes she narrated the pitiful tale of her misery.|$|E
25|$|The title {{sequence}} for the 40th {{season of}} Monday Night Football featured Hank Williams, Jr. {{seen on the}} <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> building (presumably a museum), surrounded by dancers, football fans, and statues/busts – which, {{along with everyone else}} in the scene, begin to move and dance – patterned after those at the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The transition to Williams Jr. is a book, with the chapter number (in Roman numerals, sequentially with each week) and a tag line about the game to be played that night.|$|E

25|$|Pieces are {{arranged}} in this section so that, if they promote, they promote into the piece above them. Piece names with a grey background are present {{at the start of}} the game; those with a blue background only appear with promotion. Betza's funny notation has been included in brackets for easier reference, with the extension that the notation xxxayyyK stands for an xxxK move possibly followed by an yyyK move, not necessarily in the same direction. Larger numbers of 'legs' can be indicated by repeated application of 'a', or by numbers: thus a3K means a piece that can take up to three <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> king. By default continuation legs can go into all directions, but can be restricted to a single line by a modifier 'v' ("vertical", interpreted relative to the piece's current position on its path). The default modality of all legs is the ability to move and capture: other possibilities are specified explicitly. Thus mKa3K means a piece that takes up to three <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> king, but must stop when it first captures. Square brackets are used to make it clear what legs the a modifier chains together: thus DaK would denote a dabbaba move followed by a king move, but D would denote a piece that can move as a dabbaba, or twice as a king.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> touchdown polymerase {{chain reaction}} cycle have high annealing temperatures. The annealing temperature is decreased in increments for every subsequent set of cycles (the number of individual cycles and increments of temperature decrease is chosen by the experimenter). The primer will anneal at the highest temperature which is least-permissive of nonspecific binding that {{it is able to}} tolerate. Thus, the first sequence amplified is the one between the regions of greatest primer specificity; it is most likely that this is the sequence of interest. These fragments will be further amplified during subsequent rounds at lower temperatures, and will out compete the nonspecific sequences to which the primers may bind at those lower temperatures. If the primer initially (during the higher-temperature phases) binds to the sequence of interest, subsequent rounds of {{polymerase chain reaction}} can be performed upon the product to further amplify those fragments.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, the 1970s Mormon sex {{in chains}} case brought {{increased}} awareness {{of the possibility of}} female-on-male rape. A young Mormon missionary named Kirk Anderson went missing in 1977, in Ewell, Surrey, after being abducted from the <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> church meetinghouse. A few days later, Anderson made a report to the police that he had been abducted and imprisoned against his will. He said that while chained to a bed, Joyce Bernann McKinney attempted to seduce him, and then raped him. News coverage was extensive, in part because the case was considered so anomalous, having involved the rape of a man by a woman. McKinney fled to the US, extradition was not pursued by Britain, and the English court sentenced McKinney in absentia to a year in jail. Under the then-Sexual Offences Act 1956, due to the victim's gender, technically no crime of rape was committed, though indecent assault of a man applied.|$|E

25|$|On October 22, 2014, {{the federal}} {{government}} stated that Abarca had ordered the arrest {{of the students in}} order to prevent them from obstructing a municipal event. The PGR described him and his wife as the probable masterminds of the mass kidnapping. The director of the Iguala police force, Felipe Flores, was also mentioned as one of the main perpetrators. In Mexico City over 50,000 protesters demonstrated in support of the missing students. Joining the protests in Morelia, Michoacán, were members of Mexico's movie industry – actors, directors, writers and producers- who lit 43 candles on the <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Morelia theater. In Venezuela, students also demonstrated in support at the Central University of Venezuela. In the U.S. state of Texas, students and professors rallied at the campus of the University of Texas at El Paso. The name of each disappeared student was read out and signatures were gathered for an open letter of protest to the Mexican consulate. Protests also took place in London, Paris, Vienna and Buenos Aires.|$|E

500|$|Holst's {{absorption}} of folksong, {{not only in}} the melodic sense but in terms of its simplicity and economy of expression, helped to develop a style that many of his contemporaries, even admirers, found austere and cerebral. This is contrary to the popular identification of Holst with The Planets, which Matthews believes has masked his status as a composer of genuine originality. Against charges of coldness in the music, Imogen cites Holst's characteristic [...] "sweeping modal tunes mov reassuringly above the <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> descending bass", while Michael Kennedy points to the 12 Humbert Wolfe settings of 1929, and the 12 Welsh folksong settings for unaccompanied chorus of 1930–31, as works of true warmth.|$|E

For the two-dimensional hard sphere model we show that this algorithm essentially reduces autocorrelation times in vicinity of the transition point. Additionally we discuss modifications of the updating scheme, which perhaps lead to further improvements. ...|$|R
500|$|On 21 May 1946, {{with seven}} colleagues watching, Slotin {{performed}} an experiment {{that involved the}} creation {{of one of the}} first <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fission reaction by placing two half-spheres of beryllium (a neutron reflector) around a [...] plutonium core. The experiment used the same [...] plutonium core that had irradiated Harry Daghlian, later called the [...] "demon core" [...] for its role in the two accidents. Slotin grasped the upper 9-inch beryllium hemisphere with his left hand through a thumb hole at the top while he maintained the separation of the half-spheres using the blade of a screwdriver with his right hand, having removed the shims normally used. Using a screwdriver was not a normal part of the experimental protocol.|$|E
500|$|Louise of Savoy, who had {{remained}} as regent in France during her son's absence, attempted to gather troops and funds {{to defend against}} an expected invasion of Artois by English troops. She also sent a first French mission to Suleiman the Magnificent requesting assistance, but the mission was lost on its way in Bosnia. In December 1525 a second mission was sent, led by John Frangipani, which managed to reach Constantinople, the Ottoman capital, with secret letters asking for the deliverance of king Francis I and {{an attack on the}} Habsburg. Frangipani returned with an answer from Suleiman, on 6 February 1526, initiating the first <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Franco-Ottoman alliance. [...] Suleiman eventually wrote an ultimatum to Charles, asking for the immediate release of Francis—and demanding a yearly tax from the Holy Roman Empire; when this was not forthcoming, the Ottomans launched an invasion of Hungary in the summer of 1526, aiming to reach Vienna.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} the series was officially {{announced}} during UPN's broadcast upfront presentations, Ali Landry, Natalie Desselle-Reid, and Brian Hooks were confirmed to be playing Rita, Janie, and Nick respectively. Bumper Robinson was originally scheduled to portray J.T., but was later replaced by Jason George for undisclosed reasons. The role of Donovan was also recast, with the original actor Eddie McClintock removed in favor of Sean Maguire. The supporting cast of Landry, Desselle-Reid, Hooks, and Maguire were described by Tom Jicha of the Sun-Sentinel as [...] "peripheral" [...] since they were written to [...] "servic the highs and lows of the romance between Shelly and J.T." [...] With Shelly and J.T.'s relationship as {{the heart of the}} sitcom, Janollari expressed hopes that the episodes would follow them [...] "from their meeting in the pilot, through the <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> normal relationship, all the way, hopefully to marriage". In the fall of 2006, TV One began broadcasting the series as part of an agreement with Warner Bros. Domestic Cable Distribution.

500|$|The {{official}} summary {{synopsis of}} the film was published in The Moving Picture World. It states, [...] "A country girl becomes hopelessly stage struck when a company of barnstorming actors, presenting Shakespearean plays, appears in her home town. She applies for an engagement to {{the star of the}} organization and is finally offered a small part. Forbidden by her father to follow the career of her choice, she runs away and joins the company. Disillusionment soon follows. The stars dissatisfied with her attempts at acting, and the hard work and bad hotels soon tax her strength. While playing a one-night stand in a little town, the company is treated to a square meal by a prosperous young drummer [...] who is greatly attracted by the country girl's youth and beauty. The company get into financial straits, and have their baggage seized. Entirely without funds they start to walk to the next town. 'Walking the ties' is as new form of exercise for our heroine, and halfway on the journey she begs the company to go on without her, as she is too weary and sick to continue. Sitting alone and weeping bitterly on the <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> forlorn little railway station, the girl is surprised to see, getting off the train, her new acquaintance, the drummer. He insists upon buying her a ticket for home and starting her off at once. The girl is welcomed back home by her father and when a few weeks later she receives together an offer of a New York engagement and an offer of marriage from the young drummer - she decides to accept the latter, and to appear in the future as - just a wife." ...|$|E
