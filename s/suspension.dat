40|$|In this study, {{research}} and development of automotive active <b>suspensions</b> are reviewed. Structures and models of various automotive <b>suspensions</b> are described. Furthermore, typical commercial products of automotive <b>suspensions</b> are illustrated. Based on the reported studies and development, the authors discus the comparisons between various vehicular <b>suspensions</b> from the aspects of structure, weight, cost, ride comfort, handling performance, reliability, dynamic performance, energy recovery, and commercial maturity. Consequently, it is deduced that electromagnetic active <b>suspensions</b> are the future trend of automotive <b>suspensions</b> due to simple structure, high-bandwidth, accurate and flexible force control, high ride quality, good handling performance, and energy regeneration. At the same time, the issues of future {{research and}} development of electromagnetic active <b>suspensions</b> are proposed. Department of Electrical EngineeringRefereed conference pape...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{stability}} of TiO 2 aqueous <b>suspensions</b> is significant on catalytic efficiency for hydrogen production from water. For improving the {{stability of}} TiO 2 <b>suspensions,</b> a new method that coupling TiO 2 nanoparticles on ZrP nanoplatelets is proposed, which is differ from the traditional methods of adding various surfactants. Comparing 50 days long term stability of three samples, which are TiO 2 <b>suspensions,</b> mixture of TiO 2 and exfoliated ZrP <b>suspensions,</b> exfoliated TiO 2 /ZrP couples <b>suspensions,</b> {{the results show that}} {{the stability of}} exfoliated TiO 2 /ZrP couples <b>suspensions</b> is the best and it could keep 62 % of initial concentration on the 50 th day. TiO 2 nanoparticles could not aggregate into bigger particles as they are loaded on the surface of nanoplatelets is the main reason for improving stability, and the viscosity of exfoliated TiO 2 /ZrP couples <b>suspensions</b> are much higher than TiO 2 <b>suspensions...</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Suspension</b> bridge using iron chains: Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} that many early cultures employed the use of <b>suspension</b> bridges with cabled ropes, the first written evidence of iron chain <b>suspension</b> bridges comes from a local history and topography of Yunnan written in the 15th century, which describes the repair of an iron chain bridge during the reign of the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402–1424); although it is questionable if Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) Chinese claims that iron chain <b>suspension</b> bridges existed since the Han Dynasty, their existence in the 15th century predates that of anywhere else. K.S. Tom mentions this same repaired Ming <b>suspension</b> bridge described by Needham, but adds that recent research has revealed a document which lists the names of those who allegedly built an iron chain <b>suspension</b> bridge in Yunnan around the year 600 AD.|$|E

40|$|All {{mycobacteria}} species {{share some}} antigens, so {{there may be}} cultivable mycobacterial cultures that can provide vaccine protection against leprosy. Vaccine protection against Mycobacterium leprae infections in mice has been demonstrated for M. leprae itself, as living or heat-killed <b>suspensions,</b> and for Mycobacterium bovis (BCG), as living <b>suspensions.</b> Results are reported here with 17 other cultures.

In two experiments the mice were also challenged by footpad injections of 10 (7) heat-killed M. leprae so the footpad enlargment could be measured. That some mycobacterial <b>suspensions</b> were immunogenic for {{some of their own}} antigens was suggested by reactions at the vaccine site and enlargement of the regional lymph nodes.

5|$|When {{the title}} was created, a {{suggested}} medal was drafted and designed by the government. The major difference between this medal and the current medal is {{the design of the}} <b>suspension</b> and the star medallion at the bottom: the top <b>suspension</b> is longer than the bottom, and the bottom star is outlined differently and is adorned with rubies. The <b>suspension</b> was made from gold-plated silver, while the <b>suspension</b> of the current medal is made from gold, as the medal.

40|$|Effect of D―sorbitol {{addition}} on {{rheological properties}} of aqueous alumina <b>suspensions</b> dispersed with poly (acrylic acid) (PAA) was investigated. The {{results showed that}} for the aqueous alumina <b>suspensions</b> with 30 vol%? 40 vol% solids loadings, small amount of D―sorbitol can significantly enhance the stability of alumina <b>suspensions</b> with PAA at pH= 9. 0. When {{the total amount of}} dispersant was 0. 5 wt% and the concentration of D―sorbitol was 20 %, the viscosity of <b>suspensions</b> was the lowest. In addition, the <b>suspensions</b> dispersed with binary dispersant were less sensitive to ionic strength than the <b>suspensions</b> containing just the PAA. The role of PAA and D―sorbitol in the alumina <b>suspensions</b> was characterized by FTIR spectroscope. Based on the rheology and FTIR measurements, a schematic model was established to depict the mechanism for the effect of D―sorbitol in the presence of PAA. D―Sorbitol was absorbed both on alumina surface and the absorbed PAA, leading to an enhanced steric hindrance thus resulting better stability of the <b>suspensions...</b>|$|R

5|$|Because of {{new ideas}} about the {{treatment}} of alcoholism, the lifetime <b>suspension</b> was downgraded to a 10-year <b>suspension</b> in 1952. DUI prosecutions remained difficult in cases when drivers refused to take a Breathalyzer test, and so in 1966, the state authorized the <b>suspension</b> of a person's driver's license for refusing to submit a breath sample. In 1977, the BAC limit was reduced to 0.10%, but the law was modified to differentiate between {{the second and third}} offenses, with lesser penalties for first and second convictions. In 1983, the state established a per se rule wherein a person over the limit was considered drunk in all cases (that is, not merely a presumption). Nine years later, the 0.01% BAC limit for drivers under 21 was instituted, and in 2003, the 0.10% BAC limit was reduced to 0.08% to comply with federal highway funding requirements.|$|E
