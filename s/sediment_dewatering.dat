40|$|PURPOSE: This {{technical}} note examines macrophyte growth response {{to changes in}} sediment nitrogen (N) concentrations due to <b>sediment</b> <b>dewatering</b> and rehydration. Results of this study {{may be used to}} better understand sediment N changes {{as a result of a}} lake drawdown and have impli-cations for control of macrophyte growth. BACKGROUND: Information is needed regarding the impacts of <b>sediment</b> <b>dewatering</b> and rehydration on sediment N dynamics and N availability for macrophyte growth. Research has demonstrated that sediment desiccation, followed by rehydration, can result in the mineralization of organic N to ammonia (De Groot and Van Wijck 1993), which can serve as a source of inorganic N for macrophyte growth. However, little is known about N dynamics during partial <b>sediment</b> <b>dewatering</b> and rehydration. Since sediment N usually regulates the growth of rooted macrophytes (Barko and James 1998), manipulations of aquatic sediment via temporary pool drawdown and dewatering may be desirable to improve (or diminish) sediment N conditions and availability for macrophyte growth in shallow lakes. Pool 8, a run-of-the-river impoundment of the Upper Mississippi River system, underwent water level drawdown during the summer (2001) to dewater and consolidate sediments for stimulation of submersed and emergent macrophyte growth (Scheffe...|$|E

This degradation has significantly increased, in spite of protection of Jamaica Bay since the establishment of Gateway National Park in 1972. The deterioration {{may be caused by}} a variety of processes, some of which may have been initiated prior to the establishment of the park and which may act synergistically. These possible factors include reduced sediment input, an altered pattern of sedimentation, plant die-off, dredging of navigation channels, boat traffic, autocompaction of <b>sediments,</b> <b>dewatering</b> of <b>sediments</b> and relative sea level rise. A variety of remote sensing, field and lab techniques were used to investigate the effects of these factors on Jamaica Bay marshes. It is particularly important to rule out factors that could not be affecting the marshes. A survey of 15 island marshes reveals a 61 % area reduction between 1900 and 1999. Productivity is typical of this region (700 - 1450 g m- 2 yr- 1) but patchy. Large bare spots are now common. This pattern of growth is more consistent with an unfavorable geological environment, and not a toxic environment in which sublethal stunting should occur.

We hypothesize that a feedback system exists in which sediment properties, particularly permeability, affect large-scale heat and fluid circulation and are, in turn, affected by the circulation of fluids. Sediments in the Lau backarc basin display none of the expected trends in physical and acoustic properties {{as a function of}} depth and are probably underconsolidated. The sediments can consolidate normally, however, as shown by measuring both compressional- and shear-wave velocity in a controlled laboratory triaxial setting. In-situ underconsolidation might occur because high sedimentation rates could prevent the <b>sediments</b> from <b>dewatering</b> and consolidating normally, or water lost during the con-solidation process could be rapidly replaced by fluids circulating through the system convectively. Although initial sedimentation rates were extremely high in the Lau Basin, laboratory measurements indicate that the overlying clayey nannofossil oozes are sufficiently permeable to allow the passage of fluids through the sediments on the scale of several years; however, a comparison of vertical and horizontal components of flow indicates that horizontal fluid flow is 3 orders of magnitude greater than vertical flow. The highly permeable vitric silts and sands probably dominate the horizontal component of fluid flow.

40|$|Purpose: In low lying {{areas with}} dense {{networks}} of canals for land drainage, sediments accumulate in the waterways {{and have to}} be periodically dredged. These adjacent areas are mainly used for farming and agriculture and suffer from high rates of subsidence. The recycling of organic amendments, such as sediments, compost and manure, in agricultural soils can improve plant growth and yield, soil carbon content, and microbial biomass and activity, and have the potential to reverse the process of land subsidence. Materials and methods: The effect of mixing bio-waste compost and the solid fraction of swine manure with dredged <b>sediments</b> before <b>dewatering</b> and biochemical ripening was investigated in terms of type and quantity of organic matter, CO 2 production and O 2 consumption, and N, P and S content. The water released during dewatering, the aggregate stability, and the undrained shear strength after ripening were also assessed since these areas have to be assessable by trucks and cattle. Results and discussion: For the sediment with compost and manure the transformations in the type of organic matter, CO 2 production and O 2 consumption were larger compared to the individual fractions, indicating a positive priming effect. Most volume lost during ripening {{can be attributed to the}} loss of water and not to the loss of organic matter. In addition, the mixtures result in very stable aggregates and showed an undrained shear strength three times higher than measured for the sediments.

The study area is located in quadrants A-G, with focus on the D- and western E- quadrants. The availability of new 3 D seismic data in this region allowed accurate mapping and quantification of the fluid flow features present. These features might represent migration pathways for ascending hydrocarbons and can potentially be related to dry wells drilled in the study area. In total, a number of 135 mounded structures have been recognized on the Mid Miocene Unconformity. The focus of {{this research}} is to investigate the relationship between these mounded structures and the underlying polygonal fault system present in the Paleogene sediments. This relationship is examined via quantitative analysis on the polygonal faults, which include azimuth, throw and fault trace length measurements. Results show that areas where fault throw is largest, mounded structures are generally present. Furthermore, a positive relation exists between the mound height and magnitude of the underlying fault throw. These relationships combined with the characteristics found on 3 D seismic data, indicate that the mounds most likely originate from remobilized <b>sediments.</b> Fluids <b>dewatering</b> from the underlying polygonal faulted sequence resulted in the entrainment and expulsion of these sediments on the paleo seafloor.

40|$|Hydrate Ridge is an accretionary thrust ridge {{located on}} the lower slope of the central Cascadia {{convergent}} margin. Structural mapping based on two-dimensional and three-dimensional multichannel seismic reflection profiles and gridded bathymetry coupled with deep-towed sidescan sonar data and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) biostratigraphy suggests that seafloor fluid venting patterns are likely controlled by the seaward-vergent (SV) structural style at northern Hydrate Ridge (NHR) and by the dominantly landward-vergent (LV) structural style at southern Hydrate Ridge (SHR). North-south structural variability across Hydrate Ridge is coincident with the seafloor authigenic carbonate distribution, which varies from aerially extensive authigenic carbonate crusts at NHR to a minor focused occurrence of authigenic carbonate at SHR. The older stratigraphy exposed at the seafloor at NHR (> 1. 6 – 1. 7 Ma) has likely been subjected to a longer history of <b>sediment</b> compaction, <b>dewatering,</b> and deformation than the younger slope basin strata preserved at SHR (1. 7 Ma to recent), suggesting the extent of carbonates at NHR may result from a longer history of fluid flow and/or more intense venting through a more uplifted, lithified, and fractured NHR sequence. Furthermore, recent work at SHR shows that the major seafloor fluid venting site there is fed by fluid flow through a volcanic ash–bearing turbidite sequence, suggesting stratigraphic conduits for fluid flow may be important in less uplifted, LV-dominated portions of Hydrate Ridge. In addition, the variability in structural style observed at Hydrate Ridge may have implications for the distributions and concentrations of fluids and gas hydrates in other accretionary settings and {{play a role in}} the susceptibility of accretionary ridges to slope failure...|$|R
40|$|Drilling on Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 170, {{offshore}} Costa Rica {{indicates that}} the entire incoming sedimentary section is underthrust. Thus, observed changes in the thickness of underthrust sediments as they are progressively buried beneath the margin wedge provide a direct measure of the rate and magnitude of <b>sediment</b> <b>dewatering.</b> Laboratory consolidation tests indicate that in situ excess pore-fluid pressures within the underthrust section range from 1. 3 MPa {{at the top of}} the section to 3. 1 MPa near the base. The inferred pore pressure profile implies that fluids escape the uppermost sediments most rapidly, whereas the basal sediments remain essentially undrained. This interpretation suggests that the sedimentary and underlying ocean crustal hydrologic systems are decoupled. We use a simple model of fluid flow to demonstrate that dewatering of the underthrust sediments can occur via lateral flow only if sediment permeability is strongly anisotropic, or if flow is focused along permeable stratigraphic layers. If significant dewatering occurs by vertical fluid flow, it must occur within closely spaced, high-permeabilit...|$|E
40|$|Sediment {{compaction}} at convergent margins expels pore fluids, {{which in}} turn influence many aspects of subduction zone geology. Drilling in the Barbados Ridge complex during ODP Leg 110 and DSDP Leg 78 A provided information about sediment types, porosities, and the geometry of the complex. In this paper, we use these observations to estimate the rates of sediment porosity loss and accompanying fluid expulsion from the prism, the decollement, and the under-thrust sediments. Rates of porosity loss depend on how rapidly the sediments move arcward through the complex. We compute rates of sediment movement in the prism and decollement {{as a function of}} distance from the deformation front. This calculation assumes that the rates of sediment movement decrease arcward as the result of porosity loss in the prism and decollement and thickening of the prism. According to computed rates of sediment movement for the prism, sediment deceleration is greatest within the first 3 to 5 km arcward from the deformation front. Similarly, most dewatering of the prism sediments takes place in this region. Beyond 5 km, rates of <b>sediment</b> <b>dewatering</b> become great est in the underthrust sediments, assuming these sediments are carried downward at a uniform rate with the oceanic plate...|$|E

Mud-filled dewatering veins occur in four styles: wide discrete gashes, veins along extensional microfaults, tension-gash arrays, and injections into tension gashes about slump-fold noses. Mud veins occur at shallow depths, less than 10 meters below sea floor (mbsf) in some cases, but some also were recovered {{as deep as}} 423 mbsf. Mud vein fill is slightly different in composition than the matrix and consists of {{a higher proportion of}} very fine silica, and in some cases, more authigenic carbonate or iron sulfide, transported into the veins by fluid flow. Clay minerals and many diatom fragments that are subhorizontal outside the veins have been rotated within the veins to parallel the vein walls. Formation of mud veins occurs during <b>sediment</b> <b>dewatering,</b> perhaps initiated by the collapse of diatom frustules during compaction, or by overloading during downslope slumping and sliding. Complex multigenerational vein sets exhibit sequential development from wide discrete gashes to injections along microfaults to dense arrays of sigmoidal tension gashes, with progressive deformation of older veins during continued downslope movement. Critical factors required to produce mud veins are high sedimentation rates, relatively high porosity and resistance to compaction, and low permeability; vein preservation is enhanced by anoxic conditions that discourage bioturbation. Carbonate-filled veins in Peru margin samples include tension gashes and wide, banded zones filled with calcite or dolomite spar; these probably result from filling of open fractures. Some sparry veins are crosscut by dewatering veins filled with calcareous mud, suggesting that the carbonate veins begin to form very early, before mud interbeds have de watered...|$|E

Next, 0. 2 m 3 tubes of the selected material were filled with sediment and used for laboratory experiments based on the actual execution, confirming the dewatering speed and filtering effectiveness of the method. The trial applied 2 patterns (5 cases) based on the test results. (1) Filling high density tubes with sediment already containing coagulant.

This technical note provides an overview of physical separation (soil washing) concepts, and methods for calculating volumes of recoverable material meeting beneficial use (BU) requirements. The other technical notes address data acquisition for volume estimation. The second (Olin-Estes and Palermo 2000) outlines a prescriptive approach, using existing infor-mation obtained from limited sampling, to estimate volumes meeting BU requirements. The third (Olin-Estes 2000) introduces statistical methods for developing a more extensive sampling plan, and methods of organizing and interpreting data. BACKGROUND: Contaminated dredged material is often placed in confined disposal facilities (CDFs), but as land development and acquisition costs continue to rise, there is a growing shortage of CDF storage capacity.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the implications of}} drying and flooding effects on nutrient release from sediments in wetlands. It {{discusses the}} role of sediment properties, phosphorus and nitrogen transformations, carbon cycling, drawdown and macrophyte control, and modelling. Finally, comments on management issues are made. In summary: Drying and refilling cause substantial changes in water quality. The effect depends on 1. Sediment properties (sediment composition; nutrient and organic content); 2. type of drawdown (gravity or evaporative); 3. severity of drying (proportion of drying area, rate of drawdown, degree of dewatering, temperature and time of sediment drying and weathering); 4. conditions of refilling (origin of water, degree of sediment disturbance). Sediment properties {{are the key to}} physical, chemical and biological changes during drying and reflooding, as they affect nutrient transformations and exchange between sediment and water. Changes may include particle aggregation and sediment consolidation, phosphorus adsorption and desorption; organic degradation, nitrogen transformation, and stimulation of microbial processes. Phosphorus transformations in sediments during drawdown depend on many factors. There is a higher probability of stimulating phosphorus release than of reducing phosphorus concentration during the reflooding of dried sediments, particularly in organic-rich wetlands. Stimulation of phosphorus release and algal production is most likely to result from an evaporative drawdown event. Concentrations of inorganic nitrogen (ammonia and nitrate) often increase during or after drawdown, although the effect may be short-term. Such release has the potential to stimulate N-limited algal blooms. Drawdown has been used effectively in controlling macrophytes. The levels of <b>sediment</b> <b>dewatering,</b> freezing or hot climate conditions generally determine the levels of macrophyte reduction. However, control of macrophytes is often species specific.

[...] 1 pageThe recent {{occurrence}} of large earthquakes {{and the discovery}} of deep fluid seepage calls for a revision of the postulated hydrogeological inactivity and low seismic activity of old oceanic transform-type plate boundaries. Both processes are intrinsically associated. The COST Action FLOWS seeks to merge the expertise {{of a large number}} of research groups and supports the development of multidisciplinary knowledge on how seep fluid (bio) chemistry relates to seismicity. It aims to identify (bio) geochemical proxies for the detection of precursory seismic signals and to develop innovative physico-chemical sensors for deep-ocean seismogenic faults. At present, study areas include the Azores-Gibraltar Fracture Zone and the North Anatolian Fault which have generated some of the most devastating earthquakes in Europe. Here we present the latest results from recently-discovered deep-sea mud volcanoes (MVs) located at the rim of the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain, western Gulf of Cadiz (NE Atlantic Ocean). An analysis of the molecular and isotopic composition of hydrocarbon and noble gases is performed on fluids collected at the newly-discovered seeps and in MVs located across the active sedimentary wedge of the Gulf of Cadiz. The tectonic and seismic environments involved vary. However, all active seeps are located along crustal strike-slip faults, which clearly control the seepage of the deep-sourced fluids. Our results yield insights into the effects of the interplay of petroleum migration/trapping, deep <b>sediment</b> <b>dewatering</b> and gas hydrate formation on the geochemical signature of natural gas in deep marine sediments. The cross-disciplinary approach fostered by the FLOWS project yields first indications on the relations between tectonics and seismicity and the secondary processes that shape the geochemical compositions of the fluids transported from deeply buried sediments to the seafloor.

40|$|Dredging {{has evolved}} into a highly {{sophisticated}} process drawing from some of the latest technology. The methods of navigational dredging range from clamshell buckets to sophisticated hydraulic dredges. More recently, these techniques have evolved into the processes used for environmental dredging applications. High concentrations of certain contaminants in sediments pose human heath and ecological risks. Dredging of contaminated sediment provides a method of removal of these contaminants of concern (COC). One of the most obvious benefits of environmental dredging is the fact the contaminated sediments are permanently removed from the water body. These sediments are typically disposed of in an upland containment facility or landfill. In some cases disposal of contaminates may not be permitted or the costs to transport them to a permitted facility may be very high. Alternate uses for the contaminated sediments may be considered and may help to reduce or eliminate risks. The cost of these alternate treatment and use methods must be evaluated against other permit-able disposal options. Of paramount concern when dredging is the ability of the process to remove the COCs to a level that is below the regulated concentration. Although dredging techniques have been demonstrated to reduce sediment contaminant concentrations, it appears that these techniques can result in residual contamination. This residual contamination {{may be the result of}} re-suspension of contaminates into the water column or sloughing of adjacent materials into the dredged areas. Concern over these residual concentrations may lead to subsequent passes or other means to minimize risk from the residuals. The impacts of the cleanup activity to the surrounding area need to be evaluated regarding the impact of the operation or long-term disturbance of an area. A dredging operation will typically require some sort of <b>sediment</b> <b>dewatering</b> process. After removal of the solids, the associated water may have to be treated before it can be discharged back into the waterway. Because of these facts a dredging operation typically requires onshore support facilities. Construction of these facilities will likely impact the area surrounding the dredged area...|$|E

Methane-derived authigenic carbonates are precipitated in the uppermost terrigenous <b>sediments</b> by sub-duction-induced <b>dewatering.</b> They {{can be divided into}} cemented silts and sands containing less than 10 % carbonate cements and concretions composed partially or wholly of carbonate. Textures, chemical compositions, and carbon and oxygen isotope signatures of 64 specimens of mainly carbonate concretions from Ocean Drilling Program Sites 889 / 890, 891, and 892 were studied using different methods. Mineralogically, the carbonate cement consists of high-magnesian calcite, dolomite, and cal-cite with varying amounts of detrital constituents. Results from x-ray fluorescence, x-ray diffraction, and electron microprobe analyses suggest dominance of high magnesian calcite in most of the carbonate concretions. Complex carbonates and protodo-lomite to pure dolomite are found in minor amounts. Cemented sediments and concretions taken in the vicinity of a prominent fault zone at Site 892 show an almost pure calcitic composition and the most intense deformation of all material drilled in the Cascadia Margin.

We hypothesized {{that for the}} same dewatering event: (1) organic, silt and coarse sediments rank along a gradient of water deficit, with which community resistance and resilience decrease; (2) species survival dur- ing the event depend on their known ecological affinity for water; and (3) a peak in species richness associated with an intermediate water deficit occurs in silty habitats. Location: Riverine wetlands in the floodplain of the Ain River, France. Methods: Eighteen sampling units were defined, set over three sediment types: gravel-dominated coarse sediment, silt and organic matter-dominated sediment. For each sediment type, three sampling units were permanently aquatic, and three sampling units underwent summer dewatering. A survey of species cover was conducted in each sampling unit at four times: before summer dewatering, {{at the beginning of}} the event, at the end of the event and 2 months after rewet- ting. Community resistance and resilience were assessed, as were changes over time in the proportions of species according their water affinity (hydrophytes, amphiphytes and helophytes, documented from the floras), and the effect of dewatering on species renewal and richness. Results: The sediment type affected aquatic plant community resistance and resilience, with increasing disturbance intensity for silty, followed by coarse compared with organic sediment. Organic sediment retained water efficiently during dewatering, supporting high community resistance, with the mainte- nance of amphiphytes and more tolerant hydrophytes. On silty sediment, disturbance was sufficiently high to cause the disappearance of hydrophyte vegetative parts, but propagules rapidly sprouted after rewetting, suggesting their preservation in the sediment and enabling good community resilience. On coarse sediment, a decrease in resident amphiphyte abundance, together with helophyte colonization and maintenance after rewetting were observed. Coarse sediment is not favourable to propagule survival, explaining the low community resilience. Contrary to our hypothesis, a linear positive relation- ship between disturbance intensity and species richness was observed after dewatering. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that a simple description of sedi- ment type allows prediction of dewatering impact on aquatic plant communi- ties: organic, silt and coarse sediments were ranked along a gradient of water deficit, along which resistance and resilience decreased...|$|R

Irregular ring shaped depressions are widely developed {{on the floor}} of Lake Superior. They are typically between 200 and 300 meters across. The troughs that define these rings are typically 10 to 30 meters wide and up to five meters deep. High resolution multibeam bathymetric data show that the lake floor rings are actually chains of individual bathymetric pocks. In Lake Superior bathymetric pocks have been observed as isolated features, irregular polygonal rings, and closely grouped ring networks. The Lake Superior basin contains sediments deposited during the last deglaciation of the basin. The glacial and post-glacial sediments sit atop Precambrian basement rocks. These bathymetric ring features have not been commonly reported elsewhere. Pockmarks, however, have been observed globally and are typically the result of expelled fluids or gases. A series of high resolution, single-channel seismic data sets were collected in addition to high resolution multibeam bathymetry to test the working hypothesis that Lake Superior’s rings are the result of <b>sediment</b> <b>dewatering.</b> The vast depth of the Thunder Bay trough provides an ideal location to study these features, protected from wave base erosion. The results confirm the existence of three types of dewatering structures associated with the lake floor rings. These features include two deep-sourced and one shallow dewatering structure(s). The evidence suggests that the rings were produced by the expulsion of fluid from the lake floor at, or close to, the termination of glaciolacustrine deposition in the basin. This places the formation of these unusual features {{around the time of the}} last eastward overflow from Lake Agassiz directly into Lake Superior. Abrupt lake level change linked to the Agassiz overflow is believed to have triggered basin wide expulsion of pore water leading to the formation of the lake floor rings...|$|E
40|$|Tight-gas {{sandstone}} reservoirs of the Upper Cretaceous Mesaverde Group in the Greater Natural Buttes (GNB) Field have variable fluid saturations {{along with}} low matrix porosity and permeability. In {{order to build}} more reliable saturation models, it is significant to determine resistivity of formation water {{which is one of}} the input parameters in water saturation calculations. This study mainly investigates how formation water resistivity and salinity vary stratigraphically and spatially. For petrophysical analysis, the study interval was divided into seven stratigraphic zones based on net-to-gross ratio and variation in resistivity. Formation water resistivity derived from Pickett-plot analysis was used with formation temperature to determine formation water salinity distribution per zone. Temperature data from production logs show that the Wasatch Formation and Mesaverde Group have higher geothermal gradients than formations that are stratigraphically above. Therefore, formation temperature was estimated using these gradients which are consistent through the study interval. Petrophysical analysis indicates more fresh water is present in the western part of the study area coinciding with the trace of a basement fault. Salinity decreases stratigraphically downward while water saturation is variable within the study interval. Average formation water resistivity per zone ranges between 0. 048 ohm-m to 0. 064 ohm-m based on Pickett-plot analysis, while average formation water salinity per zone ranges between 55, 000 ppm to 86, 000 ppm. Furthermore, the average effective bulk-volume water is nearly constant around 3. 5 % suggesting that as being a basin-centered gas accumulation, most sandstones within the study interval are close to irreducible water saturation. A combination of different geological mechanisms might account for observed salinity variations. The increase in freshness stratigraphically downward may be due to basement faulting and associated natural fracture system enhancing upward movement of fresher formation water. In addition, coal and <b>sediment</b> <b>dewatering</b> in stratigraphic units below study interval might be the source of fresher formation water in this potentially closed hydrological system, whereas distinct horizontal layering and continuity of different petrophysical rock types might result in observed salinity trends in the area...|$|E
40|$|Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc. (Jacobs) and Sevenson Environmental Services, Inc. (Sevenson) are {{conducting}} remedial {{activities at the}} New Bedford Harbor Superfund Site (Site) under contract with the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Funding and oversight for this project {{is provided by the}} US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) through the national Superfund Program. The Site is located in Bristol County, Massachusetts, approximately 55 miles south of Boston. Contamination at the Site consists of marine sediments impacted by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and heavy metals from industrial activities adjacent to the shoreline. 	The selected remedial alternative for the Site involves hydraulic dredging for removal of the PCB-impacted sediment. Following removal, the remedy includes sand separation, <b>sediment</b> <b>dewatering,</b> wastewater treatment, and sediment transportation to an off-site disposal facility. 	In 2004 and 2005, the Team (Jacobs, Sevenson, USACE and EPA) solved a number of technical challenges related to dredging in this unique marine setting. Upon initiation of dredging in 2004, hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) gas at concentrations exceeding OSHA’s current permissible exposure levels, was immediately released from the marine sediments into an enclosed treatment facility. The elevated H 2 S concentrations were mitigated through engineering controls consisting of chemical treatment and local exhaust ventilation to carbon treatment. Ferric sulfate (Fe 2 (SO 4) 3) was injected into the dredge slurry to reduce or eliminate H 2 S by precipitating ferric sulfide (FeS). A high volume air extraction system was installed to capture any un-reacted H 2 S. A second challenge involved maintaining the required dredge production despite the presence of debris embedded in the sediment. To overcome this challenge, unique equipment was designed to remove the debris while maintaining the low water column turbidity thresholds established for environmental protection. A third challenge presented to the Team was the accurate monitoring of the vertical and horizontal progress of the dredging in the shallow tidal marine setting. This was accomplished by using a combination of tools, including a Global Positioning System (GPS), laser level soundings, and acoustic bathymetric surveys. 	Resolving these technical challenges allowed the Team {{to reduce the risk of}} personal injury and increase overall productivity. The lessons learned on the New Bedford dredging program can be applied to other freshwater and marine dredging environments where success is measured not only in sediment removal rates per day, but in worker safety metrics and process quality control...|$|E
40|$|International audienceQuestionsThe {{effect of}} {{dewatering}} on aquatic plant communities may vary with sediment properties, such as particle size and organic matter content, as both control water retention in the <b>sediment</b> during <b>dewatering.</b> No study has tested how sediment type affects the short-term response of plant communities to dewatering. We hypothesized {{that for the}} same dewatering event: (1) organic, silt and coarse sediments rank along a gradient of water deficit, with which community resistance and resilience decrease; (2) species survival during the event depend on their known ecological affinity for water; and (3) a peak in species richness associated with an intermediate water deficit occurs in silty habitats. LocationRiverine wetlands in the floodplain of the Ain River, France. MethodsEighteen sampling units were defined, set over three sediment types: gravel-dominated coarse sediment, silt and organic matter-dominated sediment. For each sediment type, three sampling units were permanently aquatic, and three sampling units underwent summer dewatering. A survey of species cover was conducted in each sampling unit at four times: before summer dewatering, {{at the beginning of}} the event, at the end of the event and 2 months after rewetting. Community resistance and resilience were assessed, as were changes over time in the proportions of species according their water affinity (hydrophytes, amphiphytes and helophytes, documented from the floras), and the effect of dewatering on species renewal and richness. ResultsThe sediment type affected aquatic plant community resistance and resilience, with increasing disturbance intensity for silty, followed by coarse compared with organic sediment. Organic sediment retained water efficiently during dewatering, supporting high community resistance, with the maintenance of amphiphytes and more tolerant hydrophytes. On silty sediment, disturbance was sufficiently high to cause the disappearance of hydrophyte vegetative parts, but propagules rapidly sprouted after rewetting, suggesting their preservation in the sediment and enabling good community resilience. On coarse sediment, a decrease in resident amphiphyte abundance, together with helophyte colonization and maintenance after rewetting were observed. Coarse sediment is not favourable to propagule survival, explaining the low community resilience. Contrary to our hypothesis, a linear positive relationship between disturbance intensity and species richness was observed after dewatering. ConclusionThe present study demonstrates that a simple description of sediment type allows prediction of dewatering impact on aquatic plant communities: organic, silt and coarse sediments were ranked along a gradient of water deficit, along which resistance and resilience decreased...|$|R
30|$|It is {{generally}} considered that the magnetization of sediments is stabilized through post-depositional remanent magnetization (PDRM) processes (Irving and Major 1964; Kent 1973). The fixing of magnetic particles in a sedimentary column is thought to occur gradually within a zone due to <b>sediment</b> compaction and <b>dewatering,</b> which generates an offset between the depth where the magnetization is fixed and the sediment surface (e.g., Verosub 1977; Hyodo 1984). This offset {{is referred to as}} the “lock-in depth” of PDRM and has been the focus of much debate for a long time (e.g., Okada and Niitsuma 1989; deMenocal et al. 1990; Tauxe et al. 1996, 2006; Channell and Guyodo 2004). Suganuma et al. (2010, 2011) convincingly showed that magnetization in a sedimentary column takes place within a zone just below the base of the bioturbation zone. Based on direct comparisons of 10 Be flux and paleomagnetic records through the Matuyama-Brunhes transition in deep-sea cores, they deduced by means of a Gaussian lock-in function that the thickness of the zone of magnetization is approximately 17  cm, regardless of the sedimentation rate. This indicates that sedimentary sequences with accumulation rates that exceed 17  cm/kyr are enough to reconstruct records of past geomagnetic field fluctuations with a time resolution of 1  kyr. Although the PDRM process is uncertain and still under debate, it is possible to minimize the length of delay and smoothing width in remanence acquisition due to the PDRM process by using a sediment sequence that has as high a sedimentation rate as possible.|$|R

40|$|Centrifugation of {{activated}} sludge is a frequently used dewatering process {{but there is}} a need for a fitting function for moderate and high sludge concentrations. In particular, liquid phase accumulation kinetics during centrifugation may be used as a source of information about sedimentation properties and governing mechanism of the cake formation. This will allow the obtention of the optimal parameters for the dewatering control and process optimisation. For this purpose, {{activated sludge}} at different concentrations was investigated on a laboratory centrifuge with centrifugation factor 2667. The following sludges were used in the experiments: 1) activated sludge from thickener (with and without floculant treatment); 2) sludge after industrial centrifuge decanter Flottweg Z 62 - 4 collected from dumping pound; sludge (2) after anaerobic treatment; sludge (2) with a dispersed solid additive. Based on the obtained data, the following assumption was made: settling of the solid phase and cake compaction depends on the hindered settling velocity and sediment compression. Due to the applied centrifuge force, a primary cake skeleton from particular aggregates and flocs is formed. During this stage, free water is displaced from the space between aggregates/flocs with a further transition to the compaction of the sediment with the water being displaced from the pores of the flocs by a filtration mechanism until an equilibrium condition is reached. The liquid volume V vs. time t at hindered settling and <b>sediment</b> <b>dewatering</b> can be represented in the form Vα tⁿ, where n ≤ 1. 0. Therefore, in log-log coordinates, the kinetics of liquid accumulation have a linear dependence lg(V) α n lg(t) in both settling and compaction stages. This assumption was confirmed for different types of activated sludge. Using asymptotical analysis in the function form F(t,V), a dimensionless fitting function was obtained that describes the centrifugation of activated sludge. For highly concentrated sludge, it was found that the dewatering occurs as cake compression. Analysis of deformation models leads to the conclusion that for the compressible cake it is necessary to introduce a parameter characterising the cake plasticity dependence on the centrifugation time. Developed model was used for fitting numerous experimental data. The main advantage of proposed model is the possibility to fit the liquid phase accumulation kinetics during centrifugation in a wide range of the activated sludge concentration, from suspension up to structured and paste-like cake consistency. The extension of this model to other slurries requires further investigation...|$|E
40|$|On active tectonic margins methane-rich pore fluids are {{expelled}} during the <b>sediment</b> compaction and <b>dewatering</b> that accompany accretionary wedge development. Once these fluids reach the shallow subsurface they become oxidized and precipitate cold seep authigenic carbonates. Faults or high-porosity stratigraphic horizons {{can serve as}} conduits for fluid flow, which {{can be derived from}} deep within the wedge and/or, if at seafloor depths greater than ∼ 300 m, from the shallow source of methane and water contained in subsurface and surface gas hydrates. The distribution of fluid expulsion sites can be mapped regionally using sidescan sonar systems, which record the locations of surface and slightly buried authigenic carbonates due to their impedence contrast with the surrounding hemipelagic sediment. Hydrate Ridge lies within the gas hydrate stability field offshore central Oregon and during the last 15 years several studies have documented gas hydrate and cold seep carbonate occurrence in the region. In 1999, we collected deep-towed SeaMARC 30 sidescan sonar imagery across the Hydrate Ridge region to determine the spatial distribution of cold seep carbonates and their relationship to subsurface structure and the underlying gas hydrate system. High backscatter on the imagery is divided into three categories, (I) circular to blotchy with apparent surface roughness, (II) circular to blotchy with no apparent surface roughness, and (III) streaky to continuous with variable surface roughness. We interpret the distribution of high backscatter, as well as the locations of mud volcanoes and pockmarks, to indicate variations in the intensity and activity of fluid flow across the Hydrate Ridge region. Seafloor observations and sampling verify the acoustic signals across the survey area and aid in this interpretation. Subsurface structural mapping and swath bathymetry suggest the fluid venting is focused at the crests of anticlinal structures like Hydrate Ridge and the uplifts along the Daisy Bank fault zone. Geochemical parameters link authigenic carbonates on Hydrate Ridge to the underlying gas hydrate system and suggest that some of the carbonates have formed in equilibrium with fluids derived directly from the destabilization of gas hydrate. This suggests carbonates are formed not only from the methane in ascending fluids from depth, but also from the shallow source of methane released during the dissociation of gas hydrate. The decreased occurrence of high-backscatter patches and the dramatic reduction in pockmark fields, imaged on {{the eastern part of the}} survey, suggest gas hydrate near its upper stability limit may be easily destabilized and thus, responsible for these seafloor features. High backscatter along the left-lateral Daisy Bank fault suggests a long history of deep-seated fluid venting, probably unrelated to destabilized gas hydrate in the subsurface...|$|R
40|$|Salt diapirs {{are some}} of the most dynamic {{geological}} structures in sedimentary basins and vertical rise through their overburdens leads to the development of complex fault systems. Polygonal fault systems constitute a major structural element of fine-grained sediments in sedimentary basins, forming without the requirement of tectonic extension during the early burial phase of <b>sediment</b> compaction and <b>dewatering.</b> These same fine-grained sedimentary overburdens are also deformed by salt diapirs and their associated fault systems in basins such as the Gulf of Mexico, the South Atlantic margins and the North Sea. The aim of this research was to investigate the interactions between salt diapirism and faulting in overburdens deformed by polygonal fault systems using 3 D seismic data sets from the Central North Sea and the extensional domain of the Espírito Santo Basin on the SE continental margin of Brazil. In both case studies the regional isotropic planform arrangements of polygonal faults mapped in the post-salt overburden have preferred (radial) orientations around salt stocks, orthogonal alignments with tectonic faults and salt walls, and concentric arrangements in withdrawal basins. Radial faults around salt stocks are invariably layer-bound, conforming to the same discrete layer of stratigraphy as laterally equivalent to layer-bound polygonal fault systems. In the Espírito Santo Basin, the lateral distribution and stacking of polygonal faults is heavily influenced by the distribution of proximal and distal seismic facies. In the Central North Sea spacing, throw and fault length vary as a function of tier thickness. Polygonal and radial faults in the same tier have a similar range of maximum throws and spacing but differ in length and aspect ratios. Radial faults are classified as perturbed members of the basin-wide polygonal fault system which propagate primarily under the influence of compaction and contraction but in an anisotropic stress field. Stacked arrays of layer-bound radial and polygonal faults formed sequentially where upper tier boundaries date the cessation of fault activity. The radial fault zone is between 2 - 4 stock radii wide. The radial fault zone expanded as salt growth intensified or widened, and contracted as they slowed or became narrower. However, the width of the radial fault zone is not related to the hinge in the domed overburden discrediting arching as mechanism forming the radial faults. Instead, the transition boundary separating zones of radial and polygonal faults in a tier is interpreted to reflect the lateral-extent of hoop stress around salt stocks during faulting. An upward change in the regional polygonal planform and dip polarity of polygonal faults in the Espírito Santo Basin is attributed to a change in the regional stress field during the cessation of thin-skinned extension and gravity gliding and the onset of inversion. The results of this thesis highlight the sensitivity of polygonal fault system to local stress anisotropy and provide a potential route for reconstructing the palaeostate of stress around salt diapirs...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the {{beneficial}} use of dredged sediments to reverse land subsidence in lowlands and delta areas is explored. The major constraints for beneficial use of sediments are the contaminant concentrations, {{and the proper}} managing {{of supply and demand}} of  sediments (Chapter 1). When sediments are transferred from waterways to upland conditions, a series of processes take place that transform the waterlogged sediments into aerated soils, a process known as ripening. To understand the relation between the sediments and the soils formed, physical/chemical and biological processes were studied at three scales: laboratory scale, mesoscale, and field scale. The knowledge obtained with these experiments can provide guidelines to effectively use dredged sediments to reverse land subsidence. In the laboratory experiments, the environmental conditions were controlled, leading to constant water content and optimal oxygen concentration for biological processes. In the mesoscale experiment, the environmental parameters such as wind, precipitation and temperature, were not controlled as the 1 m 3 containers used for these experiments were placed outside, in open air conditions. Still, the water level could be monitored and controlled, and the subsidence of the dredged sediment could be monitored. In the field experiment, the environmental and filling conditions could not be controlled but the changes occurring in the deposit were monitored. In the first laboratory experiment (Chapter 2) the behaviour of dredged sediments with varying particle size distribution and organic matter content was studied. The dredged sediments were dewatered using suction chambers and then submitted to biochemical ripening during 141 days. The five types of dredged sediments had similar overall behaviour. The most significant observation was that most volume lost during dewatering and biochemical ripening was due to shrinkage and not to organic matter mineralization. Furthermore, the type of organic matter changed in the direction of humification, i. e., more stable compounds were formed. The soils formed from biochemical ripening of dredged sediments had very stable aggregates and the load-bearing capacity was enough to sustain cattle and tractors. The second laboratory experiment (Chapter 3) was designed to investigate the influence of mixing compost and the solid fraction of swine manure (low in nutrients) with dredged <b>sediments</b> on <b>dewatering</b> and biochemical ripening. When the supply of dredged sediments is too low to compensate for land subsidence, bio-wastes, such as compost and manure, can be mixed with the sediments to reverse land subsidence. The results of this experiment confirm that most volume lost during ripening was due to shrinkage and not due to organic matter mineralization. Adding compost or the solid fraction of manure to the dredged sediments enhances the changes in the type of organic matter and CO 2 production, i. e., the addition results in increased rates of organic matter mineralization which is described in the literature as the priming effect.  In addition, the undrained shear strength of the mixtures of sediments with compost or manure was three times higher than the measured values for the sediments alone, meaning that organic amendments will improve the characteristics of the soil formed from ripening of sediments. The mesoscale experiment (Chapter 4) was performed during 400 days in 1 m 3 containers which allowed to control the water level. Two scenarios were tested: upland deposits in which the sediments are allowed to dry; and underwater deposits in which the water level is always 2 cm above the sediments. It was expected that the upland deposit conditions would lead to a higher subsidence than the underwater conditions. However, subsidence of the sediments was very similar for the two scenarios. Also in these experiments it was observed that most subsidence could be attributed to shrinkage and not organic matter mineralization, and the type of organic matter changed in the direction of humification. Furthermore, the water balance indicated that evapotranspiration results in higher loss of water than drainage. Still, in this case the undrained shear strength after 400 days of experiment was not enough to sustain cattle or tractors even though it increased with time. The monitored field scale upland deposit of dredged sediments (Chapter 5) is located in the Wormer- en Jisperveld area – North Holland, the Netherlands. The deposit was filled in two stages reaching a maximum height of sediments of 195 cm. After 17 months of monitoring, the subsidence of the sediments was 119 cm to which an extra subsidence of 19. 5 cm of the underlying soil due to the overburden pressure was added. The results observed in the upland deposit are in line with the laboratory and mesoscale results since subsidence could also be attributed to shrinkage and no significant changes in the organic matter content were observed. However, {{in the case of the}} upland deposit, the type of organic matter changed in the direction of humification during the first 8 months (March to November), then stabilized during 7 months (November to June), and changed in the direction of mineralization afterwards. The outcomes of this research indicate that dredged sediments have the potential to reverse land subsidence. This statement is supported by the consistent results showing that the decrease in volume of dredged sediments is caused by shrinkage and not to organic matter mineralization as traditionally reported (Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5). In addition, in places where composted and stable bio-wastes are available, these can be added to dredged sediments to further reverse land subsidence. Still, in this case special attention should be given to the potential priming effect (Chapter 3). Finally it is recommended to adapt the current practices of disposal of dredged sediments in upland deposits, since 19. 5 cm of subsidence observed for the underlying soil in the upland deposit (Chapter 5), was caused by the overburden pressure of the dredged sediment. From the point of view of avoiding/reversing land subsidence it is recommended to spread thin layers (in the order of cm) of sediments over the land, although this might lead to an increase in the time and costs for the stakeholders involved in dredging and in managing the water boards...|$|R
