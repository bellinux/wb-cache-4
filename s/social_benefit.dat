5|$|At Dunder-Mifflin, Clark Green (Clark Duke) {{returns from}} his stint as Jan Levinson's (Melora Hardin) sexual assistant. Despite the awkward {{past couple of}} weeks, Jan has gifted them an espresso machine, {{and the rest of}} the office jumps on the {{opportunity}} to 'test' out several espresso flavors. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) enlists Clark's help to snag a newly freed account at a suit warehouse; the two will pose as a father and son so that they can successfully sell to the Stones, father and son owners of the warehouse. Dwight leads off on how proud he is of Clark to elder Stone (Ed Lauter), but when Stone admits that he and his son are not on good terms, Dwight and Clark awkwardly shift gears and begin a show of childishly sniping at each other. Clark tries to move on to business, but Dwight continues to interrupt him with insults, and even makes a dig at the younger Stone (Will Greenberg) when he arrives. When the elder Stone reveals that his son has forced him out of the company and that he is now there strictly for his own <b>social</b> <b>benefit,</b> Clark takes the lead and makes the sale to the younger Stone. Both Dwight and Clark also buy a suit from the company to celebrate their team sale.|$|E

While ecosystem services are frequently represented by monetary values, social values and underlying <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> remain underexplored. The purpose of this study is to assess whether and how <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> have been explicitly addressed within socio-economic and socio-cultural ecosystem services research, ultimately allowing a better understanding between ecosystem services and human well-being. In this paper, we reviewed 115 international primary valuation studies and tested four hypotheses associated to the identification of <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> of ecosystem services using logistic regressions. Tested hypotheses were that (1) <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> are mostly derived in studies that assess cultural ecosystem services as opposed to other ecosystem service types, (2) there is a pattern of <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> and certain cultural ecosystem services assessed simultaneously, (3) monetary valuation techniques go beyond expressing monetary values and convey <b>social</b> <b>benefits,</b> and (4) directly addressing stakeholdeŕs views the consideration of <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> in ecosystem service assessments. Our analysis revealed that (1) a variety of <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> are valued in studies that assess either of the four ecosystem service types, (2) certain <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> are likely to co-occur in combination with certain cultural ecosystem services, (3) of the studies that employed monetary valuation techniques, simulated market approaches overlapped most frequently with the assessment of <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> and (4) studies that directly incorporate stakeholder's views were more likely to also assess <b>social</b> <b>benefits...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: While {{there are}} {{numerous}} studies on economic benefits of saltwater fishing, there is little literature on other <b>benefits</b> such as <b>social</b> <b>benefits.</b> It is widely accepted that leisure, and angling are associated with <b>social</b> <b>benefits,</b> family cohesion and friendship development, yet few empirical studies exist to support these claims. Additional research that examines the relationship between recreation and leisure activities (e. g. saltwater fishing) and <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> {{is needed to determine}} if such a relationship exists. The purpose of this project is to present the findings of a study done to determine the <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> of saltwater fishing. Data was collected by interviewing fishermen along North Carolina beaches participating in surf fishing, charter boat fishing, and pier fishing. Discussion focuses on the extent that <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> received through saltwater fishing compare to other recreational activities, to what extent is involvement in saltwater angling related to <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> received, and the relationship between participation frequency in saltwater fishing and <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> received...|$|R

25|$|Of great {{importance}} {{in the theory of}} marginal cost is the distinction between the marginal private and social costs. The marginal private cost shows the cost associated to the firm in question. It is the marginal private cost that is used by business decision makers in their profit maximization goals. Marginal social cost is similar to private cost in that it includes the cost of private enterprise but also any other cost (or offsetting benefit) to society to parties having no direct association with purchase or sale of the product. It incorporates all negative and positive externalities, of both production and consumption. Examples might include a social cost from air pollution affecting third parties or a <b>social</b> <b>benefit</b> from flu shots protecting others from infection.|$|E
25|$|Social {{motivation}} {{is tied to}} one's activity in a group. It cannot form from a single mind alone. For example, bowling alone is naught but the dull act of throwing a ball into pins, and so people are {{much less likely to}} smile during the activity alone, even upon getting a strike because their satisfaction or dissatisfaction {{does not need to be}} communicated, and so it is internalized. However, when with a group, people are more inclined to smile regardless of their results because it acts as a positive communication that is beneficial for pleasurable interaction and teamwork. Thus the act of bowling becomes a social activity as opposed to a dull action because it becomes an exercise in interaction, competition, team building, and sportsmanship. It is because of this phenomenon that studies have shown that people are more intrigued in performing mundane activities so long as there is company because it provides the opportunity to interact in one way or another, be it for bonding, amusement, collaboration, or alternative perspectives. Examples of activities that may one may not be motivated to do alone but could be done with others for <b>social</b> <b>benefit</b> are things such as throwing and catching a baseball with a friend, making funny faces with children, building a treehouse, and performing a debate.|$|E
