5000|$|A second common {{confusion}} about screen gain arises for grey colored screens. If a <b>screen</b> <b>material</b> looks grey on casual examination then its total reflectance {{is much less}} than 1. However, the grey screen can have measured gain of 1 or even much greater than 1. The geometric behavior of a grey screen {{is different from that}} of a white screen of identical gain. Therefore, since geometry is important in screen applications, screen materials should be at least specified by their gain and their total reflectance. Instead of total reflectance, [...] "geometric gain" [...] (equal to the gain divided by the total reflectance) can be the second specification.|$|E

50|$|A major advance over rear {{projection}} is front projection, {{which uses a}} special <b>screen</b> <b>material</b> to allow the plate to be projected {{from the front of}} the screen. This results in a much sharper and more saturated image. Although the technique had been used experimentally for some time, it was during the filming of 2001: A Space Odyssey that the modern version was fully developed. In this case it was used to avoid costly on-location shots in Africa during the opening scenes of the movie, but the effect was also used throughout the film for a variety of shots into or out of the windows of spacecraft. 2001 also used {{rear projection}} to produce computer screen effects.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} curriculum, the Theatre dept. offers {{hands-on}} performance {{experience in a}} variety of dramatic styles and periods, ranging from Classical Greek to Shakespeare, Commedia dell'arte and contemporary American writing, including on-camera work and <b>screen</b> <b>material.</b> Moreover, students are offered the necessary training to support the demands of heightened language and stylized material, preparing them for auditions at the collegiate level. Perhaps most importantly, students benefit from the opportunity to rehearse and perform material that is unavailable in a typical secondary school setting, not to mention the local area. Productions of note include 'Heathen Valley,' 'The Wrestling Season,' 'The Cripple of Inishmaan,' 'The Laramie Project,' and original student work focused on contemporary issues and civil rights.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} sizing {{process is}} screening, or passing the particles to be sized through a screen or number of screens. Screening equipment can include grizzlies, bar screens, wedge wire screens, radial sieves, banana screens, multi-deck screens, vibratory screen, fine screens, flip flop screens and wire mesh screens. Screens can be static (typically {{the case for}} very coarse material), or they can incorporate mechanisms to shake or vibrate the screen. Some considerations in this process include the <b>screen</b> <b>material,</b> the aperture size, shape and orientation, the amount of near sized particles, the addition of water, the amplitude and frequency of the vibrations, the angle of inclination, the presence of harmful materials, like steel and wood, and the size distribution of the particles.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the effect of}} solar {{radiation}} distribution in a typical screenhouse was numerically investigated, {{taking into account the}} thickness and aerodynamic properties of the screen and its spectral, optical and thermal properties. A two dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was used to render the building's geometry, and the Discrete Ordinates (DO) model to simulate the radiation transmission through the screen, taking into account its spectral distribution in three wavelength bands. The results show the influence of the properties of <b>screen</b> <b>materials</b> on the distribution of solar radiation, air velocity and air temperature inside the screenhouse. Decreasing screen porosity resulted in an increase of air temperature and in a decrease of air velocity under the screenhouse. In higher screen porosities, the flow was dominated by buoyancy effects, showing the importance of internal temperature gradients. <b>Screening</b> <b>materials</b> with high absorbance reduce internal solar radiation and air temperature and lead to the development of secondary recirculation where the air is trapped. © ISHS 2012...|$|R

50|$|New York {{became the}} first state to take {{advantage}} of the Supreme Court's decision by instituting a censorship board in 1921. Virginia followed suit the following year, with eight individual states having a board by the advent of sound film, but many of these were ineffectual. By the 1920s, the New York stage — a frequent source of subsequent <b>screen</b> <b>material</b> — had topless shows, performances filled with curse words, mature subject matters, and sexually suggestive dialogue. Early in the sound system conversion process, it became apparent that what might be acceptable in New York would not be so in Kansas. Moviemakers were looking at the possibility that many states and cities would adopt their own codes of censorship, requiring a multiplicity of versions of movies made for national distribution. Self-censorship seemed a preferable outcome.|$|E
50|$|Security screen doors add {{a second}} set of hinges or locks to defeat before access to a {{structure}} can be granted. If the intention is to keep thieves out, or keep disturbed individuals in, this is a better solution. Security screen doors also make it possible to open the main door, and communicate with those outside. Some even have mail slots. As an added benefit, security screen doors can allow the door to be opened, and provide for secure ventilation. The main downside is the cost, which is generally about as much as a regular door, and locks are usually sold separately. Installation can also be difficult, as the doorknobs of the two doors may interfere with each other, and the <b>screen</b> <b>material</b> usually interferes with any peephole devices on the door.|$|E

50|$|Transportable semi-mobile {{installations}} {{have gained}} increasing {{popularity in the}} last two decades. They are enabled by the fact that complete sensor-based sorting systems are relatively compact in relation to the capacity in tonnes per hour. This is mainly because little infrastructure is needed. The picture shows a containerised sensor-based sorter which is applied in Chromitite sorting. The system is operated in conjunction with a Diesel-powered mobile crusher and <b>screen.</b> <b>Material</b> handling of the feed, undersize fraction, product and waste fraction is conducted using a wheel loader. The system is powered by a Diesel generator and a compressor station delivers the instrument quality air needed for the operation.Semi-mobile installations are applied primarily to minimise material handling and save transport costs. Another reason for choosing the semi-mobile option for an installation is bulk testing of new ore bodies.Capacity of a system very much depends on the size fraction sorted, but a 250tph capacity is a good estimate for semi-mobile installations, considering a capacity of 125tph sorter feed and 125tph undersize material.During the last decade both generic plant designs and customised designs have been developed, for example in the framework of the i2mine project.|$|E
5000|$|Two Sandvik hybrid rolls crushers {{perform the}} primary and {{secondary}} crushing duties at gaps of approximately 60 and 40 mm respectively. These crushers were preferred over jaw crushers as they should cope better with the high clay content of the ore {{in the early years}} of operation. The secondary crusher product is conveyed into a Sepro scrubber where the material is washed to remove fines sticking to the coarser material. The majority of material from the scrubber reports to a double-deck screen, sizing at 9 and 4 mm. Oversize material (>9 mm) material from the scrubber and this screen is conveyed to two Sandvik cone crushers with a closed size setting of 12 - 15 mm, before returning onto the scrubber <b>screen.</b> <b>Material</b> between 9 and 4 mm in size reports to the DMS circuit. The undersize from the scrubber screen (<4 mm) is pumped onto a second screen where it is sized at 0.5 mm. The oversize for this screen makes up further DMS feed, and the undersize from this screen (< 0.5mm) reports to a large holding tank that stores feed for the gravity circuit.|$|E
5000|$|Tahir Shah is a {{prolific}} author of books, documentaries, book introductions, peer reviewed academic articles, and book reviews. The {{vast majority of}} Shah's books can be considered travel literature, {{with the exception of}} his 2012 release Timbuctoo. Shah's first published book was Cultural Research, written for the London-based Institute for Cultural Research. One of his more notable works is Trail of Feathers, an account of his trip through Peru, Machu Picchu, the Incas and Cusco. Another book, In Search of King Solomon's Mines, searching for undiscovered mines known only in folklore. Other books like in Arabian Nights and Travels with Myself are mostly about the author's journeys through exotic locations. His first traditional travelogue was in 1995 with Beyond the Devil's Teeth, covering a trip through Africa, India and much of Latin America. [...] Shah has written book reviews for The Washington Post, The Guardian, and The Spectator. As well as writing and film making, Shah writes <b>screen</b> <b>material</b> and co-wrote Journey to Mecca, an IMAX film charting the first journey made by Ibn Battuta to Mecca for the Hajj, in 1325.

50|$|Semi-specular {{high gain}} <b>screen</b> <b>materials</b> are suited to ceiling-mounted {{projector}} setups since the greatest {{intensity of light}} will be reflected downward toward the audience at an angle equal and opposite to the angle of incidence. However, for a viewer seated {{to one side of}} the audience the opposite side of the screen is much darkened for the same reason. Some structured <b>screen</b> <b>materials</b> are semi-specularly reflective in the vertical plane while more perfectly diffusely reflective in the horizontal plane to avoid this. Glass-bead screens exhibit a phenomenon of retroreflection; the light is reflected more intensely back to its source than in any other direction. They work best for setups where the image source is placed in the same direction from the screen as the audience. With retroreflective screens, the screen center might be brighter than the screen periphery, a kind of hot spotting. This differs from semi-specular screens where the hot spot's location varies depending on the viewer's position in the audience. Retroreflective screens are seen as desirable due to the high image intensity they can produce with a given luminous flux from a projector.|$|R
