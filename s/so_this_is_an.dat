500|$|St Helen's Church has {{a maximum}} length of [...] and is aligned at 25° north of east. The {{majority}} of English churches have an alignment {{within a few}} degrees of east, <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> exceptionally large deviation from the norm. The sandstone church has a large, mainly 15th-century west tower supported by corner buttresses and topped with battlements and pinnacles. The tower has a four-light window and west doorway, and contains a spiral stairway to the bell and clock chambers and the roof. The chancel is adjoined by the former north chapel (now the vestry) {{on one side and}} the Hastings Chapel, set transept-wise on the other; it has three sedilia and a piscina on its northern wall. The nave is significantly wider than it is long, and has four bays with medieval inner north and south aisles and 19th-century outer aisles. The Hastings Chapel, chancel and clerestory are embattled, and the former north chapel is English Perpendicular, with a window of the same style. The piers in the nave were remodelled in the 15th century, and have incised panels, as do some of the arches. This feature is of an unusual style and is also seen at Sherborne Abbey in Dorset and at St Peter and St Paul, Syston, Leicestershire.|$|E

These are generally Christians, and then their cardinal text is the instruction to [...] "turn the other cheek." [...] Often they are Quakers.
