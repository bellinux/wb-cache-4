40|$|Cavitation erosion {{tests were}} carried out for Ti-Ni shape memory alloy solid and coating using {{stationary}} specimen method of vibratory apparatus. The alloy coating was made by sputter deposition and was heat-treated at 300, 500 and 700 ℃. The coatings without heat treatment and with treatment at 300 ℃ were completely peeled off after reaching the substrate due to cavitation, and the coatings heated at 500 and 700 ℃ were strong enough to have high resistance of the erosion. A transition of mass loss rate was observed against the temperature of heat treatment. The mass loss rate changes from high to low at 40 O℃, because of the crystallization at this temperature. The mass loss rate of the coatings heat treated at 500 and 700 ℃ corresponds well {{with that of the}} alloy solid. It was concluded that the erosion resistance in Ti-Ni shape memory alloy coating is about 20 times superior to that of <b>stelite</b> 6 B...|$|E
