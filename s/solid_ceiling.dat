The enclosure is differentially heated from vertical walls, and horizontal walls are adiabatic. Finite difference method is employed to solve the set of governing equations. The dimensionless governing parameters for computations are: Rayleigh number (from 103 to 106), dimensionless ceiling wall thickness (0. 05 and 0. 5) and thermal conductivity ratio (from 1 to 100).

40|$|Solitary {{dilation}} {{waves and}} self-sustained oscillations ("optical " mode) are {{observed in a}} one dimensional pattern of liquid columns produced in the pouring of a liquid film from a <b>solid</b> <b>ceiling.</b> A new experiment carried out on a circular fountain allows us to achieve periodic boundary conditions, and thus to observe free propagation of the dilation waves in an infinite medium. Measurements of the drift and group velocities of the dilation waves, and of the "optical " pulsation, are presented as functions of the flow rate. In addition, starting from qualitative observations and order of magnitude stimates, we build a discrete model of non-linear dynamics in this system in which dissipation is compensated by an external energy supply (transient drop formation). This model allows us to recover {{the appearance of the}} "optical mode " induced by a wavelength increase and predicts the "focusing " of this mode into a localized "kink " traveling at a constant speed along the column array. The kink structure is reminiscent of the "dilation " waves observed experimentally. Both the model and experiment support a relationship between the wave velocity and the oscillation frequency similar to that observed by Michalland and Rabaud in the "printer's instability".

50|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} was entrusted to the Florentine Giuliano da Maiano. The facade closely parallels the Palazzo Medici Riccardi of Florence built a few decades prior. The sober facade, of smooth stone, has three stories, with mullioned windows with round arches on the second floor. Unlike earlier Gothic palaces, which often afforded transient wooden scafolds for either balconies or awnings, this palace has a <b>solid</b> protruding <b>ceiling</b> cornice near the roofline with classical busts putatively of Roman emperors. The interior courtyard had a scenic stairwell leading to second floor.|$|R
50|$|The {{ceiling is}} {{supported}} by rows of stone pillars from whose capitals hang elegant chains carved out of <b>solid</b> stone. The <b>ceiling</b> {{in front of the}} main shrine is covered by a block of stone seven feet in diameter carved in the shape of an inverted open lotus with parrots. This carving is surrounded by the Gatti Mudhali insignia. The outer walls of the inner most sanctum are covered with inscriptions.|$|R

FLEXWAL predicts {{upper and lower}} wall {{modifications}} necessary to remove wall-interference effects in adaptive-wall wind tunnels. FLEXWAL aids in elimination of wall-interference effects on objects tested in typical two-dimensional wind tunnel with rigid sidewalls and flexible, <b>solid</b> floor and <b>ceiling</b> boundaries. Iterative procedure valid for subsonic and transonic test conditions, and convergence of method verified both analytically and experimentally. FLEXWAL written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution...|$|R
40|$|The {{transient}} behaviour of plane fountains with a uniform inlet velocity, injected upwards into a quiescent homogeneous fluid of lower density to impinge on a solid flat ceiling, is investigated. The Reynolds number, the Froude {{number and the}} Prandtl number of these impinging fountains have the values in the ranges of 50 6 Re 6 1000; 8 6 Fr 6 20 and 7 6 Pr 6 700, and {{the height of the}} <b>solid</b> <b>ceiling</b> away from the fountain source is varied in the range of 10 Xin 6 H 6 30 Xin, where Xin is the half-width of the planar fountain source slot. A scaling is found by dimensional analysis for the augmented spreading distance (H þ Xd, where Xd is the spreading distance of the impinging fountain), which shows that ðH þ XdÞ=Xin Fr 43 23 ðcþgþ 2 /ÞReðcþgÞPrgðH=XinÞ/, where the powers c; g and / can be determined empirically. The direct numerical simulation results show that after the fountain impinges upwards on the ceiling it spreads outwards along the ceiling until gravity forces it to fall. Two different scenarios are identified. In the first scenario, a nearly constant measurable spreading distance is obtained at full development. In the second scenario, however, the fountain floods the whole computational domain and no spreading distance exists at full development. The numerical results further show that in the first scenario the augmented spreading distance (H þ Xd) has the reduced scaling of ðH þ XdÞ=Xin Fr 2 = 3 ðH=XinÞ 1 = 2 for the plane impinging fountains with the parameter values in the ranges of 50 6 Re < 125; 8 6 Fr 6 20 and 7 6 Pr 6 700...|$|E

The objectives of this project are to create a portable, versatile and ergonomic ceiling fan blade cleaner and to create equipment that easy to operate. Sponge and plastic material were studied in this thesis which commonly used in industry. The structural three-dimensional <b>solid</b> modelling of <b>ceiling</b> fan cleaner was developed using the solid work software. The acquired result present both of ceiling fan blades surface is cleaned when used sponge. The dust and cobwebs from blade is free {{to fall into the}} dust-box. The durability assessment results are significant to improve the component design at the early developing stage. The results can also significantly reduce the cost and time to market, and improve product reliability and customer confidence...|$|R
60|$|We were to dine at the Refectory of the House {{with the}} new member for Boston; and, meanwhile, Bennoch {{obtained}} admittance for us into the Speaker's gallery, where we had {{a view of the}} members, and could hear what was going on. A Mr. Muntz was speaking on the Income Tax, and he was followed by Sir George Cornewall Lewis and others; but it was all very uninteresting, without the slightest animation or attempt at oratory,--which, indeed, would have been quite out of place. We saw Lord Palmerston; but at too great a distance to distinguish anything but a gray head. The House had daylight in it when we entered, and for some time afterwards; but, by and by, the roof, which I had taken to be a <b>solid</b> and opaque <b>ceiling,</b> suddenly brightened, and showed itself to be transparent; a vast expanse of tinted and figured glass, through which came down a great, mild radiance on the members below.|$|R
50|$|A {{ceiling balloon}} is a small, usually red, (fluted) rubber balloon {{commonly}} measuring 76 mm (3 in) across prior to inflation, inflated to ~40 cm diameter. After inflation the balloon is taken outside and released. By timing the balloon from release until {{it enters the}} cloud a ceiling height can be obtained. When correctly inflated the balloon will rise at rate of 140 m/min (460 ft/min). The bases of clouds are very rarely flat and <b>solid,</b> so the <b>ceiling</b> height is not when the balloon disappears but when the colour begins to fade. The balloon {{can also be used}} to measure the vertical visibility into a layer of fog or blowing snow. In this case the balloon will begin to fade as soon as it is released, so the vertical visibility is when the balloon disappears. If the balloon is visible for a considerable distance into the cloud layer the observer should make note of it as it is of importance to aircraft.|$|R
40|$|A jet of {{cold air}} is denser then ambient air but it adheres to {{the ceiling of the}} room over the given {{distance}} when it is blown horizontally close to it. Such behaviour of fluid jets is well-known as Coanda effect and it is widely used in practice like in the case of ventilation and air-conditioning of rooms. This phenomenon is not sufficiently known both in terms of mechanism and quantitative effects. The complexity is arising in the case of non-adiabatic ceiling that is common practice in real building structures, since the cold air jet, attachment distance is strongly influenced by heat flux thought the ceiling. The aim {{of this paper is to}} propose an algorithm of numerical simulation of fluid flow and heat transfer in the room and ceiling simultaneously, known as conjugate heat transfer problem. Using proposed model, uncertainty of heat transfer coefficient determination is avoided integrating the same general transport equation for fluid flow and heat transfer over the whole computational domain including both air movements in the room and <b>ceiling</b> <b>solids...</b>|$|R
40|$|This book by {{architectural}} historian Grant Hildebrand is {{a search}} for the special quality that makes Frank Lloyd Wright 2 ̆ 7 s houses so well liked, both by their owners and general public. Hildebrand calls this special quality a 2 ̆ 2 pattern 2 ̆ 2 -that is, a repetitive configuration of architectural elements that, although uniquely expressed in each house, is an underlying motif in all of them. Hildebrand believes that this pattern involves the spatial dialectic of inside and outside as expressed through repeated architectural parts-the entry, the fireplace, <b>ceilings,</b> <b>solid</b> and windowed walls, terraces, and openings from the house to the outside, especially immediate spaces. Hildebrand 2 ̆ 7 s aim is to establish the experienced qualities of this inside-outside motif as it is expressed architecturally. 2 ̆ 2 I want to examine, 2 ̆ 2 he declares, 2 ̆ 2 correspondences between Wright 2 ̆ 7 s pattern and the characteristics that we now believe human beings, preconditioned by nature, select in their habitations 2 ̆ 2 (p. 28) ...|$|R
