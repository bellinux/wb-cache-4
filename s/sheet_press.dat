5000|$|The early {{peanut butter}} cookies were rolled thin {{and cut into}} shapes. They were also dropped and made into balls. They did not have fork marks. The first {{reference}} to the famous criss-cross marks created with fork tines {{was published in the}} Schenectady Gazette on July 1, 1932. The Peanut Butter Cookies recipe said [...] "Shape into balls and after placing them on the cookie <b>sheet,</b> <b>press</b> each one down with a fork, first one way and then the other, so they look like squares on waffles." [...] Pillsbury, one of the large flour producers, popularized the use of the fork in the 1930s. The Peanut Butter Balls recipe in the 1933 edition of Pillsbury's Balanced Recipes instructed the cook to press the cookies using fork tines. The 1932 or 1933 recipes do not explain why this advice is given, though: peanut butter cookie dough is dense, and without being pressed, it will not cook evenly. Using a fork to press the dough is a convenience; bakers can also use a cookie shovel.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1980s, {{the small}} and {{lightweight}} HP 7470 introduced the [...] "grit wheel" [...] mechanism, {{eliminating the need for}} perforations along the edges, unlike the Calcomp plotters two decades earlier. The grit wheels at opposite edges of the <b>sheet</b> <b>press</b> against resilient polyurethane-coated rollers and form tiny indentations in the sheet. As the sheet is moved back and forth, the grit wheels keep the sheet in proper registration due to the grit particles falling into the earlier indentations, much like the teeth of two gears meshing. The pen is mounted on a carriage that moves back and forth in a line between the grit wheels, representing the orthogonal axis. These smaller [...] "home-use" [...] plotters became popular for desktop business graphics and in engineering laboratories, but their low speed meant they were not useful for general printing purposes, and different conventional printer would be required for those jobs. One category, introduced by Hewlett Packard's MultiPlot for the HP 2647, was the [...] "word chart", which used the plotter to draw large letters on a transparency. This was the forerunner of the modern Powerpoint chart. With the widespread availability of high-resolution inkjet and laser printers, inexpensive memory and computers fast enough to rasterize color images, pen plotters have all but disappeared. However, the grit wheel mechanism is still found in inkjet-based, large format engineering plotters.|$|E
40|$|Press {{hardening}} {{is currently}} {{used in the}} production of automotive structures that require very high strength and controlled deformation during crash tests. Press hardening can achieve significant reductions of sheet thickness at constant strength and is therefore a promising technology for the production of lightweight and energy-efficient automobiles. The manganeseboron steel 22 MnB 5 have been implemented in <b>sheet</b> <b>press</b> hardening owing to their excellent hot formability, high hardenability, and good temperability even at low cooling rates. However, press-hardened components have shown poor ductility and cracking at relatively small strains. A possible solution to this problem is a selective increase of steel sheet ductility by press hardening process design in areas where the component is required to deform plastically during crash tests. To this end, process designers require information about microstructure and mechanical properties {{as a function of the}} wide spectrum of cooling rates and sequences and austenitizing treatment conditions that can be encountered in production environments. In the present work, a Continuous Cooling Transformation (CCT) diagram with corresponding material properties of sheet steel 22 MnB 5 was determined for a wide spectrum of cooling rates. Heating and cooling programs were conducted in a quenching dilatometer. Motivated by the importance of residual elasticity in crash test performance, this property was measured using a micro-bending test and the results were integrated into the CCT diagrams to complement the hardness testing results. This information is essential for the process design of press hardening of sheet components with gradient material properties...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Color {{matching}} between proofs and <b>press</b> <b>sheets</b> has {{not been}} a trivial task. Differences in colorants, solid ink density, and dot gain between hard copy output devices are some of the reasons that proofs and <b>press</b> <b>sheets</b> don’t match. The Inter-national Color Consortium (ICC) has developed a system-level color management tool which is aimed at improving color rendering between various imaging devices. In this paper, the ICC-based color matching experiments were performed {{with the use of a}} four-color sheet-fed offset press, a film-based color proofer, and a thermal dye transfer process. Specifically, we investigated if ICC-based CMS can help an analog color proofer and a continuous-tone digital color proofer improve its color matching to a reference <b>press</b> <b>sheet.</b> Experimental findings based on observer analysis using rank ordering, and colorimetric analysis between proofs and <b>press</b> <b>sheets</b> were discussed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} method of using {{reflection}} density readings taken with a conventional graphic arts densitometer to provide a numeric measure of the visual difference between a sample <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> and a reference sheet. This numerical measure was developed based {{on the theory that}} human response to variation in process color printing is more affected by changes in the proportions of process inks to each other than by variation in the overall inking level of the <b>press</b> <b>sheet.</b> The thesis then goes on to explain how the proposed system was tested. First, a set of color samples was generated. Observer evaluations of these color samples were converted to numeric values using psychometric evaluation methods. Using statistical methods, observer evaluations in numeric form were then tested against values obtained by using the proposed system. Observer evaluations of the color samples were also compared statistically with values from the Total Color Difference system as an additional test. The thesis concludes that the proposed system is a reliable predictor of observer response to color variation when the system is used for the purpose of comparing reference <b>press</b> <b>sheets</b> to sample <b>press</b> <b>sheets...</b>|$|R

40|$|Contract {{proofing}} {{for printing}} has been traditionally done by press proofing. This is costly and wasteful, {{not just in}} terms of equipment and labor but also in terms of expendables. The advent of off-press proofing was greeted with some degree of uncertainty by the printing industry. With press proofing, the proof was literally a preview of what would happen on a press. The press proof, although often printed on a different press, generally used the same type of inks, plates and substrate that would characterize the final print. With offpress proofing, printers were comparing apples to oranges; instead of comparing a <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> to a <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> they were comparing a <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> to an approximation of a <b>press</b> <b>sheet.</b> However, over time as printers learned to read off-press proofs, they became accepted as contract proofs. The same situation has now befallen digital proofs. In the particular case of flexography, the proofing problem is a bit different. Off-press analog proofs were designed with lithography in mind, they were characterized to simulate lithographic dot gain. In order to make a proof that looks like a flexographic <b>press</b> <b>sheet,</b> two sets of films are required; one which compensates for flexographic dot gain (this is the set from which the job would be printed) and one which has extra dot gain built into the highlight and quarter- tones (this is the set that the proof would be made from). This extra set of films is wasteful and time consuming to generate. Digital proofing seems to be well suited for flexography, because the dot gain can be built into the proofing system and no extra film is required to create the proof. At the most basic level {{there are two types of}} digital proofers available; those which simulate halftone dots and those that do not. Whether or not the dots are necessary is open to discussion, however, in the case of flexography the dots appear to be crucial. For this research document it was decided that the halftone dots were preferred. The reason for this is that at about 133 lpi the rosette patterns formed by halftone dots are at the threshold of resolution by the human eye. For more course screen rulings this is even more critical. Much of flexography is printed at screen rulings of 133 lpi or lower, so very often the dots can be resolved by the eye. Therefore, the mindset at the beginning of the research was that if the dots can be resolved on the <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> then the dots should be resolved on the proof. The major thrust of this research was to observe whether or not a halftone-based digital proofer can simulate the appearance of a flexographic <b>press</b> <b>sheet.</b> A flexographic test form was created and printed on a film based substrate. A <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> was sent to two vendors who manufacture halftone proofers. The proofing systems are not mentioned by name; they are instead referred to as Digital Proof A and B. They then attempted to match the <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> as closely as possible. Thus, through reverse engineering, the vendors created a device profile for this set of printing conditions. Upon receipt of the proofs, they were compared to the <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> in terms of optical density, hue (AE) and halftone dot size. Later, a visual assessment was executed to observe how closely the digital proofs matched the <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> using a 3 M Matchprint, that had been altered to approximate flexography, as the reference or control proof. The results showed that there were significant differences between proof and <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> in some instances and insignificant differences in others. In terms of the physical structure of the halftone dots, the 3 M Matchprint had the closest match to the <b>press</b> <b>sheet</b> dot structure. In terms of physical dot size; digital proof A best matched the 50 and 75 % dots and the Matchprint matched the 5 % dots the best. In terms of optical density; digital proof A best matched the density of the 25 % dots, digital proof B best matched the density of the 5 % dots and the Matchprint best matched the 50 and 75 % dot patches. In terms of AE values (color or hue difference); the Matchprint most closely matched the <b>press</b> <b>sheet,</b> digital proof B was next, and digital proof A was last. In terms of a visual match, the three proofs were found to be statistically equal in their ability to visually match the <b>press</b> <b>sheet.</b> The visual match being the most powerful of the criteria; shows that the measurable differences in the proofs did not directly affect their ability to match the <b>press</b> <b>sheet.</b> The results show that either of the two halftone digital proofs could have been used in place of the 3 M Matchprint. The results also question the need for halftone dots in a proof. This is primarily because the two halftone digital proofs utilized a different RIP than the Agfa generated films for the 3 M Matchprint and flexographic <b>press</b> <b>sheet.</b> Yet the visual observations made by the judges could not, at a normal viewing distance, discern this difference. The conclusion is that there is no visual difference between the halftone digital proofs and the 3 M Matchprint proof in terms of visually matching the <b>press</b> <b>sheet...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of making bioplastics out of oil cake from Crambe Abyssinica, Brassica Carinata and Brassica Napus (Rapeseed) was studied {{in order to}} produce added value for these by-products. The materials were hot pressed and extruded at 100 ˚C using glycerol as a plasticizer. Pressing without plasticizer produced brittle materials. Tensile properties, moisture content, water and oil absorption were determined for the hot <b>pressed</b> <b>sheets.</b> Ball milling of the oil cake did not result in improved properties of the <b>pressed</b> <b>sheets.</b> As the three plants all have semi-drying oils, a siccative was added in different concentrations to crosslink the oil and add to the matrix of the bioplastic. <b>Sheets</b> were <b>pressed</b> after preheating the materials 0 h, 2 h or 6 h. <b>Sheets</b> were also <b>pressed</b> from granulated extrudate with different concentrations of siccative after pre-heating for 0 h or 2 h. Tensile properties, moisture content, water and oil absorption were determined for the <b>pressed</b> <b>sheets.</b> Pre-heating before pressing had a larger impact than siccative concentration on the properties of crambe and carinata sheets. Siccative concentration had larger influences on the properties of rapeseed cake sheets. Carinata and rapeseed cake were easier to process than crambe as they flowed better. Carinata sheets and extrudates were more flexible than crambe and rapeseed cake sheets and extrudates. A tray could be pressed from a mixture of crambe and rapeseed cake.
