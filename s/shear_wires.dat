5000|$|The Type 93 {{mine was}} a {{circular}} Japanese landmine {{used during the}} Second World War. It entered service in 1933. It used a simple fuze with a variable activation pressure, achieved {{through the use of}} different thickness <b>shear</b> <b>wires.</b> The main charge could be supplemented with additional explosives buried under the mine.|$|E
5000|$|The ship {{proceeded}} in a {{sharp turn}} to approach for its landing. That generates extremely high tension in the after part of the ship, {{and especially in the}} center sections close to the stabilizing fins which are braced by <b>shear</b> <b>wires.</b> I can imagine that one of these <b>shear</b> <b>wires</b> parted and caused a rent in a gas cell. If we will assume this further, then what happened subsequently can be fitted in to what observers have testified to here: Gas escaped from the torn cell upwards and filled up the space between the outer cover and the cells in the rear part of the ship, and then this quantity of gas which we have assumed in the hypothesis was ignited by a static spark.Under these conditions, naturally, the gas accumulated between the gas cells and the outer cover must have been a very rich gas. That means it was not an explosive mixture of hydrogen, but more of a pure hydrogen. The loss of gas must have been appreciable.I would like to insert here, because the necessary trimming moments to keep the ship on an even keel were appreciable, and everything apparently happened in the last five or six minutes, that is, during the sharp turn preceding the landing maneuver, that therefore {{there must have been a}} rich gas mixture up there, or possibly pure gas, and such gas does not burn in the form of an explosion. It burns off slowly, particularly because it was in an enclosed space between outer cover and gas cells, and only in the moment when gas cells are burned by the burning off of this gas, then the gas escapes in greater volume, and then the explosions can occur, which have been reported to us at a later stage of the accident by so many witnesses.The rest it is not necessary for me to explain, and in conclusion, I would like to state this appears to me to be a possible explanation, based on weighing all of the testimony that I have heard so far.|$|E

50|$|The 70mm rocket, {{like the}} 20 cm model, used a mortar fuze. There {{would be no}} set back when the rocket was fired to arm an {{artillery}} fuze. The Japanese mortar fuse for the 81mm and 90mm used a <b>shear</b> <b>wire</b> to make it bore safe. The wire went through the brass body and aluminum firing pin plunger.

5000|$|After {{the tape}} {{detached}} during flight, the hammer was prevented from being forced inward by air resistance {{by a thin}} [...] "shearing wire" [...] passing through the hammer spindle, which was easily broken by the hammer encountering any physical resistance. The spindle was prevented from rotating relative to the fuze body in flight, and hence from snapping the <b>shearing</b> <b>wire,</b> by a guide pin passing through a cutout in the spindle.|$|R
50|$|The {{first account}} of a {{percussion}} fuze appears in 1650, using a flint to create sparks to ignite the powder. The {{problem was that the}} shell had to fall a particular way and with spherical shells this could not be guaranteed. The term ‘blind’ for an unexploded shell resulted. The problem was finding a suitably stable ‘percussion powder’. Progress was not possible until the discovery of mercury fulminate in 1800, leading to priming mixtures for small arms patented by the Rev Alexander Forsyth, and the copper percussion cap in 1818. The concept of percussion fuzes was adopted by Britain in 1842, many designs were jointly examined by the army and navy, but were unsatisfactory, probably because of the safety & arming features. However, in 1846 the design by Quartermaster Freeburn of the Royal Artillery was adopted by the army.

50|$|The second Japanese {{anti-tank}} grenade - {{a suicide}} weapon - was nicknamed the 'lunge mine'. This weapon {{was a very}} large HEAT warhead on a five-foot stick. The soldier rammed it forward into the tank or other target, which broke a <b>shear</b> <b>wire</b> that allowed a strike pin to impact a primer and detonate the large HEAT warhead - destroying both soldier and target.

The mine uses the Shear-pin based Contact Mine Fuze No.3 Mk I. The fuze consists simply of a spring-loaded striker pin restrained by a shear pin.

40|$|Abstract. For known {{well the}} {{contributions}} of both tension-compression-ratio of material and intermediate principal <b>shear</b> stress to <b>wire</b> forming, the wire forming problem is developed based on unified strength theory. By denoting a notation of D, the unified stresses solution for wire forming is gained, which is suitable to both wire drawing and extrusion. In addition, when material has identical strength in tension and compression, the stresses solution based on unified strength theory become that based on unified yield criterion. Notably, it is proved that the stresses of wire forming are independent of the intermediate principal shear stress. Whether any yield criterion (e. g., Mises, Tresca or unified yield criterion) is adopted, for {{it is assumed that}} the tensile and compressive strength is equal to one another, the stresses solution is as same as that based on unified yield criterion, and is merely a special case of the unified stresses solution developed by this paper...|$|R
40|$|Professor Slatta {{has written}} a solid social history of the Argentine {{countryside}} in the nineteenth century. Not only does he describe and analyze the life-style of the gauchos-in itself, a formidable task-but he also outlines changes {{in the economy and}} in the political structure. Slatta 2 ̆ 7 s research is quite thorough. He avoids the tendency of many historians of Argentina to overlook primary sources, especially in the Archivo General de la Nacion. Moreover, the author has looked into provincial archives, particularly those at Tandil, and demonstrates a thorough knowledge of the relevant secondary sources. Handsomely produced and graced by attractive illustrations as well as convincing statistical data, Gauchos and the Vanishing Frontier is well organized. Slatta is a rigorous scholar, and his book is analytical rather than descriptive. Although the empirical foundations of the narrative are quite sound, it is not always a smooth read. Slatta knows how to turn a phrase, but he frequently repeats himself. Nevertheless, the book has a fine geographic context and will certainly be the definitive study of the gauchos as well as a major addition to Argentine history. Slatta supports the growing notion that nineteenth-century elites progressed {{at the expense of the}} masses and of indigenous cultures such as the gauchos. Vagrancy laws, conscription, and internal passports, and the introduction of technological changes (such as <b>shearing</b> machines, <b>wire</b> fences, and railroads) robbed the gaucho of his mobility. The elites considered the gauchos racially inferior and addicted to habits that impeded modernization and integration into the world economy. Therefore, Slatta argues, the oligarchy encouraged a massive wave of five million foreign immigrants to enter Argentina and displace the gauchos in the countryside. The author also notes that changes in rural life in the United States were somewhat similar, but land policies were not. Curiously enough, Slatta concludes by demonstrating that the oligarchs began championing the gaucho as the symbol of Argentine nationalism- a reaction to the prosperity and workingclass organization of the foreign immigrants. I concur with nearly all of Slatta 2 ̆ 7 s conclusions and appreciate his willingness to challenge other works that have recently appeared, particularly Jonathan Brown 2 ̆ 7 s study of the Argentine economy. Slatta shows that Argentine society was quite dependent upon the world economy once the elites strengthened their grip on the country. My major criticism would be a disappointment that the author did not say more about the gauchos of Paraguay and Brazil, particularly the much-studied province of Rio Grande do SuI. This region comprises two countries that are as gaucho as Argentina...|$|R
40|$|The {{monolithic}} structural {{action of}} various types of walls of flanged cross section and walls with engaged stiffeners or returns (nonrectangular sections) is critically dependent on the shear capacity of the interface between the components making up the section. An assessment of the shear capacity of the interface may also be required {{as part of the}} elastic or inelastic analysis of structural elements. Observation of past earthquake events has confirmed that effectively connected flanges also directly influence the seismic performance of nonrectangular sections by providing a more robust and seismically resistant structural element. To analyze the significance of the parameters that influence the vertical shear resistance of interfaces of flanged sections of masonry obtained using different types of bonding and bonding patterns (header units, <b>shear</b> connectors, and <b>wire</b> ties), a series of specimens with “H-shaped” cross sections was tested. The vertical shear capacity of the interface at the flange-web intersection was assessed in each case and compared to predicted code capacities. Considerable strength reserves and shear ductility were observed in almost all cases. Following the experimental study, a numerical investigation was carried out using a simplified micromodeling finite element approach. It showed that both the size of the specimen as well as the boundary and applied loading conditions on the flanges can significantly influence the observed vertical shear resistance of the interfaces of specimens with the same bonding pattern. Using the results of the numerical investigation, the critical parameters for a test to determine the vertical shear capacity of brick masonry nonrectangular cross sections are assessed and the governing parameters for a suitable shear test suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} {{evaluation}} of the static and dynamic behavior of cementitious sandwich panels with parallel steel <b>wire</b> <b>shear</b> connectors. The study is divided into two parts: (i) large-scale experimental evaluation of different structural sandwich members subjected to different types of loading regimes, and (ii) analytical procedures to predict the behavior of such panels. However, and {{due to the lack of}} experimental data on the behavior of such sandwich panels, the emphasis of this study is on full-scale experimental evaluation. In the analytical part of the study, modified procedures, based on the experimental observations, following the general guidelines of the American Concrete Institute (ACI 318 - 11) were adopted. Also, the experimental program focused on assessing the out-of-plane flexural behavior of floor/roof sandwich slabs. Both simply supported and two-span continuous large-scale floor/roof slabs, with different boundary conditions and details, were evaluated. The experimental results were compared to the analytical predictions and well agreement between the results was achieved. The study also included several large-scale element experiments that were conducted on walls subjected to axial, shear, eccentric and flexural loadings conditions as well as exterior and interior corner connections. These tests are considered to be a pioneering research work that are not available to-date in published literature. A summary of the test setup, test procedures and experimental results that included quasi-static and cyclic load-displacement (P-&# 948;) and Stress- Strain (&# 963;&# 8722;&# 949;) curves are presented and discussed herein. The comprehensive experimental program provided much needed information to the structural engineers that lack the knowledge on the service and ultimate performance of this type of sandwich structural elements. For example, the experimental results provided important information on the suitability of the sandwich panels with parallel wire connectors for the use as floors and roof slabs. In addition, the experimental results identified the different failure modes that are not similar to those for solid concrete elements. The simplified analytical procedures that followed, in general, the requirements of ACI 318 - 11 with justifiable modifications succeeded to provide conservative estimates to the capacity of each structural sandwich element evaluated in this study. Numerical design examples for typical residential buildings that were performed using the proposed analytical procedures are also presented. Conclusions drawn from this pioneering study is summarized and recommendations for future research work is presented in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue {{cracking}} in the inter-face {{between the}} heavy Al wire and the Al metallization {{of the power}} semiconductor {{is one of the}} major failure causes of power modules and discrete devices. These fatigue cracks are primarily caused by mismatch of the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of the Al of the bonding wire and the Si of the chip. During thermal cycling periodic plastic and elastic strains occur in the interface region weakening the wire material with every cycle. Typically this leads to the initiation and growth of cracks in the interface between the wire and the metallization. The final result is a bond lift off and a failure of the device. The main influencing factors for this degradation are the temperature swing and the maximum temperature of the cycle, the wire material and diameter and the initial wire bond quality. In the past, many publications in this field were concentrated on the reliability of complete power modules with many wire bonds. In these works the degradation process of a single wire was not monitored. Only the final result of the degradation - the bond wire lift off - was considered. To gain more insight into the degradation process in the interface between the wire bond and the chip metallization, crack initiation and growth has to be monitored on a single wire basis. Since electrical measurements of cracks lengths in the micrometer range are not feasible and common inspection methods such as X-Ray and Acoustic Microscopes do not deliver high enough spatial resolution only metallographic cross sectioning followed by SEM or light microscope inspection can reveal the correct crack length and possibly the grain structure around the crack tip. Metallographic cross sectioning is a manual step and thus very time consuming. It is feasible only for a small number of samples but on a power semiconductor many wires (up to 20) are bonded in parallel to increase current capability and reliability of the module. In this case, cross sectioning of every wire is not possible. Typically the interface quality of heavy wire bonds right after the bonding process is evaluated by the shear test. During the shear test, a shear tool is <b>shearing</b> through the <b>wire</b> material at a defined height above the pad metallization. The measured shear force and the coverage of the sheared bond site with wire material give a clue about the bonding quality. If during thermal cycling a crack is initiated and growing this must be detectable by decreasing shear forces and coverage of the shear site. For this reason the shear test is used for detecting the crack growth. In this poster shear results after power cycling with different temperature swings and maximum temperatures are presented. In addition, cross sections and microstructure analyses reveal that the exact path of the crack is not directly in the interface between wire and metallization but in a layer above the interface. This layer is characterized by fine grains below and coarse grains above. Also, the analysis of the crack tip area shows mainly intercrystalline crack growth...|$|R
