5|$|Statistical {{rating systems}} give Steinitz a rather low ranking among world champions, mainly because he took <b>several</b> <b>long</b> breaks from {{competitive}} play. However, an analysis {{based on one}} of these rating systems shows {{that he was one of}} the most dominant players in the history of the game. Steinitz was unbeaten in match play for 32 years, from 1862 to 1894.|$|E

5|$|Even {{after all}} Ostrom's work, several small blocks of lime-encased {{material}} remained unprepared in storage at the American Museum. These consisted mostly of isolated bones and bone fragments, including the original matrix, or surrounding rock {{in which the}} specimens were initially buried. An examination of these unprepared blocks by Gerald Grellet-Tinner and Peter Makovicky in 2000 revealed an interesting, overlooked feature. <b>Several</b> <b>long,</b> thin bones identified on the blocks as ossified tendons (structures that helped stiffen the tail of Deinonychus) turned out to actually represent gastralia (abdominal ribs). More significantly, {{a large number of}} previously unnoticed fossilized eggshells were discovered in the rock matrix that had surrounded the original Deinonychus specimen.|$|E

5|$|Under Eyles's command Temeraire {{finally put}} to sea {{at the end}} of July, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren, and joined the Channel Fleet under the overall command of Admiral Lord Bridport. The Channel Fleet was at that time principally engaged in the {{blockade}} of the French port of Brest, and Temeraire spent <b>several</b> <b>long</b> cruises of two or three months at a time patrolling the area. Eyles was superseded during this period by Temeraires former commander, Captain Puget, who resumed command on 14 October 1799, and the following month Temeraire became the flagship of Rear Admiral James Whitshed.|$|E

5|$|Florida State {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, and returned the opening kickoff to its 19-yard line. In his opening drive, Seminoles quarterback Drew Weatherford completed <b>several</b> <b>long</b> passes, including a long 37-yard strike from his own 48-yard line to drive the Seminoles' offense inside the Virginia Tech red zone. Once there, however, the Florida State offense began to struggle with the Virginia Tech defense, which had recovered somewhat from the initial shock of Weatherford's offensive success. On the three plays that followed Weatherford's 37-yard pass, Florida State managed only six positive yards, but this total was largely negated by a five-yard false start penalty that pushed FSU's offense backward. Facing a fourth down, Florida State coach Bobby Bowden sent in kicker Gary Cismesia to attempt a 31-yard field goal. The kick was successful, and the three points gave Florida State an early 30 lead with 11:06 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The secondquarter {{started with}} the Longhorns driving only sixyards and being forced to punt again. The Aggies {{continued}} to press their advantage and drove down the field until Stephen McGee threw an ill-timed pass that was intercepted by Deon Beasley at the Longhorn 25. Two first-downs later, Texas was forced to punt and pinned Texas A on their own fiveyard line. Stephen McGee led the offense with <b>several</b> <b>long</b> passes and the Aggies drove to the Texas 5 but again were held short on 3rd down. On 4th and three, the Aggies faked the field goal and the placeholder, T.J. Sanders, ran the ball in for his firstcareer touchdown giving the Aggies a 17–0 lead. The Longhorns started their next drive on their own 20-yard line, where Colt McCoy threw a 62-yard pass to Jamaal Charles. The drive stalled and the Longhorns {{had to settle for}} a field goal and went to halftime trailing their arch-rival, 17–3.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech won {{the opening}} coin toss and {{deferred}} its option {{to the second}} half. Boston College received the opening kickoff, which was downed {{in the end zone}} for a touchback. Starting at their own 20-yard line, the Eagles advanced down the field as quarterback Matt Ryan completed several passes and running back Andre Callender contributed <b>several</b> <b>long</b> runs. A pass interference call against Virginia Tech, coupled with a 10-yard run by Callender, put Boston College at the Virginia Tech 26-yard line. After three consecutive incomplete passes, Eagles kicker Steve Aponavicius attempted a 36-yard field goal. During the field goal, Virginia Tech special teams player Duane Brown broke through the Eagles' line and blocked the kick, giving Virginia Tech possession of the ball.|$|E
