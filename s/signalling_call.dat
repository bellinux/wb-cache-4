50|$|When a {{toll-free}} number is dialed, each digit is analyzed and processed by the LEC. The toll-free call {{is identified as}} such by the service switching point (SSP). The SSP is responsible for sending call information to the service control point (SCP), routing the request through at least one signal transfer point (STP) in the Signalling System 7 (SS7) network. SS7 is a digital out-of-band method of transmitting <b>signalling</b> (<b>call</b> control) information in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The SS7 network is a packet-switched network carrying signaling data (setup and tear down of the call and services) separate from the circuit-switched bearer network (the payload of the telephone call) in the AIN services network. The SSP asks the SCP where to send the call.|$|E

50|$|The {{basic idea}} of MACA is a {{wireless}} network node makes an announcement before it sends the data frame to inform other nodes to keep silent.

If the receiver allows the transmission, it replies the sender a <b>signal</b> <b>called</b> Clear-To-Send (CTS) with the length of the frame that is about to receive.Meanwhile, a node that hears RTS should remain silent to avoid conflict with CTS; a node that hears CTS should keep silent until the data transmission is complete.|$|R

Mission of Burma's music had the brawn and the volume of hardcore punk, but with a lyrical intelligence and obvious musical sophistication that set them apart from the Southern California faster-and-louder brigade." [...] Marc Masters of Pitchfork opined that the EP [...] "reverberated loudly through alternative rock for three decades, influencing everyone from R.E.M. to Fugazi to Nirvana." ...|$|R
