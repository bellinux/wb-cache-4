30|$|In 1985, Cooke and Ide {{put forward}} a process termed radius of error (Cooke and Ide 1985). Their method {{encouraged}} investigators to use fire patterns to arrive at an origin, but upon arriving at their hypothetical area(s) of origin required the investigator to provide some measure of accuracy {{in the form of}} a radius of error. Their example is as follows, “if the investigator decides he has located a <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> within a radius of error of 1  m, he is certain that the original <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> lays within an area having one metres [sic] radius (i.e. within an area of 3.14 square metres [sic])” (Cooke and Ide 1985). Their use of this method was stated to ensure that an investigator would be required to provide an indication of the degree of accuracy, as well as provide an area for excavation. This was the first time that investigators were encouraged to assign some reliability to their origin conclusion, however, the authors failed to provide guidelines on how specifically to arrive at the initial origin hypothesis.|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{was focused}} on the {{analysis}} of four compounds from brominated flame retardants group, namely pentabromoethylbenzene, hexabromocyclododecane, hexabromobenzene and tetrabromobisphenol A. Matrices were represented by four soil samples and four <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> samples. In addition, bisphenol A was also determined. First of all, process of extraction of analytes from matrices was optimized. Three different extraction techniques were tested (pressurized solvent extraction, microwave-assisted extraction and ultrasound-assisted extraction). Next step was to verify stability of target compounds in strongly acidic conditions and to optimize clean-up of extract by column chromatography. Gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD) was chosen as an appropriate analytical method for the determination of brominated flame retardants. Bisphenol A was determined by gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS). The derivatization of phenolic analytes before their final analytical determination was also essential...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} successfulness of forestation at a <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> near Bzenec. Several types of planting stock varying {{in the type of}} species, plant cover, the way of growing and coverage by surrounding growths after planting were used. Two independent measurings were taken, during which shoot height, root crown thickness, growt length, losses, vitality, diversion from vertical, trunk straightness, damage by biotic agents (mainly by forest cockchafer), the weight of dry matter and root deformations were investigated. The paper strip method executed by a rotary cultivator proved to be little effective, because cockchafer grubs were not affected in any way when the soil was prepared this way. Big losses were found out already during spring evaluation. These losses doubled, even tripled, during a vegetation period. The losses were caused mainly by cockchafer grubs. It is possible to recommend suitable forestation of weeded areas by containerized planting stock of pine and bare-rooted broad-leaved trees as a possible solution...|$|E

5000|$|For outdoor <b>fires,</b> the <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fire</b> is {{sprayed with}} a {{straight}} spray: the cooling effect immediately follows the [...] "asphyxia" [...] caused by vaporization and reduces the further amount of water required. A straight spray is used so the water arrives massively to the <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fire</b> before it vaporizes. A strong spray may also have a mechanical effect; it can disperse the combustible product and thus prevent the fire from starting again. Spray is always aimed at a surface or an object. For this reason, the strategy is sometimes called a two-dimensional or 2D attack.|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of this}} diploma thesis consists of current matters regarding the presence of perfluorinated organic compounds in living environment elements. The attention {{has been focused on}} perfluoroktanoic acid (PFOA), (PFOS), and (FOSA). Physical-chemical characteristics of these organic pollutants and their toxicological and environmental aspects have been described. Possible ways of the pollutants analytical determination have been specified. The experimental part has explored effects of extraction techniques (sonication, pressurized solvent extraction, solid-phase extraction) used for PFAS separation from <b>seats</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> soil sample. Identification of the analytes have been achieved by liquid chromatography/mass spektrometry...|$|R
40|$|July 8 th 1992 an {{explosion}} in a production vessel followed by a conflagration took place at a polymer-plant in Uithoorn, the Netherlands. This disaster resulted in an enormous havoc and an emission of combustion products and volatile compounds. Half burned materials were blown away and deposited on neighbouring pastures. The section Environmental Incidents and Environmental Medicine of RIVM arrived within two hours at the accident site and carried out many measurements on air quality. Due to the enormous heat of the fire and a corresponding rise of the flue gasses, an exposition of the neighbouring population was unlikely during {{the first phase of}} the fire. In the second stage of less fire, the flue gasses reached the earth surface. Near the <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> the levels of compounds like toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene were measured in concentrations up to 40 ppm. In the surrounding residential quarters the concentrations have been below 2 ppm. Also nitrogenoxyde, ozone, dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons proved to occur at background level, benzene was not detected. A few days later half-burned material has been collected from neighbouring pastures. It contained lead in contents up to 76 g/kg. Also the lead contents of grass and soil proved to be enhanced. It is unlikely that the high lead and also the high polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon level of grass and soil have been caused by the explosion. Former measurements (1985) of the lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contents of soil from the surroundings showed increased levels also. In the phase of evaporation, a few days after the fire, rather high concentrations of benzene (up to 507 mug/m 3) and other lower aromates could be measured near the demolished plant. ...|$|E
40|$|Characteristic {{features}} of firefighters’ rescue work are risks {{for their lives}} because of possible explosions and collapses, danger of injuries, limited visual range or complete absence of visibility, high temperature and high humidity. Extinguishing fires in different weather conditions, the firefighters can be influenced by abrupt and repeated changes in ambient temperature. Close to the <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> the rescuer is exposed to powerful thermal radiation that makes it necessary to use personal individual thermal protection means. Fire units in Ukraine are equipped with heat-reflective and thermal protective suits, that have become outdated, with rather limited protective service life and don't ensure safety of firefighters during extinguishing fires and rescue operations under high temperature conditions. The drawbacks of these existing protective suits reduce {{the efficiency of the}} firefighters’ rescue work. That is why the improvement of individual thermal protection means will make it possible to increase the efficiency of work within the areas of high temperatures. The purpose of the work is to identify ways of upgrading the safety and tactical possibilities of emergency rescue operations under high temperature conditions. The article analyzes the working conditions of the rescuers, various types of thermal protection structural features and applying autonomic cooling elements, defines limiting values of heat flows and ambient air temperature. The surface layers of the protective clothing are of time and temperature limited utility. Analysis showed that the existing means of thermal protection are of limited usefulness and are too massive thus restraining the activities of firefighters. It has been concluded {{that it is possible to}} use water or foam forming composition from fire fighting systems for cooling the body and clothes of the rescuers. Following these recommendations may increase the tactical possibilities of rescue units in extinguishing fires under high temperature condition...|$|E

5000|$|Rollover (also {{known as}} flameover) is a stage <b>of</b> a {{structure}} <b>fire</b> when fire gases {{in a room}} or other enclosed area ignite. [...] Since heated fire gases, the product of pyrolysis, rise to the ceiling, this is where a rollover phenomenon is most often witnessed. Visually, this {{may be seen as}} flames [...] "rolling" [...] across the ceiling, radiating outward from the <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fire</b> to the extent of gas spread.|$|R

50|$|Directly {{spraying}} the <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fire</b> in {{enclosed areas}} can have unfortunate consequences: {{the force of}} water pushes air in front of it, which supplies the fire with extra oxygen before the water. The most important issue is not combating the flames, but controlling the fire; for example, cooling the smoke so that it cannot spread and start fires further away, and endanger the lives of people, including the firefighters.|$|R
40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers belong {{among the}} persistent compounds, {{which have been}} classified as priority organic pollutants. In environmental compartments are observed in the past decade. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers are detected in abiotic and biotic matrices. For this dissertation were chosen the matrixes from <b>seats</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire,</b> taken in various localities of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Their analysis should demonstrate whether they in these specific matrices remain. There were examined following polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners: BDE- 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183. For their isolation from the matrix were used three different extraction techniques, namely ultrasonic extraction, microwave extraction and pressurized solvent extraction. For the determination was chosen method of GC / ECD. In this dissertation are also described basic chemical, physical and environmental properties of BDE, including other analytical methods {{that can be used}} to determine polybrominated diphenyl ethers in environmental compartments...|$|R
50|$|As the {{inspection}} of the mine revealed {{the fact that the}} <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fire</b> was at the 130 fathom level, where men had been engaged in putting in fresh timber, and not in the 171 fathom level, or in the levels above it, where machine drills were being employed. It can be reasonably certain to dismiss the second explanation at point 2 and that the disaster occurred as described in point 1.|$|R
5000|$|On Thursday 20 November 1980 at {{approximately}} 10:20pm a {{fire broke out}} in the School library. The fire completely destroyed the building along with almost all of its contents, including over 8000 books and a number of school records and historical items. The <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fire</b> was under a cabinet in the library office. It is now thought that vandals broke a window and threw in rags, impregnated with something flammable.|$|R
60|$|The fire {{began in}} the {{extensive}} wharves and warehouses known as Cotton's Wharf, near London Bridge, and was first observed in a warehouse over a counting-room by some workmen, who at once gave the alarm, and attempted to extinguish it with some buckets of water.

50|$|On {{the evening}} of 21 June 1979 at 8:27 pm, smoke was seen coming from the Priory. The London Fire Brigade {{fortunately}} arrived in good time and tried to fight the fire. Several teams went inside {{and tried to get}} the fire under control. Unfortunately, the electricity had not been switched off and as the firemen advanced to the <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fire,</b> they were surrounded by great sparks and had to beat a hasty retreat. The firemen spent the next morning damping down the smouldering remains and looking for the cause. It was quickly established that the fire was an accident and not arson.|$|R
5000|$|On St Valentine's Day (February 14) of 1988, {{there was}} a major fire in the hotel, which {{resulted}} in the deaths of four guests and two members <b>of</b> staff.

Initial attempts to fight the fire with extinguishers proved to be ineffective and a decision was made to utilise the fixed fire fighting medium and flood the space with CO2. This was effective in extinguishing the fire. With the high voltage switchboard out of commission, the vessel was towed to Sydney, where it remained for three months undergoing repairs.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} evening of 22 November 2001 the cathedral {{was hit by a}} fire thought to have been started {{deliberately}} amongst plastic chairs stored in the North Choir Aisle. Fortunately the fire was spotted by one of the vergers allowing a swift response by emergency services. The timing was particularly unfortunate as a complete restoration of the painted wooden ceiling was nearing completion. The oily smoke given off by the plastic chairs was particularly damaging, coating much of the building with a sticky black layer. The <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fire</b> was close to the organ and the combination of direct damage from the fire, and the water used to extinguish necessitated a full-scale rebuild of the instrument, putting it out of action for several years.|$|R

50|$|The first {{telephone}} {{call to the}} fire brigade was logged at 3:46 pm, though the phone operator simply stated that she was told to inform them there was a cellar fire at Ballantyne's. When the first fire appliance arrived about two minutes later at the Lichfield Street entrance the firefighters saw no sign <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> there. They then moved into Colombo Street where they saw smoke coming out of an enclosed alleyway. They were met by joint managing director Roger Ballantyne, who showed the fire crew a back access way to the cellar. They spent about 10 minutes searching for the <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fire</b> but were unable to locate it. Two other appliances had {{made their way to}} Ballantynes via Cashel Street and set up as the search commenced. The senior fire officer ordered a Brigade Call, although that order was only received by the fire station at 4:00 pm. The firefighter making the call had to first push through the crowd to get to a pharmacy and then had to wait for the overloaded telephone exchange lines to clear before he could make the call.|$|R
