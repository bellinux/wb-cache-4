5|$|This type of {{profile is}} common for dives at sites {{where there is a}} flat sea-bed or where the diver remains at the same place {{throughout}} the dive to work. It is the most demanding profile for decompression for a given maximum depth and time because inert gas absorption continues at maximum rate for most of the dive. Decompression tables are drawn up {{based on the assumption that}} the diver may follow a <b>square</b> <b>profile.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{built in}} {{response}} to Gloire, the Warriors had a very different operational concept from the French ship, which was meant to replace wooden ships of the line. The Warriors were designed by Watts as 40-gun armoured frigates and were not intended {{to stand in the}} line of battle, as the Admiralty was uncertain about their ability to withstand concentrated fire from wooden two- and three-deck ships of the line. Unlike Gloire, they were planned to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought to their own advantage. In contrast to Gloires <b>square</b> <b>profile,</b> Warrior has a clipper bow, but she is twice as long as a typical clipper ship.|$|E
5|$|Where {{the dive}} site and {{underwater}} topography permit, divers often prefer to descend to maximum depth and slowly ascend throughout the dive. A slow ascent, and therefore slow pressure reduction, {{is a good}} decompression practice. When using a dive computer this type of profile may not require additional decompression stops. Dive computers, unlike decompression tables, measure depth and time at short intervals during the dive and calculate the exact decompression indicated by the decompression model, which for a multilevel profile will be less than for the <b>square</b> <b>profile</b> with the same maximum depth and duration.|$|E

25|$|The Goldman model {{differs from}} the Kidd-Stubbs series {{decompression}} model in that the Goldman model assumes linear kinetics, where the K-S model includes a quadratic component, and the Goldman model considers only the central well-perfused compartment to contribute explicitly to risk, while the K-S model assumes all compartments to carry potential risk. The DCIEM 1983 model associates risk with the two outermost compartments of a four compartment series. The mathematical model based on this concept is claimed by Goldman to fit not only the Navy <b>square</b> <b>profile</b> data used for calibration, but also predicts risk relatively accurately for saturation profiles. A bubble version of the ICM model was not significantly different in predictions, and was discarded as more complex with no significant advantages. The ICM also predicted decompression sickness incidence more accurately at the low-risk recreational diving exposures recorded in DAN's Project Dive Exploration data set. The alternative models {{used in this study}} were the LE1 (Linear-Exponential) and straight Haldanean models. The Goldman model predicts a significant risk reduction following a safety stop on a low-risk dive and significant risk reduction by using nitrox (more so than the PADI tables suggest).|$|E
500|$|A dive {{profile is}} a {{description}} of a diver's pressure exposure over time. [...] It may be as simple as just a depth and time pair, as in: [...] "sixty for twenty," [...] (a stay of 20 minutes at a depth of 60 feet) or as complex as a second by second graphical representation of depth and time recorded by a personal dive computer. Several common types of dive profile are specifically named, and these may be characteristic of the purpose of the dive. For example, a working dive at a limited location will often follow a constant depth (<b>square)</b> <b>profile,</b> and a recreational dive is likely to follow a multilevel profile, as the divers start deep and work their way up a reef {{to get the most out}} of the available breathing gas. The names are usually descriptive of the graphic appearance.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike in blown film, pipe, and sheet {{extrusion}}, {{the dies}} used in profile extrusion are rarely round or completely flat. Whereas a round (or flat) profile has uniform flow rates along all edges, {{this is not}} the case for more complex shapes. Take, for instance, the example of a simple, solid, <b>square</b> <b>profile.</b> The velocity of the melt is highest at the center of the die, and slowest at the edges and corners due to friction between the melt and die walls. When moving from the center of the die to the midpoint of one of the edges, the velocity gradient is high, especially near the outer die wall. However, when moving from the center to one of the corners, the velocity gradient is more gradual. As a result, the extruded <b>square</b> <b>profile</b> will experience more die swell at the edges than the corners, causing the once <b>square</b> <b>profile</b> to become more circular. This can be compensated for by bowing in the sides of the die so it approximates the shape of a four-pointed star; the sides of the polymer melt will now swell to the intended dimensions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The paper proposes {{the index}} keys {{methodology}} of analysis of urban structures. The research {{stems from the}} descriptions of urban settings with regard to culture related issues. The geometrical analyses of public spaces, including the examination of streets and <b>squares</b> <b>profiles</b> and urban silhouettes, draw upon the writings of Kazimierz Wejchert, widely recognised for his contribution {{to the theory of}} urbanism in Poland. Cultural aspects of given settings require developing methods of description of public spaces. A few hypotheses are formulated concerning the relation between the crowd of people representing a given culture and the urban settings which constitute their habitus. Quantitative parameters describing the form of space are introduced, including: central angle, corrugation and regularity. The algorithmic method has been applied for the automatisation of the process. The preliminary results of analyses are presented as well as further research pathways.

40|$|High-speed {{particle}} image velocimetry (PIV) {{measurements of}} bypass transition reveal {{the breakdown of}} the ubiquitous streaks into turbulent spots. Individual streak velocity profiles are examined and contrasted with the root mean <b>square</b> <b>profiles</b> typically reported. An estimation of streak amplitude based on the modulation of the instantaneous boundary layer thickness is proposed. Examination of the PIV velocity fields shows how turbulent spot precursors, identified with concurrent hot-film recordings, consist of streamwise arrangements of positive and negative streaks. As secondary instability progresses, the interface between these streaks is observed to result in turbulent structures. In an attempt to further elucidate the role of the free stream turbulence, correlation maps are generated {{to determine the extent of}} the wall-normal fluctuations. Significant damping of the free stream is found within the boundary layer for all Reynolds numbers prior to the onset of spot precursors. © 2012 Cambridge University Press...|$|R
