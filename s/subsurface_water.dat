The induced moment is directed radially to or from Jupiter following {{the direction of the}} varying part of the planetary magnetic field. The induced magnetic moment is an order of magnitude weaker than the intrinsic one. The field strength of the induced field at the magnetic equator is about 60 nT—half of that of the ambient Jovian field. The induced magnetic field of Ganymede is similar to those of Callisto and Europa, indicating that Ganymede also has a <b>subsurface</b> <b>water</b> ocean with a high electrical conductivity.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} attribute of soils is that they function as <b>water</b> reservoirs. <b>Subsurface</b> <b>waters</b> — used as irrigation water — can contribute to nutrient supply, but their pollution has a negative impact on the conditions of cultivation. In our study we present the results of our investigation of ground and artesian water samples from the Great Hungarian Plain, mostly from Kecskemét and its surroundings. Based on the depth of the sampling points, we divided the samples into three categories: between 10 - 30, 31 - 70 and 71 - 275 meters. The results showed that the salt content is decreasing with the deepness, primarily because of the decrease in sodium, hydro-carbonate and chloride contents in the samples. The level of nitrogen and phosphorous-ions were low in almost all water samples. Iron, manganese and arsenic content were the highest in the middle deep waters (31 - 70 m depth). These results — {{especially in the case of}} iron and arsenic — can cause problems in the use of these waters in agriculture for cultivation and irrigation. Nowadays decreasing groundwater stocks decrease the water sources of irrigation.

25|$|San Cristóbal has the second-lowest rate of {{economic}} marginalization {{in the state}} of Chiapas following Tuxtla Gutiérrez. Only 4.5% of workers do not receive a salary or a regular income. Approximately 9% are employed in agriculture, compared to 54.86% regionally and 47.25% in the state. 21% are employed in construction, energy and transportation. The most important sector by economic output is mining. About 600 truckloads of jade, gravel, stone and metals are exported from San Cristóbal daily. Most of the material is destined to other municipalities in the region, although some goes to other cities in Chiapas and to states such as Tabasco and Campeche.

25|$|Other {{reasons for}} the decline are more {{scientific}} in nature. Climate change and trade isolation are probably also large {{reasons for the}} decline of the culture. The local subsistence base was substantially augmented by a climatic shift during the 1st century AD that reinforced the spring rains, extended the rainy season from 3 1/2 to six or seven months, vastly improved the surface and <b>subsurface</b> <b>water</b> supply, doubled the length of the growing season, and created an environment comparable to that of modern central Ethiopia-where two crops can be grown per annum without the aid of irrigation. This appears to explain how one of the marginal agricultural environments of Ethiopia was able to support the demographic base that made this far flung commercial empire possible. It may also explain why no Aksumite rural settlement expansion into the moister, more fertile, and naturally productive lands of Begemder or Lasta can be verified during the heyday of Aksumite power. As international profits from the exchange network declined, Aksum lost its ability to control its own raw material sources and that network collapsed. The already persistent environmental pressure of a large population to maintain a high level of regional food production had to be intensified. The result was a wave of soil erosion that began on a local scale c. 650 and attained catastrophic proportions after 700. Presumably complex socio-economic inputs compounded the problem. These are traditionally reflected in declining maintenance, deterioration and partial abandonment of marginal crop land, shifts to destructive pastoral exploitation, and eventual, wholesale and irreversible land degradation. This syndrome was possibly accelerated by an apparent decline in rainfall reliability beginning 730-760, with the presumed result that an abbreviated modern growing season was reestablished during the 9th century.|$|E
