25|$|Phosphine (IUPAC name: phosphane) is the {{compound}} with the chemical formula PH3. It is a colorless, flammable, toxic gas and pnictogen hydride. Pure phosphine is odorless, but technical grade samples have a highly unpleasant odor like garlic or rotting fish, {{due to the}} presence of substituted phosphine and diphosphane (P2H4). With traces of P2H4 present, PH3 is <b>spontaneously</b> <b>flammable</b> <b>in</b> <b>air,</b> burning with a luminous flame. Phosphines are also a group of organophosphorus compounds with the formula R3P (R = organic derivative). Organophosphines are important in catalysts where they complex to various metal ions; complexes derived from a chiral phosphine can catalyze reactions to give chiral, enantioenriched products.|$|E

50|$|Diphosphane adopts the gauche {{conformation}} (like hydrazine, less symmetrical than {{shown in the}} image) with a P-P distance of 2.219 angstroms. It is nonbasic, unstable at room temperature, and <b>spontaneously</b> <b>flammable</b> <b>in</b> <b>air.</b> It is only poorly soluble in water but dissolves in organic solvents. Its 1H NMR spectrum consists of 32 lines resulting from an A2XX'A'2 splitting system.|$|E
50|$|Most organoboranes are {{unstable}} <b>in</b> <b>air,</b> {{and volatile}} organoboranes are <b>spontaneously</b> <b>flammable</b> <b>in</b> the atmosphere. Thus, these reagents should be handled in an inert atmosphere. As organoboranes cannot be quenched effectively with water, {{they should be}} destroyed by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide. Boron hydrides should be quenched with water or, if more vigorous conditions are necessary, aqueous acid, prior {{to the introduction of}} hydrogen peroxide. Boranes are most commonly prepared by hydroboration of alkenes or alkynes.|$|R

50|$|Like other plutonium-producing reactors, conserving {{neutrons}} is a {{key element}} of the design. In magnox, the neutrons are moderated in large blocks of graphite. The core is open on one end, so fuel elements can be added or removed while the reactor is still running. The efficiency of graphite as a moderator allows the Magnox to run using natural uranium fuel, in contrast with the more common commercial light-water reactor which requires slightly enriched uranium. Graphite is highly <b>flammable</b> <b>in</b> <b>air,</b> so the core is cooled with CO2, which is then pumped into a heat exchanger to generate steam to drive conventional steam turbine equipment for power production.|$|R
50|$|Fluoromethane has an {{agreeable}} ether-like odor {{and is also}} narcotic in high concentrations. Fluoromethane {{is highly}} <b>flammable</b> and burns <b>in</b> <b>air</b> with evolution of highly toxic hydrogen fluoride. The flame is colorless, similar to alcohol.|$|R
40|$|Dimethyl ether (DME) {{is highly}} water-soluble, has a melting point of- 141. 5 °C and boils at- 24. 8 °C. DME is a colorless gas at room {{temperature}} with an ethereal odor, a vapor pressure of 4450 mm Hg @ 25 °C and is highly <b>flammable</b> <b>in</b> <b>air</b> (3. 4 - 18 %). When released to air, DME exists as a vapor at ambient temperatures. Degradation of DME <b>in</b> <b>air</b> occurs by reaction with hydroxyl and nitrate radicals with estimated half-lives of 5. 4 and 123 days, respectively. Direct photolysis {{is not expected to}} be an important degradation process. If released into rivers or lakes, DME is expected to volatilize with estimated half-lives of 2. 1 hours and 2. 7 days, respectively. Lacking a hydrolyzable functional group, DME is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment. DME exhibits low toxicity to fish and aquatic invertebrates with a low bioconcentration potential in aquatic organisms. DME exhibits low acute toxicity by the inhalation route with a 4 -hour LC 50 in rats of 164, 000 ppm (16. 4 % DME <b>in</b> <b>air).</b> <b>In</b> beagle dogs, DME has been shown to produce cardiac sensitization following inhalation of ≥ 200, 000 ppm DME (20 % DME) but not at 100, 000 ppm DME (10 % DME).

The sensor is able to detect hydrogen in a concentration range from below one ppm to the lower <b>flammable</b> limit <b>in</b> <b>air</b> which is 4 vol. -%. The chip operates at room temperature which results in an extremely low energy consumption compared to other hydrogen sensors. Only once per day a short heating pulse is necessary to reactivate the sensor chip. In cooperation with the BAM, a long-term experiment was carried out. The duration of the measurement was about three months, with a hydrogen exposure every two weeks. The sensor signal remained stable over the measured period...|$|R

50|$|All liquids have a {{specific}} vapor pressure, which {{is a function of}} that liquid's temperature and is subject to Boyle's Law. As temperature increases, vapor pressure increases. As vapor pressure increases, the concentration of vapor of a flammable or combustible liquid <b>in</b> the <b>air</b> increases. Hence, temperature determines the concentration of vapor of the <b>flammable</b> liquid <b>in</b> the <b>air.</b> A certain concentration of a flammable or combustible vapor is necessary to sustain combustion <b>in</b> <b>air,</b> the lower <b>flammable</b> limit, and that concentration is different and is specific to each flammable or combustible liquid. The flash point is the lowest temperature at which there will be enough flammable vapor to induce ignition when an ignition source is applied.|$|R
40|$|Catalytic {{flammable}} gas sensors detect {{the presence of}} <b>flammable</b> gasses <b>in</b> <b>air</b> at a non-dangerous concentration level, thus helping {{in the prevention of}} explosion risks. These devices are usually operated without thermal control i. e. they measure the temperature increase of a detector induced by the catalytic combustion of the {{flammable gas}}. We propose the system-level design of a bias and readout system that directly measures the heat produced by the catalytic combustion. The proposed solution operates the sensor at a constant temperature via a feedback scheme that contains two thermal feedback loops. We chose a feedback control that uses pulse-density modulation, thus the proposed system implements a direct analog-to-digital conversion of the heat produced by the catalytic combustion. In practice, this mixed-signal front-end for pellistors is expected to extend the functionality and precision of the sensor while providing with a simple implementation...|$|R

25|$|In the U.S., OSHA lists vinyl {{chloride}} as a Class IA Flammable Liquid, with a National Fire Protection Association Flammability Rating of 4. Because of its low boiling point, liquid VCM will undergo flash evaporation (i.e., autorefrigerate) upon its release to atmospheric pressure. The portion vaporized will form a dense cloud (more {{than twice as}} heavy as the surrounding air). The risk of subsequent explosion or fire is significant. According to OSHA, the flash point of {{vinyl chloride}} is −78°C (−108.4°F). Its <b>flammable</b> limits <b>in</b> <b>air</b> are: lower 3.6 volume% and upper 33.0 volume%. The explosive limits are: lower 4.0%, upper 22.05 by volume <b>in</b> <b>air.</b> Fire may release toxic hydrogen chloride (HCl) and carbon monoxide (CO). VCM can polymerise rapidly due to heating and {{under the influence of}} air, light and contact with a catalyst, strong oxidisers and metals such as copper and aluminium, with fire or explosion hazard. As a gas mixed with air, VCM is a fire and explosion hazard. On standing VCM can form peroxides, which may then explode. VCM will react with iron and steel in the presence of moisture. Vinyl chloride is a gas at normal atmospheric temperature and pressure.|$|R

40|$|AbstractFundamental {{solutions}} {{were developed}} and energy-saving parameters of a catalytic sensor operation {{were chosen for}} using a catalytic sensor in non-volatile wireless sensor networks. Energy-saving mode is based on cyclic method, where every cycle includes short current pulse and the pause between pulses does not exceed regulated by normative documents “response time” for sensors working in continuous mode. To reduce current pulse duration, heating and measuring processes are combined. Two-staged pulse shape was chosen for this, the first stage accelerates heating, the second one is measuring, where we reduce sensor supply voltage and heating temperature, form transient cooling of the sensing element, then measure cooling rate, which is proportional to measured concentration of <b>flammable</b> gas <b>in</b> the <b>air...</b>|$|R

5000|$|A {{flammable}} solid {{is one that}} is readily combustible or may cause or contribute to fire through friction. Readily combustible solids are powdered, granular, or pasty substances which are dangerous if they can be easily ignited by brief contact with an ignition source, such as a burning match, and if the flame spreads rapidly. it is further divided into • {{flammable solid}}s, • polymerizing substances and • self-reactive substances, i.e., thermally unstable solids liable to undergo a strongly exothermic thermal decomposition even without participation of oxygen (air) other than materials classified as explosive, organic peroxides or as oxidizing.Spontaneously combusting solids or pyrophoric solids are solids that, even in small quantities, are liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category {{on the basis of the}} outcome of the UN Test N.2. Self-heating substances are solids or liquids, other than a pyrophoric substance, which, by reaction with air and without energy supply, are liable to self-heat. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.4. Substances which on contact with water emit flammable gases are liable to become <b>spontaneously</b> <b>flammable</b> or to give off <b>flammable</b> gases <b>in</b> dangerous quantities. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of UN Test N.5, which measures gas evolution and speed of evolution. Flammable aerosols can be classified as Class 1 or Class 2 if they contain any component, which is classified as flammable.|$|R
