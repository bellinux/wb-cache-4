500|$|Although {{the coins}} have a <b>smooth</b> <b>edge,</b> rather than reeded {{as with other}} silver coins, the new piece {{was close to the}} size of, and {{immediately}} confused with, the quarter. [...] Adding to the bewilderment, the obverse, or [...] "heads", sides of both coins were almost identical. [...] After the first year, in which over a million were minted, there was little demand, and the denomination was abolished in 1878. [...] At least a third of the total mintage was later melted by the government. Numismatist Mark Benvenuto called the twenty-cent piece [...] "a chapter of U.S. coinage history that closed almost before it began".|$|E
500|$|Coloman {{decided to}} review his predecessors' decrees around 1100. Because he {{regarded}} Stephen I of Hungary, {{who had been}} canonized in 1083, as his ideal, he [...] "assembled the magnates of the kingdom and reviewed with {{the advice of the}} entire council the text of the laws" [...] of Stephen I. The assembly also passed decrees, which regulated several aspects of the economy and tempered the harshness of the legislation of LadislausI. One of the decrees prohibited the persecution of strigaevampires or maresbecause they [...] "do not exist". The same law also dealt with malefici or [...] "sorcerers", punishing their misdeeds. Taxes on trade were increased under Coloman, implying that commerce flourished in his reign. However, his legislation prohibited the export of Hungarian slaves and horses. Coins minted during his reign were smaller than those issued in his predecessor's reign to prevent the cutting down of their <b>smooth</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|E

The cap is very variable in colour, sometimes cream though often tinted with orange, brownish, greyish, purple or even bluish-black shades. The margin is lighter, generally cream, though brown forms have tan or brown edges. The centre generally has several darker shades, and younger specimens are often darker. Growing up to [...] in diameter it is funnel-shaped or fan-shaped in appearance with inrolled margins. The cream-white gills are decurrent and often drip with moisture. They are up to [...] deep, somewhat distant to closely spaced, and have a <b>smooth</b> <b>edge</b> until they erode in maturity. The stipe may be central to lateral in its attachment to the cap and is up to [...] long and tapers to the base. The thin flesh is generally creamy white in colour, but can have reddish tones near the base of the stipe. There is no distinctive smell or taste. The spore print is white.|$|E

40|$|In reverse engineering, the {{reconstruction}} of a surface model from a point cloud requires the extraction of closed feature lines at {{the borders of the}} different surface patches. In this paper we propose a new algorithm to extract such closed polygonal feature lines, representing sharp or <b>smooth</b> <b>edges,</b> from a point cloud. Based on the variation of the normal vectors and a graph approach we extract the sharp edges, which are used to divide the point cloud in <b>smooth</b> regions. <b>Smooth</b> <b>edges,</b> such as fillets, are extracted for each smooth region separately using a novel approach for 1 D-histogram thresholding: we use the curvature histogram in a multi-resolution manner in order to split a point set in different regions of similar curvature (patches). The polygonal <b>smooth</b> <b>edges</b> at the borders between these different patches are extracted by point clustering and processing a graph of the point clusters. status: publishe...|$|R

2500|$|Dollar coins {{have not}} been very popular in the United States. [...] Silver dollars were minted {{intermittently}} from 1794 through 1935; a copper-nickel dollar of the same large size, featuring President Dwight D. Eisenhower, was minted from 1971 through 1978. Gold dollars were also minted in the 19th century. The Susan B. Anthony dollar coin was introduced in 1979; these proved to be unpopular because they were often mistaken for quarters, due to their nearly equal size, their milled edge, and their similar color. Minting of these dollars for circulation was suspended in 1980 (collectors' pieces were struck in 1981), but, as with all past U.S. coins, they remain legal tender. As the number of Anthony dollars held by the Federal Reserve and dispensed primarily to make change in postal and transit vending machines had been virtually exhausted, additional Anthony dollars were struck in 1999. In 2000, a new $1 coin, featuring Sacagawea, (the Sacagawea dollar) was introduced, which corrected {{some of the problems}} of the Anthony dollar by having a <b>smooth</b> <b>edge</b> and a gold color, without requiring changes to vending machines that accept the Anthony dollar. However, this new coin has failed to achieve the popularity of the still-existing $1 bill and is rarely used in daily transactions. The failure to simultaneously withdraw the dollar bill and weak publicity efforts have been cited by coin proponents as primary reasons for the failure of the dollar coin to gain popular support.|$|E

50|$|The main {{advantage}} of this technique over conventional anti-aliasing {{is that it does}} not require large amounts of computing power.

In addition it <b>smooths</b> <b>edges</b> in all pixels on the screen, including those inside alpha-blended textures and those resulting from pixel shader effects, which were previously immune to the effects of multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA).|$|R
