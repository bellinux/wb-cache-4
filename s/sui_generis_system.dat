40|$|This paper {{examines}} the obligations in TRIPS {{with respect to}} introducing plant breeders’ rights (PBRs) in developing and least developed nations. Furthermore, the article {{examines the}} effect of introducing plant variety protection {{in the context of}} other policies that impact agriculture. Without addressing directly whether protection of PBRs is justified, this paper makes two arguments. First, the flexibility embedded in Article 27. 3 of TRIPS to adopt <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>systems</b> of protecting PBRs will be defeated if UPOV is deemed to be either a mandatory requirement or if UPOV establishes the minimum standards for a <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> PBRs <b>system</b> because UPOV is an ineffective mechanism for protecting plant varieties. Second, notwithstanding UPOV, agricultural subsidies will offset any benefits likely to flow to nations introducing PBRs. The effect of agricultural subsidies can be detrimental to the prevailing economic conditions in nations that newly introduce plant variety protection. The immense shortage of food in some developing nations creates the need to be cautious before introducing any mechanism that may upset the status quo. The paper concludes that for developing nations to accrue meaningful benefits, reforms in agricultural subsidies should precede introduction of PBRs. Developing nations, considering the 2005 deadline for TRIPS compliance, should seek an extension of the transitional period for compliance with the plant variety protection requirement under Article 27. 3 until completion of the negotiations of the Cancun issues on agriculture...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{particularly}} since 1995, {{intellectual property law}} has become an integral component of trade, whereas in the past {{it used to be}} a fundamental element of development policy. This shift in the primary concept and function of the intellectual property system, due to its association with global trade, demands massive changes in national regimes, which may or may not serve the interest of their citizens and other domestic stakeholders. Such an issue becomes crucial when it is related to basic human necessities such as food and livelihood. It is particularly important when the actors involved are developing and least developed countries (LDCs). While the development of national intellectual property systems requires careful governmental and administrative development because of their important relationship to livelihood, such a need has been overshadowed by the almost coercive position adopted in the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). One can argue that the TRIPS agreement is in many ways a defence of sophisticated developed economy trade protection. However, despite this general stance, Article 27. 3. b of the TRIPS agreement, in principle, offers an opportunity for countries to develop an effective <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>system</b> to protect plants and other related materials. Whilst Article 27. 3. b of the TRIPS agreement, on its face, offers a powerful freedom, there is enough evidence that the international community, particularly various actors from developed countries, is increasingly circumscribing this discretionary autonomy in many different ways. This thesis, therefore, analyses the spirit of Art. 27. 3. b of the TRIPS agreement so as to understand what exactly it means when it states that plants can be protected under an effective <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>system.</b> For the philosophical underpinning, it considers the "Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of the State", Rawls' concept of "Distributive Justice" particularly in relation to the development of the farmer's right, and Gewirth's moral and ethical philosophy. These established theories are considered in the international law context. Finally, the thesis analyses the current situation in the area, advances an alternative framework for the negotiations of <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>system</b> by particular States and suggests guidelines for 'effective' plant sui generis systems under Art. 27. 3. b of the TRIPS agreement.

40|$|International audiencePlant {{breeding}} {{is a high}} resource consuming activity. As such, mechanisms {{have been}} set to protect crops cultivars and favour investments in plant breeding activities. Several countries have adopted either the patent system or a <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>system</b> to protect cultivars. In 2013, Ghana passed the Plant Breeder Bill, a <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>system.</b> The bill has not been enforced yet but several benefits for farmers, breeders and agriculture in {{the country have been}} predicted. This paper discusses the most probable implications of the Plant Breeder Bill on breeding activities in Ghana. Information was collected from key informants and the literature related to the experience in other countries where the Plant Breeders " Right has been enforced. It came out that the implementation of the plant breeder Bill in Ghana is likely to attract private investment. More investments would be devoted to breeding of hybrid varieties in high commercial value crops. The probable increase of investment on breeding activities is likely to make available more new varieties offering more available starting material for breeding programs. However, the enforcement of the 2 Bill without the creation of incentive environment notably in seed system would not be enough to reach the predicted benefits. Furthermore, the development of new varieties is likely to result in the replacement of existing varieties including landraces leading to genetic erosion. To overcome this, extensive collection of landraces and conservation strategies need to be undertaken...|$|E
40|$|Geographical Indications (GIs) are designations that {{identify}} products as originating {{in a specific}} geographical region, that have characteristics essentially linked to their territorial origin. While accepted by many countries as an important tool for differentiating products and identifying quality standards, there is an international division over {{the best way to}} protect GIs. The EU supports a sui generis regime with higher levels of protection, while the United States argues that trade mark law is sufficient. Despite being a strong agricultural food exporter, New Zealand has done little to market the geographical origin of its goods. Currently, New Zealand protects GIs through misrepresentation laws and certification marks. This paper questions whether New Zealand should introduce a <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>system.</b> It argues that while there are some domestic benefits from enhanced protection, these must be counterbalanced with the costs and potential detrimental rigidities of a <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>system.</b> The key benefits for New Zealand would be the international trade advantages, namely gaining protection in export markets with GI systems, facilitating a free-trade agreement with the EU, and putting New Zealand in a strong position if a multilateral GI register is established. New Zealand is at risk of undermining future developments if the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement proceeds as {{it has the potential to}} preclude any GI deals by granting trade marks enhanced status. This paper submits that New Zealand should remain open to the potential benefits of granting GIs greater protection, rather than missing out on future international developments...|$|E

40|$|It is {{commonly}} agreed that {{international criminal law}} (ICL) is a ‘hybrid’ legal culture, which mixes the legal traditions of the common law and civil law.

To address this problem, the paper develops a new account of ICL as a global legal culture. The paper first identifies the distinctive ‘cultural logic’ of ICL, drawing on the example of recent developments in sexual violence offences. It then examines how ICL takes a global legal form, which ‘globalizes’ liberal legal culture. Finally, the paper shows how this process of making the legal culture of ICL ‘global’ creates its cultural contradictions, but also enables the possibility of making a new legal culture at the international level...|$|E

Thus, Part I examines Article 27. 3 of TRIPS to analyze the constituents of the effectiveness requirement of the article. In analyzing whether the <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>system</b> in UPOV is effective, Part II details that UPOVs effectiveness is questionable considering that it has diluted eligibility standards, exaggerated scope of breeders rights, and limited exceptions to breeders rights. Part III, examines the effectiveness of PPVFA and the proposed Seeds Bill. This part concludes that India should refrain from enacting the Seeds Bill but should, instead, strengthen the PPVFA by plugging existing loopholes to achieve national objectives.

40|$|Neoliberalism is oft invoked but {{ill-defined}} in {{the social}} sciences. This paper develops a tripartite definition of neoliberalism using tools from institutionalism and field theory. It argues that neoliberalism is a <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> ideological <b>system</b> born of historical processes of struggle and collaboration in three worlds: intellectual, bureaucratic, and political. Among neoliberalism’s three ‘faces,’ its mode {{as a form of}} politics has received the least attention. To fill this gap, I develop a definition of neoliberal politics as struggles over political authority that are bounded by a particularly market-centric set of ideas about the state’s responsibilities, the locus of state authority, and the state’s central constituencies.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{major issues}} and challenges for Animal Genetic Resources (AnGR) and the livestock sector, as well as options for further development of policies or regulatory approaches. Three main areas were identified, i) how we can halt the further erosion of genetic diversity and promote sustainable breeding and use, ii) {{whether there is a}} need to regulate the exchange of genetic material and iii) how to balance different systems of rights (e. g. sovereign rights of nations, intellectual property rights, communal rights or rights of livestock keepers). To halt further erosion, complementary ex-situ and in-situ conservation approaches are needed and breeding and marketing of local breeds should be strengthened. Secondly, recognizing the importance of the exchange of AnGR, broad access and responsible and equitable exchange mechanisms should be further promoted. Thirdly, regarding intellectual property rights, {{there is a need to}} adapt the application of the patent system to the special circumstances inherent in animal breeding. Moreover, possible <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>systems</b> should be further explored in order to better balance different rights systems. Rather than developing a new or adapted internationally legally binding framework, the intergovernmental process under FAO may instead wish to focus, in the first instance, on the development of voluntary instruments to strengthen national policies and the implementation of action at national levels. Debates and developments related to international agreements in the crop sector have also tended to frame the debate for AnGR. However, before launching into a discussion on whether or not an ‘FAO Animal Treaty’ would be needed, one should first of all clarify the problems to be dealt with and regulated via an international regime...|$|R
40|$|ArticleThe {{notions of}} {{indigenous}} peoples, indigenous knowledge, and heritage and culture have acquired wide usage in international debates on sustainable development and intellectual property protection {{since the turn}} of the 20 th century. This paper, through an examination of the concept of intellectual property and its intersection with culture and heritage, elucidates the nature and scope of indigenous intellectual property rights as represented by traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions and genetic resources. This paper, through a review of the interface between indigenous knowledge systems and the intellectual property law regime, illustrates the limitations of conventional intellectual property rights systems i. e. : copyright, patent, trade secrets and trademark in providing adequate recognition and protection for indigenous intellectual property rights. It also posits that the establishment of a <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>system</b> of protection offers a plausible solution to the inadequacy of the existing regimes of protection.

40|$|Due to its {{scientific}} value, economic potential, {{and social}} background basis, traditional knowledge (TK) is valued {{of great importance}} under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and by other international fora. The Convention has made enormous efforts {{for the protection of}} TK relevant to biodiversity. For instance, an ad hoc working group on Article 8 (j) and related provisions was established; programmes of work and action plans on the implementation of Article 8 (j) and related provisions were developed and implemented; the negotiation of <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>system</b> of TK was promoted; and several voluntary guidelines plus the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from Their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity were adopted.

The various provisions possible in a <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>system</b> of plant varietal protection (PVP) are summarised, including those specified in the existing Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) treaties of 1978 and 1991.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to find an {{operative}} definition of traditional knowledge for purposes of drug research and development. Starting out with the international debate on Art. 8 (j) of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 1993 and the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, 1995, it argues that the critical elements of any <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>system</b> should be rights' definitions that clearly identify the nature of information that is to be protected as traditional knowledge and the set of beneficiaries that are to exercise the right. Using the theory of cumulative innovation in biotechnology-based pharmaceutical research, the paper derives a justification for an intellectual property right for traditional medicinal knowledge that is based on its actual/ potential contribution to pharmaceutical research. Such a right, apart from clearly giving us the basis for demarcating communities/ groups of people who ought to exercise it, also helps achieve three incentive effects - the incentive to reveal information that is useful for the society at large, the incentive to keep such knowledge pools intact and lastly, the incentive to conserve biodiversity. These incentive effects provide us with a more robust basis to argue for a sui generis right over traditional medicinal knowledgeIntellectual Property Rights, Traditional Medicine, Pharmaceutical Industry, Research and Development, Biotechnology, Biodiversity, Indigenous Knowledge...|$|E
40|$|In {{comparison}} with industrialised countries, agriculture {{in developing countries}} accounts for a substantial share of GDP and involves a substantial sector of small-holders and traditional agriculturalists. In view of these differences, the biotechnology clause of Article 27. 3. b TRIPS with its requirement of plant variety protection either by patents or an effective <b>sui</b> <b>generis</b> <b>system</b> {{or a combination of}} the two has been controversial. However, developing countries have made surprisingly little use of the freedom to design their own systems in this field. Instead, there has been a surge in UPOV membership among developing countries and some have gone as far as introducing patent protection for plant varieties. Such countries now have to consider the same exclusions and exceptions to patenting that are normally discussed in countries with much more advanced biotechnology industries. The chapter examines the scope for the use of orde public considerations under Article 27. 2 TRIPS, of exceptions for research and experimental purposes under Article 30 TRIPS, compulsory licensing under Article 31 TRIPS as well as the advantages of a specific breeding exemption and it briefly comments on the various sui generis options. While liberal interpretations of the TRIPS exceptions remain possible, the chapter concludes that the majority of developing countries will be better off in more creatively using the freedom to develop sui generis systems suitable for their local conditions rather than struggling to introduce TRIPS conform limited exceptions’ to patent protection for plant varieties...|$|E

40|$|This is the {{scientific}} report from a research programme which explored the current {{lack of a}} suitable public system for protecting GIs in Southern Africa. In contrast to the European Union, the current South African legal framework only provides {{for the protection of}} GIs as collective and, in certain circumstances, as certification trademarks. The lack of a public system through which to valorize GIs was identified as excluding resource poor farmers (but also commercial larger scale farmers) from a potentially useful tool for improving their market access.
