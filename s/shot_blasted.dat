40|$|<b>Shot</b> <b>blast</b> {{material}} is a supporting material in foundry {{which is used}} at surface finishing process of metal casting.

This research use the raw material from scrap iron with the following composition: C (3. 2 %), Si (1. 18 %), Mn (6. 1 %), Cu (0. 35 %), Fe (88. 7 %). The scrap is melted in induction furnace untill melt (hot metal), then the hot metal (1200 oC) is tilted into a runner which is connected with pan crucible, which is consisted of 107 holes with diameter of each holes is 10 mm. Hot metal that is leave from the holes, is injected by pressurized water 1. 1 atm with the velocity 0. 8 m/s, untill obtained grains of <b>shot</b> <b>blast</b> material, then these grains goes into the water tank which it has temperature 40 oC. From thermodynamic study, to avoid the happening of the explosion that is arising out because the effect of high temperature difference at injection process beetween water and hot metal, hence the comparison value beetween the mass of water and hot metal equal to 1 : 4. 6.

Having removed the British flagship from action, the American forces captured or destroyed the remaining larger ships in the fleet.|$|E
50|$|The {{accuracy}} of the casting {{is limited by the}} type of sand and the molding process. Sand castings made from coarse green sand impart a rough texture to the surface, and this makes them easy to identify. Castings made from fine green sand can shine as cast but are limited by the depth to width ratio of pockets in the pattern. Air-set molds can produce castings with smoother surfaces than coarse green sand but this method is primarily chosen when deep narrow pockets in the pattern are necessary, due to the expense of the plastic used in the process. Air-set castings can typically be easily identified by the burnt color on the surface. The castings are typically <b>shot</b> <b>blasted</b> to remove that burnt color. Surfaces can also be later ground and polished, for example when making a large bell. After molding, the casting is covered with a residue of oxides, silicates and other compounds. This residue can be removed by various means, such as grinding, or shot blasting.|$|E

40|$|The {{oxide scale}} created during {{manufacturing}} {{of stainless steel}} is often removed by a chemical pickling with mixed acid. Various pre-treatments to pickling are also applied {{to increase the efficiency}} of the oxide scale removal. <b>Shot</b> <b>blasting</b> is one such pre-treatment, which operates to remove a certain amount of oxide and also to generate cracks and openings for the subsequent pickling. In this work, three materials, AISI 2205, 430 and 304 have been blasted and later exposed to mixed acid. This was conducted to quantify the effect <b>shot</b> <b>blasting</b> has on the subsequent pickling of stainless steel. Three shot products and two blasting parameters were investigated and varied. <b>Shot</b> <b>blasting</b> significantly reduced the oxide scale but was unable to remove the chromium oxide layer closest to the steel surface. No significant difference was observed when comparing the result from the three <b>shot</b> products after <b>blasting.</b> Increasing the particle velocity or the coverage rate further enhanced the pickling but reduced the amount of oxide removed during blasting. These effects are however relative small, so in practise relatively mild conditions seems preferable for economic reasons.

40|$|This {{research}} investigates and analyzes {{wear properties}} of 316 stainless steel {{before and after}} applying paste boronizing process and to investigate the effect of shot blasting process in enhancing boron dispersion into the steel. In order to enhance the boron dispersion into 316 stainless steel, surface deformation method by shot blasting process was deployed. Boronizing treatment was conducted using paste medium for 8 hours under two different temperatures which were 8500 C and 9500 C. Wear behaviour was evaluated using pin-on-disc test for abrasion properties. The analysis on microstructure, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and density were also carried out before and after applying boronizing treatment. Boronizing process that had been carried out on 316 stainless steel increases the wear resistance of the steel compared to the unboronized 316 stainless steel. The effect of boronizing treatment together with the shot blasting process give a greater impact in increasing the wear resistance of 316 stainless steel. This is mainly because <b>shot</b> <b>blasted</b> samples initiated surface deformation that helped more boron dispersion due to dislocation of atom on the deformed surface. Increasing the boronizing temperature also increases the wear resistance of 316 stainless steel. In industrial application, the usage of the components that have been fabricated using the improved 316 stainless steel can be maximized because repair and replacement of the components can be reduced {{as a result of}} improved wear resistance of the 316 stainless steel...|$|E
40|$|<b>Shot</b> <b>blasting</b> {{machines}} {{are widely used}} for automated surface treatment and finishing of castings. In <b>shot</b> <b>blasting</b> processes the stream of shots is generated and shaped by blasting turbines, making up a kinetic and dynamic system comprising a separating rotor, an adapting sleeve and a propelling rotor provided with blades. The <b>shot</b> <b>blasting</b> performance- i. e. the quality of shot treated surfaces depends on the actual design and operational parameters of the unit whilst the values of relevant parameters {{are associated with the}} geometry of turbine components and the level of its integration with the separator system. The circulation of the blasting medium becomes the integrating factor of the process line, starting from the hopper, through the propeller turbine, casting treatment, separation of contaminated abrasive mixture, to its recycling and reuse. Inferior quality of the abrasive agent (shot) and insufficient purity of the abrasive mixture are responsible for low effectiveness of <b>shot</b> <b>blasting.</b> However, most practitioners fail to fully recognise the importance of proper diagnostics of the <b>shot</b> <b>blasting</b> process in industrial conditions. The wearing of major machine components and of the blasting agent and quality of shot treated surfaces are often misinterpreted, hence the need to take into account all factors involved in the process within the frame of a comprehensive methodology.

40|$|Abstract. Fire {{safety is}} a major concern with steel {{structures}}. Actually, steel structures were not fatally destroyed in most cases of fire. These damaged steel structures may be reused after structural inspection, safety appraisal and necessary repair. Bolted connections are the most widely used connection in steel structures. Slip coefficient is a key parameter to calculate the slip bearing capacity of bolted slip-critical connections. Currently there are few research results available about slip coefficient of bolted slip-critical connections after fire.
