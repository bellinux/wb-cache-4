5|$|After {{returning}} home to Singapore, Priya and Honey are fired by their boss (Archana Puran Singh) for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. In order to keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Krishna's grandmother objects to this, saying that {{people will want to}} take advantage of his abilities. She then explains that his father Rohit was hired by Dr. Siddhant Arya (Naseeruddin Shah) to design a computer that could <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> in order to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. However, Rohit later found out that the purpose of the computer was not for good purposes and he destroyed the machine. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of a broken heart shortly thereafter. Krishna promises his grandmother that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself much to the disappointment of Honey and Priya, who get fired again.|$|E

5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Serah is {{the only}} one who remembers Lightning being on Gran Pulse after she is taken to Valhalla, with all the others believing she sacrificed herself to save Cocoon. She {{eventually}} becomes a teacher in the village of New Bodhum, the town she and Snow help build on Gran Pulse, before it is invaded by monsters three years after the fall of Cocoon. Serah is aided by Noel Kreiss, who tells her of Lightning's fate and his own mission. After Serah accepts Noel's offer to be brought to Lightning, the two embark on a journey across time to find her sister. In the process, Serah encounters Caius Ballad, while learning from Paddra Nsu-Yeul that she possesses the same detrimental ability as her to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> Despite learning that she would die herself if she continues seeing visions of the future, Serah resolves to change the future for everyone's sake. However, after Caius's defeat and returning to Gran Pulse five hundred years in her future, Serah has another vision and dies moments before Gran Pulse is infected by Valhalla's chaos. Serah appears to Lightning in Valhalla as a spirit, telling her she knew that she could have died from her visions but still took the risk regardless. Serah promises Lightning that they will see each other again as long as Lightning promises to remember her. In Lightning Returns, Serah's soul, which has been kept safe within Lightning, is removed and cast away by Bhunivelze. Lumina acts as a shelter for Serah's soul, resulting in the two being similar in appearance. Bhunivelze also creates a false version of Serah to keep Lightning in line. This false Serah, who develops feelings for her 'sister' arrives when Lightning intends to become the protector of the new world and persuades her to accept her vulnerabilities and call for aid. The real Serah reunites with Lightning and her allies, and travels with them to the new world.|$|E

25|$|Adolescents' {{thinking}} is less bound to concrete events {{than that of}} children: they can contemplate possibilities {{outside the realm of}} what currently exists. One manifestation of the adolescent's increased facility with thinking about possibilities is the improvement of skill in deductive reasoning, which leads to the development of hypothetical thinking. This provides the ability to plan ahead, <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> consequences of an action and to provide alternative explanations of events. It also makes adolescents more skilled debaters, as they can reason against a friend's or parent's assumptions. Adolescents also develop a more sophisticated understanding of probability.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the ancient}} designations are still adhered to, in modern Shinto many priests also {{consider}} kami to be anthropomorphic spirits, with nobility and authority. One such {{example is the}} mythological figure Amaterasu-ōmikami, the sun goddess of the Shinto pantheon. Although these kami can be considered deities, they are not necessarily considered omnipotent or omniscient, and like the Greek Gods, they had flawed personalities and were quite capable of ignoble acts. In the myths of Amaterasu, for example, {{she could see the}} events of the human world, but had to use divination rituals to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b>|$|E

The Bolsheviks proclaimed {{the need for the}} dictatorship of the proletariat, and agitated for a worldwide Communist community. They had an avowed intent to link the revolution in Russia with an expected revolution in Germany and to assist other Communist movements in Western Europe; Poland was the geographical bridge that the Red Army would have to cross to provide direct physical support in the West.|$|E
25|$|On the mainland, after {{declining in}} {{popularity}} after the 1920s, the Mulian opera revived {{when it was}} listed as a National Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2006. But even supporters in the People's Republic <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> as under threat from high-tech television and films. There are several further challenges. In the past, the opera was passed on orally through family troupes which kept their skills to themselves. However, these troupes no longer exist. The opera is difficult to perform. The ghost roles involve acrobatic skills which require years of training. Since it is a genre that has a small audience, performers require government support. Some observers point to signs for hope, however. While traditional village audiences have dwindled, some film stars and celebrities have taken up the art. Local authorities in Huangshan City, Anhui province, have also promoted performances as a tourist attraction.|$|E
25|$|The god Odin is also {{frequently}} mentioned in surviving texts. One-eyed, wolf and raven-flanked, and spear in hand, Odin pursues knowledge throughout the worlds. In {{an act of}} self-sacrifice, Odin is described as having hanged himself on the cosmological tree Yggdrasil to gain knowledge of the runic alphabet, which he passed on to humanity, and is associated closely with death, wisdom, and poetry. Odin has a strong association with death; Odin is portrayed as the ruler of Valhalla, where valkyries carry half of those slain in battle. Odin's wife is the powerful goddess Frigg who can <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> but tells no one, and together they have a beloved son, Baldr. After a series of dreams had by Baldr of his impending death, his death is engineered by Loki, and Baldr thereafter resides in Hel, a realm ruled over by a goddess of the same name.|$|E

Belle then gives Merlin a book of spells and makes the bars disappear. Merida tells the rescuers that Arthur took the wisps which she needed to find her brothers, so Merlin suggests that they need to come up with another way to find them. When Belle asks Merida why she was in the dungeon, Merida tells her that the wisps led her to the sea, but the boat she hid out in belonged to Arthur, and that when he found her he then threw her in the cell. Merida then knocks Belle out with a rock and hours later Bell awakes to find herself in a rowboat with Merida. Belle learns that Merida needs Belle's magic to find her brothers. She further explained that the clans kidnapped her brothers so they can force her to relinquish the throne as she is not married.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the more}} {{positive}} responses to Chabon's brand of [...] "trickster literature" [...] appeared in Time magazine, whose Lev Grossman wrote that [...] "This is literature in mid-transformation.... he highbrow and the lowbrow, once kept chastely separate, are now hooking up, [...] you can almost <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> of literature coming."

500|$|... is a Pulsian seeress hailing {{from the}} {{city-state}} of Paddra on Gran Pulse {{prior to the}} time of the War of Transgression, having written Analects relating to the event, Etro, Ragnarok, and the Eidolons. In the novel Fragments After, it is shown that Yeul was the first human created, and that for some unknown reason her soul does not fade after reaching the afterlife. Taking pity on her, Etro gives Yeul the ability to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> called the Eyes of Etro, and enables her to be continuously reincarnated throughout history. Though meant for the best, Yeul's ability to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> becomes a curse, since each vision drains her lifeforce and she consequently always dies in her teens. Because of her fate, Caius Ballad, who had seen each Yeul live and die since before the War of Transgression, makes it his goal to destroy Etro and end time itself so Yeul would no longer die. Despite this, Yeul remains supportive of Noel and Serah's quest, and it is later revealed that she allowed herself to be reborn in order to be with Caius. Only one manifestation of Yeul is openly hostile towards the travelers and resentful of her fate. In Lightning Returns, the many versions of Yeul take up residence in the ruins of Etro's temple, with Caius as their guardian. It is revealed that Yeul's constant reincarnation caused her soul to fragment, with each previous life mingled with the Chaos and triggered the events of XIII-2. As the world ends, the souls of Yeul choose to stay and become the new goddess of death to restore the cycle of life Etro established. The final incarnation, who shares a strong bond with Noel and wishes for a new life, is allowed to leave and live as a normal human. Yeul is voiced by Amber Hood in English and Mariya Ise in Japanese.|$|E
500|$|... "Dumpweed" [...] {{kicks off}} the record, and explores sexual frustration. The song is based around the hook [...] "I need a girl that I can train," [...] as in dog training.

[...] The song is a [...] "callow complaint about girls not always doing exactly what you wish they would," [...] and is followed by Hoppus' [...] "Don't Leave Me," [...] a song about a breakup, in irony. Hoppus wrote the song in ten minutes. The guitar swell preceding the second chorus is actually a digital reversal of the delaying guitar preceding it. [...] "Aliens Exist" [...] originates from DeLonge's interest in UFOs and conspiracy theories. [...] "Going Away to College" [...] was written in ten minutes by Hoppus while at home sick on Valentine's Day 1999.

500|$|The {{principal}} {{story begins}} in August 1804, {{with the birth}} of a [...] "modified child" [...] called Imaginos, in the American state of New Hampshire. Because of the astrological significance of the place and time of his birth, Imaginos is of particular interest to Les Invisibles, who begin investing him with superhuman abilities while he is young. Unaware of his true destiny or nature, the young Imaginos finds out that he is apparently able to change his appearance at will and to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> ("Imaginos"). As the child becomes an adult he finds himself affected by wanderlust and, billing himself as an adventurer, sets out to explore Texas and the western frontier, arriving in New Orleans in 1829. It is there that he has a vision imploring him to travel to Mexico in search of an artifact [...] "lost, last and luminous, scored to sky yet never found". Imaginos joins the crew of a ship traveling to the Yucatán Peninsula, but while passing through the Gulf of Mexico, the ship encounters a freak storm of which his visions failed to warn him ("Del Rio's Song"). The ship sinks with most of its crew, and Imaginos, half dead, washes ashore and is left for dead by the other survivors. As he lies dying [...] "on a shore where oyster beds seem plush as down", Imaginos is addressed by a symphony of voices who identify themselves as Les Invisibles. Imaginos' true nature is revealed to him, and he is informed that the circumstances of his entire life have been manipulated to bring him to that specific moment in time. Having explained themselves to him, they offer him a choice – die as a human, or live as their servant ("Blue Öyster Cult"). Imaginos accepts their offer, and is resurrected from the dead by the Blue Öyster Cult, the servants of Les Invisibles. He is inducted into the cult and given a new name - Desdinova, [...] "Eternal Light". He realizes that his descent and the origin of his powers comes from the stars where his masters live and becomes aware of his role in the making of history ("Astronomy").|$|E
