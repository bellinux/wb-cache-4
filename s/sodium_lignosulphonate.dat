In {{order to}} explore size {{formability}} in the molding process of biomass buffer composites and improve quality of foam molding of composites, this paper designed tests of molding make-up and conducted macroscopic characterization to cavity {{flow of the}} size. Test {{results showed that the}} effect sequence of various factors to molding performance of the size is the mass ratio of water>the mass ratio of fibers>the mass ratio of sodium lignosulphonate>the mass ratio of starch. The molding make-up and actual molding are the best when the mass ratio of fibers is 10 %, the mass ratio of water is 50 %, the mass ratio of <b>sodium</b> <b>lignosulphonate</b> is 3 % and the mass ratio of starch is 28 %...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEucalyptus lignin was {{isolated}} from kraft black liquor through acidification by using H 2 SO 4. To effectively utilize black liquor waste from pulp plant, lignin was converted into sulphonated hydroxymethylated phenolized sulphuric acid lignin compound (SHP-SAL), which is soluble in water. SHP-SAL was obtained through {{the sequence of}} (1) phenolation of sulphuric acid lignin (SAL) into phenolized sulphuric acid lignin (P-SAL), (2) hydroxymethylation of P-SAL into hydroxymethylated phenolized sulphuric acid lignin (HP-SAL), and (3) sulphonation of HP-SAL into SHP-SAL. The derived lignin of SHP-SAL characterized by infrared spectrometry showed a significant absorption at 630 cm- 1, which indicates the presence of S−O bond, and absorption at 1118 and 1059 cm- 1, which are characteristics of C−O bonds in lignosulphonates. Assessment of SHP-SAL as a dispersant in gypsum paste was done according to C 230 - 90 ASTM standard. The synthesized SHP-SAL has approximately 60 % higher dispersability than those of commercial <b>sodium</b> <b>lignosulphonate</b> (comm. SLS) and commercial calcium lignosulphonate (comm. CLS). It {{is equal to the}} dispersability of sulphonated naphthalene formaldehyde (SNF), one of the high-performing sulphonate compounds...|$|E
40|$|Water {{management}} {{is an integral}} part of coal mining operations. Due to the constraints on releasing saline water, coal mines require additional water storage facilities and therefore seek to minimise their inventory of saline water. Adopting efficient treatment technologies on-site would minimise the risk of wet season run-offs, freshwater contamination and allow segregation of different qualities of water to enable greater water recycling. This study aims to evaluate the application of an integrated forward osmosis (FO) and reverse osmosis (RO) system with three different actual coal mine waters, containing various concentrations of sulphates and silica that are generally associated with scaling and fouling of membrane systems. Three different FO draw solutions, di-sodium hydrogen phosphate (DHSP), sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) and <b>sodium</b> <b>lignosulphonate</b> (SLS) were evaluated. Two different modes of integrating the FO and RO systems were identified. The integrated system was able to concentrate the brackish mine waters, recovering more than 80 % of the volume of mine water and obtaining dischargeable quality treated water. Simple physical cleaning with clean water circulation was found to be effective in restoring the FO water flux. The osmotic gradient between two mine waters was also utilised to adopt mine water as a draw solution. The effect of solution temperature on stand-alone and integrated FO and RO systems was also evaluated. The combination of FO with RO provided a better performance than individual FO or RO in treating coal mine wastewater. The FO unit served as an effective pre-treatment system prior to RO and the integrated FO–RO systems has a strong potential to successfully eliminate conventional pre-treatment processes for RO...|$|E
40|$|Power {{harvesting}} from thermoelectric generators {{is considered}} as a viable route towards sustainable energy generation by the conversion of thermal gradients occuring naturally or from waste heat sources into useful electrical energy. This thesis investigates the electrodeposition of n-type binary, ternary and doped thermoelectric materials, {{with the aim of}} demonstrating that electrodeposition {{can be used as a}} cost-effective and simple technique to fabricate highly-efficient thermoelectric materials. In order to achieve this, the thermoelectric and electrical properties of such materials must be related to their microstructural properties. Therefore, a detailed and systematic study of their microstructural properties, including morphology, crystal structure, composition and crystallite size, is undertaken whilst also measuring the electrical and thermoelectric properties. It is found that the potential of the working electrode, employed as the substrate during the electrodeposition of bismuth telluride, is one of the most effective variables in the fabrication process. More anodic potentials such as 0 V vs. SCE offer the best microstructural and thermoelectric properties. The addition of a surfactant, <b>sodium</b> <b>lignosulphonate,</b> to the electrolyte further improves the microstructural properties of bismuth telluride thin films, by levelling the deposits and inducing greater crystallographic orientation in growth planes perpendicular to the substrate. This is believed to be preferential for improving thermoelectric properties. The electrodeposition of the ternary thermoelectric material bismuth tellurium selenide shows that the microstructural and hence the thermoelectric and electrical properties of the thin films can be optimised by use of more positive electrode potentials. The thin films fabricated exhibit a thermoelectric efficiency of up to two orders of magnitude greater than similar materials prepared by electrodeposition previously and equal efficiency to those prepared by methods which are more costly and difficult to undertake. Doping these materials with copper, by electrochemical means, further improves the thermoelectric efficiency by over another order of magnitude...|$|E
40|$|More {{than half}} of {{platform}} petrochemicals are aromatic, whereas the only large-scale, naturally-occurring, renewable source of aromatics is lignin. Chemical depolymerization of lignin requires extreme conditions, and results in extensive destruction of the aromatic rings and/or char formation. By contrast, enzymatic lignin depolymerization occurs under mild conditions with retention of the aromatic nuclei. Therefore, laccase from Agaricus bisporus (LAB) and from Trametes versicolor (LTV) with the mediator, ABTS (2, 2 '-azino-bis(3 ethyl benzthiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid)) were used to depolymerize lignin (sodium Iignosulphonate) under mild reaction conditions with the aim to obtain high concentrations of value-added chemicals. The depolymerization {{in the presence of}} LTV was higher than LAB, which resulted from the high catalytic activity of LTV. Lignin degradation resulted in formation of complex product mixtures. Therefore the products were fractionated and analyzed by different analytical techniques including GPC (for preliminary screening), HPLC and GCMS (for product characterization and quantification), and NMR (for fingerprint analysis). Products included guaiacol, vanillin, acetovanillone, vanillic acid, homovanillyl alcohol, phenol, 4 - methyl benzaldehyde, catechol, p-toluic acid, 4 - hydroxybenzaldehyde, tyrosoI, isovaniIIin, and 3 -hydroxy- 1 -(4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenyl) propan- 1 -one, and the total yield of monomers from lignin was 9. 8 % in the presence of LTV. The parameters involved in the depolymerization process were optimized to increase the yield of monomers. The efficiency of laccase mediators was also explored by the use of 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidin- 1 -yloxy (TEMPO), 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT), N-hydroxyphthalimide(HPI) and violuric acid (VLA) in the depolymerization of <b>sodium</b> <b>lignosulphonate.</b> However, the catalytic depolymerization in the presence of these mediators was lower than ABTS. In order to improve the solubility of the substrate for the depolymerization process, screening of ionic liquids that are compatible with LAB was deployed in order to find laccase-friendly ionic liquids for further use in lignin depolymerization. The study has found [C 4 mim] [L-tartrate] as the best ionic liquid tested, that increased the activity of LAB by 90 %. In conclusion, enzymatic depolymerization of lignin offers a greener process than the chemical methods, and also provides a more efficient method to obtain monomers of valuable specialty chemicals under mild reaction conditions...|$|E
