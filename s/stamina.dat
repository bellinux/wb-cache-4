5|$|Both {{the player}} and the {{opponent}} have <b>stamina</b> meters, both {{displayed on the}} top of the screen. The meters decrease when either boxer gets hit by a punch. Boxers will get knocked down if their <b>stamina</b> meter runs out. Faster knockdowns will cause that boxer to recover less <b>stamina</b> upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is knocked down by a knockout punch. Either boxer will lose if they cannot stand up before the count of ten after being knocked down (resulting in a knockout or KO) or if they are knocked down three times in the match (resulting in a technical knockout or TKO). The player can also recover some <b>stamina</b> while the opponent is down by pressing the buttons on the controller.|$|E
5|$|With {{the release}} of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 was the {{inclusion}} of a <b>stamina</b> system, which was a measure of the superstars' <b>stamina.</b> The <b>stamina</b> system was measured by a meter on the HUD; the meter decreased when performing a variety of moves. The meter increases, however, when the player does nothing with the superstar or holds down a selected button that increased the <b>stamina,</b> which varied depending on the player's system. When the superstar's <b>stamina</b> was low, the wrestler reacted by moving slower when performing moves, walking, and running. If the meter decreased completely, the superstar fell to the ground until the meter increased. This system is disabled by default for WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 and was disabled until 2K took over the series, with 2K16.|$|E
5|$|Apu - Apu is a brawler with {{moderate}} strength, but has good speed and <b>stamina.</b>|$|E
5|$|Barney - Barney {{is one of}} the {{stronger}} characters, but lacks speed and <b>stamina.</b> His attacks are based on beer (including throwing beer glasses).|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower is a {{survival}} horror point-and-click adventure game with 2D graphics. The player controls a cursor {{to direct the}} main character, Jennifer Simpson, and give commands such as investigating objects or opening doors. Jennifer can walk and run, although running will reduce her <b>stamina,</b> in which case she may recover her <b>stamina</b> by sitting on the floor. Jennifer's character portrait {{in the corner of}} the screen will change depending on her <b>stamina</b> level. In addition to interacting with objects in the game, Jennifer can also store them as inventory for later use. The layout of items changes with each play-through.|$|E
5|$|Each time a {{successful}} attack is performed on a player, their health meter depletes. Players with low health stay stunned for longer when knocked down. A player can increase their health {{by picking up}} food items that randomly appear in the ring. Running and attacks drain <b>stamina.</b> If a player {{does not have enough}} <b>stamina</b> to perform a certain move, it becomes unavailable until they recover. <b>Stamina</b> is regained through not pressing the actions buttons or picking up certain items. Attacks which require more <b>stamina</b> are generally more effective. The stun meter only appears when the opponent is knocked down. It depletes gradually, but the stunned player cannot move until the Stun meter is completely drained. A player can reduce the stun meter faster by pressing the action buttons, or by receiving certain attacks. If a player is low on health, the stun meter will normally be higher, making pin attempts harder to resist. Once a player's health is completely depleted, it will only take one hit to stun them. Certain attacks to a stunned opponent will actually reset the stun meter.|$|E
5|$|The Atrox is a warrior/tank {{archetype}} {{that have}} excellent strength and <b>stamina</b> but poor intelligence and psychic.|$|E
5|$|The Nanomage {{follows a}} caster {{archetype}} and possess poor strength and <b>stamina,</b> but high intelligence and psychic.|$|E
5|$|The Opifex {{follows a}} {{traditional}} thief/rogue archetype and possess poor <b>stamina</b> and psychic but high agility and sense.|$|E
5|$|A {{security}} guard who discovers he has superhuman levels of strength, <b>stamina,</b> and invulnerability, {{as well as}} an extrasensory ability to see the crimes people have committed by touching them.|$|E
5|$|Between August 2013 and January 2014, Murphy lost 3 stones (42 {{pounds or}} 19kg) in weight, {{due to a}} new diet and fitness regime. He stated {{that one of his}} health and fitness goals was to improve his <b>stamina</b> and {{concentration}} at the table.|$|E
5|$|Haunting Ground is a {{survival}} horror game with similar gameplay elements to Clock Tower 3 (2002). The player controls Fiona Belli directly and gives commands to her canine companion, Hewie. Fiona can run and perform a backstep maneuver, {{both of which}} reduce <b>stamina.</b> She can also crouch down to hide from enemy pursuers. Fiona can kick and tackle enemies as well, but tackling also reduces <b>stamina.</b> Losing too much <b>stamina</b> will result in Fiona becoming exhausted, causing her movements to slow down or possibly stop altogether. Exhaustion can be revived with certain items or with time. Fiona can interact with the environment by checking items, opening doors, and climbing ladders. The player can utilize hiding spots to evade pursuers. Other areas act as retaliation points that allow Fiona to use her environment to counterattack against her enemy, although some of these locations can only be used once.|$|E
5|$|Missouri Fox Trotters {{are used}} {{extensively}} by trail riders, who appreciate their gaits, <b>stamina</b> and weight-carrying abilities. They {{are also used}} in handicapped riding programs, and their smooth gait has proven useful for riders with minor physical disabilities. Crosses between Fox Trotter mares and donkey jacks are often made, creating mules with the fox trot gait {{that are used to}} carry hunters and trail riders, especially in the western United States. The US Forest Service also employs Fox Trotters for their speed, <b>stamina</b> and gait, and members of the breed were used to make the first horse-back descent of the north rim of the Grand Canyon.|$|E
5|$|Norman Osborn {{was turned}} into the Green Goblin by a {{chemical}} solution he had devised based upon a formula originally conceived by Professor Mendel Stromm. The process granted Osborn superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and <b>stamina</b> {{as well as a}} low-level rapid healing factor.|$|E
5|$|Ricky Jarvis (McCulloch) is an obese {{man who has}} {{not left}} his house since he lost a hockey tournament; as {{the captain of the}} town's hockey team, he lost all his <b>stamina</b> in sex with a rival team's {{cheerleader}} the night before the final game.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} {{brings in}} the need to rely upon native flora and fauna to survive. This is manifested in a <b>stamina</b> gauge, which constantly depletes during gameplay. Failure to restore the gauge by eating has detrimental effects on gameplay, such as decreasing Snake's ability to aim his weapon and being heard by the enemy due to Snake's loud stomach grumbles. Food {{can be stored in}} the backpack until it is needed. However, some types of food rot over time, and consuming rotten foods may result in Snake developing a stomach ache, causing the <b>stamina</b> gauge to deplete faster.|$|E
5|$|Among {{both the}} Maguindanao and the Maranao, the agung embodies {{all that is}} {{masculine}} and thus the agung is traditionally considered a masculine instrument. To be considered a good player, one must possess strength, <b>stamina</b> (playing extremely fast tempos with no mistakes) and endurance. Players must also exhibit improvisation skills for different patterns to be considered as having quality musicianship—lest the audience considers the patterns played repetitions and mundane.|$|E
5|$|During the week, David Ian {{talked to}} the girls about fitness and <b>stamina,</b> and Claire Sweeney advised the singers on looking after {{themselves}} and their voices. The mission was a fitness test, with Olympic athlete Iwan Thomas, requiring the Marias to complete an assault course. The Marias also attended the première of the film You, Me and Dupree in Leicester Square.|$|E
5|$|He was a {{relative}} late-comer to competitive running: {{in his late}} teens, scouts from a local athletics club suggested that his cycling <b>stamina</b> might translate to running and invited him to compete. He won the race and was spurred on by the victory to start taking the sport seriously and focus on running. Zersenay was adamant that his early years in cycling {{had given him a}} firm foundation for endurance running.|$|E
5|$|Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 {{hoping to}} study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was {{rejected}} as probably lacking the <b>stamina</b> for a dancing career. While studying at home under a governess for six months, at Whitsun 1921 she took {{part as a}} dancer in a production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Dioclesian, a version largely devised by Joseph.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{gameplay}} mechanics which {{carried over}} from the previous iterations is V.A.T.S. (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System). While using V.A.T.S., real-time combat is slowed, allowing the player to choose where to shoot the enemy: shooting enemies in the head will typically result in death while shooting their legs can slow them. Weapons can also be shot at to disarm the enemy. Using V.A.T.S. lowers the player's <b>stamina</b> (Action Points, or AP). Some actions are unavailable to the player if their <b>stamina</b> is insufficient, {{in which case the}} player has to wait for their AP to regenerate. The use of Power Armor in combat increases {{the rate at which the}} player's AP are used. The Pip-Boy, a small computer strapped to the character's wrist, also plays a role in both Fallout 4 and Far Harbor. It contains a menu which the player can access to view maps, statistics, data, and items, and when the player is able to visit Far Harbor, the Pip-boy will receive a signal from Valentine's Detective Agency.|$|E
5|$|Progression {{towards an}} erect limb posture, which would {{increase}} the animals' <b>stamina</b> by avoiding Carrier's constraint. But this process was slow and erratic: for example, all herbivorous nonmammaliaform therapsids retained sprawling limbs (some late forms may have had semierect hind limbs); Permian carnivorous therapsids had sprawling forelimbs, and some late Permian ones also had semisprawling hindlimbs. In fact, modern monotremes still have semisprawling limbs.|$|E
5|$|The French Spaniel has a {{friendly}} and outgoing personality and is well balanced and patient. It {{is not a}} naturally aggressive dog, is eager to please and thus can be trained easily. A dog of this breed will form a strong bond with its master, being typically a working dog. It has {{a high level of}} <b>stamina</b> and requires vigorous exercise.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{has been}} used to hunt {{pheasant}} and partridge, in both small packs and alone. It is well-suited for work in upland hunting in dense cover, and although the Clumber is rather slow in the field compared to other spaniels, it is a quiet worker with a fine nose and good <b>stamina.</b> The broad muzzle of the breed allows it to retrieve a variety of game.|$|E
5|$|The {{goals of}} Kanō's {{educational}} philosophies and methods (indeed, {{the goals of}} most Japanese educational programs of the early 20th century) were to 1) develop minds, bodies, and spirits in equal proportion, 2) increase patriotism and loyalty, especially to the Emperor, 3) teach public morality, and 4) increase physical strength and <b>stamina,</b> especially {{for the purpose of}} making young men more fit for military service.|$|E
5|$|Their {{movement}} is bold, free and characteristically fast, {{especially at the}} trot, with great power coming from the hocks. Their trot has been favourably {{compared to that of}} the Standardbred horse. They are reputed to be trustworthy, of a good disposition with even temperaments and friendly characters, but spirited and with great endurance, and are known for their <b>stamina,</b> soundness, and high level of intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Throughout gameplay, {{the player}} {{encounters}} various minigames, {{which range from}} simple to more complex. The first type of minigame encountered is a battle sequence that resembles a fighting game, but no interaction from the player is required to fight. These recurring battle sequences represent when {{the members of the}} Little Busters get into physical fights with either each other or with others. Each member of the fight has a set of statistics attributed to them (which includes strength, <b>stamina,</b> agility, reflex, concentration, judgment, and luck) along with a life bar to keep track of how many hit points a fighter has left. The maximum number of hit points is determined by the given fighter's <b>stamina</b> rating. Weapons may be used along with any accessories the fighter has in their possession, and these items may be exchanged with other characters. Another recurring minigame involves the player being able to play baseball batting practice with members of the Little Busters. The player, as Riki, controls his position and when to swing the bat.|$|E
5|$|While the colossi are {{the only}} enemies, there are natural animals in the environment. Only one species, however, has any effect on gameplay: eating {{the tail of a}} certain kind of lizard {{increases}} Wander's <b>stamina</b> gauge. Likewise, the player may find fruit that increases Wander's maximum health.|$|E
5|$|With {{the rise}} of light cavalry, the <b>stamina</b> and agility of horses with Arabian blood gave an {{enormous}} military advantage to any army who possessed them. As a result, many European monarchs began to support large breeding establishments that crossed Arabians on local stock, one example being Knyszyna, the royal stud of Polish king Zygmunt II August, and another the Imperial Russian Stud of Peter the Great.|$|E
5|$|At the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Irvine, California, the Brazilian {{started by}} winning a {{gold in the}} 50-metre butterfly, beating the {{championship}} record. He hoped to also win gold in the 50-metre and 100-metre freestyle, but settled for silver in the 50-metre freestyle, and bronze in the 100-metre freestyle. When interviewed after the contest, Cielo said {{there could have been}} some flaw in his training program, resulting in a lack of <b>stamina.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1899, Warner was {{appointed}} the school's athletic director and his salary more than doubled. A track-and-field program was started that year. Warner knew little about the sport; to prepare as coach he bought every book available and consulted Jack Moakley and Mike Murphy, two of the era's leading head coaches. The program was successful; running was a Native American tradition, and students from the Southwest were known for their <b>stamina</b> in long-distance races.|$|E
5|$|Compared to Final Fantasy XI, where party-based {{gameplay}} is forefront at all times, the gameplay in XIV is adjusted so {{that players}} {{can go for}} longer periods without joining a party. There is no auto-attack option, with each action needing a manual input while an enemy is targeted. Each action uses up a <b>stamina</b> bar. Through defeating monsters, crafting items, and completing quests, players accumulate EXP which, when a certain threshold is reached, automatically increments the player's level. The player's level affects attributes such as HP (health/hit points), MP (magic/mana points), {{and the number of}} abilities available to them.|$|E
5|$|Howard Stark (portrayed by Dominic Cooper) is {{a weapons}} {{developer}} who is framed for selling weapons to America's enemies. One {{of the weapons}} he created during the war was Midnight Oil, designed to give soldiers extra <b>stamina</b> during war, but instead it caused psychosis and led to them killing each other. The U.S. military stole Midnight Oil and used it on the Russians, and Fennhoff blames Stark for the ensuing massacre. Fennhoff hypnotises Stark into bombing New York, but Carter is able to convince Stark to stop. He moves on to set up his own film studio in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{competition}} rules and physical demands, long distance track races {{have much in}} common with middle-distance races, except that pacing, <b>stamina,</b> and race tactics become much greater factors in performances. However, a number of athletes have achieved success in both middle- and long-distance events, including Saïd Aouita who set world records from 1500m to 5000m. The use of pace-setters in long distance events is very common at the elite level, although they are not present at championship level competitions as all qualified competitors want to win.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test {{against the}} West Indies cricket team in Brisbane, Davidson showed his all round skills {{as well as}} <b>stamina</b> in {{becoming}} {{the first player to}} take ten wickets and accumulate more than a hundred runs in a match. On the eve of the match, Davidson broke the little finger on his bowling hand during catching practice and was unable to move it. However, he decided to play after Bradman gave a motivational speech to the team ahead of the match.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{versatile}} hunting dog, used {{for its ability}} to locate and retrieve game in harsh and adverse terrain and conditions. It is not specialised to any one type of terrain, and tends to score well in field trials. The Blue Picardy {{is considered to be a}} quiet breed, but requires a great deal of exercise as it has a high level of <b>stamina.</b> It loves to play, and is a responsive and obedient breed which thrives on human companionship. It is especially good with children.|$|E
