40|$|Lightweight, {{low-cost}} supercapacitors {{with the}} capability of rapidly storing {{a large amount of}} electrical energy can contribute to meeting continuous energy demands and effectively levelling the cyclic nature of renewable energy sources 1. The excellent electrochemical performance of supercapacitors is due to a reversible ion adsorption in porous carbon electrodes. Recently, it was demonstrated that ions from the electrolyte could enter sub nanometre pores, greatly increasing the capacitance 2, 3, 4. However, the molecular mechanism of this enhancement remains poorly understood. Here we provide the first quantitative picture of the structure of an ionic liquid adsorbed inside realistically modelled microporous carbon electrodes. We show how the separation of the positive and negative ions occurs inside the porous disordered carbons, yielding much higher capacitance values (125 [*]F[*]g− 1) than with <b>simpler</b> <b>electrode</b> geometries 5.

30|$|The crystal {{structure}} of the Au–Ag/PAP-modified glassy carbon electrodes was also investigated and their XRD patterns are shown in Fig.  2 d. As can be seen, five characteristic peaks of { 111 }, { 200 }, { 220 }, { 311 }, and { 222 } were, respectively, located at 38.28, 44.34, 64.54, 77.52, and 81.72, indicating an fcc Au–Ag alloy structure [55, 56]. Moreover, the XRD patterns of Au and Ag are completely overlapped since the lattice constants of Au (0.4080  nm) and Ag (0.4086  nm) are almost similar. Therefore, the Au–Ag alloy cannot be distinguished from the XRD powder patterns as monometallic phases [57]. Based on the experimental observations, the peak corresponding to the { 111 } plane is more intense than those to other planes, indicating that the { 111 } plane has the predominant orientation.

40|$|Neutral atoms {{entering}} {{an electric}} field experience a defocusing {{force in the}} dipole field direction, which {{is proportional to the}} field gradient. If an experiment, such as the search for a permanent electron electric dipole moment (eEDM), requires a very strong electric field (13. 5 [*][*]MV/m), then this end-field defocusing results in beam blowup and much reduced phase-space acceptance. In this paper we discuss how these defocusing fields arise from the longitudinal changes in the electric dipole field and their dependence on the electrode shape and spacing between lenses. We find that the end-field defocusing comes from strong impulse forces, whose defocusing power was calculated for <b>simple</b> <b>electrodes</b> with rounded ends. To compensate for this end-field defocusing, a triplet of transverse-focusing lenses was added to the pure dipole field plates in the generic eEDM cesium fountain experiment used to study the neutral beam optics.

40|$|The {{theories}} and expressions of electrochemistry have usually been derived by assuming some <b>simple</b> <b>electrode</b> geometry ensuring homogeneous current distribution along the surface.

One possible way of taking geometrical irregularities into account is to model the surfaces by fractals, whose most obvious feature is their blow-up symmetry. A number of theories exist for various electrochemical situations involving electrodes of irregular, fractal, geometries; two groups of are important as archetypes. The subject of the first is the frequency dependence of the impedance of a system comprised of a capacitive electrode of fractal geometry and a resistive electrolyte. The second is the time-dependence of the diffusional flux to an electrode of fractal geometry following an electrode potential jump making the electrode initially inactive to become reactive.

40|$|Electrical methods offer a {{geophysical}} {{approach for}} determining the sub-bottom distribution of hydrate in deep marine environments. Methane hydrate is essentially non-conductive. Hence, sediments containing hydrate are more resistive than sediments without hydrates. To date, the controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) method {{has been used in}} marine hydrates studies. This project evaluated an alternative electrical method, direct current resistivity (DCR), for detecting marine hydrates. DCR involves the injection of direct current between two source electrodes and the simultaneous measurement of the electric potential (voltage) between multiple receiver electrodes. The DCR method provides subsurface information comparable to that produced by the CSEM method, but with less sophisticated instrumentation. Because the receivers are <b>simple</b> <b>electrodes,</b> large numbers can be deployed to achieve higher spatial resolution. In this project a prototype seafloor DCR system was developed and used to conduct a reconnaissance survey at a site of known hydrate occurrence in Mississippi Canyon Block 118. The resulting images of sub-bottom resistivities indicate that high-concentration hydrates at the site occur only in the upper 50 m, where deep-seated faults intersect the seafloor.
