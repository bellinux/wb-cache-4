500|$|Some desert plants produce seed {{which lies}} dormant {{in the soil}} until sparked into growth by rainfall. When annuals, such plants grow with great rapidity and may flower and set seed within weeks, aiming to {{complete}} their development before the last vestige of water dries up. For perennial plants, reproduction {{is more likely to}} be successful if the seed germinates in a shaded position, but not so close to the parent plant as to be in competition with it. Some seed will not germinate until it has been blown about on the desert floor to <b>scarify</b> the seed coat. The seed of the mesquite tree, which grows in deserts in the Americas, is hard and fails to sprout even when planted carefully. When it has passed through the gut of a pronghorn it germinates readily, and the little pile of moist dung provides an excellent start to life well away from the parent tree. [...] The stems and leaves of some plants lower the surface velocity of sand-carrying winds and protect the ground from erosion. Even small fungi and microscopic plant organisms found on the soil surface (so-called cryptobiotic soil) can be a vital link in preventing erosion and providing support for other living organisms. Some plants, including the Plantago Lanceolata, have to reproduce via wind pollination due to living in the environment. Cold deserts often have high concentrations of salt in the soil. Grasses and low shrubs are the dominant vegetation here and the ground may be covered with lichens. Most shrubs have spiny leaves and shed them in the coldest part of the year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- A {{study was}} {{conducted}} at the University of Agriculture, Makurdi, to determine water uptake at 6 and 12 hour intervals, and germination characteristics of <b>scarified</b> and non <b>scarified</b> seeds of castor bean accessions in 2008 and 2009. Two hundred seeds were selected from each accession: one hundred seeds were <b>scarified</b> mechanically by caruncle removal using knife (seed lot 1), one hundred seeds were not <b>scarified</b> (seed lot 2). Each seed lot was immersed in 10 ml of distilled water contained in 9 cm-diameter petridish. Thereafter, seed lots were weighed at every 6 h starting from 0 to 24 h, and at every 12 h up to 108 h. Water uptake in <b>scarified</b> and non <b>scarified</b> seeds was determined by seed mass increase, and expressed as percentage increase in mass of seeds. Germination test of two hundred seeds of each accession was done by planting seeds 2 cm deep in moist sandy loam soil contained in plastic containers to determine germination characteristics. Results showed that the weight and percentage weight increase of seeds at 6 and 12 hour intervals were significantly higher in <b>scarified</b> seeds than in non <b>scarified</b> seeds. <b>Scarified</b> seeds attained maximum saturation at 60 h and non <b>scarified</b> seeds at 84 h. <b>Scarified</b> and non <b>scarified</b> seeds differed significantly in water uptake and germination characteristics at 6 and 12 hour intervals, being higher in <b>scarified</b> seeds. Mechanical scarification improved water uptake, germination characteristics and the planting value of seeds.

40|$|Small-scale soil {{scarification}} under canopies {{has been}} proposed to remove regeneration inhibitor plants that often dominate the understory in natural forests after selection logging. We studied the impacts of the small-scale soil scarification on carabid beetle assemblages in conifer hardwood mixed forests in northern Japan. We sampled carabid beetles using pitfall traps in <b>scarified</b> sites and adjacent unscarified sites two and four years after scarification. Forest species made up 98 % of the total catch {{with only a few}} individuals of non-forest species occurring in <b>scarified</b> sites. Species richness of forest species did not differ significantly between <b>scarified</b> and unscarified sites, whereas species richness of non-forest species was higher in <b>scarified</b> sites than in unscarified sites. Carabid species composition differed between <b>scarified</b> and unscarified sites in each of the two study years. Dissimilarity measures between <b>scarified</b> and adjacent unscarified sites were smaller after four years than after two years, indicating that differences in species composition associated with scarification declined during the study period. Some forest species were more abundant in <b>scarified</b> sites, whereas other forest species were more abundant in unscarified sites. Our results suggest that small-scale scarification may have a limited impact on carabid beetle diversity...|$|R

40|$|G. Don (Cucurbitaceae) is {{an annual}} weed that disperses dormant seeds. The {{influence}} of scarification and light on their germination was {{studied in the}} laboratory. <b>Scarified</b> seeds collected in 1987, 6, 7, 8, and 9 mo postharvest, gave high germination both in white light (89 to 100 %) and darkness (64 to 96 %), in comparison with nonscarified seeds which germinated 7 to 20 % in both conditions. <b>Scarified</b> seeds collected in 1989, 3 mo postharvest, germinated higher (52 to 69 %) than nonscarified seeds (0 to 5 %).

40|$|Water uptake {{kinetics}} of axes and cotyledons of Vigna radiata seeds {{has been}} studied during incubation at chilling temperature (4 °C) and under cycloheximide treatment. Germination rate of <b>scarified</b> seeds was faster than intact seeds, which can be correlated with their comparative water uptake kinetics. Chilling temperature during incubation significantly slowed down water uptake by both intact and <b>scarified</b> seeds. Treatment with cycloheximide was also somewhat effective in retarding water uptake, but only in <b>scarified</b> seeds. Water uptake by axes isolated from intact seeds (attached or detached from the cotyledons) was inhibited completely by chilling temperature {{as well as by}} cycloheximide treatment while these treatments were ineffective in preventing water uptake by cotyledons. In the case of <b>scarified</b> seeds, such treatments again inhibited water uptake by axes only, the effect being more prominent in attached ones.

6000|$|Though a {{reaction}} against the Whigs was beginning, propaganda was needed to disabuse the public of two anxieties--that {{there was still a}} danger that Roman Catholicism might be restored and that the three dissolutions might foreshadow a return to unparliamentary government such as Charles I had established from 1629 to 1640, also after three dissolutions. The royal party was at first on the defensive. Their propaganda began with a proclamation issued on April 8 and ordered to be read in all churches. In the proclamation the King posed as the champion of law and order against a disloyal faction trying to overthrow the constitution. It was read in churches on April 17 and, according to Luttrell's Brief Historical Relation (I, 77), [...] "in many places was not very pleasing, but afforded matter of sport to some persons." [...] Among several replies was one entitled A Letter from a Person of Quality to his Friend. Clearly there was need to answer this pamphlet and to state more fully the case against the Whigs. This task was undertaken by two of the greatest writers of English prose--George Savile, then Earl, later Marquis of Halifax, and John Dryden. Halifax, in the tract lately identified as his by Hugh Macdonald (Cambridge, 1940), Observations upon a late Libel--though he might <b>scarify</b> an individual opponent like Shaftesbury or pour ridicule upon a sentence from A Letter, set himself the task of answering the Whig case as a whole.

50|$|Thatch is a {{build-up}} {{of organic}} matter which can include dead grass, leaves, stems, stolons, rhizomes and overcrowded grass roots and lateral weed growth. Thatch can stifle the growth and health of grass or turf. Removing the thatch helps the grass by encouraging it to thicken up and also makes it stronger and less susceptible to disease. Reducing thatch levels increases the levels of water, air and nutrients that can get through to the root zone of the grass plants. Significant thatch problems in lawns can cause diseases and can encourage moss {{to grow in the}} areas where grass has died. A by-product of <b>scarifying</b> or de-thatching is that moss is also removed, and depending on how deep the <b>scarifying</b> blades are set, root cutting can also occur, and this in turn helps grass to thicken up over time. <b>Scarifying</b> is normally carried out in autumn or spring.

40|$|Mimosa bimucronota is a {{pioneering}} tree that occurs predominantly in moist lowlands, floodplains and on margins of {{rivers and lakes}} in Latin America. the effect of submergence on seed germination in M. bimucronata was firstly studied.

Submergence duration did not significantly affect germination percentages of <b>scarified</b> and unscarified seeds. Therefore, seed viability after submersion suggests that M. bimucronata may display hydrochorous dispersal and also that seeds are able to germinate successfully in areas with frequent seasonal flooding. With respect to imbibition phases, phase II was very short or even absent for <b>scarified</b> and unscarified seeds; therefore, a plateau, where water absorption by seeds is established, was not observed. Finally, we verified that the passage from phase I to III was very tenuous {{and took a long}} time in seeds without scarification. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
