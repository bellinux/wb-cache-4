This article concludes that the EPA 2 ̆ 7 s creation of a low-risk subcategory of PCWP sources is improper because the plain language of <b>subsection</b> 112 (c) (<b>9)</b> (B) (i) limits the Agency 2 ̆ 7 s delisting authority to whole categories of carcinogenic sources. The EPA has failed to meet its heavy burden in attempting to demonstrate that Congress made a drafting error when it omitted the term 2 ̆ 2 subcategory 2 ̆ 2 in <b>subsection</b> 112 (c) (<b>9)</b> (B) (i) for carcinogenic chemicals. The doctrine of scrivener 2 ̆ 7 s error is inapplicable to the plain language of <b>subsection</b> 112 (c) (<b>9)</b> (B) (i). There are plausible reasons why Congress would have used the term 2 ̆ 2 subcategory 2 ̆ 2 in <b>subsection</b> 112 (c) (<b>9)</b> (B) (ii) for non-carcinogenic chemicals that were assumed to have a safe threshold but deliberately omitted the term 2 ̆ 2 subcategory 2 ̆ 2 in <b>subsection</b> 112 (c) (<b>9)</b> (B) (i) for carcinogenic chemicals that were assumed in 1990 to have no safe threshold other than zero emissions.

40|$|Introduction The {{motivation}} of digital simulation of artificial neural networks is {{as diverse as}} the background of the researchers. Biologists, mathematicians, physicists, psychologists, computer scientists or engineers, all contribute to the field of neural networks. In one case, a very complex model of a single neuron has to be simulated. In another case, a large network of usually simpler neurons must be taken care of. Due to programmability, digital hardware offers a high degree of flexibility and provides a platform for simulations on neuron level as well as on network level. In opposite to signals in nature, digital signals are discrete in value and in time. Therefore, for digital simulations a suitable neuron model needs to be derived. Hence, at first we examine the digital representations of spiking neuron models in <b>subsection</b> <b>9.</b> 2. Then, <b>subsection</b> <b>9.</b> 3 gives an overview of programming environments.

40|$|Chaplygin [9] {{proved the}} integrability by quadratures of a round sphere, rolling without {{slipping}} on a horizontal plane, with {{center of mass}} {{at the center of}} the sphere, but with arbitrary moments of inertia. Although the system is integrable in every sense of the word, it neither arises as a Hamiltonian system, nor is the integrability an immediate consequence of the symmetries. On the other hand, the constants of motion are obtained as a consequence of Noether’s principle, cf. Section 1 and 2. The system also turns out to be related to a Hamiltonian system, the geodesic flow on the Euclidean motion group for a left invariant metric, cf. <b>Subsection</b> <b>9.</b> 3. In this paper we analyse the global dynamics of Chaplygin’s sphere. In the process we will explain almost all of Chaplygin’s results. Readers who are mainly interested in these may consult Sections 1, 2, 3, 7, Subsections 9. 2, 11. 2, 11. 3, 11. 5, and Section 12. These can be read independently from the rest of the paper with some exceptions, such as <b>Subsection</b> <b>9.</b> 2 in which <b>Subsection</b> <b>9.</b> 1 has been used. At the end of each section we describe in a subsection ”Chaplygin ” the relation between our text and Chaplygin’s. We also obtain some new results, such as the proof in Section 4 that the level sets of the constants of motion in the reduced phase space are two-dimensional tori. In Section 8 we prove that, after a suitable time reparametrization, the rotational motion is quasi-periodic on two-dimensional tori. After suitable completion of the level surfaces, this is also true for the complexified system, cf. Section 10. This shows that the rotational motion is algebraically integrable according to the definition of Adler and van Moerbeke. In Subsection 11. 4 it is explained how this also follows, in a quite different way, from Chaplygin’s integration in terms of hyperelliptic integrals. 1 Noether’s Principle for Nonholomic Systems We use the equations of motion for a system with nonholonomic constraints as given by d’Alembert’s principle 〈[L] γ (t), v 〉 = 0 for every v ∈ Cγ(t), (1. 1) A large part of this work has been done during a sabbatical leave in Berkeley, in the fall of 1994, partially supported by AFOSR Contract AFO F 49629 - 92.

40|$|This is {{the first}} paper in a series which proposes and {{develops}} the polyfold Fredholm structure [...] Kuranishi structure correspondence, identifying these two abstract perturbative structures which are indispensable for constructing and understanding symplectic invariants in the most general settings. In this paper, I present my version {{of the theory of}} Kuranishi structures in full generality. This theory is independent of all the choices made in the construction (including the choices of good coordinate systems); and it uses the equivalence of Kuranishi structures as the germ to capture the intrinsic underlying structure to which the perturbation theory descends. This {{is the first}} theory in the literature that has these two properties. This choice-independent theory is essential for canonically and functorially identifying the polyfold Fredholm theory of Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder with the theory of Kuranishi structures. The next two papers in this series will be on the forgetful functor and the globalization functor in the respective directions of the polyfold [...] Kuranishi correspondence, as well as illustrating the use of the correspondence with a few sample applications. Comment: 127 pages, 17 figures; in <b>subsection</b> <b>9.</b> 3, added an explicit construction of Kuranishi embeddings into the fiber product good coordinate system, and made changes to have the fiber product square property, although the bottom-left half of the square is not used later; and made some minor change...|$|E
40|$|On a {{suitable}} category of formal schemes equipped with codimension functions we construct a canonical pseudofunctor (-) ^# taking {{values in the}} corresponding categories of Cousin complexes. Cousin complexes on such a formal scheme X functorially represent derived-category objects F by the local cohomologies H_x^codim(x) (F) (x ∈ X) together with "residue maps" from the cohomology at x to that at each immediate specialization of x; this representation is faithful when restricted to F which are Cohen-Macaulay (CM), i. e., H_x^i(F) = 0 unless i=codim(x). Formal schemes {{provide a framework for}} treating local and global duality as aspects of a single theory. One motivation has been {{to gain a better understanding}} of the close relation between local properties of residues and global variance properties of dualizing complexes (which are CM). Our construction, depending heavily on local phenomena, is inspired by, but generalizes and makes more concrete, that of the classical pseudofunctor (-) ^Δ taking values in residual complexes, on which the proof of Grothendieck's (global) Duality Theorem in Hartshorne's "Residues and Duality" is based. Indeed, it is shown in a subsequent paper by Sastry that (-) ^# is a good concrete approximation to the fundamental duality pseudofunctor (-) ^!. The pseudofunctor (-) ^# takes residual complexes to residual complexes, so contains a canonical representative of (-) ^Δ; and it generalizes as well several other functorial (but not pseudofunctorial) constructions of residual complexes which appeared in the 1990 s.

The main struc­ tural difference {{is that all the}} material on the theory of finite noncooperative games has been collected in Chapter 2, with renumbering of the material of the remain­ ing chapters. New sections have been added in this chapter: devoted to general questions of equilibrium theory in nondegenerate games, <b>subsections</b> 3. <b>9</b> - 3. 17, by N. N. Vorob'ev, Jr.; and § 4, by A. G. Chernyakov; and § 5, by N. N. Vorob'ev, Jr., on the computational complexity of the process of finding equilibrium points in finite games. It should also be mentioned that subsections 3. 12 - 3. 14 in Chapter 1 were written by E. B. Yanovskaya especially for the Russian edition. The author regrets that the present edition does not reflect the important game-theoretical achievements presented in the splendid monographs by E. van Damme (on the refinement of equilibrium principles for finite games), as well as those by J. e. Harsanyi and R. Selten, and by W. Giith and B. Kalkofen (on equilibrium selection). When the Russian edition was being written, these direc­ tions in game theory had not yet attained their final form, which appeared only in quite recent monographs; the present author has had to resist the temptation of attempting to produce an elementary exposition of the new theories for the English edition; readers of this edition will find only brief mention of the new material...|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} several years, Marquette University has been {{conducting}} a research study for WisDOT on tining patterns to reduce the objectionable tire/pavement whine. During the research study, WisDOT issued Construction Notes to implement the interim results of the research rather than tine the pavement according to <b>Subsection</b> 415. 5. <b>9.</b> 6. 3 of the Standard Specifications. In the completed study, Marquette University has determined that a skewed, randomly spaced, transversely tined surface results in the lowest levels of pavement whine while retaining the favorable friction characteristics achieved under the current specifications. The overall noise level is not reduced by skewed randomly tined surfaces. The research study wasn’t completed in time to include the recommended tining requirements in the bidding documents for 2001 construction projects. However, Wisconsin Concrete Pavement Association (WCPA) members {{are aware of the}} findings of the research study. All WCPA member contractors are intending to use the randomly spaced tining rake, meeting the study recommendations, during the 2001 construction season. Therefore, WisDOT is implementing the research study recommendations on randomly spaced rake for the 2001 construction season with this Construction Note...|$|R
40|$|Let X and Y be bounded self-adjoint {{operators}} on a Hilbert space H. The paper {{deals with}} the following well known problem: if the commutator [X, Y] is small in an appropriate sense, is there a pair of commuting operators ˜ X and ˜ Y which are close to X and Y? Note that for general bounded operators X and Y {{it is not necessarily}} true (see <b>Subsection</b> B. <b>9).</b> For self-adjoint X and Y, taking A: = X + iY, one can reformulate the question as follows: if the self-commutator [A∗, A] is small, is there a normal operator Ã close to A? There are some positive results in this direction. Probably, the most famous is the Brown–Douglas–Fillmore theorem [BDF]. Theorem 0. 1. If H is separable, [A ∗, A] is compact and the corresponding to A element of the Calkin algebra has trivial index function then there is a compact operator K such that A + K is normal. Another is due to Huaxin Lin [L 3]. Theorem 0. 2. There exists a continuous function F: [0, ∞) ↦ → [0, 1] vanishing at the origin such that the distance from A to the set of normal operators is estimated by F(‖[A ∗, A]‖) for all finite rank operators A with ‖A ‖ � 1. Our main result is Theorem 2. 12, which shows that a bounded operator A belongs to a certain set associated with its self-commutator whenever A − λI can be approximated by invertible operators for all λ ∈ C. Theorem 2. 12 implies both the BDF and Huaxin Lin’s theorems. Moreover, it allows us to refine the former and to extend the latter to operators of infinite rank and other norms (see Corollaries 2. 10, 2. 14, 3. 3 and Remark 2. 11). In particular, we obtain an analogue of Huaxin Lin’s theorem for the Schatten norms of finite matrices (see Subsection 3. 3). Theorem 2. 12 holds for any unital C ∗-algebra L of real rank zero, but in the general case we need a slightly stronger condition on A. Namely, we assume that A − λI belong to the closure of the connected component of unity in the set of invertible elements in L for all λ ∈ C. Our proof of Theorem 2. 12 uses the C ∗-algebra technique developed in [FR 1] and [FR 2] and cannot be significantly simplified by assuming that L is the C ∗-algebra of all bounde...|$|R
