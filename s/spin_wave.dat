We show that the gapless spectrum of <b>spin</b> <b>waves,</b> describing the <b>spin</b> precession {{in the absence of}} the applied magnetic field, changes sign to negative on the paramagnetic side near the ferromagnet - paramagnet phase transition. The damping of <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> is small in the limit when electron-electron exchange energy is larger than the inverse electron mean free time, while in the opposite limit the propagation of <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> is strongly suppressed.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{observation}} of reverse Doppler effect in backward <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> reflected off of surface acoustic <b>waves.</b> The <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> are excited in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film. Simultaneously, acoustic waves are also generated. The strain induced by the acoustic waves in the magnetostrictive YIG film results in the periodic modulation of the magnetic anisotropy in the film. Thus, in effect, a travelling Bragg grating for the <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> is produced. The backward <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> reflecting off of this grating exhibit a reverse Doppler shift: shifting down rather than up in frequency when reflecting off of an approaching acoustic <b>wave.</b> Similarly, the <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> are shifted up in frequency when reflecting from receding acoustic waves.

50|$|A magnonic crystal is a {{magnetic}} metamaterial with alternating magnetic properties. Like conventional metamaterials, their properties arise from geometrical structuring, {{rather than their}} bandstructure or composition directly. Small spatial inhomogeneities create an effective macroscopic behaviour, leading to properties not readily found in nature. By alternating parameters such as the relative permeability or saturation magnetisation, there exists the possibility to tailor 'magnonic' bandgaps in the material. By tuning {{the size of this}} bandgap, only <b>spin</b> <b>wave</b> modes able to cross the bandgap would be able to propagate through the media, leading to selective propagation of certain <b>spin</b> <b>wave</b> frequencies.|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} of propagating <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> in micron-sized metallic ferromagnetic structures {{has been the}} subject of theoretical and experimental studies [1 – 3] due to their potential application in microwave signal processing and spin-wave logic devices [6, 10], but also due to the possibility to address basic physical phenomena related to the spin transfer torque [11, 12] and the interaction of <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> with topological objects like domain walls [13 – 15, 19]. In all experimental studies the understanding of the excitation and propagation of <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> is of vital importance, especially for the exploration of next-generation logic circuits which would use the phase and amplitude of the <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> as an information carrier [6, 7, 10]. As the processing of data in these devices is performed by the interference of the different input waves, the ability of the <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> to form stable and predictable interference patterns is of crucial importance. Consequently, several numerical studies [4, 8] were dedicated to the interference of <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> in microstructures but the experimental proofs are still limited (see e. g. [21]). In this report we present the experimental observation of interfering <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> in micron-sized waveguides of Ni 81 Fe 19 (see Fig. 1 a) for detailed sample design).

50|$|However, {{these two}} {{visualizations}} leave some ambiguity.

In the first case, the magnon is envisioned as a quasiparticle, in the second case, as a collective excitation. However, both (a) and (b) are equivalent and correct descriptions. As this example shows, the intuitive distinction between a quasiparticle and a collective excitation is not particularly important or fundamental.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{generation}} and confinement of short-wavelength <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> in a continuous film with periodically modulated magnetic anisotropy. The concept, which is demonstrated for strain-coupled Co 40 Fe 40 B 20 /BaTiO 3 heterostructures, relies on abrupt rotation of magnetic anisotropy at the boundaries of magnetic stripe domains. In combination with an external bias field, this modulation of magnetic anisotropy produces a lateral variation of the effective magnetic field, leading to local spin-wave excitation when irradiated by a microwave magnetic field. In domains with small effective field, <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> are perfectly confined by the spin gap in neighboring domains. In contrast, standing <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> in domains with large effective field radiate into neighboring domains. Using micromagnetic simulation, we show that the wavelength of emitted <b>spin</b> <b>waves</b> is tunable from a few micrometers down to about 100 nm by rotation of the bias field.
