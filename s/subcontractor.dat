5|$|As {{part of the}} US Department of Labor’s (DOL) governmentwide {{implementation}} of the Davis-Bacon Act, federal regulations require that all laborers and mechanics who work for a contractor or <b>subcontractor</b> on federally financed construction contracts over $2,000 must be paid wages not less than those the DOL established for the project location (i.e., the prevailing wage). This Compliance Requirement was created to assure that recipients oblige contractors {{to comply with the}} Davis-Bacon Act, by including in their construction contracts with a contractor or <b>subcontractor</b> a clause or requirement to comply with the Davis-Bacon Act and the DOL regulations. The clause should also include a requirement for the contractor or <b>subcontractor</b> to submit to the recipient weekly (e.g., for each week in which any contract work is performed) a copy of the construction payroll accompanied by statement of compliance. This report is commonly referred to as “certified payrolls”, and is often done using Optional Form WH-347 (OMB No. 1215-0149), a standard form pre-designed by the OMB.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{findings}} of a survey carried out in 1995 among Turkish <b>subcontractors,</b> the present paper argues that pressures (time, overload of work and commercial considerations) {{play an important role in}} the subcontracting of work by <b>subcontractors</b> to secondary <b>subcontractors.</b> The tendency to sublet work to secondary <b>subcontractors</b> is associated with cost control and payment problems. <b>Subcontractors</b> also seem to perceive the lack of written agreements with secondary <b>subcontractors</b> as problematic, especially in terms of physical progress of work.

40|$|Up till now, most {{research}} on the selection of <b>subcontractors</b> in construction projects {{has focused on the}} factors considered by the main (general) contractors. The goal {{of this study is to}} identify the factors that other main stakeholders, namely clients and consultants, believe should be taken into account when selecting <b>subcontractors.</b> The paper presents the results of a survey of experts from various backgrounds in the construction industry and conducts a comparative study of their perspectives in factors that should be considered in selecting <b>subcontractors.</b> The results of the survey show that there are similarities and dissimilarities between perceptions of respondents with different background. For example, nearly all the respondents identified <b>subcontractor’s</b> past experience in similar projects and <b>subcontractor’s</b> available resources, as the most important factors that should be considered in selecting <b>subcontractors.</b> However, while respondents from contractor organizations identified the lowest bid as one of the most important factors, those from consultant and client organizations identified <b>subcontractor’s</b> safety record, compliance with project schedule, and safety programs and past safety record as their top considerations in selecting <b>subcontractors.</b> The paper provides an extensive statistical analysis to identify the impact of stakeholder’s background on their perspective in the importance of factors that should be considered in selecting <b>subcontractors</b> and discusses the similarities and dissimilarities in their perspectives...|$|R
30|$|Even {{though more}} stable {{graduated}} debts and cost allocation were built through the social time mechanism, the upstream material suppliers or the households upstream still occasionally encountered capital shortage due to accidents. These financial needs possibly emerged because payment from the downstream <b>subcontractors</b> {{did not occur}} before the capital settlement period based on social time or because the daily expenses exceeded the payments advanced by the <b>subcontractors.</b> In {{order to keep the}} upstream alive, the downstream <b>subcontractors</b> were obliged to support the upstream, forming a countervailing mechanism between the <b>subcontractors</b> and the households as well as between the <b>subcontractors</b> and material suppliers, that is, resolving the capital shortage by debts or loans.|$|R

5|$|After {{securing}} {{additional financing}} from Eurimages and ARTE, Tarr used these and the Hungarian funds to undertake nine days of shooting on sets {{he had built}} {{at a cost of}} €2 million. The French funding was cross-financed for the shoot by T. T. Filmműhely. As funds were frozen however, the Corsican <b>subcontractor</b> Tanit Films (controlled by the film's then-executive producer Jean-Patrick Costantini), terminated their contract with Balsan and through legal action compelled the production to dismantle the sets and leave the shooting location. At that point, Ognon Pictures shut the production down and disassociated themselves from the film, and Tarr withdrew to Hungary to regroup.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81 was {{launched}} on 5 March 1981 in two versions (though with identical components) – a pre-assembled machine or a cheaper kit version, which the user could assemble himself. Both versions were manufactured in Dundee, Scotland by Timex Corporation at the company's Dryburgh factory. Timex {{had not been}} an obvious choice of manufacturing <b>subcontractor,</b> as the company had little previous experience in assembling electronics. It was a well-established manufacturer of mechanical watches but was facing a crisis {{at the beginning of}} the 1980s. Profits had dwindled to virtually zero as the market for mechanical watches stagnated in the face of competition from the digital and quartz watches. Recognising the trend, Timex's director, Fred Olsen, determined that the company would diversify into other areas of business.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose to}} develop a {{framework}} for agent-based electronic markets (e-markets) for project supply chain coordination, where <b>subcontractors</b> interact and transact with other <b>subcontractors</b> within supply-chain networks {{with the assistance of}} software agents. The e-markets for project supply chain coordination complements our agent-based project schedule coordination framework by applying the advanced transaction techniques developed for electronic commerce systems. According to external changes, <b>subcontractors</b> trade not only their timing with other <b>subcontractors</b> through multi-agent negotiation, but also their tasks with the same specialty contractors, which may be in better positions to execute the tasks, through e-markets. The multi-agent decision-support system will help <b>subcontractors</b> explore various new choices and opportunities that the e-markets offer. The business-to-business e-markets support the current project coordination trends in which subcontracting or [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The {{incentive}} to hire <b>subcontractors</b> is either {{to reduce costs}} or to mitigate project risks. In this way, the general contractor receives the same or better service than the general contractor could have provided by itself, at lower overall risk. Many <b>subcontractors</b> do work for the same companies rather than different ones. This allows <b>subcontractors</b> to further specialize their skills.|$|R
40|$|In the {{construction}} industry, projects {{are becoming increasingly}} large and complex, involving multiple <b>subcontractors.</b> Traditional centralized coordination techniques used by the general contractors become insufficient as <b>subcontractors</b> perform most work and provide their own resources. When <b>subcontractors</b> cannot provide enough resources, they hinder their own performance {{as well as that}} of other <b>subcontractors</b> and ultimately the entire project. Thus, projects need a new distributed coordination approach wherein all of the concerned <b>subcontractors</b> can respond to changes and reschedule a project dynamically. This paper presents a new distributed coordination framework for project schedule changes (DCPSC) based on an agent-based negotiation approach wherein software agents on behalf of the human <b>subcontractors</b> evaluate the impact of changes, simulate decisions, and give advice. A case example demonstrates the significance of the DCPSC. It compares two centralized coordination methodologies used in current practice to the DCPSC framework. We demonstrate that our DCPSC framework always finds a solution that is better than or equal to any of two centralized coordination methodologies...|$|R
5|$|In August 1981 {{the program}} {{received}} a boost when British Aerospace (BAe) and McDonnell Douglas signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), marking the UK's re-entry into the program. The British government was enticed by the lower cost of acquiring Harriers promised {{by a large}} production run, {{and the fact that}} the US was shouldering the expense of development. Under the agreement BAe was relegated to the position of a <b>subcontractor,</b> instead of the full partner status that would have been the case had the UK not left the program. Consequently, the company received, in man-hours, 40 percent of the airframe work-share. Aircraft production took place at McDonnell Douglas' facilities in suburban St. Louis, Missouri, and manufacturing by BAe at its Kingston and Dunsfold facilities in Surrey, England. Meanwhile, 75 percent work-share for the engine went to Rolls-Royce, which had previously absorbed Bristol Siddeley, with the remaining 25 percent assigned to Pratt & Whitney. The two companies planned to manufacture 400 Harrier IIs, with the USMC expected to procure 336 aircraft and the RAF, 60.|$|E
5|$|The French, German and Hungarian co-production of {{the film}} was fraught with {{difficulty}} and obstacles. The first of these was the suicide in February 2005, days before shooting was due to begin, {{of the film}}'s French producer, Humbert Balsan. As the original financing of the film collapsed, the remaining producers managed to secure stop-gap funding which allowed them to shoot nine days of footage on the expensive Corsican sets, until they were shut down through legal action by the local <b>subcontractor.</b> After many expressions of support from European film organisations, production companies and government bodies, a new co-production contract was signed in July 2005 with a revised budget and shooting schedule. It then emerged that all rights to the film had been ceded to a French bank under the original production agreement, and only after further changes in the film's backers was a deal struck with the bank to allow shooting to resume in March 2006, over a year later than had been originally envisaged.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in the newspaper Fremover (Narvik, Norway), in May 1994, the English aviation engineer Hugh Tyrer stated that the cause of the accident was probably due to fatigue in the end piece of the transfer mechanism to the elevator. The end piece was in such a state that it would have failed sooner or later in ordinary use. Following this discovery in the wreck, Widerøe had grounded all their Twin Otters and checked these pieces, but without finding any other defect parts. de Havilland Canada had also sent an alert to all operators of the Twin Otter to check the component, and had canceled the contract with the <b>subcontractor.</b> On 800 operating Twin Otters, 86 end pieces were replaced shortly after the accident, although none had fatigue similar to that of LN-BNS. The commission's chair, Ragnar Rygnestad, stated that they had not considered the end piece {{to be part of the}} cause of the accident, and that they therefore had not stress-tested it or the elevator to see what forces were needed to cause a crack. Rygnestad stated that the board knew about the fatigue. He also said that he had no problems with the opening of a new inquiry. Widerøe stated that they trusted the report from the Accident Investigation Board.|$|E
40|$|<b>Subcontractors</b> perform {{most of the}} {{construction}} works and their effect on industry are apparent in different activities of construction. Therefore, <b>subcontractors</b> need more attention from government and contractors union. The aim {{of this paper is}} to identify, evaluate, and rank factors that influence safety performance of <b>subcontractors</b> in the Gaza Strip (Palestine) according to their relative importance. The study concluded that reported accident rates will decrease among <b>subcontractors</b> and their workers if new workers are trained well in the work site and they are informed about dangerous places, and if a workable safety plan is well preplanned. The results also showed that reported accident rates increased among <b>subcontractors</b> when using old, unsafe equipment and due to the complexity or difficulty in {{the construction}} sites features. Owners and general contractors need to stipulate strict clauses for safety in the contract for improving safety record of <b>subcontractors.</b> Construction workers must receive proper job related safety and health training with a safety logbook. It is recommended that the <b>subcontractors</b> and workers should attend continuing safety programs on regular basis as part of their perquisite to work in construction sites...|$|R
40|$|<b>Subcontractors</b> {{handle a}} major portion—about 85 %—of all {{construction}} {{projects in the}} building industry. The ability of the main contractor and consultants to deliver the project within time, quality and cost targets depends largely {{on the performance of}} the <b>subcontractors.</b> Selection of <b>subcontractors</b> on the basis of overall ability to perform is therefore crucial to successful project delivery. The key criteria for assessing subcontractors' eligibility for tender invitation and award, and subsequent performance at the construction stage, were investigated. Using the descriptive survey method, 243 contractors and 307 <b>subcontractors</b> registered with the Gauteng Master Builders Association of South Africa were surveyed. The multi-attribute technique was used to analyse the data. Results showed that quality record is the most influential criterion for selecting high performing <b>subcontractors</b> at the pre-qualification stage, and for assessing their performance at the construction stage. Tender price exerts the most significant influence in the subcontract award. A framework was developed for use by main contractors and consultants in the assessment of the suitability and performance of <b>subcontractors.</b> Application of the framework to a case study demonstrated its merit as a tool for ensuring that only high performing <b>subcontractors</b> are selected for subcontract jobs.

30|$|The {{dimension}} of the countervailing mechanism obeying a distinct logic {{is different from the}} debts shown in Fig.  4. Specifically, the countervailing mechanism was not intended to repay material suppliers and the upstream households in advance but to build a new mutual debt mechanism between the <b>subcontractors</b> and the households or the <b>subcontractors</b> and the material suppliers on the premise of keeping the original capital settlement period based on social time. It is distinguished from debt relations with <b>subcontractors</b> in which the material suppliers and the households had to pay some costs for their debts. The costs were caused by the market-dominant position of the <b>subcontractors</b> within the production and management frame. For example, in Pu Town there were some <b>subcontractors</b> lending money to households to purchase looms when these households faced capital shortages due to the expansion of scale or economic hardship and deducting the debts from the processing charges. The reverse debt relations were based on the cooperative relations between the <b>subcontractors</b> and the households. Additionally, capital settlement between them was also based on social time.|$|R

Under the new RCT system, a principal contractor must provide Revenue with details of the contract and the <b>subcontractor.</b> It must also notify Revenue of all relevant payments online before payment is made. Revenue will respond to the payment notification with a deduction authorisation setting out how much tax, if any, must be withheld. The rates are currently set at 0%, 20% or 35%. This deduction authorisation is sent electronically to the principal contractor. The principal must provide a copy or details of the deduction authorisation to the <b>subcontractor</b> if tax has been deducted. The <b>subcontractor</b> can set off the amount deducted against any tax he is liable to pay, or reclaim the difference where the deduction exceeds the amount of tax.|$|E

50|$|The cost of {{enforcing}} Adjudicators’ findings {{has proven to}} be also a disincentive for potential claimants.

40|$|Set-off {{relates to}} the {{situation}} where a main contractor raises a counterclaim against a <b>subcontractor's</b> claim or where an employer raises a counterclaim against the main contractor. The alternative terms cross claim, counterclaim, contra charge, compensation and retention are explained {{in the context of}} Scots law. Set-off in the construction industry in Scotland is then discussed within the contractual frameworks upon which main contractors are entitled to exercise such rights and how these conditions of contract have been formed over recent years. A study reported shows the extent of the use of amended and unamended forms of subcontract and main contractors' own forms of subcontract which imposed more onerous set-off conditions than the standard forms, the reasons given by main contractors for exercising their rights of set-off, the level of satisfaction amongst <b>subcontractors</b> with the sums set-off against them, the means by which main contractors and <b>subcontractors</b> settled disputed set-offs, and subcontractors' reasons for accepting unsatisfactory instances of set-off. The research was undertaken using a questionnaire to a stratified sample of <b>subcontractors</b> throughout central Scotland in 1995. Forty-seven <b>subcontractors</b> responded to the questionnaire and 427 instances of set-off were recorded. The study indicated that, despite the considerable protection given to <b>subcontractors</b> in the standard forms of subcontract and in common law, they were prepared to settle set-offs with which they were dissatisfied without initiating contractual proceedings which would have improved their situation. It would appear from this study that <b>subcontractors</b> are reluctant to use their contractual entitlements either because of fears over the costs of disputing set-offs or because they fear that they will be denied opportunities to tender for work in the future.

40|$|Main {{contractors}} use {{bid shopping}} to reduce a <b>subcontractor's</b> quoted price. The {{literature suggests that}} this is a practice disliked by many <b>subcontractors</b> and that the <b>subcontractor's</b> loss of revenue and margin is an important consequence. The vast majority of <b>subcontractors</b> in New Zealand are small in size, thus bid shopping can lead to <b>subcontractors</b> having greater exposure to additional financial risk, arising from the reduced margins they must accept. Whilst bid shopping has been mentioned as part of research on issues such as ethics and tendering practice, few empirical studies have directly focussed on bid shopping, and specifically, sought the perceptions of <b>subcontractors</b> themselves on the effects of bid shopping on their business. A questionnaire-based semi-structured interview survey of <b>subcontractors</b> was conducted, seeking their opinions on the prevalence, and seriousness of, bid shopping, what the effects of it are, and what measures they took to prevent their quotes from being bid shopped. The results established that bid shopping takes place regularly and is a matter of much concern to <b>subcontractors,</b> having a negative influence on their pricing decisions {{and the quality of the}} work they do. It also places more stress on the subcontractor‟s staff and limits the growth of their business. Significant implications for the construction industry are associated with safety on site, the quality of the subcontracted work, and the image of the main contractor in the market place.
