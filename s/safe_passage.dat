5|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Ireland they were stranded far outside {{the protection of}} the Norse–Gaelic longphorts. The ship was attacked by local Irishmen, despite the efforts of Olaf, who spoke the Gaelic, to negotiate <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> with them.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold {{hastened to}} the shore and ordered bargemen to row him downriver to where HMS Vulture was anchored, which then took him to New York. From the ship, Arnold {{wrote a letter to}} Washington, {{requesting}} that Peggy be given <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> to her family in Philadelphia, a request that Washington granted.|$|E
40|$|Learning {{from what}} young people say [...] . about sex, {{relationships}} and health <b>Safe</b> <b>Passages</b> to Adulthood In 1999, the UK Government’s Department for International Development (DfID) funded a five-year programme of research into young people’s sexual and reproductive health in poorer country settings. The <b>Safe</b> <b>Passages</b> to Adulthood programme aims to conduct and support research to enable {{young people to}} improve their sexual and reproductive health. In order {{to achieve this goal}} the programme is working to increase the research capacity of developing country partners and generate new knowledge that will lead to the development of clear, systematic guidelines for action at programme and policy levels. The five main objectives of the <b>Safe</b> <b>Passages</b> to Adulthood programme are: • To fill key knowledge gaps relating to the nature, magnitude and consequences of reproductive and sexual health problems among young people; • To identify situation-specific key determinants of young people’s sexual behaviour...|$|R
25|$|Two fully {{automated}} lighthouses {{operate on the}} island to aid passing maritime traffic: Bathurst Lighthouse and Wadjemup Lighthouse. An extensive network of flashing markers and transit beacons indicate <b>safe</b> <b>passages</b> through the rocky entrances to bays.|$|R

5|$|Ranavalona's reign {{was marked}} by a {{struggle}} between France and Britain to secure control over Madagascar. The French, who held several small islands off Madagascar, were interested in gaining control over the main island but this move was opposed by the British who {{had an interest in}} maintaining a <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> to India. Ranavalona pursued a policy of self-reliance to limit the influence of these foreign powers.|$|E
5|$|The Iranian Embassy siege {{took place}} from 30 April to 5 May 1980, after {{a group of}} six armed men stormed the Iranian embassy in South Kensington, London. The gunmen, members of an Iranian Arab group campaigning for Arab {{national}} sovereignty in the southern Iranian region of Khuzestan Province, took 26 people hostage—mostly embassy staff, but also several visitors {{as well as a}} police officer who had been guarding the embassy. They demanded the release of Arab prisoners from prisons in Khuzestan and their own <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> out of the United Kingdom. Margaret Thatcher's government quickly resolved that <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> would not be granted, and a siege ensued. Over the following days, police negotiators secured the release of five hostages in exchange for minor concessions, such as the broadcasting of the hostage-takers' demands on British television.|$|E
5|$|The White House sent a {{cable to}} the US Embassy, Saigon on November 4 agreeing that Cẩn {{and his mother}} needed evacuation. General Đổ Cao Trí, the {{commander}} of the ARVN I Corps, who had repressed the Buddhists in Huế, privately told Cẩn that the junta would allow him <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> out of Vietnam. On 5 November, Cẩn sought refuge at the US consulate with a suitcase crammed with US currency. Trí was then told that Cẩn was not safe in Huế and that he was to send Cẩn to Saigon, immediately for his own protection. Trí would only promise <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> in an American plane to Saigon, where embassy officials would meet Cẩn. On the journey to the capital, Cẩn was accompanied by four Americans: a vice-consul, two military policemen and a lieutenant colonel. He had intended to seek asylum in Japan.|$|E
50|$|Unknown to {{the people}} fleeing east in the tunnel, there were <b>safe</b> <b>passages</b> at {{intervals}} between the tubes; these might have enabled some victims {{to escape from the}} fire and smoke, but none of the unlocked doors available were used.|$|R
50|$|Rural Outreach {{services}} {{are available in}} rural areas that include safety planning, peer counseling, community education, emergency shelter transportation and legal advocacy. Transportation is provided to shelter and safe houses for victims fleeing aabuse. The agency is works with law enforcement to ensure <b>safe</b> <b>passages</b> for shelter victims.|$|R
50|$|In {{an attempt}} to avoid his mutinous crew, who had {{gathered}} in New York, Kidd sailed 120 miles around the eastern tip of Long Island, and then doubled back 90 miles along the Sound to Oyster Bay. He felt this was a <b>safer</b> <b>passage</b> than the high-trafficked narrows between Staten Island and Brooklyn.|$|R
5|$|The initial {{plan was}} to {{evacuate}} via Mogadishu International Airport. Soon after the evacuation request, the United States Air Force deployed C-130 transport planes and an AC-130, for gunfire support, to Nairobi, Kenya, awaiting clearances to enter Somalia {{and the ability to}} safely transfer evacuees from the embassy to the airport. However, the US and other foreign embassies were unable to contact anyone within the government to obtain clearances. It also became apparent that the rebels had an ineffective command-and-control structure, making it impossible to negotiate any ceasefire or guarantee of <b>safe</b> <b>passage.</b> Likewise, government troops faced a command-and-control problem; reports indicated that army units were separating along clan lines, in some cases soldiers shot officers of a different clan when given orders they disagreed with. Thus, it became clear that <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> to the airport would not be possible. Several other nations also had aircraft mobilized to reach Mogadishu, but faced the same problems of landing and transit of evacuees to the airport.|$|E
5|$|The rebels {{took control}} of the bridges {{connecting}} the city to the US, cut off electricity and telegraph, captured the bullring and reached {{the outskirts of the city}} center (where the second line of defenses had been constructed) on the first day of fighting. Navarro, influenced by the advice of the impetuous Col. Tamborrel, turned down an offer of <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> made by the rebels.|$|E
5|$|While campaigning against Venetian forces, Skanderbeg {{managed to}} inflict a serious defeat on July 23, 1448, seriously {{weakening}} Venetian power in Albania. The siege of Svetigrad continued, however, and Marin Barleti {{writes that the}} Ottomans bribed a soldier to throw a dead dog into {{the well of the}} fortress, forcing the garrison to refuse to drink out of it. It is more likely, however, that the Ottomans had cut off the water supply and induced the garrison to surrender. Given the circumstance, Perlati promised a surrender if the garrison were allowed a <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> through the Ottoman lines. Prince Mehmed suggested that the garrison should be promised <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> and then massacred, but Murad rejected his son's proposal, in fear that the rebellion would only be intensified through such an act; he decided to instead return the garrisoning force to Skanderbeg. On July 31, 1448 the garrison of Svetigrad surrendered.|$|E
50|$|Given the danger, Berry {{arranged}} {{to drag the}} Blanche across a sand bar that separated the Shoalhaven River from the Crookhaven River, with the Crookhaven entrance offering a <b>safer</b> <b>passage.</b> Hume then oversaw the digging of a canal through the bar using only hand tools, and constructing the first land navigable canal in Australia.|$|R
5000|$|Beltinge [...] {{is a low}} cliff-top {{suburb of}} Herne Bay in Kent, England. It forms the easternmost part of the urban area of Herne Bay and is {{just west of the}} small {{settlement}} of Reculver, which had an important Roman Fort and a channel which served to provide <b>safer</b> <b>passage</b> around what was the 'Isle of Thanet' until the early Middle Ages.|$|R
50|$|Heron Island was {{discovered}} on 12 January 1843 by the corvette HMS Fly. The ship was surveying {{the eastern edge}} of the Great Barrier Reef together with the cutter Bramble. The expedition was commanded by Captain Francis Blackwood and the reason for the expedition was mainly to map out detailed plans for <b>safe</b> <b>passages</b> within the reef. The island was named by Lieutenant Charles Bampfield Yule RN of the Bramble.|$|R
5|$|By {{the next}} morning, the loyalist forces had collapsed. Diệm {{and his younger}} brother and chief adviser, Ngô Đình Nhu, agreed to surrender, and coup plotter Đôn promised them <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> out of the country. In the meantime, Minh left Joint General Staff (JGS) {{headquarters}} and travelled to Gia Long Palace in a sedan, accompanied by Nhung. He arrived at the palace at 08:00 in full military uniform to supervise the arrest of Diệm and Nhu for the surrender ceremony.|$|E
5|$|During ancient times, Gibraltar was {{regarded}} by {{the peoples of}} the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The Phoenicians were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a shrine to the genius loci of the place, as did the Carthaginians and Romans after them. Excavations in the cave have shown that pottery, jewellery and Egyptian scarabs were left as offerings to the gods, probably in the hope of securing <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> through the dangerous waters of the Strait of Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|During the negotiations, the {{relatives}} {{of several of the}} West Side Boys were brought to the gang's camp to ask them to release the British soldiers. The gang responded that they had nothing against the soldiers, but that holding them had brought attention to their demands—which now included immunity from prosecution, <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> to the UK to take up university courses, and guaranteed acceptance to the re-formed Sierra Leone Army.|$|E
50|$|The {{character}} of 'The Cataclysm' is never mentioned, {{though in the}} opening titles the surface is depicted as a post-apocalyptic scene, implying nuclear warfare. Earth's inhabitants, ecosystems, and species have been exterminated, save those sheltered in an 'Oasis'. The skies immediately above the surface are ravaged by continuous lightning storms, dangerous air currents, and acidic clouds, known as the 'Warp Winds', through which the only <b>safe</b> <b>passages</b> are the hollow mountains known as 'Wind Pits'.|$|R
50|$|The Los Angeles School Police Department was {{established}} in August 1948 to provide police services to the Los Angeles Unified School District. The department deploys 6 police divisions (Valley-West, Valley-East, West, Central, East, and South) with assignments consisted of Canine (K-9), Youth Services Divions (Police Explorers, PALs Program), <b>Safe</b> <b>Passages</b> Motor Unit, Honor Guard, C.R.T. (Critical Response Team), Communications, Recruitment, Training Unit, Fleet Management, Payroll Section, Budget Services Unit, Records Unit, and Crime Analysis Unit.|$|R
50|$|The {{positions}} {{listed for}} ports are central positions that most represent each port. The distances are between positions shown for each port and are generally over routes that afford the <b>safest</b> <b>passage.</b> Most of the distances represent the shortest navigable routes, {{but in some}} cases, longer routes, that take advantage of favorable currents, have been used. In other cases, increased distances result from routes selected to avoid ice or other dangers to navigation, or to follow required separation schemes.|$|R
5|$|On 3 December 1992, the {{division}} headquarters was {{designated as the}} headquarters for all Army Forces (ARFOR) of the Unified Task Force (UNITAF) for Operation Restore Hope. Major General Steven L. Arnold, {{the division}} Commander, was named Army Forces commander. The 10th Mountain Division's mission was to secure major cities and roads to provide <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> of relief supplies to the Somali population suffering {{from the effects of}} the Somali Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to guide a group of anthropomorphised lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. To save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behaviour of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles to create a <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> {{for the rest of the}} lemmings.|$|E
5|$|The {{terms of}} the peace {{agreement}} were {{that no one would}} be enslaved, no harm would be done to the temples, nothing would be taken as booty and that <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> was given to Thomas, Harbees, and every citizen of Damascus who was not willing to live under Muslim rule. The peace agreement also stated that the peace would end after three days and that the Muslims could attack after these three days without violating the agreement.|$|E
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2013, High Mountain Park Preserve's Red Trail was {{extended}} along the sidewalk of Reservoir Drive to connect to the Preserve Shoreline Loop (White Trail). This newly blazed section crosses High Mountain Road (Bergen County Route 89) at its intersection with Reservoir Drive, entering the nature preserve through a recently created opening in the perimeter fence. A painted crosswalk and accompanying signage to alert motorists to pedestrians were installed at the intersection to facilitate <b>safer</b> <b>passage</b> over the busy county road.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} documented {{settlements in}} Bulwell appeared circa 800 A.D, and {{were most likely}} built {{around the same time}} as the first local bridge spanning across the River Leen. With the river being significantly narrower, shallower and slower-moving in Bulwell than in other potential locations along its length and the threat of highwaymen a very real danger on existing cross-country routes, a toll bridge was constructed in this outpost, allowing for a quicker and <b>safer</b> <b>passage</b> from north to south for travellers but providing an obstacle to less legitimate travellers.|$|R
50|$|The Real McCoy was a {{ferryboat}} that operated for 63 {{years from}} Rio Vista, California on the Ryer Island Ferry route {{as part of}} California State Route 84, and was {{the oldest and most}} reliable piece of equipment owned by the California Department of Transportation. During its operating life - making the trip 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and roughly 200 trips a day - totaling approximately 460,000 <b>safe</b> <b>passages</b> over the 800 foot gap in the Sacramento River delta, between Ryer Island and Rio Vista.|$|R
5|$|Though only {{numbering}} about 3,000 {{soldiers and}} 2,000 porters, the Belgo-Congolese force had to manage 15,000 prisoners {{in the former}} Galla-Sidamo Governorate after the campaign. At Gazzera's request, Gilliaert guaranteed the Eritrean askari <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> to British prisoner of war camps {{in the east and}} sent Congolese guards to protect them from Ethiopian retaliation. The Belgian force quickly returned to Congo with their spoils of war. The siege was the first major victory for the Free Belgian Forces and greatly improved their morale.|$|E
5|$|Varys summons Vala, a woman {{allied with}} the Sons of the Harpy, to the throne room in the Great Pyramid. He accuses her of conspiring to kill the Unsullied and Second Sons, but she replies by calling them foreign invaders. Varys tries to explain his {{perspective}} and mentions her son, Dom. Vala explains that if she gives him information on the Sons of the Harpy they will likely kill her. Varys offers her <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> to Pentos {{with a bag of}} silver for information.|$|E
5|$|Abdul Aziz's younger brother, Ghazi Abdul Rashid, {{had been}} {{negotiating}} {{with a government}} mediator. He claimed that the remaining students were willing to leave the mosque and lay down their arms, provided the government would grant them amnesty and not fire on them. Government officials were sceptical that Abdul Rashid would honour this agreement. In {{a telephone interview from}} a live transmission of Geo TV, Ghazi Abdul Rashid denied all the charges against him and reiterated his innocence. He further negotiated with the government for his <b>safe</b> <b>passage</b> and a guarantee that no harm would come to his followers inside the mosque. He also received a promise that his ailing mother would receive medical care.|$|E

60|$|King Ferdinand {{adopted the}} magnanimous measure {{recommended}} by the queen, but he accompanied it with several shrewd conditions, exacting tribute, military services, and <b>safe</b> <b>passages</b> and maintenance for Christian troops throughout the places which should adhere to Boabdil. The captive king readily submitted to these stipulations, and swore, after the manner of his faith, to observe them with exactitude. A truce was arranged for two years, during which the Castilian sovereigns engaged to maintain him on his throne and to assist him in recovering all places which he had lost during his captivity.|$|R
50|$|The canal was {{conceived}} {{as a way of}} providing much-needed employment to the Highland region. The area was depressed {{as a result of the}} Highland Clearances, which had deprived many of their homes and jobs. Laws had been introduced which sought to eradicate the local culture, including bans on wearing tartan, playing the bagpipes, and speaking Gaelic. Many emigrated to Canada or elsewhere, or moved to the Scottish Lowlands. The canal would also provide a <b>safer</b> <b>passage</b> for wooden sailing ships from the north east of Scotland to the south west, avoiding the route around the north coast via Cape Wrath and the Pentland Firth.|$|R
