5000|$|Prerequisites or prereqs are SYSMODS {{that are}} {{required}} to be installed before a second can be installed. Corequisites or coreqs are two or more SYSMODS that must be installed together, none can be installed without the others. A SYSMOD supresedes, or sups another if it functionally replaces the first. This prereq, coreq, and sup information is provided in the MCS. A requisite chain is the [...] "sequence of SYSMODs that are directly or indirectly identified as requisites for a given SYSMOD," [...] for example, if A is a prereq for B, and B is a prereq for C, then A and B are the requisite chain for C and both need to be installed before C, although not necessarily in a <b>separate</b> <b>run</b> of SMP/E.

Briefly, nineteen mass-labelled standards were added to each sample of about 4  g dried moss prior to accelerated solvent extraction with hexane:dichloromethane 1 : 1 (v:v). Samples were cleaned-up by a multicolumn procedure involving Na 2 SO 4 upon 2  g silica, BioBeads SX- 3, and Florisil (5 % deactivated). Instrumental detection of 19 HFR (TBA, ATE, BATE, DPTE, BTBPE, EHTeBB, BEHTBP, PBT, HBBz, PBEB, DBDPE, Dec 602, Dec 603, Dec 604, syn-DP, anti-DP, Cl 10 anti-DP, Cl 11 anti-DP, DPMA) occurred by gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry using atmospheric pressure ionization (GC-API-MS/MS).

40|$|VISART is a {{standardized}} format for postprocessor files with data calculated by fluid-dynamics and similar codes over a multi-dimensional geometry and time. VISART files primarily {{provide for the}} graphical {{evaluation of the results}} in a <b>separate</b> <b>run,</b> but they do not include graphics control information. The report states the geometrical and other assumptions for which the standard was developped and defines the standardized structure of the postprocessor files in the VISART format. The standard provides for regular and irregular, both full or defective, mesh geometries. The calculated quantities can be stored over all mesh cells, at selected cells or points or as space-independent quantities, and this at arbitrarily specified problem times. The VISART file contents, i. e. the total number, choice, kind etc. of the stored quantities, is not determined by the standard but by the code generating the file. Thus, by its flexibility and portability the VISART standard is suitable {{for a wide range of}} applications. (orig.)

40|$|I. Arguments {{in support}} of time {{variations}} of the high-speed solar neutrino flux, recorded with the Homestake detector. 1. In a <b>separate</b> <b>run</b> of measurements of solar neutrino by the Homestake detector, {{the ratio of the}} number of 37 Ar atoms per day (signal) to the average measuring error (noise) is ≈ 1. For the annual mean values, the signal–to-noise ratio is ≈ 3 − 4, which allows us to analyze cyclic (and, less reliably, “quasi-biennial”) variations of the solar neutrino flux, Pn (Rivin et al., 1983; Rivin, 1989 - 1993; Rivin & Obridko, 1997). 2. According to interpretation of the Pν curve and its spectrum, suggested in the mentioned works, these variations have two independent sources. One is the processes inside the convection zone that produce oscillations with a quasi-period T ≈ 1 years. Another source is associated with thermal processes in the core that have a characteristic period of ≈ 2 − 5 years, i. e. “quasi-biennial ” variations (Sacurai, 1979; Sacurai & Hasegawa, 1985; Rivin et al., 1983) ...|$|E
40|$|A sensitive, selective, and {{comprehensive}} method for the quantitative determination of tryptophan and 18 of its key metabolites in serum, urine, and cell culture supernatants was developed.

Fully (13) C isotope-labeled and deuterated internal standards were used to achieve accurate quantification. The applicability of the method to analyze serum, urine, and cell culture supernatants was demonstrated by recovery experiments and the evaluation of matrix effects. Precision for the analysis of serum, urine, and cell culture supernatants ranged between 1. 3 % and 16. 0 %, 1. 5 % and 13. 5 %, and 1. 0 % and 17. 4 %, respectively.

40|$|Does {{sentence}} comprehension {{related to}} faces modulate {{activity in the}} fusiform face area (FFA) and does sentence comprehension related to places modulate activity in the parahippocampal place area (PPA) ? We investigated this question in an fMRI experiment. Participants listened to sentences describing faces. places, or objects. with the latter serving as a control condition. In a <b>separate</b> <b>run,</b> we localized the FFA and PPA in each participant using a perceptual task. We observed a significant interaction between the region of interest (FFA vs. PPA) and sentence type (face vs. place). Activity in the left FFA was modulated by face sentences and in the left PPA was modulated by place sentences. Surprisinaly, activation in each region of interest was reduced when listening to sentences requiring semantic analysis related to that region's domain specificity. No modulation {{was found in the}} corresponding right hemisphere ROIs. We conclude that processing sentences may involve inhibition of some visual processing areas in a content-specific manner. Furthermore, our data indicate that this semantic-based modulation is restricted to the left hemisphere. We discuss how these results may constrain neural models of embodied semantics...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Very-fast Ultracentrifugation using a {{benchtop}} ultracentrifuge {{was applied}} to the analysis of lipoproteins in 0. 5 ml of human plasma. VLDL, 1 DL and LDL were flotated at densities of 1. 006, 1. 019 and 1. 063 kg/l in runs lasting 30, 100 and 100 minutes. Chylomicrons, if present, were flotated in a <b>separate</b> <b>run.</b> HDL were isolated by precipitation of the apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins from total plasma using polyethylene glycol. Three series of separations were routinely performed: 1. VLDL run alone (632 samples), 2. VLDL run H- LDL run (122 samples), and 3. Chylomicron Separation H- VLDL run + IDL run (92 samples). The concentrations of cholesterol and triacylglycerol were obtained for plasma, chylomicrons, VLDL, IDL, LDL and HDL. Plasma values ranged from 1. 8 to 37. 1 mmol/ 1 cholesterol and 0. 26 to 50. 2 mmol/ 1 triacylglycerol. The plasma triacylglycerol concentra-tions were corrected for free glycerol by 3 % (for triacylglycerols < 2. 5 mmol/ 1) and by 2 % (for triacylglycerols ^ 2. 5 mmol/ 1). The recovery rate of lipids after Ultracentrifugation was determined by comparing the concentrations in lipoproteins and in plasma. It was near to 100 % and decreased for samples with extremely high lipid concentra-tions...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new linearly scaling {{three-dimensional}} fragment (LS 3 DF) method for large scale ab initio electronic structure calculations. LS 3 DF {{is based on}} a divide-and-conquer approach, which incorporates a novel patching scheme that effectively cancels out the artificial boundary effects due to the subdivision of the system. As a consequence, the LS 3 DF program yields essentially the same results as direct density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The fragments of the LS 3 DF algorithm can be calculated separately with different groups of processors. This leads to almost perfect parallelization on over one hundred thousand processors. After code optimization, we were able to achieve 60. 3 Tflop/s, which is 23. 4 % of the theoretical peak speed on 30, 720 Cray XT 4 processor cores. In a <b>separate</b> <b>run</b> on a BlueGene/P system, we achieved 107. 5 Tflop/s on 131, 072 cores, or 24. 2 % of peak. Our 13, 824 atom ZnTeO alloy calculation runs 400 times faster than a direct DFT calculation, even presuming that the direct DFT calculation can scale well up to 17, 280 processor cores. These results demonstrate the applicability of the LS 3 DF method to material simulations, the advantage of using linearly scaling algorithms over conventional O(N 3) methods, and the potential for petascale computation using the LS 3 DF method.
