5|$|In 1893 {{at the age}} of 19, Goddard {{left her}} family and went to Paris. She {{extracted}} a meager allowance from her mother, took voice lessons, and for a time sang in a cabaret, before finding out she was pregnant and delivering a baby girl on February 17, 1887. She placed the infant in a convent for care, then travelled to Rome to study art. Goddard was the only female student in her life class, as it was unusual for women to work from nude models. She encountered what would now be called sexual harassment. When a fellow student left a book open on her stool with pornographic passages underlined, <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up and hit him in the face with it, but he and his friends stalked her. She fled to Capri after he tried to force her to marry him.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, Stoltenberg {{went into}} more detail {{about how she}} {{started out as a}} drug addict, to TV {{journalist}} Tonje Steinsland–the second time her life as an addict {{was the subject of a}} television special. It started in 1991, when she was 27. She witnessed two drug addicts in a fight in a cafe in Oslo when something fell out of the pocket of one of them. <b>She</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up and saw that it was heroin. Together with her boyfriend she went home and decided to snort the drug. For the next three years she was an intravenous drug user. By the end of the 1990s, she was close to dying.

60|$|There are no {{poor people}} in this quaint Valley. When a person desires a new hat he waits till one is ripe, and then <b>picks</b> <b>it</b> and wears it without asking anybody's permission. If a lady wishes a new ring, she {{examines}} carefully those upon the ring-tree, and when she finds one that fits her finger <b>she</b> <b>picks</b> <b>it</b> and wears it upon her hand. In this way they procure all they desire.|$|R
2500|$|Taylor was not {{involved}} in sports until she was fifteen.

50|$|The Doctor {{looks at}} the sample for a long time, then asks for a {{different}} one.

The Doctor drops it on his palm, and it does the same to his hand. His skin recovers almost instantly when the sliver is removed, and he tells her that hers will recover {{in a day or}} two.

60|$|The {{supplementary}} {{reading in}} sociology {{led her to}} a book on village-improvement--tree-planting, town pageants, girls' clubs.

50|$|An {{intruder}} (Bumerli) {{climbs in}} through her bedroom window. He {{is a very}} ordinary person, nothing like the ideal hero Nadina has been worshipping. In fact he has escaped the battle taking place nearby by climbing the Popoffs' drainpipe. He is in Serbian uniform, but responds to Nadina's patriotic posturing by revealing that his is actually Swiss, and is serving in the Serbian army as a mercenary. When she threatens {{to call for help}} he briefly threatens her with his revolver - but soon puts <b>it</b> down. When <b>she</b> <b>picks</b> <b>it</b> up and threatens him he laughs at her - he uses his ammunition pouch to carry chocolates and has no cartridges to load his weapon.|$|R

Cleria says that she would rather marry Death. Evagora exits; Leucippe and Clito advise Cleria to love, but she says that she prefers her freedom. Seeing an arrow on the ground, <b>she</b> <b>picks</b> <b>it</b> up and accidentally pricks her finger. Pallante runs out to make sure she is all right, and she falls madly in love with him. They all marvel at how powerful Amore and his arrows are. Pallante tells Cleria that he must go rescue Darete, but he will soon return to her.|$|R
60|$|I {{saw what}} she meant, of course. Gussie had bunged his heart at her feet; <b>she</b> had <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up, and, almost {{immediately}} after doing so, had discovered {{that he had been}} stewed to the eyebrows all the time. The shock must have been severe. No girl likes to feel that a chap has got to be thoroughly plastered before he can ask her to marry him. It wounds the pride.|$|R
