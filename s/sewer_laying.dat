50|$|Local {{developments}} in the 20th century were at first characterized by great infrastructural measures such as the waterworks, electricity, <b>sewer</b> <b>laying</b> and roadbuilding. Also, the outlying settlement of Scheidbachsiedlung vanished “from {{the face of the}} earth”. The First World War’s toll of 20 fallen and the Second World War’s toll of almost 70 either fallen or missing brought great pain into many Dickenschied families’ lives. After the Nazis’ Machtergreifung, the local Reichstag elections on 5 March 1933, before Gleichschaltung, saw Dickenschied’s “silent majority” vote for anyone but the NSDAP, despite the flood of Nazi propaganda.|$|E
50|$|Before cutting, fabric for sewing {{should be}} prepared, often by prewashing and ironing, and {{ensuring}} that the fabric grain is straight. Next, the <b>sewer</b> <b>lays</b> out pattern pieces, often based on a diagram provided with the pattern, {{with the intent of}} using as little fabric as possible. Patterns will specify whether to cut on the grain or the bias. Special placement may be required for directional, striped, or plaid fabrics.|$|R

50|$|Fulton County has a 7% {{total sales}} tax, {{including}} 4% state, 1% SPLOST, 1% homestead exemption, and 1% MARTA. Sales taxes apply {{through the entire}} county and its cities, except for Atlanta's additional 1% Municipal Option Sales Tax to fund capital improvements to its combined wastewater <b>sewer</b> systems (<b>laying</b> new pipes to separate storm sewers from sanitary sewers), and to its drinking water system. Fulton County has lowered its general fund millage rate by 26% over an eight-year period.|$|R
50|$|Utility {{companies}} have statutory powers to, for example, erect electrical substations or <b>lay</b> <b>sewers</b> or water pipes on or through someone else's land. These powers are counterbalanced by corresponding rights for landowners to compel utility companies to remove cables, pipes or sewers in other circumstances (see for example section 185 of the Water Industry Act 1991).|$|R

A second photo is of laborers in a neighborhood widening the street and <b>laying</b> <b>sewer</b> pipe. A third photo is of laborers next to a building improving a downtown city park. The fourth photo is of laborers <b>laying</b> a storm <b>sewer,</b> and the final photo is of laborers with teams of horses excavating for tanks for a sewage disposal plant...|$|R
40|$|Photograph. "San Francisco, Dec. 15 [...] Tight squeeze [...] Seemingly towering {{high above}} {{the deck of the}} Golden Gate Bridge, this ungainly barge with towering legs {{proceeds}} on its way towards the open sea. The craft, a 4, 500 -ton offshore mobile platform, said to be the world's largest, had to lower its 270 -foot towers 57 feet to squeeze under the bridge. The towers, which will eventually serve as legs reaching to the ocean floor, were raised again after passing the bridge to avoid grounding on the shallows before reaching the ocean. Barge will be used first in <b>laying</b> <b>sewer</b> pipe off Los Angeles and later in offshore oil drilling. " [...] caption by foot of photograph...|$|R
5000|$|Using the {{original}} Tiber Creek {{for commercial purposes}} was part of Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant's 1791 [...] "Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat {{of the government of}} the United States [...] [...] [...]". The idea was that the creek could be widened and channeled into a canal to the Potomac. By 1815 the western portion of the creek became part of the Washington City Canal, running along what is now Constitution Avenue. By the 1840s, however, because Washington had no separate storm drain and sewer system, the Washington City Canal had become a notorious open sewer. When Alexander [...] "Boss" [...] Shepherd joined the Board of Public Works in 1871, he and the Board engaged in a massive, albeit uneven, series of infrastructure improvements, including grading and paving streets, planting trees, installing <b>sewers</b> and <b>laying</b> out parks. One of these projects was to enclose Tiber Creek/Washington City Canal. A German immigrant engineer named Adolf Cluss, also on the Board, is credited with constructing a tunnel from Capitol Hill to the Potomac [...] "wide enough for a bus to drive through to put Tiber Creek underground." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{city has}} a {{strictly}} rectangular town plan of c. 525 x 350 m (around 18), and is laid out parallel with the coast. The urban area is subdivided by a regular network of streets oriented parallel with the walls, thus forming city blocks or insulae (a minimum of 58) of different dimensions. Fairly central to the plan are the principal streets, the cardo and decumanus maximus, with the forum square set south west of their crossroads. The regular street system consist of cardines and decumani neatly parallel and perpendicular with the main axes. According to the evidence from the surveys and the excavations they are some 5 m wide and normally consist of a surface of battered river pebbles. Excavations have revealed {{that at least some}} of them had one or two parallel footpaths and brick <b>sewers,</b> which <b>lay</b> underneath the roadway. It is likely that the city wall incorporated three major gates, as suggested by Livy’s account. The northern and western gates, both more or less centrally placed on the respective sides of the city and well-connected with the extramural road are securely located. All three roads leaving the city gates were bordered by cemeteries, with funeral monuments facing the roadway.|$|R
500|$|The venue was {{estimated}} to cost NOK26,500. Financing included a NOK3,000 grant from NFF, NOK1,500 from the municipality and NOK1,800 from the club. The rest was secured through various charity events, 320 of 1,500 man-days being volunteer work and a NOK8,000 loan from NFF. Construction in 1934 consisted of removing [...] of earthwork and <b>laying</b> <b>sewer</b> pipes. The following year, [...] of rock was blasted and the pitch was sown on 3 and 4 September. Construction of the terraces and dressing rooms took place in 1936. Work was not concluded until {{the morning of the}} inauguration match on 28 June 1936, when the last fence was mounted. Briskeby was the first grass pitch in Hedmark and was inaugurated with a match against Lyn, who won 4–1. [...] The venue cost NOK32,036.28, leaving the club with a debt of NOK18,688.93. The venue was awarded the 1938 Norwegian Football Cup Final, which required additional upgrades, largely conducted through volunteer work.|$|R

50|$|With so many bodies still {{lying in}} the earth at Volta Park, it is not {{uncommon}} for additional remains or for funerary monuments to be uncovered. About 1920, the Eden family living at 3311 Q Street NW uncovered nine bodies buried in the dirt floor of their basement. The family reburied them in the local street (at the time, a dirt road). Workmen digging a ditch for new fresh water lines uncovered human remains at the playground in September 1942. The bones were placed into boxes and interred at Blue Plains, a pauper's burial ground maintained by the city. About 1944, workmen digging a trench to <b>lay</b> <b>sewer</b> pipes across the southern part of the park exposed a brick burial vault. A large number of bones were removed from the vault, and taken away. Local residents often found tombstones or pieces of funerary monuments in the park. Carl Ernst, whose home was located at 1522 33rd Street NW, found numerous headstones in the 1930s and 1940s, some dating as far back as 1790. The Washington Post reported in 1949 that he embedded them in a cement wall on his property. In the early 1950s, workmen at the park unearthed the skeleton of a girl with long red hair and still wearing her funeral dress.|$|R
