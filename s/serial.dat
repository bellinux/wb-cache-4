5|$|Chemical {{restoration}} {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} milling. Typically, chemical milling is used to slowly remove material to create a desired shape. In <b>serial</b> number restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until the <b>serial</b> number is brought back to the surface. This can be performed due to the depth that <b>serial</b> numbers are engraved into the weapon. However, chemical restoration is limited by that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of the <b>serial</b> number is superficial. Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where the <b>serial</b> number used to be. This removes any debris from the area left when the <b>serial</b> number was obliterated. The examiner then chooses a chemical, usually an acid, that will be used to slowly bring the number back to the surface. The type of chemical that is used depends on the material the weapon is made of. These acids can range from Fry's Reagent for a magnetic metal, which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, cupric chloride, and distilled water, to an acidic ferric chloride solution for a non-magnetic, non-aluminum material.|$|E

5|$|After Quatermass and the Pit Kneale {{felt that}} it was time to rest the character.

5|$|Although not {{strictly}} a missing <b>serial,</b> {{production of the}} 1979 Tom Baker story Shada was curtailed by a technician's strike partway through recording. To prevent the half-finished material from being junked, incoming Doctor Who producer John Nathan-Turner placed a preservation order on it with an intention to later finish the production.

5|$|In 1995, BBC Radio {{producer}} Paul Quinn approached Kneale {{with the}} idea of making a new radio series about Quatermass, and the resulting project was produced and aired as the five-part <b>serial</b> The Quatermass Memoirs on BBC Radio 3 in the spring of 1996. The <b>serial</b> had three strands: a monologue from Kneale recounting the historical environment in which he created and wrote the original 1950s serials; archive material from the original productions and contemporary news broadcasts; and a dramatised strand set shortly before the 1979 <b>serial,</b> with Quatermass being visited in retreat in Scotland by a reporter eager to write his life story. Of the actors who had previously played Quatermass, only Keir and Mills were still alive; Keir took the role, his final professional performance before his death the following year.
