A linear rock cutting machine was used to conduct the tests with a rolling disc cutter. The tests were performed at varying depths with fixed disc spacing. Cutting forces were measured in the different rocks and cutting depths with rock yield determined and specific energy calculated. Comparing the results between cutting in dry and <b>saturated</b> <b>rock</b> showed reductions in cutting forces of 52 % and 7 % respectively for sandstone and limestone.

40|$|Abstract. The {{frequency}} dependent complex {{electrical conductivity}} of brine <b>saturated</b> <b>rocks</b> is extremely sensitive {{to changes in}} the volume, connectivity, orientation, and surface topography of pores and cracks. We have made triaxial deformation experiments on sandstone specimens saturated with distilled water. Experiments were carried out for several values of confining pressure, and in both drained and undrained regimes. During the deformation the full complex (in-phase and out-of-phase) electrical parameter set was measured (i. e. conductivity, resistivity, permittivity etc.) for 50 frequencies from 20 Hz to 1 MHz. Only the data at 1 kHz will be discussed here. This data tracks how the rock undergoes crack closure, followed by dilatancy, crack linking, and finally failure, as axial strain is increased. The data indicates well how early the formation of new cracks begins, showing that the quasi-linear portion of the stress-strain curve for triaxial deformation of <b>saturated</b> <b>rocks</b> does not represent truly elastic behaviour, but represents the combined effects of crack closure perpendicular to the strain axis and the formation of tensile cracks parallel to the strain axis. The electrical data has also been used to derive an electrical-equivalent change in porosity, and to examine the way that the cementation exponent and the tortuosity of the pore and crack network change during deformation...|$|R
40|$|Marine seismic {{reflection}} {{data collected}} from offshore southwestern Taiwan show prominent seismic bottom simulating reflectors (BSRs) that indicate the existence of gas hydrate in the seafloor sediment with free gas zone underneath. For the purpose of understanding the methane hydrate system (generation, migration and accumulation) {{as well as to}} delineate the methane hydrate reservoir properties, we used Amplitude Versus Offset (AVO) analysis of the seismic reflection data. AVO analysis is successfully used to discriminate between the presence of gas and lithologic variations in Bright Spot analysis. The theory behind AVO analysis finds its roots in Zoeppritz equations. These equations relate reflection coefficients and propagation angles. Qualitatively, seismic wave mode conversion is responsible for the dependence of amplitude anomalies in seismic data with respect to wavefront incidence angle or offset.

30|$|In the past, seismic {{exploration}} technique was mainly used for gathering information about subsurface rock structures and fluids {{by analyzing the}} travel time, reflection amplitude, and phase variations. However, nowadays, many additional seismic attributes have been introduced by the seismic interpreters, which aid in the visualization of subsurface geological structures, facies, and lithologies. This research aims to identify the pore fluids in the reservoir using post-stacked seismic data without requiring well log data. Gassmann’s equation, a well-known equation for fluid substitution, {{has been used for}} fluid substitution in this research. To test the proposed technique, a three-layer geological anticline model has been used. The third layer of the model represents a reservoir which is saturated with water, except its top part which is fully saturated with petroleum. Fluid identification is achieved by using fluid density, velocity changes, and acoustic impedance (AI). P-wave velocity and AI are measured from post-stacked seismic data and its inversion, from which the <b>saturated</b> <b>rock</b> density and compressional modulus (M) are calculated. Using this information, <b>saturated</b> <b>rock</b> density and compressional modulus are inverted for fluid velocity and density, respectively, to identify the pore fluid.|$|E

40|$|This thesis forms {{part of a}} {{continuing}} programme of research to investigate the application of NMR to fluid <b>saturated</b> <b>rock.</b> The work falls into four sections; (i) The development of a novel broad line NMR imaging technique {{for the study of}} short T 2 fluid components in reservoir rock The technique is a repetitive pulse variant of an established gradient echo method which employs oscillating magnetic field gradients. The variant uses low flip angle r. f. pulses to reduce image rounding artefacts and provide naturally T 1 weighted data. (ii) The selective imaging of fluids within preserved reservoir rock and the first broad line NMR imaging study of immiscible fluid flow. The selective imaging of reservoir fluids within preserved rock core samples has been achieved using T 1 weighted MRI methods. To account for the natural heterogeneity of the rock and the observed mixed wettability, T 1 suppression has been enhanced by lowering the temperature of the rock cores, thus exploiting the difference in dominant relaxation mechanisms of the two core fluids. A model has been developed to explain this temperature dependence in terms of pore surface relaxation theory. Fluid flow processes within reservoir rock have been investigated using chemical substitution and T 1 weighted imaging. Due to the short transverse relaxation times expected at irreducible saturation, short T 2 imaging protocols have been adopted and represent the first such study. This has provided quantitative data from which the individual phase saturations can be directly obtained. (iii) The first broad line NMR imaging study of liquid and vapour phase diffusion processes in partially <b>saturated</b> <b>rock.</b> Excellent agreement is found between the NMR diffusion profiles of partially <b>saturated</b> <b>rock</b> and a model based on a combination of vapour and liquid phase transport. Estimates of the surface water diffusion coefficient and vapour percolation threshold have thus been obtained. (iv) A detailed study of proton relaxation times of water-saturated rock as a function of saturation. The saturation levels range from 0. 06 %, equivalent to monolayer water coverage, to 100 %. The results have been used to test fast diffusion relaxation theory in rock over the full saturation range for the first time. The relaxation measurements at monolayer coverage have led to the first unambiguous estimates of rock plug pore surface relaxivity. Evidence has been obtained for the effect of pore throats on the relaxation times and pore throat size estimates have been made...|$|E

40|$|Petrophysical {{interpretation}} of 1 H NMR relaxation responses from <b>saturated</b> <b>rocks</b> {{is complicated by}} paramagnetic species present in fluids. Oxygen dissolved in liquids is one common example. Dipolar interactions of oxygen’s unpaired electron spin with the magnetic moment of fluid nuclei provide a strong relaxation mechanism known as paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE). As a result even low concentrations of dioxygen in its common triplet ground state significantly shorten longitudinal and transverse relaxation times of host fluids. This effect may be employed similarly to any standard tracer technique to study pore connectivity in porous media by detecting a change of oxygen concentration due to diffusion resolved in time and space. Furthermore, since relaxation enhancement due {{to the presence of}} oxygen is likely more significant in non-wetting phase than in wetting one, this difference can be utilized to study wettability in immiscible multiphase systems. We use a relaxation time contrast between air-saturated and oxygen-free fluids to evaluate an oxygen concentration change within two fluid phases <b>saturating</b> <b>rock,</b> to estimate time required to establish equilibrium concentration, and to calculate a mutual diffusion coefficient of oxygen. A spatially- and time-resolved T 2 (z,t) experiment provides the time-dependent oxygen concentration change along the fully- and partially-saturated carbonate core plug exposed to air saturated oil at its inlet.
