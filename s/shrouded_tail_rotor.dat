25|$|The SH09 is a light-medium helicopter, {{powered by}} a single Honeywell HTS900 {{turboshaft}} engine. It uses a shrouded fenestron tail rotor and the main rotor features a five-bladed bearingless hub; the <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> has a wider diameter and a thinner chord {{in order to increase}} airflow, while design aspects such as a narrow tail boom, swept-back tips on the main rotor blades, and the <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> purposefully reduce the SH09's noise signature. The HTS900 is capable of providing 1,020-shaft-horsepower, which is reportedly enough to produce high performance levels for the SH09 under hot and high conditions.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, Bell {{tested a}} <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> on the 407, {{but did not}} proceed with it. For a time, Bell studied {{developing}} the Model 407T twin-engine variant, but instead chose to develop the essentially all-new twin-PW206D powered Bell 427.|$|E
50|$|The DART 280 is a four-seat light-single piston-engined {{helicopter}} concept {{launched by}} Austrian Diamond Aircraft at the April 2017 AERO Friedrichshafen intended {{to compete with}} the Robinson R44. The composite aircraft will have a 1,350kg (2,500lb) MTOW and a 280shp (208kW) four-stroke jet-fuel engine, energy absorbing retractable landing gear and a <b>shrouded</b> electric <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> First flight is scheduled for October 2018 and certification a year later.|$|R
2500|$|As a clean-sheet design, the SH09 adopted several modern features, {{including}} an airframe that is entirely composed of carbon composite materials, a <b>shrouded</b> fenestron <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> and a high-visibility cockpit. The use of carbon composites {{is a key}} feature of the aircraft, which has been credited with enabling the high volume cabin to be adopted without incurring too much weight; according to Mathias Senes, Marenco's chief commercial officer: [...] "There’s no other material today that brings the benefits of rigidity, strength, and light weight". According to Stucki, the rotorcraft is designed around the perspective of pilots and this has driven many design attributes, principally those involving the cabin, to improve ergonomics, comfort, and operator requirements overall. In terms of flying capabilities, it possesses excellent hot and high performance, lengthy flight endurance, a low noise signature, and has relatively smooth handling.|$|R
25|$|The EC155 B {{features}} a completely redesigned cabin providing 30% more passenger space than previous Dauphin helicopter models, plus a 130% increase in baggage hold volume. Other major improvements include a five-blade Spheriflex composite main rotor {{combined with the}} familiar <b>shrouded</b> Fenestron <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> to reduce vibration levels significantly. The EC155 B is powered by two 635kW (851 shp) Turbomeca Arriel 2C1 turboshaft engines mounted over the luggage hold, which feature a dual-channel Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system. The EC155 B1 features uprated 697kW (935 shp) Arriel 2C2s. The helicopter can be fitted with an anti-icing system to enable the aircraft to operate in very cold climates. The all-glass cockpit is equipped with an 'Avionique Nouvelle' integrated digital flight control system featuring Eurocopter's Vehicle and Engine Management Display (VEMD), which utilizes active matrix liquid crystal displays. The EC155 is also equipped with a four-axis digital autopilot, coupled to the engine FADECs for full-envelope protection, and is offered with a Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS).|$|R
25|$|In November 2015, it was {{announced}} that certification of the H160 and its entry into service with civil operators were both scheduled to take place in 2018; a military-orientated variant, designated H160M, is aimed to enter service in 2022. In March 2016, H160 program chief Bernard Fujarski stated that nearly all milestones set for 2015 had been achieved, save for the second prototype's first flight having being delayed to January 2016, and that the H160’s aerodynamic configuration had been validated. Testing had revealed a need to relocate some electronics systems to the rotorcraft's nose from the rear portion of the main fuselage for center of gravity reasons, while the fenestron <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> had reportedly exceeded performance expectations.|$|E

50|$|The KC 518 is a {{composite}} fuselage helicopter kit for amateur construction. The airframe uses a carbon fiber and kevlar composite fuselage with a <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> An auxiliary fuel system can be installed.|$|E
40|$|Variable <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{speed is}} {{investigated}} {{as a method}} for reducing <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power, and improving helicopter performance. A helicopter model able to predict the main <b>rotor</b> and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> powers is presented, and the flight test data of the UH- 60 A helicopter is used for validation. The predictions of the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> powers are generally in good agreement with flight tests, which justifies {{the use of the}} present method in analyzing main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotors.</b> Reducing the main rotor speed can result in lower main rotor power at certain flight conditions. However, it increases the main rotor torque and the corresponding required <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> thrust to trim, which then decreases the yaw control margin of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> In hover, the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{may not be able to}} provide enough thrust to counter the main rotor torque, if it is slowed to follow the main rotor speed. The main rotor speed corresponding to the minimum main rotor power increases, if the change of <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power in hover is considered. As a helicopter translated to cruise, the induced power decreases, and the profile power increases, with the profile power dominating the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> Reducing the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed in cruise reduces the profile power to give a 37 % reduction in total <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power and a 1. 4 % reduction to total helicopter power. In high speed flight, varying the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed is ineffective for power reduction. The power reduction obtained by the variable <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed is reduced for increased helicopter weight...|$|R
40|$|A {{model test}} was {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of aerodynamic interaction between main <b>rotor,</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> and vertical fin on helicopter performance and noise in hover out of ground effect. The experimental data were obtained from hover tests performed with a. 151 scale Model 222 main <b>rotor,</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and vertical fin. Of primary interest was the effect of location of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> with respect to the main rotor. Penalties on main rotor power due to interaction with the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> ranged up to 3 % depending upon <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> location and orientation. Penalties on <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power due to fin blockage alone ranged up to 10 % for pusher <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> and up to 50 % for tractor <b>tail</b> <b>rotors.</b> The main rotor wake had only a second order effect on these tail rotor/fin interactions. Design charts are presented showing the penalties on main rotor power as a function of the relative location of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor...</b>|$|R

50|$|AAS-72X+: An armed {{military}} {{version of}} the Eurocopter EC145T2 also proposed for the Armed Aerial Scout program. It was equipped with more powerful engines with an extra 200 horsepower each, a fenestron <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> and a fully digital glass cockpit.|$|E

5000|$|Updated {{version of}} EC145, {{initially}} designated as EC145 T2. Features a conventional tail rotor {{replaced by a}} fenestron <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> Other changes include the installation of more powerful ( [...] Arriel 2E engines, and various new avionics. H145 is a marketing name for the BK 117 D-2.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{drive system}} {{consists}} of a shaft powered from the main transmission and a gearbox mounted {{at the end of}} the tail boom. The drive shaft may consist of one long shaft or a series of shorter shafts connected at both ends with flexible couplings, that allow the drive shaft to flex with the tail boom. The gearbox {{at the end of the}} tailboom provides an angled drive for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and may also include gearing to adjust the output to the optimum rotational speed for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> measured in rotations per minute (RPM). On larger helicopters with a tail pylon, intermediate gearboxes are used to transition the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> drive shaft from along the tailboom to the top of the pylon. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> pylon may also serve as a vertical stabilizing airfoil, to alleviate the power requirement for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> in forward flight. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> pylon may also serve to provide limited antitorque within certain airspeed ranges, in the event that the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> or the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> flight controls fail. About 10% of the engine power goes to the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b>|$|R
50|$|Recent {{technology}} in emergency <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> recovery systems has been advanced by the US Army in an SBIR research award to EATTS. The emergency anti-torque thruster system (EATTS) {{would allow a}} helicopter that has encountered <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> failure, or loss of <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> effectiveness, to land safely. The system is designed to counteract the torque from the helicopter's main <b>rotor</b> system during <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> failure {{as a result of}} mechanical problems as well as loss of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> from RPG hits.|$|R
50|$|When the {{trailing}} vortices colliding with the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> are rotating {{in the same}} direction, this causes a loss of thrust from the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> When {{the trailing}} vortices rotate {{in the opposite direction}} of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> thrust is increased. Use of the foot pedals is required to adjust the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor's</b> angle of attack, to compensate for these instabilities.|$|R
50|$|During the 1980s, Bruno Guimbal, {{while working}} at Eurocopter upon the Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin and Eurocopter EC120 Colibri helicopters, decided to {{independently}} pursue {{the development of a}} two-seat piston engine helicopter. This rotorcraft would incorporate numerous safety-related and general technological advances commonly applied to larger turbine-powered rotorcraft, but typically absent from piston-engine helicopters. These technologies included Eurocopter's Fenestron anti-torque <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and Spheriflex main rotor, in addition to a composite fuselage.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage fairing is {{made from}} composites. Its 21 ft diameter main rotor employs an ATI 012 (VR-7 mod) airfoil at the blade root, becoming an ATI 008 (VR-7 mod) at the tip. The main and tail rotor blades are of honeycomb composite construction. The cyclic control is roof-mounted, hanging down into the cockpit, but is otherwise conventional. The 23 in diameter tail rotor features a <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and a tailplane with end-fins.|$|E
50|$|The Bell 400 TwinRanger {{featured}} a reprofiled fuselage, two Allison 250 turboshafts, the OH-58D Kiowa's four-bladed main rotor, {{and a new}} <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> Bell also planned the single-engine 400A, and the 440 twin with a larger fuselage {{made possible by a}} high degree of composites. The Bell 400 first flew on April 4, 1984. Bell suspended development of the 400/440 family in the late 1980s as it felt unable to achieve a profitable production rate of 120 units a year.|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{results from}} an ongoing effort {{to model the}} {{interaction}} aerodynamics and aeroacoustics of main- and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> of a helicopter in subsonic flow are presented. The configurations studied are a) a two-blade main- and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> in hover, and b) a four-blade main- and a two-blade <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> in climb flight. The numerical approach consists of computing the unsteady pressure on the main- and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blade surface with a 3 -D unsteady free wake panel method and using this as input to a Ffowcs Williams Hawkings equation based aeroacoustic code to evaluate the noise characteristics. Parameters varied for the hover configuration are the lateral spacing between the main- and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> axis {{and the sense of}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> rotation. Main rotor interaction effects a significant change in the noise directivity pattern and noise level of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> <b>Tail</b> <b>rotor</b> contribution to the total noise dominates during the climb flight...|$|R
40|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> of a {{helicopter}} with a single main rotor configuration can experience {{a significant reduction in}} thrust when the aircraft operates in crosswind flight. Brown’s vorticity transport model has been used to simulate a main <b>rotor</b> and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> system translating at a sideslip angle that causes the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> to interact with the main rotor tip vortices as they propagate downstream at the lateral extremities of the wake. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is shown to exhibit a distinct directionally dependent mode during which <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> that are configured so that the blades travel forward {{at the top of the}} disk develop less thrust than <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> with the reverse sense of rotation. The range of flight speeds over which this mode exists is shown to vary considerably with the vertical location of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> At low flight speeds, the directionally dependent mode occurs because the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is immersed within not only the downwash from the main rotor but also the rotational flow associated with clusters of largely disorganized vorticity within the main rotor wake. At higher flight speeds, however, the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is immersed within a coherent supervortex that strongly influences the velocity field surrounding the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor...</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{itself is}} a hazard to ground crews working near a running helicopter. For this reason, <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> are painted with stripes of {{alternating}} colors to increase their visibility to ground crews while the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is spinning.|$|R
5000|$|Airbus Helicopters and its {{predecessor}} companies {{have established a}} wide range of helicopter firsts, including the first production turboshaft-powered helicopter (the Aérospatiale Alouette II of 1955); the introduction of the Fenestron <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> (on the Gazelle of 1968); the first helicopter certified for full flight in icing conditions (the AS332 Super Puma, in 1984); the first production helicopter with a Fly-by-wire control system (the NHIndustries NH90, first flown in full FBW mode in 2003); the first helicopter to use a Fly-by-light primary control system (an EC135 testbed, first flown in 2003); and the first ever landing of a helicopter on Mt. Everest (achieved by an AS350 B3 in 2005).|$|E

50|$|In 2011, Eurocopter officially {{launched}} an upgraded EC145 model, designated EC145 T2, unveiling the new type at Heli Expo 2011. The EC145 T2 {{is designed to}} significantly increase the aircraft's performance, featuring new Arriel 2E turboshaft engines, dual-digital Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC), Eurocopter's Fenestron <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> design, and upgraded tail and main rotor gear boxes. Considerable differences and improvements {{were introduced to the}} cockpit and aircraft subsystems, including the adoption of increasingly digital avionics and a fully modular approach to these systems; amongst the biggest changes is a sophisticated 4-axis autopilot. In April 2014, airworthiness certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency for the EC145 T2 was received, FAA certification followed in October 2014.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This study aims to {{investigate}} the effects of mass and stiffness imbalance in a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> induced by damage in forward flight. Design/methodology/approach – An aeroelastic analysis based on finite element {{in space and time}} and capable of modeling dissimilar blades is carried out to study the effect of damage occurring in one, two, and three blades in a four-bladed <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> system in forward flight. The effect of damage growth on vibratory hub loads and blade responses is studied using a comprehensive aeroelastic code. Findings – The diagnostic chart which is the summary of damage analysis of <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> shows that the root hub vibration spectrum gives enough indication to predict damage growth in the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blade. Hence, this can be useful towards development of health monitoring system for <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blades. Originality/value – The proposed analysis helps in understanding the basic physics behind the damaged <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and also gives qualitative assessment of damaged <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> where obtaining the flight test data with damaged <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is difficult...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} made of {{helicopter}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> noise, particularly that due to interactions with the main rotor tip vortices, and with the fuselage separation mean wake. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blade-main rotor tip vortex interaction is modelled as an airfoil of infinite span cutting through a moving vortex. The vortex and the geometry information required by the analyses are obtained through a free wake geometry analysis of the main rotor. The acoustic pressure-time histories for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blade-vortex interactions are then calculated. These acoustic results are compared to <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> loading and thickness noise, and {{are found to be}} significant to the overall <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> noise generation. Under most helicopter operating conditions, large acoustic pressure fluctuations can be generated due to a series of skewed main rotor tip vortices passing through the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> disk. The noise generation depends strongly upon the helicopter operating conditions and the location of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> relative to the main rotor...|$|R
50|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{is powered}} by the helicopter's main power plant, and rotates at a speed {{proportional}} {{to that of the}} main rotor. In both piston and turbine powered helicopters, the main <b>rotor</b> and the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> are mechanically connected through a freewheeling clutch system, which allows the rotors to keep turning {{in the event of an}} engine failure by mechanically de-linking the engine from both the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotors.</b> During autorotation, the momentum of the main rotor continues to power the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and allow directional control. To optimize its function for forward flight, the blades of a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> have no twist to reduce the profile drag, because the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is mounted with its axis of rotation perpendicular to the direction of flight.|$|R
40|$|In the {{research}} programme 'Silent Helicopter Cabin', several different measures for {{the reduction of}} cabin noise were investigated, in detail: {{the improvement of the}} characteristics of the acoustic cabin treatment, the integration of resonators in cabin isolation and fuselage structure, the application of passive absorbers and isolators and the use of active main gear box struts in laboratory and flight test on BK 117. To the latter application, also control systems working in time domain were developed and adapted. After promising laboratory results and as extension of the original planning, the active struts were tested succfessfully also on a BK 117 in ground runs. The technology will be further developed in the Aeronautical Research Programme ADASYS II. The acoustic efficiency of resonators was also tested on the <b>shrouded</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> (Fenestron) of the EC 135. To that purpose, models were applied at DC Ottobrunn and in the wind tunnel of the Technical University RWTH Aachen. The results show beneficial effects at low forward speed, typical for helicopter approach. Each of the described research results represents an important contribution to the goal to attainlow cabin noise levels. For a combined application of all measures mentioned above, already today the accomplishment of the targeted noise level below 80 dB(A) can be assessed. For that however, the individual technologies still have to undergo a maturing process. (orig.)

40|$|Balancing is a {{rotating}} component {{is critical in}} any mechanism. Devoid of proper balancing, any vehicle-be it in air, land or sea, it will affect stability, control and safety. The same goes for rotor crafts. Imbalance of the helicopter <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> system leads to vibrations in the entire vehicle and may cause accident. Typically, for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> of a helicopter, the blade {{is a source of}} vibration on the tail boom. This not only causes inconvenience to the pilot but also reduces the life span of the helicopter. There {{is a certain amount of}} vibration in the helicopter rotor systems especially the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> Hence, balancing procedure for rotating mass was conducted to reduce the vibration. This research focuses on balancing of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> for UTM Single Seat Helicopter. Experiments have been conducted in order to study the vibration level of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> Adding and removing masses separately on the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> exhibited different vibration levels.

50|$|Based on {{the success}} of Harbin Z-9 and HC120, fenestron {{configuration}} was originally adopted for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> However, due to the inherent disadvantages of the design, such as higher power requirement, higher construction and maintenance cost, higher resistance and weight, fenestron design was dropped after test flights, and a more conventional <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> configuration was adopted. The 4-blade <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is similar to the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> of AH-64, with two pairs at unequal distance instead of 4 blades at the equal distance, and one of the main purposes of such arrangement was to reduce noise. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blades consist of a total of 11 layers of glass-reinforced plastic and composite material, enabling them to sustain direct bullet hits.|$|R
