40|$|The {{systematic}} {{development of}} water-soluble acrylic copolymers with significant <b>shrink-resist</b> effectiveness is described. Copolymers of 2 -sulphoethylmethacrylate are readily {{soluble in water}} above pH 2. The incorporation of self-crosslinking monomers into the copolymer gives considerably better <b>shrink-resist</b> results than the use of external crosslinkers. Co-polymers of glycidylmethacrylate, which are curable at or alove pH 7, are more effective than copolymers of N-methylol-acrylamide, which are usually cured {{in the presence of}} strong acidic catalyst. The effect of the latter polymers can be considerably improved if the wool is either pretreated or saturated with the acidic catalyst before polymer application. <b>Shrink-resist</b> finishes based on polymers have a num-ber of advantages over those using degradative chemical treatmeht, and their use is steadily increasing [5, 22...|$|E
40|$|A {{commercial}} protease, Esperase, was covalently {{linked to}} Eudragit S- 100, a reversible soluble–insoluble polymer by carbodiimide coupling. When {{compared to the}} native enzyme, the immobilized form presented a lower specific activity towards high molecular weight substrates but a higher thermal stability at all temperatures tested. The optimum pH of the immobilized protease was shifted towards the alkaline side by about one pH unit while there was no change in optimum temperature between the free and immobilized protease. The immobilized protease exhibited a good storage stability and re-usability. Enzymatic treatment of wool using proteases has been investigated for wool <b>shrink-resist</b> finishing. It was found that using the immobilized protease in the enzymatic treatment of wool there was a reduction of weight and fibre tensile strength loss because the proteolytic attack is only limited to the cuticle surfaces of wool fibres. This novel approach is a promising alternative for wool <b>shrink-resist</b> finishing to replace the conventional chlorine treatments. This environmentally friendly bioprocess needs to be further characterized to a complete understanding and optimization...|$|E
40|$|Knitted {{wool and}} wool/nylon blend dyed fabrics {{were treated with}} low {{temperature}} plasma (LTP) to achieve optimum shrink-resistance without impairing surface topography, colour or fastness to washing of the fabrics. As LTP tends to impair handle of the fabrics, both wool and wool/nylon blend fabrics were submitted to industrial softening and/or biopolymer treatments after LTP treatment, leading to hydrophilic wool and wool/nylon blend fabrics with improved shrink-resistance without any colour changes and good fastness to washing. The results obtained were compared with those obtained by an industrial <b>shrink-resist</b> treatment. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel chemical treatment for achieving sustained <b>shrink-resist</b> performance on natural keratin fibers. The new treatment involves the controlled reduction of keratin in the cuticle {{region of the}} fiber, {{and the application of}} a water soluble diacrylate, namely glycerol 1, 3 -diglycerolate diacrylate (GDA), on the reduced keratin substrate. The acrylate groups of the GDA react with cysteine residues in the reduced keratin through thiol-ene click reactions at room temperature, leading to GDA grafting and the formation of GDA crosslinks in the keratin structure. The modified substrates were characterized by infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, and assessed for its shrink-resistance and wet burst strength. This chemical modification has shown to alter the fiber surface morphology and hydrophilicity, resulting in substantially improved shrink-resistance with good fiber strength retention. Possible shrink-resistance mechanisms were also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The low {{abrasion}} resistance of wool fabrics compared with many man-made fibre fabrics {{is known to}} be a frequent cause of consumer dissatisfaction particularly in pure wool suiting fabrics. Accordingly this project was undertaken to attempt to improve the {{abrasion resistance}} {{in order to maintain the}} quality image associated with wool fabrics and improve their market competitiveness vis-ä-vis other fabrics. Although several workers have discussed the effects of particular finishes on specific fabrics, very little systematic investigation of the effects of chemical treatments on the abrasion resistance of wool fabrics has been carried out. In the current study the difference in abrasion rates of woven wool fabrics composed of different structures have been studied in relation to the abrasion resistance and other relevant physical properties. The work carried out in this thesis is divided into two parts. A review of the literature is followed by a description of the experimental work carried out. The review of the literature summarises current views on the general mechanisms and factors involved in abrasion processes for textile fabrics and the effects of selective finishing treatments on the abrasion resistance of wool fabrics. In addition details of the abrasion testing conditions used in this work for determining fabric abrasion resistance have been described. The' experimental work is concerned with the changes in wool fabric abrasion resistance produced by the following treatments: (i) Application of polymer <b>shrink-resist</b> finishes by padding and by exhaustion treatments, (ii) Treatment with organic solvents, (iii) Treatment with ethylene glycol at- 1500 C, (iv) Deamination and esterification, (v) High temperature steaming (130 °C), (vi) Dyeing, (vii), Wet abrasion. Because of the great commercial importance of polymer shrink resist finishes for wool fabrics, the main objects of the experimental work were to establish the effects of a range of polymer <b>shrink-resist</b> finishes applied by conventional padding and exhaustion techniques on the abrasion resistance of wool fabrics and the mechanisms by which the abrasion resistance is improved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Low-temperature plasma technology—both glow {{discharge}} under reduced pressure {{as well as}} barrier discharge under normal pressure—are well established in different indus-trial applications. Since recently, however, the plasma technology is being introduced in tex-tile industry as well. Fields of application are desizing, functionalizing, and design of surface properties of textile fibers. Plasma technology is suitable to modify the chemical structure {{as well as the}} topography of the surface of the material. Examples of natural as well as man-made fibers prove the enormous potential of plasma treatment of textile materials. It has proven to be successful in <b>shrink-resist</b> treatment of wool with a simultaneously positive effect on the dyeing and printing. Not only the chemical structure of the surface is modified using different plasma gases but also the topography of the surface. A highly hydrophobic surface with a particular sur-face topography in contact with water is extremely dust- and dirt-repellent and hence should be also repellent to bacteria and fungi. Man-made fibers to be used under chemical stress are modified with diffusion-barrier layers on their surfaces without modifying the bulk properties; hence, the stability of those fibers is significantly improved...|$|E
