5|$|Old <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} slow, well-pronounced {{and dignified}} like the Maguindanao’s kamamatuan and the Maranao’s andung. Genres classified under this style have moderate tempos, are rhythmically oriented, balanced, lack many improvisations {{and are usually}} played by the older folks and are therefore always played first, to give due respect to the older generation.|$|E

Some of these <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> more problematic than others, and, although they are not disorders in the clinical sense, are sometimes discussed under the term 'attachment disorder'.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus has {{developed}} in stages, from the Viking age to modern times, all {{visible in the}} city today. Many architectural <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> represented {{in different parts of}} the city such as Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, National Romantic, Nordic Classicism, Neoclassical, Empire and Functionalism. The city has grown up around the main transport hubs, the river, the harbour and later the railway station, and as a result, the oldest parts of the city are also the most central and busiest today.|$|E
5|$|Burch's {{style has}} been {{described}} as preppy-boho and preppy-bohemian luxe, and is associated with her T-logo medallion. Known for being easy to wear and versatile, her <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> popular with women of all ages, including the viewers and fans of the television show Gossip Girl, where they were often featured. In 2007, there were wait lists to buy Tory Burch fashions, which are known for color and print and often pay homage to styles of the 1960s and 1970s. Burch named her line of Reva ballerina flats after her mother.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{its long}} {{construction}} process, several <b>styles</b> <b>were</b> used {{in different parts}} of the cathedral, particularly the Romanesque and Gothic ones.

5|$|Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a {{genre of}} rock music that {{developed}} in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, George {{published}} a revised arrangement that placed B.attenuata in the subgenus Banksia {{because of its}} flower spike, section Banksia because its <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> straight rather than hooked, and the series Cyrtostylis, a large and rather heterogenous series of twelve species. He conceded its large emarginate cotyledons (having a notch in their apex) were quite different from other members, {{and that it had}} similarities in flower architecture to another anomalous member B.elegans. He felt B.attenuata to have affinities to B.lindleyana and B.media.|$|E
5|$|In {{early to}} mid 20th century, Deshastha men {{used to wear}} a black cap to cover their head, with a turban or a pagadi being popular before that. For {{religious}} ceremonies males wore a coloured silk dhoti called a sovale. In modern times, dhotis are only worn by older men in rural areas. In urban areas, just like women, a range of <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> preferred. For example, the Deshastha politician Manohar Joshi prefers white fine khadi kurtas, while younger men prefer modern western clothes such as jeans.|$|E
50|$|Kiyomotobushi (清元節?) - Kiyomoto Enjyudayu (清元延寿太夫?) {{began to}} play this for kabuki dances in Edo during the late Edo period. He {{began to play}} this style in 1814.

50|$|The galant <b>style</b> <b>was</b> an 18th-century {{movement}} in music, visual arts and literature. In Germany a closely related <b>style</b> <b>was</b> called the empfindsamer Stil. Another close relative <b>is</b> rococo <b>style.</b> The galant <b>style</b> <b>was</b> drawn {{in opposition to}} the strictures of the Baroque style, emphasizing light elegance in place of the Baroque's dignified seriousness and high grandeur.|$|R
50|$|The fourth <b>style</b> <b>is</b> {{characterized}} by horizontal courses of masonry, not always {{of the same}} height, but of stones which are all rectangular. This <b>style</b> <b>is</b> common in Attica.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, {{in their}} Philadelphia apartment, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Jim find their living <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> {{increasingly}} clashing. Jim is slovenly, leaving dirty dishes {{to soak in}} the sink until someone else washes them, while Darryl is so fastidious about his possessions that he puts labels with his name on all of them, even a bag of flour. When Darryl takes issue with Jim using his labeled coffee mug, the two begin bickering. Eventually the two come to understand each other's habits better, and relieve tension by playing a video game together.|$|E
5|$|The History of Hip-Hop dance {{encompasses}} {{the people and}} events since the late 1960s that {{have contributed to the}} development of the early hip-hop dance moves, such as uprock, breaking, locking, roboting, boogaloo, and popping. Black Americans and Latino Americans created uprock and breaking in New York City. Black Americans in California created locking, roboting, boogaloo, and popping—collectively referred to as the funk styles. All of these dance <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> different stylistically. They share common ground in their street origins and in their improvisational nature.|$|E
5|$|There {{are certain}} {{architectural}} styles {{present in the}} game; architectural styles determine the appearance of in-game buildings. Each civilization is automatically assigned its architectural style. These three architectural <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> the Western European, which consists of classical styled wooden buildings and is shared by the British, French and Dutch; the Eastern European, which consists of wooden and straw structures and is shared by the Germans and Russians, and the Mediterranean, which consists of buildings made of stucco cement and dry brick, which is shared by the Spanish, Portuguese and Ottomans.|$|E
50|$|This <b>style</b> <b>is</b> {{supposed}} to have its origin in old palace architecture Another example of this <b>style</b> <b>is</b> Sumiyoshi Jinja, part of the Sumiyoshi Sanjin complex in Fukuoka Prefecture.|$|R
50|$|The screen {{paintings}} that Motonobu made served as architectural decorations. They appealed {{greatly to the}} warrior class. Some of his landscapes {{were made in the}} styles of three different masters. The soft ink-wash <b>style</b> <b>was</b> made by Mu-ch'i Fa-ch'ang, the more rigid, hard, stiff <b>style</b> <b>was</b> produced by Hsia Kuei, and the broken ink <b>style</b> <b>was</b> made by Yü Chien (c. 1230).|$|R
50|$|Huth's guitar <b>style</b> <b>is</b> quite distinctive, {{combining}} {{creative use of}} dissonance {{with heavy}} use of distortion. His <b>style</b> <b>is</b> clearly blues-influenced, incorporating extensive use of bends, and the blues scale.|$|R
5|$|Two {{distinct}} architectural <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> {{visible in}} the Estate. Originally constructed in the Federal style for Henry Bates Grubb between 1800 and 1805, Mount Hope Estate was the most formal ironmaster's mansion built in the area between 1750 and 1850. In 1895, Daisy Grubb oversaw significant changes, adding a Victorian ballroom, a billiard room, chandeliers, and parquet floors, and converting original hinged doors to sliding doors, while still maintaining much of the original construction, including the original facade and fireplace mantels.|$|E
5|$|While {{breaking}} {{was developing}} in New York, other styles of dance were developing in California. Unlike breaking, the funk styles—which {{originated in the}} 1970s in California—were not originally hip-hop dance styles: they were danced to funk music rather than hip-hop music, {{and they were not}} associated with the other cultural pillars of hip-hop (DJing, graffiti writing, and MCing). The funk <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> actually slightly older than breaking due to fact that boogaloo and locking were developed in the late 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Italian folk <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> very diverse, {{and include}} monophonic, polyphonic, and responsorial song, choral, {{instrumental}} and vocal music, and other styles. Choral singing and polyphonic song forms are primarily found in northern Italy, while south of Naples, solo singing is more common, and groups usually use unison singing {{in two or}} three parts carried by a single performer. Northern ballad-singing is syllabic, with a strict tempo and intelligible lyrics, while southern styles use a rubato tempo, and a strained, tense vocal style. Folk musicians use the dialect of their own regional tradition; this rejection of the standard Italian language in folk song is nearly universal. There is little perception of a common Italian folk tradition, and the country's folk music never became a national symbol.|$|E
50|$|The oldest {{remains of}} the {{architectural}} landmarks in this <b>style</b> <b>are</b> the Teppe Zagheh, near Qazvin. Other extant examples of this <b>style</b> <b>are</b> Chogha zanbil, Sialk, Shahr-i Sokhta, and Ecbatana.|$|R

25|$|This <b>style</b> <b>is</b> {{used by the}} Rundata project, {{although}} it does not attribute it to Gräslund's model. The <b>style</b> <b>is</b> common in western Södermanland and it is characterized by bordered crosses.|$|R
5|$|Outside {{downtown}} Washington, architectural <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> {{even more}} varied. Historic buildings are designed {{primarily in the}} Queen Anne, Châteauesque, Richardsonian Romanesque, Georgian revival, Beaux-Arts, {{and a variety of}} Victorian styles. Rowhouses are especially prominent in areas developed after the Civil War and typically follow Federalist and late Victorian designs. Georgetown's Old Stone House was built in 1765, making it the oldest-standing original building in the city. Founded in 1789, Georgetown University features a mix of Romanesque and Gothic Revival architecture. The Ronald Reagan Building is the largest building in the District with a total area of approximately 3.1million squarefeet (288,000m2).|$|E
5|$|Revelations: Persona is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} in which the player takes control {{of a group of}} high school students. A mixture of navigation <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> used: navigation round the students' hometown is done using an overhead view, navigation of standard environments such as outside areas and story locations use an angled third-person view, and dungeons and most buildings are navigating in first-person. An icon in the top right-hand corner of the screen displays a lunar phase: this display shows the passage of in-game time, and its status determines the activity patterns and moods of enemy demons. Battles are both triggered by story events and through random encounters around the world map and dungeon environments. If the player attacks an enemy from behind, the party is given a set of attacks costing no magic points or health points.|$|E
5|$|The Blackstone Hotel was {{designed}} by architect Benjamin Marshall, of Marshall and Fox, in 1909. Sources vary as to the precise style in which Marshall designed the building. According to the Landmarks Division of the City of Chicago's Department of Planning and Development, the hotel's exterior and interior are considered {{an excellent example of}} neoclassical Beaux-Arts architecture; the nomination form for the building's listing on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places classifies the structure as distinctly Second Empire. However, the two <b>styles</b> <b>are</b> related, and the Blackstone Hotel demonstrates elements from both schools. The design was influenced by Marshall's trip to Paris, after which he completed the hotel.|$|E
50|$|The Urnes <b>Style</b> <b>was</b> {{the last}} phase of Scandinavian animal art {{during the second}} half of the 11th century and in the early 12th century. The Urnes <b>Style</b> <b>is</b> named after the {{northern}} gate of the Urnes stave church in Norway, but most objects in the <b>style</b> <b>are</b> runestones in Uppland, Sweden, which is why some scholars prefer to call it the Runestone style.|$|R
30|$|One <b>style</b> <b>is</b> that {{in recent}} drama. I like the Korean actress, Yoon Eunhye’s style. Another kind of Korean <b>style</b> <b>is</b> lace, chiffon, blouse, and then the {{following}} is a small skirt (Chen).|$|R
50|$|This control <b>style</b> <b>is</b> a {{variation}} of the centralized control <b>style</b> wherein control <b>is</b> factored among a group of objects whose actions are coordinated. The main difference between a clustered and delegated control <b>style</b> <b>is</b> that in a clustered control style, the decision making objects are located within a control center whereas in a delegated control <b>style</b> they <b>are</b> mostly outside.|$|R
