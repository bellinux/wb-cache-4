40|$|In this report, an object-space {{solution}} to occluder fusion of OBB occluders is explored. Two different approaches are considered were the object-space fusion {{is reduced to}} a 2 D problem. The first approach finds axis-aligned <b>silhouettes</b> within the projection of occluder OBBs which are then fused together creating large axis-aligned <b>silhouettes.</b> The other approach creates concave hulls of the projected OBB <b>silhouettes</b> from which convex inscribed <b>silhouettes</b> are then found. These <b>silhouettes</b> are then converted back to object-space where shadow frusta created around the <b>silhouettes</b> are used for the culling operation. The effectiveness of the two approaches is evaluated considering the amount of culled geometry. It is shown that fused convex <b>silhouettes</b> are needed to produce competitive results...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this research work is to develop an efficient and intuitive deformation technique for virtual human modeling by <b>silhouettes</b> input. With our method, the reference <b>silhouettes</b> (the front-view and right-view <b>silhouettes</b> of the synthetic human model) and the target <b>silhouettes</b> (the front-view and right-view <b>silhouettes</b> of the human from the photographs) are used to modify the synthetic human model, which is represented by a polygonal mesh. The system moves the vertices of the polygonal model so that the spatial relation between the original positions and the reference <b>silhouettes</b> {{is identical to the}} relation between the resulting positions and the target <b>silhouettes.</b> Our method is related to the axial deformation. The self-intersection problem is solved...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new method for <b>silhouettes</b> matching. <b>Silhouettes</b> of 3 D objects, {{extracted}} from 2 D images, are described according to LWDOS language [1]. Sometimes, even <b>silhouettes</b> appear identical; their LWDOS descriptors may be very different therefore we wrongly conclude that the two <b>silhouettes</b> are different. In order to resolve such problem due to several phenomenons, we try to deduce the same descriptor from the two slightly different descriptors of the two <b>silhouettes...</b>|$|R

5|$|When {{early in}} the film {{newspaper}} clippings {{from around the globe}} are shown, in the Japanese newspaper the iconic <b>silhouette</b> of Godzilla is clearly visible.

5|$|An {{equivalent}} active camouflage strategy, {{known to}} zoologists as counter-illumination, {{is used by}} many marine organisms, notably cephalopods such as the midwater squid, Abralia veranyi. The underside is covered with small photophores, organs that produce light. The squid varies {{the intensity of the}} light according to the brightness of the sea surface far above, providing effective camouflage by painting out the animal's <b>silhouette</b> with light.|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{age differences}} {{in the ability to}} resolve competition for figural status in stationary displays using small, enclosed, symmetrical <b>silhouettes</b> that participants classified as depicting "novel'' or "familiar'' shapes. The <b>silhouettes</b> were biased such that the inside was perceived as the shaped figure, and the outside was perceived as a shapeless ground. The critical manipulation was whether a portion of a meaningful object was suggested {{on the outside of the}} border of some of the novel <b>silhouettes</b> but not others M(+) Ground and M-Ground novel <b>silhouettes,</b> respectively). This manipulation was intended to induce greater inhibitory competition for figural status from the groundside in M(+) Ground <b>silhouettes</b> than M(-) Ground <b>silhouettes.</b> In previous studies, young adults classified M(+) Ground <b>silhouettes</b> as "novel'' faster than M(-) Ground <b>silhouettes</b> (Trujillo, Allen, Schnyer, & Peterson, 2010), suggesting that young adults may recruit more inhibition to resolve figure-ground when there is more competition. We replicated this effect with young adults in the present study, but older adults showed the opposite pattern and were less accurate in classifying M(+) Ground than M(-) Ground <b>silhouettes.</b> These results extend the evidence for inhibitory deficits in older adults to figure assignment in stationary displays. The (M(+) Ground - M(-) Ground) RT differences were evident in observers' longest responses, consistent with the hypothesis that inhibitory deficits are evident when the need for inhibition is substantial...|$|R

5|$|By the 1850s {{the term}} {{crinoline}} was more usually {{applied to the}} fashionable <b>silhouette</b> provided by horsehair petticoats, and to the hoop skirts that replaced them in the mid-1850s.

In 2007, during her first year of eligibility, Hamm was selected for induction into the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

5|$|In shots {{where there}} was no {{perspective}} change, still shots of the models were photographed and positive paper prints were made.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{approach}} for extracting <b>silhouettes</b> by using a particular pattern that we call the random pattern. The volume intersection method reconstructs the shapes of 3 D objects from their <b>silhouettes</b> obtained with multiple cameras. With the method, if {{some parts of the}} <b>silhouettes</b> are missed, the corresponding parts of the reconstructed shapes are also missed. When colors of the objects and the backgrounds are similar, many parts of the <b>silhouettes</b> are missed. We adopt random pattern backgrounds to extract correct <b>silhouettes.</b> The random pattern has many small re-gions with randomly-selected colors. By using the random pattern backgrounds, we can keep the rate of missing parts below a specied percentage, even for objects of unknown color. To rene the <b>silhouettes,</b> we detect and ll in the miss-ing parts by integrating multiple images. From the images captured by multiple cameras used to observe the object, the object’s colors can be estimated. The missing parts can be detected by comparing the object’s color with its corre-sponding background’s color. In our experiments, we con-rmed that this method effectively extracts <b>silhouettes</b> and reconstructs 3 D shapes. 1...|$|R

He has a goat-like beard and horns, and stands in <b>silhouette,</b> accentuating his heavy body and gaping mouth, which is depicted as if he is screaming.

Tandy read each text before he began sketching, so his early covers were closely connected to specific scenes in the plots.

40|$|International audienceOne {{important}} {{research area}} in Non-Photorealistic Rendering is to obtain <b>silhouettes.</b> There are many methods to obtain <b>silhouettes</b> from 3 d models and raster structures, {{but they are}} limited {{in their ability to}} draw stylized <b>silhouettes</b> with complete flexibility. These limitations do not exist in illustration, as each element is plane and the interaction between them can be eliminated locating each one in a different layer. This is the approach that we present in this paper: a 3 D model is flatted in plane elements ordered in space, which allows us to draw the <b>silhouettes</b> with total flexibility...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new method for obtaining non-photorealistic images. These images have two main visual {{components:}} <b>silhouettes</b> and non-realistic colouring. <b>Silhouettes</b> are lines {{that define the}} form of an object. They are used in classical animation and illustration as the main expressive components. In these applications, if it is necessary, colouring can be added once the drawings are made. For instance, generally, in illustration, colouring is flat and does not transmit volume information whilst <b>silhouettes</b> do it in an economical way. The proposed method is based on the Virtual Lights model, which allows us to use external components, the virtual lights, to define <b>silhouettes.</b> In this way, the designer is free to control where, when and how the <b>silhouettes</b> must appear. The method can be used with B-rep geometric models...|$|R

They are used to identify natural objects such as trees, insects and dinosaurs. They are used in forensic science.|$|R

France officially protested this issue, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo. After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted. Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2½ Euros. Legally only valid within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 Euros.
