[...] "I'd {{not have}} had that <b>sea-chest</b> {{in the house for}} any money; I'll warrant he'd come racketing after it at nights, and making a haunted house of the inn. And as to his going to sea on his chest, I recollect what happened to Skipper Onderdonk's ship on his voyage from Amsterdam.|$|E

40|$|It was {{originally}} maintained by Naunyn that, with very rare exceptions, {{the underlying cause}} of diabetes was an inborn biologic inferiori-ty, primarily of the pancreatic reserve. Recently, Joslin 27 has written, "Ever increasing evidence points strongly to {{the validity of the}} Naunyn conception of the unilty of diabetes with heredity as the common bond. " Wilder 41 opens his discussion of the pathogenesis with the heading: "The primary cause of diabetes; inadequate insular reserve. " Today most authorities accept this unitary pancreatic hypothesis. It is assumed that upon this inherited tendency there must be superimposed factors which at a given time in the individual's life become prominent enough to precipitate the disease. The development of diabetes in the predisposed is due to a variety of causes. In the first place there are hereditary or acquired conditions which reduce the insular reserve. Secondly, there are hereditary or acquired disorders of metabolism which, by creating a greater demand for insulin, impose an added strain on the island cells. As Long 30 has said, the sum of all this is that insulin deficiency, either relative or absolute, appears to play the central role in this disease. In order to define {{the extent to which the}} generally accepted theory of dia!betes is supported, I shall discuss the inheritance of diabetes and the factors precipitating the disease. It is well to recall that much is still unknown about diabetes, that favorite facts can still be challenged, and that deduction from laboratory experiment has certain limitations. This presentation will, therefore, attempt to draw a picture, which is by no means the final one, of the pathogenesis of this disease. How is the inheritance of an inadequate insulin reserve manifested? In descrilbing this I shall adopt the view that the knowledge of diabetes must be examined for its relation to the theory of inherited inferiority. In addition to the direct evidence that diabetes is inherited, physiology and pathology will be <b>sea-ched</b> for facts having a possible bearing on the relationship of heredity to pancreatic or pituitary dysfunction...|$|R
60|$|The {{first thing}} I saw when I {{got back to}} the ship was Ransome on the quarter-deck sitting quietly on his neatly lashed <b>sea-chest.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Wapping Old Stairs?" [...] {{said the}} rough individual, {{shouldering}} the bran-new <b>sea-chest,</b> and starting {{off at a}} trot with it; [...] "yus, I know the place, captin. Fust v’y’ge, sir?" ...|$|E
60|$|The quadrant-case and <b>sea-chest</b> in {{the next}} room proved it to be the skipper's, without the {{additional}} testimony of the oiled-cloth coat and sou'-wester hanging from a peg in the wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{there was}} a tantalus {{containing}} brandy and whisky on the <b>sea-chest.</b> It is of no importance to us, however, since the decanters were full, and it had therefore not been used." ...|$|E
60|$|Placing it in {{the custody}} of a sailor, he {{returned}} below and was helped up with his <b>sea-chest</b> by the steward. In turn, he helped the steward up with the Ancient Mariner's <b>sea-chest.</b> Next, aided by anxious sailors, he and Daughtry dropped into the lazarette through the cabin floor, and began breaking out and passing up a stream of supplies--cases of salmon and beef, of marmalade and biscuit, of butter and preserved milk, and of all sorts of the tinned, desiccated, evaporated, and condensed stuff that of modern times goes down to the sea in ships for the nourishment of men.|$|E
60|$|So saying, {{he got a}} man {{to carry}} his <b>sea-chest,</b> himself {{shouldered}} the bundle, Gillie was intrusted with the full-rigged model, and thus laden they left the scene followed by another laugh and a hearty cheer.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{your mother}} has your <b>sea-chest</b> all ready, my lad, {{and you can}} travel down with me to-morrow; for if you are {{to be one of}} Nelson's men, you must show him that you are worthy of it." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently the Captain re{{appeared}} at {{the window}} and lowered a huge <b>sea-chest.</b> A third time he appeared with the model of a full-rigged ship in his hand. This time he let the end of the rope down, and then getting over the window, slid easily to the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I won't refuse that, Jim; see, I am {{prepared}} to go," [...] she said, pointing to a wooden <b>sea-chest</b> which {{stood in the middle}} of the room; [...] "my box is packed. Everything I own is in it. The furniture, clock, and bedding belong to the landlord." ...|$|E
6000|$|GAUNT. They {{call me a}} miser. They {{say that}} in this <b>sea-chest</b> of mine I hoard my gold. (He passes R. to chest, takes out key and unlocks it.) They think my {{treasure}} and my very soul are locked up here. They speak after the flesh, but they are right. See! ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{kitchen was}} clean and ample, with a great open {{fireplace}} and wide stone hearth, and oven on one side, and rows of old-fashioned splint-bottomed chairs against the wall. A table scoured to snowy whiteness, and a little work-stand whereon lay the Bible, the [...] "Missionary Herald" [...] and the [...] "Weekly Christian Mirror," [...] before named, formed the principal furniture. One feature, however, must not be forgotten,--a great <b>sea-chest,</b> which had been the companion of Zephaniah through all {{the countries of the}} earth. Old, and battered, and unsightly it looked, yet report said that there was good store within of that which men for the most part respect more than anything else; and, indeed, it proved often when a deed of grace was to be done,--when a woman was suddenly made a widow in a coast gale, or a fishing-smack was run down in the fogs off the banks, leaving in some neighboring cottage a family of orphans,--in all such cases, the opening of this <b>sea-chest</b> was an event of good omen to the bereaved; for Zephaniah had a large heart and a large hand, and was apt to take it out full of silver dollars when once it went in. So the ark of the covenant could not have been looked on with more reverence than the neighbors usually showed to Captain Pennel's <b>sea-chest.</b>|$|E

60|$|I {{must not}} omit to mention another report, also, which I confess is rather apocryphal, of the buccaneer, who was {{supposed}} to have been drowned, being seen before daybreak, with a lanthorn in his hand, seated astride his great <b>sea-chest</b> and sailing through Hell Gate, which just then began to roar and bellow with redoubled fury.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank'ee, lass," [...] {{said the}} captain, as he {{set down the}} <b>sea-chest</b> and seated himself thereon; [...] "they're pretty enough to look at, d'ye see, but they're raither in the way just now, as my second mate once said of the rocks when we were {{cruising}} {{off the coast of}} Norway in search of a pilot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had a sort {{of vision}} of my lodgings--in the North of London, too, beyond Dalston, away to the devil--and all my gear {{scattered}} about, and my empty <b>sea-chest</b> somewhere in an outhouse the good people I was staying with had {{at the end of their}} sooty strip of garden.

60|$|The {{only people}} {{in the village of}} Barnbury, who {{thoroughly}} enjoyed the Christmas of that year, were the baker, his wife, and the sailor brother. And a rare good time they had; for a big <b>sea-chest</b> arrived, and there were curious presents, and a tall flask of rare old wine, and plenty of time for three merry people to cook for themselves.|$|E
60|$|The {{simplicity}} of the contrivance to secure a furred pouch, {{which could have been}} ripped open without any attempt on the spring, reminded me of the verses in the Odyssey, where Ulysses, in a yet ruder age, is content to secure his property by casting a curious and involved complication of cordage around the <b>sea-chest</b> in which it was deposited.|$|E

"My dear Miss Gordon," [...] exclaimed {{the poor}} woman, kissing Lizzie's {{hand in the}} fulness of her heart, [...] "you've no ideer what agonies I've bin a-sufferin' in that there bank. If they're a-goin' to treat me in this way always, I'll draw out the whole o' my ten hundred {{thousand}} pound--if that's the sum--an' stow it away in my Stephen's <b>sea-chest,</b> what he's left behind him." ...|$|E
60|$|The King's discomfiture was pitiful: {{he retired}} at once {{from the capital}} and passed a whole year {{pasturing}} his flock of tigers in the solitudes beyond the River of Wine. Seeing that I would henceforth be persona non grata at the palace, I sought obscurity in the writing and publication of books. In this vocation I was greatly assisted by a few standard works that had been put ashore with me in my <b>sea-chest.</b>|$|E
60|$|Every tiny {{apartment}} {{showed signs}} of recent occupancy. A <b>sea-chest,</b> clothes hanging on the walls, and such belongings as a sailor would deem necessary for a long voyage, could be seen. In one state-room was a set of gold studs and sleeve-buttons and a new quadrant. In another, which Jim confidently asserted was the captain's, a watch hung {{at the head of}} the berth, while a small writing-desk was littered with papers.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{boatswain}} {{died during}} a storm, so they wrapped {{him up in}} a sheet, {{and put him in}} his own <b>sea-chest,</b> and threw him overboard; but they neglected in their hurry-skurry to say prayers over him--and the storm raged and roared louder than ever, and they saw the dead man seated in his chest, with his shroud for a sail, coming hard after the ship; and the sea breaking before him in great sprays like fire, and there they kept scudding day after day and night after night, expecting every moment to go to wreck; and every night they saw the dead boatswain in his <b>sea-chest</b> trying to get up with them, and they heard his whistle above the blasts of wind, and he seemed to send great seas mountain high after them, that would have swamped the ship if they had not put up the dead lights. And so it went on till they lost sight of him in the fogs of Newfoundland, and supposed he had veered ship and stood for Dead Man's Isle. So much for burying a man at sea without saying prayers over him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{have been}} doing some trading, captain,” he whispered to him. “It is white plunder; and I {{have no doubt that}} a ship has been {{surprised}} and her crew massacred somewhere near here. I have bought the chronometers and quadrants, and they have certainly not been in the water; also the contents of a <b>sea-chest,</b> which I divided among the men. There were no papers of any kind, but from the appearance of the chronometers, I should say that they cannot have been here long.” ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{the window}} of the room {{overhead}} was opened, and a loud halloo uttered by the mysterious stranger. Several hailings passed from one party to the other, but in a language which none of the company in the bar-room could understand; and presently they heard the window closed, and a great noise overhead as if all the furniture were pulled and hauled about the room. The negro servant was summoned, and shortly after was seen assisting the veteran to lug the ponderous <b>sea-chest</b> down stairs.|$|E
60|$|He emptied his mug, and then, {{accompanied}} by Mr. Wright, fetched his <b>sea-chest</b> from the boarding-house {{where he was}} staying, {{and took it to}} the young man's lodgings. Fortunately for the latter's pocket the chest contained a good best suit and boots, and the only expenses incurred were for a large, soft felt hat and a gilded watch and chain. Dressed in his best, with a bulging pocket-book in his breast-pocket, he set out with Mr. Wright on the following evening to make his first call.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was easy}} {{enough for him}} to talk of getting ready in six hours for a voyage that was not to exceed two years. He hadn't to do that trick himself, and with his <b>sea-chest</b> locked up in an {{outhouse}} the key of which had been mislaid for a week as I remembered. But neither was I much concerned. The idea that I was absolutely going to sea at six o'clock next morning hadn't got quite into my head yet. It had been too sudden.|$|E
6000|$|I {{remember}} {{him as if}} it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door, his <b>sea-chest</b> following behind him in a hand-barrow--a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid white. I {{remember him}} looking round the cover and whistling to himself as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards: ...|$|E
6000|$|Lingard {{stood the}} lantern on the table. Its light was very poor. He dropped {{on to the}} <b>sea-chest</b> heavily. He, too, was over-wrought. His flannel shirt was open at the neck. He had a broad belt round his waist and was without his jacket. Before him, Mrs. Travers, {{straight}} and tall in the gay silks, cottons, and muslins of her outlandish dress, with {{the ends of the}} scarf thrown over her head, hanging down in front of her, looked dimly splendid and with a black glance out of her white face. He said: ...|$|E
6000|$|At last came a suggestion,--What if {{they should}} start off {{together}} some fine day, [...] "just for a spree," [...] and try a cruise in the West Indies, {{to see what they}} could pick up? They had arms, and a gang of fine, whole-souled fellows. Moses had been tied to Ma'am Pennel's apron-string long enough. And [...] "hark ye," [...] said one of them, [...] "Moses, they say old Pennel has lots of dollars in that old <b>sea-chest</b> of his'n. It would be a kindness to him to invest them for him in an adventure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Confusion! is {{the cup to}} be {{for ever}} dashed from my lips?" [...] muttered Richard; but {{recovering}} his composure, by exertion of the self-command, of which he possessed so large a portion, he desired Hartley to proceed with his communication. Hartley accordingly proceeded to inform him of the particulars preceding his birth, and those which followed after it; while Middlemas, seated on a <b>sea-chest,</b> listened with inimitable composure to a tale which went to root up the flourishing hopes of wealth which he had lately so fondly entertained.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{came in a}} storm, and he went in a storm; he came in the night, and he went in the night; he came {{nobody knows}} from whence, and he has gone nobody knows where. For aught I know he has gone to sea once more {{on his chest and}} may land to bother some {{people on the other side}} of the world! Though it's a {{thousand}} pities," [...] added the landlord, [...] "if he has gone to Davy Jones that he had not left his <b>sea-chest</b> behind him." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{belongings}} {{were packed}} snugly in a <b>sea-chest,</b> and I was {{all ready to}} buy my ticket and ride down on the train to Oakland, when Neil Partington arrived in Benicia. The Reindeer was needed immediately for work far down on the Lower Bay, and Neil said he intended to run straight for Oakland. As that was his home and as I was {{to live with his}} family while going to school, he saw no reason, he said, why I should not put my chest aboard and come along.|$|E
6000|$|Master Leigh {{considered}} him a moment. [...] "Sets the wind so!" [...] said he at length, and {{without another word}} he rose {{and went to a}} <b>sea-chest</b> ranged against the wooden wall of the cabin. He opened it and took thence a leather bag. From this he produced a handful of jewels. He thrust them under Sir Oliver's nose. [...] "Haply," [...] said he, [...] "ye'll be acquainted with some of them. They was given me to make up the sum since your brother had not the whole two hundred pound in coin. Take a look at them." ...|$|E
