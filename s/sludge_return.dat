30|$|The {{conventional}} (plug flow) {{activated sludge}} process uses an aeration tank, a settling tank (clarifier), and a <b>sludge</b> <b>return</b> line to treat wastewater. Wastewater and return sludge from the secondary clarifier enter {{the head of}} the aeration tank to undergo a specific period of aeration. The main characteristic of a plug flow configuration is a high ratio of organic loading (i.e., F/M) to the mixed liquor {{at the beginning of the}} tank. There is little longitudinal mixing in a plug flow tank except for that which is caused by diffused aeration; therefore, as the liquor flows through its length, substrate is used up and the mass of microorganisms increases due to cell reproduction. If the F/M is sufficiently low in the latter stages of the tank, much of the oxygen is consumed by nitrification and endogenous respiration. The lack of longitudinal mixing reduces the ability to handle shock loads; there is little dilution of the inflow so microorganisms may be affected by toxic material. Plug flow has the advantage of discouraging the excessive growth of filamentous organisms which can cause settlement problems in the secondary settlement tank (EPA 1997).|$|E

SIR (%) is the percentage by volume of <b>sludge</b> <b>returned</b> from the external reactor into the main bioreactor of the OSA, and was varied from 0 - 22 %. OSA achieved greater sludge reduction when fed with unsettled sewage (sCOD= 113 mg/L) rather than settled sewage (sCOD= 60 mg/L). The SIR of 11 % resulted in the highest OSA performance. At the optimum SIR, higher volatile solids destruction and nitrification/denitrification (i. e., conversion of destroyed volatile solids into inert forms) were observed in the external anoxic and intermittently aerated (i. e., aerobic/anoxic) reactors, respectively. Denitrification in the aerobic/anoxic reactor was inefficient without SIR. Effluent quality and sludge settleability were unaffected by SIR...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Wastewater {{treatment}} plants, {{especially those}} employing secondary treatment and anaerobic sludge digestion, have historically encountered phosphate precipitates, {{one of the}} commonest being struvite, that foul and encrust the <b>sludge</b> <b>return</b> lines, and the associated pumps and valves. This growth of ‘uncontrolled ’ struvite increases pumping and maintenance cost, as well as reduces the overall capacity of the plant piping system in terms of lost hydraulic capacity and lowered biological treatment capacity. Although uncontrolled formation of struvite can be a nuisance, however, controlled production of struvite can prove beneficial to treatment plants. This is accomplished through reducing maintenance costs, {{as well as providing}} extra revenue from the sale of the struvite crystals as fertilizers. This paper investigates what can and should be done before struvite-related problems hamper efficient operation of the treatment plant. A case study carried out at a wastewater treatment plant showed the influence of nutrient loading in cases where nutrient treatment is not carried out. The three locations investigated all has a supersaturation value greater than unity; this indicated that struvite formation potential was high.

This process is aerobic and acts by using a sludge blanket in the separator of sedimentation tank. All biological flocs and suspended solids, which are presented in the aeration basin, pas through this blanket. The performance of a single stage USBF process for treatment of domestic wastewater was studied in laboratory scale.

40|$|Landfill {{leachate}} {{is complex}} waste water with considerable variation in both quality and quantity. The composition and {{concentration of pollutants}} {{are influenced by the}} types of waste deposited, hydro geological factors and more significant by the age of the landfill site. In general, leachate is highly contaminated with organic contaminants measured as chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and also with high ammonium nitrogen concentration. Aerobic biological processes have been found the most effective and reliable treatment option of landfill leachate for developing country like Bangladesh. Leachate containing high concentrations of organic and nitrogen compounds results serious environmental problems near the landfill site. This research was undertaken to investigate the performance of both chemical treatment by alum coagulation and biological process that is extended–aeration activated sludge process without <b>sludge</b> <b>return</b> and anaerobic treatment of Savar Landfill leachate containing high organic and nitrogen concentrations. The main part of the study was studied on the removal efficiency of BOD, COD and ammonia in each method and heavy metals removal were also studied in coagulation and flocculation method. It is observed that in extended aeration process BOD removal is around 80 % at 6 days detention time and 94 % at 15 days detention time. In the same treatment method experiment results reveal that 75 % of ammonia removal is achieved in 6 days aeration period mainly due to air stripping process and in total 98 % removal is achieved in 15 days aeration period. The optimum pH of alum coagulant for leachate treatment was 6. 5. Also an effective dosage of alum is 1. 4 g/L for the best efficiency of heavy metals and COD removal. The maximum amount of COD and heavy metals that could be removed by the alum was about 21 and 77 - 91 % of the initial value, respectively. It is also found that anaerobic biological treatment alone cannot efficiently remove the COD content of leachate from the site. BOD/COD ratio was varies from 0. 19 to 0. 14 in anaerobic batch system for 20 and 41 days, respectively. This BOD/COD ratio means low biodegradability of treated leachate.

40|$|Treatment and {{disposal}} of excess sludge produced in an activated sludge process has become an environmental challenge in densely populated urban areas due to difficulty to locate suitable sites for landfill and incineration. Therefore, reduction/minimization of excess sludge within activated sludge processes may be an ideal solution. This study focuses {{on the use of}} a modified activated sludge process, named the oxic-settling-anaerobic (OSA) system, to achieve an effective reduction in excess sludge production. Its key feature is to insert a sludge holding tank in the <b>sludge</b> <b>return</b> circuit to provide an anaerobic sludge zone. The objectives of the study are to: 1) demonstrate the excess sludge reduction in an OSA system; 2) evaluate the appropriate operating conditions; and 3) study the mechanisms of excess sludge reduction, so as to maximize the excess sludge reduction efficiency of the OSA system. In continuous-flow studies, an OSA system was operated in parallel with an activated sludge process as a reference system to investigate the effects of the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) level and the sludge anaerobic exposure time (SAET) in the sludge holding tank on the sludge reduction. The intended level of ORP was maintained by periodical pure nitrogen purging thus preventing the pH drop by chasing the gaseous product in the sludge holding tank. SAET was regulated by changing the pumping rate of the return sludge from settling tank. In batch studies, proposed mechanisms involving soluble microbial products (SMPs) effects, microbial population effects and sludge decay effects were verified. In addition, a COD balance was carried out to supplement the understanding of the mechanisms. The main findings of my research are : 1) the OSA system had a lower sludge yield and oxygen demand than the reference system under the same solids quantity condition, which demonstrated that an OSA system could provide a cost-effective solution for excess sludge reduction; 2) the OSA system improved COD removal efficiency and sludge settleability; 3) a low ORP in the sludge holding tank favored the excess sludge reduction; 4) low sludge growth yield, soluble microbial products (SMPs) effect and microbial predator contribution were unable to explain the excess sludge reduction; and 5) the excess sludge reduction in an OSA system was mainly due to increased sludge decay in the sludge holding tank under an anaerobic condition and the utilization of COD generated from the sludge decay through denitrification, sulfate reduction, phosphorus release and volatile organic gas production that occurred in the sludge holding tank of the OSA system, among which, the contribution of gaseous production was significant.

Also, because of importance of this type of contaminants in soil and food products, continuous monitoring by water companies is highly necessary. © 2017, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) {{emission}} {{data collected}} from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) show huge variations between plants and within one plant (both spatially and temporarily). Such variations and the relative contributions of various N 2 O production pathways are not fully understood. This study applied a previously established N 2 O model incorporating two currently known N 2 O production pathways by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) (namely the AOB denitrification and the hydroxylamine pathways) and the N 2 O production pathway by heterotrophic denitrifiers to describe and provide insights into the large spatial variations of N 2 O fluxes in a step-feed full-scale activated sludge plant. The model was calibrated and validated by comparing simulation results with 40 days of N 2 O emission monitoring data {{as well as other}} water quality parameters from the plant. The model demonstrated that the relatively high biomass specific nitrogen loading rate in the Second Step of the reactor was responsible for the much higher N 2 O fluxes from this section. The results further revealed the AOB denitrification pathway decreased and the NH 2 OH oxidation pathway increased along the path of both Steps due to the increasing dissolved oxygen concentration. The overall N 2 O emission from this step-feed WWTP would be largely mitigated if 30 % of the <b>returned</b> <b>sludge</b> were <b>returned</b> to the Second Step to reduce its biomass nitrogen loading rate.
