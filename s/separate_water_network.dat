40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an approach to}} designing a large-scale water system, which integrates water-using operations and wastewater treatment units in different production sections within the same network. This approach uses a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for water reuse and regeneration reuse in batch and semicontinuous processes. The application of this mathematical formulation to large-scale industrial problems with changing daily production schedule leads to huge and complex mathematical models. Two alternative multilevel strategies are proposed to solve such problems by means of temporal decomposition. The approach is illustrated with a brewery case study that integrates water consumers in two production sections. The results obtained show that, despite the high piping cost, integration of both sections yields better result than the <b>separate</b> <b>water</b> <b>network</b> design in each section. © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) ...|$|E

Two <b>separate</b> <b>water</b> distribution <b>networks</b> were studied; network 1 which supplies the surgical intensive care units, and network 2 which supplies the medical intensive care units and the emergency room. Network 1 has been disinfected by ozonation since 1995, and network 2 has been disinfected by ionisation since 1999. The hot water temperature was increased from 50 to 65 degrees C in 1998 and 2000 in networks 1 and 2, respectively. Water samples and swabs of the water outlets were cultured for Legionella spp. between four and six times each year, providing data before and after implementation of the disinfection procedures. There {{was no significant difference}} in the proportion of samples positive for Legionella spp. after ozonation in network 1 or after ionization in network 2. In both networks, there was a significant reduction in legionella isolates after increasing the hot water temperature to 65 degrees C.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} faucets as a reservoir for Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization/infection of patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs). DESIGN: Prospective epidemiological investigation performed during a nonepidemic period of 1 year. The inner part of the ICU faucets were swabbed for P. aeruginosa. Data were recorded on all patients {{with at least one}} culture of a clinical specimens positive for P. aeruginosa. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to characterize the strains. SETTING: Five ICUs of a university hospital which are supplied by two <b>separate</b> <b>water</b> distribution <b>networks.</b> PATIENTS: During a 1 -year period 132 cases were investigated. RESULTS: In 42 % of cases (56 / 132) there were isolates identical to those found in the faucets, with a total of nine different genotypes. Among the nine genotypes isolated from both patients and faucets one of them, the most prevalent, was isolated in the two networks and in 30 cases. The other eight genotypes were recovered almost exclusively from either one (three genotypes in 12 cases) or the other (five genotypes in 12 cases) network and from the patients in the corresponding ICUs. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the water system of the ICUs was the primary reservoir of patient's colonization/infection with P. aeruginosa in a substantial proportion of patients, although the exact mode of acquisition could not be determined...|$|R

40|$|With the {{eye-catching}} {{advances in}} sensing technologies, smart <b>water</b> <b>networks</b> have been attracting immense research interest in recent years. One {{of the most}} overarching tasks in smart <b>water</b> <b>network</b> management is the reduction of water loss (such as leaks and bursts in a pipe network). In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme to position water loss event based on <b>water</b> <b>network</b> topology. The state-of-the-art approach to this problem, however, utilizes the limited topology information of the <b>water</b> <b>network,</b> that is, only one single shortest path between two sensor locations. Consequently, the accuracy of positioning water loss events is still less desirable. To resolve this problem, our scheme consists of two key ingredients: First, we design a novel graph topology-based measure, which can recursively quantify the "average distances" for all pairs of senor locations simultaneously in a <b>water</b> <b>network.</b> This measure will substantially improve the accuracy of our positioning strategy, by capturing the entire <b>water</b> <b>network</b> topology information between every two sensor locations, yet without any sacrifice of computational efficiency. Then, we devise an efficient search algorithm that combines the "average distances" with {{the difference in the}} arrival times of the pressure variations detected at sensor locations. The viable experimental evaluations on real-world test bed (WaterWiSe@SG) demonstrate that our proposed positioning scheme can identify water loss event more accurately than the best-known competitor...|$|R
40|$|Background: The direct {{modeling}} of <b>water</b> <b>networks</b> {{is not a}} common practice in modern epidemiology. While space often serves as a proxy, it can be problematic. There are multiple ways to directly model <b>water</b> <b>networks,</b> but these methods are not straightforward and {{can be difficult to}} implement. This study suggests a simple approach for modeling <b>water</b> <b>networks</b> and diseases, and applies this method to a dataset of self-reported gastrointestinal conditions from a questionnaire-based population health survey in central Norway. Method: Our approach is based on a standard conditional autoregressive (CAR) model. An inverse matrix was constructed, with nodes weighted based on the distance to neighboring nodes within the networks. This matrix was then fitted as a generic model. To illustrate its possible use, we utilized data taken from a questionnaire-based population health survey, the HUNT Study, to measure self-reported gastrointestinal complaints. For hypothesis testing, we used the deviance information criterion (DIC) and included variables in a stepwise manner. Results: The full model converged after six hours. We found no relation between the <b>water</b> <b>networks</b> and the health conditions of people whose residences connected to different parts of the network in the geographical area studied. Conclusion: All <b>water</b> <b>network</b> models are simplifications of the real networks.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{industrial applications}} of pinch analysis techniques in energy optimisation and wastewater minimisation {{have resulted in}} the recent studies of combined mass and heat integration. Kim and Smith (2001) have demonstrated that operation of cooling <b>water</b> <b>networks</b> in series, rather than the conventional parallel arrangement improve cooling tower and cooling <b>water</b> <b>network</b> performance in new and retrofit design. In this work, utilising a superstructure to determine the mathematical formulation that characterises a cooling <b>water</b> <b>network</b> supplied by multiple cooling water sources, which often occurs in practice, extends this methodology. It is further demonstrated that the optimum cooling water supply to a network of cooling-water-using operations supplied by multiple sources is determined by considering the entire framework of sources and cooling-water-using operations, that is, unified targeting. This optimum is better than that obtained from considering individual subsets of cooling-water-using operations and its respective source, that is, single source targeting. Relevant practical constraints were included in the formulations to enhance robustness and applicability to real life situations. Practical constraints consisted of maximum return temperatures to cooling water sources, as wells as dedicated water sources and sinks of cooling-water-using operations. This concept was applied to an illustrative example and a case study of the Sasol Synfuels (Pty) Limited cooling water system that consisted of individual <b>networks</b> supplied by <b>separate</b> <b>water</b> sources. For the case with maximum water reuse the single source targeting method yielded an improvement of 11. 6 % over the parallel target for the illustrative example. In comparison, superior results were obtained with the developed unified targeting method, which yielded an improvement of 18. 4 %. Likewise, for the case with the aforementioned practical constraints 6. 8 % and 7. 6 % improvements were forecasted for the single source and unified targeting methods respectively. For the maximum reuse scenario of the case study, improvements of 37. 9 % and 41. 0 % over the parallel target were obtained using the single source and unified targeting methods, respectively. Similarly, considering practical constraints improvements of 20. 3 % and 31. 1 % were obtained. In both the illustrative example and case study the unified targeting method resulted in superior results than the single source targeting methods.
