In order to assess the effect of storm movement while eliminating variations in other factors that also influence the runoff response, the only parameters that were varied were storm velocity and direction.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{presents}} theoretical analysis of an engineering mixed lubrication contact in one-dimensional case between a deformable plane of regular roughness and an ideally <b>smooth</b> rigid <b>plane.</b> The roughness of the plane, respectively take {{the forms of}} triangle and truncated triangle ridges which are evenly distributed on the <b>plane</b> <b>surface.</b> The rough <b>plane</b> is assumed as elastic-plastic. The contact between {{the tip of the}} ridge on the plane and the other <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> is assumed as in dry contact or oxidized chemical boundary layer contact, while the regions between other parts of the ridge and the <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> are, respectively in physical adsorbed boundary layer contact and continuum film hydrodynamic contact. The lubricant in the continuum film hydrodynamic contact is assumed as Newtonian. The whole contact between these two planes is obtained by periodically distributing the ridge on the plane. Theoretical analysis are developed for this mode of contact, respectively for triangle and truncated triangle surface ridges for wide operational parameters when the plane ridge, respectively undergoes elastic and plastic deformations and the hydrodynamic contact areas between the planes are varied. The present study demonstrates the theoretical analysis. In the following parts will be demonstrated the results obtained from the present analysis...|$|R

Characterization techniques of XRD, SEM and UV-visible spectra measurements {{were performed to}} investigate the effects of Co doping on the structural and optical properties of ZnCoO thin films. The deposited films were annealed at 350 0 C and 400 0 C respectively for one hour and similar characterization techniques were performed. The XRD patterns of all the films showed crystalline behavior and were of hexagonal wurtzite structure. Heat treatment improved the crystallinity of the deposited films. The SEM study performed after annealing at 400 0 C showed that incorporation of Cobalt changes the surface morphology of ZnO films from a <b>plane</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> to a rough wrinkled network.

40|$|Can a <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> cubic {{be defined}} by the {{determinant}} of a square matrix with entries in linear forms in three variables? If we can, we say that it admits a linear determinantal representation. In this paper, we investigate linear determinantal representations of <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> cubics over various fields, and prove that any <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> cubic over a large field (or an ample field) admits a linear determinantal representation. Since local fields are large, any <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> cubic over a local field always admits a linear determinantal representation. As an application, we prove that a positive proportion of <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> cubics over Q, ordered by height, admit linear determinantal representations. We also prove that, if the conjecture of Bhargava-Kane-Lenstra-Poonen-Rains {{on the distribution of}} Selmer groups is true, a positive proportion of <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> cubics over Q fail the local-global principle for the existence of linear determinantal representations.

40|$|Rock {{reinforcing}} elements {{provide a}} significant proportion of their ground control capability through offering resistance to shear movement of adjacent rock masses or blocks. This potential shear movement may take the form of sliding on horizontal bedding planes leading to strata bending; or block displacement along other geological structures such as joints or similar discontinuities. Much has been reported about this type of behaviour of rock bolts and other tendons, in theoretical concepts. However, {{there is a shortage of}} quality data available on the exact nature of this mechanism for shear resistance, and the role played by parameters such as pre-tensioning. A clearer understanding of the nature and significance of this type of behaviour has major implications for rock reinforcing materials and installation design. This thesis, which was supported by the Australian Coal Research Program (ACARP) describes the design, construction and commissioning of a laboratory testing facility at the School of Mining Engineering, University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia and a subsequent testing program. The single failure plane design adopted in the test rig has been successful in allowing shear loading to be directly applied to fully installed rockbolts. Rockbolts were installed into an offset concrete rockmass, which consisted of two separate concrete samples that created a <b>smooth</b> shear <b>plane</b> <b>surface.</b> The reinforced samples were subjected to an applied shear load and critical parameters such as load and shear displacement were recorded. Influencing parameters such as concrete strength and applied pre-tension were altered and recorded to determine their effects on the overall shear performance of the sample. The failure mode of the rockbolts was also examined. The results indicate that a relative stronger rockmass material caused the rockbolt to fail within a lower shear displacement compared to a relatively weaker material. Also, a pre-tensioned rockbolt tended to resist shear displacement at least initially, until high shear loads developed. This phenomena is beneficial to ground support as less movement would tend to maintain integral strength of the rockmass. The use of strain-gauged rockbolts indicated as would be expected that the shear loading arrangement induced a compressive axial loading that tended to dissipate with distance from the shear surface...|$|R
