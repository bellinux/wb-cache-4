40|$|Recognizing the {{importance}} of lexis and vocabulary learning strategies (VLS) in academic studies, this article presents a descriptive case study of technical vocabulary learning in English over one academic term in an intact, required first year course in a graduate school of theology in Canada. After outlining background information and describing the research methods, the article discusses the vocabulary learning strategies and success of five non-native (NNES) and six native English speaker (NES) participants. Data were collected using pre- and post-Tests of Theological Language (TTL), through mid- and end-of-term interviews, {{and at the end}} of the course using an Approach to Vocabulary Learning Questionnaire. Analyses addressed the VLS that NNES and NES students use in learning the technical vocabulary of their discipline, how these VLS may be classified in relation to previous research, what types of words participants report learning, and whether a particular approach to or strategy in technical vocabulary learning predicts <b>success</b> <b>in</b> <b>acquisition,</b> as reflected in scores on the TTL. Results indicate that participants used a variety of VLS, though no one strategy appeared to dominate. Detailed portraits of participants’ approaches to technical vocabulary learning are included. While there were no consistent trends in approaches to or strategies in success on the TTL, overall participants who approached their technical vocabulary learning in an unstructured manner tended to obtain higher scores on the TTL. In terms of growth in depth of vocabulary knowledge, however, TTL results suggest that a structured approach may be helpful for NNESs...|$|E

40|$|Background. This article {{reveals the}} {{importance}} of studying the problem of <b>success</b> <b>in</b> foreign language <b>acquisition</b> during the rst stage of study in the modern educational environment. Particular {{attention is paid to}} factors of successful foreign language acquisition during the primary-school ages, which depends on cognitive style features, such as reaction type and cognitive control. e content and characteristics of cognitive styles as individual styles of foreign language <b>acquisition</b> are analyzed <b>in</b> the context of a leading activity of primary school students. Objective. A hypothesis of this research was that <b>success</b> <b>in</b> foreign language <b>acquisition</b> depends on reaction type and cognitive control, particularly the extent of the cognitive styles of impulsivity, re exivity, rigidity and exibility in primary-school students. Design. To implement the proposed empirical tasks, the author organized and conducted research using a combination of methods intended to study the correlation between <b>success</b> <b>in</b> foreign language <b>acquisition</b> by primary-school students and reaction type as well as the features of cognitive control. A total of 74 elementary-school pupils aged 8 - 11 years were studied. A direct connection between <b>success</b> <b>in</b> foreign language <b>acquisition</b> and the indicators of the cognitive style “impulsivity — re exivity” was iden- ti ed using mathematical statistics methods. Results. This study found no statistically signi cant correlation between <b>success</b> <b>in</b> foreign language <b>acquisition</b> and the indicators of the cognitive style “rigidity — exibility”. erefore, the results con rm that <b>success</b> <b>in</b> foreign language <b>acquisition</b> at prima- ry-school ages is determined more by reaction type (impulsive or re exive) than by the features of cognitive control (rigidity or exibility). Conclusion: The practical significance of the study is that the obtained results can be used in the work of teachers and psychologists to improve the educational process in primary school and to promote the e ective study of foreign language by students...|$|R
40|$|Drawing on {{research}} on the value drivers <b>in</b> mergers and <b>acquisitions,</b> as well as work on knowledge transfer in multinational corporations, we present an integrative model of the socio-cultural antecedents of strategic capability transfer <b>in</b> cross-border <b>acquisitions.</b> Its basic premise is {{that the impact of}} national cultural differences on the strategic capability transfer <b>success</b> <b>in</b> <b>acquisitions</b> is mediated by the degree of social integration, the ability of the acquired organization to absorb capabilities from the acquirer, and the existence of capability complementarities. Under this perspective, cultural differences can be viewed as enhancing the combination potential <b>in</b> <b>acquisitions,</b> as well as a source of social integration problems and difficulties in absorbing capabilities. Furthermore, the model proposes that the perceived attractiveness of the acquirer and the use of formal and informal integration mechanisms affect the capability transfer through their impact on the social integration of the combining organizations. It is argued that this model provides us with an overall framework through which one can better understand the linkages and causal relationships between national cultural differences and capability transfer. Future empirical work is encouraged to validate and/or refine the various testable propositions...|$|R

When competing for territories, some individuals may have an advantage if, for example, they are phenotypically superior or more familiar with the site than others. The relative importance of the many factors involved <b>in</b> territory <b>acquisition</b> is, at present, unclear. We studied patterns of natural territory <b>acquisition</b> <b>in</b> a closed and saturated population of Seychelles warblers. Furthermore, by removing breeders, we experimentally investigated the relative importance, to territory acquisition, of a range of factors and assessed whether this differed between the sexes. In both sexes, the main route to natural territory acquisition was to disperse from the natal territory to immediately claim a vacant dominant position. Males were older than females when acquiring a territory for the first time. In the removal experiment, for both sexes, the proximity of an individual’s natal territory to a vacant dominant position was positively related to the individual’s chance of claiming the vacancy. Older males were more likely to gain an experimental vacant dominant position than were young males, whereas age did not affect territory <b>acquisition</b> <b>in</b> females. In the Seychelles warbler, the degree of intrasexual competition for territory ownership may be stronger for males than for females because territory ownership {{is a prerequisite}} for male reproduction, whereas females can reproduce on their natal territory.

In acquiring meaning, learners face two types of learning situations.

Another type of learning situation is exemplified in less frequent, dispreferred or syntactically complex sentences where the sentential semantics offers no mismatch; these are labelled Complex Syntax—Simple Semantics. Two studies representative of these learning situations are reviewed. A third study attests to the unimportance of explicit instruction with respect to some interpretive properties. Implications of these findings for the critical period issue are discussed.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the acquisition of}} the English lax-tense contrast in front vowels (/i/-//, /e/-//) by adult Catalan learners of English as a second language. The English lax-tense distinction is based on differences in tongue position, duration and phonotactic distribution, where lax vowels are restricted to closed syllables. Importantly, Catalan has a similar vowel height distinction (/i/, /e/, //), but no duration contrast or phonotactic restrictions for vowels. Further, English, but not Catalan, has ambisyllabic consonants. These specific differences raise the following two questions: How do second language learners acquire a novel segmental contrast, and how does the acquisition of nonsegmental information interact with the acquisition of segmental structure? These questions are addressed {{in a series of}} perception, production and psycholinguistic experiments. The perceptual similarity of English and Catalan vowels is assessed to predict relative <b>success</b> <b>in</b> vowel <b>acquisition.</b> Results from perception and production experiments illustrate that perceived similarity alone does not predict the likelihood of accurate perception and production. Specifically, duration, a non-L 1 feature, was used to establish a contrast for a vowel that had no close match in Catalan. This in turn influenced the cues used in th...|$|R
40|$|Three {{issues are}} dealt with: the {{relationship}} between phonetic awareness and reading acquisition, {{the nature of the}} cognitive capacities that make phonetic awareness possible, and the potential influence of phonetic awareness on language perception and comprehension. Data on the relationships between phonetic awareness and reading acquisition support an interactive view. For most people, learning to read in the alphabetic system stimulates phonetic awareness. On the other hand, phonetic awareness is a critical factor for <b>success</b> <b>in</b> reading <b>acquisition.</b> Indications {{about the nature of the}} cognitive capacities that underlie phonetic awareness may be obtained by inspecting its development. Two capacities at least seem to be required: the capacity to ignore meaning and focus on the sound properties of speech and the capacity of segmentation. Lack of phonetic awareness does not imply that phonetic processing does not take place during speech perception. Recent data suggest that speech perception includes a stage of extraction of phonetic features regardless of whether or not the subject is able to segment speech into phones explicitly. However, phonetic awareness may influence perceptual strategies and the relative weight of meaning expectancies in identification. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{relationship}} between the characteristics or attributes of a military weapon system (e. g., speed, reliability, survivability) and the effectiveness of that system is thoroughly examined. <b>Success</b> <b>in</b> system <b>acquisition</b> relies on (1) the early identification and successful incorporation of those system attributes that are critical to system effectiveness, and (2) the specification of numerical values for the system attributes (the system requirements) that maximizes system effectiveness at an acceptable cost. New definitions for system, system attributes, and system effectiveness, as well as relevant DoDI 5000. 2 guidance are provided. In addition to the currently- mandated battle level at which system effectiveness should be measured (in terms of engagement or battle outcomes), the author uses a wide spectrum of system acquisition-related literature to advocate that system effectiveness should also be measured at the mission level (in terms of mission outcome). Several existing mathematical models which combine a few key system attribute measurements into single-number measures of system effectiveness in accomplishing a particular mission are described. Then, the author proposes a hierarchy or tree which relates many system attributes to the four key attributes, Availability, Reliability, Survivability, and Capability, and hence to system effectiveness in accomplishing a specified mission.

40|$|This {{book reviews}} recent {{research}} on the second language acquisition of meaning {{with a view of}} establishing whether there is a critical period for the acquisition of compositional semantics. A modular approach to language architecture is assumed. The book addresses the Critical Period Hypothesis by examining the positive side of language development: it demonstrates which modules of the grammar are easy to acquire and are not subject to age effects. The Bottleneck Hypothesis is proposed, which argues that inflectional morphology and its features present the most formidable challenge, while syntax and phrasal semantics pose less difficulty to learners. Findings from the neurofunctional imaging (PET, fMRI) and electrophysiology (ERPs) of L 2 comprehension are reviewed and critically examined. Since it is argued that experimental tasks in those studies are mostly in need of linguistic refinement, evidence from behavioral studies of L 2 acquisition of semantics are brought to bear on comprehension modeling. Learning situations are divided into two types: those presenting learners with complex syntax, but simple semantics; and those offering complex semantic mismatches in simple syntactic contexts. The numerous studies of both types reviewed in the book indicate that there is no barrier to ultimate <b>success</b> <b>in</b> the <b>acquisition</b> of phrasal semantics...|$|R
40|$|Foreign {{language}} pedagogy {{has often}} been influenced by findings drawn from the area of first and/or second language acquisition with confusing results. The thesis explores {{the extent to which}} the inter-relation of variables in foreign language learning differs from that <b>in</b> natural <b>acquisition</b> processes and varies across a range of learning contexts, thereby encouraging different pedagogical approaches. Chapter one argues that some models underestimate the different variables involved and suggests that a socio-cultural approach is more effective in identiffing and explaining the shifting relation between context and cognition. Chapter two seeks to situate foreign language study within a more general process of jimctional differentiation' in the child's widening linguistic repertoire, arguing that not only does the relation of context and cognition change between L I and L 2 but also within L 2 itself. Chapter three examines the shifting relation between context and cognition with reference to the language programme of European Schools in general, and the one at Culham in particular. The latter provides a basis for answering two questions: (1) is there a correlation between <b>success</b> <b>in</b> an <b>acquisition</b> poor environment and the extent of the learner's analytic competence; (2) does motivation play an increasing role <b>in</b> affecting <b>success</b> <b>in</b> contexts where goals are long-term rather than immediate? Data collected from the school are analyzed in chapter four. Response to both questions would seem to he positive although the complexity of the learners' backgrounds produced greater variation in the role of affective factors than anticipated. Finally, chapter five argues that the relative success of foreign language study from an early stage in schemes such as the European schools or the immersion programmes depends upon a precise interplay of socio-cognitive variables which is unlikely to he replicated elsewhere...|$|R

These factors are often assumed to have an influence, and serve as a basis for many prejudices against L 2 speakers that are held by potential employers but also by the public.

Based on this assumption, we can observe a rising popularity of foreign-exchange programs in high school and university and a positive discrimination of applicants who claim such a stay in their CV by employers.

However, relative investment in these pre- and post-copulatory traits {{depends on the}} relative importance of either selection episode and on the energetic costs and fitness gains of investing in these traits. Theoretical and empirical work has improved our understanding of how precopulatory sexual traits and investments in sperm production cov- ary in this context. It has recently also been suggested that male weapon size may trade off with sperm length as another post-copulatory sexual trait, but the theoretical framework for this suggestion remains unclear. We eval- uated the relationship between precopulatory armaments and sperm length, previously reported in ungulates, in five taxa as well as meta-analytically. Within and between taxa, we found no evidence for a negative or positive relationship between sperm length and male traits that are important in male–male contest competition. It is important to consider pre- and post- copulatory sexual selection together to understand fitness, and to study investments in different reproductive traits jointly rather than separately. A trade-off between pre- and post-copulatory sexual traits may not manifest itself in sperm length but rather in sperm number or function. Particularly in large-bodied taxa such as ungulates, sperm number is more variable interspecifically and likely to be under more intense selection than sperm length.

A total of 60 students selected from the researcher’s two English classes at Vörösmarty Mihály Primary school in Debrecen participated in the study. The subjects were randomly assigned either to an experimental group that was taught using the ideas based on Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences theory in order to acquire vocabulary or a control group which received traditional teaching methods on vocabulary. At the research period of three weeks, the data were collected through a Multiple Intelligences Profile questionnaire on both the teacher’s and the students’ multiple intelligence strengths and weaknesses, a vocabulary pre-test, an immediate vocabulary post-test and a delayed vocabulary test. The result of the study revealed that students taught through Multiple Intelligences-based methods demonstrated more <b>success</b> <b>in</b> vocabulary <b>acquisition</b> and retention, than those who were exposed to traditional methods.
