It benchmarks Africa's experience with that of the world using an augmented version of the gravity model and applying a comprehensive set of robustness checks. The empirical findings suggest that membership in a currency union should benefit Africa as much as it does the rest of the world. In addition, for both samples, we find evidence that (1) there is a <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> union trade-generating effect; (<b>2)</b> <b>currency</b> unions are associated with trade creation and increased price comovements among member countries; and (3) the duration of currency union membership matters for trade: longer duration brings about greater benefits, and vice versa, however with some diminishing returns. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{episodes of}} current account adjustment in individual economies. A central {{finding is that}} these episodes are very divergent and can be usefully classified, {{on the basis of}} cluster analysis, in three groups. A majority of cases is characterised by internal adjustment, exhibiting slowing domestic demand growth. In some cases, the adjustment was mainly external, facilitated by an exchange rate depreciation but without economic slowdown. Finally, some cases involved a crisis-like combination of a severe slowdown and a <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> depreciation. Using a multinomial logit, we find that this classification of episodes helps improve the predictability of current account adjustment. external imbalances, current account adjustment, cluster analysis, multinomial logit...|$|R

40|$|The {{notions of}} {{inclusion}} and exclusion {{have a long}} tradition in sociology, but have gained <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> more recently in public policy analysis. However, a certain conceptual inflexibility arises when the distinction is applied to complex social situations. This article examines the main approaches to inclusion/exclusion in the sociological tradition, systems theory and the theory of new inequalities. On this basis, five interrelated situations of inclusion and exclusion are constructed: self-inclusion/self-exclusion, inclusion by risk/exclusion by danger, compensatory inclusion, inclusion in exclusion and sub-inclusion. They are illustrated with specific examples to refine an analytical approach to problems of inclusion and exclusion, {{with a view to}} contributing to sociological analysis and to assessing the consequences of public and private decisions...|$|R
50|$|Firstly, {{liability}} dollarization (see Domestic liability dollarization) is {{one main}} reason against floating exchange rate. It {{refers to the}} situations where liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies (usually denominated in US dollar) while assets are in the local currency. Consequently. liability dollarization is also used interchangeably with currency mismatch. Under this currency mismatch, an unexpected depreciation of local currency would deteriorate bank and corporation's balance sheets, and the shrink in asset relative to foreign currency debts would threaten {{the stability of the}} financial system in local country. In countries with <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> mismatches, the balance sheet effect is quite substantial, ignoring the high exchange rate volatility can prove to be very costly. This could provide an argument for sterilized foreign market intervention.|$|R

50|$|Sometimes {{the term}} base {{currency}} may also {{refer to the}} currency of a bank or company; usually their domestic currency. For example, a British bank may use GBP as a base currency for accounting, because all profits and losses are converted to sterling. If a EUR/USD position is closed out with a profit in USD by a British bank, then the rate-to-base will be expressed as a GBP/USD rate.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an investigation}} of the determinants of the international role of a currency. In the standard approach to international currencies, agents assess the desirability of a currency {{on the basis of a}} set of country and currency characteristics that serve as indicators of future transaction costs associated with the <b>currency</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 7 s international use. These characteristics, called standard determinants, are [...] inflation variability, exchange rate variability, inflation rate, exchange rate, financial openness, world export share, depth and breadth of the financial market, and net foreign asset position. The first four determinants relate to monetary performance, and along with financial openness, are summarily referred to as currency stability criteria. ^ A critical evaluation of the standard approach reveals a central weakness relating to the role of currency stability criteria as determinants of international currency status. When agents base future expectations about a <b>currency</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 7 s transaction costs on the available evidence regarding stability, they, in effect, presume that future monetary performance and financial openness will mirror the past performance of the currency. The dissertation argues that such a view is naive, because the issuer 2 ̆ 7 s promise of stability is not exogenously enforceable. That the issuer will not be tempted to renege ex post, that is, deviate from its previous record of stability, cannot be guaranteed ex ante. ^ The dissertation advocates an enforcement approach to international currencies that makes explicit the underlying agency problem. It models the relationship between the key currency issuer and foreign holders of its currency as an endogenously enforceable contract. Endogenous enforcement mechanisms elicit appropriate issuer behavior, and translate into four structural characteristics of the issuer nation, called enforcement determinants [...] stock of foreign direct investment assets abroad, multinational rent earnings from abroad, central bank independence, and military strength. In the enforcement approach to international currencies, agents supplement the standard currency stability criteria with these enforcement determinants, as indicators of a <b>currency</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 7 s future stability prospects. Unlike currency stability criteria, the remaining standard determinants are not subject to surprise changes, so that for them, actual observed record is a reasonable indicator of future trends. ^ The dissertation 2 ̆ 7 s model of the determinants of currency internationalization thus includes the set of standard determinants and the set of enforcement determinants. The model is estimated using time-series cross-sectional analysis for four data sets, and three different measures of international currency share. The econometric investigation indicates that all enforcement determinants are strongly significant and robust in explaining international currency share. Monetary performance related standard determinants fail to exhibit explanatory power, while the performance of the remaining standard determinants can be characterized as mixed. ^ Endogenous enforcement, as a theoretical framework for studying international currencies, and the dissertation 2 ̆ 7 s empirical results in particular, have important implications. They suggest that in the international acceptance and use of national <b>currencies,</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 2 structure 2 ̆ 2 speaks louder than 2 ̆ 2 actions 2 ̆ 2. While popular predictions regarding the future evolution of the U. S. dollar, the deutsche mark, and the yen envision an evolving 2 ̆ 2 tripolar 2 ̆ 2 world, the dissertation underscores convergence of enforcement determinants among the 2 ̆ 2 big three 2 ̆ 2 as crucial to the tripolar outcome. ...|$|R
