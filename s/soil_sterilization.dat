Our ozone reactor has cylindrical shape, a screw electrode is used for an inner side electrode, and ozone was generated by dielectric barrier discharges. This time, we investigated influences on ozone generation characteristics when we used the outer electrode of 3 cm or divided outer electrodes.

Dazomet is used for <b>soil</b> <b>sterilization</b> as an alternative to methyl bromide. Although less effective it is still used to kill pests because of its comparatively lower toxicity. Dazomet is applied to wet soil, which causes dazomet itself to decompose into a gaseous form, which is what actively controls pests. The decomposition of dazomet releases methyl isothiocyanate (MITC) a gas toxic to pests that would prevent or kill plant growth.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Soil</b> steam <b>sterilization</b> (<b>soil</b> steaming) is a farming {{technique}} that sterilizes soil with steam in open fields or greenhouses. Pests of plant cultures such as weeds, bacteria, fungi and viruses are killed through induced hot steam which causes their cell structure to physically degenerate. Biologically, {{the method is}} considered a partial disinfection. Important heat-resistant, spore-forming bacteria survive and revitalize the soil after cooling down. Soil fatigue can be cured through the release of nutritive substances blocked within the soil. Steaming leads to a better starting position, quicker growth and strengthened resistance against plant disease and pests. Today, the application of hot steam is considered {{the best and most}} effective way to disinfect sick soil, potting soil and compost. It is being used as an alternative to bromomethane, whose production and use was curtailed by the Montreal Protocol. [...] "Steam effectively kills pathogens by heating the soil to levels that cause protein coagulation or enzyme inactivation." ...|$|R
50|$|Modern <b>soil</b> steam <b>sterilization</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1888 (by Frank in Germany) and was first commercially {{used in the}} United States (by Rudd) in 1893 (Baker 1962). Since then, {{a wide variety of}} steam machines have been built to disinfest both commercial greenhouse and nursery field soils (Grossman and Liebman 1995). In the 1950s, for example, steam sterilization technologies expanded from disinfestation of potting soil and greenhouse mixes to commercial production of steam rakes and tractor-drawn steam blades for fumigating small acres of cut flowers and other high-value field crops (Langedijk 1959). Today, even more effective steam technologies are being developed.|$|R
50|$|Hoophouses {{have existed}} {{at least since}} the 1940s, but they are much more {{commonly}} used with each passing decade, and their design continues to evolve. Because of the wide variety of constantly changing designs, in reality there is an entirely continuous spectrum from high tunnels through low tunnels to the simplest row covers, although they are often thought about as discrete steps. Major themes of continuing development are (1) achieving the same results with lighter construction and less cost and (2) making hoophouses easily movable. The advantages of mobile hoophouses include greater return on investment (with the same unit of investment getting greater use per year across different crops in different months) and more flexibility on crop rotation without ever having to bother to dig the soil out of a stationary house (or use <b>soil</b> steam <b>sterilization)</b> to cure greenhouse soil sickness.|$|R
5000|$|Most herbs {{prefer a}} well drained, friable soil. This allows the roots {{to receive the}} water they need without the danger of rot and {{promotes}} a strong root system. [...] There {{are a variety of}} soil amendments to be added if the soil in a specific area is not desirable for to promote good herb growth. For outdoor herb farming the soil must be prepared ahead of time by removing vegetation and analyzing soil for pH value and amount of fertilizer needed for proper growing conditions. In commercial industries, additional <b>soil</b> <b>sterilization</b> is used to eliminate common soil derived crop diseases, pests, and for the control of weeds. Additionally, crop rotation is important to diminish the possibility of common crop diseases.|$|E

Although its use was to be phased out completely in the United States by Jan. 1, 2005, due to environmental concerns, a 1 -year critical-use exemption will allow tree fruit growers to use the fumigant {{through the end of}} the year. To explore possible replacements for methyl bromide, we compared the effects of pre- and postplant treatments and amendments on soil microbial communities and tree vigor in a replanted peach orchard. Both <b>soil</b> <b>sterilization</b> treatments and organic carbon amendments changed the composition of microbial communities in the soil. High microbial biomass is generally considered beneficial to agricultural soils; we found that it was usually highest in soils that received the organic carbon amendment and lowest in those with <b>soil</b> <b>sterilization.</b> However, tree vigor was highest with the sterilization treatments.

In a greenhouse study, we investigated whether the sign and strength of feedback changed across two distinct soil types, and whether effects were due to shifts in biotic or abiotic soil traits. Using soils from two different locations, we examined growth of the exotic invasive shrub, Lonicera maackii and the related native shrub, Diervilla lonicera, in unconditioned soils and in soils conditioned by previous growth of L. maackii, D. lonicera, and Fraxinus pennsylvanica. In a sandy acidic soil, L. maackii showed positive feedback in unsterilized soils, but its growth decreased and positive feedback became negative with <b>sterilization</b> in this <b>soil.</b> In a loamy circumneutral soil, L. maackii displayed neutral to negative feedback in unsterilized <b>soils,</b> but <b>sterilization</b> significantly increased growth in all conditioning treatments and caused feedback to become strongly negative. Native D. lonicera displayed negative feedback in unsterilized soil of both the sandy and loamy types, but sterilization either eliminated or reversed feedback relationships. Soil conditioning by L. maackii and F. pennsylvanica had very similar feedbacks on L. maackii and D. lonicera.

50|$|In 1999, an {{estimated}} 71,500 tonnes of synthetic methyl bromide were used annually worldwide. 97% of this estimate {{is used for}} fumigation purposes, whilst 3% {{is used for the}} manufacture of other products. Moreover, 75% of the consumption takes place in developed nations, led by the U.S. (43%) and Europe (24%). Asia and the Middle East combine to use 24% whereas Latin America and Africa have the lowest consumption rates at 9%.Until its production and use was curtailed by the Montreal Protocol, bromomethane was widely applied as a soil sterilant, mainly for production of seed but also for some crops such as strawberries and almonds. In commercial large-scale monoculture seed production, unlike crop production, it is of vital importance to avoid contaminating the crop with off-type seed of the same species. Therefore, selective herbicides cannot be used. Whereas bromomethane is dangerous, it is considerably safer and more effective than some other soil sterilants. Its loss to the seed industry has resulted in changes to cultural practices, with increased reliance on <b>soil</b> steam <b>sterilization,</b> mechanical rogueing, and fallow seasons. Bromomethane was also used as a general-purpose fumigant to kill a variety of pests including rats and insects. Bromomethane has poor fungicidal properties. Bromomethane is the only fumigant allowed (heat treatment is only other option) under ISPM 15 regulations when exporting solid wood packaging (forklift pallets, crates, bracing) to ISPM 15 compliant countries. Bromomethane is used to prepare golf courses, particularly to control Bermuda grass. The Montreal Protocol stipulates that bromomethane use be phased out.|$|R
40|$|Two {{mechanisms}} {{that have been}} proposed to explain success of invasive plants are unusual biotic interactions, such as enemy release or enhanced mutualisms, and increased resource availability. However, while these mechanisms are usually considered separately, both {{may be involved in}} successful invasions. Biotic interactions may be positive or negative and may interact with nutritional resources in determining invasion success. In addition, the effects of different nutrients on invasions may vary. Finally, genetic variation in traits between populations located in introduced versus native ranges may be important for biotic interactions and/or resource use. Here, we investigated the roles of soil biota, resource availability, and plant genetic variation using seedlings of Triadica sebifera in an experiment in the native range (China). We manipulated nitrogen (control or 4 g/m 2), phosphorus (control or 0. 5 g/m 2), soil biota (untreated or sterilized field soil), and plant origin (4 populations from the invasive range, 4 populations from the native range) in a full factorial experiment. Phosphorus addition increased root, stem, and leaf masses. Leaf mass and height growth depended on population origin and <b>soil</b> <b>sterilization.</b> Invasive populations had higher leaf mass and growth rates than native populations did in fresh soil but they had lower, comparable leaf mass and growth rates in sterilized soil.

40|$|Invasive plant species, such as Lonicera maackii, are {{threats to}} the {{ecosystems}} of their invaded ranges. While many plants species are identified as being invasive, {{little is known about}} the mechanisms that allow for their success. An area of specific interest is how a non-native invasive species can interact with a native plant species. Allelopathy is a proposed mechanism by which an invasive plant might directly, or indirectly, suppress a competitor by phytochemical products. Though L. maackii has been described as having allelopathic potential, it remains unclear as to the impact that it has on below ground processes. These processes may include nutrient uptake, mycorrhizal infection, soil microbial activities and response to pathogens. In order to explore the potential below ground effects of L. maackii on a native species, Impatiens capensis, we tested the effects of a rhizosphere extract under two soil conditions and measured mycorrhizal infection, through time, with microscopy. The natural fluorescence of the mycorrhizae allowed us to observe changes in the infection of the roots resulting from treatment with L. maackii rhizosphere extract. Our results found that <b>soil</b> <b>sterilization,</b> and <b>soil</b> <b>sterilization</b> with exposure to L. maackii, affect mycorrhizal infection in I. capensis roots. In addition, we found positive effects of <b>soil</b> <b>sterilization</b> on above ground growth measures. Evaluation of our growth measures and mycorrhizal infection revealed different positive correlations between various growth measures in different treatments, but no significant correlations to mycorrhizal infection.

The {{development of}} an ASD system for Florida incorporated soil solarization with clear plastic (Ginegar Plastic Products, Ltd. Israel) {{with the addition of}} a labile carbon source and flooding to create elevated soil temperatures and anaerobic soil conditions to stimulate microbial activity. In order to increase the water holding capacity of the sandy Florida soil, composted broiler litter (Boyd Brothers Inc., Branford, FL) was also incorporated into the system, as was the utilization of a local carbon source, heavy blackstrap molasses (Westway Feed Products, Inc., Clewiston, FL). Two years of field trials have been conducted in a bell pepper, eggplant double crop using typical Florida raised-bed vegetable production system. Untreated (UTC) and methyl bromide (MeBr) controls were included in both years. Soil temperature, soil moisture, and soil anaerobicity were monitored continuously during the ASD treatment. Inoculum packets were introduced prior to ASD establishment to determine treatment impacts on survival of Phytophthora capsici. Soils were sampled before initialization of the experiment and periodically during the season to determine treatment impacts on soil pH, soil nutrients, soil physical properties, and nematodes. Following ASD treatment, bell peppers (Capsicum annuum) were planted in Sept. 2008 and eggplant (Solanum melongena) in Feb. 2009. Plots were regularly evaluated for treatment impacts on weed control, root galling caused by root-knot nematode, and crop growth and productivity.

40|$|Invasive {{plant species}} {{are one of}} the leading threats to the {{structure}} and function of native ecosystems. Increased attention has been given to the mechanisms that drive successful invasions, including those influencing belowground interactions between invasive and native plant species. To determine how the prominent invasive shrub Lonicera maackii (Rupr.) Herder affects a co-occurring native plant, we examined how a root/rhizosphere extract from L. maackii affected growth and mycorrhizal infection of Impatiens capensis Meerb. using epifluorescence microscopy of live roots. We also examined how the presence of a live soil microbial community influenced growth and mycorrhizal infection of I. capensis and how it the altered the effect of L. maackii extracts on these variables. In live soils, exposure to L. maackii extracts reduced mycorrhizal infection, reduced height, and slightly reduced shoot mass. In sterilized soils, exposure to L. maackii extracts slightly increased mycorrhizal infection, reduced height, and generally increased shoot, root, and total biomass. Soilsterilization substantially reduced mycorrhizal infection but increased growth of plants by 1. 5 – 2 times over plants in corresponding treatments in live soils. The overall effect of the root/rhizosphere extractwas dependent on the presence of a live microbial community in the soil, having generally positive effects on biomass in sterilized soils but negative effects in live soils. Despite strongly reducing mycorrhizal infection, removal of <b>soil</b> microbes by <b>sterilization</b> benefitted plant growth perhaps by removal of pathogenic microbes and/or microbes capable of metabolizing allelochemicals of L. maackii into more toxic forms...|$|R

The treatment effects were statistically evaluated by one-way analysis of variance. Tukey ́s test was used to compare means at p ≤ 0. 05. The presence of different sources of organic residues increased the enzymatic activity in the sampling period. Cattle manure induced the highest enzymatic activity, followed by municipal sewage sludge, whereas earthworm casts induced the lowest activity, but differed from control treatment.

Soils used were infertile acid soils collected from field sites in Pangasinan, Luzon and Surigao, Mindanao. In both soils, the Australian Pisolithus H 445 improved the growth of E. urophylla seedlings more than Philippine isolate H 615. The uninoculated seedlings exhibited stunted growth typical of P deficiency. Height at 8 weeks was significantly taller in sterile than in non-sterile soil. A significant interaction effect of inoculation and <b>soil</b> <b>sterilization</b> on height at harvest was observed only in Surigao soil. <b>Soil</b> <b>sterilization</b> had a varied effect on mycorrhizal formation.
