40|$|The {{growing number}} of biogas plants in Europe has {{resulted}} in increased production of nutrient-rich digestate, which has potential as fertiliser on arable land. Many different organic materials can be degraded in the anaerobic digestion process, with most macronutrients and micronutrients retained in the digestate. Depending on the ingoing organic substrate {{and management of the}} biogas process, the nutrient content of digestate varies widely. It can also contain compounds such as heavy metals and organic pollutants that are potentially toxic to soil microorganisms. Previous studies on the effect of digestate on soil microorganisms and crop yield have yielded contradictory results, so further investigations are needed to determine its true fertiliser value. In this thesis, the fertiliser effect of different types of digestate originating from biogas plants operating with various substrates and operating parameters was determined by measuring: 1) general and specific soil microbial activity, 2) bacterial and archaeal community composition, 3) crop growth and 4) chemical and physical composition of different digestates. Soil respiration generally displayed a positive response to digestate addition, but soil respiration curves revealed differences in quality and quantity of organic carbon between digestate, pig <b>slurry</b> <b>and</b> cow <b>manure.</b> However, the total utilisation rate of the organic carbon in digestate, pig <b>slurry</b> <b>and</b> cow <b>manure</b> did not differ. Moreover, digestate showed both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on potential ammonia oxidation, while pig <b>slurry</b> <b>and</b> cow <b>manure</b> had a more consistent inhibitory effect. Addition of digestate to soil resulted in increased wheat yield compared with control soil and mineral fertiliser, but final yield was not as high as that from pig slurry. Digestate was also generally characterised by a higher content of ammonium and lower content of organic carbon than pig <b>slurry</b> <b>and</b> cow <b>manure.</b> Addition of digestate to soil resulted in changes in the microbial community structure, with less pronounced effect in sandy soils, but no change in diversity was detected. It can be concluded that the digestate from biogas plants has great potential as a fertiliser in crop production and does not seem to pose a greater risk of disturbing soil microorganisms than pig <b>slurry</b> <b>and</b> cow <b>manure</b> when spread on arable land...|$|R

40|$|As {{organic farming}} prohibits {{the use of}} {{synthetic}} fertilisers, animal <b>slurries</b> <b>and</b> <b>manures</b> must be used. Digestate offers an alternative to these and this study reports on three experiments conducted to determine its usability in terms of: (1) the effect on earthworm populations, (2) its fertilising effects on Italian Ryegrass and wild Creeping Thistle, and (3) the suppression effects digestate has on weed emergence. The results for digestate application to field plots were intermediate between <b>slurry</b> <b>and</b> no treatment for earthworm attraction and wild thistle suppression. In glasshouse trials it led to increased ryegrass growth compared with undigested slurry. Analysis showed that the digestate had improved nitrogen availability, leading to increased plant growth, but a reduced organic matter content compared with the slurry, leading to a positive though less beneficial impact on the earthworms. Digestate therefore provides a suitable fertiliser for organic farming. This suitability could be improved by drying or separation to increase the OM content making its properties closer to those of slurry whilst still retaining the higher content of plant available nitrogen...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{number of}} farm-based biogas plants in Austria {{increased}} {{rapidly in the}} recent past, a continuing interest in this technology is expected. A survey {{was carried out in}} 2002 to provide information for farmers and the decision makers involved. In most plants <b>slurry</b> <b>and</b> <b>manure</b> is co-digestion with energy crops and/or organic waste. Wet fermentation in mesophilic digesters with post-digesters combined with separate storage tanks is the main technology used. The trapped biogas is utilized in CHP-units and the electricity is sold to the grid. The waste heat is supplied to the farm and farm house, only a few sell it for district heating. The labour requirement depends on the fermented feedstock. <b>Slurry</b> <b>and</b> <b>manure</b> cause the lowest and the co-digestion of organic waste the highest labour requirement. The survey results indicate a distinct decrease in investment costs per unit. On average 75 % of the capacity of the farm-based biogas plants are used. Most farmers intend to increase production at higher electricity prices. Further reasons to produce more biogas would be the abandonment of livestock husbandry or direct payments for energy crops...|$|E

This study aimed to determine the relative impact of biotic, specifically microbial community structure, and physico-chemical properties associated with soils derived from 12 contrasting land-uses on enteropathogen survival.

The effect of ultrasonication on soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) and biochemical methane potential (BMP) were determined, and the energy efficiency of ultrasonic pretreatment was evaluated. Ultrasonic pretreatment was applied at two amplitudes (80 and 160 µmpp) and at two time settings (15 and 30 s) {{to each of the}} four manure types. The SCOD of each manure sample was determined before and after ultrasonic pretreatment. In addition, BMP trials were run on each waste with and without ultrasonic pretreatment. As part of the BMP, biogas production was measured and analyzed for methane content and cumulative methane production. Ultrasonic pretreatment of swine slurry, beef feedlot <b>manure,</b> dairy <b>manure</b> <b>slurry,</b> <b>and</b> separated dairy <b>manure</b> effluent increased the average SCOD up to 23 %, 92 %, 59 %, and 33 %, respectively, and the average methane yield up to 56 %, 43 %, 62 %, and 20 %, respectively.

Surface and sub-surface nutrient flow pathways were monitored, by sampling water from the saturated and unsaturated zones of the soil profile, and from surface runoff. Sub-surface flow was dominated by N 03 [...] N. However, concentrations of this N species were relatively low (3 - 6 mg 1 - 1), and differences between treatments and the control were not significant.

40|$|The use of {{lignocellulosic}} biomass {{as a substrate}} {{in agricultural}} biogas plants is very popular and yields good results. However, the efficiency of anaerobic digestion, and thus biogas production, is not always satisfactory due to the slow or incomplete degradation (hydrolysis) of plant matter. To enhance the solubilization of the lignocellulosic biomass various physical, chemical and biological pretreatment methods are used. The {{aim of this study}} was to select and characterize cellulose-degrading bacteria, and to construct a microbial consortium, dedicated for degradation of maize silage and enhancing biogas production from this substrate. Over one hundred strains of cellulose-degrading bacteria were isolated from: sewage sludge, hydrolyzer from an agricultural biogas plant, cattle <b>slurry</b> <b>and</b> <b>manure.</b> After physiological characterization of the isolates, sixteen strains (representatives of Bacillus, Providencia and Ochrobactrum genera) were chosen for the construction of a Microbial Consortium with High Cellulolytic Activity, called MCHCA.

Lab-scale simulation of biogas production using the selected strains for degradation of maize silage was carried out in a two-bioreactor system, similar to those used in agricultural biogas plants. The obtained results showed that the constructed MCHCA consortium is capable of efficient hydrolysis of maize silage, and increases biogas production by even 38 %, depending on the inoculum used for methane fermentation.

Whilst the behaviour of other classes of substance (e. g. pesticides and nutrients) that are applied to soil is well understood, limited information {{is available on the}} transport and fate of veterinary medicines applied to soils. Laboratory and field studies were, therefore, performed to investigate the sorption behaviour of the sulfonamide antibiotic, sulfachloropyridazine, in soil and to assess the potential for sulfachloropyridazine to move from soil to surface waters and groundwaters. Sorption coefficients (KD) for the compound in soil and soil/slurry mixtures were low (ranging from 0. 9 to 1. 8 l kg− 1) and indicated that the substance would be highly mobile. Field studies on a clay field supported these observations and demonstrated that, after application, the compound was rapidly transported to surface waters, concentrations of up to 590 μg l− 1 being observed in drainage waters. Leaching studies at a sandy site indicated that the substance had a low potential to leach to groundwaters, concentrations in the soil pore water being below or close to analytical detection limits. An assessment of currently available models for predicting concentrations of veterinary medicines entering surface waters indicated that for sulfachloropyridazine, the methods provide reasonable estimates, predicted concentrations being within a factor of two of the maximum measured concentrations.

Some of the pathogenic microorganisms applied to soil have been observed to leach through the soil into groundwater, which poses a risk to public health. There is a critical need, therefore, for characterization of pathogen movement through the vadose zone for assessment of the risk to groundwater quality due to agricultural activities. A lysimeter experiment was performed to investigate the effect of soil type and condition on the fate and transport of potential bacterial pathogens, using Escherichia coli as a marker, in four Irish soils (n = 9). Cattle slurry (34 tonnes per ha) was spread on intact soil monoliths (depth, 1 m; diameter, 0. 6 m) in the spring and summer.

E. coli was found to have persisted in control soils for more than 9 years, indicating that autochthonous E. coli populations are capable of becoming naturalized in the low-temperature environments of temperate maritime soils and that they can move through soil.

This paper presents a review of studies of NH 3 emission from field-applied animal <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> of the methods available for its reduction. It is shown that there is a complex relationship between the NH 3 emission rate from <b>slurry</b> <b>and</b> the <b>slurry</b> composition, soil conditions and climate. It is concluded that simple empirical models cannot be used to predict ammonia emission from the wide range of circumstances found in European agriculture and that a more mechanistic approach is required. NH 3 emission from applied solid <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> poultry <b>manure</b> has been studied less intensively than slurry but appear to be controlled by similar mechanisms. The use of trail hoses, pre- or post-application cultivation, reduction in slurry viscosity, choice of application rate <b>and</b> timing <b>and</b> <b>slurry</b> injection were considered as reduction techniques. The most effective methods of reducing ammonia emissions were concluded to be incorporation of the animal <b>slurry</b> <b>and</b> farmyard <b>manure</b> or <b>slurry</b> injection.

40|$|Purpose This {{contribution}} investigates {{agricultural soils}} and sedimentary deposits {{in the province}} of Ferrara (Padanian alluvial plain, Northern Italy) in order to: examine their genesis; to define the geochemical background of the area; and to evaluate the existence of anthropogenic contamination. Moreover, environmental risk related to the presence of potentially toxic heavy metals that can be transferred into agricultural products (and consequently bio-accumulated in the food chain) was also assessed. Materials and methods The analyses (reported in an extensive supplementary dataset) include XRD, XRF and ICP-MS assessment of bulk sediments, tests of metal extraction with aqua regia, as well as analyses of local agricultural products, i. e. biomonitoring which is important in the evaluation of element mobility. Results and discussion Based on the results, GIS-based geochemical maps were produced and local background levels were defined. This approach demonstrated that high concentrations of Cr and Ni is a natural (geogenic) feature of the local alluvial terrains, which in turn is related to the origin and provenance of the sediments, as confirmed by the lack of top enrichment in all of the investigated sites. Tests of metal extraction and analyses of agricultural products provide guidelines for agricultural activities, suggesting that extensive use of sewage sludge, industrial <b>slurry</b> <b>and</b> <b>manure</b> (that are often rich in metals) should be minimised. Conclusions The dataset reported in this paper shows that the agricultural terrains of the studied alluvial plain are not characterised by anthropogenic heavy metal pollution. In spite of the elevated natural background of Cr and Ni, most of the local agricultural products do not show significant evidence of bio-magnification. Exceptions are represented by forage grass (alfalfa) and corn (maize) that tend to uptake As and Ni, respectively. This demonstrates that in agricultural areas, a geochemical risk assessment must include both soil and plant investigations...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{aggregate}} {{formation is}} an important process for long-term carbon storage in soils. While {{it has been shown}} that plant residues exert a positive influence on aggregate formation, the effects of organic fertilizers such as cattle slurry or manure as well as the effects of biochar application to soil are less clear. Furthermore, little is known about the role of increased soil temperatures in aggregate dynamics. The main objectives of this thesis were to analyse the effects of (i) cattle <b>slurry</b> <b>and</b> <b>manure,</b> (ii) the application of biochar and (iii) different temperature regimes on soil aggregate and carbon dynamics. For this, two incubation experiments and one field trial were analysed. In the laboratory experiments soil without macro-aggregates was incubated at different temperatures with biochar, slurry, manure or different mixtures of biochar and slurry. In the sampled field trial the factors increased soil temperatures and biochar application were analysed. The results show no or negative effects of biochar application on soil aggregate formation, while slurry was found to have positive effects. The combined application of biochar and slurry led to lower aggregate yields than the solitary application of slurry. However, interactions between biochar and mineral soil particles were already found shortly after the application in both the incubations and in the field trial, leading to an increase of aggregate-occluded and thus protected soil organic carbon, especially in combination with a slurry application. Increased temperatures in steps of 10 °C led to an increased aggregate formation in the incubation experiments, presumably due to a metabolization of aggregate binding agents. In the field, however, a temperature increase of 2. 5 °C did not show any effects on soil aggregate or carbon dynamics.

40|$|The large {{quantities}} of <b>slurry</b> <b>and</b> <b>manure</b> that are produced annually in many areas in which cattle are raised could be {{an important source of}} organic matter and nutrients for agriculture. However, the benefits of waste recycling may be partially offset by the risk of water pollution associated with runoff from the fields to which slurry or manure has been applied. In this paper, the effects of cattle manure application on soil erosion rates and runoff and on surface water pollution by faecal coliforms are analysed. Rainfall simulations at a rate of 70 mm h− 1 were conducted in a sandy loam soil packed into soil flumes (2. 5 m long× 1 m wide) at a bulk density of 1400 kg m− 3, with and without cattle slurry manure applied on the surface. For each simulation, sediment and runoff rates were analysed and in those simulations with applied slurry, presumptive faecal coliform (PFC) concentrations in the runoff were evaluated. The application of slurry on the soil surface appeared to have a protective effect on the soils, reducing soil detachment by up to 70 % but increasing runoff volume by up to 30 %. This practice implies an important source of pollution for surface waters especially if rainfall takes place within a short period after application. The concentrations of micro-organisms (presumptive faecal coliforms (PFCs)) found in water runoff ranged from 1. 9 × 104 to 1. 1 × 106 PFC 100 mL− 1, depending on the initial concentration in the slurry, and they were particularly high during the first phases of the rainfall event.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of two slurry manure {{application}} methods, broadcasting <b>manure</b> <b>slurry</b> (MB) <b>and</b> <b>manure</b> slit injection (SMI), on soil faunal communities 1 week and 4 or 5 weeks after application {{in the spring of}} 2002 and the summer of 2003. No effect on total numbers of Enchytraeidae and nematodes was found. Enrichment opportunistic nematodes (CP 1) significantly decreased in the MB treatment, resulting in a significantly higher Maturity Index. In the SMI treatment the Maturity Index was unchanged. Effects of manure application methods on earthworms depended on soil moisture and season. Under wet conditions abundance of earthworms, especially epigeic earthworms, decreased significantly in the MB treatment. In the summer of 2003 total earthworm numbers, and the fraction of epigeics, decreased after SMI. Due to the drought in this period, abundances of epigeic earthworms were already low and possible significant effects of the different manure application methods were therefore hard to interpret...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Successive {{applications}} of pig <b>slurry</b> <b>and</b> poultry <b>manure</b> {{can improve the}} soil structure, according to the land use conditions and amounts applied. This study evaluated the effect of manure fertilization on the physical properties and organic carbon of a Rhodic Kandiudox. Treatments included land use and management and time of pig <b>slurry</b> <b>and</b> poultry litter application, namely: native forest (NF); yerba mate after 20 years of animal waste application (YM 20); pasture after 15 years of application (P 15); grassland after 20 years of manuring (PP 20); grassland after 3 years of manuring (P 3); pasture without application (P 0), maize after 20 years of application (M 20); and maize after 7 years of application (M 7). Soil samples were collected in the 0 - 5, 5 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm layers, in which density, porosity, aggregate stability, flocculation, penetration resistance, available water, and total clay content, total and particulate organic carbon, and C:N ratio were analyzed. The total organic carbon is sensitive to management and {{was not related to}} waste application, except in the 10 - 20 cm layer of ryegrass pasture after three years of manuring. Reponses to waste application and land use and management systems were observed in the variables soil density and penetration resistance...|$|R
40|$|Farm, cattle {{group and}} {{individual}} bovine {{risk factors for}} bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle herds in the South West of England were explored. A cohort study using 148 well characterised cattle herds was conducted in SW England 2001 - 2004. The study {{was set up in}} areas affected by foot-and-mouth disease in 2001 and all farms were taking part in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT). The use of a standard questionnaire and national data records from the skin intradermal cervical comparative tuberculin test (SICCT) and from the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) databases were combined. The two main statistical techniques used were survival analysis and multilevel logistic regression with random effects. Associations with the risk of herd breakdown with bTB were explored using survival analysis. The main factors associated with disclosure of reactor cattle were the purchase of cattle from markets and the storage of <b>slurry</b> <b>and</b> <b>manure</b> in close containment. In the investigation of the risk of an individual bovine animal becoming a reactor using multilevel logistic regression with random effects analysis, explanatory variables at herd, individual cattle and test levels, were explored. The potential exposure to reactor cattle in previous tests was the most significant finding as a risk for a bovine animal reacting at a current test. Only 9 / 19, 027 cattle became reactors if they had not been exposed to a reactor animal previously. When the risk of an animal group having at least one reactor disclosed in the group was investigated using the location of the animal groups within the farm by monthly periods, the risk increased with the number of cattle in the groups when these were housed and with the presence of badgers in the fields when they were grazing. This thesis has provided a deep investigation into the risk factors that can affect the introduction and persistence of infection with M. bovis in cattle herds, and the importance that cattle play in these factors has been highlighted.

ISO 14289 - 1 The aim of {{this study}} was to provide {{recommendations}} on: - Strategies and policy instruments to achieve cost effective abatement of reactive nitrogen from agriculture in the Nordic countries. - The need for further work to describe the effects of integrated, cost effective control strategies for reduction of loss of reactive nitrogen in the Nordic countries under varying climate and soil conditions. This report is based on a literature review performed by Sofie Hellsten, Tommy Dalgaard, Katri Rankinen and Kjetil Tørseth (see Appendix 3). Additional input was also obtained from discussions at a workshop held in Gothenburg in January 2017, with 11 participants from the Nordic countries with different backgrounds within the field of nitrogen and agriculture (See Appendix 1). The current study has contributed to encourage Nordic collaboration regarding nitrogen and agriculture. Main conclusions and recommendations The Nordic countries have, during the last 20 years, introduced efficient measures to reduce nitrogen loss to the environment. Still, N losses are relatively high as compared to the policy targets set, despite the regulatory framework applicable to the agricultural sector at EU and national level. The Nordic countries are at very different stages with regard to nitrogen abatement. Denmark for instance has already cut nitrogen losses by 50 %. Especially, adequate policies and regulations for manure management are important to reduce the impact of reactive nitrogen (ammonia, nitrate and nitrous oxide) from farming systems in the Nordic countries. What further research can be recommended, and what is the way forward for policy development: Stricter laws and regulations, economic instrument and incentives, or more voluntary and advisory efforts? Furthermore, it is important to discuss how to separate and consider the emissions and uncertainties due to weather events and other factors which cannot be controlled by farmers. We have identified a few key policy actions: - The focus in the Nordic countries should be on implementing the most cost effective, practical and feasible measures first. As long as these practical and feasible measures (which do not cause other negative environmental effects) are not fully implemented, more demanding and costly approaches should not be the first priority. - For reduction of ammonia emissions from agriculture, we noted that low nitrogen feed, covered <b>slurry</b> <b>and</b> <b>manure</b> storages and low ammonia emission spreading techniques, are among the most cost-effective, practical and feasible abatement measures to implement. - In some cases, it may be relevant to extend current rules and regulation e. g. regarding new livestock houses, and coverage of manure tanks and spreading of manure, slurry and digested manure. However, the effects (economic and on other pollutants and environmental effects) need to be considered and further investigated. - We recommend that some of the current farm-regulations are simplified. - We recommend scientifically based voluntary actions, in line with the Swedish advisory program “Focus on nutrients” to be continued and further developed, and that similar approaches are also implemented in other Nordic countries. - Important success criteria for advisory actions and changed farming behaviour are voluntary measures and repeated farm visits, relating to how measures will influence farm economy (positively or negatively) and feedback to farmers regarding the environmental progress (e. g. through the press) to make the farmers proud of their achievements. - We also recommend more, scientifically based information campaigns about the effects of changed consumption behaviour, towards reduced nitrogen and greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting the environmental benefits. - We believe N balances, and the distribution of surplus N to different types of losses, may be more relevant as a basis for policy instrument on large (landscape and regional) scales rather than on a small (field) scale. We have identified a few key policy challenges: - A great challenge with agri-environmental policies is to decrease negative effects, while at the same time maintain or increase food production. - When assessing technical abatement measures, a holistic policy approach, not only considering the direct mitigating effect and costs but also other benefits and effects of the actual measure, is important. - In addition to technical measures, system change measures, e. g. reduction of food waste, increasing the overall efficiency in the food chain, or promotion of consumption patterns with lower nitrogen footprints, could help to further reduce overall nitrogen losses. - An important policy challenge is to consider the effect of emissions produced in other countries due to increased import. Measures to reduce nutrient losses from agriculture are ineffective in a global perspective if the production is carried out in other countries with as large or larger environmental effects. - An important dilemma that needs to be discussed politically is the question of carbon sequestration and the fact that digestion of manure to produce biogas may have negative implications and lead to lower C content in soils if the digest is not returned into the soils as fertiliser. Holistic approaches are needed for the use of bio-based energy sources to reduce the use of fossil fuels and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. - We need to produce more with less in the future. Precise farming with modern technology should be highlighted. In this way higher yields with lower nitrogen losses, and net greenhouse gas emissions etc. can be obtained. We have identified a few key knowledge gaps where further research is needed: - From a policy perspective, to further motivate abatement of nitrogen losses from agriculture, it is important to identify knowledge gaps as well as possible overlaps and gaps in existing policies on reactive nitrogen. - The complex interactions, synergies and trade-offs between different pollutants and environmental effects demand relevant assessment tools and more research to find the right balance between potential conflicting interests, including e. g. emission savings, other environmental effects, costs, and ethical values. - There is a need to improve the understanding of the efficiency of voluntary efforts and advisory actions. - Nordic research groups are in a strong position to take on research in novel approaches to mitigate ammonia, nitous oxides and nitrate losses from agricultural land, while developing a significant and more sustainable bioeconomy. - An evaluation of the balance between targeting of mitigation measures and the transaction costs is lacking. - There is a gap to define, evaluate and compare e. g. biodiversity versus water protection effects, mitigation measures for climate change versus water protection targets, etc. - There are large potentials for the development of the Nordic agriculture-based bioeconomy including integration of environmental protection schemes and a better utilisation of nitrogen in the whole production chain. - The back up from the scientific community within the field of nitrogen research is an important contributor to the prominent position of the Nordic countries in different policy bodies within the EU as well as within the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP). Therefore, it is important to continue to exchange information and experience between the Nordic countries on measures and policy strategies to reduce nitrogen losses from agriculture...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate P accumulation and the pollution potential of a soil after application of pig litter. In March 2010, eight years after the installation of an experiment in Braço do Norte, Santa Catarina, SC, Brazil, on a Typic Hapludult, soil was sampled (layers 0 - 2. 5, 2. 5 - 5, 5 - 10, 10 - 15, 15 - 20 and 20 - 30 cm) after the following fertilization treatments: no pig litter fertilization, pig <b>slurry</b> application <b>and</b> pig <b>manure</b> application. In this period, 694 and 1, 890 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1 were applied in the treatments with pig <b>slurry</b> <b>and</b> pig <b>manure,</b> respectively. The P content was determined, based on Mehlich- 1, anion exchange resin (AER), 0. 01 mol L- 1 CaCl 2 and total P in the samples. The adsorption isotherm parameters were also determined by the Langmuir and Koski-Vähälä & Hartikainem models in the layers 0 - 2. 5 and 20 - 30 cm. The application of 1, 890 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1 in the form of pig manure led to P accumulation, as evidenced by Mehlich- 1, down to a depth of 15 cm, by AER and 0. 01 mol L- 1 CaCl 2 down to 20 cm and by total P to 30 cm. After application of 1, 890 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1 in the form of pig manure, the values of maximum P adsorption capacity were lowest in the deepest layer (20 - 30 cm), indicating the occupation of part of the adsorption sites of the particles. The application of swine manure to the soil over eight years increased the P quantity in the soil solution of the surface layer, indicating environmental contamination risk for surface and subsurface waters...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test the response of Napier-bajra hybrid grass that was subjected to treatment with 3 different types of organic <b>manures</b> <b>and</b> 3 different levels of inorganic nitrogen (20 kgN/acre, 40 kgN/acre and 60 kgN/acre) as fertilizer. Organic manure (farm yard <b>manure,</b> bio digested <b>slurry</b> <b>and</b> poultry <b>manure)</b> @ 4 tons/acre as basal manure increased the fodder biomass in a dose-dependent manner when used in combination with a nitrogen-containing fertilizer. We estimated biomass yield in terms of fresh matter yield and dry matter yield. We estimated the nutrient content in terms of percentages of crude protein and crude fibre in the grass that was subjected to different treatments. Our results show that biomass yield was significantly higher when organic manures were used in combination with maximum level (60 kg/acre) of inorganic nitrogen application. The crude protein content was comparable between the 3 types of organic <b>manures</b> <b>and</b> increased in a dose dependent manner to the level of inorganic nitrogen used. The crude fibre content was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher when poultry manure was used as organic <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> was not influenced by the level of inorganic nitrogen application. There {{was no significant difference in}} the palatability of grass fed to the sheep. The cost of production of the grass decreased at higher levels of nitrogen application.

Fecal indicator (Escherichia coli, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens and coliphage) loads released in rainfall runoff from plots treated with fresh cattle manure, aged cattle <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> swine <b>slurry</b> treatments ranged from 5. 52 x 105 to 4. 36 x 109, 3. 92 x 104 to 4. 86 x 108, and 9. 63 x 105 to 3. 05 x 108, respectively. Plot runoff concentrations of protozoa (Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts) ranged from 1. 65 x 105 to 1. 04 x 106, 2. 93 x 103 to 2. 75 x 105, and 9. 12 x 104 to 3. 58 x 106 for fresh cattle manure, aged cattle <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> swine <b>slurry</b> plot treatments, respectively. These results suggest that large microbial loads could be released via heavy precipitation events that produce runoff from livestock manure-applied agricultural fields, of even modest size, and could {{have a significant impact}} on water bodies within the watershed.

40|$|International audienceIn natural river systems, the {{chemical}} and isotopic composition of stream- and ground waters are mainly controlled by the geology and water­rock interactions. The leaching of major cations from soils has been recognized as a possible consequence of acidic deposition from atmosphere for over 30 years. Moreover, in agricultural areas, the application of physiological acid fertilizers and nitrogen fertilizers in the ammonia form may enhance the cation leaching through the soil profile into groundand surface waters. This origin of leached cations has been studied on two small and adjacent agricultural catchments in Brittany, western France. The study catchments are drained by two first-order streams, and mainly covered with cambisoils, issued from the alteration and weathering of a granodiorite basement. Precipitations, soil water- and NH 4 acetate-leachates, separated minerals, and stream waters have been investigated. Chemical element ratios, such as Ba/Sr, Na/Sr and Ca/Sr ratios, as well as Sr isotopic ratios are used to constrain the relative contribution from potential sources of stream water elements. Based on Sr isotopic ratio and element concentration, soil water- and NH 4 acetate leaching indicates (1) a dominant manure/slurry contribution in the top soil, representing a cation concentrated pool, with low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios; (2) in subsoils, mineraldissolution is enhanced by fertilizer application, becoming the unique source of cations in the saprolite. The relatively high weathering rates encountered implies significant sources of cations which are not accessory minerals, but rather plagioclase and biotite dissolution. Stream water has a very different isotopic and chemical composition compared to soil water leaching suggesting that stream water chemistry is dominated by elements issued from mineral and rock weathering. Agriculture, by applications of chemical and organic fertilizers, can influence the export of major base cations, such as Na+. Plagioclase dissolution, rather than anthropogenically controlled soil water, {{seems to be the}} dominant source of Na+ in streams. However, Ca 2 + in streams is mostly derived from <b>slurries</b> <b>and</b> <b>manures</b> deposited on top soils, and transferred into the soil ion-exchange pool and stream waters. Less than 10 % of Na+, 5 ­ 40 % of Sr 2 + and 20 ­ 100 % of Ca 2 + found in streams can be directly derived from the application of organic fertilizers...|$|R
