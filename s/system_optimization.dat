25|$|The {{basics of}} {{continuous}} backpropagation were derived {{in the context}} of control theory by Kelley in 1960 and by Bryson in 1961, using principles of dynamic programming. In 1962, Dreyfus published a simpler derivation based only on the chain rule. Bryson and Ho described it as a multi-stage dynamic <b>system</b> <b>optimization</b> method in 1969. In 1970, Linnainmaa finally published the general method for automatic differentiation (AD) of discrete connected networks of nested differentiable functions. This corresponds to the modern version of backpropagation which is efficient even when the networks are sparse. In 1973, Dreyfus used backpropagation to adapt parameters of controllers in proportion to error gradients. In 1974, Werbos mentioned the possibility of applying this principle to ANNs, and in 1982, he applied Linnainmaa's AD method to neural networks in the way that is widely used today. In 1986, Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams noted that this method can generate useful internal representations of incoming data in hidden layers of neural networks. In 1993, Wan was the first to win an international pattern recognition contest through backpropagation.|$|E

The project was at first intended to be a lean consulting startup and then pivoted to The <b>Systems</b> <b>Optimization</b> Club. A project charter, Gantt chart, and business model canvas were created for the startup and used as guidelines in the creation of the <b>Systems</b> <b>Optimization</b> club. The club is to be run like a lean consulting company. The club will provide teams of students for local SMEs to optimize their systems utilizing industrial engineering tools and methods, and those applicable from other majors, and in return students will receive industry experience and expand their professional network. The club worked with two manufacturers for projects, Hydrogen Junkie and Zodiac Aerospaceâ€™s cabin Interiors division. Standard Times, spaghetti diagrams, and a facilities layout were created for Hydrogen Junkie. At Zodiac Aerospace, twenty two <b>Systems</b> <b>Optimization</b> Club members were split into 7 teams and worked on projects concerning standard times, ergonomics, 5 S, workstation redesign, and value stream mapping. These projects will continue through the end of the year and into Fall 2015...|$|R
