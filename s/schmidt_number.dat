40|$|URL] audienceIn this work, an {{efficient}} way to predict the dynamics of a scalar at high <b>Schmidt</b> <b>numbers,</b> advected by a turbulent flow, is presented. For high <b>Schmidt</b> <b>numbers,</b> the spatial resolution required for the scalar field has to be finer than the resolution required for the velocity field, leading to a significant computational cost due to the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) constraint. We propose here a remeshed particle method coupled to a spectral flow solver to overcome this computational cost limitation. This allows us to perform a systematic analysis of flows over a wide range of Reynolds and <b>Schmidt</b> <b>numbers.</b> For high enough Reynolds and <b>Schmidt</b> <b>numbers,</b> the results presented here recover the spectral behavior predicted by theory. First, the classic k− 5 / 3 law (where k is the wave number) is found for the inertial-convective range. At intermediate scales, the viscous-convective range exhibits a k− 1 law for <b>Schmidt</b> <b>numbers</b> higher than unity. Finally, the numerical results indicate that the dissipation range agree well with the Kraichnan model for high <b>Schmidt</b> <b>numbers...</b>|$|R
