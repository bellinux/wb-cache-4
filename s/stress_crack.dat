40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>stress</b> <b>crack</b> {{resistance}} of some geosynthetics, {{such as high}} density polyethylene geomembranes which are made from semi-crystalline polymers, must be properly evaluated to justify their long term performance. The newly adopted ASTM D 5397 notched constant tensile load test {{can be used to}} make a proper assessment of <b>stress</b> <b>crack</b> resistance. From the results of a notched constant tensile load test, a mini-mum time to reach the beginning of the brittle portion of the response curve can be es-tablished. Unfortunately, the test takes too long to generate the required data (on the order of weeks or months) for it to be considered as a quality control or conformance test. This paper presents a single point version of the notched constant tensile load test, called the single point-notched constant tensile load test. If the appropriate stress level, testing temperature and incubation medium are selected a much shorter testing time of approximately 24 hours can be achieved. Thus, the test can be used as a quality control...|$|E

The two examined fine grain structural steels, 22 NiMoCr 3 7 and 20 MnMoNi 5 5 only show sensitivity to strain-induced <b>stress</b> <b>crack</b> corrosion for the combined effect of the following factors: Sulphur content of the steel > 0. 003 % by weight, plastic deformation > 5 %, corresponding 95 % Rm mechanical load, water temperature > 120 C, oxygen content > 10 ppb, rate of expansion within a critical area. One suspects that at constant load, no <b>stress</b> <b>crack</b> corrosion crack initiation occurs at MnS inclusions near the surface.

40|$|The <b>stress</b> {{corrosion}} <b>crack</b> {{is one of}} {{the fracture}} phenomena for the major structure components in nuclear power plant.

This research has been concerned with investigating <b>stress</b> <b>cracking</b> phenomena which occur when thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU's) are immersed in seawater at low temperatures. The investigation was concerned with testing the following hypothesis: a) that cracking of TPU was due to environmental <b>stress</b> <b>cracking</b> (ESC) and/or b) due to structure and morphology changes which occur during the ageing period. The combined effects of polyurethane chemical backbone, domain structure and crystallinity on <b>stress</b> <b>cracking</b> in TPU were studied. Further, the investigation concerned itself with studying, on <b>stress</b> <b>cracking,</b> the effects of storage conditioning the TPU granules prior to processing, the processing conditions and various postcuring treatments of TPU. Characterisation and analytical techniques employed to study the structure of TPU's investigated consisted of thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction. Molecular weight distribution was studied by gel permeation chromatography and solution viscosity techniques. Processing'was evaluated by melt flow index (MFI), injection moulding and extrusion. A new accelerated ageing test for environmental <b>stress</b> <b>cracking</b> has been developed which uses high pressures. Also, {{a new type of}} ESC chemical class of reagent which relates the hydrogen bonding parameter of the ESC agent to that of the TPU's has been discovered and a theory developed. A test method has been designed to measure, in active environments, the existence of a critical strain for all the TPU examined whether commercial or laboratory synthesised materials. Results show that the <b>stress</b> <b>cracking</b> in TPU's is due to the following events: (a) a large reduction in molecular weight due to the processing, and (b) the combined effects of applied stresses and the hydrolysis of the polymer. Molecular weight reduction in TPU's and their resistance to ESe was also found dependent on the preconditioning history of unprocessed TPU granules, as well as any postcuring operations applied to the processed materials. It has been established that, the ESe resistance of TPU's can be improved by (i) optimising processing conditions, (ii) by insertion of slight crosslinking or by selecting certain types of diisocyanates, specifically p phenylene diisocyanate, and trans 1, 4 -cyclohexane diisocyanate.
