5000|$|At common law, a {{mortgage}} was a conveyance of the property, with a condition subsequent, {{that if the}} grantor paid the <b>secured</b> <b>indebtedness</b> to the grantee on or before a date certain (the [...] "law" [...] day) then the conveyance would be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect. As was inevitable, debtors {{would be unable to}} pay on the law day, and if they tendered the debt after the time had passed, the creditor owed no duty to give the land back. So then the debtor would run to the court of equity, plead that there was an unconscionable forfeiture about to occur, and beg the court to grant an equitable decree requiring the lender to surrender the property upon payment of the secured debt with interest to date. And the equity courts granted these petitions quite regularly and often without regard for {{the amount of time that}} had lapsed since the law day had passed. The lender could interpose a defense of laches, saying that so much time had gone by (and so much improvement and betterment had taken place) that it would be inequitable to require undoing the finality of the mortgage conveyance. Other defenses, including equitable estoppel, were used to bar redemption as well.|$|E

40|$|The formal requirements, under Swiss law, are {{substantially}} higher {{in case of}} Bürgschaft (CO 492 ss) than of Garantie (CO 111), both being contracts <b>securing</b> a thirdparty's <b>indebtedness.</b> The difference {{is that in the}} first case, being more protected, the guarantor has no interest of his own, contrary to the second one. lf the intention of the parties is that the security is valid independently from the validity of the debt secured, we always have a case of Garantie...|$|R
50|$|After World War II, IRI {{became one}} of the largest state {{conglomerates}} in the world, owning many diverse businesses such as the autostrada system, the flag carrier Alitalia and many banks, steel, food, chemicals and telecom companies. It was divested and privatized during the 1980s and 1990s and eventually dissolved in 2002. The Andreatta-Van Miert agreement marked a significant acceleration of privatization, which started in 1992. Despite some opinions to the contrary, the Treasury chose not to privatize the IRI, but to sell off its operating companies; this policy was inaugurated under the first government of Giuliano Amato and was never called into question by later governments. In 1997 it reached the levels of <b>indebtedness</b> <b>secured</b> by the Andreatta-Van Miert agreement, but divestitures continued and the institute had lost any function but to sell its assets and to move towards settlement.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mechanics}} of the qualified residence interest deduction are given in §163(h)(3) of the IRC. In order to use the deduction, the taxpayer must have paid or accrued interest during the taxable year from one {{of two of the}} following sources. The interest must be attributable to either 1) acquisition indebtedness, or 2) home equity indebtedness, with respect to any qualified residence of the taxpayer. [...] Acquisition indebtedness is defined as an indebtedness which is incurred in acquiring, constructing, or substantially improving any qualified residence, and is secured by such residence. [...] Home equity indebtedness is defined as any <b>indebtedness</b> <b>secured</b> by a qualified residence {{to the extent that the}} aggregate amount does not exceed 1) the fair market value of that qualified residence, minus 2) the amount of acquisition indebtedness with respect to that residence.|$|R
5000|$|On November 16, 2011, the Michigan Supreme Court, {{understanding}} the urgency and potential fallout of this matter, issued a peremptory order, {{in lieu of}} granting the appeal, and reversed the Court of Appeals judgment. (Residential Funding Co, LLC v Saurman, 2011 WL 5588929 (Mich, November 1, 2011). The court agreed with the dissenting Court of Appeals opinion, [...] "pursuant to MCL 600.3204(1)(d), Mortgage Electronic Registration System (MERS) is the 'owner [...] [...] [...] of {{an interest in the}} <b>indebtedness</b> <b>secured</b> by the mortgage at issue in each of these consolidated cases' because 'MERS contractual obligations as the mortgagee were dependent upon whether the mortgagor met the obligation to pay the indebtedness which the mortgage secured.'" [...] The Court clarified that [...] "MERS status as an 'owner of an interest in the indebtedness' does not equate to an ownership interest in the note. Rather, as a record-holder of the mortgage, MERS owned a security lien on the property, the continued existence of which was contingent upon the satisfaction of the indebtedness." [...] This interest in the indebtedness [...] [...] [...] authorized MERS to foreclosure by advertisement under MCL 600.3204(1)(d)." [...] (emphasis added). [...] The court's interpreted MCL 600.3204(1) as inclusive rather than exclusive. The court held those with an [...] "interest in the indebtedness" [...] includes mortgagees of record (such as MERS) and constitutes a category of parties entitled to foreclose by advertisement, along with those who [...] "own the indebtedness" [...] and those who [...] "act as the servicing agent of the mortgage." ...|$|R
