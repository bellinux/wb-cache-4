5|$|The Eurasian tree <b>sparrow</b> (Passer montanus) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} <b>sparrow</b> {{family with}} a rich chestnut crown and nape, and a black patch on each pure white cheek. The sexes are similarly plumaged, and young birds are a duller version of the adult. This <b>sparrow</b> breeds over most of temperate Eurasia and Southeast Asia, where it {{is known as the}} tree <b>sparrow,</b> and it has been introduced elsewhere including the United States, where it is known as the Eurasian tree <b>sparrow</b> or German <b>sparrow</b> to differentiate it from the native unrelated American tree <b>sparrow.</b> Although several subspecies are recognised, the appearance of this bird varies little across its extensive range.|$|E

Turner locates <b>Sparrow</b> and his crew on Pelegosto, held captive by cannibals who intend to eat <b>Sparrow.</b> They escape, and voyage to Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) (a magical woman later revealed to be the Goddess, Calypso, bound in human form as Dalma, and former lover of Jones). Dalma immediately sees destiny in Will, and provides <b>Sparrow</b> with a jar of dirt - Jones can only set foot on land once every 10 years, and since land is where <b>Sparrow</b> is safe, Dalma suggests with the dirt that he takes land with him.|$|E
5|$|Hybridisation {{between the}} Eurasian tree <b>sparrow</b> {{and the house}} <b>sparrow</b> has been {{recorded}} {{in many parts of}} the world with male hybrids tending to resemble the Eurasian tree <b>sparrow</b> while females have more similarities with the house <b>sparrow.</b> A breeding population in the Eastern Ghats of India, said to be introduced, may also hybridise with house sparrows. On at least one occasion a mixed pair has resulted in fertile young. A wild hybridisation with the resident sparrows of Malta, which are intermediate between the Spanish <b>sparrow</b> (P. hispaniolensis) and Italian sparrows (P. italiae), was recorded in Malta in 1975.|$|E

5|$|In {{parts of}} the range, the russet <b>sparrow</b> inhabits towns, and in most of its range, it occurs near cultivation, and is a minor pest of agriculture. Though it damages crops, it also feeds its nestlings largely on insect pests. In China, the russet <b>sparrow</b> has been {{recorded}} as a captive bird, kept with the Eurasian tree <b>sparrow.</b> In Japan it was eaten in the 1870s and sold in the Yokohama game market. The russet <b>sparrow</b> is known well enough in the Himalayas that in most languages it has a different vernacular name from the Eurasian tree <b>sparrow.</b> Examples of these vernacular names include lal gouriya in Hindi and kang-che-go-ma in Tibetan. The Japanese artist Hokusai portrayed the russet <b>sparrow,</b> and due to this, it has appeared on postage stamps featuring Japanese art in Japan, The Gambia, and Guyana.|$|E
5|$|In towns, the Cape <b>sparrow</b> {{competes with}} both the native {{southern}} grey-headed <b>sparrow</b> and house <b>sparrow,</b> which was introduced to southern Africa in the 19thcentury. Since it is more established around humans in its range than either, it successfully competes with both species, though they may exclude it from nesting in holes. A survey by birdwatchers completed in 2000 found the Cape <b>sparrow</b> increasing in abundance in some suburban areas of South Africa (the northern Johannesburg area, and Pietermaritzburg) and decreasing in others (the southern Cape Town area). The house <b>sparrow</b> was reported decreasing in several urban areas, {{as it has in}} parts of Europe, declines which are attributed to factors including the increasing density of garden plantings and increases in predation.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies of}} the house <b>sparrow</b> in {{temperate}} agricultural areas have found the proportion of seeds in its diet to be about 90%. It will eat almost any seeds, but where it has a choice, it prefers oats and wheat. In urban areas, the house <b>sparrow</b> feeds largely on food provided directly or indirectly by humans, such as bread, though it prefers raw seeds. The house <b>sparrow</b> also eats some plant matter besides seeds, including buds, berries, and fruits such as grapes and cherries. In temperate areas, the house <b>sparrow</b> has an unusual habit of tearing flowers, especially yellow ones, in the spring.|$|E
5|$|Tchernov {{argued that}} the house <b>sparrow</b> and related species have {{undergone}} considerable morphological changes in adapting to a commensal relationship with humans, with the beak becoming longer and narrower. He wrote that P.predomesticus was intermediate between the house <b>sparrow</b> and Spanish <b>sparrow</b> (Passer hispaniolensis), and suggested {{that it may be}} a primitive relative of the ancestor of the house <b>sparrow</b> that did not become dependent on humans. In a 1984 paper, Tchernov suggested that the period in which the house <b>sparrow</b> and P.predomesticus could have separated was the Würm glaciation 70,000–10,000 years ago. Markus found that the fossil species was closest to living house sparrows from Palestine and to the great <b>sparrow</b> (P.motitensis), and proposed that the house <b>sparrow</b> evolved in Africa. In a 1977 account of the evolution of the house <b>sparrow,</b> American zoologists Richard F. Johnston and William J. Klitz considered that the house <b>sparrow</b> evolved with the beginning of agriculture, dating any fossils that could even be assigned to the common ancestor of the house and Spanish sparrows as more recent than P.predomesticus. In his 1988 work The Sparrows, British ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith considered that P.predomesticus was roughly contemporary with the common ancestor of the house and Spanish sparrows and that all present-day Palaearctic Passer species evolved later. Drawing on more recent studies of molecular data, Ted R. Anderson stated in his 2006 Biology of the Ubiquitous House <b>Sparrow</b> that all Passer species have a long evolutionary history, with speciation possibly occurring as early as the Miocene.|$|E
5|$|The Cape <b>sparrow</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller in 1776, as Loxia melanura. Some other earlier biologists described the Cape <b>sparrow</b> in Loxia or Fringilla, {{but it has}} otherwise been regarded {{as a member of}} the genus Passer along with the house <b>sparrow</b> and other sparrows of the Old World. Within this genus, morphological comparisons and geography were insufficient to elucidate to which species the Cape <b>sparrow</b> is most closely related. Mitochondrial DNA phylogenies have strongly suggested that the Cape <b>sparrow</b> is among the most basal members of its genus, having diverged from the rest of the genus during the late Miocene, over 5million years ago. It is genetically closest to the southern grey-headed <b>sparrow</b> and the other grey-headed sparrows of Africa and the saxaul <b>sparrow</b> of Central Asia, so these species may be sibling species of the Cape <b>sparrow</b> or similarly early offshoots.|$|E

40|$|Birds lose feathers, whether during molt or by accident, {{and replace}} them by {{processes}} that are energetically demanding. We hypothesized that house <b>sparrows</b> Passer domesticus biblicus use behavioral means to save energy when feathers are lost, and tested the general prediction that house <b>sparrows</b> growing new feathers adjust their behavior to minimize the energy costs of foraging and to increase net energy gain from their food. To test these predictions we divided 18 house <b>sparrows</b> into three groups: 1) plucked – house <b>sparrows</b> from which we plucked 15 flight feathers; 2) cut – house <b>sparrows</b> in which the same 15 feathers were cut off at the calamus below the barbs; and 3) control – unmanipulated house <b>sparrows</b> with plumage intact. We recorded both the quantity of seeds the house <b>sparrows</b> ate and the time they spent foraging from assay food patches. We found that ‘plucked’ <b>sparrows</b> growing new feathers adjust their foraging behavior by reducing their feeding time {{and the number of}} visits to a food patch. This allowed them to increase their patch harvest rate while maintaining a steady body mass...|$|R

5|$|The Iago <b>sparrow</b> {{was once}} thought to be most closely related to the rufous sparrows, a group of species within the genus Passer which live in similar {{habitats}} on continental Africa. Though the Iago <b>sparrow</b> is closest to the rufous sparrows in appearance, it has a number of crucial differences in morphology and behavior, and is separated by thousands of kilometres. It may in fact be more closely related to the house <b>sparrow</b> and Spanish <b>sparrow.</b> In Cape Verde it occurs on all but one island, and on most of them it is quite common. The Iago <b>sparrow</b> occurs in most habitats on available in its range, such as lava plains, rocky hills, and gorges; however, the house <b>sparrow</b> and Spanish <b>sparrow</b> are typically present instead in denser settlements and richer cultivated areas respectively. Because the Iago <b>sparrow</b> is not under any serious threats, it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The Sind <b>sparrow</b> (Passer pyrrhonotus) is a {{passerine}} bird of the <b>sparrow</b> family Passeridae, found {{around the}} Indus valley region in South Asia. It {{is also known}} as the jungle, Sind jungle, or rufous-backed <b>sparrow.</b> Very similar to the related house <b>sparrow,</b> it is smaller and has distinguishing plumage features. As in the house <b>sparrow,</b> the male has brighter plumage than female and young birds, including black markings and a grey crown. Distinctively, the male has a chestnut stripe running down its head behind the eye, and the female has a darker head than other <b>sparrow</b> species do. Its main vocalisations are soft chirping calls that are extended into longer songs with other sounds interspersed by breeding males. Historically, this species was thought to be very closely related to the house <b>sparrow,</b> but its closest evolutionary affinities may lie elsewhere. Discovered around 1840, this species went undetected for several decades after its discovery.|$|E

5|$|The {{courtship}} {{display is}} poorly recorded. Ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith observed a display {{in which the}} male hopped beside the female in a tree, drooping its wings and ruffling the chestnut-coloured feathers on its back. Groups {{of two or more}} males have been observed chasing a female. In the house <b>sparrow</b> a similar display exists, in which a female who is not ready to copulate is chased by her mate, who is joined by other males. It is not known if the display in the Cape <b>sparrow</b> has a similar significance. When ready to mate, the female crouches in solicitation and is mounted by the male. Instances of hybridisation with the house <b>sparrow,</b> the southern grey-headed <b>sparrow,</b> and captives or escapees of the Sudan golden <b>sparrow</b> have been reported.|$|E
5|$|The house <b>sparrow</b> is host to a {{huge number}} of parasites and diseases, and the effect of most is unknown. Ornithologist Ted R. Anderson listed thousands, noting that his list was incomplete. The {{commonly}} recorded bacterial pathogens of the house <b>sparrow</b> are often those common in humans, and include Salmonella and Escherichia coli. Salmonella is common in the house <b>sparrow,</b> and a comprehensive study of house <b>sparrow</b> disease found it in 13% of sparrows tested. Salmonella epidemics in the spring and winter can kill large numbers of sparrows. The house <b>sparrow</b> hosts avian pox and avian malaria, which it has spread to the native forest birds of Hawaii. Many of the diseases hosted by the house <b>sparrow</b> are also present in humans and domestic animals, for which the house <b>sparrow</b> acts as a reservoir host. Arboviruses such as the West Nile virus, which most commonly infect insects and mammals, survive winters in temperate areas by going dormant in birds such as the house <b>sparrow.</b> A few records indicate disease extirpating house <b>sparrow</b> populations, especially from Scottish islands, but this seems to be rare.|$|E
5|$|The immune {{response}} of tree sparrows is less robust {{than that of}} the house <b>sparrow</b> and has been proposed as a factor in the greater invasive potential of the latter.

The maximum recorded age is 13.1 years, but three years is a typical lifespan.|$|E
40|$|Hosts {{can manage}} {{parasitic}} infections using {{an array of}} tactics, which are likely to vary contingent on coevolutionary history between the host and the parasite. Here we asked whether coping ability of congeners that differ in host-parasite coevolutionary history differed in response to experimental infections with a coccidian parasite. House <b>sparrows</b> (Passer domesticus) and gray-headed <b>sparrows</b> (Passer griseus) are sympatric and ecologically similar, but house <b>sparrows</b> are recent colonizers of Kenya, the site of our comparison, whereas gray-headed <b>sparrows</b> are native. We evaluated three variables as barometers of infection coping ability: vertical flight, pectoral muscle size, and fat score. We also measured routing of a dose of 13 C-labeled leucine, an essential amino acid, among tissues to compare resource allocation strategies in response to infection. We found that burden effects on performance were minimal in both species, but house <b>sparrows</b> maintained considerably higher burdens than gray-headed <b>sparrows</b> regardless of exposure. House <b>sparrows</b> also had more exogeneous leucine tracer in all tissues after 24 h, demonstrating {{a difference in the}} way the two species allocate or distribute resources. We argue that house <b>sparrows</b> may be maintaining larger resource reserves to mitigate costs associated with exposure and infection. Additionally, in response to increased parasite exposure, gray-headed <b>sparrows</b> had less leucine tracer in their spleens and more in their gonads, whereas house <b>sparrows</b> did not change allocation, perhaps indicating a trade-off that is not experienced by the introduced species...|$|R
40|$|Cryptosporidiosis is a {{cosmopolitan}} parasitosis that affects {{a wide range}} of hosts including birds. As information concerning Cryptosporidium in birds is limited, the present study examined the prevalence and genotypes of Cryptosporidium in Java <b>sparrows</b> in Beijing and Shangqiu, northern China. Three hundred and fifty fecal samples were collected from Java <b>sparrows</b> (Lonchura oryzivora, 225 white Java <b>sparrows</b> and 125 gray Java <b>sparrows)</b> in Beijing and Shangqiu in October 2015, and the samples were examined by PCR amplification of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene. The overall Cryptosporidium prevalence is 13. 42 % (47 / 350), with 16. 44 % (37 / 225) in white Java <b>sparrows</b> and 8. 00 % (10 / 125) in gray Java <b>sparrows.</b> Cryptosporidium prevalence was 9. 82 % (16 / 163) in Java <b>sparrows</b> from Beijing and 16. 58 % (31 / 187) in Java <b>sparrows</b> from Shangqiu. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium in females and males was 40. 63 % (26 / 64) and 7. 34 % (21 / 286), respectively. The Cryptosporidium prevalence in Java <b>sparrows</b> of different ages varied from 10. 47 % to 16. 33 %. Sequence analysis of the SSU rRNA gene revealed that all the samples represented C. baileyi. This is the first report of Cryptosporidium in gray Java <b>sparrows</b> in China, which extend the host range for C. baileyi.
