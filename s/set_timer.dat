50|$|Kosmos 482 was {{launched}} by a Molniya booster on March 31, 1972, 4 {{days after the}} Venera 8 atmospheric probe {{and may have been}} similar in design and mission plan. After achieving an Earth parking orbit, the spacecraft made an apparent attempt to launch into a Venus transfer trajectory. It separated into four pieces, two of which remained in low Earth orbit and decayed within 48 hours into south New Zealand (known as the Ashburton balls incident), and two pieces (presumably the payload and detached engine unit) went into a higher 210 x 9800 km orbit. An incorrectly <b>set</b> <b>timer</b> caused the Blok L stage to cut off prematurely, preventing the probe from escaping Earth orbit.|$|E
40|$|MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network) is the {{collection}} of mobile nodes which can move freely. Broadcasting is a fundamental operation in Mobile Ad Hoc Network MANETs. There are various broadcasting techniques to discover the route. Simple flooding {{is one of the}} broadcasting mechanisms for route discovery where a node rebroadcast request packet until a route established. Through a mechanism it cause some problem called as broadcast storm problem, it cause redundant retransmission, collision, and contention in network. Neighbor coverage based probabilistic rebroadcast routing protocol is used to overcome the problem. In this approach first calculate rebroadcast delay, <b>set</b> <b>timer</b> according to rebroadcasting delay and also calculate rebroadcast probability by multiplying the additional coverage ratio and connectivity factor. This approach can significantly reduce the routing overhead, increase packet delivery ratio and reduce end-to-end delay to improve routing performances...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Several {{components}} {{contribute to}} handover delay of Mobile IPv 6, namely, movement detection time, address configuration time, binding registration time, and route optimization time. Through testbed experiments, {{we found that}} the dominating delay component is the address configuration time, which is the time required to configure a new globally routable IPv 6 address on the mobile node after it moves to a foreign network. A typical process of IPv 6 address configuration requires a duplicate address detection (DAD) procedure. During DAD, a mobile node sends a neighbor solicitation message to ask whether its new address is being used. If no node replies within a <b>set</b> <b>timer,</b> a mobile node can assume the new address is unique on that network. On the Linux testbed, DAD takes as much as 1 second, which causes intolerable disruption in case of time-critical applications. This work studies techniques for reducing delay during the DAD procedure. Main contributions of this work are the insights into benefits and shortcomings of different DAD techniques, as well as benchmarks for design of future DAD protocols. I...|$|E

30|$|While {{improvements}} to the building envelope may yield substantial savings, they are relatively costly. Hence, control and automation approaches have gained traction recently. Most commercially available systems work with manually <b>set</b> <b>timers</b> to control the heating (Honeywell Thermostats 2018; British Gas 2018; Climote 2018; Starck 2018). In some cases, an app is used to let the inhabitants easily and remotely control the heating via a smartphone (e.g. Heat Genius Ltd 2018), so they can turn it off while they are not at home, and back on again before they return in order to heat the home prior to arrival.|$|R

30|$|Latha Tamilselvan et al. {{propose a}} {{solution}} {{based on an}} enhancement of the original AODV routing protocol. The major design concept is <b>setting</b> <b>timer</b> in the RimerExpiredTable for collecting the other request from other nodes after receiving the first request. It will store the packet's sequence number and the received time in a Collect Route Reply Table (CRRT), counting the timeout value based on the arriving {{time of the first}} route request, judging the route belong to valid or not based on the above threshold value. The simulation using global mobile simulator (GloMoSim) shows that a higher packet delivery ratio is obtained with only minimal delay and overhead. But the end-to-end delay might be raised visibly when the suspicious node is away from the source node.|$|R

50|$|Standards for {{delivery}} of scheduling information to television-based IPGs vary from application to application, and by country. Older television IPGs like Guide Plus+ relied on analog technology (such as the {{vertical blanking interval}} of analog television video signals) to distribute listings data to IPG-enabled consumer receiving equipment. In Europe, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) published standard ETS 300 707 to standardize the delivery of IPG data over digital television broadcast signals. Listings data for IPGs integrated into digital terrestrial television and radio receivers of the present day is typically sent within each station's MPEG transport stream, or alongside it in a special data stream. The ATSC standard for digital terrestrial television, for instance, uses tables sent in each station's PSIP. These tables are meant to contain program start times and titles along with additional program descriptive metadata. Current time signals are also included for on-screen display purposes, and they are also used to <b>set</b> <b>timers</b> on recording devices.|$|R
