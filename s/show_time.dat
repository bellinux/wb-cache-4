25|$|In recent years, some {{shows have}} moved their Tuesday <b>show</b> <b>time</b> {{an hour earlier}} to 7:00p.m. The {{rationale}} for the move was that since fewer tourists take in shows midweek then the Tuesday attendance, in particular, depends on the local audience.

Some shows, especially those produced by Disney, change their performance schedules fairly frequently depending on the season. This is done in order to maximize access to their target audience.|$|E

25|$|In an {{interview}} with Marc Maron that summer, Andy Richter noted the contradiction between Ebersol's comments and {{the actions of the}} network. The demonstrable impact of The Jay Leno Show on the ratings of local news across the country was the direct cause of the cancellation of The Jay Leno Show, and gave lie to Ebersol's implication that lead-ins are irrelevant. Leno's Tonight Show, in contrast, had always enjoyed healthy lead-ins courtesy of a strong NBC primetime line-up. Furthermore, the network would have reportedly faced a US$150 million penalty in order to release Leno from his contract, making O'Brien the far less expensive host to get rid of and running counter to the assertion that his ratings were the cardinal factor in being pushed out of the traditional Tonight <b>Show</b> <b>time</b> slot.|$|E

Two band members made it to the US while two were stuck in London. Subsequently, they all made it to the lone US tour stop in Boston days later but failed to recover any of their luggage, forcing them to shop for clothes on Newbury St. that afternoon.

500|$|The {{remains of}} St. Leonard's Hospital chapel and undercroft {{are on the}} east side of the gardens, by the Museum Street entrance. The {{hospital}} was the largest in England during the Middle Ages, and was run by a community of men and women of the Augustinian order. During the 14th century, the hospital could have contained as many as 240 patients, 18 clergy and 30 choristers. [...] St. Leonard's Hospital was closed during the dissolution of the monasteries, when it was surrendered to Henry VIII by Thomas Magnus. [...] The undercroft and chapel were part of the infirmary built between 1225 and 1250. The interior of the undercroft, accessible from the gardens, has a rib vaulted ceiling [...] and houses a collection of Roman and medieval stonework.

500|$|... "Go Big or Go Home" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim, {{with several}} critics particularly complimenting the [...] "Swanson Pyramid of Greatness" [...] joke. HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall said the episode {{was effective in}} appealing to both new and old viewers, developing various character subplots and establishing the harvest festival story arc. He also praised the performances of Chris and Ann, which he called a far better and more interesting pairing than Ann with Mark Brendanawicz. Linda Holmes of NPR suggested the season premiere {{was a good place}} for newcomers to the series to start watching. She said all the characters were funny and the two new cast members had been seamlessly integrated into the <b>show.</b> <b>Time</b> magazine writer James Poniewozik called the episode an [...] "excellent start" [...] to the season, and said the harvest festival subplot would help better focus the series by giving the characters a single goal. Poniewozki said it also [...] "reminds us that the show is about something: the idea, maybe quaint-seeming in this political climate, that civil servants can actually see themselves as servants and work in their community's interest". Damian Holbrook of TV Guide said [...] "Go Big or Go Home" [...] was an improvement on an already strong second season, claiming [...] "the comedy seemed snappier, the relationships better grounded and the ensemble cast at their best." ...|$|E
500|$|TV Squad's Bob Sassone enjoyed Jan Hooks' appearance, {{and said}} that her role as Jenna's mother was [...] "good casting." [...] His only {{complaint}} was that this episode {{had nothing to do}} with The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan, the fictional show on 30 Rock, and hoped that no other characters have to stay at Liz's apartment. [...] "Laughter wasn't constant during , but the direction it moved in kept interest even when jokes were sparse. That being said, some of the material... were pretty great by even the show's lofty standards", said Paste magazine's Sean Gandert. In his recap, Adam Mersel for TV Guide was complimentary, writing it had [...] "spot-on one-liners, witty pop culture references, and a hilarious guest-star in Jan Hooks", and that [...] "Verna" [...] became his favorite episode of the season. Nick Catucci for New York magazine liked Liz and Frank's plot, noting that their bad habits featured here [...] "culminated in the greatest few moments the show has had in some time." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed this episode of 30 Rock, writing that the show [...] "was firing on all cylinders. It was good for laughs aplenty but it also helped illuminate Jack's paternal relationship with Jenna, the source of some of Jenna's narcissistic craziness and the full measure of Jack's Oedipal hell." [...] Margaret Lyons for Entertainment Weekly deemed [...] "Verna" [...] a solid episode from the <b>show.</b> <b>Time</b> contributor James Poniewozik enjoyed Hooks' performance, and that it was good to see Jane Krakowski's Jenna [...] "get a story that was not solely about her being an insecure ninny." ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{wrote that}} despite [...] "Don Geiss, America and Hope" [...] not being [...] "strong" [...] {{as the last}} episode it had [...] "many funny moments scattered throughout" [...] that he was satisfied with. He noted that the uncomfortable relationship between Liz and Wesley [...] "worked better" [...] here than previously. Sepinwall said it [...] "was a good story" [...] for Jack's character, {{and that it was}} [...] "nice" [...] to see 30 Rock [...] "fearless about mocking their future Comcast overlords as they are at making fun of NBC". The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed Michael Sheen's return, said that every part of Liz and Wesley's story was [...] "brilliant". He observed that Jack's midlife crisis here was [...] "poignant as well as funny." [...] Overall, Rabin gave it a B+ rating, and concluded [...] "...it was a rock-solid episode". Despite enjoying Sheen's role on the <b>show,</b> <b>Time</b> contributor James Poniewozik confessed he had a problem with his story arc with Tina Fey's Liz. [...] "I assume that [...] is not going to become a permanent cast member, and so however much I might enjoy parts of this story, I can never forget that this is probably one more relationship that Liz will go through and end up at status quo ante." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was complimentary towards the NBC/Kabletown deal, enjoyed Tracy's subplot, noting it gave the character [...] "something important to do... it also shined some new light on the Tracy Morgan character." [...] Adam Mersel for TV Guide reasoned [...] "I can officially say that almost no episode of 30 Rock falls flat for me, and this one certainly didn't [...] All in all, {{this is one of my}} favorite episodes of the season." [...] Paste magazine contributor Sean Gandert was favorable to it, noting [...] "I'm not sure when the last time I thought every plot in a 30 Rock episode was a winner, but 'Don Geiss, Hope and America' delivered on the exuberant claims of the episode's title". Nick Catucci of New York magazine wrote that Jack trying to fit in at Kabletown, along with his suggestion of [...] "porn for women", was [...] "meh", Liz dealing with Wesley and Tracy [...] "dealing with the world's discovery of his fidelity to his wife" [...] were all [...] "quite comfortably situated in the show's wheelhouse".|$|E
