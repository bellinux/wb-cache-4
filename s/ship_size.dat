The total number of ocean-going transits increased from 11,725 in 2003 to 13,233 in 2007, falling to 12,855 in 2009. (The canal's fiscal year runs from October through September.) This has been coupled with a steady rise in average <b>ship</b> <b>size</b> and {{in the numbers of}} Panamax vessels passing through the canal, so that the total tonnage carried rose from 227.9 million PC/UMS tons in fiscal year 1999 to a then record high of 312.9 million tons in 2007, and falling to 299.1 million tons in 2009. Tonnage for fiscal 2013, 2014 and 2015 was 320.6, 326.8 and 340.8 million PC/UMS tons carried on 13,660, 13,481 and 13,874 transits respectively.|$|E

500|$|In 1882, the U.S. Navy {{consisted}} of many outdated ship designs. Over the next decade, Congress approved building multiple modern steel-hulled armored cruisers and battleships, and by around {{the start of}} the 20th century had moved from twelfth place in 1870 to fifth place in terms of numbers of ships. After winning two major battles during the 1898 Spanish–American War, the American Navy continued to build more ships, {{and by the end of}} World War I had more men and women in uniform than the British Royal Navy. The Washington Naval Conference of [...] 1921 recognized the Navy as equal in capital <b>ship</b> <b>size</b> to the Royal Navy, and during the 1920s and 1930s, the Navy built several aircraft carriers and battleships. The Navy was drawn into World War II after the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, and over the next four years fought many historic battles including the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of Midway, multiple naval battles during the Guadalcanal Campaign, and the largest naval battle in history, the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Much of the Navy's activity concerned the support of landings, not only with the [...] "island-hopping" [...] campaign in the Pacific, but also with the European landings. When the Japanese surrendered, a large flotilla entered Tokyo Bay to witness the formal ceremony conducted on the battleship , on which officials from the Japanese government signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. By the end of the war, the Navy had over 1,600 warships.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} in the {{investment}} decision of the entrepreneur (if he should purchase a second hand vessel or build a new one), what matters is not the second hand price and its determinants per se, but instead the ratio (SP/NP) second hand price over the new building price and its movement. We investigate the determinants of this ratio across different <b>ship</b> <b>sizes</b> in the tanker sector and show {{that it can be}} used as an effective tool in decision making as well as in asset evaluation. W e employ monthly data between 1995 and 2006 for four different <b>ship</b> <b>sizes,</b> VLCC, Suezmax, Aframax and Handymax in the tanker sector and implement a GARCH(1, 1) model. It is found that the perception of riskiness directly impacts upon the ratio (SP/NP). An increase in freight volatility leads to an increase in the risk premium across <b>ship</b> <b>sizes</b> and therefore the ratio under examination rises. Furthermore, in the case of Suezmax, the mean ratio is strongly affected by the volatility of shocks to this ratio. Overall we claim that the cyclicality of the shipping sector together with expectations formed by the agents operating in it (the entrepreneur, the ship-owner and the broker), determine the movement of the ratio and hence the decision of the entrepreneur...|$|R
