50|$|The power {{developed}} by an aircraft engine under any given external conditions can be computed approximately if the normal {{power at the}} given speed is multiplied by appropriate temperature and pressure correction factors. The temperature correction factor is given by an equation taken from NACA Report No. 45. When the intake and exhaust pressures are equal, {{it is best to}} use an equation {{based on the work of}} NACA Report No. 46 for the pressure correction factor. For unequal intake and exhaust pressures, the correction factor for a small range of values may be taken from a graph in Report No. 45. The temperature rise in the compressor, which has an important part in determining the power output of the engine, can be computed when the pressure ratio, the <b>shaft</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and the heat radiated per pound of air by the compressor and discharge pipe are known. For typical conditions, with the compressor exposed to the full force of the propeller slipstream, the computed value of the ratio of the actual temperature rise to the theoretical rise without heat radiation is 0.864.|$|E
50|$|The {{efficiency}} of the compressor and the power which it absorbs depend on the quantity of air handled per unit time. It therefore becomes necessary to discuss the variation of the volumetric {{efficiency of}} the engine with the intake temperature and the exhaust back pressure. It is presumed that the compressor is designed for operation at a certain normal altitude and normal speed. The calculation of the net horsepower available at the propeller under these normal conditions is particularly simple. In a numerical example {{it is assumed that}} the Liberty engine is fitted with a gear-driven compressor designed to furnish sea-level carburetor pressure at I8,000 feet altitude and an engine speed of 1,700 revolutions per minute. The <b>shaft</b> <b>efficiency</b> of thecompressor is assumed to be 64%. The computed horsepower is 371. In calculating the power of an engine equipped with a turbine-driven compressor, it is assumed that the back pressure created by the turbine is equal to the increase in the carburetor pressureproduced by the blower. The computed power to be expected from a Liberty enbtie fitted with a turbine-driven supercharger under the conditions of the preceding problem is 394.|$|E

40|$|In this project, {{a series}} of {{centrifuge}} tests were conducted to study the behavior of single jacked-in piles and pile groups in both loose (relative density, Dr = 42 %) and dense (relative density, Dr = 73 %) sands. Interaction effects of both free-standing pile groups and pile groups with cap-ground contact were studied. At failure, both the shaft and base resistance were fully mobilized with pile head settlement exceeding 30 % of the pile diameter (0. 3 m). The measured β values for the single pile tests in loose sand and dense sand are 0. 3 and 0. 56, respectively. While for the pile group tests, the measured β values for the group piles are generally the same with each other. In loose sand, the measured β values for freestanding and cap-ground contact groups are 0. 6 and 0. 5, respectively. In dense sand, the measured β values for both freestanding and cap-ground contact groups are 0. 6. Group efficiency factors were calculated using different failure criteria. It {{is clear that the}} total group efficiency values for piles jacked in loose sand interpreted using various failure criteria differ significantly while the values for those piles in dense sand do not differ considerably. The Davisson's failure criterion predicts total group efficiency values of 1. 9 and 1. 5 in loose sand for the free-standing pile groups and the cap-in-contact pile groups, respectively. These set of values are the highest among all the failure criteria. For other criteria, the total efficiency values range from 1. 1 to 1. 3. In dense sand, the total efficiency values within a narrow range from 0. 8 to 1. 1 regardless of the failure criteria. Depending on the selection of failure criteria, it is revealed that the <b>shaft</b> <b>efficiency</b> for loose sand ranges from 2. 7 to 1. 6 and 1. 6 to 1. 3 for free-standing and cap-in-contact pile groups respectively. In contrast, the <b>shaft</b> <b>efficiency</b> varies from 0. 8 to 1. 0 for dense sand. The improved in <b>shaft</b> <b>efficiency</b> in loose sand is probably due to densification of the soil in the pile groups. The point efficiency for piles in loose sand generally ranges from 0. 8 to 0. 9 and 0. 6 to 0. 7 for free-standing and cap-in-contact pile groups respectively. For dense sand, similar results as concluded by Vesic (1968) were obtained where the point efficiency value are also close to 1. 0...|$|E

40|$|Road {{transportation}} using air as a fuel {{has attracted}} much attention over the past decade. The fuel (air) can be in two forms, compressed gas form and cryogenic liquid form and engines based on both forms of air have been investigated. Prototypes of air powered road vehicles are expected to emerge {{over the next few}} years. However, there have been debates over {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the two technologies. This paper aims to compare the two technologies from the technological point of view. Engines for a typical small scale passenger car are used for the analyses and the comparison is based on the <b>shaft</b> work, coolth, <b>efficiency</b> and energy density. It is shown that the shaft work outputs and the coolth available to engines powered by both fuels increase with increasing working pressure and temperature. Given the working pressure and temperature, liquid air powered engines have a slightly lower specific work outputs than compressed air powered engines. The volumetric energy density of liquid air, however, is much higher than that of compressed air, and liquid air has much higher coolth than compressed air. On the other hand, the efficiency of the compressed air powered engines is higher than that of liquid air powered engines mainly because of the higher energy consumption of liquefaction plants. The analyses also suggest that an effective use of coolth be a key to improve the overall efficiency of liquid air powered engines. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{demands for}} {{high-performance}} screw pumps {{in oil and}} gas {{as well as other}} applications require deep understanding of the fluid flow field inside the machine. Important effects on the performance such as dynamic losses, influence of the leakage gaps and presence and extent of cavitation are difficult to observe by experiments. However, it is possible to study such effects using well-validated computational fluid dynamics models. The novel-structured numerical mesh consisting of a single-computational domain for moving screw pump rotors was developed to allow three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation of such machine possible. Based on finite volume method, the instantaneous mass flow rates, rotor torque, local pressure field, velocity field and other performance indicators including the indicated power were predicted. A calculation model for the bearing friction losses was introduced to account for mechanical losses. The geometry of the inlet and outlet passages and piping system are taken into consideration to evaluate their influences on the pressure distribution and shaft power. The paper also shows the influence of rotor clearances on the pump performance. The computational fluid dynamics model was validated by comparing the numerical results with the measured performance obtained in the experimental test rig through the comprehensive experiment performed for a set of discharge pressures and rotational speeds. Validation includes comparison of mass flow rates, <b>shaft</b> power and <b>efficiency</b> under variety of speeds and discharge pressure. It has been found that the predicted results match well with the measurements. The results also showed that the radial clearances have larger influence on the mass flow rate than the interlobe clearance. The correct design of the flow passages within the screw pump plays significant role in minimizing required power consumption. The analysis presented in this paper contributes to better understanding of the working process inside the screw pump and offers a good reference to improve design and optimize such machines in terms of clearance selection, shape of the ports, piping system, etc. In future, this model will be used for analysis of cavitating flows and determining performance of other multiphase screw pumps...|$|R
40|$|To {{increase}} <b>efficiency,</b> <b>shafts</b> {{are made}} lighter and more flexible, and {{are designed to}} rotate faster to increase the system's power-to-weight ratio. The demand for higher efficiency in rotordynamic systems has led to increased susceptibility to transverse fatigue cracking of the shaft. Shaft cracks are often detected and repaired during scheduled periods of off-line maintenance. Off-line maintenance can be expensive and time consuming; on-line condition monitoring allows maintenance to be performed as-needed. However, inadequate (or a lack of) monitoring can allow rapidly propagating cracks to result in catastrophic shaft failure. It is therefore imperative to develop on-line condition monitoring techniques to detect a crack and diagnose its severity. A particularly useful method for transverse shaft crack detection/diagnosis is vibration monitoring. Detection, and especially diagnosis, of transverse fatigue cracks in rotordynamic systems has proven difficult. Whereas detection assesses only {{the presence of a}} crack, diagnosis estimates important crack parameters, such as crack depth and location. Diagnosis can provide the operator with quantitative information to assess further machinery operation. Furthermore, diagnosis provides initial conditions and predictive parameters on which to base prognostic calculations. There is a two-fold challenge for on-line diagnosis of transverse fatigue crack parameters. First, crack characterization involves specifying two important parameters: the crack's depth and location. Second, the nature of rotating machinery permits response measurement at only specific locations. Cracks are typically categorized as breathing or gaping; breathing cracks open and close with shaft rotation, while gaping cracks remain open. This work concerns the diagnosis of gaping crack parameters; the goal is to provide metrics to diagnose a crack's depth and location. To this end, a comprehensive approach is presented for modeling an overhung cracked shaft. Two linear gaping crack models are developed: a notch and a gaping fatigue crack. The notch model best approximates experimentally manufactured cracks, whereas the gaping fatigue crack model is likely more suited for real fatigue cracks. Crack diagnosis routines are established using free and forced response characteristics. Equations of motion are derived for both crack models, including excitation due to gravity and imbalance. Transfer matrix techniques are established to expediently obtain the steady-state system response. A novel transfer matrix technique, the Complex Transfer Matrix, is developed to distinguish forward and backward whirl components. The rotor's angular response is primarily employed in this work for crack detection and diagnosis. The overhung shaft induces an increased sensitivity to variations in crack depth and location. In addition, an available overhung rotordynamic experimental test rig allows for comparison of the current analytic results to previously obtained experimental results. Under the influence of gravity, the steady-state response of the cracked system includes a prominent 2 X harmonic component, appearing at a frequency equal to twice the shaft speed. The magnitude of the 2 X harmonic is strongly influenced by the shaft speed. A resonant response occurs when the shaft speed reaches half of a system natural frequency. This work demonstrates that the profile of the 2 X harmonic versus shaft speed is a capable diagnostic tool. Identification of the 2 X resonance frequency restricts the crack parameters to certain pairs of location and depth. Following this limiting process, the magnitude of the 2 X harmonic is used to identify the crack's depth and location. Orbital shapes at the rotor are discussed, as are orbital modes of the shaft deflection. Quantitative results and qualitative observations are provided concerning the difficulty of crack detection and diagnosis.

40|$|It is an {{accepted}} fact that {{quite a number}} of problems faced in a pumping station are related to the design of sump or intake rather than pump design. Head-capacity curves provided by the pump manufacturer are obtained on the condition of no vortices flowing into the pump intake. The efficiency and performance of pumping stations depend not only on the performance of the selected pumps but also on the proper design of the intake sumps. A faulty design of pump sump can lead to the occurrence of swirl and vortices, which reduce the pump performance and induce vibration and additional noise. Therefore, sump model test is necessary to check the flow condition around intake structure. Numerical simulation is a good facility for reducing the time and cost involved throughout the design process. In this study, the commercial software ANSYS CFX- 13. 0 has been used for the CFD analysis of the sump models. In a scaled sump model for air entrainment simulation, numerical analysis of single phase and two-phase with SST turbulence model was carried out to predict vortex (both free surface vortex and submerged vortex) occurrence and location. The effectiveness of curtain walls and square bars to eliminate the free surface vortex is evaluated. Meanwhile, the experiment including PIV system was performed in KMOU to investigate the flow conditions around pump intake structure. In a full size sump model, overall numerical analysis for the sump model with a mixed flow pump installed was carried out. Hydraulic performances of the mixed flow pump for head rise, <b>shaft</b> power, pump <b>efficiencies</b> versus flow rate changed from 50 % to 140 % of the design flow rate were studied by the performance curves. A trident shaped anti vortex device (AVD) composed of three wall fillets and one center splitter was installed under the pump intake. The effectiveness of the AVD for the suppression of submerged vortex was evaluated. In addition, numerical simulation of cavitation phenomenon in the mixed flow pump has been performed by calculating the full cavitation model with k-琯 turbulence model. According to the results, details of the location, size and strength of vortices were predicted in the numerical simulation. For the scaled sump model, although there is a little difference between the single phase and two-phase simulation, all the results predict the free surface vortex and submerged vortex formation and location. The CFD simulations of flow condition show good agreement with the PIV results. The effectiveness of curtain walls installed to inhibit the free surface vortex is confirmed in the CFD resultswhile the square bars installed in the channel failed to suppress the free surface vortex. For the mixed flow pump with sump, the best efficiency point (BEP) is at the design flow rate with the corresponding efficiency of 89. 6 %. The effectiveness of AVDs installed for the submerged vortex is confirmed by comparisons of the sump model with and without AVD results. Cavitation phenomenon analysis shows the pump operating at the BEP condition has a considerable extent over the requirement of cavitation performance. With numerical simulation, the inception of cavitation in the blade passage is observed on the suction surface where the leading edges meet the tips, and then as the inlet total pressure decrease, the cavitation zone is spread out over the suction surface as well as {{the leading edge of the}} impeller blade.
