40|$|Introduction: There is {{a growing}} body of {{evidence}} suggesting that prototype perceptions are associated with both motivation to engage in, and actual performance of various health behaviors. The current study adopts the prototype willingness (PW) model as a framework for predicting incidental exposure in an extreme ultra-violet radiation (UVR) environment. Specifically, this study aimed to investigate the influence of actor vs. alternate behavioral prototypes on incidental sun exposure. Methods: A cohort study was conducted to examine whether community members' (N= 231) perceptions of various sun-related prototypes influenced their prospective incidental sun exposure. Behavior was assessed using a comprehensive sun diary, and skin reflectance spectrophotometry was used to measure skin color at baseline and at 1 -month follow-up. Results: A path analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between perceptions of <b>sun</b> <b>protector</b> and incidental prototypes and the performance of incidental sun exposure behaviors. Findings indicated that perceptions surrounding sun protection were related to intentions and willingness to incidentally expose. Specifically, perceived dissimilarity to the typical <b>sun</b> <b>protector</b> was directly associated with greater intentions and willingness to expose, and indirectly associated with greater incidental exposure. Conclusions: Overall, an 'alternate' behavioral prototype was found to influence incidental sun exposure behavior. Specifically, perceptions of similarity to the typical <b>sun</b> <b>protector</b> were found to impact upon sun exposure. This finding has implications for skin cancer prevention messages in high-risk regions. Future health promotion strategies in such regions should focus on increasing perceptions of similarity to the <b>sun</b> <b>protector</b> prototype in order to target incidental sun exposure...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Behavioural {{approaches}} to skin cancer prevention have largely focused on sun protection and deliberate sunbathing. In comparison, {{little attention has}} been paid to factors that contribute toward incidental sun exposure. The current study adopts the prototype willingness (PW) model as a framework for predicting incidental exposure in an extreme ultra-violet radiation (UVR) environment. Method: A longitudinal study was conducted to examine whether community members' (N= 231) perceptions of sun-related prototypes influenced prospective incidental sun exposure. In this study, incidental sun exposure was assessed with a comprehensive sun diary, and skin reflectance spectrophotometry was used to measure skin colour at baseline, and again at 1 -month follow-up. Outcomes: Results of this research suggest that deliberate sunbathing is perceived negatively, while sun protection and incidental exposure is evaluated favourably. A path analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between prototype perceptions, other cognitive variables in the model, and incidental exposure behaviours. Findings indicated that perceptions surrounding sun protection were related to intentions and willingness to incidentally expose. More specifically, perceived dissimilarity to the typical <b>sun</b> <b>protector</b> was directly associated with greater intentions and willingness to expose, and indirectly associated with greater incidental exposure. Relevance: Overall, these findings suggest that the PW model can aid the prediction of incidental sun exposure in North Queensland. Furthermore, perceptions of similarity to the typical <b>sun</b> <b>protector</b> were found to impact upon sun exposure. This finding has implications for skin cancer prevention messages in this high-risk region, whereby future health promotion strategies could focus on increasing perceptions of similarity to the <b>sun</b> <b>protector</b> prototype.

40|$|Townsville, in Northern Australia, is {{the skin}} cancer {{capital of the}} world (Buettner & Raasch, 1998). The rates of skin cancer {{observed}} in this region is likely to be due to a combination of environmental, genetic, and lifestyle factors including an extreme ultra violet radiation (UVR) environment, a predominantly fair skinned population, and a climate that facilitates being outdoors (Xiang et al., 2015). Under these conditions, skin damage may be acquired in the course of daily activities via incidental sun exposure. Behavioural approaches to skin cancer prevention have largely focused on sun protection and deliberate sunbathing. In comparison, little {{attention has been paid to}} damage acquired via incidental sun exposure. In order to examine the psychosocial factors that relate to incidental sun exposure, an appropriate theoretical framework must be adopted. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to skin cancer risk factors, and an overview of research relating to sun related behaviours. This thesis adopts the prototype willingness (PW) model (Gibbons, Gerrard, & Lane, 2003) as a framework for predicting incidental sun exposure in an extreme ultraviolet radiation (UVR) environment. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the PW model, and a discussion of the empirical evidence for the model. The PW model is a dual process model of health behaviour that includes both reasoned and reactive processes to decision making. The decision making processes underlying reasoned behaviours, such as sunbathing, are deliberative and planned. On the other hand, reactive behaviours, such as incidental sun exposure, are influenced by social and situational cues. Given that incidental sun exposure is unplanned and non-deliberative, the social reactive pathway of the PW model may provide a useful framework for the examination of this behaviour. Social images, or prototypes, are a crucial component in the social-reaction pathway of the PW model. The first study aimed to determine whether social images existed for sun-related behaviours. Chapter 3 reports on the first study of this research project. Using qualitative research methods, the aim of the first study was to examine whether definitive social images existed for each of the sun-related behaviours. Twenty-eight Townsville residents were recruited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were conducted to establish whether distinct prototypes existed for each of the sun-related behaviours, and to explore the nature of the characteristics associated with each of the prototypes. Results indicated that stable social images existed for all three sun-related behaviours (<b>sun</b> <b>protector,</b> sunbather, incidental exposer). Furthermore, the majority of participants reported that they felt most similar to the incidental exposer prototype. Chapter 4 reports on the second study of this project. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to determine whether the social reactive pathway of the PW model could account for typical incidental sun exposure behaviour. In total, 204 participants from the Townsville region completed a survey about their typical incidental sun exposure, and the PW model variables. Analyses were conducted to determine whether reasoned or reactive decision-making processes were involved in the performance of incidental sun exposure. Results suggested that both intention and willingness contributed unique variance to the prediction of behaviour. Further analyses indicated that prototype perceptions were directly related to incidental sun exposure. These findings suggested that both reasoned and reactive processes contributed toward typical exposure behaviour, and that the prototypical incidental exposer influenced whether the individuals' tend to incidentally expose themselves to the sun. Given that prototype perceptions were directly related to behaviour in Study 2, a third study, presented as Chapter 5, was conducted to examine whether prototype perceptions could be manipulated. A longitudinal prospective design was used to examine whether a brief intervention could change prototype perceptions, and whether such a manipulation impacted upon cognitive precursors to behaviour, or behaviour itself. Repeated-measures factorial analyses were undertaken to examine within- and between-group differences. Results suggested that the manipulation was successful for those in the Negative condition immediately following the intervention, but there were no changes observed for any cognitive variables, or for behaviour at the one-month follow-up. These findings suggested that prototype perceptions of the incidental sun exposer can be manipulated with a brief intervention. Finally, path modelling was conducted to explore the pathways between the variables of the social reaction pathway and incidental behaviour. Chapter 6 presents this investigation. Using the prospective data from Study 3 a, variables in the model included past behaviour, perceptions of the typical incidental exposer and the <b>sun</b> <b>protector,</b> and intentions and willingness to incidentally expose. Results indicated that willingness, but not intention, was related to incidental sun exposure. Furthermore, perceptions of the <b>sun</b> <b>protector</b> were more strongly related to willingness to incidentally expose, compared to the incidental exposer prototype. Again, these findings suggested that reactive processes to decision making may be more influential for incidental sun exposure. Furthermore, the results suggested that prototypes relating to the <b>sun</b> <b>protector</b> prototype influenced sun exposure behaviour. Chapter 7 provides a general discussion of this set of research studies, including implications for population level health promotion strategies and future research...|$|E

40|$|In environments {{where the}} ambient level of {{ultraviolet}} radiation is high to extreme all year, {{the factors that}} contribute towards incidental sun exposure warrant investigation. Interviews were conducted (n[*]=[*] 28) to explore North Queenslanders' perceptions surrounding the typical person who engages {{in each of the}} following sun-related behaviours: deliberate tanning, artificial tanning, sun protection, and incidental exposure. The data were analysed using principles of thematic content analysis with themes derived from the prototype willingness model. While tanned skin was viewed positively, both the deliberate tanner and artificial tanner prototypes were described negatively. Descriptions of the prototypical <b>sun</b> <b>protector</b> were positive, while descriptions of the incidental exposer were neutral. Participants described all four prototypes using personality descriptors, while physical characteristics were reported for all but the incidental exposer. The current research suggests that distinct prototypes exist across a range of sun-related behaviours and that the prototype willingness model may provide a useful framework for further exploration of incidental sun exposure. In order to reduce the prevalence of skin cancer in North Queensland, incidental sun exposure should be targeted. Future research should explore whether the nature of reported prototype characteristics can lead to the prediction of sun-related behaviours...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: In Australia, {{public health}} {{messages}} have {{warned of the}} dangers of excessive UV exposure for more than thirty years, predominantly through promoting increased sun protection and decreased deliberate sun tanning. Research has pushed for increased knowledge of risks, and a reduction in positive attitudes toward tanning. These messages target the reflective, intentional element of behaviour. While this approach has shown some success, it is limited in its ability to be adapted to regions such as North Queensland where comparatively few people intentionally sunbathe. Despite this, the incidence of skin cancer in North Queensland is {{among the highest in the}} world. This would indicate that much of the damage due to UV exposure happens whilst going about normal daily activities - by incidental sun exposure. Incidental exposure is not planned or deliberate, thus theoretical modeling used in research should reflect this. The overall aim of the current study is to adopt a dual-processing framework to examine the psychosocial variables associated with incidental sun exposure. Method: The current study explored perceptions associated with sun related prototypes. Prototypes are social constructs with social consequences. In a sun protection paradigm these are perceptions about the typical person who deliberately suntans, the typical person who protects themselves from the sun, and the typical person who acquires a tan incidentally. Semi-structured interviews were initially conducted as an exploration followed by a survey which sought to identify the specific characteristics of each of the 'prototypes'. Results: Preliminary results indicated that distinct prototypes exist within a sun protection paradigm. Unlike perceptions surrounding incidental tanners and <b>sun</b> <b>protectors,</b> participants held negative perceptions toward the deliberate tanner prototype. Furthermore, individuals tend to align with the incidental prototype - despite engaging in deliberate tanning behaviours. These unrealistic self perceptions may influence whether individuals attend to health promotion messages which aim to reduce deliberate tanning behaviours. Conclusions: Individuals' prototype perceptions may influence not only sun protective behaviours but also attention to health information. Alignment with a 'prototype' that is incongruent with actual behavior, while holding negative perceptions toward the deliberate tanner may polarise individuals and inhibit behavioural change. Thus, current health promotion campaigns may not be applicable to North Queensland and other climates where comparatively few people deliberately tan...|$|R
50|$|The {{story has}} entered into annals of {{folklore}} in China. It revolves around Xuanzang, a Buddhist monk during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). Harassed by demons and bandits, he visits India, {{accompanied by his}} disciples, and <b>protectors,</b> <b>Sun</b> Wukong the Monkey King, Pigsy (猪八戒) and Sandy (沙悟浄). They return to China with Buddhist scriptures. The novel's story became subsumed into the popular culture of China. When the Monkey King appeared in a Buddhist novel, he attained a higher recognition in the cultural ethos of China; temples were built in his honor and his biography was established. The birthday of the Monkey King is observed as the New Year Day, and also as trickster day as he had immeasurable talent and cunning wit.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{major item}} {{featured}} within the popular fantasy novel Journey to the West. The first time in which these immortal peaches were seen had been within heaven when Sun Wukong had been stationed as the Protector of the Peaches. As the <b>Protector,</b> <b>Sun</b> quickly realized the legendary effects of the immortal peaches {{if they were to}} be consumed - over 3,000 years of life after the consumption of a single peach - and acted quickly as to consume one. However, he ended up running into many fragments of trouble such as a certain queen that was planning on holding a peach banquet for many members of Heaven. He manages to make himself very small and hide within a sacred peach. Later on within the series, he would have another chance to eat an immortal fruit - in which would be his second time. A certain 1000 ft tree was stationed behind a monastery run by a Taoist master and his disciples- in which the master had been gone. The tree bore 30 of the legendary Man-fruit(fruits that looked just like a new born, complete with sense organs) once every 10,000 years. The man-fruits would grant 360 years of life to one who merely smelled them and 47,000 years of life to one who consumed them. After this point within the novel, these Immortal Peaches would never be seen again.|$|R
