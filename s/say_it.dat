Jesus Freak Hideout gave it 3½ out of 5 stars <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "nothing groundbreaking" [...] but [...] "still a joy {{to listen}} to". Allmusic gave it 4 out of 5, also <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> is familiar, but <b>says</b> <b>it</b> works to their advantage. Christianity Today gave it a negative review, <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> [...] "has its moments...but not nearly {{enough for them to}} stand out even among the average bands in Christian pop/rock." ...|$|R

5|$|The Warden's House was {{the home}} of the penitentiary's warden. It is located at the northeastern end of the Main Cellblock, next to Alcatraz Lighthouse. The 3-floor 15-room mansion was built in 1921 {{according}} to the Golden Gate National Recreational Area signpost, although some sources <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was built in 1926 or 1929 and had 17 or 18 rooms.|$|E

5|$|A {{pandemic}} is {{a worldwide}} epidemic. The 1918 flu pandemic, which lasted until 1919, was a category 5 influenza pandemic {{caused by an}} unusually severe and deadly influenza A virus. The victims were often healthy young adults, in contrast to most influenza outbreaks, which predominantly affect juvenile, elderly, or otherwise-weakened patients. Older estimates <b>say</b> <b>it</b> killed 40–50million people, while more recent research suggests {{that it may have}} killed as many as 100million people, or 5% of the world's population in 1918.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the account}} of Onofrio Panvinio, Cardinal John of Toledo {{suggested}} that the roof be removed ("Let us uncover the Room, else the Holy Ghost will never get at us"—the first recorded reference {{to the notion that}} the Holy Spirit should guide cardinal electors), which the two magistrates readily obliged. Other sources <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was Charles of Anjou who orchestrated the reduction of the diet of the cardinals to bread and water and removal the roof of the Papal Palace.|$|E
5|$|At {{first it}} always bothers you {{even though you}} <b>say</b> <b>it</b> doesn't. But I think {{if you want to}} exceed limits, you have to suck that all in and be happy with what you have.

Junius P. Rodriguez <b>says</b> <b>it</b> is [...] "universally condemned as the U.S. Supreme Court's worst decision". Historian David Thomas Konig <b>says</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "unquestionably, our court's worst decision ever".|$|R
5|$|Critics of the {{argument}} include Averroes, who objected to its methodology, Al-Ghazali, who disagreed with its characterization of God, and modern critics who state that its piecemeal derivation of God's attributes allows people to accept parts of {{the argument}} but still reject God's existence. There is no consensus among modern scholars on the classification {{of the argument}}; some {{say that it is}} ontological while others <b>say</b> <b>it</b> is cosmological.|$|E
5|$|Friends and comrades, {{the light}} {{has gone out}} of our lives, and there is {{darkness}} everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to <b>say</b> <b>it.</b> Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.|$|E
5|$|I am vexed and {{surprised}} at your not thinking {{the situation of}} Maria sufficiently important, and can only account for this want of – shall I <b>say</b> <b>it?</b> delicacy of feeling, by recollecting {{that you are a}} man – For my part I cannot suppose any situation more distressing than for a woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound, to such a man as I have described, for life – obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections, and to avoid cultivating her taste lest her perception of grace, and refinement of sentiment should sharpen to agony the pangs of disappointment.|$|E

5|$|It is counted {{little better}} than a kite, for it is of ravenous quality, and is very mischievous; it will steal and carry away any thing it finds about the house, that is not too heavy, tho' not fit for its food; as knives, forks, spoons and linnen cloths, or {{whatever}} it can fly away with, sometimes they <b>say</b> <b>it</b> has stolen bits of firebrands, or lighted candles, and lodged them in the stacks of corn, and the thatch of barns and houses, and set them on fire; but this I only had by oral tradition.|$|E
5|$|Its {{large size}} {{may have been}} due to climactic factors and the {{abundance}} of large prey items, and it may have also been influenced by the evolution of regional endothermy (mesothermy) which would have increased its metabolism. However, since the Otodontidae sharks are considered to have been ectotherms, and megalodon was a close relative to them, megalodon may have also been ectothermic. Contrary to this, the largest contemporary ectothermic sharks, such as the whale shark, are filter feeders, implying some metabolic constraints with a predatory lifestyle. That is to <b>say,</b> <b>it</b> is unlikely that megalodon was ectothermic.|$|E
5|$|Much {{research}} has been done into erection. By two years post-injury, 80% of men recover at least partial erectile function, though many experience problems with the reliability and duration of their erections if they do not use interventions to enhance them. Studies have found that half or up to 65% of men with SCI have orgasms, although the experience may feel different than it did before the injury. Most men <b>say</b> <b>it</b> feels weaker, and takes longer and more stimulation to achieve.|$|E

5|$|Rockall {{is a small}} rocky islet in the North Atlantic {{which was}} {{declared}} part of Scotland by the Island of Rockall Act 1972.

5|$|Sharks {{generally}} are opportunistic feeders, but scientists propose that megalodon was largely predatory. Its great size, high-speed swimming capability, and powerful jaws, {{coupled with a}} formidable feeding apparatus, made it an apex predator capable of consuming {{a broad spectrum of}} animals. A study focusing on calcium isotopes of extinct and extant elasmobranch sharks and rays revealed that megalodon fed at a higher trophic level than the contemporaneous great white shark, that is to <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was higher up in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|The bronze nails, {{with their}} flat tops and raised edges which prevent coins from {{tumbling}} onto the pavement, were made as convenient tables at which merchants could {{carry out their}} business.

The two remaining nails are dated 1625 and 1631.|$|E
5000|$|I <b>say</b> <b>it's</b> spinach (sometimes {{given in}} full as I <b>say</b> <b>it's</b> spinach and I say {{the hell with}} it or further {{abbreviated}} to just spinach) is a twentieth-century American idiom with the approximate meaning of [...] "nonsense" [...] or [...] "rubbish".
