5|$|Hurricane Gordon was {{the seventh}} named <b>storm</b> <b>and</b> third {{hurricane}} of the 1994 Atlantic hurricane season. Although it never made landfall as a hurricane, in its meandering course the storm included six separate landfalls: four as a tropical <b>storm</b> <b>and</b> two as a tropical depression. Three of its landfalls {{were in the}} U.S. state of Florida.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area developed along {{the end of a}} quasi-stationary frontal trough. Initially, vertical wind shear prevented deep convection from forming on the western portion of the system. After wind shear decreased, the system became a gale center late on October 22. By early on the following day, the gale center had transitioned into a tropical <b>storm,</b> <b>and</b> it is estimated that Tropical Storm Frances developed at 0600UTC on October 23. Frances quickly strengthened after becoming a tropical <b>storm,</b> <b>and</b> was upgraded to a hurricane by 1800UTC on that same day. After becoming a hurricane, Frances curved northeastward, and remained well east of Bermuda. By midday on October 24, Frances peaked as an 85mph (140km/h) Category1 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|After {{playing for}} more than 16 hours per week, the group were {{contacted}} by Allan Williams, who wanted {{them to go to}} Hamburg. Derry and the Seniors were successful there, and Williams wanted an additional group. As <b>Storm</b> <b>and</b> the group were committed to Butlins, they turned Williams' offer down (as did Gerry and the Pacemakers) so Williams sent the Beatles to Hamburg instead. After the summer season ended in early October 1960, <b>Storm</b> <b>and</b> the Hurricanes were free to travel to Hamburg, replacing Derry and the Seniors at the Kaiserkeller. They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960, having negotiated to be paid more than the Seniors or the Beatles. They played five or six 90-minute sets every day alternating with The Beatles. <b>Storm</b> <b>and</b> The Hurricanes were later presented with a special certificate by Bruno Koschmider (the owner of the Kaiserkeller) for their performances.|$|E

30|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{systematically}} examine the general features of the trough position by undertaking a superposed epoch analysis. We focus on the differences seen in different categories of magnetic <b>storms</b> <b>and</b> different <b>storm</b> intensities. The paper begins with reviewing satellite data, identification of <b>storms</b> <b>and</b> method of superposed epoch analysis in “Data and Methodology” section. In “Results” section, we present the results for different categories of magnetic <b>storms</b> <b>and</b> different <b>storm</b> intensities. Fourth <b>and</b> fifth sections present the “Discussion” and “Conclusions” of the paper.|$|R

50|$|Since the 2000 typhoon season, the Laboratory for Atmospheric Research or the Guy Carpenter Asia-Pacific Climate Impact Centre (GCACIC), {{both of the}} City University of Hong Kong {{have issued}} {{forecasts}} of activity for each upcoming typhoon season.

This season, the GCACIC is predicting a slightly more active than usual season. An average season, according to the GCACIC, has 31 tropical cyclones, 27 named <b>storms,</b> <b>and</b> 17 typhoons. In its April forecast, the GCACIC predicted 33 total tropical cyclones, 30 named <b>storms,</b> <b>and</b> 19 typhoons before predicting the same number of systems, tropical <b>storms,</b> <b>and</b> typhoons in its June forecast.|$|R
