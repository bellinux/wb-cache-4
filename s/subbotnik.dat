His mother, Vera, was {{from a family of}} Russian <b>Subbotnik</b> Jewish origin. His parents met while at university in Tiflis (now Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia), where Sharon's father was studying agronomy and his mother was studying medicine. They immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1922 {{in the wake of the}} Russian Communist government's growing persecution of Jews in the region. In Palestine, Vera Scheinerman went by the name Dvora.|$|E

50|$|The first all-Russian <b>subbotnik</b> {{was held}} on May 1, 1920, and Vladimir Lenin participated in {{removing}} building rubble in the Moscow Kremlin, an episode portrayed in a famous painting by Vladimir Krikhatsky, Lenin at the First <b>Subbotnik,</b> of Lenin carrying a log.|$|E
50|$|Under Nicholas I, the <b>Subbotniks</b> {{began to}} feel restless. Some wanted to embrace Judaism and {{traveled}} into the Pale of Settlement {{in order to learn}} more about Judaism. Upon learning this, the Russian government sent a number of priests to the <b>Subbotniks</b> to try to persuade them to return to Russian Orthodoxy. When the priests did not meet with any appreciable success, the government decided to suppress the <b>Subbotniks</b> with force. In 1826, the government decided to deport those who lived openly as <b>Subbotniks</b> to internal exile in the above-mentioned regions in the Caucasus, Transcaucasia, and Siberia. At the same time, it prohibited Jews and members of the Russian Orthodox Church from settling among any <b>Subbotniks.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Subbotniks,</b> meaning sabbatarians {{for their}} {{observance}} of the Sabbath on Saturday, {{as in the}} Old Testament, rather than on Sunday, arose {{as part of the}} Spiritual Christian movement in the 18th century. Imperial Russian officials and Orthodox clergy considered the <b>Subbotniks</b> to be heretical to Russian Orthodox religion, and tried to suppress their sects and other Judaizers. They also emphasized individual interpretation of the law rather than accepting the Talmud or clergy. The <b>Subbotniks</b> concealed their religious beliefs and rites from Orthodox Christians. The Russian government eventually deported the <b>Subbotniks,</b> isolating them from Orthodox Christians and Jews.|$|R
50|$|Under Alexander I's {{policies}} of general tolerance, the <b>Subbotniks</b> enjoyed {{a great deal}} of freedom. But the Russian clergy opposed them and killed about 100 <b>Subbotniks</b> and their spiritual leaders in Mogilev, in present-day Belarus, including the former archbishop Romantzov. In addition, Romantzov's young son was tortured with red-hot irons before being burned at the stake. The <b>Subbotniks</b> came to an agreement with the Russian Orthodox priests and succeeded in gaining a measure of peace for a period. To compensate the Church for any loss of finances due to the <b>Subbotniks</b> leaving their congregations, the members of the sect undertook to pay the Church the usual fee of two Russian rubles for every birth and three rubles for every marriage. The tsar permitted the <b>Subbotniks</b> to profess their faith openly, but prohibited them from hiring rabbis or proselytizing among Christians.|$|R

50|$|It {{has been}} {{difficult}} to estimate the exact number of <b>Subbotniks</b> in Russia at any given time. The discrepancies between government statistics and the membership have varied widely. Official data from czarist times placed the membership of the sect at several thousand. The writer E. Dinard, who was in personal contact with the <b>Subbotniks,</b> said in 1887 there were 2,500,000. Dinard may have included in his figures all of the Judaizing sects, and not just the <b>Subbotniks,</b> as this estimate is not supported by any other historians. Apart from their religious rites, the <b>Subbotniks</b> were generally indistinguishable from Russian Orthodox or secular Russians in terms of dress and lifestyle.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1973-1991, the <b>Subbotniks</b> of Ilyinki {{emigrated to}} Israel. After {{the fall of}} the Soviet Union, a few {{thousand}} <b>Subbotniks</b> left Russia for Israel. At this time, there was a 1990s Post-Soviet aliyah to Israel of more than a million ethnic Russian Jews and their immediate family members. Since that period, <b>Subbotniks</b> remaining in Russia have encountered status-related problems. The organization Shavei Israel, dedicated to reaching out to [...] "lost Jews" [...] and related communities, in the 21st century appointed a rabbi for the <b>Subbotniks</b> at Vysokaye, a town in Brest Oblast, Belarus. They intend to teach them Judaism, and encourage them to formally convert to Orthodox Judaism in order to be eligible for aliyah to Israel.|$|R

Their descendants include Israeli Jews such as Rafael Eitan and Alexander Zaïd. [...] Major-General Alik Ron, former head of the Israeli Police's northern district, is also descended from some <b>Subbotnik</b> ancestors, as is the mother of Ariel Sharon.|$|E

50|$|There {{are some}} {{groups that have}} adopted Jewish customs and practices. For example, in Russia the <b>Subbotniks</b> have adopted most aspects of Judaism without formal {{conversion}} to Judaism. However, if <b>Subbotniks,</b> or anyone without a formal conversion, wish to marry into a traditional Jewish community or immigrate to Israel, they must have a formal conversion.|$|R

50|$|<b>Subbotniks</b> in Nazi-occupied {{areas of}} Ukraine {{were killed by}} Nazi {{soldiers}} and local Ukrainian collaborators due to their Jewish self-identity. They were relatively recent migrants to Ukraine from areas of Voronezh and considered outsiders by the peasants, who noted their practice of some Jewish customs. During the Holocaust, Nazis killed thousands of <b>Subbotniks.</b> By contrast, they did not attack Crimean Karaites, accepting the state's records that they were ethnic Russians (or Crimeans).|$|R

After that year, the government deported those who openly acknowledged their membership in the sect to the foothills of the Caucasus, to Transcaucasia, and to the governments of Irkutsk, Tobolsk, and Yeniseisk, in Siberia.
