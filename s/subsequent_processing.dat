5|$|Carbon fiber {{is made by}} {{pyrolysis}} of extruded {{and stretched}} filaments of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and other organic substances. The crystallographic structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend {{on the type of}} starting material, and on the <b>subsequent</b> <b>processing.</b> Carbon fibers made from PAN have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite, but thermal processing may re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet. The result is fibers with higher specific tensile strength than steel.|$|E

40|$|There is now growing {{evidence}} that output promotes second language acquisition. Recently, interest {{has been shown}} in examining (a) the effect of output <b>processing</b> on <b>subsequent</b> input <b>processing,</b> and (b) what factors mediate that effect. An experiment was conducted for two proficiency levels of Japanese learners of English under two conditions (output and non-output). First, participants in the output condition wrote a story in English based on four cartoon pictures (output task processing). Second, participants in both conditions read a model story describing the four cartoon pictures (<b>subsequent</b> input <b>processing).</b> Third, both sets of participants were asked, without any advance notice, to recall what they had read (written free recall test). Performance on the written free recall test suggests that (a) output tasks facilitated <b>subsequent</b> input <b>processing,</b> and (b) complex relationships existed among L 2 proficiency levels, experiment conditions, and linguistic domains during <b>subsequent</b> input <b>processing.</b> These findings are discussed with reference to second language acquisition research. Implications for pedagogical practice are also considered...|$|R
25|$|Polysilicon {{is not a}} great {{conductor}} (approximately 1000 {{times more}} resistive than metals) which reduces the signal propagation speed through the material. The resistivity can be lowered by increasing the level of doping, but even highly doped polysilicon is not as conductive as most metals. To improve conductivity further, sometimes a high-temperature metal such as tungsten, titanium, cobalt, and more recently nickel is alloyed with the top layers of the polysilicon. Such a blended material is called silicide. The silicide-polysilicon combination has better electrical properties than polysilicon alone and still does not melt in <b>subsequent</b> <b>processing.</b> Also the threshold voltage is not significantly higher than with polysilicon alone, because the silicide material is not near the channel. The process in which silicide is formed on both the gate electrode and the source and drain regions is sometimes called salicide, self-aligned silicide.|$|E
25|$|Those {{models that}} {{emphasize}} on lexical processes {{can be further}} {{divided into two groups}} based on how attention is allocated in the reading model. The mainstream model E-Z Reader (Reichle, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 2003), along with older ones like Reader (Just & Carpenter, 1980) and EMMA (Salvucci, 2001) assumes that attention is allocated to only one word sequentially. On the contrary, the SWIFT model assumes that attention in reading is distributed among the currently fixated word and its neighbours. Since attention allocation determines the input stream in these models, difference in attention allocation results in fundamental difference in the <b>subsequent</b> <b>processing</b> and simulation output. E-Z Reader incorporates various lexical properties into a complex structure of interaction between lexical processing, saccade programming and attention shifting; it reproduces the widest range of phenomena in reading behaviours and can be generalised to reading behaviours in elder people, in different languages and in different types of text presentation (Reichle, 2011). In contrast, SWIFT resorts to a dynamic field of parallel activation that stochastically triggers saccade programming, yielding parsimonious simulations of refixation, regression (fixate back to a previous word), and neighbouring effects (how neighbouring words affect the current fixation) (Engbert & Kliegl, 2011). The debate is still on whether attention in reading should be relaxed to more than one word.|$|E

2500|$|The Court {{then turned}} to the extent, if any, to which {{exhaustion}} of the patent rights on the microprocessor products exhausted patent rights relating to the combination products on which LGE had patents.

[...] The Intel microprocessor products were finished commercial articles of commerce, but in this case the trial court had found as a fact that the microprocessor products had no noninfringing use, just as in the Univis case the semifinished lens blanks had no use but to be finished into the patented finished lens blanks. [...] Therefore, the Court found Univis dispositive.
