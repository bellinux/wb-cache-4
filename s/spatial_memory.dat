5|$|Areas of the {{hippocampus}} are {{shown to be}} functionally and anatomically distinct. The dorsal hippocampus (DH), ventral hippocampus (VH) and intermediate hippocampus serve different functions, project with differing pathways, and have varying degrees of place cells. The dorsal hippocampus serves for <b>spatial</b> <b>memory,</b> verbal memory, and learning of conceptual information. Using the radial arm maze, lesions in the DH were shown to cause <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> impairment while VH lesions did not. Its projecting pathways include the medial septal nucleus and supramammillary nucleus. The dorsal hippocampus also has more place cells than both the ventral and intermediate hippocampal regions.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, Richard Morris {{provided}} {{some of the}} first evidence that LTP was indeed required for the formation of memories in vivo. He tested the <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> of rats by pharmacologically modifying their hippocampus, a brain structure whose role in spatial learning is well established. Rats were trained on the Morris water maze, a <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> task in which rats swim in a pool of murky water until they locate the platform hidden beneath its surface. During this exercise, normal rats are expected to associate the location of the hidden platform with salient cues placed at specific positions around the circumference of the maze. After training, one group of rats had their hippocampi bathed in the NMDA receptor blocker APV, while the other group served as the control. Both groups were then subjected to the water maze <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> task. Rats in the control group were able to locate the platform and escape from the pool, while the performance of APV-treated rats was significantly impaired. Moreover, when slices of the hippocampus were taken from both groups, LTP was easily induced in controls, but could not be induced in the brains of APV-treated rats. This provided early evidence that the NMDA receptor — and by extension, LTP — was required for at least some types of learning and memory.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlthough <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> {{has been}} shown to {{play a central role in}} manual IOR (Castel, Pratt, & Craik, 2003), it is so far unclear whether <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> is {{involved}} in saccadic IOR. The present study sought to address this question by using a dual task paradigm, in which the participants performed an IOR task while keeping a set of locations in <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory.</b> While manual IOR was eliminated, saccadic IOR was not affected by <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> load. These findings suggest that saccadic IOR does not rely on <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> to process inhibitory tagging...|$|R

5|$|Rodents have {{advanced}} cognitive abilities. They can quickly learn to avoid poisoned baits, {{which makes them}} difficult pests to deal with.

5|$|The hippocampus, {{strictly}} speaking, {{is found}} only in mammals. However, the area it derives from, the medial pallium, has counterparts in all vertebrates. There is evidence that {{this part of the}} brain is involved in complex events such as <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> and navigation in fishes, birds, reptiles, and mammals.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts possess highly {{developed}} sensory organs. Nearly all daylight fish have colour vision {{at least as}} good as a normal human's. Many fish also have chemoreceptors responsible for acute senses of taste and smell. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Fish sense sounds in a variety of ways, using the lateral line, the swim bladder, and in some species the Weberian apparatus. Fish orient themselves using landmarks, and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Experiments with mazes show that fish possess the <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> needed to make such a mental map.|$|E
40|$|Sleep {{fragmentation}} is {{a common}} symptom in sleep disorders and other medical complaints resulting in excessive daytime sleepiness. The present study seeks to explore the effects of sleep fragmentation on learning and <b>memory</b> in a <b>spatial</b> reference <b>memory</b> task and a <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> task. Fisher/Brown Norway rats lived in custom treadmills designed to induce locomotor activity every 2 minutes throughout a 24 hour period. Separate rats were either on a treadmill schedule that allowed for consolidated sleep or experienced no locomotor activation. Rats were tested {{in one of two}} water maze based tests of learning and memory immediately following 24 hours of sleep interruption (SI). Rats tested in a <b>spatial</b> reference <b>memory</b> task (8 massed acquisition trials) with a 24 hour follow-up probe trial to assess memory retention showed no differences in acquisition performance but were impaired on the 24 hour retention of the platform location. In contrast, the performance of rats tested in a <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> task (delayed matching to position task) was not impaired. Therefore, sleepiness induced by SI effectively impairs the recall of <b>spatial</b> reference <b>memories</b> but does not impair <b>spatial</b> reference <b>memory</b> acquisition or <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> in Fischer-Norway rats...|$|R

40|$|Our {{ability to}} {{remember}} locations in space (<b>spatial</b> working <b>memory)</b> and {{our ability to}} direct attention to those locations (spatial attention) are two fundamental and closely related cognitive processes. A growing body of behavioural evidence suggests that <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> and <b>spatial</b> attention share common resources, while neuroimaging studies show some overlap in the neural regions that mediate these two cognitive functions. The current study used fMRI to directly examine {{the extent to which}} <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> and <b>spatial</b> attention rely on common underlying neural mechanisms. Twenty healthy participants underwent functional MRI while performing a dual task of <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> incorporating a visual search task during the working memory retention interval. Working memory and visual search task loads were parametrically modulated. A wide network of prefrontal, premotor, and parietal regions showed increasing activity with increased <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> load. Of these areas, part of the right supramarginal gyrus, lying along the intraparietal sulcus, showed a significant interaction such that the neural activity associated with <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> load was significantly attenuated as visual search load in the dual task was increased. This interaction suggests that this part of the supramarginal gyrus, along the intraparietal sulcus, is critical for mediating both <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> and shifts in spatial attention.

5|$|The pallium is a {{layer of}} gray matter that lies {{on the surface of}} the {{forebrain}} and is the most complex and most recent evolutionary development of the brain as an organ. In reptiles and mammals, it is called the cerebral cortex. Multiple functions involve the pallium, including smell and <b>spatial</b> <b>memory.</b> In mammals, where it becomes so large as to dominate the brain, it takes over functions from many other brain areas. In many mammals, the cerebral cortex consists of folded bulges called gyri that create deep furrows or fissures called sulci. The folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and the amount of information that can be stored and processed.|$|E
25|$|In {{cognitive}} psychology and neuroscience, <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> {{is the part}} of memory responsible for recording information about one's environment and spatial orientation. For example, a person's <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> is required in order to navigate around a familiar city, just as a rat's <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> is needed to learn the location of food {{at the end of a}} maze. It is often argued that in both humans and animals, spatial memories are summarized as a cognitive map. <b>Spatial</b> <b>memory</b> has representations within working, short-term memory and long-term memory. Research indicates that there are specific areas of the brain associated with <b>spatial</b> <b>memory.</b> Many methods are used for measuring <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> in children, adults, and animals.|$|E
25|$|Thus, the {{evidence}} for the <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> of some species of animals, such as rats, indicates that they do use <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> to locate and retrieve hidden food stores.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> is {{the ability}} to {{temporarily}} store visual-spatial memories under attentional control, in order to complete a task. This cognitive ability mediates individual differences in the capacity for higher level spatial abilities, such as mental rotation. <b>Spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> involves storing large amounts of short-term <b>spatial</b> <b>memories</b> in relation to visuo-spatial sketchpad.It is used in the temporary storage and manipulation of visual-spatial information such as memorizing shapes, colours, location or motion of objects in space. It is also involved in tasks which consist of planning of spatial movements, like planning one's route through a complex building. The visuospatial sketchpad can be split into separate visual, spatial and possibly kin-aesthetic (movement) components. Its neurobiological function also correlates within the right hemisphere of the brain.|$|R
40|$|SummaryMemories {{enhance the}} {{efficiency}} with which animals can exploit their resources. They {{make it easier}} for an animal to return to places and things that are useful, and to avoid those that may be dangerous or costly. <b>Spatial</b> <b>memories</b> — those that encode relationships between features in an environment or an individual's path through the environment — help an animal to exploit multiple locations. They make it possible for an animal to forage in surrounding areas while maintaining a home, and they can allow animals to travel rapidly between different resources. <b>Spatial</b> <b>memories</b> are thus of great ecological importance, and they make possible many of the conditions that lead to social behaviour. The use of <b>spatial</b> <b>memories</b> to guide movement towards a remembered location — navigation, broadly defined — has developed in at least three lineages from the Cambrian explosion: Molluscs, Chordates and Arthropods. We are beginning to understand how a few of these animals navigate. This primer describes some of what we have learnt about the memories that insects use in order to travel efficiently through an area. Many details of these memories will be foreign to you, as a mammal. But it is striking how much their organizing principles have in common with our own...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examined}} the effects of executive attention on <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> in adults using a location recall task. Attention is suggested to {{play a crucial role in}} maintenance of a remembered location in <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory.</b> Awh and Jonides (2001) found that reaction times to a presented stimulus were faster when the stimulus was held in <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory.</b> A subsequent study found that when holding a location in <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory,</b> tasks which shift attention cause memory performance to be worse for the remembered location. An ERP study by Awh and Jonides (2001) found similar response amplitudes between visual responses for memorized locations and directed spatial attention. These results are significant because they suggest that spatial attention is used as a rehearsal mechanism for holding locations in <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory.</b> Another study found that when a location is held in <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory,</b> an onset of an external stimulus, i. e., a distractor, caused a shift in the memory representation in the direction of the location (Stigchel, Merten, Meeter, 2 ̆ 6 Theeuwes, 2007). In contrast Schutte, Keiser, and Beatte (2015) found that in a similar task 6 -year-olds’ memory representation of the target location shifted away from the distractor...|$|R
25|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} and sleep {{has also been}} a researched association. Sleep deprivation actually hinders memory performance improvement due to an active disruption of <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> consolidation. Therefore, <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> is enhanced by a period of sleep.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spatial</b> <b>memory</b> is a person’s {{knowledge}} of the space around them, and their whereabouts in it. It also encompasses all memories of areas and places, {{and how to get}} to and from them. <b>Spatial</b> <b>memory</b> is distinct from object memory and involves different parts of the brain. <b>Spatial</b> <b>memory</b> involves the dorsal parts of the brain and more specifically the hippocampus. However many times both types of memory are used together, such as when trying to remember where you put a lost object. A classic test of <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> is the Corsi block-tapping task, where an instructor taps a series of blocks in a random order and the participant attempts to imitate them. The amount of blocks they can tap before performance breaks down on average is called their Corsi span. <b>Spatial</b> <b>memory</b> is always being used whenever a person is moving any part of their body; therefore it is generally more vulnerable to decay than object memory is.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of tasks that psychologists use to measure <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> on adults, {{children}} and animal models. These tasks allow professionals to identify cognitive irregularities in adults and children and allows researchers to administer varying types of drugs and or lesions in participants and measure the consequential effects on <b>spatial</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{proposed}} that a common mechanism may underlie spatial attention and <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory.</b> One proposal is that <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> is maintained by attention-based rehearsal [Awh, E., Jonides, J., & Reuter-Lorenz, P. A. (1998). Rehearsal in <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory.</b> Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 24 (3), 780 - 790], and so a spatial attention shift during the retention interval of a spatial location should impair its memory performance. In the present study, participants engaged in single-item, parallel or serial search tasks while remembering a <b>spatial</b> location. Although <b>memory</b> tended to bias all searches, {{the need for an}} attentional shift during the retention interval impaired memory performance only in single-item search, but not in other searches. These findings suggest that previous evidence for the attention-based rehearsal account does not generalize to visual search.

40|$|Directed {{actions can}} play a causal role in cognition, shaping thought processes. What drives this {{cross-talk}} between action and thought? I investigated the hypothesis that representations in <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> mediate interactions between directed actions and problem solving. Participants attempted to solve an insight problem while occasionally either moving their eyes in a pattern embodying the problem’s solution or maintaining fixation. They simultaneously held either a spatial or verbal stimulus in working memory. Participants who moved their eyes in a pattern that embodied the solution {{were more likely to}} solve the problem, but only while also performing a verbal working memory task. Embodied guidance of insight was eliminated when participants were instead engaged in a <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> task while moving their eyes, implying that loading <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> prevented movement representations from influencing problem solving. These results point to <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> as a mechanism driving embodied guidance of insight, suggesting that actions do not automat-ically influence problem solving. Instead, cross-talk between action and higher order cognition requires representations in <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory...</b>|$|R
25|$|Hemisphere {{specialization}} {{is found}} in this brain region.

25|$|Interestingly, {{increased}} adult hippocampal place cell neurogenesis {{does not}} necessarily lead to better performance on <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> tasks. Just as too little neurogenesis leads to <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> deficits, so too does too much neurogenesis.

25|$|Varying {{vestibular}} system stimulation has {{an effect}} on place cells. The vestibular system, part of the labyrinth of the inner ear, {{plays an important role in}} <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> by tuning into self-motion such as acceleration. Bilateral lesions of the vestibular system in patients cause abnormal firing of hippocampal place cells as evidenced, in part, by difficulties with aforementioned spatial tasks such as the radial arm maze and the Morris water navigation task. The dysfunction in <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> seen with damage to the vestibular system is lasting and possibly permanent, particularly if there is bilateral damage. For example, <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> deficits of patients with chronic vestibular loss is seen 5–10 years after a complete loss of the bilateral vestibular labyrinths.|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} age-related cognitive changes in a visuomotor learning task that depends on strategic control and contrast it with the effect in a task principally depending on visuomotor recalibration. Methods. Participants performed a ball throwing task while donning either a reversing dove prism or a displacement wedge prism, which mainly depend on strategic control or visuomotor recalibration, respectively. Visuomotor performance was then analysed in relation to rule acquisition and reversal, recognition <b>memory,</b> visual <b>memory,</b> <b>spatial</b> planning, and <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> with tasks from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). Results. The results confirmed previous works showing a detrimental effect of age on visuomotor learning. The analyses of the cognitive changes observed across age showed that both strategic control and visuomotor recalibration had significant negative correlations only {{with the number of}} errors in the <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> task. However, when the effect of aging was controlled, the only significant correlation remaining was between the reversal adaptation magnitude and <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory.</b> Discussion. These results suggest that <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> decline across aging could contribute to age-dependent deterioration in both visuomotor learning processes. However, <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> integrity seems to affect strategic learning decline even after controlling for aging...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Ethanol extract of Clitorea ternatea (EECT) was {{evaluated}} in diabetes-induced cognitive decline rat model for its nootropic and neuroprotective activity. Materials and Methods: Effect on <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory,</b> <b>spatial</b> reference <b>memory</b> and <b>spatial</b> working-reference <b>memory</b> {{was evaluated}} by Y maze, Morris water maze and Radial arm maze respectively. Neuroprotective effects of EECT was studied by assaying acetylcholinesterase, lipid peroxide, superoxide dismutase (SOD), total nitric oxide (NO), catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) {{levels in the}} brain of diabetic rats. Results: The EECT (200 and 400 mg/kg) was found to cause significant increase in <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> (P < 0. 05), <b>spatial</b> reference <b>memory</b> (P < 0. 001) and spatial working-reference (P < 0. 001) in retention trials on Y maze, Morris water maze and Radial arm maze respectively. Whereas significant decrease in acetylcholinesterase activity (P < 0. 05), lipid peroxide (P < 0. 001), total NO (P < 0. 001) and significant increase in SOD, CAT and GSH levels was observed in animals treated with EECT (200 and 400 mg/kg) compared to diabetic control group.

40|$|Environmental {{enrichment}} (EE) {{is known}} to enhance learning and memory. Declarative memories are thought to undergo a first rapid and local consolidation process, followed by a prolonged process of system consolidation, which consist in a time-dependent gradual reorganization of brain regions supporting remote memory storage and crucial {{for the formation of}} enduring memories. At present, it is not known whether EE can affect the process of declarative memory system consolidation. We characterized the time course of hippocampal and cortical activation following recall of progressively more remote <b>spatial</b> <b>memories.</b> Wild-type mice either exposed to EE for 40 days or left in standard environment were subjected to spatial learning in the Morris water maze and to the probe test 1, 10, 20, 30, and 50 days after learning. Following the probe test, regional expression of the inducible immediate early gene c-Fos was mapped by immunohistochemistry, as an indicator of neuronal activity. We found that activation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), suggested to have a privileged role in processing remote <b>spatial</b> <b>memories,</b> was evident at shorter time intervals after learning in EE mice; in addition, EE induced the progressive activation of a distributed cortical network not activated in non-EE mice. This suggests that EE not only accelerates the process of mPFC recruitment but also recruits additional cortical areas into the network supporting remote <b>spatial</b> <b>memories...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{hippocampus}} provides {{animals with}} a spatial map of their environment. It stores information regarding non-egocentric space (egocentric means {{in reference to}} one's body position in space) and therefore supports viewpoint independence in <b>spatial</b> <b>memory.</b> This means that it allows for viewpoint manipulation from memory. It is however, important for long-term <b>spatial</b> <b>memory</b> of allocentric space (reference to external cues in space).

Here, we tested the ability of LY 354740 to rescue <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> performance in mice that lack the GluA 1 subunit of the AMPA glutamate receptor, encoded by Gria 1, a gene recently implicated in schizophrenia by genome-wide association studies. We found that LY 354740 failed to rescue the <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> deficit in Gria 1 (-/-) mice during rewarded alternation performance in the T-maze. In contrast, LY 354740 did reduce the locomotor hyperactivity in these animals to a level that was similar to controls. A similar pattern was found with the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol, with no amelioration of the <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> deficit in Gria 1 (-/-) mice, even though the same dose of haloperidol reduced their locomotor hyperactivity. These results with LY 354740 contrast with the rescue of <b>spatial</b> working <b>memory</b> in models of glutamatergic hypofunction using non-competitive NMDAR antagonists.
