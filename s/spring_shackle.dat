50|$|Oilite is a porous bronze or {{iron alloy}} {{commonly}} impregnated with an oil lubricant {{and used in}} bearings. The original Oilite and Oilite Plus are bronze alloys, while Super Oilite and Super Oilite 16 are iron-based. Oilite was developed by Chrysler in 1930, originally for use in bearings for water pumps and <b>spring</b> <b>shackles,</b> and without oil as the porous filter element in gasoline filters. Chrysler sold approximately 500,000 Oilite bearings in 1930 and approximately 2.5 million the next year. The Super Oilite was introduced in 1932. Overall sales of all Oilite material in 1932 was seven million; this rose to 18 million in 1933. Oilite was a profit center for Chrysler during this time. Currently, the Oilite trademark belongs to Beemer Precision.|$|R
5000|$|PD1A: This {{version was}} {{introduced}} in Autumn 1946. The only difference between this and the standard PD1, was that rubber bushes sourced from Metalastic Ltd were used in place of copper bushes in the <b>spring</b> <b>shackles.</b> It seems this produced a more stable bus, notably Barton Transport had an initial tilt-test failure when they, in 1957, first re-fitted a 7 ft 6 in wide Tiger PS1/1 Chassis with an 8 ft wide double deck body, but fitting PD1A style spring bushes cured the problem from early 1947 the PD1A had supplanted the PD1 in production. This variant, like the PD1, sold generally across the UK. Barton, for instance, took PD1s in 1946 and PD1As in 1947, all with bespoke forward-entrance lowbridge bodies, by Duple. A number of PD1As had standard Leyland outline bodies, licence-built by Walter Alexander Coachbuilders. Two of these were supplied in completely knocked down (CKD) form for the Londonderry & Lough Swilly Railway Company who had them assembled in Derry. These were {{the first of many}} CKD Alexander bodies, construction of such, later, becoming a speciality. The SMT group also took Leyland-style Alexander bodies and the British Transport Commission had examples with Eastern Coach Works bodies of similar appearance to those on their standard Bristol K series double-deckers; in addition Bristol Tramways and Carriage Company had similar bodies built by its own Brislington Body Works and local private-sector coachbuilder Longwell Green Coachworks.|$|R
50|$|This car now has {{the same}} Rover {{patented}} carburettor as their 8 hp car. The change speed lever is now in an exterior quadrant near the driver's right hand instead of beneath the steering wheel. The universal joint to the propellor shaft has been redesigned and the propellor shaft's casing now acts as a torque rod. The brake {{on the back of}} the gearbox which is controlled by the clutch is now very much larger. There are now separate levers for throttle and ignition timing. The front <b>springs</b> now have <b>shackle</b> pins. A fan has been added to the engine cooling system. Petrol is now carried on the dashboard. There is a pawl below the brake pedal so it can be used to brake the car on a slope.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{most radical}} feature {{of his car}} was the novel {{suspension}} of its six-cylinder engine so as to cut down vibration. The engine was supported on three points and rested on rubber mounts. Noise and vibration were much less. There was {{still a lot of}} movement of the engine when idling, but under a load it settled down. Although it was a great success in the Plymouth, Henry Ford did not like it. For no given reason, he just didn't like it, and that was that. I told Walter that I felt it was {{a step in the right}} direction, that it would smooth out all noises and would adapt itself to axles and springs and steering-gear mounts, which would stop the transfer of road noises into the body. Today rubber mounts are used on all cars. They are also found on electric-motor mounts, in refrigerators, radios, television sets—wherever mechanical noises are apparent, rubber is used to eliminate them. We can thank Walter Chrysler for a quieter way of life. Mr. Ford could have installed this new mount at once in the V&#8209;8, but he missed the value of it. Later Edsel and I persuaded him. Rubber mounts are now found also in doors, hinges, windshields, fenders, <b>spring</b> hangers, <b>shackles,</b> and lamps—all with the idea of eliminating squeaks and rattles." ...|$|R
50|$|This 7-seater {{limousine}} {{has four}} good doors and six side windows. Front seat is fixed as is unfortunately the windscreen but {{the screen is}} large and gives a good view. The back seat has three armrests. The occasional seats fold away neatly, give enough support to the back and knee and toe room is well arranged. Equipment includes such fittings as: two interior lights, five blinds, parcel net and ventilator in the roof, bag pockets on the doors. Upholstery in the rear is cord and in front is leather. There is a large cupboard {{to the left of}} the instruments. An amplifying telephone (to the driver) is provided. The gear lever has a catch for reverse and a quiet-second together with syncro-mesh is provided. There are just the four brakes which are applied by rods and cables by hand lever or by pedal. The half-elliptical <b>springs</b> have Silentbloc <b>shackle</b> bushes and zinc interleaves and are damped by hydraulic shock absorbers. Price £575.|$|R
6000|$|The {{swarm of}} renegades--dock-masters, berthing-masters, gatemen, and such like--appear to nurse an immense {{distrust}} of the captive ship's resignation. There never seem chains and ropes enough to satisfy their minds concerned with the safe binding of free ships to the strong, muddy, enslaved earth. [...] "You had better put another bight of a hawser astern, Mr. Mate," [...] is the usual phrase in their mouth. I brand them for renegades, because {{most of them have}} been sailors in their time. As if the infirmities of old age--the gray hair, the wrinkles at the corners of the eyes, and the knotted veins of the hands--were the symptoms of moral poison, they prowl about the quays with an underhand air of gloating over the broken spirit of noble captives. They want more fenders, more breasting- ropes; they want more <b>springs,</b> more <b>shackles,</b> more fetters; they want to make ships with volatile souls as motionless as square blocks of stone. They stand on the mud of pavements, these degraded sea-dogs, with long lines of railway-trucks clanking their couplings behind their backs, and run malevolent glances over your ship from headgear to taffrail, only wishing to tyrannize over the poor creature under the hypocritical cloak of benevolence and care. Here and there cargo cranes looking like instruments of torture for ships swing cruel hooks at the end of long chains. Gangs of dock- labourers swarm with muddy feet over the gangways. It is a moving sight this, of so many men of the earth, earthy, who never cared anything for a ship, trampling unconcerned, brutal and hob-nailed upon her helpless body.|$|R
