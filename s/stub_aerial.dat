50|$|Commencing with a cameo {{appearance}} in the Doctor Who serial The Five Doctors (1983), Mark III Dalek variants seen during this decade feature a neck bin raised so that a strip of it is visible between the lower neck ring {{and the top of}} the shoulders. The fitting of a small <b>stub</b> <b>aerial</b> to the dome continued, appearing for the last time in Resurrection of the Daleks (1984).|$|E
50|$|In Destiny of the Daleks (1979) {{many of the}} Dalek props feature an {{attachment}} resembling a small <b>stub</b> <b>aerial</b> projecting {{from the top of}} the dome. Six crude, hollow, vacuum-formed Dalek props were also created. They were primarily used during location filming of the serial's finale, although several of them can also be seen in the background of some studio shots. They can be recognised by their thick neck struts and the absence of dome aerials and appendage ball joints. Production photographs taken at the time reveal that they also lacked hemispheres on the rear skirt panels.|$|E
