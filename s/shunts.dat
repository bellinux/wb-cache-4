5|$|Shunt {{surgery was}} {{introduced}} in 1949; initially, ventriculoperitoneal <b>shunts</b> were used. In 1971, good results were reported with lumboperitoneal shunting. Negative reports on shunting in the 1980s led to a brief period (1988–1993) during which optic nerve fenestration (which had initially been described in an unrelated condition in 1871) was more popular. Since then, shunting is recommended predominantly, with occasional exceptions.|$|E
5|$|Shunt surgery, usually {{performed}} by neurosurgeons, involves {{the creation of}} a conduit by which CSF can be drained into another body cavity. The initial procedure is usually a lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt, which connects the subarachnoid space in the lumbar spine with the peritoneal cavity. Generally, a pressure valve is included in the circuit to avoid excessive drainage when the patient is erect. LP shunting provides long-term relief in about half the cases; others require revision of the shunt, often on more than one occasion—usually due to shunt obstruction. If the lumboperitoneal shunt needs repeated revisions, a ventriculoatrial or ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be considered. These <b>shunts</b> are inserted in one of the lateral ventricles of the brain, usually by stereotactic surgery, and then connected either to the right atrium of the heart or the peritoneal cavity, respectively. Given the reduced need for revisions in ventricular <b>shunts,</b> it is possible that this procedure will become the first-line type of shunt treatment.|$|E
50|$|Because the <b>shunt</b> {{systems are}} too {{expensive}} for most people in developing countries, such people often die without getting a <b>shunt.</b> Worse, the rate of revision in <b>shunt</b> systems adds {{to the cost of}} <b>shunting</b> many times. Looking at this point, a study compares <b>shunt</b> systems and highlights the role of low-cost <b>shunt</b> systems in most of the developing countries. It compares the Chhabra <b>shunt</b> system to <b>shunt</b> systems from developed countries.|$|R
30|$|Five {{patients}} (71 %) {{were presented}} with <b>shunt</b> failure due to tube migration (one of them had wound and <b>shunt</b> infection), while two patients (29 %) presented with <b>shunt</b> failure due to <b>shunt</b> obstruction with proper <b>shunt</b> position.|$|R
50|$|A <b>shunt</b> turn {{is where}} a <b>shunting</b> {{locomotive}} is allocated to <b>shunting</b> a yard or set of sidings. Some <b>shunt</b> turns required 'trip' working between yards or sidings.|$|R
25|$|In a {{minority}} of people with advanced cirrhosis that have recurrent ascites, <b>shunts</b> may be used. Typical <b>shunts</b> used are portacaval shunt, peritoneovenous shunt, and the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). However, none of these <b>shunts</b> {{has been shown to}} extend life expectancy, and are considered to be bridges to liver transplantation.|$|E
25|$|The {{intrahepatic}} <b>shunts</b> {{found in}} large dog breeds are passed on {{in a simple}} autosomal recessive way, while the extrahepatic <b>shunts</b> of the small breeds are inherited on a polygenic basis.|$|E
25|$|Congenital PSS is a {{hereditary}} {{condition in}} dogs and cats, its frequency varying {{depending on the}} breed. The <b>shunts</b> found mainly in small dog breeds such as Shih Tzus, Tibetan Spaniels, Miniature Schnauzers and Yorkshire Terriers, and in cats such as Persians, British Shorthairs, Himalayans, and mixed breeds are usually extrahepatic (outside the liver), while the <b>shunts</b> found in large dog breeds such as Irish Wolfhounds and Labrador Retrievers tend to be intrahepatic (inside the liver).|$|E
5000|$|A <b>shunting</b> sign (入換標識, irekae hyōshiki or—more briefly—入標, irehyō) {{is not a}} signal; therefore, its {{diagonal}} indicator is not [...] "go" [...] but [...] "open" [...] (開通, kaitsū). A <b>shunting</b> sign {{does not}} have a protected section. A <b>shunting</b> signal is absolute, but a <b>shunting</b> sign is a permissive. A train may pass a <b>shunting</b> sign reading [...] "stop" [...] only if the train is accompanied by a <b>shunting</b> staff; its locomotive displays a <b>shunting</b> car sign (入換動力車標識, irekae douryokusha hyōshiki)—a single red light at both ends—at night. In some systems, shunting-signal identification signs are omitted; instead, a <b>shunting</b> sign uses purple (instead of white) lights in a <b>shunting</b> signal.|$|R
50|$|Treatment of a CSF <b>shunt</b> {{infection}} generally includes {{removal of}} the <b>shunt</b> and placement of a temporary ventricular reservoir until the infection is resolved. There are four main methods of treating ventriculoperitoneal (VP) <b>shunt</b> infections: (1) antibiotics; (2) removal of infected <b>shunt</b> with immediate replacement; (3) externalization of <b>shunt</b> with eventual replacement; (4) removal of infected <b>shunt</b> with external ventricular drain (EVD) placement and eventual <b>shunt</b> re-insertion. The last method is best with over 95% success rate.|$|R
50|$|Management {{is focused}} on {{removing}} the infectious source. The <b>shunt</b> is removed immediately and antibiotics are begun. The infected <b>shunt,</b> typically a ventriculoatrial <b>shunt,</b> may be replaced with a ventriculoperitoneal <b>shunt.</b>|$|R

25|$|Budd-Chiari {{syndrome}} is the blockage of a hepatic vein {{or of the}} hepatic part of the inferior vena cava. This form of thrombosis presents with abdominal pain, ascites and enlarged liver. Treatment varies between therapy and surgical intervention {{by the use of}} <b>shunts.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pulmonary {{complications}} {{occur in}} up to 50% of patients. Severe lung injury and hypoxemia result in high mortality. Most cases of severe lung injury are due to ARDS, with or without sepsis. Pulmonary haemorrhage, pleural effusions, atelectasis, and intrapulmonary <b>shunts</b> also contribute to respiratory difficulty.|$|E
40|$|<b>Shunt</b> nephritis {{is a rare}} {{complication}} of a chronically infected ventriculoatrial <b>shunt.</b> A 17 year old boy is described, with arthritis in both ankles and positive rheumatoid factor tests, who presented with symptoms of <b>shunt</b> nephritis. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis. The patient recovered completely after removal of the <b>shunt</b> and antibiotic treatment. <b>Shunt</b> nephritis {{should be considered in}} patients with a ventriculoatrial <b>shunt</b> presenting with arthritis, and the arthritis may be an early indicator of an infected ventriculoatrial <b>shunt...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{operation}} of the shuttle train is quite efficient {{as it is a}} full train loaded with 80 TEUs and doesn’t need any <b>shunting</b> processes between Rotterdam and Basel. The SWL transport includes the transfer of the wagon from the hinterland terminal to the <b>shunting</b> yard, the <b>shunting</b> process within the <b>shunting</b> yard, the train from the <b>shunting</b> yard to the regional <b>shunting</b> point, the <b>shunting</b> at the regional <b>shunting</b> point and the distribution and delivery of the wagons to the final recipients’ sidings. Here the trains are comparably short (10 to 30 wagons) and the sidings are served individually wagon by wagon.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} reasons why back-contact (PUM) cells stay {{somewhat}} behind in efficiency is because of their lower <b>shunt</b> resistance. A simple method was developed to determine the <b>shunt</b> resistance of the individual process-induced <b>shunt</b> paths. These contributions have led to an electrical model describing the process-induced <b>shunt</b> paths. Individual <b>shunt</b> paths were analysed in detail. Changes in processing were introduced to eliminate the <b>shunting</b> problems. These changes resulted in the <b>shunt</b> resistances beyond 5 kcm 2 on 225 cm 2 cells with industrial processing...|$|R
25|$|For analog current ranges, matched low-resistance <b>shunts</b> are {{connected}} in parallel with the meter movement to divert most of the current around the coil. Again for {{the case of a}} hypothetical 1mA, 500ohm movement on a 1ampere range, the shunt resistance would be just over 0.5ohms.|$|E
25|$|The {{maximum output}} {{frequency}} (controlled signal) {{is limited by}} the parasitic capacitance of a RO, which originates from the electrodes formed {{on the surface of the}} photoresistor and <b>shunts</b> the output circuit. A typical value of this capacitance is tens of picofarads that practically limits the output frequency to approximately 100kHz.|$|E

40|$|Transjugular {{intrahepatic}} portosystemic <b>shunt</b> (TIPS) {{is widely}} used {{in the treatment of}} cirrhotic portal hypertension and its associated complications. However, postoperative <b>shunt</b> dysfunction has been an important factor restricting the clinical application of TIPS. This article summarizes the use of <b>shunt,</b> the incidence of <b>shunt</b> dysfunction after TIPS, preventive measures and diagnostic methods for <b>shunt</b> dysfunction, and indications and techniques of <b>shunt</b> recanalization, in order to enhance our knowledge of <b>shunt</b> dysfunction and recanalization, which could further improve the efficacy of TIPS for cirrhotic portal hypertension...|$|R
40|$|Intraoperative {{transcranial}} Doppler {{monitoring of}} cerebral ischemia during carotid clamping under general anesthesia {{was done in}} 238 carotid artery operations, mostly endarterectomy. Depending on the severity of reduction of middle cerebral artery mean velocity, patients were classified as no, mild, or severe ischemia at clamping. With a carotid <b>shunt,</b> velocity {{was always in the}} "no ischemia" category during <b>shunting.</b> For patients with no ischemia, stroke was significantly lower without a <b>shunt</b> (2 / 175 no <b>shunt</b> versus 2 / 12 <b>shunt).</b> For mild ischemia, <b>shunting</b> did not affect the stroke rate (1 / 20 no <b>shunt</b> versus 0 / 9 <b>shunt).</b> For severe ischemia, strokes were less frequent with a <b>shunt</b> (4 / 9 no <b>shunt</b> versus 0 / 13 <b>shunt).</b> Intraoperative electroencephalogram predicted most, but not all severely ischemic cases. Carotid back pressure correlated with Doppler velocity, but transcranial Doppler was more helpful. Transcranial Doppler is a new and valuable technique in carotid surgery...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of dissipating mechanical energy with piezoelectric material <b>shunted</b> with passive electrical circuits is investigated. The effective mechanical impedance for the piezoelectric element <b>shunted</b> by an arbitrary circuit is derived. The <b>shunted</b> piezoelectric {{is shown to}} possess frequency dependent stiffness and loss factor which are also dependent on the <b>shunting</b> circuit. The generally <b>shunted</b> model is specialized for two <b>shunting</b> circuits: {{the case of a}} resistor alone and that of a resistor and inductor. For resistive <b>shunting,</b> the material properties exhibit frequency dependence similar to viscoelastic materials, but are much stiffer and more independent of temperature. <b>Shunting</b> with a resistor and inductor introduces an electrical resonance, which can be optimally tuned to structural resonances in a manner analogous to a mechanical vibration arsorber. Techniques for analyzing systems which incorporate these <b>shunting</b> cases are presented and applied to a cantilevered beam experiment. The experimental results for both the resistive and resonant <b>shunting</b> circuits validate the <b>shunted</b> piezoelectric damping models...|$|R

From 31 March 2015, 86101 <b>shunts</b> the empty sleeper coaching stock into London Euston alongside 87002.

25|$|Inhaled {{nitric oxide}} is {{contraindicated}} {{in the treatment}} of neonates known to be dependent on right-to-left shunting of blood. This is as the nitric oxide decreases the pulmonary circulation's resistance by dilating pulmonary blood vessels. The increased pulmonary return increases pressure in the left atrium, causing closure of the foramen ovale and reducing the blood flow through the ductus arteriosus. Closing these <b>shunts</b> can kill neonates with heart malformations that rely on the right-to-left shunting of blood.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{moving coil}} meter is {{suitable}} only for direct current measurements, {{usually in the}} range of 10 microamperes to 100mA. It is easily adapted to read heavier currents by using <b>shunts</b> (resistances in parallel with the basic movement) or to read voltage using series resistances known as multipliers. To read alternating currents or voltages, a rectifier is needed. One of the earliest suitable rectifiers was the copper oxide rectifier developed and manufactured by Union Switch & Signal Company, Swissvale, Pennsylvania, later part of Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company, from 1927.|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{possible}} complications include <b>shunt</b> malfunction, <b>shunt</b> failure, and <b>shunt</b> infection, along with {{infection of the}} <b>shunt</b> tract following surgery (the most common reason for <b>shunt</b> failure is infection of the <b>shunt</b> tract). Although a <b>shunt</b> generally works well, it may stop working if it disconnects, becomes blocked (clogged), infected, or it is outgrown. If this happens the cerebrospinal fluid will begin to accumulate again {{and a number of}} physical symptoms will develop (headaches, nausea, vomiting, photophobia/light sensitivity), some extremely serious, like seizures. The <b>shunt</b> failure rate is also relatively high (of the 40,000 surgeries performed annually to treat hydrocephalus, only 30% are a patient's first surgery) and {{it is not uncommon for}} patients to have multiple <b>shunt</b> revisions within their lifetime.|$|R
40|$|The ventriculo-gallbladder (VGB) <b>shunt</b> is {{employed}} rarely {{as an alternative}} to the ventriculoperitoneal (VP) <b>shunt.</b> The VGB <b>shunt</b> is primarily used in place of the VP <b>shunt</b> when complications such as peritoneal infection, <b>shunt</b> contamination, <b>shunt</b> obstruction, or surgical adhesions limit the effectiveness of the VP <b>shunt,</b> or when contraindications to alternative forms of ventricular drainage exist. Retained foreign body in the common bile duct is another rare entity. Therefore, a retained distal portion of a remotely removed VGB <b>shunt</b> is an extremely rare finding. Here, we report the case of a retained metallic fragment of a VGB <b>shunt</b> leading to the formation of an obstructive bile calculus discovered in the common bile duct of a young woman presenting with cholangitis.

The Palmerston North to Woodville section of the PNGL is also utilised for two daily trains between Palmerston North and Pahiatua in the northern Wairarapa, and two <b>shunts</b> operate between Napier and Hastings, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} {{structure is}} painted black to equalize temperature by radiative heat transfer. Overall, the spacecraft is thoroughly blanketed to retain heat. Unlike the Pioneers and Voyagers, the radio dish is also enclosed in blankets that {{extend to the}} body. The heat from the RTG adds warmth to the spacecraft while {{it is in the}} outer Solar System. While in the inner Solar System, the spacecraft must prevent overheating, hence electronic activity is limited, power is diverted to <b>shunts</b> with attached radiators, and louvers are opened to radiate excess heat. While the spacecraft is cruising inactively in the cold outer Solar System, the louvers are closed, and the shunt regulator reroutes power to electric heaters.|$|E
25|$|Motivated by his {{personal}} experience with the disease, Ommaya focused {{on the problem of}} transplantation of islet cells for the treatment of diabetes. A major challenge facing survival of islet cells is immune rejection. Ommaya thought that the CSF would provide an ideal setting for transplanted islets due to the immune protection provided by the blood-brain barrier. He developed an artificial organ which would house transplanted islets, and the cells could be nourished by the CSF. Ayub, Illani Atwater, and colleagues identified that ventricular-peritoneal CSF <b>shunts</b> provided an immune protected site for the transplantation of mouse and rat islets in dogs and llamas. Ayub and colleagues also identified that CSF glucose mirrors blood glucose. Islets cells were able to survive in this system and function in the llama model, but further work on the model is needed.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Inadequate {{pulmonary}} {{blood flow}} through a right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery (RV-PA) <b>shunt</b> early after the Norwood operation can be remedied {{by adding a}} modified Blalock-Taussig (mBT) <b>shunt.</b> We used multiscale computational modeling {{to determine whether the}} stenotic RV-PA <b>shunt</b> should be left in situ or removed. METHODS: Models of the Norwood circulation were constructed with (1) a 5 -mm RV-PA <b>shunt,</b> (2) a RV-PA <b>shunt</b> with 3 - or 2 -mm stenosis at the RV anastomosis, (3) a stenotic RV-PA <b>shunt</b> plus a 3. 0 - or 3. 5 -mm mBT <b>shunt,</b> or (4) a 3. 5 -mm mBT <b>shunt.</b> A hydraulic network that mathematically describes an entire circulatory system with pre-stage 2 hemodynamics was used to predict local dynamics within the Norwood circulation. Global variables including total cardiac output, mixed venous oxygen saturation, stroke work, and systemic oxygen delivery can be computed. RESULTS: Proximal stenosis of the RV-PA <b>shunt</b> results in decreased pulmonary blood flow, total cardiac output, mixed venous saturation, and oxygen delivery. Addition of a 3. 0 - or 3. 5 -mm mBT <b>shunt</b> leads to pulmonary overcirculation, lowers systemic oxygen delivery, and decreases coronary perfusion pressure. Diastolic runoff through the stenotic RV-PA <b>shunt</b> dramatically increases retrograde flow into the single ventricle. Removal of the stenotic RV-PA <b>shunt</b> balances systemic and pulmonary blood flow, eliminates regurgitant flow into the single ventricle, and improves systemic oxygen delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Adding a mBT <b>shunt</b> to remedy a stenotic RV-PA <b>shunt</b> early after a Norwood operation can lead to pulmonary overcirculation and may decrease systemic oxygen delivery. The stenotic RV-PA <b>shunt</b> should be taken down. Conversion to an optimal mBT <b>shunt</b> is preferable to augmenting a stenotic RV-PA <b>shunt</b> with a smaller mBT <b>shunt...</b>|$|R
