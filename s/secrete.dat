40|$|Immunoglobulin <b>secreting</b> {{cells were}} quantitated in the {{bronchial}} lavage fluids of 12 normal volunteers and compared with immunoglobulin <b>secreting</b> cells in peripheral blood, by a reverse hemolytic plaque assay. The {{mean number of}} cells <b>secreting</b> immunoglobulin (Ig) G in bronchial lavage fluids was 489 per million lymphocytes vs. a mean of 175 IgG <b>secreting</b> cells per million lymphocytes in peripheral blood (P < 0. 02). The mean number of IgA <b>secreting</b> cells in bronchial lavage fluids was 633 per million lymphocytes as compared to 100 per million lymphocytes in peripheral blood (P < 0. 005). Thus, compared to peripheral blood, cells from the lavage fluids were relatively enriched for both IgG and IgA <b>secreting</b> cells. However, IgA <b>secreting</b> cells were the major class of immunoglobulin <b>secreting</b> cells in bronchial lavage fluids, whereas IgG <b>secreting</b> cells predominated in peripheral blood. The prominence of IgA <b>secreting</b> cells in bronchial lavage fluids was further demonstrated by a mean ratio of IgA/IgG <b>secreting</b> cells in bronchial lavage fluids of 1. 26 compared to a ratio in peripheral blood of 0. 57 (P < 0. 02). Cells <b>secreting</b> IgM were identified in only four of seven bronchial lavage fluid samples studied but in all peripheral blood samples. IgE <b>secreting</b> cells were not present in normal peripheral blood but could be demonstrated in 5 of 11 lavage fluid specimens. Thus, cells actively <b>secreting</b> immunoglobulins can be identified in the lower bronchial-alveolar tree of normal human subjects. Cells <b>secreting</b> IgG, IgA, or IgM may function in local lung defenses against infection; cells <b>secreting</b> IgE may contribute to hypersensitivity reactions in the lung...|$|R

The development of cells <b>secreting</b> anti-peroxidase antibody (Ab) and cells <b>secreting</b> immunoglobulins (Ig) were {{detected in the}} draining popliteal lymph nodes in the subsequent 35 days, using local haemolysis plaque assay with sheep red cell blood cells coated with either PO or anti-mouse Ig antibody. Plaque-forming cells (PFC) were isolated from the centre of plaques by micromanipulation and after appropriate treatment, were examined by electron microscopy for their intracellular Ab content and in corporation of [3 H]-thymidine. Four subpopulations of Ig <b>secreting</b> cells were distinguished: (1) cells <b>secreting</b> Ig without Ab function and not containing intracellular Ab detectable between days 5 and 20; (2) cells <b>secreting</b> Ig without Ab function but containing Ab appearing on day 6 and present throughout the immune response; (3) cells <b>secreting</b> Ab and containing Ab; (4) cells <b>secreting</b> Ab, but without detectable intracellular Ab.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of appearance}} of cells <b>secreting</b> IgG rheumatoid factor (IgG RF) {{has been studied}} in MRL/l mice {{by means of the}} ELISPOT assay, a new immunoenzyme procedure. Mice of the MRL/l strain spontaneously develop an autoimmune disease associated with arthritic manifestations.

Peak frequencies of IgG RF <b>secreting</b> cells amounting to almost 10 % {{of the total number of}} IgG <b>secreting</b> cells were observed at later stages.

40|$|The {{action of}} <b>secreted</b> phospholipases A 2 in skin {{is thought to}} be {{essential}} for epidermal barrier homeostasis. The incomplete knowledge of presence and functions of the novel <b>secreted</b> phospholipase A 2 subtypes in skin prompted us to explore their expression in epidermis and primary keratinocytes from murine neonatal skin. We detected <b>secreted</b> phospholipases A 2 -IB, -IIA, -IIC, -IID, -IIE, -IIF, -V, -X, and -XII. To study <b>secreted</b> phospholipase A 2 expression during epidermal differentiation, primary keratinocytes from the basal, suprabasal, and upper differentiated layers of neonatal mouse epidermis were obtained by density gradient centrifugation. mRNA for <b>secreted</b> phospholipases A 2 -IB, -IIE, -IIF, -V, and -XII- 1 are mainly expressed in the upper differentiated layers, whereas the most prominent enzymes in the basal and suprabasal layers are <b>secreted</b> phospholipases A 2 -IIA, -IID, and -X.

Duodenal ulcers were all associated with extensive acid <b>secreting</b> areas. The gastric acid outputs in the basal state and after maximal stimulation with gastrin were highest in duodenal ulcers, and lowest in gastric ulcers without extensive acid <b>secreting</b> areas.

Cimetidine also significantly diminished the recurrence of duodenal ulcers, but not gastric ulcers with and without extensive acid <b>secreting</b> areas.
