25|$|In a twist, Gene Hunt in 1973 {{turns out}} to be {{astronaut}} 'Major Tom' Tyler — Sam's father — in the conclusion.

However the final shot shows, not an astronaut boot, but Gene Hunt's signature white loafer taking the first <b>step</b> <b>onto</b> the martian surface, casting doubt once again onto the ending.|$|E

25|$|Surratt and {{the others}} stood on the drop for about 10 seconds, and then Captain Rath clapped his hands. Four {{soldiers}} of Company F of the 14th Veteran Reserves knocked out the supports holding the drops in place, and the condemned fell. Surratt, who had moved forward enough to barely <b>step</b> <b>onto</b> the drop, lurched forward and slid partway down the drop, her body snapping tight {{at the end of}} the rope, swinging back and forth. Surratt's death appeared to be the easiest. Atzerodt's stomach heaved once and his legs quivered; then, he was still. Herold and Powell struggled for nearly five minutes, strangling to death.|$|E
500|$|Apollo 11 was the spaceflight {{that landed}} {{the first two}} humans on the Moon.

Armstrong became the first to <b>step</b> <b>onto</b> the lunar surface six hours after landing on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. They spent {{about two and a}} quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected [...] of lunar material to bring back to Earth. Michael Collins piloted the command module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface.

500|$|... "Amber 31422" [...] was {{watched by}} an {{estimated}} 4.97 million viewers in the United States. The episode had a season low rating of 1.8/5 among viewers 18–49, which was down 10% {{from the previous}} episode that aired on October 14. Between Fringe and its lead-in show Bones, Fox finished in third place for the night. The Fringe episode's low ratings have been attributed by critics to the unexpected end to the 2010 World Series, which caused Fringe to air a week earlier than expected. Den of Geek columnist Billy Grifter attributed the low ratings to the parallel universe focus, commenting [...] "if you weren't a fan beforehand, you'll {{not be able to}} follow what's going on now. For those of us that did <b>step</b> <b>onto</b> the Fringe elevator early, it's a great ride, but I can see that it's a difficult proposition to attract new viewers." [...] Time shifted viewing increased the episode's ratings by 44 percent among adults, resulting in a rise from 1.8 to 2.6.|$|E
500|$|In 1637 {{fully-fledged}} opera came to Venice {{with the}} opening of the Teatro San Cassiano. Sponsored by the wealthy Tron family, this theatre was the first in the world specifically devoted to opera. The theatre's inaugural performance, on 6 March 1637, was L'Andromeda by Francesco Manelli and Benedetto Ferrari. This work was received with great enthusiasm, as was the same pair's La Maga fulminata the following year. In rapid succession three more opera houses opened in the city, as the ruling families of the Republic sought to express their wealth and status by investing in the new musical fashion. At first, Monteverdi remained aloof from these activities, perhaps on account of his age (he was over 70), or perhaps through the dignity of his office as maestro di capella at St. Mark's. Nevertheless, an unidentified contemporary, commenting on Monteverdi's silence, opined that the maestro might yet produce an opera for Venice: [...] "God willing, one of these nights he too will <b>step</b> <b>onto</b> the stage." [...] This remark proved prescient; Monteverdi's first public contribution to Venetian opera came in the 1639–40 carnival season, a revival of his L'Arianna at the Teatro San Moisè.|$|E

2500|$|Ministers {{complained about}} a [...] "sick-note culture" [...] that allowed people to drift onto Incapacity Benefit. A medical {{certificate}} from a GP {{is the first}} <b>step</b> <b>onto</b> sickness benefits; although a government-run eligibility test was brought in alongside Incapacity Benefit in 1995, critics said that officials still accepted too many claims using information supplied by the claimants themselves and their GPs without asking for an All Work Test to be performed, partly because the pool of medical assessors was relatively small and partly because doctors' time was costly - which was why large numbers of nurses were brought in to perform the new test introduced in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|In the Cornish {{examples}} {{the motive}} power {{was provided by}} waterwheels, {{or one of the}} mine's steam engines. The steam engine or water wheel would be linked to a series of beams – known as [...] "rods" [...] – [...] fastened together and reaching {{to the bottom of the}} mineshaft. [...] These were arranged to offer a reciprocating motion of, typically, twelve to fifteen feet (three to five metres). Small foot platforms were attached to the rods at the same distance apart as the engine stroke and fixed platforms were built onto the shaft walls, spaced to coincide with the top and bottom positions of each of the moving platforms. The moving platforms were often small, typically [...] square, to make the miner stand close to the centre-line of the rod and thus keep a safe distance from the sides of the shaft. For the same reason, grab handles were fitted directly above each one. To go up or down, the miner would <b>step</b> <b>onto</b> the travelling platform and allow himself to be carried to the next fixed platform, where he would step off and wait. At the end of the next stroke the next moving platform would line up and he could <b>step</b> <b>onto</b> it and repeat the process. [...] Miners could ascend and descend at the same time: the pause at the changeover point was made long enough for two men to change places. Counterweights – large boxes filled with stones attached through [...] "see-sawing" [...] horizontal beams – were installed to avoid the full weight of the shaft and men bearing on the top linkage. In the deepest mines, which could sink to more than 350fathoms (640metres), extra counterweights were provided at regular intervals, in horizontal side galleries.|$|E
2500|$|... "Permitted" [...] is an {{installation}} piece created by Renee Samwise Green inspired by Sarah Baartman. Green created a specific viewing arrangement {{to investigate the}} European perception of the black female body as [...] "exotic", [...] "bizarre" [...] and [...] "monstrous". Viewers were prompted to <b>step</b> <b>onto</b> the installed platform which was meant to evoke a stage, where Baartman may have been exhibited. Green recreates the basic setting of Baartman's exhibition. At {{the centre of the}} platform, which there is a large image of Baartman, and wooden rulers or slats with an engraved caption by Francis Galton encouraging viewers to measure Baartman's buttocks. In the installation there is also a peephole that allows viewers to see an image of Baartman standing on a crate. According to Willis, the implication of the peephole, [...] demonstrates how ethnographic imagery of the black female form in the nineteenth century functioned as a form of pornography for Europeans present at Baartmans exhibit.|$|E
