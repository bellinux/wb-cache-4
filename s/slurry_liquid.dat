50|$|Most {{animal manure}} {{consists}} of feces. Common forms of animal manure include farmyard manure (FYM) or farm <b>slurry</b> (<b>liquid</b> manure). FYM also contains plant material (often straw), {{which has been}} used as bedding for animals and has absorbed the feces and urine. Agricultural manure in liquid form, known as slurry, is produced by more intensive livestock rearing systems where concrete or slats are used, instead of straw bedding. Manure from different animals has different qualities and requires different application rates when used as fertilizer. For example horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, chickens, turkeys, rabbits, and guano from seabirds and bats all have different properties. For instance, sheep manure is high in nitrogen and potash, while pig manure is relatively low in both. Horses mainly eat grass and a few weeds so horse manure can contain grass and weed seeds, as horses do not digest seeds the way that cattle do. Chicken litter, coming from a bird, is very concentrated in nitrogen and phosphate and is prized for both properties.|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the analytical protocols that were {{developed during the}} last two years to analyze ''spent'' THQ (tetrahydroquinoline) <b>slurry</b> <b>liquid.</b> Identification of the components of the ''spent'' THQ should help to understand the influence of the slurry medium on the methanol synthesis reaction, and on other reactions with THQ as the <b>slurry</b> <b>liquid.</b> Silica gel liquid chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to isolate and purify the major compounds in the ''spent'' <b>slurry</b> <b>liquid.</b> Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were applied to identify the major compounds. Methyl-, dimethyl-, and trimethyl-THQ were found to comprise more than 80 % of the ''spent'' liquid. The balance was various methylated indoles. A methyl group always is attached to the N atom in the ring structure.

40|$|A {{two-step process}} {{consisting}} of depolymerization and catalytic cracking without hydrogen addition {{was carried out}} to produce phenols from lignin. In the first step, lignin was depolymerized using a silica-alumina catalyst in a water/ 1 -butanol solution at 623 K for 2 h. After the reaction, lignin-derived <b>slurry</b> <b>liquid</b> was obtained in 67 C-mol% yield. From the model studies, it was considered that lignin was mainly depolymerized via hydrolysis of aryl ether bonds between lignin units. For the second step, the catalytic reaction of the 1 -butanol phase of the <b>slurry</b> <b>liquid</b> was carried out over an iron oxide catalyst using a high pressure fixed-bed flow reactor at 673 K. The catalytic reaction under high pressure steam conditions was effective for {{the suppression of the}} formation of solid products. In addition, the recovery fraction of phenols increased as the F-H 2 O/F value (the flow rate ratio of steam to the <b>slurry</b> <b>liquid)</b> increased, resulting in 17 % of phenols at F-H 2 O/F = 5 for 2 - 4 h. From the model studies and our previous results, catechol and methoxyphenol in the <b>slurry</b> <b>liquid</b> were considered to be converted into phenols, cresols and other alkyl phenols over the iron oxide catalyst.

Compared with unpromoted zinc chromite catalyst, 6 wt. % Cs-promoted catalyst shifted the product distribution from methanol to higher alcohols, even though methanol was still the major product. The effect of operating conditions was less important than the addition of promoter. However, it was observed that higher temperature favors higher alcohol synthesis, and that a higher H{sub 2 }/CO ratio leads to lower oxygenates selectivity and higher hydrocarbons selectivity.
