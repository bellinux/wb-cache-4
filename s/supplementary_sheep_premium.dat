40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experiment that {{was carried out}} in order to examine the decision making process of farmers in the Alentejo dryland region of Portugal. Cumulative Prospect Theory allows modeling the Alentejo dryland farmers' decision process, because when they decide what crops and livestock activities will produce the different results are appraised relatively to the initial wealth, which permits its appraisal in terms of gains and of losses. An inquiry is developed to study the Alentejo dryland farmers' preferences, which intend to determine risk preferences through a set of games. A discrete sequential stochastic programming model is developed to examine farmers' decision-making process face to the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy. The objective function, that maximizes the total value of the game, portrays the farmers' behavior face to risk and it is constituted by the set of functions (value function and probability weighting function) ranked upward. The total value of the games will be given by the sum of the positive and negative components. Model results show that Cumulative Prospect Theory portrays the Alentejo dryland farmers' decision-making process quite well. All the farmers produce durum wheat as main agricultural production and choose the maximum of number of cattle heads and sheep herds. The full decoupling of income payment from agricultural production leads to the abandonment of the durum wheat production. The beef cattle farmers keep their production and the sheep farmers reduce their herds drastically. The introduction of 50 % of <b>sheep</b> <b>premium,</b> proposed by the Portuguese Government, raises sheep production, accompanied of the increase of the pasture area. These results permit to conclude that the Portuguese Government's proposal is sufficiently cautious because, on the one hand, when associating to 100 % of suckler cow premium allows the use of the shares negotiated with European Union in 2003 and when associating to 50 % of <b>sheep</b> <b>premium</b> permit the maintenance of sheep herd. On the other hand, the Portuguese Government's proposal of crop subsidies not linked to agricultural production forces the farmers to choose alternative agricultural activities in the bad soils. Finally, the introduction of the area crop-yield insurance program associated with the new Common Agricultural Policy is an interesting alternative for the Alentejo dryland farmers, because the new Common Agricultural Policy only secure a minimum farm income level, while the insurance program permits making face to agricultural production variability and avoids the abandonment of the agricultural activity.

40|$|While wool growing is an {{important}} component of the economy, few wool growers make a good return on capital from wool alone, relying more, where they can, on opium poppies, potatoes, prime lambs, wood chips, tourists and cattle. Potential investments in the productivity of the runs equal the somewhat risky potential returns. The runs are regarded as economically valuable for fodder, particularly for <b>sheep</b> producing <b>premium</b> fine micron wool, and shelter. They are managed in a wide variety of ways, partly reflecting the nature of properties, and partly as a matter of choice between alternative systems, based on perceptions of risks and returns. Rotational grazing and set stocking systems have different challenges and benefits, as do burning and not burning. There are different ways and degrees of controlling wild herbivores and weeds.

30|$|Monitoring guanacos in Santa Cruz {{could be}} wrongly {{considered}} unaffordable by wildlife managers if not evaluated within a cost-benefit analysis. The economic cost of well interspersed survey transects throughout the territory, {{developed by a}} team of three experienced observers during 10 to 15 days, should be counterbalanced against the potential economic benefit of direct income derived from guanaco products and the large conservation benefits arising from land use diversification. Additionally, considering the relatively predictable guanaco local distribution due to male territorial fidelity over the years, the effect of management practices on guanaco populations could be easily surveyed and monitored to evaluate trends (Young and Franklin 2004 a). The sustained yield harvesting of guanaco wool and/or meat, complementary or <b>supplementary</b> to <b>sheep</b> ranching, may be {{the most effective way to}} conserve guanacos (Fritz and Franklin 1994) and other wildlife, if land owners acknowledge the potential economic return of this species. Diversifying land uses and adopting sustainable forms of guanaco exploitation should be the shared objectives of Argentine wildlife agencies, as a potential mechanism pursuing both the reduction of the ecological damage of sheep overgrazing and the socioeconomic improvement of rural communities in Patagonia rangelands.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Tunisia, {{like many}} other {{countries}} in the world, suffers from a shortage of feedstuffs and an overall nutrition problem is facing the livestock industry. Large quantities of feeds are imported to meet the animals' needs in energy and protein. At the same time, considerable quantities of crop residues and agro-industrial wastes suitable for use as feed for the animals are lost or underutilized. Grape pomace, which is the refuse left from the production of grape juice and wine, constitutes {{one of the most important}} crop residues, second only in volume to straw.

50|$|In 1839 Osmond Gilles {{was part}} of a {{syndicate}} of nine investors that established the Hutt River Special Survey in the Clare Valley. As a result, around 1841 Oakden relinquished town life to take up managing sheep grazing properties in that locality. Among these was Kadlunga (also spelt Cadlunga, Tadlunga and Katalunga in earliest times), held under an occupation licence by James Stein. Kadlunga, beside Mount Horrocks and near Mintaro, was in later decades a <b>premium</b> <b>sheep</b> stud owned by Sir Samuel Way. During Oakden's time in the Clare Valley Mount Oakden (altitude 568 m) at nearby Penwortham was named for him. He was a close associate of neighbouring pastoralist John Ainsworth Horrocks, whose brother Arthur Horrocks resided with Oakden at Kadlunga from 1846 until his marriage in 1850, at which Oakden was groomsman. In 1846 Oakden had leased Kadlunga from Stein, who in 1848 became insolvent. Oakden then managed it until 1850.|$|R
40|$|Animal {{health and}} {{production}} management practices used on sheep and beef cattle properties in south-eastern Australia {{have been shown}} in recent surveys, and by consultancy work undertaken by the University of Melbourne Mackinnon Project, to be suboptimal in several areas. Implementation of many advances from research in animal nutrition, production and health in the field has been poor. For example, in sane districts up to 80 % of sheep flocks lamb during autumn and early winter. A change to a spring lambing would enable more sheep to be run on these properties without increasing winter stocking rates. Control of internal parasites on most properties could be improved through the correct timing and use of effective anthelmintics, awareness of the emerging problem of anthelmintic resistance, and planning low risk pastures for weaner <b>sheep.</b> <b>Supplementary</b> feeding could be used more cost-effectively by monitoring the live weight of young sheep over the dry summer and autumn months. Footrot, lice, fleece diseases, blowflies, stocking rate, flock structure, genotype, genetic improvement programs, and poor financial planning cause widespread problems. Each farm presents a unique combination of factors contributing to suboptimal performance, and each farmer has a different attitude to change and risk. Since regional extension methods have generally been unsuccessful in transferring research findings to the farm gate, {{it seems that the}} solution to improving suboptimal performance in the field is to have consultants and advisers working directly with the farmer who is charged for the services provided. The most important limitation at present is the availability of consultants trained to take a whole farm approach...|$|R
40|$|Chamaecytisus palmensis (Tagasaste) is a leguminous {{perennial}} shrub which grows {{well in a}} {{range of}} climatic zones. Tagasaste was introduced from the Canary Islands to Australia in 1879 and a number of farmers are growing the shrub for fodder production and soil conservation. The most economical means of utilizing tagasaste in Australia appears to be direct grazing by sheep. This thesis reports on a study of tagasaste and lucerne as a supplementary summer feed for sheep in the Strathfieldsaye Research Station, East Gippsland, Victoria. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate the relative value of feeding tagasaste and lucerne (Medicago sativa) as a <b>supplementary</b> feed for <b>sheep</b> during summer. Growth performance of sheep, dry matter consumed and the chemical composition of feeds were examined over the four months of the experimental period. The 240 two year old Merino sheep were divided into 12 groups for grazing eight plots of tagasaste and four plots of lucerne as a supplement to summer pasture. Each plot had been fenced into four or six subplots for tagasaste or lucerne respectively, to allow stock to be rotated in four months. The estimation of the dry matter consumed in each subplot was done by selecting 50 sample quadrats before and after grazing for each experimental month. The mean liveweight gain for all sheep in the lucerne plots (11. 3 kg/head) was not significantly different from tagasaste (10. 6 kg/head) at the end of the experiment. The mean total change in standing dry matter due to grazing in the tagasaste treatment (5360 kg/ha) over the four months was greater than for the lucerne treatment (3384 kg/ha). The overall daily growth efficiency over the daily dry matter (LW (g) /DM (g)) eaten by sheep in tagasaste was 0. 20 % and 0. 34 % for lucerne over the experimental period. In both treatments the pattern of pasture dry matter consumption did not resemble the pattern of liveweight gain. The digestibility and total nitrogen content of feed types were not significantly different between trial months. However, the leaf part of tagasaste had significantly greater values than other feed types during the trial although lucerne leaf was not measured. During the trial there was no loss of liveweight in sheep fed tagasaste or lucerne as a supplement. A second experiment indicated that tagasaste regrowth after grazing was significantly better in lightly grazed plots than in heavily grazed plots suggesting that farmers remove stock before all leaf has been eaten. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that there is scope for the summer grazing tagasaste as a supplement to dry pasture however lucerne remains a better feed than tagasaste on this site. The high quality of tagasaste foliage (leaf) and low rate of liveweight gain of the experimental sheep suggest that further study is necessary to identify the cause of low stock performance.

40|$|Much of {{southern}} Australia has endured widespread vegetation clearance which has, through habitat loss and fragmentation, induced declines in regional avifauna and confined remaining populations to small, isolated patches of remnant vegetation where their numbers continue to fall. Conserving populations of fauna in highly fragmented agricultural landscapes is increasingly reliant on developing systems which can serve production {{as well as}} biodiversity. In recent times, perennial monoculture plantings of native tree and shrub species have been advocated {{as a means to}} increase the amount of woody vegetation in fragmented agricultural landscapes, enhance connectivity and provide supplementary habitat for wildlife. In the South Australian Murray Mallee, plantings of Old Man Saltbush (Atriplex nummularia nummularia) have been established as <b>supplementary</b> fodder for <b>sheep.</b> Preliminary research has recognised these plantings as a potential source of habitat and resources for native birds. The benefits these areas may provide to birds remain largely speculative and in depth investigations are required to fully understand the potential of saltbush plantings to contribute to the longevity of populations in highly fragmented agricultural zones. This thesis represents a detailed ecological analysis of how birds use saltbush plantings. Initially the analysis identifies which species of birds use saltbush plantings before examining White-browed Babblers (Pomatostomus superciliosus), Variegated Fairy-wrens (Malurus lamberti) and Chestnut-crowned Babblers (P. ruficeps) in detail to determine the extent to which saltbush plantings are used, for what purposes, the resources provided by the plantings and the factors driving these patterns. Repeated surveys of saltbush plantings and remnant vegetation showed the bird community found in plantings represented a significantly reduced suite of species compared to that found in remnant vegetation. Plantings did however represent areas of greater value to birds compared with cleared agricultural land. This value was substantially increased when adjacent to remnant vegetation which had the added benefit of encouraging greater numbers of bird species to make use of plantings. This study also identified White-browed Babblers, Variegated Fairy-wrens and Chestnut-crowned Babblers as several of the species most common in these areas, confirming them as focal species for further study. Direct observation of foraging by White-browed Babblers, Variegated Fairy-wrens and Chestnut-crowned Babblers revealed saltbush plantings represented substantial foraging habitat for these species. Babblers displayed highly plastic foraging ecologies, enabling them to exploit the foraging resources afforded by saltbush plantings. Despite this plasticity, babblers remained reliant on remnant vegetation for other elements, particularly those associated with breeding and nesting. Variegated Fairy-wrens remained solely within saltbush where they showed foraging ecology little changed from natural chenopod habitats. The highly plastic and adaptive foraging ecologies of these three species enable them to exploit saltbush plantings and hence they are among the most commonly encountered. Detailed analysis of home range and internal patterns of spatial use exhibited by the focal bird species revealed key elements driving habitat selection. All showed clear selection toward areas with greater cover of dense shrub-level foliage, revealing an inherent dependence on cover presumably to minimise predation risk. The distribution of vegetative cover was found to be a key driver of foraging ecology, habitat use and patterns of spatial use in both saltbush plantings and remnant vegetation. The distribution of foraging resources was examined by assessing the availability of invertebrate prey across the home ranges of the focal bird species. Invertebrate availability did not differ between intensely foraged areas and areas of no use, revealing prey distribution to be evenly distributed in both saltbush plantings and remnant vegetation. Cover dependence was therefore confirmed as the predominant driver of habitat selection patterns among these birds. Saltbush plantings represent vegetation in which foraging resources can be found by a small number of bird species with highly plastic ecologies suited to exploiting a range of habitats. Despite their plasticity, several of these species, along with the majority of bird species in the region, remain reliant on remnant vegetation. In order to better manage saltbush plantings for biodiversity it is necessary to base practices on sound ecological research which demonstrates the importance of cover, heterogeneous vegetation and adjacency to remnant vegetation.

40|$|Kangaroo Island is of high conservational {{significance}} {{with the}} largest remaining interface between native vegetation and agriculture in South Australia. The two main native herbivores on Kangaroo Island are the western grey kangaroo and the tammar wallaby. Two introduced herbivores, sheep and feral goat, {{also contributed to the}} study. All animal species coexist in the north western districts of Kangaroo Island. All species coexisted at the Borda Vale property, Cape Borda and Correll property de Mole River field sites. Competition between mammals on Kangaroo Island was investigated to determine if the Hutchinson Theory of Interspecific Competition could be either rejected or not-rejected. Hutchinson’s theory states that an animal needs to be at least 2. 1 times either larger or smaller in body weight than another competitor in the same environment to escape the influences of interspecific competition. The current investigation was two pronged; comprising field studies with subsequent analysis of plant cuticles from faecal matter, and secondly scientific trials on the mainland held at The University of Adelaide, Roseworthy campus, South Australia. The in situ field studies involved collecting faecal samples from each species and pasture comparison at three sites. The pasture structure {{on both sides of the}} recently erected boundary fence at two sites on Borda Vale was determined. Plant cuticles from faecal samples provide insight to the dietary composition for each species, and any dietary overlap between species. The body condition of all herbivores in the trial was assessed prior to the pen trials. Recognised body condition assessment methods for sheep and goat were available, but not for the macropods. Therefore, a condition score system (CS) was devised utilising biological indices as the basis of the CS system. Pen trials included species-specific pens and mixed species pens, a total of eleven half hectare pens. Each pen had the same pasture plant structure with a plant survey determining the level of competition among the four species. A palatability/cafeteria trial of the pen plant species was undertaken by placing replicated plant specific pots in a test arena to record food preference for each animal species. Animals from each of the four species had mouth characteristic data recorded to detect any morphological differences which could provide an alternative explanation to the Hutchinson theory. Pasture at all three sites fluctuated with seasonal condition, with the exception of bryophytes, that were only present in pastures on Borda Vale. The dietary overlap results (average C 0. 14) indicated a low dietary overlap among the four herbivores throughout the four seasons. However, the greatest average seasonal dietary overlap result was between pairs of herbivores, occurring in spring (C 0. 76 and C 0. 85), when regrowth is at its greatest. In summer (C 0. 70) and autumn (C 0. 67) the dietary overlap decreased slightly, due to diversification of plant species eaten, with the increase of native browse vegetation in the diet. The wallaby, the smallest competitor, is in direct competition with the three larger competitors, with the greatest competition for resources being with the kangaroo (C 0. 90) throughout the seasons. The condition score (CS) indices were applied to both macropods. However; the focus was mainly on the CS system for the tammar wallaby. The development of the CS system included four body indices. The system has five condition score levels, ranging from level one, representing an animal in very poor body condition, to level five, representing an animal in optimal condition. The boundary between being fit for this trial work and not fit occurred at CS 2 and CS 3. Locomotive performance was impaired below CS 3. Therefore, animals that failed to achieve CS 3 status were rejected from inclusion in the trials. The two pen trials, one replicated and one pseudo-replicated, indicated that all herbivore species ate all of the pasture species on offer. Only a proportion of the competitive interactions between the mammalian grazing herbivores of Kangaroo Island were consistent with the predictions of the Hutchinson Theory. The results of the study produced some instances in which the smallest animal was the more effective forager. In several instances, no differences were detected, and in two instances (Althaea officinalis and Heliotropium europaeum) two of the larger grazers were more effective than the wallaby. Also, there was an instance in which one large herbivore had an advantage over another large herbivore for Tribulus terrestris. However, it appeared that the wallaby ate none of the oat grain (Avena sativa) even though it was the most abundant potential food source available in the trial pens. Further investigations of the palatability of fodder in the pen trial are indicated. Further investigation into the association between the wallaby and ingestion of oat grain were undertaken. Wallabies ate oat grain only as a last resort, and were not able to maintain good body condition on a diet of oats. The finding that wallabies find oat grain unpalatable has ramifications for the farmers and conservation management on Kangaroo Island during drought condition, when hand feeding of oat grain is the major form of <b>supplementary</b> feeding of <b>sheep.</b> Many factors may explain the lack of support for the Hutchinson Theory of size displacement in this study. The absolute morphological characteristics of lip length, incisor length, tongue length and lower dental arcade width of the wallaby were statistically smaller than all the larger herbivores species in this study. Although the morphological differences (corrected for scale) in mouth structures revealed some statistically different characteristic among the four herbivores with no wallaby characteristic being statistically smaller or larger than all of the larger herbivores species. Other factors that could explain species diet separations, thereby reducing direct competition, are discussed including, height of reach, eye sight, height of vegetation preferences, temporal and diurnal separation. The Hutchinson Theory is not supported in the current field study either, with the wallaby clearly in direct competition with the three larger herbivores on Kangaroo Island with the greatest competitor of the wallaby being the kangaroo. The pen trials only provided weak support for the Hutchinson Theory which provides only one explanation of competitive separation. Therefore, this theory is simplistic when there are many alternative explanations that allow dietary separation and reduce direct interspecific competition. This research highlights management issues that have important implications for the farmer and conservation managers on Kangaroo Island. Thesis (Ph. D.)
