40|$|In this paper, an {{extended}} library of smooth local trigonometric bases is defined, and an appropriate fast "best-basis" search algorithm is introduced. When {{compared with the}} standard local cosine decomposition (LCD), the proposed algorithm is advantageous in three respects. First, it leads to a best-basis expansion that is shift-invariant. Second, the resulting representation {{is characterized by a}} lower information cost. Third, the polarity of the folding operator is adapted to the parity properties of the segmented signal at the end-points. The shift-invariance stems from an adaptive relative shift of expansions in distinct resolution levels.

The SP310 was based on a {{modified}} Bluebird 310 sedan platform instead of the truck platform of earlier models. It featured an 85 hp 1.5 L (1,497 cc) G15 engine (from the Cedric) but with a single SU carburettor. Only 300 SPL310's were equipped with the single carb and these first few had only 77 HP as opposed to the 85 HP of the dual carb models built in 1964 and 1965. A four-speed manual transmission was the only <b>shifting</b> <b>option</b> and has a non-syncro'd first gear. The rear axle used the shafts and differential also from the Cedric. It was a well-equipped car with a transistor radio, tonneau cover, map lights, and a clock. The first SP310s (1963-1964) also had a unique sideways third seat in the rear.|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} {{tax reform}} proposal introduced by Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT) on November 19, 2013 contains several significant innovations {{that promise to}} define {{the terms of the}} debate for the foreseeable political future. It is therefore worth examining in detail even if it seems unlikely that progress toward meaningful reform can be achieved very soon. The major component of the proposal is a move toward territoriality coupled with two alternative anti-profit <b>shifting</b> <b>options,</b> option Y and option Z. This article will argue that option Y represents a significant step forward and can be the basis of adopting a territorial regime, while option Z is deeply flawed and risks further profit shifting unconstrained by the current limits on repatriating profits. Other important innovations in the Baucus proposal include a new destination based tax on Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs) on their sale of goods and services into the US; a major modification of the PFIC rules and other simplification measures; and a significant rollback of the portfolio interest exemption. This article will analyze each of these elements of the proposal and then offer some suggestions for further improvement. The two major missing elements from the proposal are additional broad limitations on inbound base erosion and preventative measures against corporate expatriations...|$|R

40|$|The {{intent of}} this study is to explore the musical, structural, and intervallic {{relationship}} between Krzysztof Penderecki's two works for viola, the Concerto for Viola and Orchestra and Cadenza for Viola Solo. The Concerto for Viola is a twenty-minute work accompanied by full orchestra; the Cadenza for Viola Solo is an eight-minute solo work. In these viola works, Penderecki has encapsulated the characteristics of the viola: the tone, technical capacity, and character. Both of Penderecki's viola works demand and reinforce the unique qualities of the viola. This document provides a performance guide to help a performer develop more insight and understanding of the viola's individual qualities that are represented in these pieces. The comparison between the Concerto for Viola and Cadenza for Viola Solo is discussed in three sections. First, the two works are divided into logical sections and compared to one another in a parametric structure chart. The musical and structural features discussed in the performance analysis include motivic elements, articulations, rhythmic ideas, dynamics. The highest tier consists of larger concepts, such as structure, phrasing, and sequential patterns. The lower tiers focus on detailed comparisons including dynamics, note patterns, and fingerings. These musical and structural analyses of the Concerto for Viola and Cadenza for Viola Solo are represented in flowcharts. These flowcharts evaluate, along an aerial view, similarities and dissimilarities between sections, the merging of one section with another, and the formal structure of the two works. The second analysis is a process based on applying to each pitch a specific numerical value. Each pitch is assigned a designated number, and the two pieces are compared solely on these numbers. The numbers indicate the intervallic relationships of motives, phrases, and sequences of each work. The numerical comparisons demonstrate consistent correlations between the two works that are not evident through other methods of analysis. Finally, the Cadenza for Viola Solo is analyzed from a performer's perspective. These performance issues focus on certain sections that require more detailed guidance, inclusive of bowing technique, <b>shifting</b> <b>options,</b> vibrato, and dynamic considerations...|$|R

For Apple laptops with a removable battery, resetting the PMU involves unplugging the power adapter, disconnecting the battery, then holding down the power button for five seconds. Another PMU-related fix would be to reset the logic board, where one removes the backup battery on the board for a few minutes, then reinstalls it, causing the PMU to reset itself with clean, fresh parameters (that need to be corrected, if desired, to its previous state) during the next Mac OS boot (for typical PC users, this is similar to [...] "resetting the CMOS").|$|R
40|$|Green grams (Phaseolus aures L.) {{and tomato}} (Solanum lycopersicum L) are widely {{grown in the}} vertisols of the Mwea Irrigation Scheme {{alongside}} the rice fields. Green grams can fix nitrogen (biological nitrogen fixation) and are grown for its highly nutritious and curative seeds while tomatoes are grown for its fruit rich in fibres, minerals and vitamins. The two can be prepared separately or together {{in a variety of}} ways including raw salads and/or cooked/fried. They together form significant delicacies consumed with rice which is the major cash crop grown in the black cotton soils. The crops can grow well in warm conditions but tomato is fairly adaptable except under excessive humidity and temperatures that reduce yields. Socio-economic prioritization by the farming community and on-farm demonstrations of soil management options were instituted to demonstrate enhanced green gram and tomato production in vertisol soils of lower parts of Kirinyaga County (Mwea East and Mwea West districts). Drainage management was recognized by the farming community as the best option although a reduced number of farmers used drainage and furrows/ridges, manure, fertilizer and <b>shifting</b> <b>options</b> with reducing order of importance. Unavailability of labour and/or financial cost for instituting these management options were indicated as major hindrances to adopt the yield enhancing options. Labour force was contributed to mainly by the family alongside hiring (64. 2 %) although 28 % and 5. 2 % respectively used hired or family labour alone. The female role in farming activities dominated while the male role was minimal especially at weeding. The youth role remained excessively insignificant and altogether absent at marketing. Despite the need for labour at earlier activities (especially when management options needed to be instituted) it was at the marketing stage that this force was directed. Soils were considered infertile by 60 % but 40 % indicated that their farms had adequate fertility. Analysis showed that ridging and application of farm yard manure and fertilizer improved fertility, crop growth and income considerably. Phosphate and zinc enhancement reduced alkalinity and sodicity. Green gram and tomato yields increased under ridges and farm yard manure application by 17 - 25 % which significantly enhanced household income...|$|R

25|$|Though all the {{communities}} had had partial success with gaining interest from African-Americans none {{had had to}} deal strongly with opposition in such matters {{and none of them}} had made a point of focusing on it as a priority. A national policy among Bahá'ís had started to form from work of Gregory meeting with Bahá'ís at Fisk University in 1934, a spiritual assembly in Nashville was elected in 1935, and a regional conference was proposed in 1936 to include a visit from the National Assembly. The development encountered the question of a high-profile series of integrated meetings. Indeed, one of the hotel's hosting one of the six resulting meetings objected and the Bahá'ís appeared to relent. W. E. B. DuBois noticed and initially was misinformed {{of the nature of the}} resolution to which then secretary of the national assembly Horace Holley responded that the facts were not as DuBois understood them and that it was the hotel that had relented at the last minute - however a policy had been stated that, short of out of control reactions, integrated meetings should be held but in the case of over-reactions segregated meetings could be held with a longer term goal of fully integrated ones theoretically. But in this case the situation was avoided by the change in judgement of the hotel. All of the <b>shifting</b> <b>options</b> became mute when in 1938 a final policy was voiced - published under the title Advent of Divine Justice by Shoghi Effendi with a frank and prolonged discussion of the problem of race prejudice underscoring the short-term requirement and long term goal of complete integration and freedom from racial prejudice. All meetings were to be integrated and individuals to seek to adjust their habits in the matter. In addition, a matter of policy began that in tie votes in elections minorities were to be automatically given approval of the position. One result was the formation of a Race Unity Committee in 1940 with Louis Gregory and Dorothy Beecher Baker, a White descendent of abolitionists. A situation in the Atlanta Bahá'í community was resolved with integration even to the point of letting White people leave the religion if they couldn't accept the standard. Correspondence among South Carolinian communities buzzed with the development.|$|R
