60|$|They {{had decided}} against {{retracing}} their steps {{over the ground}} already traveled, and took the train to San Francisco. They had been warned by Mark Hall of the enervation of the south, and were bound north for their blanket climate. Their intention was to cross the Bay to Sausalito and wander up through the coast counties Here, Hall had told them, they would find the true home of the redwood. But Billy, in the smoking car for a cigarette, seated himself beside {{a man who was}} destined to deflect them from their course. He was a keen-faced, dark-eyed man, undoubtedly a Jew; and Billy, remembering Saxon's admonition always to ask questions, watched his opportunity and started a conversation. It took but a little while to learn that Gunston was a commission merchant, and to realize that the content of his talk was too valuable for Saxon to lose. Promptly, when he saw that the other's cigar was finished, Billy invited him into the next car to meet Saxon. Billy would have been incapable of such an act prior to his sojourn in Carmel. That much at least he had acquired of <b>social</b> <b>facility.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Let me add, at {{the same}} time, that Mrs. Bronson's <b>social</b> <b>facility,</b> which was really her great refuge from importunity, a defence with serious thought and serious feeling quietly {{cherished}} behind it, had its discriminations {{as well as its}} inveteracies, and that the most marked of all these, perhaps, was her attachment to Robert Browning. Nothing in all her beneficent life had probably made her happier than to have found herself able to minister, each year, with the returning autumn, to his pleasure and comfort. Attached to Ca' Alvisi, on the land side, is a somewhat melancholy old section of a Giustiniani palace, which she had annexed to her own premises mainly for the purpose of placing it, in comfortable guise, at the service of her friends. She liked, as she professed, when they were the real thing, to have them under her hand; and here succeeded each other, through the years, the company of the privileged and the more closely domesticated, who liked, harmlessly, to distinguish between themselves and outsiders. Among visitors partaking of this pleasant provision Mr. Browning was of course easily first. But I must leave her own pen to show him as her best years knew him. The point was, meanwhile, that if her charity was great even for the outsider, this was by reason of the inner essence of it-- her perfect tenderness for Venice, which she always recognised as a link. That was the true principle of fusion, the key to communication. She communicated in proportion--little or much, measuring it as she felt people more responsive or less so; and she expressed herself, or in other words her full affection for the place, only to those who had most of the same sentiment. The rich and interesting form in which she found it in Browning may well be imagined--together with the quite independent quantity of the genial at large that she also found; but I am not sure that his favour was not primarily based on his paid tribute of such things as [...] "Two in a Gondola" [...] and [...] "A Toccata of Galuppi." [...] He had more ineffaceably than anyone recorded his initiation from of old.|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of <b>social</b> <b>facilities</b> {{in a region}} needs to be adjusted to the standard needs of regional public facilities to {{serve the needs of}} the population. Evaluation of the availability and needs of <b>social</b> <b>facilities</b> is important to support regional development. Besides that, <b>social</b> <b>facilities</b> can be an emergency infrastructure facility when disaster strikes. The existence of schools, health facilities, means of worship, a building or meeting hall becomes very important when a disaster occurs and requires rapid, appropriate, and emergency evacuation. The preparation of public infrastructure for emergency response service is one of the quick response of evacuation and anticipation of disaster victims. The results of this study are the analysis of the <b>social</b> <b>facilities</b> availability and <b>social</b> <b>facilities</b> needs as a means of public infrastructure in Banjarnegara Regency based on Indonesian National Standard. By using the analysis of serviceability, it can be evaluated the availability and needs of <b>social</b> <b>facilities</b> based on the region and can be included in regional development planning...|$|R
40|$|Batam Centre area, {{as one of}} {{the trading}} area, is also the {{government}} centre of Batam City. As a developing area, Batam Centre is located in a very strategic area and has high land value. The rapid growth in the area development makes many housing developers actively build and develop settlements in Batam Centre area. In less than 12 years, housing development faster than the other area, indicated by several new housing and settlements built on unused lands. The housing development which is not supported by <b>social</b> <b>facilities</b> will create new community problems such as difficulties in finding school nearby the settlement or any other problems. Batam Centre was chosen in the research because of its rapid development, the large settlement area, and its relatively equal land value. In this research; a study will be carried on how far do the <b>social</b> <b>facilities</b> which are developed by the developer influence the selling price of the housing. The research used qualitative and quantitative analysis. The qualitative analysis explained the condition/problems {{in the shape of a}} description, critical idea, and comparison. The research used a normative qualitative analysis i. e. an analysis on the ideal conditions which follow the standards/rules. The analysis used simple statistic (frequency distribution) and cross tab which will give clue in the level of the variables. From the analysis result, it is shown that the availability of <b>social</b> <b>facilities</b> influenced the selling price of housing in Batam City. The more complete <b>social</b> <b>facilities</b> the developer builds, the higher selling price it gets. Although the correlation between availability of <b>social</b> <b>facilities</b> and the selling price does exist, the influence is not as strong as the location factor. Location factor is the main factor in determining the selling price. The prospective consumers consider the availability of <b>social</b> <b>facilities</b> as an added value in buying houses besides the location factor. The result of this research recommends the developers to allocate more funds for building <b>social</b> <b>facilities</b> in housing development. The allocated fund can be used to build more <b>social</b> <b>facilities</b> type and number in order to attract more prospective consumers. On the other hand, it is necessary that the developers make efforts in making good cooperation with the government, investors, and the local community in providing needed <b>social</b> <b>facilities</b> as determined in KEPMEN PU (Decree of The Minister of Public Work) standard). And need the research of the others factor that influence the selling price of the housing, except the <b>social</b> <b>facilities</b> factor.

40|$|OPACs are {{regarded}} as one of the most important intermediaries between library users and their collections. Through them one can find, identify and access desired information resources. A while ago, the very nature of OPACs made holdings of libraries and information centers available throughout the world but the real interaction between users and the collection was far beyond reach. Now through new technologies, such as Web 2. 0, Library 2. 0 and OPAC 2. 0, a higher level of user interaction is possible. The first part of this paper identified a set of OPAC 2. 0 elements. A checklist was prepared based on these elements, then using it, 7 different OPAC softwares were assessed. Among the studied OPACs, “Sana” was identified as the most successful OPAC in both searching and <b>social</b> <b>facilities.</b> Regarding these <b>social</b> <b>facilities,</b> “ParsAzarakhsh” and “Parvan” were in a rather good state.
