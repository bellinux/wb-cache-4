5|$|Dismantled in 1937, {{the bridge}} was {{relocated}} to Capon Lake in southeastern Hampshire County to carry Capon Springs Road (West Virginia <b>Secondary</b> <b>Route</b> 16) between West Virginia Route 259 and Capon Springs. The bridge was dedicated on August 20, 1938. In 1991, a new bridge was completed to the south, and the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was preserved {{in place by the}} West Virginia Division of Highways, due to its rarity, age, and engineering significance. The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 15, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the subway}} system {{operates}} on a 24-hour basis, during late night hours {{some of the}} designated routes do not run, run as a shorter route (often {{referred to as the}} 'shuttle train' version of its full-length counterpart) or run with a different stopping pattern. These are usually indicated by smaller, <b>secondary</b> <b>route</b> signage on station platforms. Because there is no nightly system shutdown for maintenance, tracks and stations must be maintained while the system is operating. This work sometimes necessitates service changes during midday, overnight hours, and weekends.|$|E
50|$|Roadways {{on public}} (K-12) school campuses are also <b>secondary</b> <b>routes</b> and are {{numbered}} in the 9000 to 9999 range. Unlike other <b>secondary</b> <b>routes,</b> these {{do not duplicate}} within the state and are often unsigned.|$|R
50|$|The Kentucky Revised Statute 177.020(1) {{provides}} that the Department of Highways, {{a part of}} the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, is responsible for the establishment and classification of a State Primary Road System which includes the state primary routes, interstate highways, parkways and toll roads, state <b>secondary</b> <b>routes,</b> rural <b>secondary</b> <b>routes</b> and supplemental roads. These routes are listed below.|$|R
50|$|County councils remain {{responsible}} for {{local and regional}} roads, as well as various tasks like setting speed limits. The NRA, meanwhile, was {{responsible for}} the planning, maintenance and construction of National Primary <b>Routes</b> and National <b>Secondary</b> <b>Routes</b> as well as establishing safety measures. Ireland's national road network consists of 2739 km of National Primary Routes and 2676 km of National <b>Secondary</b> <b>Routes.</b>|$|R
5|$|US 5 roughly {{follows the}} route {{used by the}} Upper Boston Post Road, an early colonial highway for {{transporting}} mail between New York City and Boston. The route was first improved in 1798 as the Hartford and New Haven Turnpike, which ran in a nearly straight line between the court houses of New Haven and Hartford. In 1922, the Upper Boston Post Road corridor was designated as Route 2 of the New England road marking system, crossing {{to the east of}} the Connecticut River in Hartford before continuing north to the Massachusetts state line. In 1926, Route 2 was redesignated as U.S. Route 5. Several realignments {{have been made in the}} cities of New Haven and Hartford with the opening of several expressways in these areas. Because it is closely paralleled by Interstate 91 between New Haven and Hartford, US 5 serves mainly as a <b>secondary</b> <b>route</b> today.|$|E
5|$|Caudy {{never learned}} to write in English; he signed his last will and {{testament}} with an X mark in 1784. Caudy died on March 15, 1784, and was interred on his property south of present-day Capon Bridge. According to local tradition, Caudy was buried with a Native American on either side of him. Another tradition says he was buried with his horse. The site of Caudy's interment is located on property now known as Hartford Bealer farm. In the 1930s, Caudy's burial site was attended to by a local Boy Scouts troop, who landscaped the site and planted shrubbery. By 1976, Caudy's burial place was marked with four posts. In 2002, the Capon Bridge Ruritan Club removed the overgrown shrubs and erected a white fence around Caudy's interment site. The project was initiated by Capon Bridge area residents Roy Giffin, Ken Edmonds, and Roberta Munske. The Ruritans purchased a marble marker and erected it on the site at 9 a.m. on November 15, 2003. The burial site is accessible and visible from Christian Church Road, West Virginia <b>Secondary</b> <b>Route</b> 13.|$|E

25|$|The Rimutaka Incline was difficult, {{costly and}} {{time-consuming}} to operate, {{but as the}} Wairarapa Line had become a <b>secondary</b> <b>route</b> since the acquisition of the Wellington and Manawatu Railway in 1908, its replacement was not a priority. Various alternate systems and routes were debated, with a tunnel chosen in 1936. However, the economic conditions left from the Great Depression followed by the impact of World War II meant that work on the tunnel did not start until 1948. The Incline and the line up {{the western side of}} the Rimutakas closed on 29 October 1955 and the tunnel opened on 3 November 1955.|$|E
25|$|Government {{statements}} {{suggested that}} the UBC line would be {{an extension of the}} SkyTrain network from VCC–Clark station via elevated platforms or a tunnel along Broadway ending at the University of British Columbia in the University Endowment Lands. This would mean that commuters from Coquitlam to UBC would not need to change trains during their commute, as Millennium Line trains would continue to UBC from Lafarge Lake–Douglas station. Commuters from the Evergreen Extension east of Commercial–Broadway station would also have a <b>secondary</b> <b>route</b> to downtown with the option of transferring to the Canada Line instead of the Expo Line. However, light rail and higher-capacity bus rapid transit was also proposed.|$|E

The N32 was added in 1996 and the N33 was added after its completion.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} the 2006 Thanksgiving holiday in Seattle, Washington, the Kims (James, Kati, {{and their two}} daughters, Penelope and Sabine) set out for their home in San Francisco, California. On Saturday, November 25, 2006, having left Portland, Oregon, {{on their way to}} Tu Tu Tun Lodge, a resort located near Gold Beach, Oregon, the Kims apparently missed a turnoff from Interstate 5 to Oregon Route 42, a main route to the Oregon Coast. Instead of returning to the exit, they consulted a highway map and picked a <b>secondary</b> <b>route</b> that skirted the Wild Rogue Wilderness, a remote area of southwestern Oregon. It is also possible that they may have planned to take this route.|$|E
25|$|The area of China {{south of}} the Nanling Mountains, known as the Lingnan (roughly modern Guangxi and Guangdong), was {{originally}} home to peoples known to the Chinese as the Hundred Yue (Baiyue). Large-scale Han Chinese migration to the area began after the Qin conquest of the region in 214 BC. Successive waves followed at times of upheaval in North China, such as the falls of the Han, Tang and Song dynasties. The most popular route was via the Xiang River, which the Qin had connected to the Li River by the Lingqu Canal, and thence into {{the valley of the}} Xi Jiang (West River). A <b>secondary</b> <b>route</b> followed the Gan River and then the Bei Jiang (North River) into eastern Guangdong. Yue-speakers were later joined by Hakka-speakers following the North River route, and Min-speakers arriving by sea.|$|E

The N/M18 road links the county to Ennis and Galway while the N24 {{continues}} south eastwards from Limerick towards Waterford travelling through villages such as Pallasgreen and Oola. The N69, a <b>secondary</b> <b>route</b> travels from Limerick City along the Shannon Estuary through Clarina, Kildimo, Askeaton Foynes & Glin and continues towards Listowel in County Kerry. It {{is the main}} road linking the Port of Foynes with Limerick city, although plans are in place to upgrade this road to motorway status.
