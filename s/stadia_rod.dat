25|$|There is {{a diverse}} range and {{combination}} of methodologies employed {{to understand the}} hydrological dynamics in salt marshes {{and their ability to}} trap and accrete sediment. Sediment traps are often used to measure rates of marsh surface accretion when short term deployments (e.g. less than one month) are required. These circular traps consist of pre-weighed filters that are anchored to the marsh surface, then dried in a laboratory and re-weighed to determine the total deposited sediment. For longer term studies (e.g. more than one year) researchers may prefer to measure sediment accretion with marker horizon plots. Marker horizons consist of a mineral such as feldspar that is buried at a known depth within wetland substrates to record the increase in overlying substrate over long time periods. In order to gauge the amount of sediment suspended in the water column, manual or automated samples of tidal water can be poured through pre-weighed filters in a laboratory then dried to determine the amount of sediment per volume of water. Another method for estimating suspended sediment concentrations is by measuring the turbidity of the water using optical backscatter probes, which can be calibrated against water samples containing a known suspended sediment concentration to establish a regression relationship between the two. Marsh surface elevations may be measured with a <b>stadia</b> <b>rod</b> and transit, electronic theodolite, Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System, laser level or electronic distance meter (total station). Hydrological dynamics include water depth, measured automatically with a pressure transducer, or with a marked wooden stake, and water velocity, often using electromagnetic current meters.|$|E
50|$|Other {{forms of}} {{tacheometry}} in surveying {{include the use}} of stadia rods with theodolites or plane-table alidades. These use stadia marks on the instrument's reticle to measure the distance between two points on the <b>stadia</b> <b>rod</b> (the stadia interval). This is converted to distance from the instrument to the <b>stadia</b> <b>rod</b> by multiplying the stadia interval by the stadia interval factor. If the <b>stadia</b> <b>rod</b> is not at the same elevation as the instrument, the value must be corrected for the angle of elevation between the instrument and the rod.|$|E
50|$|Stadia {{readings}} used in surveying can {{be taken}} with modern instruments such as transits, theodolites, plane-table alidades and levels. When using the stadia measuring method, a <b>stadia</b> <b>rod</b> is held so that it appears between two stadia marks visible on the instrument's reticle. The <b>stadia</b> <b>rod</b> has measurements written on it that can be read through the telescope of the instrument, providing a known length for the distance calculations.|$|E

50|$|A normal {{levelling}} rod {{can be used}} for stadia measures at shorter distances (up to about 125 m). For longer distances, special stadia rods are better suited. In order to provide good visibility at long distances, stadia rods are typically wider than {{levelling rod}}s with larger markings. Since very fine gradations are not necessary for long sights, they may be left off the dedicated <b>stadia</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An {{instrument}} {{equipped for}} stadia work has two horizontal stadia marks spaced equidistant {{from the center}} crosshair of the reticle. The interval between stadia marks in most stadia instruments gives a stadia interval factor of 100. The distance between the instrument and a <b>stadia</b> <b>rod</b> can be determined simply by multiplying the measurement between the stadia hairs (known as the stadia interval) by 100.|$|E
5000|$|The stadia marks are set a {{specific}} distance apart. The distance is chosen {{so that there}} is a fixed, integer ratio between the distance observed between the marks and the distance from the telescope to the measuring device observed. This is known as the stadia constant or stadia interval factor. For example, a typical stadia mark pair are set so that the ratio is 100. If one observes a <b>stadia</b> <b>rod,</b> rule or levelling rod with the telescope and sees that the rod spans 0.5m between the marks (the stadia interval), then the distance from the instrument to the rod is: ...|$|E

5000|$|The tunnel was {{constructed}} {{as part of}} the Milwaukee Road's [...] "Pacific Coast Extension" [...] project, undertaken {{in the first decade of}} the 1900s. It expanded its concentration of railroad lines in the upper Midwest area of Milwaukee-Chicago-Minneapolis-St. Paul across the Rocky Mountains to Washington, ending at the Seattle-Tacoma area on Puget Sound. The construction occurred late in the historical era of American railroading; it was the last transcontinental line built. Surveying began in 1901 and continued until 1909, when a final golden spike was driven in Montana at Garrison. [...] The St. Paul Pass route was surveyed from Butte starting in August 1906 and continuing through November, using the tools of the era: transit, <b>stadia</b> <b>rod,</b> surveying chain, and barometer. [...] The Milwaukee Road was committed to a route with no more than a two percent grade, and the surveying west of Butte to the St. Paul Pass was thorough and extensive; it covered some 1400 mi in order to select a route of 240 mi. [...] As a result of this diligent work, the surveyors and engineers achieved a very even low grade of 1.7% grade from Haugan on the east to Avery on the west in Idaho. [...] This gentle gradient allowed trains to cross the pass with long loads fairly easily. Exiting the west portal in Idaho, the route descends through several shorter tunnels, to Avery at just under 2500 ft, and on down the St. Joe River another 300 ft to St. Maries.|$|E

Historically, the peninsula coast has experienced measurable coseismic uplift (maximum of ~ 1 m) and uplift was again observed during this event.

40|$|Rodeo Creek drains {{approximately}} 1. 2 mi 2 {{in coastal}} Marin County, California, debouching into the Pacific Ocean at Pt. Bonita in Golden Gate National Recreational Area. We documented the current degree of channel incision. Channel incision can lower adjacent water tables and cause bank collapse, which can increase sediment load resulting in aggradation downstream. Lower water tables can desiccate the native wetland community and allow non-native vegetation to become established. We measured eight cross sections {{along the length}} of Rodeo Creek using measuring tape and a <b>stadia</b> <b>rod</b> to measure top of bank, thalweg, high water marks, and inflection points along the banks. We made detailed sketches of channel morphology and vegetation at each cross section. We compared the resulting incision profiles of Rodeo Creek with a stream incision study of Walker Creek in northern Marin County by William Haible (1976). Rodeo Creek is less incised than Walker Creek. The most severe incision in Rodeo Creek was less than 7 ft compared to an average of 18 ft in Walker Creek. The incision in Rodeo Creek is still cutting through the alluvial fill of clays and silts as no evidence of bedrock was seen in any of the cross sections. In contrast, Walker Creek has hit bedrock. Rodeo Creek may still be in the initial stages of incision. This may indicate that more severe incision is to come as incision evolution progresses in Rodeo Creek. Clear management objectives may allow incision to progress at a more natural rate...|$|E
