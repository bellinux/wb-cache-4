5|$|In an interview, Borten {{revealed}} that he met Melisa Wallack in 2000 {{and asked her to}} help with the script, to which she <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> In 2001, after one year of working on the script, they sold it to producer Robbie Brenner, who then set Marc Forster to direct the film for Universal Pictures, but left due to some personal delays. In June 2008, Craig Gillespie and Ryan Gosling were in talks to join the film, which was to be produced by David Bushell and Marc Abraham for Universal Pictures and Strike Entertainment. Chase Palmer was writing the script that time around, and screenwriters Guillermo Arriaga and Stephen Belber had reportedly also written the subsequent drafts for the film. In 2009, producer Robbie Brenner got involved again and rejected all the rewrites of the script, and the original version by Borten and Wallack was sent to actor Matthew McConaughey to see if the Dallas native would be interested in playing the role. On March 9, 2011, Jean-Marc Vallée was confirmed to direct the film based on the script by Borten and Wallack. Rachel Winter also attached to produce the film.|$|E
25|$|November 17, 2008: The jurors, {{charged with}} {{determining}} whether the convicted killer {{is eligible for}} the death penalty, <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> But, {{they found that the}} State had not proven that Addison purposely murdered Officer Briggs.|$|E
60|$|Ferdinand Barnacle laughed, and <b>said</b> oh <b>yes,</b> he {{believed}} so. A vote was a vote, and always acceptable.|$|R
6000|$|Stephen's {{naturally}} gentle {{nature was}} touched, {{and it was}} in a troubled voice that he <b>said,</b> 'Yes, <b>yes.</b> I am unjust in that--I own it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... --Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom <b>said.</b> O <b>yes,</b> we'll {{have all}} topnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in fact.|$|R
25|$|McAnly {{said that}} Cottrell invited Phillips to his Elizabethtown motel room. When Phillips arrived, Cottrell asked if Phillips liked him without his shirt, and when Phillips <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> and touched him, Cottrell {{put him in}} a {{headlock}} and choked him.|$|E
25|$|ITV News West Country {{presenter}} Ian Axton has a cameo in episode one. Axton jokingly asked show creator Chris Chibnall if {{he could}} appear in series two after Chibnall appeared on his show. Chibnall surprisingly contacted him some time later and <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b>|$|E
25|$|On October 1, 2006, an {{interview}} of Woodward by CBS reporter Mike Wallace was broadcast {{on the television}} show 60 Minutes. Wallace mentioned the Murtha-Abizaid conversation. Wallace asked Woodward to confirm that Murtha had told him of this tale of meeting with Abizaid; Woodward nodded his head in assent and <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Plornish became suspicious. Seemed to scent a creditor. <b>Said,</b> 'Ah, <b>yes.</b> Well. He didn't {{know what}} {{satisfaction}} {{he could give}} any gentleman, respecting that family. What might it be about, now?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You speak French!” she <b>said.</b> “Yes, <b>yes,</b> monsieur, I feel {{it as much}} as any. There is one who is {{very dear}} to me a {{prisoner}} in England. He is a soldier.” ...|$|R
6000|$|An Apparition! Madam, <b>said</b> I, <b>yes,</b> to be sure; why you know, you {{are nothing}} else but an Apparition; {{and what else}} would you be, when it is so {{infinitely}} to your Advantage? ...|$|R
25|$|The {{surviving}} Pythons {{had agreed}} {{in principle to}} perform a live tour of America in 1999. Several shows were to be linked with Q meetings in various cities. Although all had <b>said</b> <b>yes,</b> Palin later changed his mind, much to the annoyance of Idle, who had begun work organising the tour. This led to Idle refusing {{to take part in}} the new material shot for the BBC anniversary evening.|$|E
25|$|Mother {{is picked}} up by Rufus, Knight's pilot, and goes to help Knight while Schofield is {{captured}} by the French and brought to an aircraft carrier {{to explain to him}} why he is to be terminated. At Killian's castle, Gant is brutally murdered on a guillotine. However, Knight escapes, Gant's final words being for Knight to tell Schofield she would have <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> to his planned proposal. Rufus, Mother, and Knight go to rescue Schofield.|$|E
25|$|Hiartuar asked Wigg if {{he wanted}} to fight for him, and Wigg <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> Hiartuar wanted to give Wigg a sword, but he insisted on {{receiving}} it by taking the hilt. Having the hilt in his hand, Wigg pierced Hiartuar with the sword and so avenged Roluo. Swedes and Geats then rushed forward and killed Wigg. The Swedish king Høtherus (based on the god Höðr), the brother of Athislus, succeeded Roluo and became the king of a combined Sweden and Denmark.|$|E
6000|$|Mr Nadgett {{rubbed his}} hands slowly, stroked his chin, looked round the room, and <b>said,</b> 'Yes, <b>yes,</b> I think it's a good case. I am {{disposed}} to think it's a good case. Will you go into it at once?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mamma {{was over}} at Mrs. George Warners to lunch the other day, and [...] Miss H---- was there too. Mamma asked if {{anything}} {{as natural as}} [...] near sightedness could be cured she <b>said</b> oh <b>yes</b> {{just as well as}} [...] other deseases.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Titmarsh," [...] said Lady Fanny, {{laughing}} to me, [...] "who is {{that great}} fat curious man, {{the master of}} the house? Do you know he asked me if you were not related to us? and I <b>said,</b> 'Oh, <b>yes,</b> you were.'" ...|$|R
25|$|A month later, he {{returned}} and asked Connolly {{if he was}} still interested in doing business. Connolly <b>said</b> <b>yes,</b> but {{that he would not be}} able to sell him any as he had gotten some bottles of P2P elsewhere and was busy making another batch. Three days later, Shapiro returned with a search warrant. Among other items, he seized two bottles of P2P, one an empty 500-g container, the other a partially full 100-g one (not the one he had originally given them). All three were arrested and charged with five separate violations of federal drug laws.|$|E
25|$|Indie {{asked me}} if I would keep the Barely Legal Radio program on Indie but stop doing mornings. I <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> I loved doing the morning show for 2½ years but I am also looking forward to not getting up at 4 am any more. If you've ever had a morning job like this, you {{probably}} know the relief I feel, but I will still miss seeing Liz and Jose every day, having David Lynch as my weatherman, and talking to Timothy Olyphant about sports each morning. These will always rank with the coolest things I’ve ever been fortunate enough to do in my entire life.|$|E
25|$|Starrcade was headlined by the feud between Ric Flair and Harley Race {{over the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship. In 1981, Flair {{was chosen by}} the NWA board of {{directors}} to become the champion and won the title from Dusty Rhodes on September 17 in Kansas City, Kansas, where Rhodes and Flair were not major names. Flair felt that the match was poorly orchestrated due to the location, and because Rhodes was unhappy about losing the title. Initially, Flair was not well accepted as the champion by the promoters and fans in certain territories. On June 10, 1983, Race won the title from Flair, and began his seventh reign as the champion. The NWA wanted Race to win title to set flair up as long term champ at Starcade '83. Harley was reluctant, but <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "The Sergeant was wrong!" [...] exclaimed the guide, {{laughing}} amid his agony, {{in a way}} to terrify {{his companion}} by the unnatural mixture of anguish and light-heartedness. [...] "I knew it, I knew it, and <b>said</b> it; <b>yes,</b> the Sergeant was wrong after all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One day I just {{named it}} to him, {{and asked him}} if he knew Fanny's young man. He <b>said,</b> 'Oh <b>yes,</b> he knew the young man as well as he knew himself, and that there wasn't a man in the {{regiment}} he liked better.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|... “The {{focus of}} that story was {{obviously}} Dave Bliss, but other people {{got caught up in}} it, which is unfortunate,” Koncak <b>said.</b> “But, <b>yes,</b> there had been some benefits while I was at SMU, and I did accept some of those benefits. What I did was against the rules." ...|$|R
25|$|Many gay men {{and lesbians}} had children, {{especially}} if they had been previously married. Over 50 per cent of homosexuals who had been married had children. When they asked homosexuals whether they would be disturbed if their own children became homosexual, between 25 and 33 per cent <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> Between 69 and 77 per cent said {{that they would not be}} upset, or only a little upset, if one of their children became homosexual. Compared to heterosexuals, homosexuals were much less likely to marry: 25 per cent of homosexuals married and 75 per cent did not, while for heterosexuals, the proportions were roughly reversed. When homosexuals did marry, they had less heterosexual intercourse and fewer children than heterosexuals. Some other findings were that 1 per cent of gay men were attracted to feminine qualities in a man, that gay men had little interest in competitive sport, and that older gay men were more likely than younger gay men to concentrate on fellatio. Bell and Weinberg were unable to explain the finding about sport, and were wary of concluding that the differences in sexual behavior between older and younger gay men represented a shift in sexual mores.|$|E
500|$|McCartney asked Klein to {{dissolve}} the Beatles' partnership, but was refused. Exasperated, he took {{the case to the}} High Court in London in early 1971, naming Klein and the other Beatles as defendants. Among the six reasons McCartney gave for dissolving the Beatles was that Klein's company, ABKCO, had caused [...] "intolerable interference" [...] by overdubbing [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] without consulting McCartney. In his written affidavit, Starr countered this statement by saying that when Spector had sent acetates of Let It Be to each of the Beatles for their approval, with a request also for feedback: [...] "We all <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> Even at the beginning Paul <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> I spoke to him on the phone, and said, 'Did you like it?' and he said, 'Yeah, it's OK.' He didn't put it down." [...] Starr added: [...] "And then suddenly he didn't want it to go out. Two weeks after that, he wanted to cancel it." ...|$|E
500|$|Donaldson {{returned}} to Yorkshire {{and signed a}} one-year contract with another Championship club, Sheffield United, on 31 August 2017. The undisclosed fee was described by the Birmingham Mail as [...] "nominal". After scoring both of his team's goals in a 2–1 away win at Sunderland on his debut on 9 September, Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder commented: [...] "Not bad for 50 grand that, is it? Not bad from Aldi... We are delighted to get Clayton. He's a good kid. I {{know a lot about}} him. I've tried to sign him enough times, I should know about him. He <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> to me eventually." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Open it!" [...] <b>said</b> Lucy--"why, <b>yes,</b> Pierre, yes; what secret thing keep I from thee? Read {{me through}} and through. I am entirely thine. See!" [...] and tossing open the portfolio, {{all manner of}} rosy things came {{floating}} from it, and a most delicate perfume of some invisible essence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some of it," [...] said he. [...] "You {{were after}} Wilkinson once, in a burrow, I believe, and you swore dreadfully {{because he got}} out of the other end. I can't {{remember}} all the things you <b>said.</b> Oh, <b>yes,</b> once you were talking to Auguste de St. Gre about money." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{hesitated a}} moment; {{and then the}} thought, that I might never see her again, came over me, and I <b>said,</b> 'Oh, <b>yes!</b> thanks.' That was the last earthly word of love between us. But, thank God, those who love worthily never meet for the last time: {{there is always a}} future.|$|R
500|$|In March 1980 Sellers {{asked his}} fifteen-year-old {{daughter}} Victoria {{what she thought}} about Being There: she reported later that, [...] "I <b>said</b> <b>yes,</b> I thought it was great. But then I said, 'You looked like a little fat old man'.... he went mad. He threw his drink over {{me and told me}} to get the next plane home." [...] His other daughter Sarah told Sellers her thoughts about the incident and he sent her a telegram that read [...] "After what happened this morning with Victoria, I shall be happy if I never hear from you again. I won't tell you what I think of you. It must be obvious. Goodbye, Your Father." ...|$|E
500|$|Dan Koretzky, {{founder of}} Drag City, ordered 200 {{copies of the}} EP for the Chicago Reckless Records store he worked for at the time. Koretzky asked Kannberg if he would sign to Drag City during the same phone call that he ordered the EP. Kannberg remembered expressing {{reluctance}} to sign to any label, but Drag City producer and session musician Rian Murphy recalled that [...] "We asked, they <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> Lives didn't {{seem to be on}} the line." [...] Chris Lombardi and Gerard Cosloy of Matador Records also first heard of Pavement after Kannberg sent a copy of Slay Tracks to their zine, Conflict. Matador signed Pavement in 1992 for the release of their debut studio album, Slanted and Enchanted.|$|E
500|$|Later in 1957, Cagney ventured {{behind the}} camera {{for the first and}} only time to direct Short Cut to Hell, a remake of the 1941 Alan Ladd film This Gun for Hire, which in turn was based on the Graham Greene novel A Gun for Sale. Cagney had long been told by friends that he would make an {{excellent}} director, so when he was approached by his friend, producer A. C. Lyles, he instinctively <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> He refused all offers of payment, saying he was an actor, not a director. The film was low budget, and shot quickly. As Cagney recalled, [...] "We shot it in twenty days, and that was long enough for me. I find directing a bore, I have no desire to tell other people their business".|$|E
6000|$|... 'O, he does!' <b>said</b> Mac-Morlan.' Yes, <b>yes,</b> I can {{understand}} that better. And pray, Mr. Sampson, are these three hours entirely spent inconstruing and translating?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes?" [...] he <b>said.</b> [...] "Oh <b>yes,</b> I've {{heard him}} sing. Not lately. He does drawing-room ballads {{and all that}} sort of thing still, I suppose?" ...|$|R
