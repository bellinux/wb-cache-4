5|$|The {{most common}} writing mediums found in archaeological digs from ancient sites predating the Han period are shells and bones {{as well as}} bronzewares. In the {{beginning}} of the Han period, the chief writing mediums were bamboo (Chinese: 竹簡) and clay tablets, silk cloth, and rolled scrolls made of <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> bamboo sewn together with hempen string passed through drilled holes (册) and secured with clay stamps. The written characters on these narrow flat <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> bamboo were arranged into vertical columns.|$|E
5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> paper were cut into the shape of twisted trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves through a maze of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E
5|$|Burnside {{was noted}} for his unusual facial hair, joining <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> hair {{in front of}} his ears to his {{mustache}} but with the chin clean-shaven; the word burnsides was coined to describe this style. The syllables were later reversed to give sideburns.|$|E

5|$|Rolling / Shaping:The damp {{tea leaves}} are then rolled to be formed into {{wrinkled}} strips, by hand or using a rolling machine which causes the tea to wrap around itself. This rolling action also causes {{some of the}} sap, essential oils, and juices inside the leaves to ooze out, which further enhances {{the taste of the}} tea. The <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> tea can then be formed into other shapes, such as being rolled into spirals, kneaded and rolled into pellets, or tied into balls, cones and other elaborate shapes. In many types of oolong, the rolled <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> tea leaf are then rolled to spheres or half spheres and is typically done by placing the damp leaves in large cloth bags, which are then kneaded by hand or machine in a specific manner. The tea can also be pressed into bricks through the use of heavy stones or presses.|$|E

5|$|This early era was {{followed}} by peace and cultural expansion between the 12th and late 18th century.

5|$|A uniform tiling is a tiling {{in which}} each tile is a regular polygon and in which every vertex can be mapped to every other vertex by a {{symmetry}} of the tiling. Usually, uniform tilings additionally are required to have tiles that meet edge-to-edge, but if this requirement is relaxed then there are eight additional uniform tilings. Four are formed from infinite <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> squares or equilateral triangles, and three are formed from equilateral triangles and regular hexagons. The remaining one is the Pythagorean tiling.|$|E

5|$|Away colours {{have tended}} to be either white—often with black shorts—or a {{combination}} of yellow and black, referring back to the black and gold <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> the pre-war era, although for a time in the 1970s, Aberdeen sported an all-blue change strip with white socks.

5|$|Cadet George Washington Street, of Wisconsin, was {{identified}} as the first person ever to score a touchdown for the Naval Academy. The Baltimore Sun stated that William Abrose O'Malley, of Pennsylvania, was the cadet who caught Street's blocked kick and scored the second touchdown. The Sun also covered, in detail, the uniforms the squads wore; Johns Hopkins sported blue, black, and white striped uniforms, while the Naval Academy wore maroon and white uniforms. Both teams also nailed <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> leather {{to the bottom of}} their shoes to help deal with slipping.|$|E
5|$|Helmets made {{entirely of}} bronze were also used, {{while some of}} them had large cheek guards, {{probably}} stitched or riveted to the helmet, as well as an upper pierced knot to hold a crest. Small holes all around the cheek guards and the helmet's lower edge were used for the attachment of internal padding. Other types of bronze helmets were also used. During the late Mycenaean period, additional types were also used such as horned helmets made of <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> leather.|$|E

5|$|Specialised {{football}} boots {{began to emerge}} in the professional era, taking the place of everyday shoes or work boots. Players initially simply nailed <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> leather to their boots to enhance their grip, leading the Football Association to rule in 1863 that no nails could project from boots. By the 1880s these crude attachments had become studs. Boots of this era were made of heavy leather, had hard toecaps, and came high above a player's ankles.|$|E

To make the deadline, Rahman did a live re-recording of both the soundtrack and score to finish them on time.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{recorded}} that the Han Dynasty (202 BC– AD 220) court eunuch Cai Lun (50 AD– AD 121) invented the pulp papermaking process and established {{the use of}} new materials used in making paper, ancient padding and wrapping paper artifacts dating to the 2nd century BC {{have been found in}} China, the oldest example of pulp papermaking being a map from Fangmatan, Tianshui; by the 3rd century, paper as a writing medium was in widespread use, replacing traditional but more expensive writing mediums such as <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> bamboo rolled into threaded scrolls, <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> silk, wet clay tablets hardened later in a furnace, and wooden tablets. The earliest known piece of paper with writing on it was discovered in the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, where Han Dynasty troops had deserted their position in AD 110 following a Xiongnu attack. In the paper making process established by Cai in 105, a boiled mixture of mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens and fish nets created a pulp that was pounded into paste and stirred with water; a wooden frame sieve with a mat of sewn reeds was then dunked into the mixture, which was then shaken and then dried into sheets of paper that were bleached under the exposure of sunlight; K.S. Tom says this process was gradually improved through leaching, polishing and glazing to produce a smooth, strong paper. Paper is used a lot.|$|E
