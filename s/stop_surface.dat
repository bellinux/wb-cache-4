The present study focuses on designing low-cost household rainwater catchment systems to improve {{the quantity and quality}} of water available and therefore achieve higher standards of living for the Bisate village. Given the climatic and geographic characteristics of Bisate, rainwater harvesting represents one of the most appropriate solutions to improve water supply. The designed low-cost household rainwater catchment system consists of an excavated cistern of 6 cubic meters volume, lined with a plastic tarpaulin sheet and covered with a wood and iron lid, and with a hand pump to extract water. The cistern should provide an average of 16 liters/day/person for the entire year for medium-size houses (roof area of 35 m 2) and 21. 5 liters/day/person for large-size houses (82 m 2). The excavated cistern is designed with walls to <b>stop</b> <b>surface</b> runoff from entering into the cistern, and a hard cover and hand pump to extract water and minimize water contamination from faecal bacteria. The implementation of these small-scale rainwater harvesting systems should improve water quality and supply for the families of Bisate Village. (cont.) Indeed, household rainwater catchment systems should improve water consumption from less than 5 liters/day/person to at least 16 liters/day/person. The household rainwater catchment system can provide water inside or nearby the house, which is very important as it would drastically reduce travel time for women and children to fetch water. Freeing up time from daily "water walks" could significantly improve school attendance and trade activities, leading to increased education levels and average annual income. by Daria Cresti.

40|$|Extended Abstract 1 - IntroductionEach year Genaveh Port {{receives}} {{millions of}} tourists (2302154 people in Nowruz Holidays in 1390) {{from all over}} the country for its tourist attractions and trade and recreation centers. The presence of this huge populace has created several traffic problems, the main root of which can be found in the shortage or the incorrect positioning of the function of parking lots in this city. However, the issue gets into its peak in the time there is boom in tourism in holiday seasons. field data, a questionnaire with a sample size of 320 participants including 100 citizens and 220 tourists has been incorporated, This applied study uses a descriptive analytical research design. In the analysis of the current situation, and for providing the and SPSS has been used for further analysis. After assessing the area and the number of required parking lots applying parking building methods, the influential standards in situating public parking lots has been weighted through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in Arc GIS software zone, and then appropriate places for launching parking lots has been recognized by OWA (Ordered Weighted Average) fuzzy method. Results show that with regard to the need for 1863 parking lots in addition to the current lots in the studied area in one day, there exists no logical relations between the demanded parking lots and the existing parking lots in the city of Genaveh. Nevertheless, it should be admitted that the present parking lots in the city are appropriate considering the geographical standards; but limitations exist with regard to the number of these lots. Hence, considering the characteristics of this city, the most logical option is the use of smart parking. 2 - Theoretical Bases- Traffic Traffic is an international term; it means transportation vehicles and passersby walk on roads and adding three humans, vehicle and road are formed (Rezaei, 1369, p. 7). - <b>Stop</b> <b>surface</b> carThe average surface to stop any car is considered to be 14 square meters and the average number of passengers per car is two; thus, there is a need for at least 7 meters of the city for the parking of each passenger. Since car is a personal device, there is a need for at least two parking spaces for a car: one in the living place and the other in working place or sites such as shopping centers and city centers (Shahi, 1376, p. 85). - Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) The analytic hierarchy process is a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions. In this process, decision makers find the answer that best suits their goal. It provides a comprehensive and rational framework for structuring a decision problem. Analytic hierarchy process is based on pairwise comparisons, which makes it easy to judge the accuracy of calculations (Hosseini et al., 1389, p. 73). Geographical situation and population of GenavehGanaveh County is a county in the northwest of Bushehr Province in Iran. The county's area is 9. 69 square kilometers and Genaveh port is located in the Persian Gulf coast. According to the latest census in 2006, the county's population was 59, 583 (30, 169 males and 29, 414 females). 3 - DiscussionThis applied study has a descriptive – analytical nature. A questionnaire was completed by 320 participants including 100 residents and 220 tourists, and SPSS software was used for further analysis. After estimating the size and the number of required parking lots applying parking product method, the optimal locations for the construction of public parking lots in the city were identified using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in Arc GIS software zone, and then appropriate places for launching parking lots was determined by OWA fuzzy method. 4 - ConclusionFor locating parking lots the traditional method is used in most cities which is incapable of applying all effective parameters in location finding simultaneously and is time-consuming. These disadvantages make the constructed parking spaces useless. This made an increased interest in using the appropriate tools, which can simultaneously integrate a large number of spatial parameters, such as GIS. One of the most important stages in this process is to weight the parameters. Different weighting methods can lead to different results. Using GIS in situating parking lots instead of traditional methods increases the process speed and enhances the efficiency of suitable constructed parking. Weighting methods are less accurate than the AHP method due to lack of a strong theoretical basis. In locating parking spaces, the walking distance to the parking place is very important and in different places of the studied area which need more parking spaces and have heavy traffics, some places for constructing parking places should be found. 5 - SuggestionsAccording to statistics available, the parking area in Genvaeh is 56, 990 square meters and the required area for parking is 85, 997 m daily. Thus, the area needed for parking is 26, 072 m in addition to the existing parking spaces and we need 1863 parking lots in the studied area (city center) for a day.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The debris-rich glacier {{that grew}} in the crater of Mount St Helens after the volcano’s cataclysmic 1980 {{eruption}} was split in two by a new lava dome in 2004. For nearly six months, {{the eastern part of}} the glacier was squeezed against the crater wall as the lava dome expanded. Glacier thickness nearly doubled locally and surface speed increased substantially. As squeezing slowed and then <b>stopped,</b> <b>surface</b> speed fell and ice was redistributed downglacier. This sequence of events, which amounts to a field-scale experiment on the deformation of debris-rich ice at high strain rates, was interpreted using a two-dimensional flowband model. The best match between modeled and observed glacier surface motion, both vertical and horizontal, requires ice that is about 5 times stiffer and 1. 2 times denser than normal, temperate ice. Results also indicate that lateral squeezing, and by inference lava-dome growth adjacent to the glacier, likely slowed over a period of about 30 days rather than stopping abruptly. This finding is supported by geodetic data documenting dome growth...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} He+ and H+ {{implantation}} into LaF 3 substrates {{have been investigated}} at both room temperature and 77 K. At room temperature {{the surface of the}} samples becomes black, possibly due to chemical reduction effects, but at low temperature the crystals remain clear and a refractive index change is observed which produces a surface waveguide.

The ion implantation produces a thin optical barrier layer of low refractive index {{at the end of the}} ion range. This paper discusses the use of multiple-energy implantation to produce a broad optical barrier in order to reduce the tunnelling losses of the guides, and subsequent thermal annealing to reduce absorption and scattering losses caused by colour centre formation in the electronic <b>stopping</b> <b>surface</b> region of the guides.
