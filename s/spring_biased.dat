40|$|For ground {{testing of}} {{controlled}} flexible space structures an active suspension design is proposed to eliminate dynamic reaction {{forces from the}} suspension cables.

Moving mass reaction forces are compensated for by feedback of a hinge mounted dynamic force sensor output. The salient feature of the voice-coil type actuator is the on- line compensation of the inherent non-linear force-displacement characteristic by a high-speed signal processor. Due to the simple mechanical design the actuator can be easily adapted with respect to range and output force level.

This allows maintenance of normal intraocular pressure during glaucoma surgery.

The height of the column of liquid is selected such that the pressure at a hypodermic needle connected to {{the output of the}} pressure regulator is equal to the measured pressure of the eye. The hypodermic needle can then be safely inserted into the anterior chamber of the eye. Liquid is then bled out of the column to reduce the bias on the diaphragm of the pressure regulator and, consequently, the output pressure of the regulator. This lowering pressure of the regulator also occurs in the eye by means of a small second bleed path provided between the pressure regulator and the hypodermic needle. Alternately, a second hypodermic needle may be inserted into the eye to provide a controlled leak off path for excessive pressure and clouded fluid from the anterior chamber...|$|E
40|$|The {{space station}} {{configuration}} currently studied utilizes structures which require struts to be hinged {{in the middle}} in the stowed mode and locked into place in the deployed mode. Since {{there are hundreds of}} hinges involved, it is necessary that they have simple, positive locking features with a minimum of joint looseness or slack. This invention comprises two similar housings hinged together with a spring loaded locking member which assists in making as well as breaking the lock. This invention comprises a bracket hinge and bracket members with a <b>spring</b> <b>biased</b> and movable locking member. The locking or latch member has ear parts received in locking openings where wedging surfaces on the ear parts cooperate with complimentary surfaces on the bracket members for bringing the bracket members into a tight end-to-end alignment when the bracket members are in an extended position. When the locking member is moved to an unlocking position, pivoting of the hinge about a pivot pin automatically places the locking member to retain the locking member in an unlocked position. In pivoting the hinge from an extended position to a folded position, longitudinal spring members are placed under tension over annular rollers so that the spring tension in a folded position assists in return of the hinge from a folded to an extended position. Novelty lies {{in the creation of a}} locking hinge which allows compact storage and easy assembly of structural members having a minimal number of parts...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The main {{drawbacks}} of SMA actuators are a slow {{response and}} {{a waste of}} electric power. The power should be continuously supplied for SMA elements to remain austenite state until the actuator begins to take the other position. The problems are more serious when batteries and thick SMA elements are used. We propose a new SMA actuator which consumes little energy and responds very quickly. The actuator consists of a specially designed <b>bias</b> <b>spring</b> and two SMA elements which exert the force in opposite direction to each other. The <b>bias</b> <b>spring,</b> unlike a common spring which has one stable position, has two stable positions. A SMA 1, for instance, contracts on heating by electricity, the actuator takes one stable configuration. No further power supply is necessary to maintain the stable position, providing enough time for the SMA 1 to cool. When the other SMA 2 is heated, it contracts with enough force to move the <b>bias</b> <b>spring</b> and to expand the already-cooled SMA 1. Power supply stops immediately after the actuator takes the other stable configuration, causing power saving and quick response...|$|R

50|$|The stock NSX has a {{somewhat}} rearward <b>bias</b> in its <b>spring</b> and bar rates, where the rear is relatively quite stiff versus the front. This {{means that the}} lateral load transfer distribution, or the amount of load that is transferred across the front axle versus the rear while cornering, is rather rear biased. This can make the car quite lively and easy to rotate at low speed, but in higher speed corners this effect becomes more pronounced and can be a handful to manage. To reduce the tendency to oversteer, Honda fitted softer rear tires on the NSX. For the NSX-R, Honda reversed the <b>spring</b> <b>bias,</b> placing stiffer <b>springs</b> on the front suspension along with stiffer front sway bar. This shifts the load transfer stiffness balance farther forward, resulting in more rear grip {{at the expense of}} front grip; this has the effect of decreasing the oversteer tendency of the car, making it much more stable in high speed corners. Overall, the NSX-R uses much stiffer front sway bar along with stiffer springs than the stock NSX (21.0mm xt2.6mm front sway bar :F 3.0 kg/mm—R 4.0 kg/mm for the NSX versus F 8.0 kg/mm—R 5.7 kg/mm for the NSX-R).|$|R

Disturbing-torque levels about the gimbal axis or axes must be kept to extremely low values; the total tolerable disturbing torque from all sources whatever is often of the order of one dyne-cm or less. Special attention must be given to the electrical lead-in connections (a) to minimize mechanical hysteresis effects, which result in erratic bias changes, and (b) to minimize spring rate.

40|$|While {{standing}} naturally {{and when}} manually or pedally balancing an equivalent inverted pendulum, the load sways slowly (characteristic unidirectional duration ∼ 1 s) and the controller, calf muscles or hand, makes more frequent adjustments (characteristic unidirectional duration 400 ms). Here we test {{the hypothesis that}} these durations reflect load properties rather than some intrinsic property of the human neuromuscular system. Using a specialized set-up mechanically analogous to real standing, subjects manually balanced inverted pendulums with different moments of inertia through a compliant spring representing the Achilles tendon. The <b>spring</b> <b>bias</b> was controlled by a sensitive joystick via a servo motor and accurate visual feedback was provided on an oscilloscope. As moment of inertia decreased, inverted pendulum sway size increased and it became difficult to sustain successful balance. The mean duration of unidirectional balance adjustments did not change. Moreover, the mean duration of unidirectional inverted pendulum sway reduced only slightly, remaining around 1 s. The simplest explanation is that balance was maintained by a process of manual adjustments intrinsically limited to a mean frequency of two to three unidirectional adjustments per second corresponding to intermittent control observed in manual tracking experiments. Consequently the inverted pendulum sway duration, mechanically related to the bias duration, reflects an intrinsic constraint of the neuromuscular control system. Given the similar durations of sway and muscle adjustments observed in real standing, we postulate that the characteristic duration of unidirectional standing sway reflects intrinsic intermittent control rather than the inertial properties of the body...|$|R
