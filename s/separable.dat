5|$|Although {{the score}} is through-composed, within the general {{structure}} of the opera there are several identifiable numbers: four solos given to the three main characters, a trio and a brief love duet. Only Lauretta's O mio babbino caro, the best-known of the solos, is <b>separable</b> from its context and can be sung as a concert piece.|$|E
5|$|His {{historical}} {{account of}} the expedition included a description of platinum as being neither <b>separable</b> nor calcinable. Ulloa also anticipated the discovery of platinum mines. After publishing the report in 1748, Ulloa did not continue to investigate the new metal. In 1758, {{he was sent to}} superintend mercury mining operations in Huancavelica.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{birds in}} Asia can be {{confused}} with the similar lesser whistling duck, although that species is smaller, has a blackish crown and lacks an obvious dark stripe down the back of the neck. Juvenile fulvous whistling ducks are very like young lesser whistling ducks, but the crown colour is still a distinction. Juvenile comb ducks are bulkier than whistling ducks and have a dark cap to the head. In South America and Africa, juvenile white-faced whistling ducks are <b>separable</b> from fulvous by their dark crowns, barred flanks and chestnut breasts.|$|E
5|$|Although less used, the {{separability}} {{assumption is}} considered more general because every stochastic process has a <b>separable</b> version. It {{is also used}} {{when it is not}} possible to construct a stochastic process in a Skorokhod space. For example, separability is assumed when constructing and studying random fields, where the collection of random variables is now indexed by sets other than the real line such as -dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} is possible, originally developed by Anatoliy Skorokhod and Andrei Kolmogorov, for a continuous-time stochastic process with any metric space as its state space. For {{the construction of}} such a stochastic process, {{it is assumed that}} the sample functions of the stochastic process belong to some suitable function space, which is usually the Skorokhod space consisting of all right-continuous functions with left limits. This {{approach is}} now more used than the separability assumption, but such a stochastic process based on this approach will be automatically <b>separable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The RTV-A-2 Hiroc (high-altitude rocket) was the United States' {{first attempt}} at an {{intercontinental}} ballistic missile (ICBM). The project was initially under the name MX-774, however the project was canceled in 1947, and leftover funds were used to build and launch three missiles, which were renamed to RTV-A-2 Hiroc. The design included several innovations; the gimballed engine provided guidance control, the internal gas pressure was used to support the airframe and the nose cap was <b>separable.</b> All of these concepts were later used on the Atlas missile.|$|E
5|$|The {{proboscis}} (plural – proboscises) {{is formed}} from maxillary galeae and is adapted for sucking nectar. It {{consists of two}} tubes held together by hooks and <b>separable</b> for cleaning. Each tube is inwardly concave, thus forming a central tube up which moisture is sucked. Suction is effected through the contraction and expansion of a sac in the head. The proboscis is coiled under the head when the insect is at rest and extended only when feeding. The maxillary palpi are reduced and even vestigial. They are conspicuous and five-segmented {{in some of the}} more basal families and are often folded.|$|E
5|$|Three {{subspecies}} {{were identified}} by Goldman in 1935, M.p. columbiana, M.p. pacifica, and M.p. pennanti. Later research has debated whether these subspecies could be positively identified. In 1959, E.M. Hagmeier concluded that the subspecies are not <b>separable</b> based on either fur or skull characteristics. Although some debate still exists, in general it is recognized that the fisher is a monotypic species with no extant subspecies.|$|E

25|$|A {{product of}} at most countably many <b>separable</b> spaces is <b>separable.</b> A {{countable}} product of second-countable spaces is second countable, but an uncountable product of second-countable spaces need {{not even be}} first countable.|$|E

25|$|A theorem {{attributed}} to Mazur asserts that every infinite-dimensional Banach space V contains a basic sequence, i.e., {{there is an}} infinite-dimensional subspace of V that has a Schauder basis. The basis problem is the question asked by Banach, whether every <b>separable</b> Banach space has a Schauder basis. This was negatively answered by Per Enflo who constructed a <b>separable</b> Banach space failing the approximation property, thus a space without a Schauder basis.|$|E

25|$|The Heine–Borel theorem for {{complete}} totally bounded <b>separable</b> metric spaces (where covering is by {{a sequence of}} open balls).|$|E
25|$|The Vitali {{covering}} theorem is not valid in infinite-dimensional settings. The {{first result}} {{in this direction}} was given by David Preiss in 1979: there exists a Gaussian measure γ on an (infinite-dimensional) <b>separable</b> Hilbert space H so that the Vitali covering theorem fails for (H,nbsp&Borel(H),nbsp&γ). This result was strengthened in 2003 by Jaroslav Tišer: the Vitali covering theorem in fact fails for every infinite-dimensional Gaussian measure on any (infinite-dimensional) <b>separable</b> Hilbert space.|$|E

25|$|Given an {{abstract}} <b>separable</b> factor, one {{can ask for}} a classification of its modules, meaning the <b>separable</b> Hilbert spaces that it acts on. The answer is given as follows: every such module H can be given an M-dimension dimM(H) (not its dimension as a complex vector space) such that modules are isomorphic {{if and only if}} they have the same M-dimension. The M-dimension is additive, and a module is isomorphic to a subspace of another module if and only if it has smaller or equal M-dimension.|$|E
