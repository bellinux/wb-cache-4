5|$|With {{the other}} females not {{selected}} for immediate death, Frank {{was forced to}} strip naked to be disinfected, had her head shaved, and was tattooed with an identifying number on her arm. By day, the women were used as slave labour and Frank was forced to haul rocks and dig rolls of sod; by night, they were crammed into overcrowded barracks. Some witnesses later testified Frank became withdrawn and tearful when she saw children being led to the gas chambers; others reported that more often she displayed strength and courage. Her gregarious and confident nature allowed her to obtain extra bread rations for her mother, sister, and herself. Disease was rampant; before long, Frank's skin became badly infected by scabies. The Frank sisters were moved into an infirmary, which {{was in a state}} of constant darkness and infested with rats and mice. Edith Frank <b>stopped</b> <b>eating,</b> saving every morsel of food for her daughters and passing her rations to them through a hole she made at the bottom of the infirmary wall.|$|E

25|$|In 1927, Alexandra and {{her mother}} moved to Ascot, Berkshire, in the United Kingdom. They were greeted by Sir James Horlick, 4th Baronet and his family, who harbored them in their castle near the hippodrome. Now seven years old, Alexandra was {{enrolled}} in boarding schools in Westfield and Heathfield, as was the custom for the upper class. However, the Princess took very badly to this experience: separated from her mother, she <b>stopped</b> <b>eating</b> and eventually contracted tuberculosis. Alarmed, Aspasia thus moved her daughter to Switzerland for treatment. Later, Alexandra was educated in a Parisian finishing school, during which time she {{and her mother}} stayed at the Hotel Crillon.|$|E

25|$|One final film in {{this period}} was an {{original}} work scripted by Daniella Carmi. The Woman Who <b>Stopped</b> <b>Eating</b> (1991) {{is the story of}} a troubled scriptwriter who wants to write a feature film about a woman who stops eating. She turns to a film director who is also going through a crisis in his life, and together they begin to weave a story about this imaginary woman. The tension soon erupts, however, because the screenwriter wants to keep her story in the realm of the imaginary, while the director struggles to adopt a more realistic approach to the storyline. In some way, the story reflected the tensions marking Loevy's own career as both a documentarian and a dramatist.|$|E
25|$|Although live jewelry has {{featured}} in Mayan cultural traditions for many centuries, {{it was not}} until the 1980s that the Mexican maquech beetle, a subspecies of the zopherus beetle, achieved mainstream popularity as live jewelry. The maquech beetle is a large, docile, wingless insect which is decorated with gold and semi-precious gemstones and is attached to a decorative safety pin by a chain leash. During the Mayan period, women from the Yucatán Peninsula wore maquech beetles pinned to their chests, over their hearts, to attract and sustain loving relationships. The tradition is attributed to a story from Mayan folklore, which believes that when a Mayan princess was not permitted to marry a prince from a rival clan whom she loved, she <b>stopped</b> <b>eating</b> and drinking, preferring to die than to live without her lover. In compassion with her plight, a traditional healer with magical powers transformed her into a maquech beetle, so that she could spend the rest of her life living as a beautiful brooch on the chest of her lover, close to his heart.|$|E

500|$|A biographer {{states that}} in 1993, the {{entertainer}} admitted taking Valium, Xanax, and Ativan {{to deal with}} the stress of the child sexual abuse allegations made against him. While Jackson himself does not mention sedatives, he stated that painkillers were prescribed to soothe excruciating pain that he was suffering after recent reconstructive surgery on his scalp resulting from his accident in 1984. A few months after the allegations became news, Jackson had lost approximately [...] in weight and had <b>stopped</b> <b>eating.</b> In a court deposition unrelated to alleged child abuse, Jackson was visibly drowsy, lacked concentration, and repeatedly slurred while speaking.

500|$|Lionel Luthor {{is portrayed}} in the program by John Glover; Glover said he appreciates the [...] "clear canvas" [...] {{he had to work}} with when {{developing}} his portrayal of Lionel. In season one, Glover traveled from New York to Vancouver every week while filming his scenes because he was already committed to stage appearances in New York at the time. When portraying the character's struggle with terminal liver disease, Glover was inspired by a friend's battle with cancer; he said his friend was a [...] "cheerleader to people", who supported and boosted others when they were feeling bad. When Glover's friend learned he had cancer he fought hard to get over it, but when he learned that it was terminal he went to bed and <b>stopped</b> <b>eating</b> until he died about ten days later. This helped Glover understand how someone powerful and full of life could commit suicide—which Lionel prepares to do when he learns his illness is terminal.|$|E
