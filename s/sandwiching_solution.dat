40|$|Publicado em "Rheology and {{processing}} of construction materials", ISBN 978 - 2 - 35158 - 137 - 7 Insulated sandwich panels are often composed of external concrete layers, mechanically connected through metallic elements, such as trusses. Due to their high thermal conductivity, metallic connectors tend to cause thermal bridges {{on the building}} envelope. In view of this problem, an innovative <b>solution</b> for <b>sandwich</b> slabs is proposed {{within the framework of}} a pre-fabricated modular housing system. The referred slabs are based on a <b>sandwich</b> <b>solution</b> composed by two thin layers of Steel Fibre Reinforced Self-Compacting Concrete (SFRSCC) that are connected by thin perforated plates of Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP), used together with a thermal insulation core-layer. The bottom concrete layer is reinforced with conventional steel rebars and steel fibres, whereas the upper one does not have conventional reinforcement. This paper presents a preliminary experimental program aiming to assess the flexural and shear behaviour of this type of <b>sandwich</b> panel <b>solution.</b> The obtained results confirm the feasibility of the proposed sandwich slab system, revealing its capacity in terms of load carrying capacity and ductility performance. In addition, the flexural behaviour of the tested specimens was numerically analysed for the serviceability limit states using the finite element method with consideration of the material non-linearity.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} different structural solutions compared {{under the}} same manoeuvrability and operativity requirements. The structures to be analysed are chosen from an initial set, selected among many solutions which fulfil the dimensional requirements. The airship, in fact, has to be big enough to accommodate a pre-determined volume of payload, has to accommodate the motors in pre-defined locations to allow a good manoeuvrability while limiting the structural deformations, {{must be able to}} house all the systems necessary for its operation and should be able to contain enough volume of helium as to sustain at least the 95 % of the structure weight. To minimize the costs of the structural analysis two configurations has been selected as the most representative of the many configurations proposed: the non-rigid double-hull (Figure 1) and the rigid soap-shape airship (Figure 2). Among the available aeronautical technologies, the aluminium truss and the carbon sandwich structures have been considered for the exoskeleton of the soap-shape airship. On the other hand, the structure of the double-hull is too complex to be realized by standard aluminium components, so only the carbon <b>sandwich</b> <b>solution</b> has been analysed...|$|R
40|$|Obligatory {{standards}} are dictated to vehicle manufacturers for decreasing {{the high number}} of road dead tolls in rollover crashes; at the same time demands to produce light-weight vehicles have increased substantially to reduce the toxic gases emission. This paper presents a new design of the roof strengthening configuration in which sandwich material has been used. This type of configuration improves the energy absorption capacity of the vehicle roof system and dissipates impact energy in a controlled manner. In reality, carrying out roof crush test is not cost effective, thus numerical analysis of vehicle roof crush test has been performed according to standard FMVSS 216 test. Sandwich structures with unidirectional carbon/epoxy composite face-sheets and Expanded Polypropylene (EPP) foam core have been used to model different configurations for vehicle roof structure. The effects of increasing the foam core density and face-sheets thickness on the energy absorption and strength-to-weight ratio (SWR) of vehicle roof structure have been investigated. Results revealed that, the optimized <b>sandwich</b> <b>solution</b> type 6 with the face sheets thickness of 0. 8 mm and foam core of 70 kg/m 3 density reduces the vehicle roof panel mass by 68 % while it has almost the same structural performance with the steel solution having equal value of SWR...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the dynamic {{behaviour}} of an industrial laser cutting equipment a <b>sandwich</b> <b>solution,</b> using a carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) and polyester foam core, was implemented to construct its main runway structural frame, which supports the cutting head and major laser beam mirrors and lens. Nowadays, the commercial competiveness of laser cutting equipments is considerable enhanced by their higher cutting speed and precision, as well as, cost. With the recent available higher power laser beam generators and swifter motors quicker and powerful cuts may be already done. However, at accelerations of 3 and 4 g’s already enabled by linear motors, the lack of stiffness and high mass and consequent inertia of the traditional runway structural frames, made from steel and/or aluminium, do not allow achieving high required cutting precisions. Thus, the present study considered replacing those conventional materials by much lighter advanced CRFP composites to improve the dynamic performance of an existing laser cutting equipment. Advanced numeric Finite Element Method (FEM) calculations by using the ANSYS package software were made to verify the static and dynamic behaviours of the new composite structural frame and compare them to simulations made with the currently used steel solution. The composite structural frame processing method has been also studied and defined in this work. Furthermore, the composite laminate has been optimised by defining the better number of stacking layers and fibre orientations to be used, as well as, the foam core thickness. The failure of the new sandwich structural composite runway frame has been verified through the Tsai-Wu criterion. Finally, an economic analysis of {{the viability of the}} new composite solution adopted will be also presented. Adira, S...|$|R

40|$|Vehicle {{crashworthiness}} {{refers to}} proper designing {{of the vehicle}} structure {{to reduce the risk}} of death and injury during the vehicle accidents. In the recent years, due to the enforcement of new EU normative, the interest of all the car manufacturers in producing lightweight vehicles is progressively increased as the combustion engine optimization has already used most of the improvements they had and the residual ones are becoming more and more difficult and costly. Based on this auto industry's interest, lightweight materials such as composite have absorbed lots of attention due to their superior characteristic of high stiffness to weight ratio. In this thesis, efforts have been made to present a broad research on the light-weight design of vehicle roof panel for stiffness and crash analyses. The first part of the analyses belongs to the vehicle chassis static and dynamic stiffness analyses via the finite element code with the specific focus on substituting the steel roof panel with the lightweight materials of aluminum and composites. The structural response of the vehicle roof panel, made of different solutions, in full frontal crash with respect to NHTSA standard has been investigated at the second step. The effects of increasing the vehicle roof panel thickness at the both steps have been tested and compared for different solutions. At the third step an innovative design solution for the vehicle roof structure has been developed and tested in rollover crash analysis. In order to perform this task, After determining the performance of tubes made of steel, composite and composite foam-filled solutions under the three points bending test and proving the efficiency of composite-foam design; the same idea is implemented on the vehicle roof panel during the roof quasi-static crush test. Besides the composite <b>solutions,</b> the <b>sandwich</b> design consists of composite face-sheets and foam core are tested in the roof crushing test based on the FMVSS 216 standard. After assessment of the sandwich roof panel in crushing test, the geometrical optimization of the foam core is implemented to determine the optimum design with respect to vehicle strength-to-weight ratio and mass reduction percentages. Besides different foam core configurations that have been tested, the final optimization have been implemented using the foam core with various densities and also the optimum face-sheets thickness has been determined. At the last chapter, challenges of vehicle composite roof panel assembly have been discussed. Results in the case of stiffness and frontal crash analyses at step one and step two proved that although the composite solutions have lower energy absorption capacity in comparison with the steel one, they have large contribution to the weight reduction of the vehicle roof panel and still stays in the acceptable range of structural performance. Using the new design of <b>sandwich</b> <b>solutions</b> in roof crushing test have proved that while theses designs have reduced the vehicle roof panel weight by 68 %, they have the same structural performance as the steel solution and could be considered as interesting solutions.

40|$|Orientation by adult {{greenhouse}} whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood) to younger leaves is induced by negative geotaxis and positive phototaxis {{but there is}} a minor effect of features of the leaves. The selection of the lower leaf surface is predominantly the result of a preference for being upside-down (ie. a response to gravity) but leaf characteristics also play a role. Negative phototaxis has a minor effect. Adult females lay more eggs on the younger leaves and on the lower leaf surface of some plant species but not others. Leaf hairiness and leaf angle are not significant factors in selection by adults of either 1) younger leaves or 2) the lower leaf surface nor are they significant factors in the number of eggs/female/day laid on either 1) leaves of different ages or 2) the lower or upper leaf surfaces. Adult survival on sucrose sachets (aqueous sucrose <b>solution</b> <b>sandwiched</b> between two layers of Nescofilm) was optimum for 15 - 20 % sucrose and eggs/female/day laid on the sucrose sachets was independent of sucrose concentration when it was between 10 % and 30 %. Eggs/female/day reached a maximum after 2 - 3 days and thereafter dropped sharply. The number of larvae that hatched was independent of sucrose concentration but higher concentrations appear to induce later hatch. Percent egg hatch varied from 40 % to 77 %.

40|$|Molecularly {{imprinted}} polymer coated {{quartz crystal}} (QCM-MIP) sensors were fabricated {{for the detection}} of "iprodione" in wine and grape juice liquid phases. A set of polymers was templated with iprodione and pyrimethanil to study the imprinting process and the properties of the imprinted and non-imprinted polymers (NIP). The effect of solvent type and ratio, functional monomers (FMs), and templates on the polymer properties was studied. Porogenic solvents produced mesoporous polymers with high surface areas of up to 510 m 2 /g as measured using the BET method. Non-porogen solvents produced macroporous polymers with much lower surface areas between 50 - 150 m 2 /g. Low solvent ratios (~ 5 %) produced glassy polymers with very low surface areas, while high solvent ratios (~ 95 %) produced polymer microspheres. Between the above limits porous polymeric systems are produced. Nitrogen adsor ption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to characterize the morphology and microstructure of the polymers. The comparison of TGA decomposition profiles of the MIPs and NIPs showed higher stability for the MIPs when [sigma-sigma] interaction between the template - FM was utilized in the imprinting process resulting in higher geometrical order due to the [sigma-sigma] stacking. Iprodione had a minimal effect on the EGDMA - MAA polymer system when compared to pyrimethanil. The stronger pyrimethanil - MAA interactions caused the monomers to associate closely around the template in the pre-polymerization solution, and reduces the pore sizes of the EGDMA - MAA polymer to the minimum possible in the mesopore range. It was observed that iprodione leaves stronger imprinting effect when aromatic FMs are used. This effect was maximised using FMs with larger aromatic systems. The stability of the porous system in EGDMA - DVB - 4 VPy polymers was examined at high temperatures, no significant changes were observed based on BJH pore size distribution and FTIR up to 200 °C. It was observed in the iprodione adsorption isotherms studies in model and real solutions that iprodione adsorption is strongly influenced {{by the nature of the}} medium and although imprinting improved the polymers selectivity and capacity, it had smaller role in the adsorption process. The MIP and NIP adsorption thermodynamics clarified the polymer structure heterogeneity showing that imprinting produced larger hydrophobic segments in the polymer network. The EGDMA - DVB - 4 VPy MIP and NIP were applied to QCM using <b>sandwich</b> method. Pre-polymerization <b>solution</b> volumes of 0. 5 - 1 µL were used to produce coatings which caused approximately 2 kHz shift in the QCM resonator frequency, while maintaining a high quality factor.

Wash the magnetically-captured sandwich immune complex-bound Dynabeads® twice by dispensing and sucking back 300 µL of the washing buffer using a 300 µL multi-channel pipette. Thereafter, suspend the washed magnetically-captured sandwich immune complex-bound Dynabeads® in 50 µL of the binding buffer. - 4. Add 100 µL of the TMB-H 2 O 2 mixture to each MTP well and incubate at RT for 4 min to allow the enzymatic reaction to develop color. ?TROUBLESHOOTING - 5. Stop the enzymatic reaction by adding 50 µL of 2 N H 2 SO 4 to each MTP well. - 6. Measure the absorbance at a primary wavelength of 450 nm and 540 nm as the reference wavelength in the Tecan Infinite M 200 Pro microplate reader. CRITICAL STEP Determine the absorbance within 10 min of stopping the enzymatic reaction. ### Troubleshooting ![TABLE 1]([URL] "TABLE 1 ") ### Anticipated Results The developed CRP sandwich ELISA critically reduced the IA assay duration by 12 -fold, from 6 h (commercial CRP sandwich ELISA) to just 30 min, based {{on the use of}} Ab-bound Dynabeads®/MTPs. The developed ELISA is cost-effective and highly-simplified as attested by the minimal process steps and 2. 5 -fold reduced IA components in comparison to the conventional ELISA procedure (Tables S 1, S 2). It detects 0. 3 - 81. 0 ng mL- 1 of CRP with linearity in the range of 1 - 81 ng mL- 1 (Figure 2 A). LOD, analytical sensitivity and correlation coefficient (R 2) are determined to be 0. 4 ng mL- 1, 0. 7 ng mL- 1, and 0. 998, respectively (Table S 2). The intraday and interday variability determined from five assay repeats (in triplicate) in a single day and five consecutive days, respectively, are in the ranges of 0. 7 - 10. 8 and 1. 6 - 11. 2, respectively. The developed ELISA can detect the entire pathophysiological range of hsCRP from 3 - 80 µg mL- 1 in human whole blood and serum after appropriate dilution, as demonstrated by the detection of CRP spiked in diluted whole blood and plasma (Figure 2 A). It has high specificity for CRP, as demonstrated by the use of various experimental process controls (Figure 2 B) that shows no detectable interference with the immunological reagents. The optimum duration for the formation of the sandwich immune complex by the one-step kinetics-based procedure is 15 min, while the optimum number of magnet-assisted washings thereafter is only two (Figure S 1). The developed and conventional sandwich ELISAs have the same analytical precision for the detection of CRP in diluted whole blood and serum as the results are in agreement with each other (Table 2). The percentage recovery for the CRP-spiked diluted human whole blood is in the range of 93. 3 - 107. 0 and 94. 0 - 103. 3 for the developed and conventional sandwich ELISAs, respectively. Similarly, the percentage recovery for CRP-spiked diluted human serum ranges from 103. 3 - 108. 0, compared to 93. 3 - 113. 0 for the developed and conventional sandwich ELISAs, respectively. The results obtained for the detection of CRP in the EDTA plasma samples of patients by the developed ELISA are also in good agreement with those obtained by the conventional ELISA (Table 3). The anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads® can be stored for more than 4 months at 4 ºC without compromising the CRP detection response (Figure 2 C). The production variability for the preparation of anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads®, using the same lots of Dynabeads® and anti-CRP capture Ab, is less than 3 percent (Figure 2 D). Moreover, the developed ELISA using SA-HRP/biotinylated anti-CRP Ab conjugate is similar to the variant of the developed ELISA procedure that employs the two-step binding of biotinylated anti-CRP Ab and SA-HRP (Figure S 2 A). The one-step kinetics-based <b>sandwich</b> ELISA <b>solution</b> (comprising anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads® and biotinylated anti-CRP detection Ab preconjugated to SA-HRP, stored at 4 ºC in BSA-preblocked MTPs) exhibited no noticeable decrease in its functional activity for up to 4 weeks (Figure S 2 B). Therefore, taking into account the attributes of the developed generic sandwich ELISA procedure, it can be reliably employed in clinical and bioanalytical settings. Moreover, it has immense potential for the development of novel and fully automated rapid IVD kits in combination with lab-on-a-chip technologies, microfluidics, nanotechnology and smart system integration. ### Figures **Figure 1 : Schematic of the protocol** ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") One-step kinetics-based sandwich ELISA procedure for the rapid detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) (48).
