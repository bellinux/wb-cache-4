5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{is good for}} stable lesions (stageI and II) in juveniles with open growth plates; treated conservatively—typically without surgery—50% of cases will heal. Recovery in juveniles {{can be attributed to}} the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. Open growth plates are characterized by increased numbers of undifferentiated chondrocytes (<b>stem</b> <b>cells)</b> which are precursors to both bone and cartilaginous tissue. As a result, open growth plates allow for more of the <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> necessary for repair in the affected joint. Unstable, large, full-thickness lesions (stageIII and IV) or lesions of any stage found in the skeletally mature are more likely to fail non-operative treatment. These lesions offer a worse prognosis and surgery is required in most cases.|$|E
5|$|Turning Urine Samples into Brain Cells: This new {{technique}} of reprogramming ordinary cells present in urine into immature brain cells that can form multiple types of functioning neurons and glial cells {{was developed by}} Chinese researchers in China, and {{was published in the}} scientific journal Nature Methods in December 2012. Instead of using retrovirus, they used vectors which the researchers say is a breakthrough This does not involve embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> which come with serious drawbacks when transplanted, such as the risk of developing tumours. This technique makes the procedure of generating Induced pluripotent <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> far easier and non-invasive, as the cells can be obtained from a urine sample instead of a blood sample or biopsy. This research proves human excreta could be a powerful source of cells to study disease, bypassing some of the problems of using <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> and could be useful for research studying the cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and for testing the effects of new drugs that are being developed to treat them.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921 is {{considered among the}} most significant events {{in the history of}} medicine. The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> including the identification of pancreatic and retinal <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> The cancer stem cell was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers, who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer. Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the glycaemic index, the infant cereal Pablum, the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial cardiac pacemaker. The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988, and the first double-lung transplant in 1989. Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the T cell receptor, which triggers responses of the immune system. The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis. Among the research conducted at the laboratory was the development of gel electrophoresis.|$|E

25|$|<b>Stem</b> <b>cells</b> are {{characterized}} by their ability to self-renew for a prolonged time and still maintain the ability to differentiate along one or more cell lineages. <b>Stem</b> <b>cells</b> may be unipotent, multipotent, or pluripotent, meaning they can differentiate into one, multiple, or all cell types, respectively. Pluripotent <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> can become cells derived {{from any of the}} three embryonic germ layers. <b>Stem</b> <b>cells</b> have the advantage over glial cells because they are able to proliferate more easily in culture. However, it remains difficult to preferentially differentiate these cells into varied cell types in an ordered manner. Another difficulty with <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> is the lack of a well-defined definition of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> beyond hematopoietic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (HSCs). Each stem cell 'type' has more than one method for identifying, isolating, and expanding the cells; this has caused much confusion because all <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> of a 'type' (neural, mesenchymal, retinal) do not necessarily behave in the same manner under identical conditions.|$|E

In adult organisms, <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and progenitor cells act as a repair system for the body, replenishing adult tissues. In a developing embryo, <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> can differentiate into all the specialized cells—ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm (see induced pluripotent stem cells)—but also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative organs, such as blood, skin, or intestinal tissues.|$|E

Molecular and functional differences between these two <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> types demonstrate that the tissue of origin and/or the growth factor milieu may be important determinants of the <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> identity. We explored how developmental stage of the tissue of origin and culture growth factor conditions affect the <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> pluripotent state. Our findings indicate that novel <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> lines, with unique functional and molecular properties, can be generated from murine blastocyst embryos.
