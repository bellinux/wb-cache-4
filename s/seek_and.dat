5|$|After construction, Morris invited {{friends to}} visit, most notably Burne-Jones {{and his wife}} Georgiana, as well as Rossetti and his wife Lizzie Siddal. They aided him in {{painting}} murals on the furniture, walls, and ceilings, much of it based on Arthurian tales, the Trojan War, and Geoffrey Chaucer's stories, while he also designed floral embroideries for the rooms. They also spent much time playing tricks on each other, enjoying games like hide and <b>seek,</b> <b>and</b> singing while accompanied by the piano. Siddall stayed at the House during summer and autumn 1861 as she recovered from a traumatic miscarriage and an addiction to laudanum; she would die of an overdose in February 1862.|$|E

Marceline, in her evil demon form, listens to the requests of her subjects, often ignoring what they <b>seek</b> <b>and</b> instead punishing them with macabre torture. Finn and Jake are spotted by Marceline, who gives chase. After narrowly avoiding their demonic friend, the duo run into the now-benign Hunson Abadeer, who explains that he only wanted Marceline to follow in his footsteps and rule the hellish realm.|$|E

40|$|Interaction between {{information}} <b>seeking</b> <b>and</b> learning - a {{study of}} the relation between two phenomena The article presents findings from a dissertation research project aimed at investigating the interaction between students' information <b>seeking</b> <b>and</b> use and the learning outcomes of an assignment. Theoretical frames were found in LIS user studies and in learning research. Phenomenographic method, designed to investigate variation in people's ways of experiencing phenomena in the world, was used. Three major ways of experiencing information <b>seeking</b> <b>and</b> use were identified and described. The findings suggest a clear relationship between variation in the experience of information <b>seeking</b> <b>and</b> use and qualitative differences in learning outcomes. A discussion of implications for professional practice as well as for further research concludes the article.

5|$|From Dust {{is a god}} video game, {{designed}} by Éric Chahi and developed by Ubisoft Montpellier. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Arcade in 2011. Described as a spiritual successor to Populous, the game revolves around The Breath, which was summoned by a tribe to help them <b>seek</b> <b>and</b> recover their lost knowledge. In the game, players, controlling a cursor, can manipulate matter such as lava, soil, and water. Players can help the tribespeople to overcome challenges including finding different totems and overcoming natural disasters. In addition to the story mode, the game features a Challenge mode which offers a shorter, but harder experience.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} apparent to U.S. planners that, {{in a military}} confrontation with Warsaw Pact forces, NATO aircraft would quickly suffer heavy losses. This came {{as a result of}} sophisticated Soviet defense networks, which used surveillance radars and radar-guided surface-to-air missiles (SAM) and anti-aircraft artillery to <b>seek</b> <b>and</b> eliminate enemy aircraft. Consequently, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) started a study on low-observability aircraft, seeking to design and produce an operational stealth aircraft. Five companies were initially invited, three of which bowed out early. The remaining two were later joined by Lockheed.|$|E

5|$|In the Malaysian case Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan (1996), the {{appellant}} had appealed {{against his}} wrongful dismissal from employment {{on the grounds}} of procedural unfairness. One of the issues brought up was whether an unfair procedure meant that he had been deprived of his constitutional right to life or liberty protected by Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram held that the courts should take into consideration the unique characteristics and situation of the country, and must not be blind to the realities of life. He went on to suggest that a liberal approach be adopted to grasp the intention of the framers of the Constitution by giving life a broad and liberal meaning. He opined that such an interpretation would include elements that form the quality of life, namely the right to <b>seek</b> <b>and</b> be engaged in lawful and gainful employment, and the right to live in a reasonably healthy and pollution-free environment. He also noted that life cannot be extinguished or taken away except according to procedure established by law.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century, {{northern}} India, being then under mainly Muslim rulers, fell {{again to the}} superior mobility and firepower {{of a new generation}} of Central Asian warriors. The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status. The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency, caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets. The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion, resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture. Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience. Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India. As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to <b>seek</b> <b>and</b> control their own affairs.|$|E
5|$|At the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Criterion Games' {{director}} of design Alex Ward {{was approached by}} Bruce McMillan, executive vice president at EA Worldwide Studios. McMillan wanted to reconcile EA's relationship with Criterion and partner with them on a game. Initially, Ward refused, citing their past experience {{of working with the}} publisher. However, EA persisted and suggested Criterion make Burnout 3 with them. Originally, the studio was waiting until the next generation of video game hardware launched before starting work on a third instalment. Criterion accepted the deal on the conditions that EA would not interfere with the game's development and that Criterion had the freedom to create the game they wanted. Development on Burnout 3 began immediately after the expo in June 2003, with a larger team of staff working on the game than its predecessors. By January 2004, Criterion had a build of the game ready to demonstrate to EA. The development team had drafted a number of subtitles for Burnout 3 including Fuel Injection, Crash and Burn, <b>Seek</b> <b>and</b> Destroy, Takedown along with some more ridiculous suggestions like See You in Hell. Internally, they felt that Takedown was not an appealing choice, however the outcome of EA's focus testing proved otherwise. Despite a rocky start in their relationship with EA, Criterion admitted to benefiting from the publisher's experience throughout the course of Burnout 3s development. By July 2004, development on the game was nearly complete with the remaining work confined to bug testing and polishing the experience. On 28 July 2004, EA announced that they had acquired Criterion along with the Burnout intellectual property. McMillan stated that their strong expectations for Burnout 3 and ownership of the series were key reasons for buying Criterion.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{investigate}} the expressions of collaborative activities within information <b>seeking</b> <b>and</b> retrieval processes (IS&R). Generally, information <b>seeking</b> <b>and</b> retrieval is regarded as an individual and isolated process in IR research. We assume that an IS&R situation is not merely an individual effort, but inherently involves various collaborative activities. We present empirical results from a real-life and information-intensive setting within the patent domain, showing that the patent task performance process involves highly collaborative aspects throughout the stages of the information <b>seeking</b> <b>and</b> retrieval process. Furthermore, we show that these activities may be categorised and related to different stages in an information <b>seeking</b> <b>and</b> retrieval process. Therefore, the assumption that information retrieval performance is purely individual needs to be reconsidered. Finally, we also propose a refined IR framework involving collaborative aspects...|$|R
40|$|Sensation <b>seeking</b> <b>and</b> impulsivity are {{personality}} traits that are correlated with risk for antisocial behavior (ASB). This paper uses two independent samples of twins to (a) test {{the extent to}} which sensation <b>seeking</b> <b>and</b> impulsivity statistically mediate genetic influence on ASB, and (b) compare this to genetic influences accounted for by other {{personality traits}}. In Sample 1, delinquent behavior, as well as impulsivity, sensation <b>seeking</b> <b>and</b> Big Five personality traits, were measured in adolescent twins from the Texas Twin Project. In Sample 2, adult twins from the Australian Twin Registry responded to questionnaires that assessed individual differences in Eysenck's and Cloninger's personality dimensions, and a structured telephone interview that asked participants to retrospectively report DSM-de- fined symptoms of conduct disorder. Bivariate quantitative genetic models were used to identify genetic overlap between personality traits and ASB. Across both samples, novelty/sensation <b>seeking</b> <b>and</b> impulsive traits accounted for larger portions of genetic variance in ASB than other personality traits. We discuss whether sensation <b>seeking</b> <b>and</b> impulsive personality are causal endophenotypes for ASB, or merely index genetic liability for ASB...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. This paper {{shows how}} the set of Information <b>Seeking</b> <b>and</b> Retrieval (information <b>seeking</b> <b>and</b> retrieval) topics (for devising a {{curriculum}}) relates to the curriculum of two modules taught at two different institutions: Department of Library and Information Science and Book Studies at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia and School of Information and Library Studies at University College Dublin, Ireland. Method. The information <b>seeking</b> <b>and</b> retrieval framework is compared to the structure and contents of both courses. Analysis. This is a descriptive paper and no statistical methods were used. Results. Although differing {{in the time of}} their existence and in amount of student effort, some parallels to the information <b>seeking</b> <b>and</b> retrieval scheme can be drawn in both modules. Both modules place heavy emphasis on basic concepts in Human Information Behaviour <b>and</b> Information <b>Seeking</b> areas, while topics predominantly those belonging to the Information Retrieval area are omitted in both modules. Conclusions. These findings have implications for curriculum development. It is possible to claim that the list of information <b>seeking</b> <b>and</b> retrieval topics is fairly robust and that it provides a useful reference tool for educators concerned with curriculum development...|$|R
