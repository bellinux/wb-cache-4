The {{construction}} of the facade by architect Juan Gutiérrez Toribio led a <b>step</b> <b>surface</b> that was called Lonja de San Felipe. Gathered the Madrid's inhabitants in this area to exchange news, rumors, calumnies, inventions, secrets and opinions. For this reason it was called [...] "mentidero" [...] of Madrid. The steps of San Felipe (Las Gradas de San Felipe) was also a gathering place to recruit soldiers destined to the Spanish Netherlands during the War of Flanders. One day, due to the weight caused by the crush of people gathered on it to witness the prison of a reprobate, the balcony of the lonja sank. The accident caused many deaths and injuries.|$|E
5000|$|Around May 1895, Charles Seeberger began {{drawings}} on {{a form of}} escalator {{similar to}} those patented by Wheeler in 1892. This device consisted of flat, moving stairs, not unlike the escalators of today, except for one important detail: the <b>step</b> <b>surface</b> was smooth, with no comb effect to safely guide the rider's feet off at the ends. Instead, the passenger had to step off sideways. To facilitate this, at the top or bottom of the escalator the steps continued moving horizontally beyond {{the end of the}} handrail (like a miniature moving sidewalk) until they disappeared under a triangular [...] "divider" [...] which guided the passenger to either side. Seeberger teamed with Otis in 1899, and together they produced the first commercial escalator. It won first prize at the 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle. Also on display at the Exposition were Reno's inclined elevator, a similar model by James M. Dodge and the Link Belt Machinery Co., and two different devices by the French manufacturers Hallé and Piat.|$|E

In this paper, we study the action of these dual maps on particular discrete planes and <b>surfaces,</b> namely <b>stepped</b> planes and <b>stepped</b> <b>surfaces.</b> We show that dual maps {{can be seen as}} discretizations of toral automorphisms. We then provide a connection between stepped planes and the Brun multi-dimensional continued fraction algorithm, based on a desubstitution process defined on local geometric configurations of stepped planes.

40|$|The {{nucleation}} of graphene on Ni surface, {{as well as}} on the step, is studied using a {{tight binding}} method of SCC-DFTB. The result demonstrates that the fcc configuration has the lowest total energy and thus is the most stable one compared to the other two structures when benzene ring is absorbed on the Ni(111) surface. The activity of marginal growth graphene's carbon atoms decreases from the boundary to the center, when they are absorbed on the substrate. Graphene layer can grow continuously on <b>step</b> <b>surface</b> formed by intersection of Ni(111) and Ni(1 - 11) surface. Meanwhile, a mismatch will occur between the layer and Ni surface and thus leads to flaws when the layer grows larger.

We demonstrated by simulation that diffraction from <b>stepped</b> <b>surface</b> is sensitive to interface. We prepared high quality <b>stepped</b> <b>surfaces</b> of SrTiO 3 and observed characteristics of <b>stepped</b> <b>surface</b> of SrTiO 3 by three different methods.

We present {{theoretical}} {{studies of}} relaxations of monoatomic SA, SB(b) and SB(n) {{steps on the}} diamond(100) -(2 × 1) surface employing an ab initio molecular dynamics simulation method {{that is based on}} density functional theory.

40|$|The {{hydroxylation}} structural {{features of}} the first adsorption layer and its connection to proton transfer reactivity have been studied for the ZnO-liquid water interface at room temperature. Molecular dynamics simulations employing the ReaxFF forcefield were performed for water on seven ZnO <b>surfaces</b> with varying <b>step</b> concentrations. At higher water coverage {{a higher level of}} hydroxylation was found, in agreement with previous experimental results. We have also calculated the free energy barrier for transferring a proton to the <b>surface,</b> showing that <b>stepped</b> <b>surfaces</b> stabilize the hydroxylated state and decrease the water dissociation barrier. On highly <b>stepped</b> <b>surfaces</b> the barrier is only 2 kJ/mol or smaller. Outside the first adsorption layer no dissociation events were found during almost 100 ns of simulation time; this indicates that these reactions are much more likely if catalyzed by the metal oxide surface.

50|$|There {{have been}} various {{attempts}} at defining the subset of surfaces that compose the paleic surface in southern Norway. Geomorphologist Karna Lidmar-Bergström and co-workers recognize five widespread <b>stepped</b> <b>surfaces.</b> However, not all steps can be fitted into the five-step scheme, {{perhaps due to}} local doming. On eastern Norway some of the <b>stepped</b> <b>surfaces</b> merge into a single surface. In south-western Norway the Paleic surface is strongly dissected by valleys and fjords. Dovre and Jotunheimen are residual mountains rising from the highest of the <b>stepped</b> <b>surfaces.</b> These mountains define a former envelope surface that is warped. Possibly the warping of the envelope surface reflects doming of the crust associated with the uplift of the Scandinavian Mountains in the Cenozoic. The Paleic surface has been reconstructed over the fjord area of western Norway. In the reconstructed paleic surface’s very gentle valleys follow the same course as Sognefjord, Hardangerfjord, Gudbrandsdalen and Østerdalen, but not of other valleys and fjords of western Norway.|$|R

In order to facilitate the microcharacterization of polytype stuctures, polarized micro-Raman spectra of Orth II/Mon overgrowth crystals have been investigated in the low-frequency region below about 30 cm- 1. It was observed some growth spiral steps of OrthII on onesided surface of the overgrowth crystals after 9 hours at 23 ℃ in the saturated n-hexane solution. Polarized micro-Raman spectra of all observation points on the <b>step</b> <b>surface</b> of the overgrowth crystals at 23 ℃ and 25 ℃ indicated the characteristic bands belonging to Orth II polytype, the bands at 21. 0 cm- 1 and 6. 9 cm- 1 in the c(a, b) c polarization.

While it holds true for closed <b>stepped</b> <b>surfaces</b> it does not apply for more open surfaces such as for Cu(320) and Cu(410). For example, we found relaxation sequences like [...] +-. for both surfaces, instead of the expected [...] +-. and [...] -+-., respectively. The - and + signs indicate contraction and expansion, respectively, of the interlayer spacing.
