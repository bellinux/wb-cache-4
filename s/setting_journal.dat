Adverse events such as congestive heart failure and life threatening diarrhoea are sometimes observed because of off-target drug effects. In this article, we discuss the incidence, prevention and management of serious adverse events associated with trastuzumab, lapatinib, and bevacizumab.

40|$|Through {{the use of}} {{surrogate}} markers of efficacy, neoadjuvant studies may facilitate the implementation of new treatments into clinical practice. However, disease-free survival is the current standard outcome endpoint for registration of a novel treatment. The coupling of smaller neoadjuvant 'proof of principle' studies with larger adjuvant registration trials offers the promise of speeding up the time to market of new therapies. Clever new designs, such as the 'biological window' and 'learn on the way', can provide valuable insight regarding mechanisms of action and resistance of these novel drugs by identifying patients {{who are most likely}} to respond to a novel therapy early in the drug development process.

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) synthesis {{is known}} {{to play a major}} part in numerous inflammatory disorders, and multiple transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms have therefore evolved to dampen the production of this key proinflammatory cytokine. The high expression of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), an enzyme involved in the nicotinamide-dependent NAD biosynthetic pathway, in cells of the immune system has led us to examine the potential relationship between NAD metabolism and inflammation. We show here that intracellular NAD concentration promotes TNF synthesis by activated immune cells. Using a positive screen, we have identified Sirt 6, a member of the sirtuin family, as the NAD-dependent enzyme able to regulate TNF production by acting at a post-transcriptional step. These studies reveal a previously undescribed relationship between metabolism and the inflammatory response and identify Sirt 6 and the nicotinamide-dependent NAD biosynthetic pathway as novel candidates for immunointervention in an inflammatory <b>setting.</b> <b>Journal</b> ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of models with limited-dependent variables has allowed researchers to test important relationships in political science.

Contrary to the linear model, such misclassifications affect not only the estimate of the intercept but also those of the other coefficients.

This laboratory study was designed to investigate the mechanical characteristics of nine current fixation systems. A programme of loading was devised to mimic forces acting on the distal radius. Wooden dowel was used to mount the fixator. Distraction and compression forces were applied in an In&on rig. Displacement was monitored throughout the load programme. No fixator failed at the loads tested. The small Hoffman rectangular frame proved stiffest in compression and extension, but was heavier than other devices. A trend of progressive, permanent deformation became apparent in those fixators which contain plastic or composite materials.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of hypertension {{continues to rise}} across the world, and most patients who receive medical intervention are not adequately treated to goal. A Working Group including representatives of nine international health-care organizations was convened to review the barriers to more effective blood pressure control and propose actions to address them. The group concluded that tackling the global challenge of hypertension will require partnerships among multiple constituencies, including patients, health-care professionals, industry, media, health-care educators, health planners and governments. Additionally, health-care professionals will need to act locally with renewed impetus to improve blood pressure goal rates. The Working Group identified five core actions, which should be rigorously implemented by practitioners and targeted by health systems throughout the world: (1) detect and prevent high blood pressure; (2) assess total cardiovascular risk; (3) form an active partnership with the patient; (4) treat hypertension to goal and (5) create a supportive environment.

40|$|Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is a {{recently}} discovered virus that is {{implicated in the}} oncogenesis of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). The route of dissemination and the reservoir(s) of MCPyV within the human body {{have not yet been}} identified. In this study we describe two patients with multiple MCPyV-positive inflammatory and neoplastic skin lesions at different anatomic sites. Patient 1 was suffering from psoriasis for many years and was diagnosed with MCC 7 years before this study. Patient 2 had developed numerous non-melanoma skin cancer lesions under post-transplant immunosuppression. In both patients, MCPyV DNA was detected in whole blood and in urine using PCR and direct sequencing of PCR products. When we analyzed different blood compartments, we found MCPyV exclusively in cell-free serum and in blood monocytes, but not in lymphocytes or granulocytes. Upon separate analysis of resident (CD 14 (lo) CD 16 (+)) and inflammatory (CD 14 (+) CD 16 (-)) monocytes, we detected MCPyV exclusively in inflammatory, but not in resident monocytes. Our findings raise the possibility that MCPyV persists in inflammatory monocytes and spreads along the migration routes of inflammatory monocytes. This points to intervention strategies to contain MCPyV. Moreover, blood or urine tests may serve as ancillary tests to confirm MCPyV infection in a clinical <b>setting.</b> <b>Journal</b> of Investigative Dermatology advance online publication, 17 December 2009; doi: 10. 1038 /jid. 2009. 392...|$|E
