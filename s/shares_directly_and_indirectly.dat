5000|$|March 26, Fortis Bank Nederland {{announced}} {{a loss of}} €18.5 billion from 2008 (separate from the €22.5 billion loss projected by its former mother-company Fortis), mostly because of a €17.7 billion write-off on ABN-AMRO; it booked an operational profit of €0.6 billion (excluding write-offs). As the court is now obliged to address its mail to all the (circa 2400) shareholders represented by Modrikamen separately, it checked all the addresses {{and came up with}} several dozen errors, including two persons who are deceased. Responding to a rumor (by Modrikamen) that it had bought up to 9% of the Fortis shares, so as to vote on the upcoming meeting of shareholders, BNP Baribas {{let it be known that}} it controlled 0.35% voting <b>shares</b> (<b>directly</b> <b>and</b> <b>indirectly)</b> and that daughter-companies held a further 0.23%, which however it did not control, as they would vote independently.|$|E
40|$|The role of Civil Society Organisations as {{preferred}} {{partners in}} development is strongly emerging across the globe. Among many reasons, one is reasonably good governance. The social sector {{has shown the}} acumen to learn and apply corporate management practices and international standards fast enough to start leading the competition. Notwithstanding {{the fact that a}} large part of development funding under soft loans and grants is channeled to the government, the CSOs receive a significant <b>share</b> <b>directly</b> <b>and</b> <b>indirectly</b> to implement development projects in communities. It has opened tremendous opportunities for CSOs to experiment and evolve new approaches in project management, community organisation, service delivery, product development, resource mobilisation and financial management. What makes the civil society organisations different from the public sector organisations? Fundamentally two things; these are non-governmental and nonprofit. However, the real difference is in the way civil society organisations are managed. It includes leadership, commitment, professionalism, systems and practices, thrust of work and most of all performance. ...|$|R

40|$|This study proposes {{and tests}} {{a model of}} {{knowledge}} sharing within PVCs that incorporates the role of moderatorship and social identities. First, we conceptualize, operationalize, and empirically support moderatorship as a construct with three attributes: support, fairness and competent engagement. Second, we find that moderatorship enhances knowledge <b>sharing</b> intention <b>directly</b> <b>and</b> <b>indirectly</b> through community identification. Third, professional identity does not only positively relate to knowledge <b>sharing</b> <b>directly,</b> but also indirectly via community identification. Finally, professional identity also moderates the effect of moderatorship in that moderatorship exerts a stronger effect on knowledge sharing for those with weaker professional identity...|$|R

The daily banking {{operation}} and ownership were split into a società per azioni and Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Alessandria in 1991. Istituto Mobiliare Italiano also subscribed the capital increase of the bank for 23 billion lire (15.330 billion lire increase in share capital), owning 11.33% stake after the deal. In 1995, the bank was merged with the saving banks (Cassa di Risparmio) from Spezia and Carrara to form [...] "Carinord Holding" [...] (acronym of Ca.Ri. North), which the former owners of the banks (the foundations) as well as Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde (Cariplo) were the new shareholders of the holding company, despite the three banks remains as separate subsidiaries. In 2002 CR Alessandria was {{break away from the}} union, which Foundation CR Alessandria and Cariplo were the major shareholders of the bank (80%) through [...] "Carinord 1 SpA", a 50-50 joint venture. The foundation held 20% directly, thus held 60% <b>shares</b> <b>directly</b> <b>and</b> <b>indirectly</b> in total. In 2003 Intesa Sanpaolo (ex-Cariplo) sold its shares on the bank to Banca Popolare di Milano. At the same time the foundation held a minority shares of Banca Popolare di Milano and some of its subsidiaries, as well as retained the 20% shares on CR Alessandria. On 11 February 2012 the bank was absorbed by Banca di Legnano, a wholly owned subsidiary of Banca Popolare di Milano, despite Banca di Legnano was absorbed also in 2013.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{reports on}} the results of an {{empirical}} investigation of the factors that affect timely annual financial reporting practices by 95 non-financial, group companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange. A descriptive analysis indicates that 92 % of the companies reported early (relative to the 161 -day regulatory deadline), 3 % reported on the 161 st day and 5 % reported late. A multivariate regression analysis suggests that large companies, service companies and companies audited by the former Big- 5 audit firms have shorter final reporting lead-time. Our tests provide strong empirical evidence to suggest, however, that companies in the construction sector, companies whose audit reports were qualified and companies that had a greater proportion of their equity <b>shares</b> <b>directly</b> <b>and</b> <b>indirectly</b> held by insiders do not promptly release their audited financial statements. No empirical evidence was found in support of the monitoring cost theory. Policy implications of the results for the regulatory agency of the stock market are suggested. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} {{of an employee}} is an important resource for the organisation {{and it is very}} vital for companies that employees share their knowledge. Knowledge sharing cannot happen easily, as it is an individual choice and can’t be forced. Previous studies have shown that organisational trust is a backbone of knowledge sharing behaviour. In this study, the new conceptual framework proposes drawing the relationship between factors that are influencing organisational trust and testing the relationships between organisational trust and knowledge sharing behaviour with a moderating effect of Multigenerational employees. This framework classified the most significant factors that influence knowledge <b>sharing</b> behaviour, both <b>directly</b> <b>and</b> <b>indirectly,</b> through an organisational trust. The research model of this study is built from an extensive review on the literature of knowledge management, organisational behaviour, sociology, phycology, trust, and management studies. Since there are very few in-depth studies specifically on trust and knowledge sharing in Malaysia, research on trust from an organisational perspective was consulted. This body of research has numerous and valuable studies on trust in organisations that assisted in helping to understand how trust develops knowledge sharing behaviour within an organisation’s structure in general. Moreover, how it applies to an organisation among different age groups. This study provides methodological contributions in the form of conceptualisations for organisational trust and knowledge sharing behaviour; in addition, it provides extra emphasis on analysis, by identifying the dimensions of knowledge sharing behaviour and organisational trust...|$|R
