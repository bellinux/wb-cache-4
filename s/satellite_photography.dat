500|$|Baxter {{notes that}} Barry Lyndon was the film which made Kubrick notorious for paying scrupulous {{attention}} to detail, often demanding {{twenty or thirty}} retakes of the same scene to perfect his art. Often considered to be his most authentic-looking picture, [...] the cinematography and lighting techniques that Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott used in Barry Lyndon were highly innovative. Most notably, interior scenes were shot with a specially adapted high-speed f/0.7 Zeiss camera lens originally developed for NASA {{to be used in}} <b>satellite</b> <b>photography.</b> The lenses allowed many scenes to be lit only with candlelight, creating two-dimensional, diffused-light images reminiscent of 18th-century paintings. Cinematographer Allen Daviau states that the method gives the audience a way of seeing the characters and scenes as they would have been seen by people at the time. Many of the fight scenes were shot with a hand-held camera to produce a [...] "sense of documentary realism and immediacy".|$|E

2500|$|Low {{clouds are}} found from near surface up to [...] [...] Genus types in this level either have no prefix or carry one {{that refers to}} a {{characteristic}} other than altitude. [...] Clouds that form in {{the low level of}} the troposphere are generally of larger structure than those that form in the middle and high levels, so they can usually be identified by their forms and genus types using <b>satellite</b> <b>photography</b> alone.|$|E
2500|$|Non-vertical {{clouds in}} the middle level are prefixed by alto-, {{yielding}} the genus names altocumulus (Ac) and altostratus (As). These clouds can form as low as [...] above surface at any latitude, but may be based as high as [...] near the poles, [...] at mid latitudes, and [...] in the tropics. [...] As with high clouds, {{it is not possible}} to distinguish between individual forms or genera using <b>satellite</b> <b>photography</b> alone. [...] Without the support of human observations, these clouds are usually collectively identified as middle-type on satellite images.|$|E
2500|$|These clouds {{have low}} to middle level bases that form {{anywhere}} from near surface to about [...] and tops that can extend {{into the high}} altitude range. [...] Nimbostratus and some cumulus in this group usually achieve moderate or deep vertical extent, but without towering structure. [...] However, with sufficient airmass instability, upward-growing cumuliform clouds can grow to high towering proportions. [...] Although genus types with vertical extent are often informally considered a single group, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) distinguishes towering vertical clouds more formally as a separate group or sub-group. [...] It is specified that these very large cumuliform and cumulonimbiform types must be identified by their standard names or abbreviations in all aviation observations (METARS) and forecasts (TAFS) to warn pilots of possible severe weather and turbulence. [...] Multi-level clouds are of even larger structure than low clouds, and are therefore identifiable by their forms and genera, (and even species {{in the case of}} cumulus congestus) using <b>satellite</b> <b>photography.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{grove of}} 5,000 trees {{planted on the}} proving grounds in 1937, {{spelling}} out the Studebaker name, still stands and {{has proven to be}} a popular topic on such <b>satellite</b> <b>photography</b> sites as Google Earth. The proving grounds were acquired by Bendix in 1966 and Bosch in 1996. After Bosch closed its South Bend operation in 2011, a part of the proving ground was retained and, , has been restored to use under the name [...] "New Carlisle Test Facility". For many years a rumor persisted of a Studebaker graveyard. The rumor was later confirmed to be fact when the remains of many Studebaker prototype automobiles and a few trucks were discovered at a remote site within the confines of the former Studebaker proving grounds. A few of the prototypes were rescued and are in private collections. The only example of a never-produced wood-sided Champion station wagon has been restored and is on display at the Studebaker National Museum. Most of the prototypes were left to rot in direct contact with the ground and full exposure to the weather and falling trees. Attempts to remove some of these rusting bodies resulted in the bodies crumbling under their own weight as they were moved, so now they exist only in photographs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} earth {{science and the}} history of {{astrophysics}} were also closely tied to military purposes and funding throughout the Cold War. [...] American geodesy, oceanography, and seismology grew from small sub-disciplines in into full-fledged independent disciplines as for several decades, virtually all funding in these fields came from the Department of Defense. [...] A central goal that tied these disciplines together (even while providing the means for intellectual independence) was the figure of the Earth, the model of the earthâ€™s geography and gravitation that was essential for accurate ballistic missiles. [...] In the 1960s, geodesy was the superficial goal of the satellite program CORONA, while military reconnaissance was in fact a driving force. [...] Even for geodetic data, new secrecy guidelines worked to restrict collaboration in a field that had formerly been fundamentally international; the Figure of the Earth had geopolitical significance beyond questions of pure geoscience. [...] Still, geodesists were able to retain enough autonomy and subvert secrecy limitations enough {{to make use of the}} findings of their military research to overturn some of the fundamental theories of geodesy. [...] Like geodesy and <b>satellite</b> <b>photography</b> research, the advent of radio astronomy had a military purpose hidden beneath official astrophysical research agenda. [...] Quantum electronics permitted both revolutionary new methods of analyzing the universe andusing the same equipment and technologythe monitoring of Soviet electronic signals.|$|E
