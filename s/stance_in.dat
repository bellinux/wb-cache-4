The next year, Dalassenos repeated his raids against Tripoli, Rafaniya, Awgh, and al-Lakma, capturing the latter. At the same time, the inhabitants of Tyre, {{under the leadership of}} a sailor named Allaqa, rose up in revolt against the Fatimids and requested Byzantine assistance; further south, in Palestine, the Bedouin leader Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah attacked Ramlah.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} term as governor, in 1906, Beckham made a bid to become a U.S. senator. His <b>stance</b> <b>in</b> favor of {{prohibition}} cost him the votes of four legislators {{in his own party}} and the General Assembly gave the seat to Republican William O. Bradley, who had been governor in 1895-99. Six years later Beckham secured the seat by popular election, but he lost his re-election bid in 1920 largely because of his pro-temperance views and his opposition to women's suffrage. Though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades, he never returned to elected office, failing in his gubernatorial bid in 1927 and his senatorial campaign in 1936. He died in Louisville on January 9, 1940.|$|E

This stance on the landmark Citizens United case caused considerable disagreement within the organization, resulting in a discussion about its future stance during a quarterly board meeting in 2010. On March 27, 2012, the ACLU reaffirmed its <b>stance</b> <b>in</b> support of the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling, at the same time voicing support for expanded public financing of election campaigns and stating the organization would firmly oppose any future constitutional amendment limiting free speech.|$|E

Following the decision to build the runway, Goldsmith stood-down as MP for Richmond Park, triggering a by-election, in which Goldsmith stood as an independent candidate. On 1 December 2016, Goldsmith, was defeated in the by-election by Sarah Olney of the Liberal Democrats, with Goldsmith's loss put down to his <b>stance</b> <b>in</b> favour of Britain's exit from the European Union.|$|E
5|$|Plans to {{construct}} a road from Brawley to Glamis date from 1953; the road would provide improved access to two newer state parks. The ceding of the Chocolate Mountains to the U.S. Navy had closed a north–south road traversing Imperial County, and the government needed to restore a corridor for local residents to use, as the road was closed during the day for five days a week. However, in August, the Riverside Chamber of Commerce opposed the construction, even though it would replace the Niland–Blythe road. The chamber reversed its <b>stance</b> <b>in</b> December, as the road would mostly be constructed in Imperial County.|$|E

In 1762, when Catherine ascended to the Russian throne, she sent him several letters professing her support for his ascension to the Polish throne, but asking him {{to stay away from}} St. Petersburg. Nevertheless, Poniatowski hoped that Catherine would consider marriage, an idea that was seen as plausible by some international observers. He was involved with the unrealized plans of the Familia for a coup d'état against Augustus III.

5|$|The Great New York City Fire of 1845 was {{the last}} of three {{particularly}} devastating fires that affected the heart of Manhattan, the other two occurring in 1776 and 1835. While very destructive, the 1845 fire confirmed the value of building codes restricting wood-frame construction. In 1815, city officials had banned new construction of wood-frame structures in the densest areas of the city. The 1845 fire demonstrated the efficacy of these restrictions, as the progress of the fire was checked when it spread toward areas rebuilt after the 1835 fire with such materials as stone, masonry, and iron roofs and shutters. In spite of general improvements, the 1845 fire prompted public calls for a more proactive <b>stance</b> <b>in</b> fire prevention and firefighting.|$|E

He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political <b>stance</b> <b>in</b> order to succeed at the national level. Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address and served {{as chair of the}} National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.|$|E

Abdullaev's offense was effective in the sixth and seventh rounds and as a result of this Cotto assumed a defensive stance. Following the eighth round Abdullaev's eye was swollen to the point of being almost entirely closed. In the ninth round following accurate punches by Cotto the fight's referee paused the fight and asked the ringside doctor to examine Abdullaev's eye. After being examined by the doctor Abdullaev indicated to the referee that he could not continue, this way Cotto retained the Welterweight division championship.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{states had}} already seceded when Breckinridge took his seat as a senator, leaving the {{remaining}} Southern senators more outnumbered in their defense of slavery. Seeking {{to find a}} compromise that would reunite the states under constitutional principles, he urged Lincoln to withdraw federal forces from the Confederate states in order to avert war. The congressional session ended on March 28, and in an April 2 address to the Kentucky General Assembly, he continued to advocate peaceful reconciliation of the states and proposed a conference of border states to seek a solution. On April 12, Confederate troops fired on Fort Sumter, ending plans for the conference. Breckinridge recommended that Governor Beriah Magoffin call a sovereignty convention to determine whether Kentucky would side with the Union or the Confederacy. On May 10, he was chosen by the legislature as one of six delegates to a conference to decide the state's next action. The states' rights delegates were Breckinridge, Magoffin, and Richard Hawes; the Unionist delegates were Crittenden, Archibald Dixon, and S.S. Nicholas. Unable to agree on substantial issues, the delegates recommended that Kentucky adopt a neutral <b>stance</b> <b>in</b> the Civil War and arm itself to prevent invasion by either federal or Confederate forces. Breckinridge did not support this recommendation, but he agreed to abide by it once it {{was approved by the}} legislature.|$|E
