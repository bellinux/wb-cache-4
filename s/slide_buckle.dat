40|$|Explication of the {{fracture}} processes of braided composites {{is needed for}} modeling their behavior. Described is a systematic exploration {{of the relationship between}} microstructure, loading mode, and micro-failure mechanisms in carbon/epoxy braided composites. The study involved compression and fracture toughness tests and optical and scanning electron fractography, including dynamic in-situ testing. Principal failure mechanisms of low <b>sliding,</b> <b>buckling,</b> and unstable crack growth are correlated to microstructural parameters and loading modes; these are used for defining those microstructural conditions which are strength limiting...|$|R
40|$|Two {{interfacial}} failure modes, shear <b>sliding</b> and <b>buckling,</b> of graphene on {{a flexible}} substrate subjected to uniaxial compression are investigated. The shear sliding {{starts at the}} edge region, and buckling starts at the middle region of graphene. Using shear-lag cohesive zone models and finite element (FE) simulations, the critical strain and maximum strain of graphene are predicted for the interfacial sliding failure. Then, the critical strain for the onset of buckling is derived via the theory of continuum mechanics with the van der Waals (vdW) interaction between graphene and the substrate surface taken into consideration. By comparison of the two critical failure strains and maximum strain of graphene, {{it is found that}} there exists a critical length of graphene. As the graphene length is larger than it, interfacial failure goes through four stages of development with increasing loading, including <b>sliding</b> and <b>buckling.</b> Conversely, the buckling of graphene will not occur. Finally, the influence of the interfacial adhesion energy and geometric size of graphene on the critical strains for interfacial <b>sliding</b> and <b>buckling</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: When a {{polymer film}} that is weakly {{attached}} to a rigid substrate is exposed to solvent, swelling-induced compres-sive stress nucleates buckle delamination of the film from the substrate. Surprisingly, the buckles {{do not have a}} sinusoidal profile, instead, the film near the delamination <b>buckles</b> <b>slides</b> toward the <b>buckles</b> causing growth of sharp folds of high aspect ratio. These folds do not result from a wrinkle-to-fold transition; instead, the film goes directly from a flat state to a folded state. The folds persist even after the solvent evaporates. We propose that patterned delamination and folding may be exploited to realize high-aspect ratio topological features on surfaces through control of a set of boundary constraints arising from the interrelation of film-surface adhesion, film thickness and degree of swellabilty...|$|R

This material, which we refer to as Z-carbon, is formed by pure sp 3 bonds {{and is the only}} carbon allotrope which provides an excellent match to unexplained features in experimental X-ray diffraction and Raman spectra of graphite under pressure. The transition from graphite to Z-carbon can occur through simple <b>sliding</b> and <b>buckling</b> of graphene sheets. Our calculations predict that Z-carbon is a transparent wide band gap semiconductor with a hardness comparable to diamond. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|Interfacial {{mechanics}} between graphene and substrate such as {{friction and}} adhesion plays {{a critical role}} in the morphology and functionality of graphene-based devices. Here I will present the interface <b>sliding</b> and <b>buckling</b> of monolayer graphene on a stretchable substrate. The nonlinear mechanical response of monolayer graphene on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is characterized using in-situ Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. Although interfacial stress transfer leads to tension in graphene as the PET substrate is stretched, retraction of the substrate during unloading imposes compression in the graphene. Two interfacial failure mechanisms, shear sliding under tension and buckling under compression, are identifi ed. Using a nonlinear shear-lag model, the inter-facial shear strength is found to range between 0. 46 and 0. 69 MPa. The critical strain for onset of interfacial sliding is ~ 0. 3 %, whereas the maximum strain that can be transferred to graphene ranges from 1. 2 % to 1. 6 % depending on the interfacial shear strength and graphene size. Beyond a critical compressive strain of ~- 0. 7 %, buckling ridg-es are observed after unloading. In addition, I will present adhesion measurement using atomic force microscope...|$|R

50|$|An expansive, major tornado {{outbreak}} sequence spawned 68 tornadoes, including 38 significant events, on April 19-21. Tornadoes {{affected the}} states of Arkansas, Tennessee, Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, North Dakota, and Oklahoma. On April 19, an F3 tornado struck Batesville in Arkansas, where structures were dislodged from their foundations or sustained collapse of their walls. 18 injuries occurred in town. Early on April 20, another F3 tornado struck the Ada area in Oklahoma, damaging about 500 structures and several aircraft. Numerous homes and a trailer park were razed, leaving 21 people injured. Later that morning, yet another F3 tornado hit near Harrison, Arkansas, where one fatality occurred and many homes disintegrated, with 19 injuries. An F2 tornado flattened barns and trailers near Sedalia, Missouri, dispersing debris for a few miles and injuring eight (possibly 13) people. Six injuries (possibly 12) occurred in an F3 tornado near Lockwood that leveled some homes and lofted debris for up to 35 mi. The strongest tornado of the day attained F4 intensity near La Plata, where one home disintegrated and was swept from its foundation, causing one death. Three injuries occurred as well. Two other F4 tornadoes struck Missouri on April 19 and 21, respectively. On the latter date, an F2 tornado in the Parnell-Holbrook area in Iowa struck 25 farms in its path, tearing off roofs, leveling several barns, and causing one home to <b>slide</b> and <b>buckle.</b> The tornado injured six (possibly only one) people. In all, the entire outbreak sequence killed two people and injured 106.|$|R
40|$|Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) {{investigations}} {{were performed}} to assess the depth and geometry of rock <b>slides</b> and <b>buckles</b> affecting a dip slope of regularly stratified limestones interbedded with marly-clayey horizons in the south-eastern Alps. This method was chosen because the absence of high cuts in the rock mass {{and the presence of}} debris and loosened slabs on the slope did not allow the geometry of the sliding mass to be described solely by means of field mapping. The application of GPR was encouraged by the favourable conditions of the geological "environment". More than 23 medium-frequency GPR lines were performed over compressive and tensile structures as well as over undeformed limestone sequences. Digitally collected data were filtered and processed to enhance deeper reflections, as well as corrected to account for topographic irregularities. GPR was instrumental in assessing the depth of the deformational and failure structures (e. g., buckle folds and tension cracks) induced by the instability phenomena as well as in evaluating deformation continuity along the sliding mass. The GPR surveys confirmed that the layers are continuous over extensive areas (even at the maximum penetration depth of about 6 m) and that deformations involve layer packages which are at least 5 metres thick. The first result indicates the importance of accounting for the mechanical separation of layers when conducting stability analyses while the second points out the inadequacy of common limit-equilibrium/elastic instability analyses. In fact, this type of procedure envisages the instability of much thinner layer packages, thus suggesting that a more complex elasto-plastic deformation analysis of thicker layer packages is more suited to this kind of phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Bifurcation of {{an elastic}} {{structure}} crucially {{depends on the}} curvature of the constraints against which {{the ends of the}} structure are prescribed to move, an effect that deserves more attention than it has received so far. In fact, we show theoretically and provide definitive experimental verification that an appropriate curvature of the constraint over which the end of a structure has to <b>slide</b> strongly affects <b>buckling</b> loads and can induce: (i) tensile buckling; (ii) decreasing- (softening), increasing- (hardening) or constant-load (null stiffness) postcritical behaviour; and (iii) multiple bifurcations, determining for instance two bifurcation loads (one tensile and one compressive) in a single-degreeof- freedom elastic system. We show how to design a constraint profile to obtain a desired postcritical behaviour and we provide the solution for the elastica constrained to slide along a circle on one end, representing the first example of an inflexional elastica developed from a buckling in tension. These results have important practical implications in the design of compliant mechanisms and may find applications in devices operating in quasi-static or dynamic conditions, even at the nanoscale...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} control pests, a {{specific}} management strategy called the threshold policy is proposed, {{which can be}} described by Filippov systems (or piecewise smooth systems). The aim of this work is to investigate a variety of bifurcation phenomena of the equilibria and sliding cycles of Filippov two stage structured population models with density dependent per capita birth rates and transition rates from the juvenile class into the adult class. It is shown that interadult competition alone can give rise to multiple sliding segments and multiple pseudoequilibria, whilst interadult and interjuvenile competition together can result in rich sliding bifurcations. As the threshold value varies, local sliding bifurcations including boundary node (saddle), tangency, and pseudo–saddlenode bifurcations occur sequentially, and global <b>sliding</b> bifurcations including <b>buckling</b> bifurcations of the sliding cycles, sliding crossing bifurcations, and pseudohomoclinic bifurcations can be present. Threshold policy control {{has been shown to}} be easily implemented and useful in pest management,which can be used to prevent the possibility of multiple pest outbreaks or cause the density of pests to stabilize at a desired level such as an economic threshold...|$|R
40|$|Information on {{the seismic}} {{response}} of chemical containers located in storage racks is very limited. Unfortunately, no clearly established data and statistics exist related to potential damage of chemical racking systems during earthquakes. Hence, this work presents an approach for developing fragility curves for chemical racking {{systems in the}} cross-aisle direction through dynamic non-linear analysis. It aims to simulate the structural behaviour of various racking systems in the cross-aisle direction for the worst-case scenario, in order to quantify the vulnerability of chemical racks in seismic areas and {{to better understand the}} associated natech risk. Analytical fragility curves and a fault tree model were derived and used to evaluate the probabilities of chemical containers falling from racks. The damage state limits were considered as four levels of intensity of loss of containment. Three damage modes (overturning, <b>sliding,</b> and <b>buckling),</b> two types of chemical containers (205 l metal drums and 1000 l IBCs), three types of rack base anchoring (unanchored, anchored-brittle, and anchored-plastic), and four rack heights (3, 4. 5, 6, 7. 5, 9 m) were considered in the analysis. Overall, twenty-four fragility curves were developed based on twenty-six strong motion records from the PEER Strong Motion database. However, the analytical method employed in this study can also be used for deriving fragility curves for other merchandise types of racking structures. In order to assess the natech risk of a chemical rack containing a flammable substance, to test the developed fragility curves, and to illustrate the natech risk assessment and mapping capabilities of RAPID-N, a case study based on the 1786 Olivieri earthquake scenario was conducted. The findings demonstrate that chemical racks loaded with IBCs are more vulnerable than those loaded with drums. Moreover, although a very robust anchorage reduces the probability of collapse of the rack, it increases the probability of chemical containers falling. JRC.

40|$|The {{underwater}} traps of the carnivorous {{plants of}} the Utricularia species catch their preys through {{the repetition of}} an "active slow deflation / passive fast suction" sequence. In this paper, we propose a mechanical model that describes both phases and strongly supports {{the hypothesis that the}} trap door acts as a flexible valve that buckles under the combined effects of pressure forces and the mechanical stimulation of trigger hairs, and not as a panel articulated on hinges. This model combines two different approaches, namely (i) the description of thin membranes as triangle meshes with strain and curvature energy, and (ii) the molecular dynamics approach, which consists in computing the time evolution of the position of each vertex of the mesh according to Langevin equations. The only free parameter in the expression of the elastic energy is the Young's modulus E of the membranes. The values for this parameter are unequivocally obtained by requiring that the trap model fires, like real traps, when the pressure difference between the outside and the inside of the trap reaches about 15 kPa. Among other results, our simulations show that, for a pressure difference slightly larger than the critical one, the door <b>buckles,</b> <b>slides</b> on the threshold and finally swings wide open, in excellent agreement with the sequence observed in high-speed videos.

40|$|Brush/fin thermal {{interfaces}} {{are being}} developed to increase heat-transfer efficiency and thereby enhance the thermal management of orbital replaceable units (ORUs) of electronic and other equipment aboard the International Space Station. Brush/fin thermal interfaces {{could also be used}} to increase heat-transfer efficiency in terrestrial electronic and power systems. In a typical application according to conventional practice, a replaceable heat-generating unit includes a mounting surface with black-anodized metal fins that mesh with the matching fins of a heat sink or radiator on which the unit is mounted. The fins do not contact each other, but transfer heat via radiation exchange. A brush/fin interface also includes intermeshing fins, the difference being that the gaps between the fins are filled with brushes made of carbon or other fibers. The fibers span the gap between intermeshed fins, allowing heat transfer by conduction through the fibers. The fibers are attached to the metal surfaces as velvet-like coats in the manner of the carbon fiber brush heat exchangers described in the preceding article. The fiber brushes provide both mechanical compliance and thermal contact, thereby ensuring low contact thermal resistance. A certain amount of force is required to intermesh the fins due to sliding friction of the brush s fiber tips against the fins. This force increases linearly with penetration distance, reaching ~ 1 psi (~ 6. 9 kPa) for full 2 -in. (5. 1 cm) penetration for the conventional radiant fin interface. Removal forces can be greater due to fiber buckling upon reversing the <b>sliding</b> direction. This <b>buckling</b> force can be greatly reduced by biasing the fibers at an angle perpendicularly to the sliding direction. Means of containing potentially harmful carbon fiber debris, which is electrically conductive, have been developed. Small prototype brush/fin thermal interfaces have been tested and found to exhibit temperature drops about onesixth of that of conventional meshing-fin thermal interface, when fabricated as a retrofit. In this case, conduction through the long, thin metal fins themselves becomes a thermal bottleneck. Further improvement could be made by prescribing aluminum fins to be shorter and thicker than those of the conventional meshing-fin thermal interfaces; the choice of height and thickness would be optimized to obtain greater overall thermal conductance, lower weight, and lower cost...|$|R
