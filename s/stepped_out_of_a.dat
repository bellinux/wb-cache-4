25|$|Late {{at night}} on 10 February 1942, Wavell {{prepared}} to board a flying boat, to fly from Singapore to Java. He <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> staff car, not noticing (because of his blind left eye) that it was parked {{at the edge of}} a pier. He broke two bones in his back when he fell, and this injury affected his temperament for some time.|$|E
2500|$|Corea's {{first major}} {{professional}} gig was with Cab Calloway. Corea started his professional {{career in the}} 1960s playing with trumpeter Blue Mitchell and Latin musicians such as Herbie Mann, Willie Bobo and Mongo Santamaría. One of the earliest recordings of his playing is with Mitchell's quintet on The Thing To Do. This album features his composition [...] "Chick's Tune", a retooling of [...] "You <b>Stepped</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Dream" [...] that demonstrates the angular melodies and Latin-and-swing rhythms that characterize, in part, Corea's personal style.|$|E
2500|$|Detective Chief Inspector Walter Dew, who was {{a detective}} constable in the Whitechapel CID {{throughout}} the Ripper investigation, and who knew Phillips well, remembered him as being in his fifties in 1888. [...] "He was a character," [...] Dew later wrote, [...] " [...] An elderly man, he was ultra old-fashioned both in his personal appearance and his dress. He used to look {{for all the world}} as though he had <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> century-old painting. His manners were charming: he was immensely popular both with the police and the public, and he was highly skilled" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1943 Šakić married Nada, Maks Luburić's {{half-sister}} {{who began}} working at Jasenovac at age 16. Šakić became {{the commander of}} the Jasenovac concentration camp at the age of twenty-two in April 1944, his rapid rise through the ranks of the Ustaše coming {{partly as a result of}} his fanatic support for Pavelić's regime and partly due to his marriage to Nada. Jasenovac survivor Šimo Klaić recalled: [...] "Šakić was very young for such an important position. He was arrogant and always impeccably dressed in polished black leather boots and a tailored black Ustaše uniform. We were emaciated, in rags and sick. He would stride past us looking as if he had <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fashion magazine".|$|E

6000|$|Snuffy strolled {{over to the}} boat. [...] "See that {{handsome}} girl, Si?" [...] {{he asked}} lazily. [...] "One of the Bentleys' boarders, I hear. Looks {{as if she might}} have <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> picture frame, don't she?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Amanda Shires' 2013 song [...] "Wasted and Rolling" [...] {{begins with}} [...] "The world zig-zagged and leaned/like <b>a</b> <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Gravitron still movin'".|$|R
60|$|He blew {{a shrill}} whistle, {{and a man}} <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> doorway. He was an {{enormous}} Sicilian, tall, sinewy and with a countenance as dark and fierce as his master's. In his belt was a long knife, such as {{is known as a}} stilleto.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did {{you ever}} see such a strong-looking place?" [...] asked Philippa. [...] "I don't want William's Island especially, but I'm sure I couldn't get it if I did. Look at that sentry on {{the summit of the}} fort, right beside the flag. Doesn't he look as if he had <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> romance?" ...|$|E
60|$|So {{they walked}} off again, quite as happily {{as if they}} had just <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> snug little house of their own, to look for lodgings on account of {{somebody}} else. Tom's simplicity was unabated, Heaven knows; but now that he had somebody to rely upon him, he was stimulated to rely a little more upon himself, and was, in his own opinion, quite a desperate fellow.|$|E

50|$|As {{the album}} was Manafest's first <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{independent}} status, the release only garnered a few glances from professional music sites and reviews. They were however, generally positive.|$|R
60|$|As I {{looked at}} him, {{with the sun}} shining upon his face, he {{certainly}} did seem a strange bird to be cooped up in such a cage. Tall and muscular, with a keen, dark face, and sharp, finely cut features, he might have <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> canvas of Murillo or Velasquez. There were latent energy and power in his firm-set mouth, his square eyebrows, and the whole pose of his elastic, well-knit figure.|$|E
60|$|To this Miss Cordelia {{took her}} way, {{surrounded}} by her small passengers, {{and they all}} trooped into the great farmhouse yard just as a big man <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nearby barn. As he approached, Miss Cordelia thought {{she had never seen}} anybody so much like an incarnate smile before. Smiles of all kinds seemed literally to riot over his ruddy face and {{in and out of his}} eyes and around the corners of his mouth.|$|E
60|$|They had now {{emerged from}} the gateway of the palace; and partly {{concealed}} {{by one of the}} pillars of the portico stood a figure such as may often be encountered in the streets and piazzas of Rome, and nowhere else. He looked as if he might just have <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> picture, and, in truth, was likely enough to find his way into a dozen pictures; being no other than one of those living models, dark, bushy bearded, wild of aspect and attire, whom artists convert into saints or assassins, according as their pictorial purposes demand.|$|E
60|$|And lastly, we {{have the}} dustman in love: the honest fellow having seen <b>a</b> young beauty <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gin-shop on a Sunday morning, is {{pressing}} eagerly his suit.|$|R
5000|$|The author {{begins his}} story by declaring that on one balmy September morning in 1954 a 25-year-old Venetian man <b>steps</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mansion {{just off the}} Grand Canal and into the street: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So does Mr. Lessingham himself," [...] Philippa {{reminded}} her. [...] "It isn't {{exactly a}} usual thing, is it, {{to have a}} perfectly charming and well-bred young man <b>step</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Zeppelin into your drawing-room." ...|$|R
60|$|The steer was roped {{to a tree}} {{when they}} came up with the pair, and Seaforth noticed with some inward {{amusement}} {{the way in which the}} two girls glanced at each other, and the contrast between them. Miss Deringham was almost too serene, and, he fancied, might have <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> picture. Miss Townshead's cheeks were crimson, her skirt was rent, and, though she had evidently found opportunity to effect some alteration, loose wisps of hair still hung about her shoulders. They were, however, of a fine silky brown, and it seemed to Seaforth, might have been arranged in a more unbecoming fashion.|$|E
60|$|They {{had passed}} through a hall and dining-room, and {{suddenly}} <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> window upon a gravelled terrace. From this a few stone steps descended to another terrace, on which trees and shrubs were growing; and yet, looking over the parapet, Mr. Clinch could see the road some twenty feet below. It was nearly on a level with, and part of, the second story of the house. Had an earthquake lifted the adjacent ground? or had the house burrowed into a hill? Mr. Clinch turned to his companion, who was standing close beside him, breathing quite audibly, and leaving an impression on his senses as of a gentle and fragrant heifer.|$|E
60|$|Captain Van Horn was a {{handsome}} man and a striking man, although Jerry did not know it. If ever a Holland Dutchman <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Rembrandt frame, Captain Van Horn was that one, {{despite the fact that}} he was New York born, as had been his knickerbocker ancestors before him clear back to the time when New York was not New York but New Amsterdam. To complete his costume, a floppy felt hat, distinctly Rembrandtish in effect, perched half on his head and mostly over one ear; a sixpenny, white cotton undershirt covered his torso; and from a belt about his middle dangled a tobacco pouch, a sheath-knife, filled clips of cartridges, and a huge automatic pistol in a leather holster.|$|E
50|$|Horton Court: Horton the Elephant <b>of</b> Horton Hears <b>A</b> Who <b>steps</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{open book}} {{accompanied}} by various ancillary characters from other Dr. Seuss stories, including Thing 1 and Thing 2 from The Cat in the Hat.|$|R
50|$|Robbo and his merry men {{are reduced}} to working as Santa Clauses to solicit {{charitable}} donations. They watch dumbfounded as Marian <b>steps</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car with her latest partner, Alan A. Dale, who casually gives the Santas money before going off with Marian.|$|R
50|$|Warehouse 13: An episode pays {{homage to}} the opening scenes of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in which the {{approach}} to a top secret facility in the desert finds the military being greeted by <b>a</b> man <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car in Joness attire.|$|R
60|$|To this impressiveness his {{appearance}} contributed largely. He was a fine, upstanding man, who looked less than his forty-nine years {{in spite of}} an ominous thinning of the hair which he tended and brushed so carefully. He had a firm chin, a mouth that smiled often and pleasantly beneath the closely-clipped moustache, and very bright blue eyes which met yours in a clear, frank, honest gaze. Though he had served in his youth in India, he had none of the Anglo-Indian's sun-scorched sallowness. His complexion was fresh and sanguine. He {{looked as if he}} had just <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cold tub--a misleading impression, for Uncle Chris detested cold water and always took his morning bath as hot as he could get it.|$|E
60|$|With {{her large}} brown eyes, thin, ascetic face, her pale skin, and broad forehead, {{she might have}} <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> picture by Burne-Jones. She had long, {{beautiful}} hands, with fingers deeply stained by nicotine. She wore sweeping draperies, mauve and green. There was about her the romantic air of High Street, Kensington. She was wantonly aesthetic; but she was an excellent creature, kind and good natured; and her affectations were but skin-deep. There {{was a knock at}} the door, and they all gave a shout of exultation. Miss Chalice rose and opened. She took the leg of mutton and held it high above her, as though it were the head of John the Baptist on a platter; and, the cigarette still in her mouth, advanced with solemn, hieratic steps.|$|E
6000|$|By {{the time}} the girls began to arrive, singly or in twos and threes, his mother {{was back in the}} little room, making tea for herself or sewing bits of them that had been torn as they <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cab, or helping them to put on the nightgowns, or pretending to listen pleasantly to their chatter and hating them all the time. There was every kind of them, {{gorgeous}} ones and shabby ones, old tired ones and dashing young ones, but whether they were the Honorable Mrs. Something or only Jane Anything, they all came to that room for the same purpose: to get a little gown and a pair of shoes. Then they went upstairs and danced to a stout little lady, called the Sylph, who bobbed about like a ball {{at the end of a}} piece of elastic. What Tommy never forgot was that while they danced the Sylph kept saying, [...] "One, two, three, four; one, two, three, four," [...] which they did not seem to mind, but when she said [...] "One, two, three, four, picture!" [...] they all stopped and stood motionless, though it might be with one foot as high as their head and their arms stretched out toward the floor, as if they had suddenly seen a halfpenny there.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> {{young woman}} <b>steps</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> elevator, bloody and half-naked. She leaves the {{building}} and runs down a busy street.

5000|$|The {{film critic}} for the New York Times agreed, noting that [...] "the figures often {{look as if they}} had <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> opera comique," [...] and, [...] "The make-up of the players is often more than a trifle overdone, {{especially}} when the villain reveals on close inspection his mouse-colored eyelids." ...|$|R
