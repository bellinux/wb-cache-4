Subjects: Twenty-four patients (4 men and 20 women) with moderate-to-severe COPD (FEV 1 41. 3 13 % predicted [mean SD]) aged 68. 1 8 years. Research Method: The SOBQ, providing only a total score, contains 24 items measuring perceptions of dyspnea for a variety of activities of daily living (ADLs). Three experts in pulmonary medicine and nursing classified each item into LE, upper extremity (UE), and WB activity subscores with the LE and WB subscores being the focus of this study. Using these proposed SOBQ subscores, a secondary analysis was performed using data obtained from an 8 week walking program. For the primary study, each subject completed both a SOBQ and 6 MW at baseline, 4, and 8 weeks. The relationship between 6 MW distance and proposed subscores at each time point was examined using <b>Spearman</b> <b>s</b> <b>rho</b> correlation.

If there is a clear understanding of how financial socialisation takes place and what informs financial behaviours, government and business can focus their efforts to ensure that South Africans have an increased financial capability. This will improve financial literacy and lead to increased financial security which is a necessity for overall wellness. A hypothetical model (Figure 2) was created from concepts that emerged during the literature review. An online questionnaire was completed by 300 participants in the financial services sector, examining factors which influenced the financial literacy and financial security of individuals. Principal Component Analysis was used to identify the components while Chi-square tests and <b>Spearman</b> <b>s</b> <b>Rho</b> was used to analyse the data for associations. Different factors influence financial literacy and financial security. This study did not find parents to be a significant influencer of financial socialising. Peers, friends and work colleagues were also not found to be a significant influencer of financial literacy and had a negative influence on financial security. Certain components of multimedia such as reading books were found to influence an individual s level of financial literacy and education, including formal financial education influenced the level of financial security. Demographic factors such as race and income also influence financial literacy and security.

40|$|AbstractRhodopsin {{phosphorylation}} {{was investigated}} using synthetic C-terminal peptides from rhodopsin. The peptides were phosphorylated by expressed rhodopsin kinase (RK) {{in the presence}} of a photolyzed truncated rhodopsin at the C-terminus. No peptide phosphorylation was detected under dark or in conditions in which RK was inactive. However, the phosphorylation rate was significantly higher in the following three peptides: (345 M Rho, 330 DDEASTTVSKTETSQMAPA; 347 <b>S</b> <b>Rho,</b> 330 DDEASTTVSKTETSQVASA; and 347 L Rho: 330 DDEASTTVSKTETSQVALA) taken from missense mutations of rhodopsin found in patients with autosomal retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP) as compared with that from wild-type rhodopsin (330 DDEASTTVSKTETSQVAPA). Distribution of the phosphorylation showed a similar ratio among three serines (334, 338 and 343) in 347 L Rho mutation to wild type. However, 345 M <b>Rho</b> and 347 <b>S</b> <b>Rho</b> peptides showed higher phosphorylation at Ser 334.

40|$|Objective: Several {{composite}} {{risk score}} indices, {{the most common}} being the Stroke Index and the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE), {{have been developed to}} predict perioperative events such as cerebrovascular accidents or death. The main aim {{of the present study was}} to compare the preoperative associations between the Stroke Index or the EuroSCORE with anxiety, depression, memory, attention, and executive functions scores in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods: Ninety-one patients were required to perform a preoperative psychological evaluation. Trail Making Test A and B (TMT A/B), Memory with 10 and 30 s interference, Digit Span Test, Phonemic Fluency, State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI Y 1 /Y 2), and Center for Epidemiological Study of Depression Scale (CES-D) were administered. The Stroke Index and the EuroSCORE were also considered for each patient. Correlations between the Stroke Index or the EuroSCORE, mood, and neuropsychological scores were performed. Results: Seventy-seven patients completed the psychological evaluation. The Stroke Index was significantly correlated with TMTA (rho = 0. 40, p = 0. 001), TMT B (rho = 0. 38, p = 0. 001), Memory with 10 <b>s</b> (<b>rho</b> = - 0. 34, p = 0. 003) and 30 <b>s</b> (<b>rho</b> = - 0. 40, p = 0. 001) interference, and Phonemic Fluency (rho = - 0. 29, p = 0. 01), but not with Digit Span Test (rho = - 0. 18, p = 0. 13), STAI Y 1 (rho = 0. 08, p = 0. 44), STAI Y 2 (rho = 0. 06, p = 0. 56), and CES-D (rho = 0. 11, p = 0. 31) scores. The EuroSCORE was significantly correlated not only with TMT A (rho = 0. 49, p = 0. 001), TMT B (rho = 0. 42, p = 0. 001), Memory with 10 <b>s</b> (<b>rho</b> = - 0. 23, p = 0. 04) and 30 <b>s</b> (<b>rho</b> = - 0. 35, p = 0. 002) interference, Phonemic Fluency (rho = - 0. 28, p = 0. 01), and Digit Span Test (rho = - 0. 28, p = 0. 01) but also with STAI Y 1 (rho = 0. 27, p = 0. 02), STAI Y 2 (rho = 0. 23, p = 0. 04), and CES-D (rho = 0. 26, p = 0. 02). Conclusions: While both the Stroke Index and the EuroSCORE account for the relationship between biomedical and cognitive risk factors in predicting perioperative risk, only the EuroSCORE also accounts for affective dysfunctions, which, in turn, have been proved to represent risk factors for perioperative adverse events. Therefore, compared with the Stroke Index, the EuroSCORE can be considered a more complete risk index in predicting perioperative risk. Data also suggest that a comprehensive preoperative evaluation of biomedical, mood, and cognitive performances might provide a more accurate mirror of the actual risk in patients undergoing cardiac surgery...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: To study the process of developing quality indicators using an expert panel and analyze the tension between feasibility and validity. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A multidisciplinary panel of 12 expert physicians was engaged in two rounds of modified Delphi process to refine and choose a smaller subset from 36 indicators; these were developed by a research team studying the quality of care in ambulatory post-myocardial infarction patients with co-morbidities. We studied the correlation between validity/feasibility ranks provided by the expert panel. The correlation between the quality indicators ranks on validity and feasibility scale and variance of experts 2 ̆ 7 responses was also individually studied. RESULTS: Ten of 36 indicators were ranked in both the highest validity and feasibility groups. The strength of association between validity and feasibility of indicators measured by Kendall tau-b was 0. 65.

In the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) we measured adiponectin and albuminuria {{before and after}} intervention, and we previously reported increases in adiponectin with interventions. Here we have used the DPP dataset {{to test the hypothesis}} that treatment-related increases in adiponectin may reduce albuminuria in obesity. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We evaluated cross-sectional correlations between plasma adiponectin and urinary albumin excretion at baseline, and the relationship of treatment-related changes in adiponectin and albuminuria. Baseline and follow-up urine albumin to creatinine ratios (ACR (albumin to creatinine ratio)) and plasma adiponectin concentration were available in 2553 subjects. RESULTS: Adjusting for age, sex and race/ethnicity, we observed a statistically significant but weak inverse relationship between adiponectin and ACR at baseline (conditional Spearman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rho</b> = (-) 0. 04, p = 0. 04). Although DPP treatments significantly increased plasma adiponectin, there were no treatment effects on ACR and no differences in ACR across treatment groups. There was a weak direct (not inverse) association between change in adiponectin and change in albuminuria (adjusted Spearman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rho</b> = (+) 0. 04, p = 0. 03). CONCLUSIONS: In a large, well-characterized cohort of obese dysglycemic subjects we observed a weak inverse association between circulating adiponectin concentrations and urinary albumin excretion at baseline. Contrary to the hypothesized effect, treatment-related increases in plasma adiponectin were not associated with a reduction in ACR. The association of change in adiponectin with change in ACR should be assessed in populations with overt albuminuria before excluding a beneficial effect of increasing adiponectin to reduce ACR in obesity...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} ascertain the concurrent validity of a brief six-point scale for the categorical scaling of PA levels. The effect of participant characteristics on the scales was also assessed. Methods: A comparative observational study was used. One hundred participants aged 18 - 80 years completed the valid and reliable International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and the Human Activity Profile (HAP) and a six-point scale. Quadratic weighted kappa, Spearman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rho,</b> and Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s exact tests were applied to compare the questionnaire results for concurrent validity. The effect of participant characteristics on PA level was analyzed using Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s exact test or analysis of variance. Results: Kappa values comparing the six-point scale with the IPAQ (κ = 0. 46) and HAP (κ = 0. 57) showed fair to good agreement. Analysis using Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s exact test illustrated a significant association between the six-point scale and both the HAP (p < 0. 000) and IPAQ (p < 0. 000). Spearman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rho</b> correlation values between the six-point scale and the IPAQ and the HAP were 0. 49 and 0. 69, respectively. Scores on all questionnaires were significantly related to age (p < 0. 05). Marital status and number of comorbidities were related to HAP and six-point scale scores (p < 0. 05). Occupation was significantly related to HAP but not the other two scales (p < 0. 000). Conclusion: The six-point scale provides a quick measurement of usual amount and intensity of PA that a person performs. This validation study found significant associations and a moderate strength of agreement when compared with the IPAQ and HAP. The six-point scale has the potential for utility in large-scale epidemiological studies as a quick method for scaling individuals by PA level...|$|R
40|$|Links {{between music}} and body motion {{can be studied}} through {{experiments}} called sound-tracing. One of the main challenges in such research is to develop robust analysis techniques {{that are able to}} deal with the multidimensional data that musical sound and body motion present. The article evaluates four different analysis methods applied to an experiment in which participants moved their hands following perceptual features of short sound objects. Motion capture data has been analyzed and correlated with a set of quantitative sound features using four different methods: (a) a pattern recognition classifier, (b) t-tests, (c) <b>Spearman</b> <b>s</b> Á correlation, and (d) canonical correlation. This article shows how the analysis methods complement each other, and that applying several analysis techniques to the same data set can broaden the knowledge gained from the experiment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{ultrasonic}} elastography features of phyllodes tumors of the breast comparing with fibroadenomas. A retrospective database was queried for the patients diagnosed as phyllodes tumors and fibroadenomas at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital from January 2008 to August 2012. Three hundred and fifty lesions from 323 consecutive patients were included in the study. All the cases were examined by conventional ultrasonography and ultrasound elastography. Ultrasound elastography was used to calculate strain ratio of the lesions with bilateral breast tissue at the same depth as reference. There were 36 phyllodes tumors (27 benign, 8 borderline, 1 malignant) and 314 fibroadenomas (158 the pericanalicular type, 103 the intracanalicular type, 53 other special types). The strain ratio for phyllodes tumors (3. 19 ± 2. 33) was significantly higher than for fibroadenomas (1. 69 ± 0. 88) (p< 0. 05). The <b>Spearman(.)</b> <b>s</b> correlation coefficient between strain ratio of ultrasound elastography and pathological groups was significant, with a value of 0. 17 (p< 0. 05). Ultrasound elastography could provide additional information to differentiate phyllodes tumors from fibroadenoma in breast...|$|R
40|$|Proteins in the Rho {{family are}} small monomeric GTPases {{primarily}} involved in polarization, control of cell division, and reorganization of cytoskeletal elements. Phylogenetic analysis of predicted fungal Rho proteins {{suggests that a}} new Rho-type GTPase family, whose founding member is Rho 4 from the archiascomycete Schizosaccharomyces pombe, is involved in septation. <b>S.</b> pombe <b>rho</b> 4 Δ mutants have multiple, abnormal septa. In contrast to <b>S.</b> pombe <b>rho</b> 4 Δ mutants, we show that strains containing rho- 4 loss-of-function mutations in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa lead {{to a loss of}} septation. Epitope-tagged RHO- 4 localized to septa and to the plasma membrane. In other fungi, the steps required for septation include formin, septin, and actin localization followed by cell wall synthesis and the completion of septation. rho- 4 mutants were unable to form actin rings, showing that RHO- 4 is required for actin ring formation. Characterization of strains containing activated alleles of rho- 4 showed that RHO- 4 -GTP is likely to initiate new septum formation in N. crassa...|$|R
