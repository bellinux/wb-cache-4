40|$|We have {{identified}} a 55 kDa protein, named GRASP 55 (Golgi reassembly stacking protein of 55 kDa), {{as a component of}} the Golgi <b>stacking</b> <b>machinery.</b> GRASP 55 is homologous to GRASP 65, an N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive membrane protein required for the stacking of Golgi cisternae in a cell-free system. GRASP 65 exists in a complex with the vesicle docking protein receptor GM 130 to which it binds directly, and the membrane tethering protein p 115, which also functions in the stacking of Golgi cisternae. GRASP 55 binding to GM 130, could not be detected using biochemical methods, although a weak interaction was detected with the yeast two-hybrid system. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that GRASP 65, like GM 130, is present on the cis-Golgi, while GRASP 55 is on the medial-Golgi. Recombinant GRASP 55 and antibodies to the protein block the stacking of Golgi cisternae, which is similar to the observations made for GRASP 65. These results demonstrate that GRASP 55 and GRASP 65 function in the stacking of Golgi cisternae...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{structurally}} characterize the homologous proteins GRASP 65 (Homo sapiens) and Grh 1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) by X-ray crystallography as well as to analyze the binding mechanism of GRASP 65 •GM 130 and Grh 1 •Bug 1 or Grh 1 •Uso 1. GRASP 65 localizes to the cis side of the Golgi apparatus and part of the Golgi cisternae <b>stacking</b> <b>machinery.</b> Due to its interaction with GM 130, GRASP 65 is involved in the docking of transport vesicles to the Golgi membrane. Like its human homologue, Grh 1 also localizes to the Golgi apparatus. Both proteins, GRASP 65 and Grh 1, can be divided into two different regions: an N-terminal GRASP domain and a C-terminal SPR domain. The GRASP domain can be further separated into two PDZ domains. Crystal structures of both single PDZ domains of GRASP 65 were determined. GRASP 65 PDZ 1 as well as GRASP 65 PDZ 2 reveal a β-sandwich fold typical for PDZ domains. We analyzed the interaction between GRASP 65 and GM 130 by ITC measurements to obtain binding constants. Earlier experiments demonstrated that GM 130 interacts with the second PDZ domain of GRASP 65. In our study the complete GRASP domain of GRASP 65 was necessary for interaction with GM 130. The binding constant of KD= 10. 0 ± 2. 9 µM is of the same magnitude as seen for other PDZ-peptide interactions. Co-crystallization of the GRASP domain of GRASP 65 and GM 130 was not possible. Therefore, we combined in silico the single PDZ domains of GRASP 65 to obtain a complete GRASP domain model where upon the GM 130 peptide was docked. Our model demonstrates typical binding between a class I peptide and a ligand-binding pocket. During this work the structure of Grh 1 PDZ 1 ΔβB was also determined. Superposition shows high structural similarity between GRASP 65 PDZ 1 and Grh 1 PDZ 1 ΔβB. So far, the function of Grh 1 is not known in detail. Golgi stacks are not observed in budding yeast – in contrast to mammalian cells – but the Golgi stacking protein Grh 1 is present in budding yeast. In analogy to GRASP 65, binding studies with peptides from potential interaction partners Bug 1 and Uso 1 would have provided insight into the function of Grh 1. However, we could not confirm binding with our designed constructs. Thus, the question about the biological function of Grh 1 remains open...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of PhilosophyA coal {{supply chain}} {{is a highly}} complex {{logistics}} system, comprising of several parties and components, focused on transporting coal from suppliers to end buyers. An important goal in many supply chains is to maximize the throughput. Due to the complex structure of a coal supply chain, a number of challenges arises when trying to maximize the throughput of the chain. One of the key challenges in a coal supply chain and one that plays a vital role when maximizing the throughput of the chain is the scheduling of preventive maintenance {{of the components of}} the chain that degrade over time, such as the rail network and the coal <b>stacking</b> <b>machinery.</b> During the maintenance period, the components are unavailable for work, which may result in a reduction in the throughput of the supply chain. In order to understand the complexities associated with the problem of scheduling preventative maintenance, we have analysed the complexity of an abstract version of the problem. We studied the problem of scheduling maintenance on arcs of a capacitated network so as to maximize the total flow from a source node to a sink node over a set of given time periods. Maintenance of an arc shuts down the arc {{for the duration of the}} period in which its maintenance is scheduled, reducing its capacity to zero for that period. A set of arcs is designated to have maintenance during the planning period, which will require each of the arcs to be shut down for exactly one time period. In general, this problem is known to be NP-hard. We have identified a number of characteristics that are relevant for the complexity of instance classes. In particular, we investigated instances with restrictions on the set of arcs for which maintenance is scheduled; series parallel networks; capacities that are balanced, in the sense that the total capacity of arcs entering a (non-terminal) node equals the total capacity of arcs leaving the node; and identical capacities on all arcs. Another factor that has a great impact on the throughput of the coal supply chain is the management of the stockyard, which is the interface between the land portion of the coal supply chain and the ocean portion of the coal supply chain, and where the cargoes get assembled. Given a number of vessels arriving at the port, stockyard management decisions include: assigning a location to each cargo (stockpile) of a vessel in the stockyard, scheduling the assembly of the cargoes, scheduling the stacking and reclaiming of the cargoes, etc. The resulting decision problem is challenging, but plays a crucial role in the overall performance of the logistics chain. In this thesis, we have focused on the placement of the stockpiles on the stock pads and the scheduling of the reclaiming of the stockpiles. We study a number of variants of an abstract scheduling problem inspired by the scheduling of the reclaimers in the stockyard of a coal export terminal. We have analysed the complexity of each of the variants, providing complexity proofs for some and polynomial algorithms for others. For some of the variants, we present mixed integer programming formulations, exact algorithms, such as branch and bound algorithms and dynamic programming algorithms, and constant factor approximation algorithms. Furthermore, we perform extensive computational studies to analyse the performance of the proposed solution methodologies...|$|E

40|$|The Hunter Valley coal {{supply chain}} (HVCC) {{is the system}} of {{logistics}} facilities - principally a network of rail track and three coal handling terminals - enabling coal mined by producers in the Hunter Valley to be transported, assembled, and loaded onto ships for export. The HVCC serves around 11 producers operating through more than 30 coal load points in the Hunter Valley, transporting coal over rail track extending around 450 km inland, managed by two track owner/operators, via rolling stock from four rail haulage providers that make around 22, 000 train trips for approximately 1, 400 vessels per year. The HVCC now delivers around 140 million tonnes of coal per annum (Mtpa), with the port of Newcastle exporting more coal by volume than any other facility in the world. The Hunter Valley Coal Chain Coordinator P/L (HVCCC) is the organization {{at the heart of}} this logistics operation. In a landmark for collaborative logistics, the HVCCC was established by HVCC stakeholders to plan and manage the valuable shared infrastructure of the system. The HVCCC provides a range of services vital to the planning and delivery of coal through the logistics system, with its core task to improve the capacity of the coal chain through a centralised planning process. One of the key ways in which this task is achieved is through the alignment of maintenance activities. All key assets in the HVCC (e. g. rail track sections, coal <b>stacking</b> <b>machinery,</b> terminal conveyor systems) undergo regular preventive maintenance, planned well in advance. While undergoing maintenance, an asset cannot function to deliver coal (or can function only with reduced capacity), thus reducing the capacity of the system. However astute scheduling of these planned maintenance activities releases latent capacity. Such astute scheduling is referred to as capacity or maintenance alignment, and is a core function of the HVCCC. The maintenance alignment process at the HVCCC is supported by a model of the system capacity, which quantifies the impact of maintenance activities on the system. This was originally achieved with the assistance of a manual model created in Microsoft Excel, which used as input the impact of each maintenance activity on key assets in the HVCC in terms of the reduction in tonnes per hour that the asset could handle. This was further developed by HVCCC in-house to the current production application known as the Annual Capacity Model (ACM), written in Microsoft C#. net stored in a Microsoft SQL database with business rules stored in Common Knowledge. This application, whilst fit for purpose, has limited scenario testing capability and no optimisation functionality. These issues were a catalyst for collaboration of the HVCCC with the University of Newcastle, leading to the development of two separate but symbiotic prototype optimisation applications: the Capacity Evaluator and the Maintenance Optimiser. The former builds on the model concepts and logic of the current HVCCC ACM to estimate system capacity for a given maintenance schedule. The latter reschedules maintenance activities so as to maximize system capacity. This paper focusses on the Capacity Evaluator (CE) application, and the recent enhancements to it that have facilitated its adoption. Based on a Linear Programming (LP) model, the CE constructs flows of coal over time so as to maximize total throughput, and offers new features, such as the ability to integrate in-bound and out-bound flows of coal at the terminal stockyards and account for greater complexity in the rail network. However the LP technology also presents new challenges: multiple optimal LP solutions mean that minor changes in input data can result in major variations in patterns of flow observed in the solutions. This paper reports on how this challenge was converted to an opportunity: flexibility in optimal solutions is exploited in a multiobjective approach to achieve flows consistent with contractual targets, while sacrificing little or nothing in terms of throughput. Both the mathematical modelling and decision support processes needed to achieve this, and to ensure the tool is fit for purpose, are described...|$|E

Further we prove an excess formula in this context. We introduce oriented stacks, generalizing oriented manifolds, which are stacks on which we can do string topology. We prove that the homology of the free loop stack of an oriented stack and the homology of hidden loops (sometimes called ghost loops) are a Frobenius algebra which are related by a natural morphism of Frobenius algebras. We also prove that the homology of free loop stack has a natural structure of a BV-algebra, which together with the Frobenius structure fits into an homological conformal field theories with closed positive boundaries. Using our general machinery, we construct an intersection pairing for (non necessarily compact) almost complex orbifolds which is in the same relation to the intersection pairing for manifolds as Chen-Ruan orbifold cup-product is to ordinary cup-product of manifolds. We show that the hidden loop product of almost complex is isomorphic to the orbifold intersection pairing twisted by a canonical class. Finally we gave some examples including the case of the classifying stacks [*/G] of a compact Lie group. Comment: extended version, 152 page...|$|R

Such special buildings generally contain <b>stacked</b> materials, heavy <b>machinery</b> and a heavy-duty crane. Seismic loads are critical for these structures, as the location of the building changes depending on seismic activities. In this research, the performance of a typical structural steel building {{to be used as a}} shopping mall and constructed using the section variation technique is studied for all five seismic zones of Uniform Building Code 97, namely 1, 2 A, 2 B, 3 and 4. This study investigated the effects of the variation of the seismic forces in various seismic zones for special and ordinary steel moment-resisting building frames with response modification factor values of R= 8. 5 and R= 4. 5, respectively. The parameters studied were the economy and the structural factors, design performance and detailing of the structures. The results indicate that structural steel can be saved by up to 7 % for main frames and 60 - 130 % for the lateral bracing by using special moment-resisting building frames (R= 8. 5) if proper detailing/construction of the steel moment-resisting frames is carried out according to the guidelines set forth by the AISC seismic provisions...|$|R
