50|$|A gascolator, {{also known}} as a main line strainer, <b>sediment</b> <b>bowl</b> or fuel strainer, acts {{primarily}} as a fuel drain for water and small particles of sediment and is usually found at the lowest point of an aircraft's fuel system. The gascolator is located below the level of the aircraft's carburetor and fuel tanks and on light aircraft is commonly located {{on the front of the}} firewall, as low as possible.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{there is}} also a gate with the city tram network next to the station which is used for service needs. From the very start, the station was built as a {{temporary}} stop, and it is very likely that when another extension to the south primarily the railway station Kryvyi Rih-Zakhidny and then into the southwestern Inguletsky Raion, but not before passing through the infamous Kryvorizhstal plant. Actually part of the track from Prospekt Metalurhiv, after leaving the tunnel passes on a 300-metre causeway over the <b>sediment</b> <b>bowl</b> of the latter plant. In total, this would raise the length of the system by 6.5 kilometres and make it the most important transport artery.|$|E
40|$|Tributyltin {{compound}} (TBT) {{released into}} the aquatic environment is generally degraded by bacteria in water and sediment. The isolation of TBT-degrading bacteria from TBT polluted sediment leads to the indication of specific potential TBT degraders. Two new strains of bacteria designated as B 2 and B 3 were successfully isolated using glycerol medium containing tributyltin chloride (TBTC) at 130 μM from contaminated <b>sediment</b> collected from <b>Bowling</b> Basin in Glasgow. The observed degradation after 14 days of the microcosm from the sediment and the isolated bacteria were investigated at an initial concentration of 1 μM TBTC. It was found that TBT was degraded by the bacterial strains B 2 and B 3 at 8. 3 and 16. 9 %, respectively. The results indicate that B 2 and B 3 are effective as TBT degraders. EC 50 of B 2 and B 3 in water were 88. 73 and 112. 53 μM TBTC, which {{were significantly higher than}} the concentration of TBT measured at the basin, suggesting a low effect of TBT on the growth and activity of bacteria. After identification using API 20 E and 16 S sequencing, the bacterial isolate strain B 2 is Citrobacter braakii and B 3 is Enterobacter cloacae. Therefore, this study has discovered two species of high resistance TBT degrader which have never been previously studied or isolated based upon TBT degradation ability...|$|R
40|$|A single {{large volume}} water sample {{taken at the}} mouth of the Upper Rhone River on Lake Geneva was {{processed}} directly in parallel through two continuous flow centrifuges, a Westphalia and an Alfa-Laval. Sediment was recovered from the Westphalia, and separately from the bowl and brass core of the Alfa-Laval. The three sediment samples were analyzed for particle size and the following elements: Zn, Cu, Mn, Cr, P, Co, B, V, Be, Sr, Na, Pb, Ni, Ba, Fe, Ca, and Mg. Results indicate that the particle size recovery of both machines is similar when sediment from the brass core and bowl of the Alfa-Laval are combined, and that the recovery for all elements other than Cu, V, B, and Pb are the same when the particle size differences are taken into account. Sediment from the Alfa-Laval brass core is clearly contaminated by Cu, B and is also elevated in V and Pb but not to a significant extent. The sediment recovered from the bowl of the Alfa-Laval is contaminated only with Cu, with a 10 ppm increase over the 52 ppm recovered in the Westphalia sediment. Operating procedures involve the discarding of the brass core sediment and the mixing of the Alfa-Laval <b>bowl</b> <b>sediment</b> with that from the Westphalia. The consequent increase in Cu is estimated at less than 5 ppm or within the confidence level of the analysis. These procedures are recommended to all operators of non modified Alfa-Laval units...|$|R
