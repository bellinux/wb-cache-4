500|$|The {{final year}} of {{production}} saw an overdate, 1883/2, with a visible [...] "2" [...] under or near the digit [...] "3". This variety {{was caused by the}} use of 1882-dated dies which were not destroyed {{at the end of the}} year, but were instead repunched with a four-digit logotype, [...] "1883". Five different dies are known to have been so reused, and Bowers estimates a mintage of 118,975pieces. <b>Spindel</b> estimates that only 0.2%–0.3% of the pieces have survived to the present.|$|E

The material data for the life prediction were determined on the specimens machined out of the critical areas of the components. For the component tests service-like stress-time histories with mean stress variation (spindle) and without (hub) as well as load time histories with a Gaussian frequency distribution (axle, spindle) were used. The comparison of the calculated fatigue life of the components, based on the material data, with the experimentally obtained life shows, that a reliable fatigue life prediction with the conventional local strain approach is not achieved. The accuracy of the fatigue life prediction should be improved by a systematic, phenomenologic description of the decisive effects...|$|R
