40|$|Microwave processing, as a {{new method}} for {{sintering}} ceramics, has key advantages such as increased heating rate, uniform heating and reduced cost compared to conventional methods. It is generally accepted that microwave sintering can improve the macroscopic mechanical performances of ceramics, however, the performances of microwave-sintered ceramics on the microscopic scale are rarely investigated. In the present study, the ceramics are sintered by hybrid microwave sintering (HMS), which combines the characteristics of microwave heating and conventional heating. To evaluate the homogeneous performance of the <b>sintered</b> <b>ceramics,</b> the behaviors of thermal residual stress distribution in the microwave-sintered and conventionally <b>sintered</b> <b>ceramics</b> were investigated by X-ray diffraction technique.

Thus, {{the objective of this}} study was to compare the biocompatibility properties of ZrO(2) -TiO(2) mixed ceramics. <b>Sintered</b> <b>ceramics</b> pellets, obtained from powders of TiO(2), ZrO(2), and three different ZrO(2) -TiO(2) mixed oxides were used. Roughnesses, X-ray diffraction, microstructure through SEM, hardness, and DRIFT characterizations were performed. For biocompatibility analysis cultured FMM 1 fibroblasts were plated on the top of disks and counted in SEM micrographs 1 and 2 days later. Data were compared by ANOVA complemented by Tukey`s test. All samples presented high densities and similar microstructure. The H(2) O content in the mixed ceramics was more evident than in pure ceramics. The number of fibroblasts attached to the disks increased significantly independently of the experimental group. The cell growth on the top of the ZrO(2) -TiO(2) samples was similar and significantly higher than those of TiO(2) and ZrO(2) samples.
