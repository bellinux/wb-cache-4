40|$|The {{spatially}} explicit {{reconstruction of}} historical forest {{plays an important}} role in understanding human modifications of land surfaces and its environmental effects. Based on an analysis of the forest change history of China, we devised a reconstruction method for the historical forest cover in China. The core idea of the method is that the lands with high <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>cultivation</b> will be cultivated and deforested first, spreading to marginal lands with lower <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>cultivation.</b> By determining the possible maximum distribution extent of the forest, as well as devising the land <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>cultivation</b> assessment model and provincial forest area allocation model, we created 10 km forest cover maps of China for the years 1700 to 2000 with 10 year intervals. By comparison with satellite-based data in 2000, we found that the grids within 25 % differences account for as much as 66. 07 % of all grids. The comparison with the historical documents-based data in northeast China indicated that the number of counties within 30 % relative differences is 99, accounting for 74. 44 % of all counties. Therefore, the forest area allocation model we devised can accurately reproduce the spatial patterns of historical forest cover in China. Our reconstruction indicates that from 1700 to the 1960 s, the deforestation mainly occurred in southwest China, the hilly regions of south China, the southeast of Gansu province, and northeast China; from the 1960 s to 2000, the reforestation occurred in most traditional forested regions of China, particularly in the Tibet Plateau, hilly regions of south China and the Greater Khingan Mountains. The spatially explicit forest cover data sets we reconstructed can be used in global or regional climatic models to study the impact of land cover change on climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

Cultivars used in the experiment were: Scorpio, Oscar, Tango and DRA 2086. Fruits were harvested in June, at optimal maturity. Sensory quality of roasted fruits was analyzed in the panel of 12 experts using the quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA). The set of 19 descriptors of quality plus overall quality were evaluated. Fruit colour was measured with HunterLab colorimeter, using CIE L*a*b* system. Fruit firmness was measured with HPE II durometer, and puncture load with a penetrometer. Results showed that growing mediums influenced some sensory traits, but genotype showed stronger influence on the quality of fruits. Physical traits of fruits were low related to growing mediums, but more to genotype. All the three growing mediums showed their <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> eggplant <b>cultivation</b> in respect of quality of the fruits. </span...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{pollution}} could directly reduce {{water quality}} <b>for</b> shrimp <b>cultivation.</b> This study aims {{to determine how}} the environmental quality, shrimp population and genetic characteristics of shrimp that live in polluted waters in shrimp ponds in East Java associated with WSSV disease that often attacks on cultivated shrimp. The method used was a descriptive exploratory. Data collection was collected by observation and interview with farmers on disease history. Water was sampled for water quality study and characterize its <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> shrimp <b>cultivations.</b> Shrimps were also sampled for morphological and genetical study for its susceptibility of WSSV. All samples were taken every week during shrimp cultivation in Malang ans Gresik. Morphological study using scoring method to determine the disease stages on shrimp, while for genetical study using specific primer for ICP 11 for WSSV detection, since ICP 11 is expressed when WSSV infection is occur. Samples were taken from 2 shrimp ponds in South Malang and Gresik. The overall water quality is good, except for NO 2 and TOM in both seawater shrimp ponds which higher than the freshwater/estuary shrimp ponds. Light infections of WSSV were detected in all seawater ponds both in morphology and genetics. However, in the freshwater/estuary pond only shrimps from freshwater/estuary Gresik which showing light WSSV infection genetically, but not in the morphological signs. Early disease detection is important to control the disease spread...|$|R
40|$|The {{benefits}} {{provided by}} underutilised fruit tree {{species such as}} baobab (Adansonia digitata L.) in combating increasing malnutrition and poverty become more apparent as awareness grows regarding concerns of climate change and food security. Due to its multiple uses, its high nutritional and medicinal value, drought tolerance and relatively easy cultivation, baobab {{has been identified as}} one of the most important edible forest trees to be conserved, domesticated and valued in Africa. In order to contribute towards the cultivation of the species, suitability of sites in Africa and worldwide was evaluated <b>for</b> potential <b>cultivation</b> using species’ locality data and spatial environmental data in MAXENT modelling framework. A total of 450 geo-referenced records of the baobab tree were assembled from herbarium records, commercial firm’s databases and fieldwork <b>for</b> modelling site <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> global <b>cultivation</b> of the baobab tree. Climatic and topographic data were acquired from the Worldclim data while soil data was obtained from the Harmonized World Soil Database. MAXENT was found to be a successful modelling method <b>for</b> studying <b>cultivation</b> potential. The main variables that contributed towards predicting baobab’s global cultivation potential were annual precipitation and temperature seasonality. Results suggest that baobab tree could be widely cultivated in most countries in southern Africa and in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa from Senegal to Sudan. Angola and Somalia were found to be highly suitable for cultivating baobab in Africa. Model suggests, India, where the baobab tree already exists and is used, to be the most suitable country <b>for</b> baobab <b>cultivation</b> outside Africa. North-west Australia, Madagascar, north-east Brazil and Mexico resulted to be other suitable places for cultivating the tree species. Although it is recommended model results be validated with in situ seedling experiments, there seems to be a great potential <b>for</b> the <b>cultivation</b> of this species globally. <br/...|$|R
