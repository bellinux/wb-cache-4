5|$|Prior to the war, Prinz Eugen was {{assigned}} to the 1st Battleship Division of Austro-Hungarian Navy. During World War I, the battleship saw limited service due to the Otranto Barrage which prohibited Austro-Hungarian battleships from leaving the Adriatic sea. As a result, <b>she</b> <b>hardly</b> ever left Pola.|$|E
5|$|In {{selecting}} Ved Vejen for the Danish Culture Canon, {{the selection}} committee {{operating under the}} Danish Ministry of Culture explained that the attraction {{of the novel is}} that it portrays with considerable empathy how a meek young woman becomes increasingly aware of desires <b>she</b> <b>hardly</b> knew she possessed. With bittersweet irony, the author allows Katinka to develop her infatuation by listening to the heartaches of others. With its almost cinematic sequences, the novel conveys a balance between its subdued humour and a strong sympathy for what goes on in people's minds, especially in a secluded environment removed from mainstream society. It is not just Bang's portrayal of a bygone provincial world that seems so typically Danish but his mastery in making the hidden pain of loneliness so meaningful to today's readership. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow, starring Tammi Øst as Katinka.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of success at youth interstate level, Ebsary was {{promoted}} into the senior South Australian team in the 2000–01 season {{at the age of}} 17, playing in all of her state's eight matches in the Women's National Cricket League (WNCL). She made her debut against reigning champions New South Wales, and after not batting, took one wicket for the loss of six runs (1/6) from two overs as South Australia lost by seven wickets. In the next match of the double-header the next day, she took 0/15 from two overs and was run out for a duck in her maiden senior innings in a 22-run loss. During the season, Ebsary often batted {{at the bottom of the}} order in a specialist bowler's position and thus rarely batted, but <b>she</b> <b>hardly</b> bowled, delivering only six overs in total in her first seven matches. In effect, she was shielded from taking on a meaningful workload and not trusted to contribute with either bat or ball. In the last match of the season, she was finally given a substantial opportunity against Queensland, taking 3/21 from seven overs, as South Australia proceeded to a six-wicket victory. Nevertheless, in eight matches she scored only six runs at 2.00 in three innings, and took five wickets at a bowling average of 9.40 and an economy rate of 3.61. South Australia won only three matches and did not make the finals.|$|E

60|$|COLLINS. Lord bless you, maam, I'm that fond {{of my old}} Matilda that I {{never tell}} her {{anything}} at all for fear of hurting her feelings.

25|$|In 1924, {{her family}} moved from Florence {{to settle in}} the nearby town of Viareggio, on the coast of Tuscany. After {{settling}} in Viareggio, <b>she</b> <b>hardly</b> ever left that town. In Viareggio she led a life dominated by solitude and, except for occasional excursions to the seaside and the pine-forest, her days mostly consisted of doing the daily household shopping and visiting the Blessed Sacrament in church.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} decades of her life, the {{telephone}} became her only means of communication with the outside world, even with her children and close friends. She often talked up to six or seven hours {{a day on the}} phone, but <b>she</b> <b>hardly</b> spent any time with anyone in person in her final years. A documentary, Calling Hedy Lamarr, was released in 2004 and featured her children, Anthony Loder and Denise Loder-DeLuca.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the first}} {{examination}} for her tragedy class, {{she tried to}} straighten her abundance of frizzy hair, which made it even more uncontrollable, and came down with a bad cold, which made her voice so nasal that <b>she</b> <b>hardly</b> recognized it. Furthermore, the parts assigned for her perform were classical and required carefully stylized emotions, while she preferred romanticism and fully and naturally expressing her emotions. The teachers ranked her 14th in tragedy and second in comedy. Once again, Morny came to her rescue. He put in a good word for her with the National Minister of the Arts, Camille Doucet. Doucet recommended her to Edouard Thierry, the chief administrator of the Théâtre Français, who offered Bernhardt a place as a pensionnaire at the theater, at a minimum salary.|$|E

500|$|Also in 1953, Leigh {{recovered}} {{sufficiently to}} play The Sleeping Prince with Olivier, and in 1955 they performed a season at Stratford-upon-Avon in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, Macbeth, and Titus Andronicus. They played to capacity houses and attracted generally good reviews, Leigh's health seemingly stable. John Gielgud directed Twelfth Night and wrote, [...] "...perhaps I will {{still make a}} good thing of that divine play, especially if he will let me pull her little ladyship (who is brainier than he but not a born actress) out of her timidity and safeness. He dares too confidently... but <b>she</b> <b>hardly</b> dares at all and is terrified of overreaching her technique and doing anything that she has not killed the spontaneity of by overpractice." [...] In 1955 Leigh starred in Anatole Litvak's film The Deep Blue Sea; co-star Kenneth More felt he had poor chemistry with Leigh during the filming.|$|E
500|$|Overall, {{the show}} {{received}} {{a positive response}} from many music critics. Mike Weatherford of the Las Vegas Review-Journal wrote, [...] "The spectacle rivals Celine Dion's 'A New Day' as the singer transforms from fragile soul to the rock warrior alter ego of her album title, I Am ... Sasha Fierce." [...] Melissa Arseniuk of Las Vegas Weekly wrote in her review of the show, [...] "Once Beyoncé took to the stage, <b>she</b> <b>hardly</b> left it. Appearing both on her own and with back-up dancers, she worked the theater {{from left to right}} throughout the showcase. She sang, danced, and looked good while she did it... Indeed, the mezzo-soprano is as easy on the eyes as she is on the ears." [...] John Griffiths of Us Weekly described the concert as [...] "lavish". Andy Kellman from Allmusic wrote, [...] "The show is certainly a theatrical production worthy of Vegas, with Beyoncé and her large backing band energetically rolling through the singer's back catalog." ...|$|E

500|$|The video {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics who praised Cole's sense of fashion but cited that the video was unoriginal. Elena Gorgan of Softpedia said [...] "even with all this, <b>she</b> <b>hardly</b> manages {{to create a}} strong impression [...]., the video fails to break any visual ground, albeit standing on its own as a stylish video." [...] The Daily Mail agreed saying [...] " [...] which {{will no doubt be}} interpreted by fans as an insight into Cheryl's marriage to footballer Ashley Cole. Cheryl has ditched her street dance gear for a gown fit for a diva along with suitably styled big hair ... But as she teams up with Black Eyed Peas rapper will.i.am is sporting a more feminine look. The net result is, sorry to say it, very regal but a bit on the dull side." [...] Lisa McGarry of 'Unreality TV' [...] said the platinum wig was [...] "strange" [...] She also said [...] "if it doesn’t look great, at least it looks shocking." [...] Meanwhile, David Balls of 'Digital Spy' said [...] " [...] this glitzy split-screen affair, Cheryl looks effortlessly classy and glam as she transforms into an Egyptian goddess and - with more success than a certain Mrs. B (Mel B) back in 2001 [...] - shows how to wear a blonde wig without looking like you're on a dirty weekend in the Toon. Perfectly complimenting the song itself, this super-glossy clip also suggests that Cole has a firm eye on global stardom over the next year." [...] Fame magazine called the video [...] "a little edgier than anything Girls Aloud have done".|$|E
2500|$|In 1952 in {{a letter}} to her American friend Dorothy Norman, Gandhi wrote: [...] "I am in no sense a feminist, but I believe in women being able to do everything...Given the {{opportunity}} to develop, capable Indian women have come to the top at once." [...] While this statement appears paradoxical, it reflects Gandhi's complex feelings toward her gender and feminism. Her egalitarian upbringing with her cousins helped contribute to her sense of natural equality. [...] "Flying kites, climbing trees, playing marbles with her boy cousins, Indira said <b>she</b> <b>hardly</b> knew the difference between {{a boy and a girl}} until the age of twelve.", ...|$|E
2500|$|Without the tireless work of Maclean's daughter, Nan Milton, {{the memory}} of her father might have been lost. It was not just that she helped found the John MacLean Society and served as it's Secretary, she made the revival possible. At a time when no one was interested, she copied out all her father's {{writings}} from his own and other publications in the National Library and typed them up. That was how Hugh MacDiarmid read his works and then championed his ideas [...] Her first husband wrote a biography of MacLean and lent the only copy of the manuscript to the West Indian Socialist CLR James, who left it on a London Tube train. Nan painstakingly reconstructed it for her own biography. Her devotion was remarkable because <b>she</b> <b>hardly</b> knew her father. He became separated from his wife and family when she was an infant because he had time for nothing except work.|$|E
