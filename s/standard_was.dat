40|$|Lidar <b>standards</b> <b>are</b> {{needed to}} ensure quality and lidar product control at the {{interface}} between lidar manufacturers and lidar users. Meanwhile three lidar <b>standards</b> have <b>been</b> published by German and international standardization organizations. This paper describes the cooperation between the lidar technique inventors, lidar instrument constructors, and lidar product users to establish useful standards. Presently a backscatter lidar <b>standard</b> <b>is</b> elaborated in Germany. Key points of this <b>standard</b> <b>are</b> presented here. Two German <b>standards</b> <b>were</b> already accepted as international standards by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Hence, German and international organizations {{for the establishment of}} lidar <b>standards</b> <b>are</b> introduced to encourage a cooperative work on lidar standards by lidar scientists...|$|R

5|$|As it {{had been}} two decades since much silver was {{regularly}} deposited for striking into coins, {{the fact that the}} United States had been on a bimetallic standard since 1792 was often forgotten. The gold <b>standard</b> <b>was</b> seen as the only possible choice, and many people assumed that the United States was on that standard, which had been adopted by strong nations like the United Kingdom (1816) and the German Empire (1871).|$|E
5|$|Detectives began re-examining 10,000 witness statements, and {{submitting}} {{items for}} forensic tests {{not available in}} 1985. In September 2004 the back garden of a terraced council house in Willan Road, near the Broadwater Farm estate, was excavated after a tip-off. A female friend of Cynthia Jarrett, the woman whose death sparked the Broadwater Farm riot, lived alone at the house between 1984 and 1989, {{and according to the}} Evening <b>Standard</b> <b>was</b> one of the first on the scene when police raided Jarrett's house.|$|E

40|$|INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION We examine anticipatory product {{standards}} {{intended to}} improve the strategic position of firms in an international patent race where firms do R&D to develop products that are close substitutes. The effects of a <b>standard</b> <b>are</b> shown {{to depend on the}} way the <b>standard</b> <b>is</b> specified, which firm develops which product, and on the order in which products <b>are</b> discovered. Simple <b>standards</b> <b>are,</b> in general, time inconsistent because of consumer losses that occur when products ruled out by the <b>standard</b> <b>are</b> discovered before the product set as the standard. A state contingent <b>standard</b> <b>is</b> shown to be time consistent when compulsory licensing by the foreign firm is introduced...|$|R

5|$|Since {{trade and}} {{commerce}} typically involve items significantly more massive than one gram, and since a mass standard made of water would be inconvenient and unstable, {{the regulation of}} commerce necessitated the manufacture of a practical realization of the water-based definition of mass. Accordingly, a provisional mass <b>standard</b> <b>was</b> made as a single-piece, metallic artifact one thousand times as massive as the gramâ€”the kilogram.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{standard}} {{is a set}} of guidelines which are used to ensure that the animals produced by a breeder or breeding facility conform to the specifics of the standardized breed. All registered Highland cattle must conform to it. The breed <b>standard</b> <b>was</b> created in Inverness on 10 June 1885. There are four main parts to the standard: the head, the neck, the back and body, and the hair. Below is a concise list of the main points of the {{breed standard}}. A judge in a show will judge the cattle against a provided breed standard.|$|E
5|$|The free silver {{movement}} {{reached its}} height with the 1896 campaign of former Nebraska representative William Jennings Bryan, {{who won the}} Democratic nomination for president after his Cross of Gold speech, which decried the gold standard, electrified the 1896 Democratic National Convention. Bryan was defeated in the election by former Ohio governor William McKinley, and in 1900, Congress passed the Gold Standard Act, placing that standard into law. The gold <b>standard</b> <b>was</b> departed from for many purposes by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal administration, and completely ended by President Richard Nixon in 1971.|$|E

5|$|Upon his accession, Domitian revalued the Roman coinage to the {{standard}} of Augustus, increasing the silver content of the denarius by 12%. An imminent crisis in 85 however forced a devaluation to the Neronian standard of 65, but this was still higher than the level which Vespasian and Titus had maintained during their reign, and Domitian's rigorous taxation policy ensured that this <b>standard</b> <b>was</b> sustained for the following eleven years. Coin types from this era display a highly consistent degree of quality, including meticulous attention to Domitian's titulature, and exceptionally refined artwork on the reverse portraits.|$|E
5|$|After {{the close}} of the session, Sherman {{returned}} to Ohio to campaign for the Republican nominee for governor there, former governor Rutherford B. Hayes. The issue of specie payments was debated in the campaign, with Hayes endorsing Sherman's position and his Democratic opponent, incumbent Governor William Allen, in favor of increased circulation of greenbacks redeemable in bonds. Hayes won a narrow victory and was soon mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 1876. The controversy over resumption carried into the presidential election. The Democratic platform that year demanded repeal of the Resumption Act, while the Republicans nominated Hayes, whose position in favor of a gold <b>standard</b> <b>was</b> well known. The election of 1876 was very close, and the electoral votes of several states were ardently disputed until mere days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Louisiana was one of the states in which both parties claimed victory, and Grant asked Sherman and a few other men to go to New Orleans and ensure the party's interests were represented.|$|E

5|$|Following the sinking, a Board of Inquiry was {{established}} to investigate the loss. Based on its findings, Captain Loben Maund was court-martialled in February 1942 for negligence. He was found guilty on two counts of negligence: one of failing to ensure that properly constituted damage control parties had remained on board after the general evacuation, and one of failing to ensure the ship was in a sufficient state of readiness to deal with possible damage. The board tempered their judgement with an acknowledgement that a high <b>standard</b> <b>was</b> being expected of Maund, {{and that he was}} primarily concerned with the welfare of his crew.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, the Sherman Silver Purchase Act greatly {{increased}} government purchases of silver. The government pledged {{to stand behind}} the silver dollars and treasury notes issued under the act by redeeming them in gold. Pursuant to this promise, government gold reserves dwindled over the following three years. Although the economic Panic of 1893 {{had a number of}} causes, President Grover Cleveland believed the inflation caused by Sherman's act to be a major factor, and called a special session of Congress to repeal it. Congress did so, but the debates showed bitter divides in both major parties between silver and gold factions. Cleveland tried to replenish the Treasury through issuance of bonds which could only be purchased with gold, with little effect but to increase the public debt, as the gold continued to be withdrawn in redemption for paper and silver currency. Many in the public saw the bonds as benefiting bankers, not the nation. The bankers' feeling was that they did not want loans repaid in an inflated currencyâ€”the gold <b>standard</b> <b>was</b> deflationary, and as creditors, they preferred to be paid in such a currency, whereas debtors preferred to repay in inflated currency.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{she became}} the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the PanthÃ©on, Paris. The curie (symbol Ci), a unit of radioactivity, is named in honour of her and Pierre (although the {{commission}} which agreed on the name never clearly stated whether the <b>standard</b> <b>was</b> named after Pierre, Marie or both of them). The element with atomic number 96 was named curium. Three radioactive minerals are also named after the Curies: curite, sklodowskite, and cuprosklodowskite. She received numerous honorary degrees from universities across the world. The Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie Actions fellowship program of the European Union for young scientists wishing to work in a foreign country is named after her. In Poland, she had received honorary doctorates from the LwÃ³w Polytechnic (1912),PoznaÅ„ University (1922), KrakÃ³w's Jagiellonian University (1924), and the Warsaw Polytechnic (1926). In 1921, in the U.S., she was awarded membership in the Iota Sigma Pi women scientists' society.|$|E
40|$|Performance <b>standards</b> <b>are</b> arguably one of {{the most}} {{controversial}} topics in educational measurement. There are uses of assessments such as licensure and certification where performance <b>standards</b> <b>are</b> essential.

Distinctions between essential and nonessential uses of performance <b>standards</b> <b>are</b> discussed. It is argued that the insistence on reporting in terms of performance standards in situations where they are not essential has been more harmful than helpful. Variability in the definitions of proficient academic achievement by states for purposes of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 is discussed and it is argued that the variability is so great that characterizing achievement is meaningless.
