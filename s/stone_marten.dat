2500|$|In the Iberian peninsula, the Eurasian eagle-owl {{is part of}} {{a complex}} guild of predators that have evolved to survive mostly on European rabbits. Among this guild, golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) were {{recorded}} per one study to rely on rabbits for 40% of the diet, the eagle-owl for 49% of the diet, the Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti) for 50% of the diet, the Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata) [...] for 61% of the diet and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) for 79% of the diet. Elsewhere, the Spanish imperial eagle and eagle-owl are considered to outflank the golden and even the Bonelli’s eagle as the most specialized avian predator of rabbits in the Iberian region. Other predators, such as common buzzard (Buteo buteo), [...] northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) black kite (Milvus migrans) Iberian wildcat (Felis silvestris tartessia), red fox, <b>stone</b> <b>marten</b> (Martes foina) and introduced Egyptian mongoose also prey heavily on rabbits in Spain, but are more generalized and less reliant than the above predators. All these powerful predators do not generally compete directly for food but conflicts may ensue over the rights to territories and nesting sites amongst the birds. Being nocturnal in activity, however, the Eurasian eagle-owl does not tend to compete as directly as do the three eagle species and even these are discreetly segregated by habitat preferences, the goldens preferring open, steep cliffs, the Bonelli's favoring densely vegetated areas mixed with rocky spots and the imperial favoring relatively flat open woodlands. Among these eagles, the golden eagle tends to have the most similar habitat preferences to the Eurasian eagle-owl and across a broad band of overlapping distribution, the two are considered nearly ecological equivalents by day and night. However, good-sized female golden eagles are up to twice as heavy as an average eagle-owl, so seem to have a considerable advantage in size and power. Conversely, to support their large size and large territory needs, the golden eagle cannot survive on small and diverse prey nearly as successfully as the eagle-owl. Among the Iberian peninsula rabbit-eating guild, the species with wider ranges, the eagle-owl and the golden and Bonelli's eagles, have had some degree of success living off of alternate prey following the devastation of the rabbit population due to rabbit haemorrhagic disease. The two rabbit predators endemic to Iberia, the Iberian lynx and Spanish imperial eagle, have been devastated by the reduction and other causes and both are threatened species today.|$|E

40|$|Martes martes and Martes foina occur sympatrically {{in most of}} Europe. Little {{is known}} about {{differences}} between trophic niches of these species, because martens are difficult to observe and {{it is impossible to}} distinguish between scats of both species based on their morphological features. To resolve this problem, we used DNA extracted from faeces for species identification. This method allowed us to compare the diet of the two species in the area of their sympatric occurrence in central Poland. We analysed the composition of 287 scats of <b>stone</b> <b>martens</b> and 155 of pine martens. Both species fed mainly on small rodents, birds and fruits. Although the trophic niches of both martens highly overlapped, we found significant quantitative differences in their food composition.

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al 11 th International Mammalogical Congress, celebrado en Belfast (Irlanda) del 11 al 16 de agosto de 2013. Camera {{trapping}} methods {{provide valuable}} tools for monitoring carnivore communities, but detection rates are usually low due to these species low density. We assessed the detectability of Mediterranean carnivores by camera traps for several attractants in two study areas in Central Spain, analyzing the data with occupancy models.

The combination LU+VE produced higher detection probability for red foxes, Egyptian mongooses and Eurasian wildcats than a bait lure (raw chicken). However, raw chicken yielded a higher detectability for <b>stone</b> <b>martens,</b> common genets and Eurasian badgers.

40|$|Sixteen <b>stone</b> <b>martens</b> (Martes foina) were intensively radio-tracked {{in central}} Italy {{in order to}} assess their spacing patterns. Home-range sizes and {{distances}} travelled per night were analysed with respect to sex, age, season, and habitat. Intrasexual territoriality is confirmed for the species; home-range edges appeared to be determined by the dispersion of neighbours' territories. Home-range size was positively correlated with the presence of woodland (less abundant and more dispersed resources). Males travelled longer distances than females, although home-range sizes did not differ significantly by sex; males did not move more during the rutting season than in other seasons. Subadults were tolerated by adults for varying periods, then in some cases they started an exploring phase before settling into a vacant territory. Stone martens' spacing patterns were affected by sex, age, social interactions, and resources. In particular, social patterns appear to be a key influencing factor, as territoriality, parental behaviour, mating interactions. and dispersal of young can account for site fidelity, dispersion of home ranges, and distance travelled. In particular, our data indicate the importance of the extended relationship between the mating pair, which is probably related to male parental investment, in determining the spacing patterns of the species...|$|R

During the period 2009 - 2013, the prevalence in golden jackals (Canis aureus) was 7. 32 %, in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) 1. 55 %, in wolves (Canis lupus) 1. 43 %, and in wild cats (Felis silvestris) 7. 69 %. No adult heartworm specimens were found in beech <b>martens</b> (Martes foina), <b>stone</b> <b>martens</b> (Martes martes), European polecats (Mustela putorius), badgers (Meles meles) or otter (Lutra lutra).

40|$|During {{the past}} decades the {{percentage}} of badgers falling victim to traffic accidents in the Netherlands had rapidly climbed to over 12 % annually by the early 1990 's (Tab. 1). Along with other endangering factors this loss {{was seen as a}} threat to the survival of the badger population. An important measure to reduce the number of traffic victims was the construction of badger passages (Figs. 1 - 3) together with the fencing of roads along these passages (Fig. 4). Free land observations showed that these pipes with a diameter of 30 - 40 cm were still attractive to badgers even if their lengths exceeded 100 m. Controls showed that the effectiveness of these passages was highly dependent upon the quality and the length of the adjacent fencing. The proper construction and careful maintenance of the passages and especially the fences are prerequisites for their efficacy. Despite the construction of more than two hundred passages the numbers of badgers killed in traffic accidents increased annually by more than 12 % during the first half of this decade. On the other hand the badger population has also increased although a quantitative determination of this increase is still lacking. Hence, an evaluation of whether the construction of badger passages and adjacent fencing led to a decrease in {{the percentage of}} badgers killed by vehicles is not possible.

40|$|Efforts {{to reduce}} the {{negative}} impacts of roads on wildlife may be hindered if individuals within the population vary widely in their responses to roads and mitigation strategies ignore this variability. This knowledge is particularly important for medium-sized carnivores as they are vulnerable to road mortality, while also known to use available road passages (e. g., drainage culverts) for safely crossing highways. Our goal {{in this study was}} to assess whether this apparently contradictory pattern of high road-kill numbers associated with a regular use of road passages is attributable to the variation in behavioral responses toward the highway between individuals. We investigated the responses of seven radio-tracked <b>stone</b> <b>martens</b> (Martes foina) to a highway by measuring their utilization distribution, response turning angles and highway crossing patterns. We compared the observed responses to simulated movement parameterized by the observed space use and movement characteristics of each individual, but naı¨ve to the presence of the highway. Our results suggested that martens demonstrate a diversity of responses to the highway, including attraction, indifference, or avoidance. Martens also varied in their highway crossing patterns, with some crossing repeatedly at the same location (often coincident with highway passages). We suspect that the response variability derives from the individual’s familiarity of the landscape, including their awareness of highway passage locations. Because of these variable yet potentially attributable responses, we support the use of exclusionary fencing to guide transient (e. g., dispersers) individuals to existing passages {{to reduce the}} road-kill risk...|$|R
