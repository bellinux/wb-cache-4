40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{investigate}} the postoperative subjective and objective outcomes of different surgical treatments for superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) : vestibular signs, auditory signs, vestibular evoked myogenic potential test, pure tone audiogram, <b>speech</b> <b>audiogram,</b> or video-nystagmography. DATA SOURCES: An electronic search {{performed in the}} PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases on 15 th of September 2015. A systematic search was conducted. Articles were included if written in English, Dutch, German, or French language. STUDY SELECTION: Original studies reporting on the pre and postoperative subjective and/or objective outcomes of surgical treatments for superior semicircular canal dehiscence were included. DATA EXTRACTION: The methodological quality of the studies was independently assessed by two reviewers using a constructed critical appraisal, to assess the directness of evidence {{and the risk of}} bias. The results of the pre and postoperative subjective and/or objective outcomes were extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS: Comparative study was conducted. CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment for SSCD is particularly effective for vestibular symptoms and there is no evidence for improvement of hearing loss after surgical treatment. Since plugging using transmastoid approach had a lower complication rate, lower revision rate, and a shorter hospital stay, this treatment is recommended in high disabled SSCD patients...|$|E
40|$|Background and ObjectivesZZThe aim of {{this study}} is to assess the {{correlation}} between the threshold of click-evoked auditory brainstem response (ABR) and the pure-tone averages in various formulas. Subjects and MethodZZData were obtained from 207 patients (326 ears) with sudden senso-rineural hearing loss. All subjects underwent hearing threshold evaluation using pure tone au-diogram (PTA), <b>speech</b> <b>audiogram</b> and click-evoked ABR. Linear regression analyses were applied to assess the relation between threshold of click-evoked ABR and threshold of separate frequencies of the PTA and to analyze the correlation between threshold for click-evoked ABR and various pure-tone averages. ResultsZZResults revealed a significant relation between the threshold of click-evoked ABR and PTA thresholds at 0. 5 kHz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 3 kHz, and 4 kHz. The highest coefficients of regression and determination were 1. 026 for 4 kHz and R 2 = 0. 663 for 3 kHz, respectively. The coefficient of regression was highest (= 0. 995) for the mean of PTA thresholds for 3 kHz and 4 kHz. The coefficient of determination was highest for the mean of PTA thresholds for 1, 2, 3 and 4 kHz (R 2 = 0. 732). Multiple regression analysis showed a significant relation between the AB...|$|E

40|$|UNLABELLED: The aim of {{this work}} {{was to assess the}} hearing {{impairment}} in patients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN). Elevation of pure tone thresholds in the presence of preserved inner ear function as suggested by cochlear microphonics (CM), absent or markedly abnormal brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), and elevation of speech perception out of proportion to the pure tone loss were found in the patients. From 28 members of a Gypsy family, we examined two siblings aged 31 and 30 years and their nephew aged 20 years, all suffering from HMSN that was associated with auditory neuropathy. All three affected members with difficulty of understanding speech had following investigations: pure tone and <b>speech</b> <b>audiograms,</b> BAEP, cochlear microphonics, and nerve conduction studies (NCV). RESULTS: the older two siblings had a flat 80 dB audiogram, whereas the younger one has flat 20 dB audiogram on the Lt. ear and 30 dB audiogram on the Rt. ear. All had no speech comprehension and no BAEP. Two patients had preserved cochlear microphonics on one ear. Peripheral nerves were electrically not elicitable, however, {{at the beginning of the}} disease nerve conduction was slow. CONCLUSION: in all three affected members with distinct clinical picture of HMSN their hearing impairment was proved to be due to severe auditory neuropathy in the presence of preserved inner ear function...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{hearing impairment}} and cochlear function in non-ocular Stickler syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: Multifamily study. PATIENTS & METHODS: Ten patients {{from two different}} families with non-ocular Stickler syndrome (Stickler syndrome type 3) were included. Six members of the first family and {{four members of the}} second family participated in this study. Otorhinolaryngologic examinations were performed. Pure-tone and <b>speech</b> <b>audiograms</b> were obtained. Longitudinal analysis was performed. Psychophysical measurements, including loudness scaling, gap detection, difference limen for frequency and speech perception in noise were administered to assess cochlear function at a deeper level. RESULTS: Affected individuals in the first family were carriers of a heterozygous splice donor mutation in the COL 11 A 2 gene. Affected individuals in the second family were carriers of a novel heterozygous missense mutation in COL 11 A 2. Both families showed bilateral, non-progressive hearing impairment with childhood onset. The severity of the hearing impairment exhibited inter- and intrafamilial variability and was mostly mild to moderate. The results of the psychophysical measurements were similar to those previously published for DFNA 8 / 12 (TECTA) and DFNA 13 (COL 11 A 2) patients and thus consistent with an intra-cochlear conductive hearing impairment. This is in line with the theory that mutations in COL 11 A 2 affect tectorial membrane function. CONCLUSION: Hearing impairment in non-ocular Stickler syndrome is characterized by non-progressive hearing loss, present since childhood, and mostly mild to moderate in severity. Psychophysical measurements in non-ocular Stickler patients were suggestive of intra-cochlear conductive hearing impairment...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the outcome and possible complications of subtotal petrosectomy (SP) for Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) device surgery in a tertiary referral center. A secondary objective was the evaluation of hearing results in a subgroup of subjects who received the VSB device. Between 2009 and early 2011, 22 adult subjects with chronic otitis media (COM) underwent a SP, blind sac closure of the external auditory canal and abdominal fat obliteration to facilitate the application of an active middle ear implant (AMEI) in a staged procedure. Indications consisted of mixed hearing loss after previous tympanomastoplasty and failure of hearing rehabilitation with a hearing aid or bone conduction device in COM. Pre- and postoperative pure-tone audiograms were analyzed in respect to deterioration of inner ear function, unaided and aided (hearing aid, bone-anchored hearing aid and VSB) <b>speech</b> <b>audiograms</b> were compared to verify improvements in communications skills and functional gains. Incidence and type of complications were reviewed. No significant change was observed regarding mean bone conduction thresholds after the first stage procedure. Some minor wound healing problems were noted. Speech perception using the VSB (n =  16) showed a mean aided speech discrimination at 65 -dB SPL of 75  % [standard deviation (SD) 28. 7], at 80 -dB SPL of 90  % (SD 25. 1). Our results suggest that for selected patients with open mastoid cavities and chronic middle ear disease, SP with abdominal fat obliteration is an effective and safe technique to facilitate safe AMEI placement. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{characterize}} and {{distinguish the}} types of sensorineural hearing impairment (SNHI) that occur in hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy Type 1 a (HMSN- 1 a) and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), which are caused by deletion or frameshift mutation. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Ambulatory patients in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twelve patients with HMSN- 1 a due to a duplication of the PMP 22 gene on chromosome 17 p 11. 2, 16 patients with HNPP due to the common PMP 22 deletion (HNPP del), and 11 HNPP patients with a frame shift mutation (heterozygous PMP 22 G-insertion) (HNPP mut), all confirmed by molecular genetic analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Pure-tone <b>audiograms</b> and <b>speech</b> <b>audiograms</b> were obtained. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of cross-sectional analysis comprising linear regression of hearing threshold on age. RESULTS: Pure-tone audiograms showed mild to moderate SNHI, predominant at the low and the high frequencies. SNHI showed significant progression by approximately 0. 4 dB per year at 0. 25 to 4 kHz and up to 1 to 2 dB per year at 4 to 8 kHz. Patients with HMSN- 1 a had substantial, presumably congenital, SNHI but did not show significant progression beyond presbyacusis. Patients with HNPP showed postnatal onset at age 11 years with progression of SNHI in excess of presbyacusis by 0. 4 dB per year. All three types of neuropathy showed normal speech recognition. CONCLUSIONS: All three types of neuropathy showed SNHI with normal speech recognition. HMSN- 1 a showed stable SNHI without progression beyond presbyacusis. HNPP showed progression beyond presbyacusis with postnatal onset. The differences in SNHI {{may be explained by}} the differences in PMP 22 expression. The progressive SNHI in HNPP might be explained by the liability for exogenous factors associated with this disorder...|$|R
40|$|A {{group of}} 16 children, aged from 8 to 14 years, with {{learning}} disabilities, were studied {{by means of}} a series of conventional and sensitized audiological tests, including recording of the late cognitive electrical responses (P- 300).

40|$|Labyrinthitis with vestibulocochlear {{dysfunction}} {{in chronic}} inflammatory bowl {{disease is a}} rare but well described manifestation or complication. The diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities and limitations of this inflammatory otopathy are presented and discussed {{in the context of}} a case report. A bilateral loss of vestibular function and sensorineural hearing loss occurred in a 26 -year-old male patient with previously diagnosed Crohn's disease. He was treated with immune suppressive therapy during the onset and development of cochleovestibular symptoms. Diagnostic tests included pure tone <b>audiograms,</b> <b>speech</b> audiometry, caloric tests, VEMPs, and MRI. Therapy included azathioprine, corticosteroids (systemic and intratympanic), monoclonal antibodies, and cochlear implants. Despite immunosuppressive therapy including monoclonal antibodies, the patient progressively lost his hearing. Finally, bilateral cochlear implantation was carried out with good results. The treatment of patients with systemic inflammatory or autoimmune disease affecting the cochlear-vestibular organ is challenging. An interdisciplinary approach is needed. In cases of bilateral deafness, cochlear implantation is a satisfactory treatment and should not be delayed unnecessarily...|$|R
40|$|Objective and {{importance}} The candidacy for cochlear implant {{has changed over}} time and includes people with lesser degrees of hearing loss. Candidacy {{is based on the}} pure-tone audiometry thresholds and aided <b>speech</b> testing. The <b>audiogram</b> does not reflect the actual problems faced by an individual with and without hearing aids. The variability in the actual functional hearing and the pure-tone thresholds makes it difficult for the patients whose audiogram is borderline for cochlear implantation and they are not deriving enough benefit from hearing aids. Case presentation Retrospective report of the audiological findings of two patients whose cochlear implant funding was refused based on their audiogram. In both instances, they were not deriving benefit from hearing aids and the pure-tone audiometry results were just outside the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines at 4 kHz. Conclusions Cochlear implant candidacy should be individually based and needs to take into account other factors such as work, quality of life, and social impact rather than just adhering to the pure-tone audiometry guidelines. These guidelines should not be considered as strict criteria nor used to deny the benefit of a cochlear implant at the earliest possible opportunity. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{many people}} use {{portable}} players to enrich their daily life with enjoyable music. However, in noisy environments, the player volume is often set to extremely high levels {{in order to}} drown out the intense ambient noise and satisfy the appetite for music. Extensive and inappropriate usage of portable music players might cause subtle damages in the auditory system, which are not behaviorally detectable in {{an early stage of}} the hearing impairment progress. Here, by means of magnetoencephalography, we objectively examined detrimental effects of portable music player misusage on the population-level frequency tuning in the human auditory cortex. We compared two groups of young people: one group had listened to music with portable music players intensively {{for a long period of}} time, while the other group had not. Both groups performed equally and normally in standard audiological examinations (pure tone <b>audiogram,</b> <b>speech</b> test, and hearing-in-noise test). However, the objective magnetoencephalographic data demonstrated that the population-level frequency tuning in the auditory cortex of the portable music player users was significantly broadened compared to the non-users, when attention was distracted from the auditory modality; this group difference vanished when attention was directed to the auditory modality. Our conclusion is that extensive and inadequate usage of portable music players could cause subtle damages, which standard behavioral audiometric measures fail to detect in an early stage. However, these damages could lead to future irreversible hearing disorders, which would have a huge negative impact on the quality of lif...|$|R
50|$|The {{hospital}} {{was started by}} D. K. Srinivasan, a business person and social worker and C. S. Gangadhar Sharma, a leperologist, as an out-patient clinic in a shed on 5 December 1982. On 14 April 1985, a 10,000 sq ft 3-storied Sri Rama Nama block was opened by the then Vice President of India, R. Venkataraman. The same year, consultation on ENT, gynaecology, and psychiatry and weekly camps on ophthalmologic surgery were started. In June 1988, the hospital started expanding on an adjacent 1.7 acre land. On 14 September 1988, an in-patient wing with 20 beds and a major operation theatre were opened and general surgeries were conducted. On 11 October 1992, a 30,000 sq ft building with 100 beds was opened. In May 1993, maternity and childcare services began. In January 1995, the ophtholmic and geriatric blocks were opened and round-the-clock laboratory became operational. On 1 November 1997, Phaco emulsification unit was started. Elisa reader and ventilator facilities were added in 1998. On 12 February 1999, a haemodialysis unit and <b>speech</b> therapy and <b>audiogram</b> facility were opened.
