40|$|International audienceGeodesy is the {{discipline}} studying the earthâ€™s shape and its gravity field. This tutorial talk highlights {{the interest of}} gravity measurements, which may be interpreted as water mass variations on the continents and provide significant <b>supplementary</b> <b>observation</b> for hydrological studies. We will begin with a short course on the physics behind hydro-geodesy and present the characteristics of both ground-based and satellite geodetic instruments. GRACE is a new satellite, {{the first of its}} kind, able to measure total water storage variations within basins larger than 200 Â 000 kmÂ². Total water storage may be separated into surface water, soil moisture and groundwater contributions. Therefore, there is a growing interest in using GRACE to monitor aquifer storage variations and use it as supplementary information to discharge for hydrological model validation/calibration. Another point of interest is related to the satellite ability to measure the long-term trends in water storage variations, i. e. the impacts of climate change and water management policies. Several case studies will be shown, highlighting the interest of grace in different contexts, including a joint discharge/GRACE calibration of SWAT hydrological model on the entire African continent...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{a recent}} study, a new method for assimilating {{observations}} {{has been proposed}} and applied to a small size nonlinear model. The assimilation is obtained by confining the analysis increment in the unstable subspace of the Observation-Analysis-Forecast (OAF) cycle system, in order to systematically eliminate the dynamically unstable components, present in the forecast error, which are responsible for error growth. Based on the same ideas, applications to more complex models and different, standard and adaptive, observation networks are in progress. Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSE), performed with an atmospheric quasi-geostrophic model, with a restricted "land" area where vertical profiles are systematically observed, and a wider "ocean" area where a single <b>supplementary</b> <b>observation</b> is taken at each analysis time, are reviewed. The adaptive observation is assimilated either with the proposed method or, for comparison, with a 3 -D VAR scheme. The performance of the dynamic assimilation is very good: a reduction of the error of almost {{an order of magnitude}} is obtained in the data void region. The same method is applied to a primitive equation ocean model, where "satellite altimetry" observations are assimilated. In this standard observational configuration, preliminary results show a less spectacular but significant improvement obtained by the introduction of the dynamical assimilation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were made with}} S. C. W. L. roosters {{to test the hypothesis}} that the apparent M. E. value of a feedingstuff is affected by the level of intake. In the first experiment the birds were starved for 18 hr. and then fed varying amounts of whole wheat. Excreta voided during the 24 hr. experimental period was collected quantitatively and assayed for gross energy. Energy voided as excreta increased in a linear manner as the intake of wheat increased. The apparent M. E. value also varied with wheat consumption according to the equation M. E. (kcal. /g.) = 3. 17 X- 8. 5 /X where: 3. 17 kcal. /g. is the true M. E. value of the wheat; 8. 5 kcal. represents the sum of the metabolic fecal and endogenous urinary energy losses; and X is the weight of wheat consumed (g.). A <b>supplementary</b> <b>observation</b> was that the metabolic fecal and endogenous nitrogen excretion of the roosters was 144 mg. /kg. / 24 hr. In the second experiment corn oil was placed in the crops of starved roosters and the energy voided as excreta in 24 hr. was measured. The true M. E. value of the corn oil was 9. 40 kcal. /g. but the apparent value varied with intake. It is therefore concluded that the original hypothesis is correct. The findings of these experiments may explain some of the reported variations in M. E. data. A new approach to the assay for M. E. is proposed...|$|E

Over {{half of the}} forested land in the United States is privately owned. As a majority of this private land is divided into individual or family-owned properties, the decisions made by these owners can have substantial implications for U. S. forests. However, traditional professional outreach efforts have been unsuccessful in reaching the majority of „family forest‟ owners, resulting in a lack of accessible management-related information for this community. This study examined peer-to-peer learning, or peer exchange, as an alternative means of diffusing information throughout the private landowner community, a burgeoning but as yet underrepresented area {{of research in the}} natural resource literature base. Case study methodology was used to examine landowner/community organizations in order to better understand a) how and to what degree peer exchange was fostered within each organization, b) how these organizations influenced landowners and contributed to information dissemination within the landowner community, and c) how the examples provided by these organizational models may be translated to inform future peer exchange and information outreach efforts in the family forest landowner community, specifically. Qualitative data were collected from five diverse landowner organizations in the United States and Australia via 61 in-depth interviews with organizational leaders and landowning members, as well as from <b>supplementary</b> <b>observation</b> of group functions. Results from analysis revealed a variety of strong common themes across cases. The organizations utilized peer exchange and social incentives in concert with professional resources to foster credible, appealing atmospheres and comfortable learning environments. Participants gained access to networks of both practical, peer-based information as well as technical, professional-based information. Additionally, organizations increased participant awareness of landowning issues and provided assistance in refinement and accomplishment of management goals. The results of this research can inform future efforts in fostering peer exchange and information dissemination in the private landowner community, with specific considerations for practitioners seeking alternative information channels for reaching the masses of family forest owners in the United States...|$|E

Analysis {{was performed on the}} diagnosis of schizophrenia alone and on schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder (milder phenotype) combined. The models used were the transmission probability model and the mixed model. Because the disease is associated with reduced fertility, all likelihoods were calculated conditional on parental phenotypes. However, compatibility of the mating-type distribution predicted by each model with the observed was also examined. In all analyses, results suggested consistency with genetic transmission. In the analysis of schizophrenia alone, discrimination among models was difficult. In the analysis including the milder phenotypes, all single-locus models without polygenic background were excluded, while pure polygenic inheritance could not be eliminated. The polygenic model also gave good agreement with <b>supplementary</b> <b>observations</b> (lifetime disease incidences, mating-type distribution, and monozygotic twin concordance).

The crest heights were almost perfectly Rayleigh distributed over the entire range of observation. The distribution of the wave heights is close to a Rayleigh distribution with scale factor 0. 88 (rather than 1 as in the conventional Rayleigh distribution), but it is better approximated with a Weibull distribution with a shape factor 2. 162 (rather than 2, as for a Rayleigh distribution). <b>Supplementary</b> <b>observations</b> with laser altimeters in the North Sea (10, 000 waves) showed nearly identical results in the range of overlap (the normalised crest heights were slightly higher, showing a nonlinear behaviour) ...|$|R

40|$|Astrometric and radial-velocity planet detections track {{very similar}} motions, and one {{generally}} expects that the statistical {{properties of the}} detections would also be similar after they are scaled to the signal-to-noise ratio of the underlying observations. I show that this expectation is realized for periods small compared to {{the duration of the}} experiment P/T ~ 1. At longer periods, the fact that models of astrometric observations must take account of an extra nuisance parameter causes the mass error to begin deteriorating at P/T ~ 0. 8, as compared to P/T ~ 1. 0 for RV. Moreover, the deterioration is much less graceful. This qualitative difference carries over to the more complicated case in which the planet is being monitored {{in the presence of a}} distant companion that generates an approximately uniform acceleration.

Sex-roles, parental behaviour and time-budgets in each phase are described and quantified, and juvenile growth and behavioural development are described. Fledgling productivity was 1. 2 young per pair (1. 8 per successful pair) in 2005 (n = 6 pairs), and 0. 8 young per pair per year in 2005 – 06 (n = 12 pair-years). The breeding diet at two nests near Armidale (on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales) in 2005 was 74 % mammals (56 % Rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus), 22 % birds and 4 % reptiles by number, and 89 % mammals (40 % Rabbits), 11 % birds and < 1 % reptiles by biomass (n = 49 prey items). Hunting and attack behaviour are described; 80 % of 10 observed strikes by experienced breeding adults were successful...|$|R
