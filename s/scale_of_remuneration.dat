Thus in the United States the rate of wages is high, whether [...] {{measured in}} gold or in the most important articles of the [...] laborer’s consumption—a fact which proves that the cost of [...] producing gold, {{as well as that of}} producing those other [...] commodities, is low in the United States.... I would ask [...] [objectors] to consider what are the true causes of the high [...] <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> American industry. It will surely be admitted [...] that, in the last resort, these resolve themselves into the one [...] great fact of its high productive power.... I must, therefore, [...] contend that the high <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> industrial <b>remuneration</b> in America, [...] instead of being evidence of a high cost of production in that [...] country, is distinctly evidence of a low cost of production—of a [...] low cost of production, that is to say, in the first place, of [...] gold, and, in the next, of the commodities which mainly constitute [...] the real wages of labor—a description which embraces at once the [...] most important raw materials of industry and the most important [...] articles of general consumption. As regards commodities not [...] included in this description, the criterion of wages stands in no [...] constant relation of any kind to their cost, and is, therefore, [...] simply irrelevant to the point at issue. And now we may see what [...] this claim for protection to American industry, founded on the [...] high <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> American <b>remuneration,</b> really comes to: it is a [...] demand for special legislative aid in consideration of the [...] possession of special industrial facilities—a complaint, in short, [...] against the exceptional bounty of nature.|$|R

Very little research, if any, provides information on the skills and competencies <b>of</b> <b>Remuneration</b> Committee members. The rationale for this study emanates from the researcher's desire to look at Remuneration Committees beyond executive pay and the link to company performance, and instead focus on reviewing skills and competencies of its members. The primary data collection method was semi-structured interviews. The sample consisted <b>of</b> 16 <b>Remuneration</b> Committee members and Remuneration Consultants. Data was analysed using the Atlas ti. system. Empirical evidence shows that corporate governance, objectivity, business acumen and knowledge of human resources are must have skills and competencies <b>of</b> <b>Remuneration</b> Committee members.

This study provides an analysis <b>of</b> the existing <b>remuneration</b> package structure for public servants in Latvia and, based on a theoretical background, it offers proposals for the improvement <b>of</b> a <b>remuneration</b> package structure that aims to ensure its functionality and to provide possibilities to motivate employees. As a result of this analysis, the general and motivating parts <b>of</b> a <b>remuneration</b> package were defined, the last being divided into fixed and variable parts. An examination of the appropriate legislation has lead to the conclusion that the present combination of financial elements <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> has neither a clearly fixed, nor a clearly variable nature. Two alternative structures for a remuneration package have been proposed, namely, a fixed remuneration package structure and a remuneration package with a significant proportion of variable part. In the case of implementation <b>of</b> a fixed <b>remuneration</b> package structure it is forecast that all transparency and fairness (equality) principles will be met, stability <b>of</b> the <b>remuneration</b> system will be ensured, and, as well, a positive image of the public sector within the labour market will be sustained. The implementation <b>of</b> a <b>remuneration</b> package with significant variable part should ensure a stronger link between the level <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> and job output of employee, as well as to provide more flexible possibilities to stimulate employees for immediate actions. For the practical implementation of both proposed alternatives and for a revision <b>of</b> current <b>remuneration</b> levels in nominal terms, the authors propose the utilisation of an employee job output and remuneration level correlation matrix, thus ensuring an optimal equilibrium <b>of</b> output and <b>remuneration</b> and a targeted usage <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> funds...|$|R
