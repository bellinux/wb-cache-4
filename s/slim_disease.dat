40|$|About 12 % of {{the adult}} Dutch {{population}} is obese (Quetelet Index > or = 30 kg/m 2). The prevalence has roughly doubled over the past 20 years. Obesity is strongly associated {{with a number of}} chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, increased healthcare costs and a loss of productivity. Obesity is always the result of a mismatch between energy intake and energy expenditure. Foods with a high percentage of energy derived from fat are associated with weight gain, particularly {{when the rest of the}} energy is obtained from products containing little dietary fibre. Foods with a high content of refined added sugars or starch might be unfavourable with respect to the energy balance and the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular <b>diseases.</b> <b>Slimming</b> diets should aim for a gradual and sustained weight loss of about 10 % of the initial weight over a period of six months, followed by weight maintenance over the next two years. Physical activity is an essential component of a weight loss strategy. Moderate sustained weight loss is associated with a strong reduction in the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in people with impaired glucose tolerance...|$|R
40|$|Arguably the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has presented}} {{one of the}} greatest scientific, humanitarian, and cultural challenges of our time. The Acquired Immunodeficiency Disease Syndrome (AIDS) was first reported in homosexual men in the United States in 1981 and was then seen in hemophiliacs, Haitians, prisoners, and intravenous drug addicts. <b>Slim</b> <b>disease,</b> as it was then called, was recognized shortly afterward in Africa. Intense scientific endeavors resulted in the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) being identified as the cause of AIDS in 1983. So how did the already marginalized person, their family, and community respond to this mysterious and unpredictable lethal infectious disease? Given enough time and resources, altruism, knowledge, and tools have been able to overcome denial, fear, prejudice, and competing demands. The evolutionary process has provided us a hierarchy of successful and interdependent biologic, cultural, scientific, and medical solutions that have given us the weapons to fight this most formidable biological adversary. Most importantly, our social and altruistic instincts and capacity for rapid cultural adaptation have critically underpinned any scientific or medical success. It is a level at which we can all respond to global challenges...|$|E
40|$|Background: Atypical and {{exceptional}} {{clinical presentation}} of full blown AIDS may {{be observed in}} sub-Saharan Africa. We report herein {{the case of a}} Central African 37 -year-old male patient presented with full blown AIDS, a typical picture of <b>slim</b> <b>disease</b> with marked cachexia and wasting faces. In addition, the patient was suffering from very extensive genital ulcer with complete loss of substance of the genitalia. Methods: Extensive histological and microbiological analysis of the genital lesion was carried out. Results: HIV- 1 serology was positive, the HIV- 1 RNA plasma viral load was 5. 3 log copies/ml and CD 4 T cell count was 1 per µL. Search for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum and urine was negative by direct microscopic examination with Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Testing for syphilis serology was negative. Direct immunofluorescence detection on genital ulcer scraping was negative for Chlamydia trachomatis and Treponema pallidum. Furthermore, the infections with Haemophilus ducreyi and Chlamydia trachomatis were excluded by PCR on genital swabs. Genital PCR was positive for herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2. Marked improvement was observed within 6 weeks after starting empirical therapy including first-line antiretroviral therapy, cotrimoxazole, doxycycline and valacyclovir, with progressive healing of genital ulcer and negativity of HSV PCR...|$|E
40|$|The early 1980 s {{brought the}} ex-plosion of {{information}} availability {{and the emergence}} of Human Im-munodeficiency Virus (HIV) in-fection. Advances in information technology enabled humans to get access to information instantly. On June 5, 1981, Morbidity and Mortal-ity Weekly Report published a rare type of pneumonia (pneumocystis carinii) in 5 previously healthy ho-mosexual men in Los Angeles. 1 On {{the other side of the}} world, in Uganda, the emergence of a se-vere wasting syndrome locally known as “slim dis-ease ” was reported. What was originally perceived as a rumor turned to a stigma, fear, an epidemic and eventually a tragedy. The rare reported cases with respiratory diseases in Los Angeles were lat-er marked as the beginning of the HIV epidemic. <b>Slim</b> <b>disease</b> was soon found to be associated with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), an advanced stage of HIV infection. In 1984, LAV virus was discovered in France, and a year later HTLV III was isolated in the U. S. Both viruses were later found to be the same virus and renamed HIV. In 1999, HIV was found to be a variation of the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) found in a chimpanzee species in West Africa. At the beginning, not much was known about the etiology of HIV infection and its mode of trans-mission. Because the disease was more prevalent among men who had sex with men, sex work-ers and IV drug users, public anxiety grew and led to fear, prejudice and stigmatization. Ryan White, a 13 year old hemophiliac boy with AIDS, was banned from school, and gay men and drug users were seen as having brought the disease upon themselves. What was perceived as “a gay epidemic ” started turning up in children, blood transfusion recipients and heterosexuals. On a global level and at the World Health Organization summits, the need for every country to have a supportive and non-discriminatory social environ-ment was recognized. The U. S. Public Health Ser-vice added AIDS to its list of diseases for whic...|$|E
40|$|AIDS is an {{acquired}} immunodeficiency syndrome defined by a severe depletion of T cells and over 20 conventional degenerative and neoplastic diseases. In the U. S. and Europe, AIDS correlates to 95 % with risk factors, such as about 8 years of promiscuous male homosexuality, intravenous drug use, or hemophilia. Since AIDS also correlates with antibody to a retrovirus, confirmed in about 40 % of American cases, it has been hypothesized that this virus causes AIDS by killing T cells. Consequently, the virus was termed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and antibody to HIV {{became part of the}} definition of AIDS. The hypothesis that HIV causes AIDS is examined in terms of Koch's postulates and epidemiological, biochemical, genetic, and evolutionary conditions of viral pathology. HIV does not fulfill Koch's postulates: (i) free virus is not detectable in most cases of AIDS; (ii) virus can only be isolated by reactivating virus in vitro from a few latently infected lymphocytes among millions of uninfected ones; (iii) pure HIV does not cause AIDS upon experimental infection of chimpanzees or accidental infection of healthy humans. Further, HIV violates classical conditions of viral pathology. (i) Epidemiological surveys indicate that the annual incidence of AIDS among antibody-positive persons varies from nearly 0 to over 10 %, depending critically on nonviral risk factors. (ii) HIV is expressed in {{less than or equal to}} 1 of every 10 (4) T cells it supposedly kills in AIDS, whereas about 5 % of all T cells are regenerated during the 2 days it takes the virus to infect a cell. (iii) If HIV were the cause of AIDS, it would be the first virus to cause a disease only after the onset of antiviral immunity, as detected by a positive "AIDS test. " (iv) AIDS follows the onset of antiviral immunity only after long and unpredictable asymptomatic intervals averaging 8 years, although HIV replicates within 1 to 2 days and induces immunity within 1 to 2 months. (v) HIV supposedly causes AIDS by killing T cells, although retroviruses can only replicate in viable cells. In fact, infected T cells grown in culture continue to divide. (vi) HIV is isogenic with all other retroviruses and does not express a late, AIDS-specific gene. (vii) If HIV were to cause AIDS, it would have a paradoxical, country-specific pathology, causing over 90 % Pneumocystis pneumonia and Kaposi sarcoma in the U. S. but over 90 % <b>slim</b> <b>disease,</b> fever, and diarrhea in Africa. (viii) It is highly improbable that within the last few years two viruses (HIV- 1 and HIV- 2) that are only 40 % sequence-related would have evolved that could both cause the newly defined syndrome AIDS. Also, viruses are improbable that kill their only natural host with efficiencies of 50 - 100 %, as is claimed for HIVs. It is concluded that HIV is not sufficient for AIDS and that it may not even be necessary for AIDS because its activity is just as low in symptomatic carriers as in asymptomatic carriers. The correlation between antibody to HIV and AIDS does not prove causation, because otherwise indistinguishable diseases are now set apart only on the basis of this antibody. I propose that AIDS is not a contagious syndrome caused by one conventional virus or microbe. No such virus or microbe would require almost a decade to cause primary disease, nor could it cause the diverse collection of AIDS diseases. Neither would its host range be as selective as that of AIDS, nor could it survive if it were as inefficiently transmitted as AIDS. Since AIDS is defined by new combinations of conventional diseases, it may be caused by new combinations of conventional pathogens, including acute viral or microbial infections and chronic drug use and malnutrition. The long and unpredictable intervals between infection with HIV and AIDS would then reflect the thresholds for these pathogenic factors to cause AIDS diseases, instead of an unlikely mechanism of HIV pathogenesis...|$|E
