50|$|Hypnosis is one {{of several}} {{techniques}} that athletes may employ to accomplish their <b>sporting</b> <b>goals</b> and it is equally beneficial to coaches as well as athletes. Hypnosis may do for the mind what physical activity does for the body of an athlete. The theory behind sports hypnosis is that relaxation is key to improved sporting performance and athletes may perform better if they are able to relax mentally and focus on the task at hand. Hypnosis may help athletes attain relaxation during practise and competition. Hypnosis may also help to control anxiety and manage stress in athletes. Athletes may develop auto-response to preestablished stimuli which is geared towards achieving optimal performance levels. Sports Hypnosis can also eliminate phobic responses, such as 'Trigger Freeze' in the Clay Pigeon Shooter, 'Target Panic' in the Archer and Fears of further injury in sports people following injury.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} assessing and questioning the perceived 'politicisation' of the non-racial South African Council on Sport (SACOS) {{in the late}} 1970 s and early 1980 s. Through an institutional case study of the organisation's largest provincial football association (the Western Province Football Board (WPFB)) and its implementation of the ostensibly political Double Standards resolution, it re-examines the concept that politics captured the sports movement. Instead {{it is argued that}} sporting impetuses based in a desire for institutional survival retained primacy within the Board's decision making. In fact primarily, political ideologies were utilised to deliver <b>sporting</b> <b>goals</b> and not the other way around. This analysis is then extrapolated to demonstrate far-reaching conclusions around the relationship of sport and politics, Coloured identity and the meaning of the anti-Apartheid movement...|$|E
40|$|Motherhood and {{participation}} in elite sport have traditionally been viewed as at odds with each other. However, mothers competing {{at the pinnacle of}} sport are becoming more common. Despite such trends, motherhood often remains invisible and taboo within the sphere of elite sport and little research has addressed athletes who are mothers. In order to explore popular accounts of motherhood and elite sport, we examined 326 media reports of the case of Keli Lane, an Australian water polo player who was convicted of murdering her infant in order to pursue her <b>sporting</b> <b>goals.</b> We draw on a social constructionist and critical approach to discursive analysis in order to explore repeated patterns of constructions of athlete identity and motherhood. We argue that within these media accounts, the identities of 'elite athlete' and 'mother' were depicted as mutually exclusive. Morever, the role of the broader context of elite sporting culture and organisations in influencing the combination of motherhood and elite sport participation was rendered invisible within these accounts. The implications for female athletes, especially mothers, are discussed. Suzanne Cosh and Shona Crab...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This book {{analyses}} {{the economic}} situation of elite athletes in Germany. The athletes under investigation are from non-professionalised sports and receive funds from the German Sports Aid Foundation. An online survey was conducted to assess the income, life, and career situation of elite athletes. The sample was representative for the supported athletes with regard to age, gender, and squad level. With regard to the career situation, the results provide evidence on the sporting success and <b>sporting</b> <b>goals</b> of athletes {{as well as on}} the time spent on sport and the intention to drop out of the sport. With regard to the income situation, the findings indicate that many athletes have to work to finance their sporting career. The average brut and net income for athletes as well as hourly wages for athletes in several sports are provided and compared to other professions. Moreover, monthly sport-related expenditure and monthly available income are presented. The results section finishes with the athletes' agreement to a list of statements, their level of satisfaction with several aspects, the perceived intellectual support from several institutions, and some expectations from policy-makers. The book contains unique empirical findings on the situation of elite athletes in Germany. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|The current ‘holy grail’ for {{our health}} and {{well-being}} centres around the search for, and establishment of, a work/life balance. For many individuals, {{this appears to be}} an ever-elusive goal – forever slipping from our grasp as we juggle the day-to-day battle for our attention and time from an array of sources. When we add the word ‘Women’ to this mix, often the number of sources related to these demands multiplies in alignment with the number of roles we fill. To take this to even another level, consider the addition of the words ‘Sport’ or ‘Elite Athlete’ to ‘Women’ and ‘Work/Life Balance’, and the search for the ‘holy grail’ becomes more literal! Many sportswomen at the elite level face significant challenges in balancing working to support themselves and/or their families, studying to lay the foundations of a post-sport career, (often) spending the equivalent of full-time hours training towards their <b>sporting</b> <b>goals,</b> and additionally investing in the things that are important for them outside of these two areas – the ‘Life’ component. Getting the work/life balance ‘balanced’ has been suggested to be a key component of investing in our {{health and well-being}}. The same is applicable to sportswomen, with the added suggestion that if the balance between work/sport/life is achieved, this can positively impact upon sporting performance itself. These ideas and observations will be explored via experience within the Australian elite sporting environment from a psychologist’s perspective, with questions and invitations for further discussion...|$|E
40|$|Aim: This {{investigation}} examined teachers’ {{perspectives of}} issues faced by high performance school-age athletes in balancing school and training. This study examined a complementary but different view about {{the training and}} study issues identified by school-age athletes themselves and was {{designed to provide a}} broader insight into this problematic area. Methods: This research {{was part of a larger}} project where 19 high performance school age athletes were interviewed about their experiences in juggling school and sporting demands. Additionally 10 teachers who had or were teaching high performance schoolage athletes were also interviewed about their views on how these student athletes cope with school and sporting commitments. Interview data from teachers were analysed using NVivo 10. 1 and SPSS descriptives. Results: Although teachers were empathetic to student athlete issues, the teachers’ perspectives about the problems faced by high performance school age athletes in balancing study and sport differed to the issues expressed by the students themselves. In particular teachers daily classroom observations of school-age athletes revealed that the main issues for student athletes related to balancing timetables, student tiredness, being time poor, and the need for students to set short term goals. Notably absent from teachers’ responses were: a lack of their awareness about the nutritional requirements of student athletes and their lack of any systematic monitoring strategies to gauge fatigue and physical stress levels in student athletes. Conclusion: This research identifies observational issues for teachers in their management and support of high performance school-aged athletes. It provides strategies teachers can use to monitor student athletes’ wellbeing and also identifies some supportive strategies teachers can use to help these school-age athletes’ cope with their educational and <b>sporting</b> <b>goals.</b> Supporting data: [URL]...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} lived experiences of professional Oceanian sports migrants employed in rugby league in the United Kingdom (UK), {{and the impact}} migration had upon player identities. The migrant pathway from Oceania to the UK is well established in rugby. However, the experiences of rugby league players have not previously been studied. Moreover, rugby league is a sport in which debate concerning the merits of employing labour migrants from Oceania is prevalent and ongoing due {{to the success of}} international antipodean teams, particularly Australia. The study was guided by figurational principles in order to gain insight into sports labour migration in rugby league as part of wider globalisation processes. The study utilised data obtained from 14 semi-structured interviews and 26 questionnaires completed by professional rugby league players in the premier European club competition, the ‘Superleague. ’ Specific issues facing this group of migrant professionals were investigated. Motivations to migrate were intensely personal and multi-faceted. Although finance featured, personal development and <b>sporting</b> <b>goals</b> were often paramount. However, player control career choices were often limited, associated with poor preparation. This resulted in considerable personal and cultural challenges, particularly among players without European ancestry. The study also highlighted how the identities of ethnic subgroups within a more general group of labour migrants can emerge and be strengthened as a result of migration. Furthermore, the study highlighted how the issues presented by migrating in sport can affect some groups of migrants in an entirely unique manner. In particular, Pacific Islanders, Maoris and Papua New Guineans found the cultural adaptation required of a move to England challenging. These differences between subgroups are considered in light of previous work on a labour migrant typology presented by Stead and Maguire (2000) which has implications for future research into the global sports migration phenomena...|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{is a lack}} of {{understanding}} of young men's perspectives in obesity-related research. This study aims to: (1) identify young men's perceived motivators and barriers in adopting healthy eating and physical activity behaviours, and (2) explore any differences in responses by weight status categories. Methods: Ten focus groups (32 - 63 minutes; 3 - 9 participants per group) were conducted with 61 young men (BMI: 25. 3 ± 5. 1 kg/m², aged: 18 - 25 years) from the Hunter region, New South Wales, Australia. There were 35 (57. 4 %) healthy weight men and 26 (42. 6 %) overweight/ obese men. Three groups were with healthy weight participants, three with overweight/obese participants and four with mixed-BMI participants. Sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed. Data analysis was conducted by an independent researcher using NVIVO 10. Results: Motivators for healthy eating grouped into four themes: physical health (e. g. to live longer), sport or performance (e. g. to support their <b>sporting</b> <b>goals),</b> physical appearance (e. g. sexual attractiveness) and social influences (e. g. societal expectations to eat healthy), while key motivators for physical activity were: physical appearance (e. g. sexual attractiveness), social inclusion (e. g. making friends), physical and mental health (e. g. relieve stress) and improvements for sport or performance (e. g. improve fitness). Themes for key barriers to eating healthy were: intrinsic (e. g. perceived effort to adopt healthy eating), logistic (e. g. cost), and social factors (e. g. peer influence), while busy lifestyles (e. g. lack of time), logistic (e. g. cost), cognitive-emotional (e. g. feelings of inferiority) and social factors (e. g. family upbringing) were key barriers for physical activity. Responses varied little by BMI status. Conclusion: This research emphasises the importance of consulting young men when developing healthy lifestyle programs that aim to promote healthy eating and physical activity in young men. Future research is needed to identify the most effective ways to address their motivators and barriers in intervention research...|$|E
40|$|High-level {{sports are}} cadenced by {{multiple}} deadlines at regular intervals, while operating variously in the short, medium and long-term. In this context, {{we examine the}} sense of time among fencers of the "Pôle France". The purpose is to understand how they project themselves into the future, and how it impacts the ways they manage their time in everyday life. In a first part, we show that the fencers anticipate the future {{in a variety of}} ways. The different levels of scope and accuracy of their projections allows identifying three profiles of athletes. Next, we underline that the pursuit of <b>sporting</b> <b>goals</b> induces a complete reorganization of the time, linked to the necessity for the fencers to manage their physical capital. This often implies a long and strategic learning process. Lastly, we highlight the difficulties linked to the articulation of temporalities related to sporting careers on the one hand, and studies or professional careers on the other hand. Le sport de haut niveau est rythmé par une succession d’échéances qui interviennent à intervalles réguliers, tout en se déployant sur des échelles de temps variables, à court, moyen et long termes. Dans ce contexte, cet article interroge le rapport au temps des escrimeurs du Pôle France. L’objectif est de comprendre à la fois comment ils s’inscrivent dans l’avenir, et comment cette inscription dans l’avenir impacte la gestion du temps dont ils disposent au quotidien. Dans un premier temps, nous montrons que les escrimeurs anticipent leur avenir sportif de différentes manières; la portée et la clarté de leurs projections permettant d’identifier trois profils d’athlètes. Puis nous soulignons que la poursuite des objectifs sportifs induit une réorganisation complète du temps autour de la gestion du capital corporel, ce qui nécessite un apprentissage parfois long et stratégique. Enfin, nous mettons en évidence les difficultés inhérentes à l’articulation des temporalités relevant des parcours sportifs, d’une part, des études et des carrières professionnelles, d’autre part...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This {{investigation}} {{extended the}} goal striving literature by examining motives for two goals being pursued simultaneously. Specifically, it examined how student athletes’ autonomous and controlled motives for their <b>sporting</b> and academic <b>goals</b> {{were associated with}} inter-goal facilitation and interference. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Methods: Student athletes (n = 204) from universities in the United Kingdom identified their most important <b>sporting</b> and academic <b>goals.</b> They then rated their autonomous and controlled motives for these goals and completed questionnaires assessing inter-goal facilitation and interference. Results: Using a person-centered approach via latent class analysis, we identified three distinct classes of goal motives.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was threefold. Primarily it was to {{identify}} the underlying motivational influences determining why mature age men and women continue playing sport competitively, long after they have reached their peak performance level. Secondly, the study sought to ascertain whether there was a change in specific temperament attributes, such as competitiveness, as Squash players became older, and whether any changes were restricted primarily to the sporting environment, or did changes pervade other areas ofthe individuals' lives. The third purpose of the study was to design a new measurement instrument for use in effectively identifying the primary motivations of mature age squash participants within Australia. The research study comprised a multi-system methodology which allowed for triangulation analysis of results. It involved both quantitative and qualitative methodological approaches, with four phases of investigation. The first phase focused on the development of a new motivation measurement instrument, titled Masters Sport Motivation Inventory (MSMI). The second phase involved a Pilot study aimed at implementing the MSMI instrument and evaluating it for validity and reliability, and sampled mature-age participants from nine different sports. The outcomes ofthe Pilot study demonstratedvalidityandreliability ofthe MSMI instrument. The third phase ofthe research comprised the main area ofinvestigation, which was to examine the motivations of Masters squash players in Australia. It used the MSMI instrument to obtain relevant data concerning the motivation of this cohort of sports competitors. The fourth phase comprised in-depth personal interviews from Australian Masters squash players. Interviewees had the opportunity to provide a greater insight into the importance of continued sporting participation into their older adult years. The MSMI data for both the Pilot and Main studies was analysed with the SPSS 15 analysis program. It was determined that there were 12 logical and interpretable motivational factors that were relevant to mature-age sports people and Australian Masters squash players. The results of the quantitative approach generally concurred with the outcomes derived from previous research which has examined the motivations of mature-age athletes, which found that health, enjoyment, fitness and competitiveness were highly relevant motives. In addition, this study extended the outcomes to include other motives viewed as being important to older athletes' sporting aspirations, such as self-awareness, team, aesthetics, skill, stress, recognition, social, and travel, The interview information was examined in two ways. Firstly, it was examined manually by the researcher. The material obtained during the interview process was classified according to groups of responses with similarities in contextual meaning, and the descriptive response data were calculated in the form ofmanual frequencies and percentages. Winning was the primary motive/outcome. Interview responses were also examined via an analysis program called Leximancer, and results revealed that differences in responses among mature-age squash players based on gender, age-class and ability level were minimal. Interview results indicated that many Masters squash players in Australia were still highly competitive, still very determined to win their matches, and still very focused on their goals and game plans. The motives derived from the Masters squash players involved in the qualitative approach generally concurred with the outcomes derived from the quantitative approach, thereby adding consistency and outcome strength to the overall research. The opportunity for mature-age squash participants to elaborate on their feelings, <b>sporting</b> <b>goals</b> and motivations to continue playing their chosen sport enabled a greater depth and wealth ofrelevant information to be examined, and revealed a change in motivational emphasis from health and fitness issues to competitive and win-related issues. The results ofthis research as a whole, in relation to the outcomes obtained from the MSMI instrument, as well as from the personal interviews, differs somewhat from the philosophy of Masters sport, whereby it is assumed and promoted that older athletes primarily participate for fun, enjoyment and social opportunities. The results obtained in this research do not necessarily support this view. Many Australian Masters squash players play to win, and they give their all in an effort to achieve this goal and to reap the pleasure of recognition and rewards for doing so...|$|E
