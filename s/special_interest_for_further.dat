40|$|Learning {{analytics}} is {{a domain}} {{that has been}} constantly evolving throughout recent years due to the acknowledgement of its importance by those using intelligent data, learner-produced data, and analysis models to discover information and social connections for predicting and advising people's learning [1]. Learning analytics may be applied {{in a variety of}} different cases, but their role in understanding the multilingual requirements of users of learning portals is of an outstanding significance. As the adaptation of existing portals in multilingual environments is a cost- and time-consuming aspect of the development of a portal, the outcomes of learning analytics may provide the requirements on which further multilingual services of a portal will be built, ensuring their efficiency. This paper aims to identify and interpret the behavior of users from developing countries in a multilingual learning portal using the log files of the portal by applying the methodology defined in a previous work by Stoitsis et al.

40|$|Hearing {{impairments}} and tinnitus are being reported in an increasing extent from {{employees in the}} preschool. The investigation included 101 employees at 17 preschools in Umeå county, Sweden. Individual noise recordings and stationary recordings in dining rooms and play halls were conducted at two departments per preschool. The effects of noise exposures were carried out through audiometric screenings and by use of questionnaires. The average individual noise exposure was close to 71 dB(A), with individual differences but small differences between the preschools. The noise levels {{in the dining room}} and playing halls were about 64 dB(A), with small differences between the investigated types of rooms and preschools. The hearing loss of the employees was significantly higher for the frequencies tested when compared with an unexposed control group in Sweden. Symptoms of tinnitus were reported among about 31 % of the employees. Annoyance was rated as somewhat to very annoying. The voices of the children were the most annoying noise source. The dB(A) level and fluctuation of the noise exposure were significantly correlated to the number of children per department. The preschool sound environment is complex and our findings indicate that the sound environment is hazardous regarding auditory disorders. The fluctuation of the noise is of <b>special</b> <b>interest</b> <b>for</b> <b>further</b> research...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Clenbuterol, a beta-agonist, can {{dramatically}} reduce pig adipose accumulation at high dosages. However, it {{has been}} banned in pig production because people who eat pig products treated with clenbuterol can be poisoned by the clenbuterol residues. To understand the molecular mechanism for this fat reduction, cDNA microarray, real-time PCR, two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectra were used to study the differential gene expression profiles of pig adipose tissues treated with/without clenbuterol. The objective {{of this research is}} to identify novel genes and physiological pathways that potentially facilitate clenbuterol induced reduction of adipose accumulation. Results Clenbuterol was found to improve the lean meat percentage about 10 percent (P Conclusion Pig fat accumulation was reduced dramatically with clenbuterol treatment. Histological sections and global evaluation of gene expression after administration of clenbuterol in pigs identified profound changes in adipose cells. With clenbuterol stimulation, adipose cell volumes decreased and their gene expression profile changed, which indicate some metabolism processes have been also altered. Although the biological functions of the differentially expressed genes are not completely known, higher expressions of these molecules in adipose tissue might contribute to the reduction of fat accumulation. Among these genes, five lipid metabolism related genes were of <b>special</b> <b>interest</b> <b>for</b> <b>further</b> study, including apoD and apoR. The apoR expression was increased at both the RNA and protein levels. The apoR {{may be one of the}} critical molecules through which clenbuterol reduces fat accumulation. </p...|$|E
40|$|The starch {{of potato}} (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers is a {{renewable}} resource {{and an important}} component of multiple food and non-food products. Optimized starch yield, the product of tuber starch content and tuber yield, is therefore the central selection criterion in breeding programs for starch potatoes. The aim of this work was the detection of diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for starch yield optimization by marker-assisted selection. A novel association mapping population of 282 potato genotypes formed the basis of this thesis. Within a collaborative project with breeders, this population was assembled and phenotyped in replicated field trials in Northern Spain for the starch yield determining traits tuber starch content, tuber yield, weight and number. The population was genotyped for known diagnostic PCR markers, SSR markers and novel SNPs in candidate genes, which were reported in the literature to have a function in starch or yield accumulation in potato or other organisms. In addition, three subpopulations were selected based on the highest (cases) and lowest (controls) trait values for tuber starch content, tuber yield and starch yield. Ninety varieties and breeding clones in total were genome-wide genotyped for 8, 303 SNPs using the SolCAP Potato Array. SNPs with highly significantly different allele frequency between the case-control subpopulations for each trait were selected and genotyped in the entire population. Furthermore, the same case-control subpopulations were genotyped with next-generation RAD sequencing. Highly significant SNPs differing between cases and controls were analyzed for effects on the protein sequence and location in previously known candidate genes. Using a mixed linear model including population structure and kinship for association analysis, 21 diagnostic SNP markers and one insertion-deletion polymorphism were identified in candidate genes for tuber starch and yield-related traits. These associations resulted from the targeted candidate gene approach {{as well as from the}} genome wide case-control study by SolCAP Potato Array genotyping. A set of 430 novel and non-obvious candidate loci for tuber starch content, yield and starch yield was obtained from the RAD sequencing approach. Nine loci were detected in both genome-wide genotyping methods and are of <b>special</b> <b>interest</b> <b>for</b> <b>further</b> analysis. All three applied concepts resulted in the detection of novel marker-trait associations and candidate genes. This study shows the value of combining a knowledge-based association mapping approach with genome-wide discovery of polymorphisms as a tool for the detection of novel and non-obvious candidate genes and markers...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{solution}} of task of optimal control of climate parameters in passengers’ interior of public electric transport is proposed. Optimization of mechatronic system control is provided by criteria of minimization of electric en-ergy consumption and passengers’ comfort level maximization. It is proposed to solve this task using artificial intelligence and progressive multiple criteria deci-sion making methods. Popular Nelder-Mead multiple criteria decision making method is applied. This method gives possibility to find a minimal value of target function. In this case it is a dependence of minimal electric energy consumption on maximal comfort level.

The article presents mathematical problem for using intelligent agents in mechatronics problems for climate parameters optimal control. Idea is to use fuzzy logic and intelligent algorithms to create coordination mechanism for climate parameters control to save electrical energy, and it increases the level of comfort <b>for</b> passengers. A <b>special</b> <b>interest</b> <b>for</b> investigations and <b>further</b> development is devoted to intelligent heating, ventilation and air condition systems allowing more flexible control of the system’s compressor, fan and heater operation, and, therefore, improvement of efficiency and energy saving. This paper provides the mathematical model and algorithm for optimal control of the heating system. The modeling and investigation {{are based on the}} typical architecture of heating, ventilation and air condition system with a traditional application of AC induction motors for driving both compressor and fan of the conditioner. The well-known field-oriented method has been considered for the modeling. Mechatronic process is characterized with several controlled energy flows. Energy flows can be controlled by changing variable characters of low voltage. Thus with the help of electronic devices the flow of energy influences climate parameters in facilities. Several detectors control measurable variables. The purpose is to define the optimal heating, ventilation and air condition system working regime, taking in account priorities of consumers. Deep and detailed investigation of the behaviour of such a system, its operation and running processes requires its generalized mathematic modelling, taking into account all possible regimes of the operation of heater, compressor and fan motors and setting an algorithm of their control in all possible regimes under any condition. The control function is provided with the help of computer which dispatches the control signals according to this algorithm to the power converter which in its turn controls the motors and heater. The fuzzy logic controller developed here is a two-input single-output controller, which makes output control decisions from input users’ fuzzy decisions on comfort level. Value adaptation provided using improved Rastrigin’s adaptation algorithm. Intelligent agent usage gives such advantages for climate parameters control: autonomous fulfillment, interaction with other agents and/or users, surrounding control, ability to adaptation for achieving goals, ability to learning from environment, non sensitivity of mistakes and/or wrong signals, real time work, coordination with other agents and ability to make decision. General mathematical description of one of the modern methods of electric motor control is taken as base of the modelling of the system. The modern systems provide a simultaneous control of the compressor motor and fan motor and even the input factor as well that gives the possibility to improve the efficiency of the system and follow the energy saving. The methods of the problem solving and the structure of problem solving algorithm are given in the article. Algorithm is tested in modeling way. The elaborated system model can be used for sustaining microclimate in different facilities, buildings and public electric transportation. There are main conclusions at the end of article...|$|R
