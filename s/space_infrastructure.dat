25|$|Although {{some items}} of the {{infrastructure}} requirements above can already be easily produced on Earth and would therefore not be very valuable as trade items (oxygen, water, base metal ores, silicates, etc.), other high value items are more abundant, more easily produced, of higher quality, or can only be produced in space.

2500|$|Space {{science and}} {{technology}} have been a government priority for decades. [...] In the late 1980s and 1990s, Brazil invested almost US$1 billion in developing <b>space</b> <b>infrastructure</b> around the National Institute of Space Research (INPE), leading to {{the launch of the}} first scientific satellite built entirely in Brazil in 1993 (SCD-1). Between 1999 and 2014, Brazil and China built a series of five remote sensing satellites for environmental monitoring within the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellites (CBERS) programme. Brazil has now achieved the critical mass of skills and infrastructure required to dominate several space technologies. It is determined to master the complete chain of space technologies, from material sciences, engineering design, remote sensing, aperture-synthetic radars, telecommunications and image processing to propulsion technologies. The joint Argentinian–Brazilian SABIA-MAR mission will be studying ocean ecosystems, carbon cycling, marine habitats mapping, coasts and coastal hazards, inland waters and fisheries. Also under development is the new SARE series designed to expand the active remote observation of Earth through the use of microwave and optical radars.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recent work in {{the field}} of {{middleware}} technology proposes semanticsaware tuplespaces as a tool for coping with the scalability, heterogeneity and dynamism issues arising in distributed environments such as the (Semantic) Web. The fact that (Semantic) Web services communicate by synchronous message exchanges initiated triplespace computing. The aim was to bring the Web’s “persistently publish and read ” paradigm to service computing. Based on experiences with ontologies in traditional middleware we argue that ontology-driven management will be a major asset of semantic tuplespaces compared to traditional ones. In this research we look at ontology-based metadata to enhance semantic <b>space</b> <b>infrastructures</b> to become reflective middleware. 1...|$|R
