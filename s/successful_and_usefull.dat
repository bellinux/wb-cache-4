The condition of the concrete as well as rebar embeded in {{it has to be}} assesed befor taking up any remedial or repair stratergy. Several electrochemical non-destructive techniques are vailable for this purpose. Some of them lead to indirect conclusions and some lead to partial quantification of corrosion. Radiographic technique is one of the promising non-destructive methods for determining the porostity of concrete, voids in the cement grout, rusting of mild steel, rusting of prestressing steel and snapping of prestressing wires. Laboratory and field experiments were carried out on model slabs, beams and concrete structures to study the various aspects of concrete corrosion. A 6 Mev high energy equipment was used for this purpose. Concrete thickness upto 30 cm was radiographed. Suitable safety measures were undertaken while carrying out the above work.

Furthermore, we tried to verify the main hematological and chemistry profile alterations related to the hepatic function, and to investigate the viability of the fragments collected by histopathology. To attain this objective, 21 clinically healthy dogs, weighing between 10 and 15 kg were submitted to hepatic biopsy with forceps connected to the cautery. Cautery was performed by applying radiofrequency energy at 45 watts. Forty-two hepatic biopsies through laparoscopy were conducted in the animals. At group I one hepatic fragment per animal was collected, at group II two hepatic fragments per animal were collected, and at group III three fragments were collected. Hematocrit and alanine-aminotransferase measurements were employed to evaluate the animals at the pre-operative period, at four and six hour post-operative, and at day 30 post-operative.

40|$|The use of high-energy {{heavy ion}} {{irradiation}} to create or modify nanostructured and nanocomposite materials is receiving increasing attention. Above a certain sharp threshold {{in the electronic}} excitation induced by swift heavy ions, an amorphous latent nanotrack (with a few nanometer diameter) is generated in crystalline materials [1, 2]. Spherical metallic nanoparticles, of great interest in nanophotonics, become elongated under swift on irradiation showing very large <b>and</b> <b>usefull</b> plasmon resonance frequency shifts [3]. The amorphous nanotracks can be chemically etched away fabricating in this way unique very long nanopores, which can be further filled with metals and semiconductors. In this work first we describe how the process of amorphous nano-track formation is exploited to generate optical waveguides by ion irradiation in the materials LiNbO 3 and KGW. The method relies on choosing the ion and its energy so as to have the maximum of the electronic stopping power, Se(z), a few microns inside the crystal (as shown in Fig 1) and reaching a value above the threshold for latent track formation (Se,th ≈ 5 keV/nm), while the stopping power is below the threshold at the surface [4].
