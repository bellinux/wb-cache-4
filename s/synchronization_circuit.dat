5000|$|A {{reliable}} {{solution to}} this problem was found in the mid-1970s. Although an arbiter that makes a decision in a fixed time is not possible, one that sometimes takes a little longer in the hard case (close calls) can be made to work. It is necessary to use a multistage <b>synchronization</b> <b>circuit</b> that detects that the arbiter has not yet settled into a stable state. The arbiter then delays processing until a stable state has been achieved. In theory, the arbiter can take an arbitrarily long time to settle, but in practice, it seldom takes more than a few gate delay times. The classic paper is and Woods 1976, which describes how to build a [...] "3 state flip flop" [...] to solve this problem, and 2003, a caution to engineers on common mistakes in arbiter design.|$|E

The modem transmits a rate- 3 / 4 convolutionally encoded 16 -phase-shift keyed (CE 16 PSK) signal over a channel with additive white Gaussian noise. The carrier <b>synchronization</b> <b>circuit</b> is data aided, employing decision feedback. Two estimates of carrier {{phase of the}} received coded signal {{are used in the}} <b>synchronization</b> <b>circuit.</b> The results of computer-simulation tests are presented and used to compare the performances of the system using two phase estimators. It is shown that the carrier-phase estimate of the received coded signal can be improved significantly by combining the phase estimation process with the decoding process of the signal. With the second phase estimator (B) which makes use of a maximum likelihood decoder, half of the possible locking positions are eliminated. As a result, the loop may acquire lock at only 8 possible positions, instead of 16. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Carrier {{frequency}} estimation in {{the conditions}} of a priori uncertainty of signal modulation and parameters is prerequisite for realization of frequency <b>synchronization</b> <b>circuits</b> in software-defined radio. To implement this operation the method of «blind» carrier frequency estimation of radio signals with amplitude, phase and quadrature-amplitude shift keying, which does not require prior information about modulation type, signal and communication channel parameters, is proposed in the article.

This is achieved by implementation of previous clock synchronization and reducing the two-dimensional objective function in one-dimensional. Verification of developed method is carried out by statistical modeling using more than 20 types of phase constellations.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe Wirelessly Distributed Digital Phased Array (WDDPA) {{is an ongoing}} research program at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) which has numerous possible applications in radar and communication systems. The WDDPA incorporates many array elements randomly or nonuniformly in the environment or on a platform. Array elements are synchronized and controlled over a wireless channel. Compared to conventional phased array systems, its advantages are adaptability, survivability and flexibility. Phase synchronization is {{a critical component of}} the WDDPA development. The common phase reference is vital to steer the beam and control the radiation pattern for the phased array system. The objective {{of this paper is to}} improve the WDDPA synchronization operation. Previous hardware and software architectures were replaced or modified to improve the accuracy and speed of the phase synchronization. A series of experiments, first for hardwired channels, then for wireless channels, were conducted successfully to verify the synchronization operation for two elements. Several problems with the circuit were diagnosed and then addressed. The overall performance of the improved <b>synchronization</b> <b>circuit</b> for the demonstration array was satisfactory, allowing phases to be synchronized within 20 Â° wirelessly. The architecture for the potential successor of the <b>synchronization</b> <b>circuit</b> is introduced.
