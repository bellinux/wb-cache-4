40|$|Virtual Organizations (VOs), {{communities}} that enable coordinated resource sharing among multiple sites, {{are becoming more}} prevalent in the high-performance computing community. In order to promote cross-site resource usability, most VOs prepare a Service Level Agreement that includes a minimum set of common resource functionality, starting with a common software stack and evolving into more complicated service and interoperability agreements. VO Service Level Agreements are often difficult to verify and maintain, however, because the sites are dynamic and autonomous. Automated verification of <b>service-level</b> <b>agreements</b> is critical: manual and user tests simply are not practical on a large scale. This paper presents the Inca test harness and reporting framework, a generic framework for the automated testing, verification, and monitoring of <b>service-level</b> <b>agreements.</b> Inca is currently {{being used by the}} TeraGrid project to verify software installations and to monitor service availability.
