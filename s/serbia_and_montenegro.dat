5|$|Both the NDH {{forces and}} Drljević had reasons for ensnaring Đurišić. The NDH forces were {{motivated}} by the mass terror committed by Đurišić on the Muslim population in Sandžak and south-eastern Bosnia.

5|$|YUG, IOP, SCG. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia (officially the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes until 1929) participated as Yugoslavia (YUG) in five Games {{before the}} Second World War. The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia also participated using the Yugoslavia (YUG) designation, for all Games between 1948–1988. Because of United Nations {{sanctions}} in Security Council Resolution 757, athletes from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (<b>Serbia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Montenegro)</b> competed as Independent Olympic Participants (IOP) at the 1992 Games. They were {{not permitted to}} compete in team sports such as basketball, handball, or water polo, and the Olympic flag was used in medal ceremonies.

5|$|Despite good {{performances}} {{in their first}} two major competitions, Croatia's qualifying campaign for Euro 2000 was less successful, as they finished third in their qualifying group behind Yugoslavia and Republic of Ireland, and thus failed to qualify.

5|$|Serbian–American {{relations}} are bilateral {{relations between the}} governments of Serbia and the United States. They were first established in 1882.

5|$|On 29 October 1918 the Croatian Parliament (Sabor) {{declared}} {{independence and}} decided to join the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which in turn entered into union with the Kingdom of Serbia on 4 December 1918 to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. The Croatian Parliament never ratified a decision to unite with <b>Serbia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Montenegro.</b> The 1921 constitution defining {{the country as a}} unitary state and abolition of Croatian Parliament and historical administrative divisions effectively ended Croatian autonomy.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Islands National Olympic Committee gained International Olympic Committee {{recognition}} in 2006 during the IOC's meeting on February 9, 2006.
