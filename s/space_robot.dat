30|$|Furthermore, the {{modified}} model-based teleoperation is verified using a hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS). Various HIL simulators for <b>space</b> <b>robots</b> were surveyed in [9]. HIL simulators for <b>space</b> <b>robots</b> {{have been developed}} mainly to simulate the capture of space targets such as satellites [10 – 12]. However most HIL simulators for <b>space</b> <b>robots</b> have used conventional serial robots to reproduce {{the movement of the}} <b>space</b> target. Serial <b>robots</b> do not generally move very quickly, and hence the response delay is relatively large. The large response delay of the motion table (the robot arm used to reproduce the movement of the space target) may cause instability in HILS [13]. Hence, this work uses a parallel-robot-based HIL simulator [14], applying delay time compensation [13] in order to validate the model-based teleoperation by simulating massive-payload manipulation.|$|R
40|$|Autonomous <b>space</b> <b>robots</b> will be {{required}} for such future missions as the construction of large space structures and repairing disabled satellites. These robots {{will need to be}} precisely controlled. However, factors such as manipulator joint/actuator friction and spacecraft attitude control thruster inaccuracies can substantially degrade control system performance. Sensor-based control algorithms can be used to mitigate the effects of actuator error, but sensors can add substantially to a space system’s weight, complexity, and cost, and reduce its reliability. Here, a method is presented to determine the sensor architecture that uses the minimum number of sensors that can simultaneously compensate for errors and disturbance in a <b>space</b> <b>robot’s</b> manipulator joint actuators, spacecraft thrusters, and reaction wheels. The placement and minimal number of sensors is determined by analytically structuring the system into “canonical chains” that consist of the manipulator links and spacecraft with force/torque sensors placed between the <b>space</b> <b>robot’s</b> spacecraft and its manipulators. These chains are combined to determine the number of sensors needed for the entire system. Examples of one- and two-manipulator <b>space</b> <b>robots</b> are studied and the results are validated by simulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{capture and}} {{recovery}} of an expensive satellite {{that has lost}} its attitude control function {{can be an important}} class of future missions for <b>space</b> <b>robots.</b> Moreover, there are tens of thousands of pieces of debris in orbit from previous missions.

40|$|Abstract Sensing {{in space}} robotic systems is {{expensive}} but necessary {{to compensate for}} imprecise actuation, disturbances, and modeling errors. It {{has been shown that}} force/torque sensors can identify actuation efforts including joint torques and reaction jet forces for multi-manipulator free-flying <b>space</b> <b>robots</b> and greatly improves system precision. This paper studies the minimum number of sensors which can identify these actuation efforts. The method uses force/torque sensors to isolate sections of the system, which are reduced to canonical elements. This allows the analysis of a small number of elements. The results of the analysis of the canonical elements are combined to determine the number of sensors needed for the original system. Configurations of one- and two-manipulator <b>space</b> <b>robots</b> are examined here and the minimal number of sensors shown. 1...|$|R
40|$|Future {{very large}} space structures, such as solar power {{stations}} and space telescopes, {{will need to}} be assembled in orbit by teams of cooperating <b>space</b> <b>robots.</b> Controlling these <b>space</b> <b>robots</b> is difficult due to the dynamic interactions forces between the robots and the large and very flexible structures.

An MIT experimental testbed designed to evaluate these algorithms is described. Then the experimental performance of one of the flexible control algorithms is presented...|$|R

40|$|As the {{dynamics}} of free-floating space robots are highly nonlinear, strongly coupled and nonholonomic constrained, the control methods for the terrestrial robot are not suitable for the free-floating <b>space</b> <b>robot.</b> At present, the control methods for the free-floating <b>space</b> <b>robot</b> are based on accurate dynamic model and need parameters identification. In this study, the dynamic model of the free-floating <b>space</b> <b>robot</b> is established and the binocular stereo vision feedback method to overcome the nonholonomic constrained characteristics that caused by the linear and angular momentum conservation theory is proposed. Then the free-floating <b>space</b> <b>robot</b> motion control method based on acceleration decomposition method is designed. Finally, the software of the free-floating <b>space</b> <b>robot</b> target capturing based on binocular stereo vision is developed and simulated. The simulation {{results show that the}} free-floating <b>space</b> <b>robot</b> based on binocular stereo vision can track a moving target in real time and ultimately can complete the target capture mission. The proposed control method provides a new effective method for the free-floating <b>space</b> <b>robot</b> capturing the target and avoiding the complex process of parameters identification for the <b>space</b> <b>robot</b> and also can effectively prevent the manipulator of the <b>space</b> <b>robot</b> in collsion with the target...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} a control of <b>space</b> <b>robot</b> for {{capturing}} moving tar-gets.

Suboptimal control, which uses piecewise optimized feedback gain by optimal tracking control method, is applied to chase the target. Also Hill’s equa-tion was applied to the relative orbital equations of motions. Based on the above formulation dynamical simulation was conducted to demonstrate the validity of our approach...|$|E
