50|$|The chain boats also {{provided}} river transportation on the canals in France, {{as well as}} on the rivers. Tunnels on the highest level of these canals were very long and electrically driven chain boats were used to tow boats through them. Due to the lack of ventilation in the tunnel systems, electrically operated chain boats continued to be used even after the introduction of <b>self-propelled</b> <b>motor</b> vessels.|$|R
50|$|In 1922, Galion {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{companies}} to develop a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>motor</b> grader. The tractor engine and transmission were located in the rear of the frame, and the operator cockpit was located near the center of the machine. Also in the 1920s, development work began on one of Galion's greatest achievements- the Galion hydraulic control. Used on both pull-type and self-propelled graders, this hydraulic system {{was one of the}} first to be applied to grader controls.|$|R
40|$|Like {{their larger}} micron-scale counterparts, Ångström-scale {{chemically}} <b>self-propelled</b> <b>motors</b> use asymmetric catalytic activity to produce self-generated concentration gradients {{that lead to}} directed motion. Unlike their micron-scale counterparts, the sizes of Ångström-scale motors are comparable to the solvent molecules in which they move, they are dominated by fluctuations, and they operate on very different time scales. These new features are studied using molecular dynamics simulations of small sphere dimer motors. We show that the ballistic regime {{is dominated by the}} thermal speed but the diffusion coefficients of these motors are orders of magnitude larger than inactive dimers. Such small motors may find applications in nano-confined systems or perhaps eventually in the cell. Comment: 6 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

2500|$|In 1906, the Virginia and Truckee Railroad {{opened a}} branch line from Carson City to Minden, Nevada. The {{profitability}} {{of the line}} led the Virginia and Truckee to start additional passenger service using <b>self-propelled</b> <b>motor</b> cars, which were less expensive to operate than a train pulled by a steam locomotive. An order was placed on October 6, 1909, with the McKeen Motor Car Company for a [...] railcar costing $22,000. Motor Car 22 was delivered to the Virginia and Truckee on May 9, 1910, and entered into regular service June 6, 1910. Declining profits forced the railroad to suspend usage of the McKeen car in 1929. It was converted into a railway post office and handler for the Railway Express Agency in 1932, and placed back into service. Motor Car 22 was retired after [...] and 35years of service on October 31, 1945.|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} this student thesis is qAnalysis of the {{machinery}} {{as a component of}} the accident system in the area of traffic operations of <b>self-propelled</b> <b>motor</b> vehicles". It deals with problems of traffic and main causes of deaths and injuries in road accidents, and proposes a possibility of their elimination. The solution is {{based on the fact that}} most of the road accidents are caused by drivers themselves who don´t pay enough attention by driving or their behaviour behind the wheel isn´t sufficient. The proposed solution is supposed to monitor the traffic in real time and in co-operation with specially-designed program installed in the electronic control unit of the vehicle it´s able to notify the driver of dangers around him. The system is also able to dynamically control the traffic in order to prevent traffic-jams, accidents on pedestrian crossings, etc. As a result of system implementation the author estimates rapid decrease in fatal road accidents, serious injuries and physical damages...|$|R
50|$|The Muscatine and Iowa City Railway was {{incorporated}} on October 25, 1915, and leased, effective January 1, 1916, the aforementioned CRI&P lines: Muscatine to Montezuma, Iowa Junction (near Riverside) to Iowa City, and Thornburg to What Cheer. It planned {{to convert from}} steam to gas-electric locomotives for freight and <b>self-propelled</b> gas-electric <b>motor</b> cars for passengers. Operation lasted less than a year, as the company was placed in receivership on July 1, and ceased operations on August 11, returning the lines to the Rock Island.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{innovations}} during Churchward's office {{included the}} introduction of <b>self-propelled</b> Steam Rail <b>Motors</b> for suburban and light branch line passenger trains. [...] From 1915 his post was renamed that of the 'Chief Mechanical Engineer'. [...] He also remodelled Swindon Works, building the 1.4 acre boiler-erecting shops and the first static locomotive-testing plant in the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|Many {{experimental}} realizations of self-propelled particles {{exhibit a}} strong tendency to aggregate and form clusters, whose dynamics are much richer {{than those of}} passive colloids. These aggregates of particles form {{for a variety of}} reasons, from chemical gradients to magnetic and ultrasonic fields. <b>Self-propelled</b> enzyme <b>motors</b> and synthetic nanomotors also exhibit clustering effects in the form of chemotaxis. Chemotaxis is a form of collective motion of biological or non-biological particles toward a fuel source or away from a threat, as observed experimentally in enzyme diffusion and also synthetic chemotaxis or phototaxis. In addition to irreversible schooling, self-propelled particles also display reversible collective motion, such as predator-prey behavior and oscillatory clustering and dispersion.|$|R
50|$|During the {{management}} of Pete Nicomedes Prado from 1986 till 1991, the PNR inaugurated the Penafrancia Express between Manila and Naga. Train formations consisted of a GE Series 900 locomotive hauling a baggage car and several passenger coaches, both aircon and economy. The airconditioned coaches had sleepers, de luxe coaches, and dining lounge coaches. Also used on Penafrancia Express trains were <b>self-propelled</b> commuter <b>motor</b> coaches from Japan, also using aircon as well as nonaircon coaches. Initially they were non-stop between Paco Station in Manila and Naga City itself, save for when the Penafrancia Express trains headed in opposite directions had to cross each other along the route in Quezon province. Later on, additional stops started getting added, mostly in the Bicol province of Camarines Sur with the train stopping in towns like Ragay, Sipocot, and Libmanan.|$|R
40|$|Collective {{motion in}} nonequilibrium steady state {{suspensions}} of <b>self-propelled</b> Janus <b>motors</b> driven by chemical reactions can arise due to interactions coming from direct intermolecular forces, hydrodynamic flow effects, or chemotactic effects mediated by chemical gradients. The {{relative importance of}} these interactions depends on the reactive characteristics of the motors, {{the way in which}} the system is maintained in a steady state, and properties of the suspension, such as the volume fraction. From simulations of a microscopic hard collision model for the interaction of fluid particles with the Janus motor we show that dynamic cluster states exist and determine the interaction mechanisms that are responsible for their formation. The relative importance of chemotactic and hydrodynamic effects is identified by considering a microscopic model in which chemotactic effects are turned off while the full hydrodynamic interactions are retained. The system is maintained in a steady state by means of a bulk reaction in which product particles are reconverted into fuel particles. The influence of the bulk reaction rate on the collective dynamics is also studied...|$|R
50|$|Joseph Armstrong's {{early death}} in 1877 {{meant that the}} next phase of motive power design was the {{responsibility}} of William Dean, his assistant and successor. Dean went on to develop express 4-4-0 types, but the familiar 4-6-0s of later years were initially introduced by the next engineer, George Jackson Churchward. He was also responsible for the introduction of <b>self-propelled</b> Steam Rail <b>Motors</b> for suburban and light branch line passenger trains. Next came Charles Collett in 1921; he standardised the many types of locomotives then in service, producing the iconic Castle and Kings. He also introduced diesel power in the form of streamlined rail cars in 1934. The final engineer was Frederick Hawksworth who took control in 1941 and produced GWR-design locomotives until after nationalisation in 1948.|$|R
5000|$|The {{frame of}} the ICF bogie is a {{fabricated}} structure made up of mild steel. Main sub-assemblies of bogie frame viz. side frames, transoms, headstocks, longitudinal forms the skeleton of the bogie frame. The sub assemblies are fabricated from flanges, webs, channels and Ribs by welding process. Various types of brackets are welded to the frame {{for the purpose of}} primary and secondary suspension arrangement, alternator suspension arrangement and brake rigging arrangement. Various brackets viz. brake hanger brackets, brake lever hanger brackets, brake cylinder fixing brackets, anchor link brackets, bolster spring suspension brackets, alternator suspension brackets, belt tensioning bracket/s, axle box guides, suspension straps are welded on the bogie frames. It involves 40 meters (app.) of welding in a single conventional bogie frame. Based on load carrying capacity per axle, the conventional bogie frames are grouped into two types. They are 13 ton bogie frame and 16 ton bogie frame. 13 ton bogie frames are being used in the bogies of all non-AC mainline coaches and 16 ton bogie frames are being used in bogies of all AC coaches, power cars and diesel multiple unit trailer coaches. EMU Motor Coach type bogie frames, a different design of bogie frame is being used in all coaches of Electric Multiple Units (EMU) and all <b>self-propelled</b> coaches (<b>motor</b> coaches ...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we for {{the first}} time have {{proposed}} and fabricated a <b>self-propelled</b> Janus foam <b>motor</b> for on-the-fly oil absorption on water by simply loading camphor/stearic acid (SA) mixture as fuels into one end of the SA-modified polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) foam. The as-fabricated Janus foam motors show an efficient Marangoni effect-based self-propulsion on water for a long lifetime due to the effective inhibition of the rapid release of camphor by the hydrophobic SA in the fuel mixture. Furthermore, they can automatically search, capture, and absorb oil droplets on the fly, and then be spontaneously self-assembled after oil absorption due to the self-propulsion of the motors as well as the attractive capillary interactions between the motors and oil droplets. This facilitates the subsequent collection of the motors from water after the treatment. Since the as-developed Janus foam motors can effectively integrate intriguing behaviors of the self-propulsion, efficient oil capture, and spontaneous self-assembly, they hold great promise for practical applications in water treatment...|$|R
50|$|People {{also use}} wagons for small, outdoor projects. Companies such as Northern Tool, Lowe's, and Tractor Supply Company make wagons {{specifically}} for outdoor work. Usually they are painted {{a different color}} than red and are made of metal. They are also usually larger and more expensive. Wagons can be useful for moving dirt, wood chips, mulch, or gravel. They {{can also be used}} in gardening for moving plants. Nursery wagons are available just for professional gardening. Nursery wagons let dirt and water go through the bottom and are good for plants and pots in a greenhouse. They can also be used for moving camping gear or boxes. Some utility wagons are <b>self-propelled</b> by small <b>motors</b> so that the user can handle heavier loads on rough, uneven terrain. These wagons are often equipped with a tilting cargo bed which allows the user to dump their cargo more easily, making them suitable for small farms. Some companies, such as Speedway Express, make huge 8-wheeled wagons that are made of wood, usually handmade by the Amish.|$|R
40|$|Portable {{biosensor}} {{systems would}} benefit from reduced dependency on external power supplies {{as well as from}} further miniaturization and increased detection rate. Systems built around <b>self-propelled</b> biological molecular <b>motors</b> and cytoskeletal filaments hold significant promise in these regards as they are built from nanoscale components that enable nanoseparation independent of fluidic pumping. Previously reported microtubule-kinesin based devices are slow, however, compared to several existing biosensor systems. Here we demonstrate that this speed limitation can be overcome by using the faster actomyosin motor system. Moreover, due to lower flexural rigidity of the actin filaments, smaller features can be achieved compared to microtubule-based systems, enabling further miniaturization. Using a device designed through optimization by Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate extensive myosin driven enrichment of actin filaments on a detector area of less than 10 μm(2), with a concentration half-time of approximately 40 s. We also show accumulation of model analyte (streptavidin at nanomolar concentration in nanoliter effective volume) detecting increased fluorescence intensity within seconds after initiation of motor-driven transportation from capture regions. We discuss further optimizations of the system and incorporation into a complete biosensing workflow...|$|R
40|$|The coxal leg-stump of a {{stick insect}} was rotated about the coxa-thorax joint, {{by means of}} a pen-motor, while the animal walked on a <b>self-propelled</b> double treadwheel. <b>Motor</b> {{activity}} in the retractor muscles of the legs was recorded for standing and walking animals with the stump of either the middle or hind leg moved forward and backward in a trajectory similar to that used in a walking step. In a standing animal the movement of either leg evokes a weak resistance reflex. If the animal walks with the middle leg-stump held still, then short and weak motor bursts are generated with the periodicity of the walking legs. Front and hind legs alternate in a manner typical of the middle leg amputee and the retractor muscle of the amputated leg is most active during the power stroke of the leg behind. When a middle leg-stump is moved at a different frequency from that of the walking legs, the motor output to the retractor is strongly modulated and depends on the relative timing of the stump and the walking legs. Rearward movement of the hind leg-stump, during walking, is always accompanied by strong motor output in the retractor muscle. In addition, forward movement in this leg-stump produces a resistance reflex similar to that produced in the standing animal...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{effects of}} the {{friction}} and truncation on the dynamics of a double-cone gravitational <b>motor,</b> <b>self-propelled</b> on a straight V-shaped horizontal rail, are evaluated. Such mechanism has a variable radius of contact, and, on one hand, it {{is similar to a}} pulley mechanism that changes the potential energy into the kinetic energy of rotation, but on the other hand, it is similar to a pendulum mechanism that converts the potential energy of the suspended body into the kinetic energy of translation along a circular path. Movies of the self- propelled double-cones, made of S 45 C carbon steel and wood, along rails made of aluminum alloy, were shot for various opening angles of the rails. Kinematical features of the double-cones were estimated through the slow-motion processing of the recorded movies. Then, a kinematical model is derived under assumption that the distance traveled by the contact points on the rectilinear rails is identical with the distance traveled by the contact points on the truncated conical surface. Additionally, a dynamic model, for this particular contact problem, was proposed and validated against the experimental results. Based on such model, the traction force and the traction torque acting on the double-cone are identified. One proved that the rolling traction force is always smaller than the sliding friction force; i. e., the double-cone is rolling without slipping. Results obtained in this work can be used to achieve the proper design of such gravitational motor...|$|R
