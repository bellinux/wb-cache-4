We first use the new floating-point texture map formats to find matrix radiosity solutions for light transport in a di#use environment, and use this example to investigate the di#erences between GPU and CPU performance on matrix operations. We then examine multiple-scattering subsurface light transport, which can be modeled to resemble a single radiosity gathering step. We use a multiresolution meshed atlas to organize a hierarchy of precomputed <b>subsurface</b> <b>links,</b> and devise a three-pass GPU algorithm to render in real time the subsurface-scattered illumination of an object, with dynamic lighting and viewing...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Chlorinated {{hydrocarbons}} (CHCs) {{are one of}} {{the pollutant}} groups most com-monly found in hazardous waste sites. Understanding the transport and fate of these compounds in the vadose zone is crucial to identifying pollution sources, assessing the threat to groundwater, and evaluating the need and adequacy of cleanup. CHCs exist in various physical phases in the <b>subsurface,</b> <b>linked</b> by interphasal processes. These, combined with unsaturated water flow in the vadose zone, which is complicated by the multifluid (air and water) situation, geologic hetero-geneity, and a highly site-specific preferential flow pattern, create a possibly four-fluid flow condition, with interactions among different phases of CHCs and between chemicals and geologic materials. Superimposed on these are various biotic and abiotic transformations. Integration of these processes is being attempted by mathematical modeling; however, natural heterogeneity and site-specific factors render these efforts partially successful at best. Regulators are faced with considerable uncertainties and cannot expect simple solutions with the current level of understanding of subsurface processes.

40|$|On February 22, 2011, a {{magnitude}} Mw 6. 2 earthquake affected the Canterbury region, New Zealand, resulting in many fatalities. Liquefaction occurred across many areas, {{visible on the}} surface as ‘‘sand volcanoes’’, blisters and subsidence, causing significant damage to buildings, land and infrastructure. Liquefaction occurred {{at a number of}} sites across the Christchurch Boys High School sports grounds; one area in particular contained a piston ground failure and an adjacent silt volcano. Here, as part of a class project, we apply near-surface geophysics to image these two liquefaction features and determine whether they share a subsurface connection. Hand auger results enable correlation of the geophysical responses with the subsurface stratigraphy. The survey results suggest that there is a <b>subsurface</b> <b>link,</b> likely via a paleo-stream channel. The anomalous responses of the horizontal loop electromagnetic survey and electrical resistivity imaging highlight the disruption of the subsurface electrical properties beneath and between the two liquefaction features. The vertical magnetic gradient may also show a subtle anomalous response in this area, however the results are inconclusive. The ground penetrating radar survey shows disruption of the subsurface stratigraphy beneath the liquefaction features, in particular sediment mounding beneath the silt ejection (‘‘silt volcano’’) and stratigraphic disruption beneath the piston failure. The results indicate how near-surface geophysics allow the characteristics of liquefaction in the subsurface to be better understood, which could aid remediation work following liquefaction-induced land damage and guide interpretation of geophysical surveys of paleoliquefaction features...|$|R

Despite considerable investment, some UK bathing waters fail to comply with mandatory stan-dards {{as defined by the}} EU Bathing Water Directive (76 / 160 /EEC). Continued non-compliance has been associated with diffuse sources of faecal indicator organism (FIO) contamination, in particular those deriving from agricultural land. This paper examines concentrations of FIOs in surface, subsurface and instream water samples at field sites considered to pose a high potential risk of FIO contamination. Quality of samples was compared with FIO standards for bathing water compliance in the UK. FIO concentrations exceeding mandatory and guideline standards were recorded frequently at all sites. In freely draining soils, FIO mobiliz-ation by rainfall was predominantly via subsurface flow, with occasional surface water flow linked to intensive rainfall events. In slowly permeable soils, surface mobilization of FIOs predominated, with the occurrence of limited <b>subsurface</b> samples <b>linked</b> to seasonal desiccation cracking within the soil, and to intense rainfall events. Watercourse FIO concentrations were significantly increased as the stream passed-by fields with freely draining soils. The data imply a generally higher risk of FIO transfer from freely draining soils and occasional increased risk from less permeable soils due to temporal changes in soil structure and rainfall intensity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHigh {{resolution}} hydrographic {{observations of}} temperature and salinity {{are used to}} analyse the subsurface circulation {{along the coast of}} North Brazil, off the Amazon mouth, between 2 °S and 6 °N. Observations are presented from four cruises carried out in different periods of the year (March-May 1995, May-June 1999, July-August 2001 and October-November 1997). Numerical model outputs complement the results of the shipboard measurements, and are used to complete the descriptions of mesoscale circulation. The Salinity Maximum Waters are here analyzed, principally in order to describe the penetration of waters originating in the Southern Hemisphere toward the Northern Hemisphere through the North Brazil Current (NBC) /North Brazil Undercurrent (NBUC). Our results show that, if the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) is fed by Northern Atlantic Waters, this contribution may only occur in the ocean interior, east of the western boundary around 100 m depth. Modeling results indicate a southward penetration of the Western Boundary Undercurrent (WBUC) below the thermocline, along the North Brazilian coast into the EUC or the North Equatorial Undercurrent (NEUC) (around 48 °W- 3 °N). The WBUC in the region does not flow more south than 3 °N. The northern waters are diverted eastward either by the NBC retroflection or by the northern edge of the associated clockwise rings. The existence of subsurface mesoscale rings associated to the NBC retroflection is evidenced, without any signature in the surface layer, so confirming earlier numerical model outputs. These <b>subsurface</b> anticyclones, <b>linked</b> to the NBC/NBUC retroflection into the North Equatorial Undercurrent and the EUC, contribute to the transport of South Atlantic high salinity water into the Northern Hemisphere...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{vertically}} averaged free-surface and <b>subsurface</b> flows are <b>linked</b> and solved {{simultaneously in}} a two-dimensional numerical model for predicting flood flows. A TVD-MacCormack scheme {{is used to}} solve the shallow water equations for free surface flows, while the standard MacCormack scheme is employed to solve the transient Boussinesq equations for unconfined groundwater flows. The dynamic linking of the surface/subsurface models enables the interactions between the surface water flow and the neighbouring groundwater flow in the horizontal plane to be studied. The developed model is firstly verified against the analytical solutions and experimental measurements. The model is then used to investigate the influence of buildings on flood flows, where the buildings are modelled as porous media. This approach of modelling buildings is compared with two other commonly used methods: the first being to represent the buildings by solid blocks, {{and the second is}} to include the buildings by increasing the local roughness. It has been found that the combined surface/subsurface model provides a high degree of flexibility in representing the buildings in a flood flow simulation...|$|R
30|$|The primary {{goals of}} this paper include the {{constraint}} of subsurface VLP source location/mechanism and to establish the range of plausible links to the surface eruption activity. To these ends, we first examined the timing of VLP occurrence and its relationship with surface eruptive activity. Next, we determine its location using a waveform semblance approach, and examine the source properties via a waveform inversion. Finally, we modeled the lag-time predicted from TOUGH 2 models (Pruess 1991) for a gas pulse propagating from the known VLP source region to the surface. The modeling allowed us to examine two plausible end-member eruption triggers, namely gas advection (mass transfer) from depth to the surface, or stress transfer from either a static stress pulse or via the dynamic stresses from elastic waves. Observations suggest that the April 2016 eruptions {{may be related to}} both mechanisms. While acknowledging the difficulty in rigorously <b>linking</b> <b>subsurface</b> earthquake activity to any surface observation, the methods outlined here provide a framework for identification and interpretation of pre-eruption subsurface activity, and how they relate to subsequent eruptions. This information can inform unrest and eruption monitoring in volcanic environments.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{reported here}} {{is part of}} a larger project that is coupling a suite of environmental models to simulate the hydrologic cycle within river basins (Bossert et al., 1999). These models include the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS), which provides meteorological variables and precipitation to the Simulator for Processes of Landscapes, Surface/Subsurface Hydrology (SPLASH). SPLASH partitions precipitation into evaporation, transpiration, soil water storage, surface runoff, and subsurface recharge. The runoff is collected within a simple river channel model and the Finite element Heat and Mass (FEHM) <b>subsurface</b> model is <b>linked</b> to the land surface and river flow model components to simulate saturated and unsaturated flow and changes in aquifer levels. The goal is to produce a fully interactive system of atmospheric, surface hydrology, river and groundwater models to allow water and energy feedbacks throughout the system. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the precipitation fields predicted by the RAMS model at different times during the 1992 [...] 1993 water year in the Rio Grande basin. The evaluation includes comparing the model predictions to the observed precipitation as reported by Cooperative Summary of the Day and SNOTEL reporting stations...|$|R

There was a significant latitudinal trend consisting in a general decrease in DOC, DIC, SO 4, and major cation (Ca, Mg, Na, K) concentration northward, reflecting the interplay between groundwater feeding (detectable mostly in the permafrost-free zone, south of 60 ° N) and surface flux (in the permafrost-bearing zone). The northward decrease in concentration of inorganic components was strongly pronounced both in winter and spring, whereas for DOC, the trend of concentration decrease with latitude was absent in winter, and less pronounced in spring flood than in summer baseflow. The most significant decrease in K concentration from the southern ( 10 000 km 2. Environmental factors are ranked by their increasing effect on DOC, DIC, δ 13 C DIC, and major elements in western Siberian rivers as follows: watershed area < season < latitude. Because the degree of the groundwater feeding is different between large and small rivers, we hypothesize that, in addition to groundwater feeding of the river, {{there was a significant}} role of surface and shallow <b>subsurface</b> flow <b>linked</b> to plant litter degradation and peat leaching. We suggest that plant-litter- and topsoil-derived DOC adsorbs on clay mineral horizons in the southern, permafrost-free and discontinuous/sporadic permafrost zone but lacks the interaction with minerals in the continuous permafrost zone. It can be anticipated that, under climate warming in western Siberia, the maximal change will occur in small (2 watershed) rivers DOC, DIC and ionic composition and this change will be mostly pronounced in summer...|$|R

40|$|The Arctic Ocean (AO) is an {{oligotrophic}} {{system with}} a pronounced subsurface Chl-a maximum dominating productivity over {{the majority of the}} basin. Strong haline stratification of the AO and substantial ice cover suppress vertical mixing and restrict the vertical supply of nutrients to the photic zone. In such a vertically stratified oligotrophic system, the horizontal supply of nutrients by advection {{plays an important role in}} sustaining primary production. In this paper we attempt to characterise the role of nutrient advection in the maintenance of the subsurface Chl-a maximum, using time scales to determine the connectivity between the photic zone of the deep Arctic Ocean, nutrient-rich Pacific and Atlantic inflow waters, and bottom waters of the wide continental shelves of the AO. Our study uses output from a general circulation model, NEMO, coupled to a model of ocean biogeochemistry, MEDUSA. A Lagrangian particle tracking approach is used to back-track water from where it forms subsurface Chl-a maxima to the points of entry into the AO and to analyse nutrient transformation along the route. Our experiments show that advective timescales <b>linking</b> <b>subsurface</b> layers of the central AO with the nutrient rich Pacific and Atlantic waters do not exceed 15 - 20 ?years, and that the advective supply of shelf nutrients to the deep AO occurs on the timescale of about 5 ?years.

40|$|Highlights • Holocene sea {{subsurface}} temperatures after Husum & Hald (2012) estimated from planktic foraminifer fauna in E Fram Strait. • Biomarkers and IP 25 -derived indices (including DIP 25) indicate {{surface water}} variability. • Delayed onset of early Holocene conditions in subsurface (∼ 10. 6 ka) compared to surface (∼ 11. 7 ka) water conditions. • Warm Atlantic layer likely occupied uppermost 200 m in eastern Fram Strait between 10 and 9 ka. • Diverging late Holocene trends in surface and <b>subsurface</b> conditions <b>linked</b> to presence of strong pycnocline/stratification. Abstract Two high-resolution sediment cores from eastern Fram Strait {{have been investigated}} for sea subsurface and surface temperature variability during the Holocene (the past ca 12, 000 years). The transfer function developed by Husum and Hald (2012) {{has been applied to}} sediment cores in order to reconstruct fluctuations of sea subsurface temperatures throughout the period. Additional biomarker and foraminiferal proxy data are used to elucidate variability between surface and subsurface water mass conditions, and to conclude on the Holocene climate and oceanographic variability on the West Spitsbergen continental margin. Results consistently reveal warm sea surface to subsurface temperatures of up to 6 °C until ca 5 cal ka BP, with maximum seawater temperatures around 10 cal ka BP, likely related to maximum July insolation occurring at that time. Maximum Atlantic Water (AW) advection occurred at surface and subsurface between 10. 6 and 8. 5 cal ka BP based on both foraminiferal and dinocyst temperature reconstructions. Probably, a less-stratified, ice-free, nutrient-rich surface ocean with strong AW advection prevailed in the eastern Fram Strait between 10 and 9 cal ka BP. Weakened AW contribution is found after ca 5 cal ka BP when subsurface temperatures strongly decrease with minimum values between ca 4 and 3 cal ka BP. Cold late Holocene conditions are furthermore supported by high planktic foraminifer shell fragmentation and high δ 18 O values of the subpolar planktic foraminifer species Turborotalita quinqueloba. While IP 25 -associated indices as well as dinocyst data suggest a sustained cooling due to a decrease in early summer insolation and consequently sea-ice increase since about 7 cal ka BP in surface waters, planktic foraminiferal data including stable isotopes indicate a slight return of stronger subsurface AW influx since ca 3 cal ka BP. The observed decoupling of surface and subsurface waters during the later Holocene is most likely attributed to a strong pycnocline layer separating cold sea-ice fed surface waters from enhanced subsurface AW advection. This may be related to changes in North Atlantic subpolar versus subtropical gyre activity...|$|R
40|$|A {{common factor}} in {{landslide}} activation (or reactivation) is subsurface moisture and associated pore pressure variations linked to rainfall. Monitoring of these subsurface hydrogeological processes {{is necessary to}} improve our understanding of water-induced landslide activation. Geophysical approaches, electrical methods in particular, are being increasingly applied to landslide monitoring because they provide non-invasive spatial information in heterogeneous subsurface environments that {{can be difficult to}} characterise using surface observations or intrusive sampling alone. Electrical techniques are sensitive to changing subsurface moisture conditions, and have proven to be a useful tool for investigating the hydrogeology of natural and engineered slopes. The objectives of this investigation were to further develop electrical resistance monitoring for slope stability assessment, and to validate the approach at an intermittently-active UK landslide system to advance the understanding of complex landslide activation mechanisms. A long-term transfer resistance dataset was collected from a grid of electrodes to allow spatial monitoring of the landslide. These data were interpreted using a synthesis of rainfall, temperature, GPS and piezometric records. The resistance data were corrected for seasonal temperature variations and electrode movements were monitored, as these processes were shown to mask moisture related changes. Results reveal that resistance monitoring is sensitive to soil moisture accumulation, including changes in piezometric levels, and can be used to study the principal activation mechanism of slow-moving shallow earthflows. Spatial monitoring using resistance maps was shown to be particularly valuable as it revealed the evolution of subsurface moisture distribution, in the lead up to landslide activation. Key benefits of this approach are that it provides a simple, rapid and non-invasive means of spatially monitoring <b>subsurface</b> moisture dynamics <b>linked</b> to landslide activation at high-temporal resolution. Crucially, it provides a means of monitoring subsurface hydraulic changes in the build-up to slope failure, thereby contributing to early warning of landslide events...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the theory, concepts and applications of groundwater flow systems, has had a tremendous influence on hydrogeologists' understanding of spatial and three dimensional groundwater flow relationships. The recognition of how groundwater connects locations across the subsurface, horizontally and vertically over longer and shorter distances, grew steadily over several hundreds of years but had a clear culmination with the landmark papers of Joe Tóth. Tóth also realised and indicated the importance of groundwater flow systems for different physical, chemical, geomechanical and ecological processes at the landsurface. As hydrogeologists are focused on <b>subsurface</b> phenomena, this <b>link</b> between groundwater flow systems and the landsurface has often been neglected or simplified {{as a result of}} our mostly mono-disciplinary approaches and research capacities. Increasing attention for interdisciplinarity, as e. g. in the research on groundwater-surface water interaction andecohydrology, offers new opportunities to use groundwater flow systems for improving our understanding of phenomena like occurrence of vegetation and their dependence on groundwater, but also how the vegetation influences the groundwater system. Connecting groundwater and landsurface processes, especially at groundwater dependent wetlands, might therefore be an eye-opener for both hydrogeologists and ecologists. In this presentation we will review from where we came with respect to groundwater systems and the groundwater dependent wetlands as well as what are open issues in research and how hydrogeologists can contribute to the relatively new field of ecohydrology. We will present examples, groundwater and vegetation modelling methodologies, results and lessons learnt from case studies in Belgium and Australia in which vegetation and groundwater flow and systems analysis go hand in hand.

A transgressive phase resulted first in the deposition of lacustrine pro-delta mudstones towards the basin centre, followed by the deposition of a more extensive thin marine mudstone which formed the base of the middle Triassic over most of the U.

Each started with deposition of the cyclic, hypersaline-marine halites (the Main and Upper RÃ¶t Halites), followed by sabkhas, then playa mudflat/lagoonal deposits. At the start of the Muschelkalk deposition, restricted marine conditions were established in the Southern North Sea area. These were followed by a further regressive sequence of hypersaline-marine halites (the Muschelkalk Halite), sabkhas, and finally playa mudstones. The establishment of continental sedimentation across the whole of the Germanic Basin marked the end of the middle Triassic. The cyclicity within the Germanic Basin correlates with the published coastal onlap charts, indicating its origin is eustatic fluctuations in Tethys. </p...|$|R
