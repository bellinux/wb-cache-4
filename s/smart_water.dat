For this, the agent-based approach is a modelling solution often proposed.

40|$|Extreme uneven {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} distributions of rainfall pose the risk of water shortage to the industries in Taiwan, particularly during dry seasons, which may be worsen under climate change. This study aims to develop adaptation actions for an industrial company {{to reduce the risk}} of droughts. The Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC) in Chuoshui River watershed is selected as a study case and an integrated risk assessment tool of water resources TaiWAP is used. The water shortage of FPC is mainly in the dry seasons because the water rights of public and agricultural uses are prioritized over industrial use.

40|$|Foreword. Climate {{change is}} bad news for water {{resources}} – and thus for human development, societies, economies, the environment, and local and global security. The increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods serves as a reminder of the effects climate change can have on {{the quantity and quality of}} global water reserves, and thus on various other aspects of life. Even though the effects differ from region to region, this is a global challenge with far-reaching consequences to which Europe is not immune. As the world leaders gather in Paris in December 2015 to discuss a new international climate deal, it is worth to remind politicians, businesses and citizens of the water challenge and its wider implications, which already affect us today – and which will only get worse with climate change. However, water-related risks resulting from climate change are not a fatality and damage control doesn’t have to be the only mantra. Placing the water challenge at the centre of political and security dialogues, development strategies and climate mitigation and adaptation measures, and implementing <b>smarter</b> <b>water</b> management, could also bring great economic, environmental and social benefits, in and outside the European Union. It would also contribute to global security. Water matters – now more than ever. This is also what this publication demonstrates. Building on the European Policy Centre’s, two-year “Blue Gold” project, this publication shows the rationale for action, how the EU could use its existing internal and external policy instruments to tackle the water challenge with its various dimensions and the benefits of action...|$|R
