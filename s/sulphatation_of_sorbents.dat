The present study addresses the reactivation of the sulphur capture ability of fluidized bed (FB) spent sorbent particles by either water or steam hydration. Sorbent particles are subjected to different treatments including calcination, sulphation, hydration by either water or steam, dehydration and resulphation. Processing <b>of</b> <b>sorbents</b> is accomplished by the combined use of a bench scale (40 mm ID) fluidized bed reactor (calcination, sulphation, steam hydration, dehydration and resulphation) and of a thermostated water hydrator (water hydration).

The operating parameters evaluated included: (1) different sorbents (kaolinite, limestone, aluminum oxide, and water); (2) the feed waste contained organic chloride (PVC); (3) the feed waste contained inorganic chloride (NaCl); (4) the feed waste contained sulfate (Na 2 SO 4); (5) comparing the controlling efficiency <b>of</b> <b>sorbents</b> used in the combustion chamber and injected in the flue of an incineration system. Experimental results indicated that the control efficiency <b>of</b> the four <b>sorbents</b> for heavy metals under various feed waste composition follows the sequence of limestone > water > kaolinite > aluminum or;ide. The best sorbent for the four heavy metals is limestone, especially as the feed waste contained organic chloride PVC, because limestone slurry provides a lot of calcium and alkali to react with the metal chlorides and acid gas. The presence of inorganic chloride NaCl and sulfate Na 2 SO 4 in the feed waste is helpful to increase the capture efficiency <b>of</b> the <b>sorbents</b> for heavy metals.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 132 - 137. An overall {{process model}} is {{presented}} for {{the capture of}} sulphur dioxide by calcareous sorbents in a fluidised bed combustor for a feed of arbitrary size distribution. The description <b>of</b> <b>sorbent</b> sulphation kinetics, particle attrition and elutriation effects incorporated in this model is supported by experimental data {{for a wide range}} <b>of</b> South African <b>sorbents.</b> The sulphation <b>of</b> <b>sorbent</b> particles is described by a simple, two-parameter, kinetic model. No loss in physical relevance is incurred when the decrease in reaction rate with time is given by a negative exponential term. Both sulphation rate and capacity are shown to be functions <b>of</b> <b>sorbent</b> type. The sulphation propensity of the 16 South African samples is correlated against their geologic description. Sorbent properties such as porosity, crystallinity and topography, which affect sulphation capacity directly, are functions of geologic age. It is possible to make a first order assessment <b>of</b> <b>sorbent</b> potential simply from this geologic data. Sorbent attrition, caused by the continuous movement of particles within the combustor, is greatest for deep beds of soft friable material. Most of the attrition takes place in the distributor region where jetting action is important. The attrition model reflects an explicit dependence on fluidising velocity, bed depth, particle diameter, topography and structural strength. Measured values of attrition rate decrease with time to a steady state value, which, under normal FBC operating conditions, is attained after a time in the bed of 6 - 10 hours. The elutriation model considers the effect of fines, generated by attrition, on the carry-over of coarse particles from the bed. The overall process model confirms that choice of sulphation kinetics exerts the greatest influence on attainable sulphur capture,. although bed fluid dynamics, sorbent attrition and feed size distribution all play a role. The model is substantiated by extensive data from the performance <b>of</b> three dissimilar <b>sorbents</b> in a 10 MWth FBC.

The principles <b>of</b> <b>sorbent</b> air cleaning are introduced, criteria are suggested for sorbent systems that can counteract indoor VOC concentration increases from reduced ventilation, major findings from research on sorbent performance for this application are summarized, and related priority research needs are identified. Major conclusions include: sorbent systems can remove {{a broad range of}} VOCs with moderate to high efficiency, sorbent technologies perform effectively when challenged with VOCs at the low concentrations present indoors, and there is a large uncertainty about the lifetime and associated costs <b>of</b> <b>sorbent</b> air cleaning systems when used in commercial buildings for indoor VOC control. Suggested priority research includes: experiments to determine sorbent system VOC removal efficiencies and lifetimes considering the broad range and low concentration of VOCs indoors; evaluations of in-situ regeneration of sorbents; and an updated analysis of the cost <b>of</b> <b>sorbent</b> air cleaning relative to the cost of ventilation...|$|R
