5|$|Syd Cain {{returned}} as art director and was involved searching for locations with Guy Hamilton in March 1972. Principal photography began on 13 October 1972 in the Irish Bayou in Louisiana for a boat chase scene. On 29 November production moved to Jamaica, which doubled for the fictional island San Monique, {{the home of}} antagonist Kananga. In December, production was divided between interiors in Pinewood Studios, while a <b>separate</b> <b>unit</b> also shot in Harlem.|$|E
5|$|Though its lineage {{dates back}} to 1957, the unit was not {{designated}} as a <b>separate</b> <b>unit</b> until 2005. The 3rd Sustainment Brigade has served three tours in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, its first tour being the initial invasion and securing of the country, followed by a second tour of duty as logistics support for units around Baghdad, and finally as the multinational division supply lines in the northern division of the country.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{released}} Croats apparently {{succeeded in}} travelling to the Slovene Littoral {{in the closing}} days of the war. They were then organised as a <b>separate</b> <b>unit</b> of the largely illusory remnant of the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia {{under the command of}} General Matija Parac, which was formally part of General Draža Mihailović's Chetniks. The unit was under the direct command of General Miodrag Damjanović. Later the unit retreated to British-occupied northern Italy.|$|E

5|$|The brigade {{received}} its shoulder sleeve insignia on 19 March 2007 and its distinctive unit insignia on 8 November 2007. The insignia alludes heavily to the unit's {{history with the}} 82d Airborne Division. In 2015 the brigade ceased being a <b>separate</b> <b>unit</b> and {{became part of the}} 82d Airborne Division. As a division unit, its personnel adopted the division's shoulder sleeve insignia and the maroon beret with a brigade-specific flash; however, most of the brigade's personnel are not on jump status and only wear the maroon beret and shoulder sleeve insignia because these are unit uniform items.|$|E
5|$|The studio {{released}} Meet the Robinsons in 2007, {{its second}} all-CGI film, earning $169.3 million worldwide. That same year, DisneyToon Studios was also restructured {{and began to}} operate as a <b>separate</b> <b>unit</b> under Lasseter and Catmull's control. Lasseter's direct intervention with the studio's next film, American Dog, resulted in the departure of director Chris Sanders, {{who went on to}} become a director at DreamWorks Animation. The film was retooled by new directors Byron Howard and Chris Williams as Bolt, which was released in 2008 and had the best critical reception of any Disney animated feature since Lilo & Stitch, and became a moderate financial success.|$|E
5|$|To {{mark the}} 40th anniversary of Naim Audio and the 30th {{birthday}} {{of the original}} NAIT, Naim unveiled a new 3-product range under the NAIT brand: the NAIT 5si, NAIT XS 2 and SUPERNAIT 2. The range has seen a general uprating of the transformer compared with the versions they replaced, allowing for better power delivery. The manufacturer claims use of better components in critical areas and new circuitry. All three models have built-in headphone amplifiers. The digital–analogue converter has been removed as being available either as a <b>separate</b> <b>unit,</b> {{or as part of}} the Uniti.|$|E

5|$|Gaza {{was granted}} to Herod the Great by Roman emperor Augustus in 30 BCE, where it formed a <b>separate</b> <b>unit</b> within his kingdom; and Cosgabar, the {{governor}} of Idumea, {{was in charge of}} the city's affairs. On the division of Herod's kingdom, it was placed under the proconsul of Syria. After Herod's death in 4 BCE, Augustus annexed it to the Province of Syria. In 66 CE, Gaza was burned down by Jews during their rebellion against the Romans. However, it remained an important city; even more so after the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus the following year. Titus passed through Gaza on his march toward to Jerusalem, and again in his return. The establishment of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea restored trade links with Petra and Aila.|$|E
5|$|Together {{these two}} units {{remained}} linked until 4 September 1939 when, {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Colonel William Jeater, the 2nd Battalion was once again raised as a <b>separate</b> <b>unit</b> {{as part of an effort}} by the Australian government to hastily expand the Militia following the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war, although mobilised and assigned to the 1st Brigade, the battalion did not see active service overseas and was instead used as a garrison force in Australia until 2 December 1943 when it was merged once again with the 41st Battalion, forming the 41st/2nd Battalion. They remained linked until 17 December 1945, when they were disbanded as part of the demobilisation process.|$|E
5|$|The Macedonian army {{continued}} to evolve under the Antigonid dynasty. It is uncertain {{how many men}} were appointed as somatophylakes, which numbered eight men {{at the end of}} Alexander the Great's reign, while the hypaspistai seem to have morphed into assistants of the somatophylakes rather than a <b>separate</b> <b>unit</b> in their own right. At the Battle of Cynoscephalae in 197 BC, the Macedonians commanded some 16,000 phalanx pikemen. Alexander the Great's 'royal squadron' of companion cavalry were similarly numbered to the 800 cavalrymen of the 'sacred squadron' (Latin: sacra ala; Greek: hiera ile) commanded by Philip V of Macedon during the Social War of 219 BC. Due to the Roman historian Livy's accounts of the battles of Callinicus in 171 BC and Pydna in 168 BC, it is known that the Macedonian cavalry were also divided into groups with similarly named officers as had existed in Alexander's day. The regular Macedonian cavalry numbered 3,000 at Callinicus, which was separate from the 'sacred squadron' and 'royal cavalry'. Thanks to contemporary inscriptions from Amphipolis and Greia dated 218 and 181 respectively, historians have been able to partially piece together the organization of the Antigonid army under Philip V, such as its command by tetrarchai officers assisted by grammateis (i.e. secretaries or clerks).|$|E

5|$|Early morning 11 March, the LSSAH {{launched}} a two-prong attack into northern Kharkov. The 2nd Panzergrenadier Regiment, advancing from the Northwest, split up into two columns advancing towards northern Kharkov {{on either side}} of the Belgorod-Kharkov railroad. The 2nd Battalion, on the right side of the railroad, attacked the city's Severnyi Post district, meeting heavy resistance and advancing only to the Severenyi railway yard by the end of the day. On the opposite side of the railroad, the 1st Battalion struck at the district of Alexeyevka, meeting a T-34-led Soviet counterattack which drove part of the 1st Battalion back out of the city. Only with aerial and artillery support, coming from Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers and StuG assault guns, were the German infantry able to battle their way into the city. A flanking attack from the rear finally allowed the German forces to achieve a foothold in that area of the city. Simultaneously, the 1st SS Panzergrenadier Regiment, with armor attached from a <b>separate</b> <b>unit,</b> attacked down the main road from Belgorod, fighting an immediate counterattack produced over the Kharkov's airport, coming on their left flank. Fighting their way past Soviet T-34s, this German contingent was able to lodge itself into Kharkov's northern suburbs. From the northeast, another contingent of German infantry, armor and self-propelled guns attempted to take control of the road exits to the cities of Rogan and Chuhuiv. This attack penetrated deeper into Kharkov, but low on fuel the armor was forced to entrench itself and turn to the defensive.|$|E
