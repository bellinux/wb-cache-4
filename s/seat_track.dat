The report outlined a number of options, including spending $7 million to $9 million to replace the grandstand, spending another $35 million to build a larger arena, and paying $12.6 million to demolish all existing horse barns and service facilities and build a 2,000-to-3,000 <b>seat</b> <b>track</b> just for horse racing.|$|E

50|$|Track One A.B. {{formed as}} a rock band in the late 1980s with Chris Celauro on vocals and guitar, Dean Midulla on bass, and Joe Fallacara on drums. The trio were former Hauppauge High School schoolmates. They {{recorded}} various demos before Fallacara left {{and was replaced by}} another Hauppauge alumnus Rich Ramirez, who Celauro had played with in high school. The band released a few self-funded EPs which resulted in some college radio airplay and gigs with the likes of The Spin Doctors, which eventually attracted the attention of Live manager Steve Smith and MCA Records and Island Records, but they wound up signing with indie label Royalty Records. During this time, Christian Carpenter had joined to add extra percussion and vocals only to have Ramirez abruptly leave on the dawn of the recording session for their first full-length album. This put Fallacara back on the drum <b>seat.</b> <b>Track</b> One A.B. quickly recorded a version of Ticket To Ride for the 1995s album Beatlejuice: A Big Apple Tribute to the Beatles.|$|E

40|$|Dynamic {{testing of}} {{aircraft}} seats has been incorporated {{to enhance the}} survivability of aircraft mishaps for over 10 years. This standard may be introduced into aircraft with certification basis prior to this introduction if seat loads can {{be limited to the}} structural capabilities of the <b>seat</b> <b>track.</b> Since the earlier seat tracks typically had lower load requirements they may not be capable of bearing a dynamic seat test with current seat designs. An attempt to establish the performance objects of energy absorbing features will be investigated. Modeling dynamic events with MADYMO software has been proven to be efficient and accurate in many aerospace and automotive applications. Using this tool, a model was developed to investigate how limiting loads at the <b>seat</b> <b>track</b> affect occupant performance. Both finite element and multibody techniques were used to create a detailed model of a typical commercial airplane seat with three occupants. Both a baseline model without energy absorption and a modified model with energy absorption were developed to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of energy absorbing devices between the seat and the <b>seat</b> <b>track...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{benchmarking}} study is presented {{on the performance}} of automotive <b>seat</b> <b>track</b> profiles according to their sensitivity to manufacturing variation. Variation in rail geometry affects the elastic track preload and consequently the rolling effort of the track assembly. Rolling effort must be precisely controlled to achieve customer performance targets. Two benchmarking parameters are relevant to rolling effort: variation in bearing clearance and variation in bearing contact force. These were assessed using statistical tolerance analysis of CAD data, and numerical analysis, respectively. Significant variation in performance was identified for the selected track profiles, which include commercially available designs and proposed concepts. The benchmarking approach demonstrated in this work provides a way of rapidly assessing the relative robustness of automotive <b>seat</b> <b>track</b> designs subject to manufacturing variation. The outcome assists automotive manufacturers to apply a systematic approach to automotive seat design based on a robust design evaluation of alternative embodiments...|$|E
40|$|A <b>Seat</b> <b>Track</b> Attach Mechanism (SAM) is a multiple-use {{clamping}} device {{intended for use}} in mounting various objects on the standard seat tracks used on the International Space Station (ISS). The basic SAM design could also be adapted to other settings in which seat tracks are available: for example, SAM-like devices {{could be used as}} universal aircraft-seat-track mounting clamps. A SAM (see figure) is easily installed by inserting it in a <b>seat</b> <b>track,</b> then actuating a locking lever to clamp the SAM to the track. The SAM includes an over-center locking feature that prevents premature disengagement that could be caused by some inadvertent movements of persons or objects in the vicinity. A SAM can be installed in, or removed from, any position along a <b>seat</b> <b>track,</b> without regard for the locations of the circular access holes. Hence, one or more SAM(s) can be used to mount an object or objects on a track or a pair of tracks in an infinite number of preferred configurations. A SAM can be incorporated into a dual swivel device, so that two of the SAMs can be made to lock onto two side-by-side seat tracks simultaneously, as would be the case in a standard ISS rack bay where two side-by-side racks reside. The main benefit to using two SAMs in a side-by-side arrangement is to provide a coupled load. By picking up load points on two seat tracks, a coupled loading is created, improving the stability and strength since the load is spread to two seat tracks at a short distance...|$|E
