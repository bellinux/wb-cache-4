40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate the effect of drip irrigation under different population arrangements on the phytometric features, coffee productivity and bean size classification according to <b>sieve</b> <b>retention.</b> The experiment with Coffea arabica L. cv Catuaí was carried out in Mococa, São Paulo, Brazil. The experimental design was a 6 x 2 factorial scheme in randomized blocks, with four replications. The six densities of plantation were E 1 (1. 60 x 0. 50 m); E 2 (1. 60 x 0. 75 m); E 3 (1. 60 x 1. 00 m); E 4 (3. 20 x 0. 50 m); E 5 (3. 20 x 0. 75 m) and E 6 (3. 20 x 1. 00 m), which were divided according to the availability of water (irrigated- I- or non-irrigated- NI-groups). Data were submitted to analysis of variance and averages compared by Tukey test at 1 and 5 % of probability. Descriptive analysis of coffee beans according to sieve classification was performed. Irrigation promoted an increase in plant height, crown diameter and production of processed coffee when compared with the NI group. Interaction between population arrangement and irrigation was observed, with an increase in production and crown diameter as the spacing wa...|$|E
40|$|Replicate {{samples of}} cobbles and loose {{inorganic}} and organic matter collected from 3 stream-riffle sites with different periphyton communities were {{passed through a}} geometric series of 9 sieves (0. 063 - 16 mm mesh) to quantify <b>sieve</b> <b>retention</b> probabilities of benthic invertebrates. Sieves retained all organisms with a body length > 10 x the mesh size. Logistic regression models were estimated to describe retention probabilities as functions of body length and mesh size. Retention probability functions differed slightly but significantly among sites, operators, and taxa. Retention probabilities were higher for samples containing filamentous algae, which entangled invertebrates. Size distributions of straight, elongate invertebrates (e. g., oligochaetes, midge larvae) retained by sieves were more variable than distributions of more spherical organisms (e. g., gastropods). On average, the 1 -mm sieve retained > 90 % of invertebrate biomass but < 33 % of individuals retained by a 63 -μm sieve. Size distribution of organisms retained by coarse sieves (≥ 1 mm), combined with logistic functions predicting retention probability, {{can be used to}} describe abundance, biomass, and size distribution of organisms retained by fine sieves. These results suggest that unbiased descriptions of benthic communities can be obtained with relatively little effort by using a minimum sieve mesh size of 1 mm...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} crops used for feeding of animals is maize (Zea mays L). Kernels of maize contain 7 - 13 g of protein/ 100 g of dry matter, and they are protagonist of chemical and physical changes during the processing of raw material. There are several methods for determination of protein changes during thermal processing. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate application of Lab-on-a-Chip electrophoresis as a method for qualitative and quantitative determination of maize protein modifications during pelleting. Parameters which were varied during pelleting process were diameter of sieve openings of the hammer mill and duration of steam conditioning process. According to the results, conditioning retention time of 5 min could be considered as mild in terms of protein changes for samples ground to pass 3 and 4 mm <b>sieve.</b> Conditioning <b>retention</b> time of 10 min was long enough for achieving of high level of protein modifications for all samples. Regression analysis of obtained data showed that both independent parameters had significant (p < 0. 05) influence on response variable (protein solubility). Protein electrophoregrams of investigated samples were qualitatively nearly identical, but quantitative differences occurred, especially in the range 18 - 85 kDa of protein molecular weight (MW). Results in this paper have proven that Lab-on-a-Chip electrophoresis registered changes in protein structure even when protein solubility was not changed, unlike other conventional methods. This method can be used for determination of degree of protein changes during pelleting process with remarkable certainty...|$|R
40|$|Particle {{size and}} size {{distribution}} {{is an important}} parameter in solid liquid separation process especially in granular bed filtration and in dynamic microfiltration. This paper discusses their effects on the above processes from extensive experimental data obtained. In granular bed filtration, the experimental {{results showed that the}} initial efficiency follows the pattern reported by previous experimental and theoretical studies, i. e., lower efficiency for particles which fall in the range of critical size of 1 m. However, the particle removal during the transient stage increased with an increase in particle size for the range of sizes studied. An attempt was made to quantify these effects in granular bed filtration using semi-empirical approach. In dynamic membrane filtration also, the particle size {{plays a major role in}} the retention. However, despite the relative thickness of the membrane (compared to particle size) dynamic microfiltration appears more as a <b>sieving</b> process; the <b>retention</b> is mainly related to the largest pore size. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Sweet maize seeds present lower {{physiologic}} quality, {{when compared}} to regular maize seeds, due {{to the influence of}} several features, such as the seed size and shape. Thus, this study aimed at evaluating the seed physiologic quality of two sweet maize cultivars (BR- 401 and BR- 402), separately classified according to thickness, by using slotted screen sieves (8 / 64 " x 3 / 4, 9 / 64 " x 3 / 4, 10 / 64 " x 3 / 4, 11 / 64 " x 3 / 4, 12 / 64 " x 3 / 4 and 13 / 64 " x 3 / 4), and width, with round screen sieves (17 / 64 ", 18 / 64 ", 19 / 64 ", 20 / 64 ", 21 / 64 " and 22 / 64 "). For each cultivar, sorted lots were compared with the unrated batch, following a completely randomized design, in a 2 x 7 factorial scheme, with four replications. The biometric parameters evaluated were <b>sieve</b> <b>retention,</b> 100 seeds weight and water content. The physiologic quality was determined according to the first counting, germination, cold test, accelerated aging, electric conductivity and seedling emergence in the field. The classification with sieves improved the physiologic quality of sweet maize seeds. Seeds with intermediate thickness, for both cultivars, generally presented greater vigor. Concerning width, larger seeds, for the BR- 401 cultivar, and intermediate seeds, for the BR- 402 cultivar, showed better physiologic quality...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{concern is}} being paid {{to the health and}} {{environmental}} risk caused by trace natural and synthetic hormones discharged from sewage treatment plant (STPs). This study, which {{is part of a larger}} project on investigation of hybrid membrane processes for trace hormones removal, focuses on binding of hormones to microfiltration hollow fibre membranes in filtration of solutions containing trace hormones. The adsorption capacity of the membrane, kinetics of adsorption and desorption of to/from microfiltration hollow fibre membranes, and the factors affecting adsorption to the membranes have been studied using estrone as model solute. The experiments showed that the adsorption of estrone to the microfiltration membranes could result in high retention of estrone molecules. However, since the mechanism of retention is adsorption rather than <b>sieving,</b> the <b>retention</b> decreases with increase in the amount of estrone accumulated on the membrane and breakthrough occurs when the accumulated estrone on the membrane reaches an equilibrium concentration corresponding to the feed concentration. For long-term operation, although membranes could be saturated by hormone molecules the membrane processes could still have a function of buffer for instantaneous high hormones concentration because the saturation surface concentration increased with the increase in the feed concentration. In addition, the experiments also indicated that the adsorption capacity of the membranes for hormones could be affected by membrane types, pH, affinity of hormones to water, as well as the presence of other organics. These results are of relevance to the potential release of trace hormones from water treatment systems where microfiltration membranes are used as a process barrier...|$|R

40|$|Various {{distributions}} of particles of sweet-potato starch were created under different regimes of hammer milling in an experiment, which was investigating the digestibility of the sweet-potato flour. The experimental factors were {{the size of}} the <b>retention</b> <b>sieve</b> and the number of re-grinding passes through the hammer mill. Twenty four flour samples were produced altogether from six milling settings (two replicates and two sub-samples from each). The distributional data were generated by a particle size analyser (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern WR 14 1 XZ, UK) in a form of a long binned array of volumetric percentages. The particle size distributions were obviously, and in a complex way, changing with changes in the milling energy. The average volumetric diameter alone was not an adequate summary for the distributions. It was thus required to construct a tailored algorithm for summarizing the distributional changes and relating them to the digestion rates of flours measured subsequently. Here we report a comparative analysis of the goodness-of-fit of three-component mixtures of log-Normal and two-parameter Weibull distributions, and relate the changes in the parameters of the models to the settings of the mill...|$|R
