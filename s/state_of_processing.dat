Alpha-D-Mannosidases A and B are immunologically identical but {{differ in}} their range of pI values, molecular masses, uptake into fibroblasts and subunit compositions. Alpha-D-Mannosidase A consists of equimolar proportions of subunits of molecular masses 62 kDa and 26 kDa, which are linked by disulphide bridges in the intact enzyme. Alpha-D-Mannosidase B also contains a small subunit, of molecular mass 26 kDa, and a variable mixture of larger subunits, of molecular masses 58 kDa and 62 kDa. The 62 kDa and 58 kDa subunits, but not the 26 kDa one, contain concanavalin A-recognizing glycans. The 58 kDa subunit has a lower pI, contains less high-mannose glycans but probably contains more mannose 6 -phosphate than the 62 kDa subunit. It is postulated that the differences in structure and properties of alpha-D-mannosidases A and B are {{due to differences in}} the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> of the large subunit.

In this paper we implement an architecture which solves and automates the issues of knowledge representation and knowledge management, providing an abstraction layer for distributed development of semantic analysis tools. Furthermore, we enable document interaction and visualization and present current implementations of semantic tools and follow-up applications using this architecture. We identify five different stages, or purposes, which such architecture needs to address, encapsulating each in an independent module. These stages are determined by the different properties of the document formats used, as well as the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> and linguistic enrichment introduced so far.

Spectrolab's experience in the manufacture of 4 to 6 mil 2 cm x 4 cm GaAs cells on a LPE production line is discussed. By thinning the cells at a late <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing,</b> production yields comparable to 12 mil cells have been achieved.

40|$|Performing two cognitively {{demanding}} tasks {{at the same}} time is known to decrease performance. The current study investigates the underlying executive functions of a dual-tasking situation involving the simultaneous performance of decision making under explicit risk and a working memory task. It is suggested that making a decision and performing a working memory task {{at the same time}} should particularly require monitoring - an executive control process supervising behavior and the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> on two tasks. To test the role of a supervisory/monitoring function in such a dual-tasking situation we investigated 122 participants with the Game of Dice Task plus 2 -back task (GDT plus 2 -back task). This dual task requires participants to make decisions under risk and to perform a 2 -back working memory task at the same time. Furthermore, a task measuring a set of several executive functions gathered in the term concept formation (Modified Card Sorting Test, MCST) and the newly developed Balanced Switching Task (BST), measuring monitoring in particular, were used. The results demonstrate that concept formation and monitoring are involved in the simultaneous performance of decision making under risk and a working memory task. In particular, the mediation analysis revealed that BST performance partially mediates the influence of MCST performance on the GDT plus 2 -back task. These findings suggest that monitoring is one important subfunction for superior performance in a dual-tasking situation including decision making under risk and a working memory task...|$|E

Second, the earliest form of the heavy chain detectable by sulfate labeling, as well as the heavy chain sulfated in a cell-free system in the absence of vesicle transport, already contained galactose and sialic acid. Third, sulfate-labeled IgM moved to the cell surface with kinetics identical to those of galactose-labeled IgM. Lastly, IgM labeled with sulfate at 20 degrees C was not transported to the cell surface at 20 degrees C but reached the cell surface at 37 degrees C. The data suggest that within the trans-Golgi, tyrosine sulfation of IgM occurred at least in part after terminal glycosylation and therefore appeared to be the last modification of this constitutively secreted protein before its exit from this compartment. Furthermore, the results establish the covalent modification of amino acid side chains as a novel function of the trans-Golgi...|$|E

To test this hypothesis, MBSR effects were assessed on the simple task of lifting an object. A dual task paradigm was included {{to assess the}} opposite effect of {{a limited amount of}} attention on motor consciousness. In a stimulus-based condition, the subjects’ task was to lift an object that was hefted with weights. In an intentional-based condition, subjects were required to lift a light object while imagining that the object was virtually heavier and thus, adjust their grip voluntarily. The degree of motor consciousness was evaluated by calculating correlation factors for each participant between the grip force level used during the lift trial (lift the object) and that used during its associated reproduce trial (without lifting, indicate the force you think you used in the previous trial). Under dual task condition, motor consciousness decreased for intention- and stimulus-based actions, revealing the importance of top-down attention for building the motor representation that guides action planning. For MBSR-experts, heightened attention provided stronger levels of motor consciousness; this was true for both intention and stimulus-based actions. For controls, heightened attention decreased the capacity to reproduce force levels, suggesting that voluntary top-down attention interfered with the automatic bottom-up emergence of body sensations. Our results provide strong arguments for involvement of two types of attention for the emergence of motor consciousness. Bottom-up attention would serve as an amplifier of motor-sensory afferences; Top down attention would help transfer the motor-sensory content from a pre-conscious to a conscious <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing.</b> MBSR would be a specific state for which both types of attention are optimally combined to provide experts with total experiences of their body in movement...|$|E
40|$|Secretory {{defects in}} {{abnormal}} plasma cells, called Mott cells, {{that appear in}} lymphoid tissues of spontaneously autoimmune, "viable motheaten" (mev/mev) mice lead to deposition of immunoglobulin in RER- bound vesicles. Such vesicles have been termed Russel bodies. Cells with Russel bodies can also be observed rarely in normal animals, usually {{as a result of}} extreme antigenic loads or pathologic states. To understand why these abnormal cells appear commonly in mev/mev mice, we have established a panel of hybridomas that contain Russell bodies. Using immunochemical analysis and immunoelectron microscopy, we have characterized the secretory defects. Although these hybridoma cells synthesize a normal size heavy chain and it associates with light chain, the Russell bodies have many characteristics of inclusion bodies, which commonly appear in cells synthesizing mutant proteins and often are associated with incompletely or abnormally folded proteins. Pulse-chase experiments showed that immunoglobulins synthesized by these hybridomas accumulate rapidly into insoluble complexes and have an intracellular half life approximately 10 time greater than normal immunoglobulins. The defect affected only the immunoglobulin derived from the mev/mev mice and did not affect the secretion of normal immunoglobulin produced by an IgG 1 -secreting fusion partner. In addition to accumulating intracellular immunoglobulins, many mutant cell lines also secreted immunoglobulin. Endoglycosidase H digestion was used to determine the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> of the N-linked carbohydrates on the immunoglobulin molecules. This analysis demonstrated that the N-linked carbohydrates on the secreted immunoglobulin were resistant to endoglycosidase H digestion, indicating that they were processed normally. The insoluble IgM molecules were sensitive to endoglycosidase H, which is consistent with their localization to the RER. We propose several models by which these abnormal immunoglobulin-secreting cells commonly appear in this autoimmune mutant mouse...|$|E

In all, four forms were isolated and partially characterized. Forms A and B, both with a pI greater than 9. 5 and representing 30 % and 60 % respectively of the recovered enzyme activity, were separated by hydroxyapatite chromatography of the enzyme preparation obtained from the Cu 2 +-chelating Sepharose step. Both forms A and B had native molecular masses of 75 kDa. When analysed by SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, form A consists of a single polypeptide of molecular mass 78 kDa, whereas form B contained 48 kDa and 32 kDa polypeptide subunits. Neither form A nor form B was taken up from the culture medium into cultured human skin fibroblasts. The two other forms (C and D), with pI values of 5. 8 and 5. 4 respectively, represented approx. 7 % and 3 % of the total recovered enzyme activity. The native molecular masses of forms C and D were 94 kDa and approx. 75 kDa respectively. Form C contained three polypeptides with molecular masses of 48, 45 and 32 kDa. N-Acetylglucosamine- 6 -sulphate sulphatase activity was measured with a radiolabelled disaccharide substrate derived from heparin. The development of this substrate enabled the isolation and characterization of N-acetylglucosamine- 6 -sulphate sulphatase to proceed efficiently.

40|$|Safeguards data {{reviews of}} MBAs (Material Balance Areas) {{can be seen}} as a {{continuous}} verification process, broken down by the perioding reporting to guarantee the timeliness of inspections. The archive of review reports captures MBA history and its typical operation regularities. Most of these are known to the inspector through the experience s/he gained over the sequence of review exercises. To assist this process effectively, review tools also need to be aware of the MBA's regularities, either by being told (by the inspector) or by learning them from the base of knowledge contained in review archives. For instance, in image reviews, inspectors tell change detection filters where to spot differences in gray-intensity by drawing areas of interest over the image plane. The focus of our work is rather on what review tools can learn in a semi-autonomous way from archives of past and closed reviews, as well as from the on-line compilation of review reports. Along this direction, we presented in previous work software tools that learn improved filtering rules by using the visual appearance of images reviewed by inspectors. In this paper, we argue that also the temporal succession of data should be modeled and considered by review tools. For example, in an MBA, flasks of nuclear material undergo a processing governed by a rather regular sequence of stages. The duration of each stage and the normal succession of processing steps are features that can be learnt. Specifically, we describe a model of flask processing in a MBA based on a hybrid Markov model (hMM). Markov models are discrete-state machines where state-to-state transitions have an associated probability. In our hybrid model, the relation between the observed quantities (e. g. gray-level change in specific image regions) and the underlying process is also dependent on a probabilistic function. A salient benefit of probability frameworks is their inferential capability of learning from historical evidence. Former inspectors' reports can be employed to build a statistical description of the process, and to train the MM. The trained model keeps track of the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> and checks that the consequentiality of events is respected. Irregular event patterns are attributed a high probability of being false positives, and thus discarded from the review. In our experiments on real review data provided by inspectors, we verified that all significant images were still correctly selected by the hMM, whereas the false positives were reduced of a factor between 2. 5 and 10 with respect to the methods currently in use.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{likelihood}} of initiating addictive behaviors is higher during adolescence than during any other developmental period. The differential developmental trajectories of brain regions involved in motivation and control processes {{may lead to}} adolescents’ increased risk taking in general, which may be exacerbated by the neural consequences of drug use. Neuroimaging studies suggest that increased risk-taking behavior in adolescence is related to an imbalance between prefrontal cortical regions, associated with executive functions, and subcortical brain regions related to affect and motivation. Dual-process models of addictive behaviors are similarly concerned with difficulties in controlling abnormally strong motivational processes. We acknowledge concerns raised about dual-process models, but argue {{that they can be}} addressed by carefully considering levels of description: motivational processes and top-down biasing can be understood as intertwined, co-developing components of more versus less reflective <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing.</b> We illustrate this with a model that further emphasizes temporal dynamics. Finally, behavioral interventions for addiction are discussed.
