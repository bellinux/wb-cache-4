2500|$|In 2009, General Martin Luther Agwai, head of {{the joint}} African Union – United Nations Operation, said {{the war was over}} in the region, {{although}} low-level disputes remained. [...] "Banditry, localised issues, people trying to resolve issues over water and land at a local level. But real war as such, I think we are over that," [...] he said. This perspective is contradicted by reports which indicate that violence continues in Darfur while peace efforts have been stalled repeatedly. Violence between Sudan's military and rebel fighters has beset <b>Southern</b> <b>Kordofan</b> and Blue Nile states since disputed state elections in May 2011, an ongoing humanitarian crisis that has prompted international condemnation and U.S. congressional hearings. In 2012, tensions between Sudan and South Sudan reached a boiling point when the Sudanese military bombed territory in South Sudan, leading to hostilities over the disputed Heglig (or Panthou) oil fields located along the Sudan-South Sudan border.|$|E
50|$|Inhabitants {{origins in}} Gedaref have rapidly changed {{during the last}} decades. Dwellers who belong to various nationalities had settled in the area along with the {{indigenous}} people. Today the mosaic of population includes many Sudanese tribes from different regions as far as Dar Fur, <b>Kordofan,</b> <b>southern</b> and northern Sudan. Tribes like Shaigiya, Baggara, Dinka, Fur, Nuba, Masalit, Shukriya, Beja, Hausa people and many other Sudanese tribes are represented in Gedaref. No other city in the Sudan, with exception of Khartoum and Port Sudan has so many dwellers of Foreign origin among its population, as Gedaref. Kurds, Armenians, Panian of India, Greeks, Egyptian Copts, Ethiopians, Eritrean, Somalis, Chadians, Yemenis, Italians has been Sudanized since generations and well integrated in the Gedaref community. The main reason for this gathering of foreign and local groups of people in Gedaref {{can be attributed to}} the Agricultural boom that swept the city and turned it to a major centre of trade in the area.|$|R
40|$|Background: Infection by {{tuberculosis}} and multidrug resistance are increasing in Sudan {{as in many}} other countries. Little data are available about diversity of drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Objectives: This study aimed to determine the drug resistance patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from different regions of Sudan, to study the genetic diversity of drug resistant Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis and}} to determine the phylogenetic relation of resistant isolates. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted during the period June 2008 - June 2010, in nine states of Sudan (Khartoum, Kassala, Gadarif, Gezera, Damazeen, Northern and <b>Southern</b> Sudan, <b>Kordofan</b> and Darfur). The technical work was done at National Health Laboratory and Institute of Endemic Diseases. Sputum samples were collected from 420 pulmonary tuberculosis patients, the patients were consented and fully interviewed. Indirect Ziehl’sNeelsen stain and inoculation onto LJ medium were done. Biochemical tests and Polymerase chain reaction technique were used for characterization of the isolates. In vitro drug sensitivity (proportion method) to the first line anti- tuberculous drugs was done for all isolates. Single step nested PCR and DNA sequencing was done for the resistant strains to determine the diversity of drug resistant isolates. Phylogenetic analysis was used to determine the genetic relation of the drug resistant isolates. Results: The Acid Fast Bacilli smear positive was 94 %. Two hundred and forty two samples were successfully grown on LJ media. Biochemical and molecular methods identified 99. 2 % as Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and 0. 8 % as Mycobacteria other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which were further characterized as M. kansassi and M. avium. On in-vitro drug sensitivity, 48 were resistant isolates; (14. 2 % were resistant to Rifampcin, 11. 3 % to Isoniazid, 10 % to Streptomycin and 7. 08 % to Ethambutol). Four isolates were multi-resistant to the four above mentioned drugs. M. kansassi was resistant to INH and to RIF. Sequencing of the PCR amplified rpoB gene of 28 randomly selected resistant MTBC isolates showed mutations in 9 isolates. One isolate from Kassala had double mutation at codon 516 (GAC → GAA/ Asp →Glu) and codon 526 (CAC→AAC/ His → Asn). One MDR strain from Khartoum North had mutation at codon 516 (GAC→ GTC/ Asp → Val), three MDR strains had harboured the CAC variant at codon 526; one isolate had the CTC mutation at this codon and the other CGC, the third one had the mutant type GAC genotype at the same site. Four isolates; from Kassala, Gadarif, Damazeen and Southern Sudan had single mutation at codon 531 (TTG→ TGG/ Ser→ Leu). Phylogenetic analysis clustered the resistant isolates into five major clusters. Conclusion: The drug resistance rate was 20 % and multidrug resistant was 7. 5 %, however, this result was the first to represent the national resistance rate which is alarming. Isolates from Kassala showed the highest drug resistance rate (49. 1 %) while, Khartoum showed the highest multidrug resistant rate (2. 9 %). High prevalence of resistance to rifampicin was associated with various point mutations in the 81 -bp core region of the rpoB gene. The phylogenetic analysis showed strong relationship between the Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant strains in Sudan, suggesting a common source of resistance...|$|R
40|$|South Sudan gained its {{independence}} in 2011 after two long civil wars that claimed about 2 {{million people and}} displaced almost 4 million. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in 2005 ended Sudan’s decades of civil war with the South. The causes of the civil wars were underdevelopment, marginalisation of the <b>Southern</b> Region, Darfur, <b>Kordofan,</b> the Blue Nile, the eastern regions, and the Khartoum-led government’s desire to make the entire Sudan and an Arab state with Islam as its religion. At independence, South Sudan went away with 3 / 4 of the oil that was unified Sudan’s primary commodity. From oil revenues, the government constructed refineries and oil pipelines in the north leaving the South underdeveloped. South Being a landlocked country, it relies on Sudan’s pipeline. Sudan has been charging South Sudan almost $ 25 per barrel (the most expensive in the world) {{for the use of}} the pipeline. After South Sudan’s independence, many issues remained unresolved with its neighbour, Sudan. Among the unresolved issues include the borderline and the disputed areas like Abyei. This thesis aims at examining how the oil and pipeline have shaped the post-independence relationship between the two nations. The thesis looks at how oil can bring peace between the two countries while highlighting which country is benefiting more from the oil. The Study used a qualitative method with the use of interviews, documents, books and online journals blended to compile data presented in this paper. One on one interviews were done with respondents in April 2015 in Juba, South Sudan. The respondents included University and college lecturers, politicians, embassy officials, researchers, journalists, editors, civil society organisations as well as policy analysts. The findings have been analysed using the offensive realism theory. The Analysis indicates that South Sudan is rich in oil but lacks access to markets, refineries and the oil pipeline. On the other hand, Sudan has less oil but has a well-developed oil industry supported by refineries and the pipeline. To compensate for the shortfall or loss of oil to South Sudan, Sudan is charging high prices that bring to the 50 / 50 ratio, a ratio that was there during the CPA period. The thesis found that the oil has affected the unresolved issues, especially those concerning the disputed areas. Both are weak states with civil wars going on in their respective territories straining the relationship further. There are accusations of each country supporting the rebels in the other country.

60|$|The {{victory was}} decisive. <b>Southern</b> <b>Kordofan</b> {{was at the}} feet of the priest of Abba. Stores of arms and {{ammunition}} had fallen into his hands. Thousands of every class hastened to join his standard. No one doubted that he was the divine messenger sent to free them from their oppressors. The whole of the Arab tribes all over the Soudan rose at once. The revolt broke out simultaneously in Sennar and Darfur, and spread to provinces still more remote. The smaller Egyptian posts, the tax-gatherers and local administrators, were massacred in every district. Only the larger garrisons maintained themselves in the principal towns. They were at once blockaded. All communications were interrupted. All legal authority was defied. Only the Mahdi was obeyed.|$|E
60|$|For {{nearly a}} year no further {{operations}} were undertaken against the Khalifa, and he remained all through {{the spring and summer}} of 1899 supreme in Kordofan, reorganising his adherents and plundering the country--a chronic danger to the new Government, a curse to the local inhabitants, and a most serious element of unrest. The barren and almost waterless regions into which he had withdrawn presented very difficult obstacles to any military expedition, and although powerful forces were still concentrated at Khartoum, the dry season and the uncertain whereabouts of the enemy prevented action. But towards the end of August trustworthy information was received by the Intelligence Department, through the agency of friendly tribesmen, that the Khalifa, with all his army, was encamped at Jebel Gedir--that same mountain in <b>Southern</b> <b>Kordofan</b> to which nearly twenty years before he and the Mahdi had retreated after the flight from Abba Island. Here among old memories which his presence revived he became at once a centre of fanaticism. Night after night he slept upon the Mahdi's stone; and day after day tales of his dreams were carried by secret emissaries not only throughout the Western Soudan, but into the Ghezira and even to Khartoum. And now, his position being definite and his action highly dangerous, it was decided to move against him.|$|E
