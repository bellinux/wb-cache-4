5|$|Ovulation is the <b>second</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ovarian {{cycle in}} which a mature egg is {{released}} from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct. During the follicular phase, estradiol suppresses release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. When the egg has nearly matured, levels of estradiol reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates {{the production of a}} large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.|$|E
5|$|The proliferative {{phase is}} the <b>second</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uterine cycle when {{estrogen}} causes {{the lining of}} the uterus to grow, or proliferate, during this time. As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of estradiol, and estrogen. The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium. The estrogen also stimulates crypts in the cervix to produce fertile cervical mucus, which may be noticed by women practicing fertility awareness.|$|E

Upon his release in December 1897, Luna studied field fortifications, guerrilla warfare, organization, and other aspects of military science under Gerard Leman, who would later be the commanding general of the fortress at Liège. He also read extensively about the discipline when he was at the Ateneo de Madrid. The <b>second</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revolution began with the return of Emilio Aguinaldo to Cavite in 1898.
