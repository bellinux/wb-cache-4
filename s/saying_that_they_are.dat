As Adjeng lies on the bed, she recalls how her mother's lover raped her and how her mother murdered him. As the phone rings, Adjeng watches the people from her past going about life in a residential complex, smiles, and returns to writing.|$|E
5|$|While {{talking to}} the camera, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) reveal that Jim was offered an {{entrepreneurial}} sports job by an old college friend based on an idea the two had in college. Jim tells the camera that he turned it down, because {{it would not be}} good for his family. Pam and Jim begin to take off their microphones and Pam makes a remark, noting that, after nine years, the cameramen should have enough footage for a documentary. One of the cameramen then addresses the two, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> more interested in the developments of the office workers themselves, especially Jim and Pam, rather than the office now. Jim looks pensive when Pam tells the cameramen that, with work and kids, nothing interesting will happen to the Halperts in a long time.|$|E
5|$|Lois has booked Cheesie Charlie's for Stewie's {{upcoming}} {{first birthday}} party and sends Peter, along with Chris, {{to drop off}} the deposit check at the restaurant. However, once they arrive, they seek {{the opportunity to play}} with all the machines, causing Peter to lose his watch in a claw machine. A little boy wins his watch, which causes Peter to become angry and tries to force the watch off the child. The Manager sees this and asks Peter to leave. But once Peter shows the deposit check, he immediately apologizes and exclaims how they are very excited to host Stewie's birthday party. Peter, angered by how he was treated, states that they won't be celebrating Stewie's party there, which causes a crowd of people to circle around Manager shouting for the reservation. Peter, realizing what he has just done, immediately returns home with a poorly crafted lie in an attempt to evade Lois' aggravation which involves him <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> Nazis who torture, kill and kidnap people. He pretends that he's already planned an extravagant party at home so that Lois doesn't have do any work.|$|E

25|$|The {{narrative}} then {{switches to}} the south. The Gibeonites trick the Israelites into entering {{an alliance with}} them by <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not Canaanites. This prevents the Israelites from exterminating them, but they are enslaved instead. An alliance of Amorite kingdoms headed by the Canaanite king of Jerusalem is defeated with Yahweh's miraculous help of stopping the Sun and the Moon, and hurling down large hailstones. (Joshua 10:10-14) The enemy kings were eventually hanged on trees. The Deuteronomist author may have used the then-recent 701BCE campaign of the Assyrian king Sennacherib in the Kingdom of Judah as his model; the hanging of the captured kings is in accordance with Assyrian practice of the 8th century BCE.|$|E
25|$|Popper {{regarded}} {{theories that}} have survived criticism as better corroborated {{in proportion to}} the amount and stringency of the criticism, but, {{in sharp contrast to the}} inductivist theories of knowledge, emphatically as less likely to be true. Popper held that seeking for theories with a high probability of being true was a false goal that is in conflict with the search for knowledge. Science should seek for theories that are most probably false on the one hand (which is the same as <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> highly falsifiable and so there are lots of ways that they could turn out to be wrong), but still all actual attempts to falsify them have failed so far (that they are highly corroborated).|$|E

25|$|In 2007, in {{response}} to lobbying scandals involving, among others, Jack Abramoff and Duke Cunningham, Congress passed a lobbying and ethics reform package to which Vitter proposed a package of five amendments. The Senate approved three that limited which legislators' spouses could lobby the Senate, created criminal penalties for legislators and executive branch officials who falsify financial reports, and doubled the penalties for lobbyists who failed to comply with disclosure requirements. The Senate rejected prohibiting legislators from paying their families with campaign funds with some saying it was unrelated to the current legislation and others that the payments were not a problem. Additionally, they tabled his proposal to define Indian tribes as corporations and its members as stockholders {{so that they are}} required to contribute to candidates through political action committees instead of their tribal treasury. Senators objected <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> already subjected to campaign laws for unincorporated entities and individuals and that the proposal was singling them out unfairly.

He praised the pairing of Darryl and Val, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> better matched to be the series' [...] "new" [...] Jim and Pam than Andy and Erin. Cindy White of IGN said that the episode proved the series was [...] "on a hot streak". She mainly liked the storylines taking place in Tallahassee and said {{that the end of the}} Dwight-Nellie storyline was a [...] "nice bit of character development". She was also very positive to Baumgarter's directing in the episode, saying he [...] "nailed" [...] the documentary format of the episode. She went on to slightly criticize the Scranton storyline and wrote that she hoped the writers would wait before putting Val and Darryl together. She ultimately gave the episode a 7.5/10.|$|E

Sometime later, Hurley's dad (Cheech Marin) gives Hurley his newly rebuilt 1970s Camaro, at a surprise birthday party. Hurley, however, becomes panicked and runs away when he notices that the car's odometer displays the numbers. In Seoul, South Korea, Sun visits her father and informs him that she used the money from her settlement with Oceanic Airlines to buy a controlling interest in his company because she blames him for her husband's, Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), death. In the final flashforward, Jack eulogizes his deceased father, Christian Shephard (John Terry). After the ceremony, Carole Littleton (Susan Duerden), Claire's mother, reveals to him that Claire is his half-sister.|$|E

He noted that some songs were [...] "very atmospheric" [...] while others maintained [...] "the hard rock and the heavy stuff". Jon Wiederhorn of MTV said that [...] "for every thrash riff there's a tunefully grungy passage, for every flailing guitar line there's a rock-radio hook." [...] When talking about the track [...] "30/30-150", he said parts are [...] "bludgeoning, barbed and heavy" [...] while others are [...] "soaring and triumphant" [...] with the production of Raskulinecz helping to balance the album's heaviness with its radio-accessibility. Come What(ever) Mays lyrics include themes of [...] "pain, pleasure, happiness, and grief". The diversity in subjects is evident throughout the album; songs including [...] "Come What(ever) May" [...] were politically influenced while the track [...] "Socio" [...] is about [...] "social anxiety attacks" [...] that Taylor suffered. [...] "Zzyzx Rd" [...] is a love song written to Taylor's wife for helping him in his struggles against alcoholism and contemplation of suicide. [...] "I've never written anything like that before, but it was very important for me to tell the world not only how much she saved me, but how much she means to me," [...] said Taylor.

Fehintola Betiku and Emily Sheridan for the Daily Mail described the video as [...] "sultry" [...] and added: [...] "Little Mix are worlds apart from the four-piece who won The X Factor last year in this monochrome four minute clip." [...] A writer for The Huffington Post complimented the group's highly stylised look and mean and moody attitude. Clemmie Moore of the Daily Mirror complimented the group's appearance in the video, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> [...] "looking hot." [...] Gordon Smart of The Sun described the group's look in the music video as [...] "fierce" [...] and [...] "glamourous". Natalie Wall from Cosmopolitan labelled the music video [...] "deliciously dark" [...] and likened the group's look in the video to that from their [...] "E.T." [...] performance on The X Factor in 2011. Promo News' David Knight positively reviewed the video: [...] "Sarah Chatfield makes an impressive return to British pop, by channeling a little bit of Sin City in her sassy and visually bold video for Little Mix's 'DNA': Sarah turns the X Factor-honed girls from glamourous pop stars into equally glamourous [...] stalkers in a noirish story of obsession." [...] Knight added, [...] "The 'DNA' video is beautifully shot by Will Bex, with stark contrasts, dramatic camera angles and heavy skies pushing the film noir-meets-comic book look".

500|$|An {{aspect of}} {{gameplay}} in Murder on the Orient Express which received largely negative reactions was the repetitive nature of many tasks the player must complete. 2404 accused {{the game of}} reducing Christie's novel, and the game, {{into a series of}} repetitive and secretarial tasks, such as collecting fingerprints, passports, and other random items. The site further {{went on to say that}} the player is made to feel [...] "like a secretary for Poirot." [...] Game Over Online agreed with this view, saying that much of the game consisted of [...] "goofy little errands" [...] such as completing tasks for characters and mindlessly searching for objects. Eurogamer provides an example of this, by saying that at one point in the game the player is required to go through each cabin checking the shoe sizes of the various passengers' shoes to check if one matches shoe prints outside the train. The inventory system featured in Murder on the Orient Express has also received significant criticism. IGN complained that instead of being able to find item combinations through trial and error in the main screen, the player is forced to drag items to a separate screen, leading to tedious gameplay. Some reviewers, in contrast, praised the inventory system, with Quandary calling it intuitive, and easy for players to organize. The puzzles in Murder on the Orient Express received positive responses from some reviewers. GameSpot commented favourably on the relatively small number of puzzles in the game, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> integrated fairly well within the plot, and are not excessively difficult. The review went on to say that later puzzles in the game often rely more heavily on inventory combinations, but are still reasonably satisfying to solve. Game Over Online, in comparison, accused the game of giving the player too little information to solve puzzles, and also called the puzzles convoluted. The choice of the developers of Murder on the Orient Express to use Antoinette Marceau, rather than Poirot, as the protagonist and player character was criticized by some. 2404 disapproved of the choice, accusing the developers of not fully utilizing the talent of David Suchet, arguably the most famous and successful portrayer of Poirot. The reviewer even went so far as to tell AWE Productions to [...] "make use of talent like David Suchet when you've got it." [...] Like its predecessor, Murder on the Orient Express was criticized for diverging from Christie's original ending. Adventure Gamers called the new ending [...] "a little too contrived for the game's good." [...] 2404 also disapproved of the ending, commenting that it goes off in too much of a Hollywood direction, and that the original ending is much better and a far more satisfying conclusion.|$|E
