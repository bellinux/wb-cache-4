5|$|Tillingbourne {{introduced}} a new tourist route {{in the summer of}} 1995. Operating on Sundays for <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> it provided a circular service linking Guildford, Godalming and Cranleigh with a number of nearby rural locations not served by other routes. Although similar services were operated by London & Country and Nostalgiabus, the new service was designed to avoid any direct competition. The route was operated with a Bristol SU single-decker acquired from a bus preservationist.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly {{continued}} {{to work as a}} schoolteacher after he broke into international cricket, {{but at the end of}} 1934, after missing more than <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> in England, he resigned from his government post, reasoning that his career could not progress if he was going to be overseas so often. However, he had not made any plans for his future employment. Soon after, O'Reilly received an offer to work as a sportsgoods salesman for the department store David Jones with sporting leave entitlements. The Premier of New South Wales, Bertram Stevens, tried to coax O'Reilly into staying in the government education system, offering him a post at Sydney Boys High School if he returned to STC to complete the Bachelor of Arts that he had abandoned a decade before.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War refocused {{discussions about}} the road. There were fears that Great Britain would enter {{on the side of}} the Confederacy during the early days of the war. British troops were as close to Michigan as Ontario, and more than half of the copper used in the US came from mines along the {{proposed}} roadway. Control of the area could have been established by seizing the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, severing communication lines through the Great Lakes. If the locks fell to an enemy force, no troops or supplies could be moved to the Copper Country except by land. The road was also needed during the five or <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> that transportation on the Great Lakes was barred by ice or stormy weather.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Sevigny {{began her}} five-season {{run in the}} HBO {{television}} series Big Love, about a family of fundamentalist Mormon polygamists. She played Nicolette Grant, the conniving, shopaholic daughter of a cult leader and second wife to a polygamist husband, played by Bill Paxton. Sevigny found even more mainstream success with a role in her first big-budget production as Robert Graysmith's wife Melanie in David Fincher's Zodiac (2007), telling {{the true story of}} San Francisco's infamous Zodiac Killer. In 2009, Sevigny starred in the independent psychological thriller film The Killing Room, and Werner Herzog's My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done, a crime horror film based on murderer Mark Yavorsky, produced by David Lynch. Sevigny also had a voice part in the independent documentary film, Beautiful Darling (2010), narrating the life of trans woman Warhol superstar Candy Darling through Darling's diaries and personal letters. Throughout 2009, Sevigny continued working on Big Loves fourth season; when filming the series, she spent <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> living outside of Los Angeles near Santa Clarita, away from her home in New York City.|$|E
5|$|Once {{rebuilding}} began, {{the poor}} rebuilt their basic {{housing in the}} same primitive fashion as before. By contrast, the wealthiest residents, both secular and spiritual, became caught in an almost manic orgy of building. Most members of the nobility had several homes in Sicily. For one thing, the Spanish viceroy spent <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> in Palermo and six in Catania, holding court in each city, and hence members of the aristocracy needed a town palazzo in each city. Once the palazzi in devastated Catania were rebuilt in the new fashion, the palazzi in Palermo seemed antiquated by comparison, so they too were eventually rebuilt. Following this, {{from the middle of}} the 18th century, villas to retire to in the autumn, essentially status symbols, were built at the fashionable enclave at Bagheria. This pattern was repeated, on a smaller scale, throughout the lesser cities of Sicily, each city providing a more entertaining social life and a magnetic draw for the provincial aristocrat than their country estate. The country estate also did not escape the building mania. Often Baroque wings or new façades were added to ancient castles, or country villas were completely rebuilt. Thus the frenzy of building gained momentum until the increasingly fantastical Baroque architecture demanded by these hedonistic patrons reached its zenith in the mid-18th century.|$|E
5|$|The low {{casualties}} the Commonwealth {{air forces}} incurred during the Battle of Normandy {{led to an}} over-supply of trained aircrew. While the number of pilots and other airmen undergoing training through the EATS had begun to be reduced in early 1944, by 30 June {{there were thousands of}} qualified airmen—including 3,000 Australians—in the UK waiting for posts in operational units. This number greatly exceeded the requirements of the Allied air forces. Accordingly, the flow of airmen from EATS training facilities in Canada to the UK was greatly cut back, and Australia ceased sending airmen overseas for training under the scheme in August. While 1,245 Australian airmen arrived in the UK during the last six months of 1944 (a reduction from the 5,181 who had arrived in the first <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year),</b> only those who were qualified as air gunners were typically ever assigned to combat units. It was not possible to find flying positions for most of the remaining unattached airmen who arrived after June 1944, and some were posted back to Australia; the remainder {{spent the rest of the}} war in training courses and various non-flying roles.|$|E

25|$|Different deals, half {{deals and}} {{possible}} deals were {{done over the}} years, with the Premier of Victoria, John Cain, Jr., even becoming involved.

In the mid-1980s, a deal was done where the VFL was given its own members area in the Southern Stand.|$|E
25|$|Greater Sudbury has a humid {{continental}} climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfb). This region has warm and often hot summers with long, cold and snowy winters. It is situated {{north of the}} Great Lakes, making it prone to arctic air masses. Monthly precipitation is equal year round, with snow cover expected <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> Although extreme weather events are rare, {{one of the worst}} tornadoes in Canadian history struck the city and its suburbs on August 20, 1970, killing six people, injuring two hundred, and causing more than C$17 million in damages.|$|E

25|$|The area, part {{of which}} is within the Arctic Circle, has a subarctic climate with very cold winters lasting up to <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> Permafrost and tundra cover {{a large part of}} the region. Average winter {{temperatures}} range from −19°C to −38°C (even lower in the interior), and average summer temperatures, from +3°C to +16°C. There are rich reserves of gold, silver, tin, tungsten, mercury, copper, antimony, coal, oil, and peat. Twenty-nine zones of possible oil and gas accumulation have been identified in the Sea of Okhotsk shelf. Total reserves are estimated at 3.5 billion tons of equivalent fuel, including 1.2 billion tons of oil and 1.5 billion m3 of gas.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate in}} all the islands is tropical, with hot and humid weather, {{although}} inland regions in the larger islands have more temperate climates. Regions falling within the rain shadows (southern coasts of Jamaica and Trinidad and eastern coasts of the Lesser Antilles) are relatively drier. There are two seasons annually: the dry season for the first <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> and the rainy season (also known as the hurricane season) {{in the second half}} of the year. Many of the islands fall within the traditional hurricane belt, with the exception of Trinidad (although it occasionally experiences low latitude hurricanes) and thus are at risk from potential wind and flood damage.|$|E
25|$|Currently, the Kobuk River in {{its middle}} and lower reaches is an anastomizing stream, with several braided {{channels}} in places, wide migrating meander bends, and oxbow lakes. It {{is controlled by}} yearly cycles of freeze and thaw, much like its surrounding landscape. For <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> the river is largely still, frozen on top by {{a thick layer of}} ice. In the spring, warmer temperatures cause this ice to begin to melt. But the resulting process is not gradual. Rather, the pressure of melting ice from upstream builds up upon ice “dams” in the river’s channel, eventually causing an “ice break-up” event, in which a flood of ice and water moves powerfully downstream.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> three governments have been changed. The summer of 2012 {{was marked by}} a {{large-scale}} political crisis, fed by accusations of plagiarism to PSD-backed Prime Minister Victor Ponta and culminating with the suspension of President Traian Băsescu. Although the presidential impeachment referendum showed that over 80% of the voters wanted his dismissal, the referendum was invalidated by the Constitutional Court due to presence below 50% at polls. During this period, Romania was warned by Western powers {{about the state of}} democracy, inasmuch as the dismissal of the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies was made in a shady manner, and prominent figures of PSD, including Vice-President Liviu Dragnea, were accused of vote rigging in the referendum.|$|E
25|$|Green {{dared not}} refuse the AFL {{executive}} council's instructions {{to undertake a}} joint organizing drive, {{but he did not}} wholeheartedly implement a plan, either. For the first <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> Green did nothing. After the creation of the federal Steel Labor Relations Board in late June 1935 (an independent labor relations board created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt because of the failures of the National Labor Board), Green worked with Tighe, steel industry executives and the steel board to create a plan to allow collective bargaining in the steel industry. The talks dragged on {{through the end of the}} year. The sticking point was the AFL's demand for representational exclusivity (the concept that if a majority of workers voted for the union then all employees in the bargaining unit should belong to the union).|$|E
25|$|For {{about four}} months after the {{opposition}} of Jupiter (from L to K in the diagram below), it is possible to view emergences of Io from its eclipses, while for {{about four months}} before the opposition (from F to G), it is possible to view immersions of Io into Jupiter's shadow. For about five or <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> around the point of conjunction, it is impossible to observe the eclipses of Io at all because Jupiter is too close (in the sky) to the sun. Even during the periods before and after opposition, not all of the eclipses of Io can be observed from a given location on the Earth's surface: some eclipses will occur during the daytime for a given location, while other eclipses will occur while Jupiter is below the horizon (hidden by the Earth itself).|$|E
