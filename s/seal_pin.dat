50|$|In {{the initial}} stages of the War in Afghanistan, USSOCOM forces linked up with CIA Paramilitary Officers from Special Activities Division to defeat the Taliban without the need for {{large-scale}} conventional forces. This {{was one of the biggest}} successes of the global War on Terrorism.These units linked up several times during this war and engaged in several furious battles with the enemy. One such battle happened during Operation Anaconda the mission to squeeze life out of a Taliban and Al-Qaeda stronghold dug deep into the Shah-i-Kot mountains of eastern Afghanistan. The operation was seen as one of the heaviest and bloodiest fights in the War in Afghanistan.The battle on an Afghan mountaintop called Takur Ghar featured special operations forces from all 4 services and the CIA. Navy SEALs, Army Rangers, Air Force Combat Controllers, and Pararescuemen fought against entrenched Al-Qaeda fighters atop a 10000 ft mountain. Subsequently, the entrenched Taliban became targets of every asset in the sky. According to an executive summary, the battle of Takur Ghar was the most intense firefight American special operators have been involved in since 18 U.S. Army Rangers were killed in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1993.During Operation Red Wings on 28 June 2005, four Navy <b>SEALs,</b> <b>pinned</b> down in a firefight, radioed for help.

50|$|Both SEAL Team FOUR and SEAL Team SIX, the {{predecessor}} to DEVGRU, {{participated in the}} US invasion of Grenada. The SEALs' two primary missions were the extraction of Grenada's Governor-General and the capture of Grenada's only radio tower. Neither mission was well briefed or sufficiently supported with timely intelligence and the SEALs ran into trouble from the very beginning. On Oct 24, 1983, 12 operators from SEAL Team SIX and 4 Air Force Combat Control Team members(CCT) conducted a predawn combat airborne water insertion from C130 Hercules with Zodiac inflatable rubber boats 40 kilometers north of Point Salinas, Grenada. The team inserted with full combat gear in bad weather with low visibility conditions and high winds. Four SEALs drowned and were never recovered. SEALs split into two teams and proceeded to their objectives. After digging in at the Governor's mansion, the SEALs realized they had forgotten to load their cryptographic satellite phone. As Grenadian and Cuban troops surrounded the team, the SEALs' only radio ran out of battery power, and they used the mansion's land line telephone to call in AC-130 gunship fire support. The <b>SEALs</b> were <b>pinned</b> down in the mansion overnight and were relieved and extracted {{by a group of}} Marines the following morning.|$|R
40|$|The beam {{position}} monitor (BPM) {{was designed}} to provide a robust UHV feedthru and a reliable electromagnetic sensor. Stringent resolution requirements at low beam currents, bunch parameters, along with mechanical and chamber requirements produced challenges in the electrical, thermal, and structural design of the BPM's. Numerical modeling and experimental analyses were used to optimize the design. The higher order modes (HOM's) and beam impedance were modeled using MAFIA. Measurements agreed with the calculated 1 Ω transfer impedance at the 952 MHz signal processing frequency, and the first two HOM's found in MAFIA. Tests and analysis both showed the button signal power approaching 40 W. Temperature and stress distributions were analyzed using this power loading with ANSYS.

40|$|Abstract [...] Gearboxes {{are used}} in almost every {{industry}} right from power to marine, and also include agriculture, textile, automobiles, aerospace, shipping etc. A gearbox is a gear or a hydraulic system responsible for transmitting mechanical power from a prime mover (an engine or electric motor) into some form of useful output. It is referred to the metal casing in which a number of gears are <b>sealed.</b> Pivot <b>pin</b> fitted in lever of gearbox which is used for engaging the gears in gearbox. It is seen that the component Pivot Pin has failed in few Vehicles after completion of certain Kms. In the proposed work, design of pivot pin of gearbox is studied {{and with the help}} of design, the component studied in detail on this particular failure and by considering different manufacturing processes, suitable results will be calculated. Later on, design modifications are done on Pivot pin. This technical paper is on failure diagnosis and modification in design of pivot pin gearbox used in vehicle. ANSYS is used for stress analysis. The main objective for carrying out this analysis was to improve the life of the pivot pin. After the analysis of pivot pin from existing gearbox the reason for failure was found. The reason for failure of the pivot pin was due to fatigue failure. This is caused due to Breaking of all the Pins is in the same manner at the same cross section near the Relief Groove. To relieve these stress concentration modifications in the design of pivot pin were done and after that again stress analysis of the modified pivot pin carried out. I...|$|R
40|$|Due to Challenger {{space shuttle}} {{accident}} in 1986, significant {{research has been}} done concerning structural behavior of field joints in solid rocket boosters (SRB). The structural deformations between the clevis inner leg and the tang (male-to-female parts of joint), the sealing of the O-ring to prevent the hot gas in joints, has been neglected causing the failure of the vehicle. Redesigning the field joint in SRB engine by accurate analysis of dynamic and thermal loads and by design of insulator and good O-ring, the leakiness of combustion hot gases was eliminated. Some parts of field joint such as capture feature (CF) and its third O-ring, J-leg insulator and shim were added to redesigned field joint. Also, some adjustments in <b>sealing</b> system and <b>pins</b> were done to promote the efficiency of the field joint. Due to different experimental analysis on assembled field joints with default imperfections, redesigned joints operated well. These redesigned field joints are commonly used in aerospace and mechanical structures.

Firstly we have to do the marketing study in order to estimate the amount of the production we expect to sell in the first and the following years. The marketing study is done by analyzing the data from Spain and European database in industrial section together with the assumption based on reality. The results from this part are the expected production per year which can let us make the decision for the machine type and it will be used in economic study as well. Then the proper manufacturing process and specific tool’s type for each part will be decided and written on the Phase Document and the Summary of the Operation. These 2 documents are in the form that suitable to be used in reality effectively. Not only the manufacturing procedure, we also indicate the proper cutting condition and the calculations of cycle time, cutting force, machine power and the quality verification for each part. The data obtained by the calculation will be used to choose the specific model of machines, the amounts of machines and workers required to achieve the expected production. After we have the clear image of the production line, we shall advance to the economic study. The economic study is a good and reliable tool to indicate the profitability of the business.

40|$|We modeled the {{geometrical}} roughening of bedding-parallel, mainly layer-dominated stylolites {{in order}} to understand their structural evolution, to present an advanced classification of stylolite shapes and to relate this classification to chemical compaction and permeability variations at stylolites. Stylolites are rough dissolution seams that develop in sedimentary basins during chemical compaction. In the Zechstein 2 carbonate units, an important lean gas reservoir in the southern Permian Zechstein basin in Germany, stylolites influence local fluid flow, mineral replacement reactions and hence the permeability of the reservoir. Our simulations demonstrate that layer-dominated stylolites can grow in three distinct stages: an initial slow nucleation phase, a fast layer-pinning phase and a final freezing phase if the layer is completely dissolved during growth. Dissolution of the pinning layer and thus destruction of the stylolite's compaction tracking capabilities {{is a function of the}} background noise in the rock and the dissolution rate of the layer itself. Low background noise needs a slower dissolving layer for pinning to be successful but produces flatter teeth than higher background noise. We present an advanced classification based on our simulations and separate stylolites into four classes: (1) rectangular layer type, (2) seismogram pinning type, (3) suture/sharp peak type and (4) simple wave-like type. Rectangular layer type stylolites are the most appropriate for chemical compaction estimates because they grow linearly and record most of the actual compaction (up to 40 mm in the Zechstein example). Seismogram pinning type stylolites also provide good tracking capabilities, with the largest teeth tracking most of the compaction. Suture/sharp peak type stylolites grow in a non-linear fashion and thus do not record most of the actual compaction. However, when a non-linear growth law is used, the compaction estimates are similar to those making use of the rectangular layer type stylolites. Simple wave-like stylolites are not useful for compaction estimates, since their growth is highly non-linear with a very low growth exponent. In the case where sealing material is collected at the tooth during dissolution, stylolites can act as barriers for local fluid flow as they intensify <b>sealing</b> capabilities of <b>pinning</b> layers. However, the development of teeth and spikes offsets and thus destroys continuous stylolite seams so that the permeability across the stylolite becomes very heterogeneous and they are no continuous barriers. This behavior is best shown in rectangular layer and seismogram pinning type stylolites that develop efficient fluid barriers at teeth tips but destroy sealing capabilities of layers by offsetting them at the flank, leading to a permeability anisotropy along 2 -D stylolite planes. Suture/sharp peak stylolites can create fluid barriers if they collect enough sealing material. However, if the collecting material does not seal or if spikes offset the sealing material the stylolite leaks. We propose that our classification can be used to realistically estimate chemical compaction in reservoirs and gives an indication on how heterogeneous the permeability of stylolites can be...|$|R
