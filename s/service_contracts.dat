40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to assess the transition from traditional <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> to performance-based <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> at Department of Defense Field Contracting Activities. There {{has been an increase}} in spending on services over the past decade that has forced the Federal Government to review its policy on <b>service</b> <b>contracting.</b> In 1991, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy established policy for the acquisition of <b>services</b> using performance-based <b>contracting.</b> Interviews of Government contracting personnel and review of professional literature highlight barriers to performance-based <b>service</b> <b>contracting.</b> These barriers are: management of cultural change, education and training of Government and contractor personnel, adoption of best commercial practices, writing of performance-based statements of work, and the tasks involved in contract administration. This thesis makes recommendations for overcoming these barriers and provides guidance for successful implementation of performance-based <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> within the Department of Defense.

The building itself is located within the Amherstburg Navy Yard. It was used primarily as a means to administer <b>service</b> <b>contracts</b> to military members during the mid nineteenth century. The Callum House resembles the design of the Barracks found within Fort Malden; however, unlike the barracks, the Commissariat Office was designed without a verandah. The building underwent a restoration process carried out by Parks Canada in the 1980s, which refurbished much of the original exterior work done by the building's designer, Captain Philpotts of the Royal Engineers. As for the interior, the Parks Canada’s restoration team decided to preserve the original layout and design.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, {{the town}} of Derry {{negotiated}} a long-term contractual agreement with Pinkerton Academy. The contract specified the terms and conditions under which Pinkerton's services were purchased. Over the next thirty years, additional communities (Chester, Hampstead, Auburn, Londonderry and Windham) signed <b>service</b> <b>contracts</b> with the academy. In response to the increased number of public school students attending Pinkerton, new facilities were built. Due to the changing needs and interests of this larger student population, Pinkerton once again developed new courses and fields of study while maintaining its existing college preparatory programs. In 1978, the citizens of Londonderry voted to end their tuition agreements with the academy and established Londonderry High School. Students from Windham also no longer attend Pinkerton Academy and now attend Windham High School which opened in 2009.|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} of this design pattern advocates the use of traditional software refactoring techniques. The focus is on refactoring the service in smaller steps so {{that the impact of}} each step is small enough to the reversed in case such a change negatively affects the service consumers. Secondly, to ensure the <b>service</b> <b>contract</b> remains unaffected by changes in logic or implementation, the <b>service</b> <b>contract</b> must be decoupled as much as possible. This can be done by introduction of a façade component in between the <b>service</b> <b>contract</b> and the <b>service</b> logic. However, this is only possible if the <b>service</b> <b>contract</b> is physically decoupled from its implementation in the first place, which could be accomplished by the {{application of}} the Decoupled Contract design pattern. This could further be strengthened by the application of the Contract Centralization design pattern that advocates establishing <b>service’s</b> <b>contract</b> as the only official entry point into the service.|$|R

This thesis critically analyzes the DoD <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> process with a focus on innovation through alpha contracting as a redesign enabler. <b>Service</b> <b>contracting</b> is increasingly important as the DOD shifts to contractor support with the many unique characteristics requiring special attention that <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> entails. Data gathered from field research and interviews are employed to support comparative process analysis of eight <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> process flows. Innovation analysis of these eight processes is employed to redesign the <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> process through alpha contracting. Both positive implications and potential inhibitors to alpha contracting are discussed, as well as mechanisms to overcome the inhibitors. To generalize the results of this research, a decision model is developed to assist acquisition managers in assessing the likelihood of alpha contracting success. The thesis concludes that alpha contracting can innovate the <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> process and offers suggestions for future research along these lines.

25|$|At the {{national}} level, policy-making was fragmented between the Ministry of Energy and Water {{in charge of}} drinking water supply and the Ministry of Interior in charge of sanitation, {{as well as other}} stakeholders such as the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Environment. The donors thus pressed for a sector reform that would create commercially oriented regional water and sanitation companies that would achieve economies of scale. In 2000 a new water law was passed that created four Regional Water Establishments. However, the transfer of actual responsibilities to them remained slow and the water authorities continued to remain in charge of operating infrastructure. The Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR) also remained in charge of procuring works and consulting contracts, including <b>service</b> <b>contracts</b> to operate infrastructure despite the responsibilities bestowed on the new Establishments under the Water Law.|$|E

In 1986, Cuba had 219 doctors per 100,000 people (compared with 423.7 doctors in the Soviet Union, which had the most doctors among industrialized countries).
