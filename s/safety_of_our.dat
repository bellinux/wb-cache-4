He also added that “the French Army is moving and in great force to our support” – in Greenhalgh’s view {{this may have been}} intended as blackmail. On 12 April Haig met with Clemenceau and told him that the BEF required massive French help to “keep the war going”. 12 April Lt-Gen John du Cane was appointed senior liaison officer between Haig and Foch, an idea broached by Wilson to Foch on 9 April. French observers were impressed by the resilience of British lower ranks, and by Plumer, but less so by other British generals.|$|E
