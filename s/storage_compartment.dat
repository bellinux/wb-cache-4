5|$|Twenty-eight days later, Xeno Auxiliary Module 047 {{lands on}} the planet to {{investigate}} the loss of contact with the team. With the base in ruins, the mission records destroyed and the scientists either murdered or missing, combat marksmen Corin (Kevin O'Shea) and Roy (Robert Pugh) abandon the search for survivors and pilot Jeff (John Segal) contacts Xeno control to request clearance to return. The final shots reveal that Sandy's children have stowed themselves away inside a <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> on board the shuttle.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds have {{a simple}} stomach that is similar in {{structure}} to terrestrial carnivores. Most species have neither a cecum nor a clear demarcation between the small and large intestines; the large intestine is comparatively short and only slightly wider than the latter. Small intestine lengths range from 8 (California sea lion) to 25 times (elephant seal) the body length. The length of the intestine may be an adaptation to frequent deep diving, as the increased volume of the digestive tract serves as an extended <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> for partially digested food during submersion. Pinnipeds {{do not have an}} appendix. As in most marine mammals, the kidneys are divided into small lobes and can effectively absorb water and filter out excess salt.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the houses}} at Gedi vary in size, their number of rooms, and their layout, the basic {{house at the}} site is a three-room structure, which usually {{contained}} a forecourt and domestic court. With the three-room layout, there was usually a long main room with two storage and sleeping quarters towards {{the back of the}} house. One of the back rooms usually had a <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> near the roof with access through a trapdoor. Latrines, usually located {{toward the back of the}} main room, were also present in many of the houses, while wells were present in the courtyards of some of the houses. One of the oldest stone houses dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found in houses constructed during the fifteenth century. The entrances of houses have a greater deal of variability in the configuration of their passageways, since many of the houses were highly concentrated and laid out to maximize the use of available space.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "center console" [...] often extends, as well, to the armrest {{between the}} driver's and passenger's seats, {{which in some}} {{vehicles}} (e.g., the Toyota RAV4) features one or more <b>storage</b> <b>compartments</b> under the armrest.|$|R
25|$|The first Grand Prix was a Catalina hardtop coupe trimmed to {{standards}} {{similar to the}} larger top-line Bonneville, with a distinctive grille and taillights. The bucket seats were upholstered in Morrokide vinyl, while nylon loop-blend carpeting covered the floor and lower door panels. The center console-mounted transmission shifter included a <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> and a tachometer. The rear bench seat included a center fold-down armrest and a speaker grille {{that could be made}} functional with the extra-cost Bi-Phonic rear speaker. Included were a padded instrument panel, deluxe steering wheel, courtesy lights, and other features.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the Type 94 {{was based on the}} British Carden-Loyd Mark VIb tankettes. The hull of the Type 94 was of riveted and welded construction, with a {{front-mounted}} engine with the driver to the right. The engine was an air-cooled petrol motor that developed 35 hp at 2,500 rpm. Like many armored vehicles intended to operate in hot conditions, the engine was given asbestos insulation to protect the occupants from its heat. The commander stood in a small (unpowered) turret {{at the rear of the}} hull. A large door in the rear of the hull accessed the <b>storage</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|E
25|$|Captured French {{armoured}} tractors. The use {{of these}} tractors by the first wave units was intended to reduce their dependence upon horses and probably would have reduced the problems of getting supplies off the beaches. In addition to their proposed use on the beaches, the Germans later used them as tractors for antitank guns and munitions carriers, as self-propelled guns, and as armoured personnel carriers. There were two main types. The Renault UE Chenillette (German name: Infanterie Schlepper UE 630 (f)) was a light tracked armoured carrier and prime mover produced by France between 1932 and 1940. Five to six thousand were built, and about 3,000 were captured and overhauled by the Germans. They had a <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> that could carry 350kg, pull a trailer weighing 775kg {{for a total of}} about 1000kg, and could climb a 50% slope. The armour was 5â€“9mm, enough to stop shell fragments and bullets. There was also the Lorraine 37L, which was larger, of which 360 fell into German hands. In that vehicle a load of 810 kilograms could be carried, plus a 690kg trailer pulled for a total of 1.5 tonnes. The use of such captured equipment meant that the first wave divisions were largely motorised, with the first wave using 9.3% (4,200) of the 45,000 horses normally required.|$|E
50|$|Increasingly, center {{consoles}} {{include a}} wide variety of <b>storage</b> <b>compartments</b> and cupholders, some of them with a refrigerator, in addition to the more traditional use as purely a surface for instrumentation (e.g., outside temperature display) and controls (car audio).|$|R
50|$|Antique lap desks had hinged writing surfaces, often {{covered in}} leather, felt, or other material, that flip up to reveal storage space for papers. Individual {{compartments}} {{were designed to}} hold inkwells, pens, sealing wax, and other contemporary writing materials. Some desks also had concealed <b>storage</b> <b>compartments.</b>|$|R
40|$|Hepatocytes take up {{a variety}} of ligands via receptor-mediated endocytosis, yet little is known {{regarding}} either the volume of fluid or the amount of membrane internalized via endocytosis in liver cells. In these studies, we have utilized radiolabeled inulin to characterize fluid phase endocytosis by rat hepatocytes in primary culture and perfused rat liver. Uptake of inulin by cultured hepatocytes was nonlinear with time, occurring most rapidly during the first 2 min. Inulin uptake and efflux in cultured hepatocytes and inulin uptake by perfused rat liver were kinetically compatible with the entry of inulin into a rapidly (t 1 / 2, 1 - 2 min) turning-over (presumably endosomal) compartment that exchanged contents with the extracellular space and comprised approximately 3 % of hepatocyte volume, as well as entry into and concentration of inulin within slowly (t 1 / 2, greater than 1 hr) turning-over <b>storage</b> <b>compartments.</b> Based on inulin uptake, {{it is estimated that}} cultured hepatocytes endocytosed the equivalent of 20 % or more of their volume and 5 or more times their plasma membrane surface area each hour. Neither chloroquine (1 mM) nor taurocholate (200 microM) affected inulin handling by cultured cells, whereas colchicine (10 microM) inhibited transfer to <b>storage</b> <b>compartments</b> by greater than 50 %. In conjunction with our previous observations, the present findings suggest that inulin endocytosed across the basolateral membrane is largely (congruent to 80 %) regurgitated back into plasma, with smaller amounts transported to intracellular <b>storage</b> <b>compartments</b> (congruent to 18 %) or to bile (congruent to 2 %). Transport of inulin via these pathways is unaffected by taurocholate and does not require vesicle acidification, whereas intact microtubular function is required for transfer to <b>storage</b> <b>compartments</b> or biliary secretion...|$|R
500|$|The {{characters}} and mecha designs {{were made by}} artist Yoji Shinkawa based on Kojima's concepts. According to Shinkawa, Solid Snake's physique in this particular installment was based on Jean-Claude Van Damme, while his facial appearance was based on Christopher Walken. The characters were completed by polygonal artists using brush drawings and clay models by Shinkawa. Kojima wanted greater interaction with objects and the environment, such as allowing the player to hide bodies in a <b>storage</b> <b>compartment.</b> Additionally, he wanted [...] "a full orchestra {{right next to the}} player"; a system which made modifications such as tempo and texture to the currently playing track, instead of switching to another pre-recorded track. Although these features could not be achieved, they were implemented in [...]|$|E
2500|$|Most flares, {{like the}} MJU-27A/B flares, {{must be kept}} in an {{airtight}} <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> before deployment. These flares, known as pyrophoric flares, are made of special materials that ignite {{when they come in}} contact with the air. This is a safety and convenience factor, since attempting to ignite a flare inside [...] the fuselage and then deploying it is risky. However pyrotechnic flares (such as the MJU-32) also exist, and offer their own safety benefit; requiring an external ignition method, an accidental leak or puncture in the <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> would not result in a catastrophic fire on board the aircraft as with a pyrophoric flare.|$|E

40|$|Species of the heteropteran {{subfamily}} Lygaeinae possess special subcuticular compartments {{to store}} cardiac glycosides, plant-derived defensive compounds, which they release upon predator attack. In adults {{of the large}} milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus, these <b>storage</b> <b>compartments</b> have previously {{been described as a}} modified integument, forming a fluid-filled dorsolateral space. Here we use three-dimensional imaging of serial histological sections and synchrotron radiation-based micro-computed tomography data to reveal the morphology of these <b>storage</b> <b>compartments</b> and the mechanisms used for the release of a cardiac glycoside-rich fluid upon attack. Our comparative analysis revealed that the morphology and release mechanism vary among the species investigated. By reconstructing these traits on a recent molecular phylogeny of the Lygaeinae, we demonstrate that the adaptations for the storage and release of cardiac glycosides have evolved in a stepwise manner...|$|R

5000|$|Stock: A {{variety of}} M4 {{retractable}} buttstocks are {{used on a}} standard 4-position receiver extension, including the standard [...] "CAR" [...] stock. Most often seen is the SOPMOD stock, {{often referred to as}} the [...] "Crane stock", created by Dave Armstrong of NSWC-Crane. The angled stock offers better cheekweld as well as providing two <b>storage</b> <b>compartments</b> for spare batteries. The stock must be removed from the weapon to access the <b>storage</b> <b>compartments.</b> The initial run of stocks was made by NSWC-Crane from glass fiber polymer. Because of this, they were somewhat fragile and did not always properly lock into the receiver extension. A rubber band was used to secure the latch so it would not slide out of the desired position. The current L7LA2B SOPMOD stocks are made by Lewis Machine & Tools and have none of these problems.|$|R
