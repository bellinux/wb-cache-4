60|$|The man still <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> He asks if {{he shall}} find some one to carry my bag. I decline to let anybody be disturbed. He {{inquires}} if I have any messages {{to leave for}} my friend. I inform him that I have left written messages upstairs for Sir James and the landlord. Upon this he draws the bolts and opens the door. To the last {{he looks at me}} as if he thought I was mad.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is as {{like her}} mother as possible," [...] he mused, {{as soon as he}} was clear of the house. [...] "It might have been Hilda herself, only she is twice as {{beautiful}} as Hilda was. I shall have another bad night after this, I know I shall. I must get rid of that girl somehow, I cannot bear her about me; she is a daily reminder of things I dare not remember, and whenever she <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with those great eyes of hers, I feel as though she were looking through me. I wonder if she knows the story of Maria Lee!" ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{they all}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{and then they}} all <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> the ship lying at anchor.|$|R
60|$|It was the general-in-chief. He <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{but said}} nothing.|$|R
60|$|George Mackintosh <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Then a crimson blush mantled his face.|$|R
6000|$|Thus, {{when reading}} in my deck chair or when talking with others, {{practically}} {{any mention of}} {{any part of the}} world I knew instantly aroused the connotation of drinking and good fellows. Big nights and days and moments, all purple passages and freedoms, thronged my memory. [...] "Venice" [...] <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from the printed page, and I remember the cafe tables on the sidewalks. [...] "The Battle of Santiago," [...] some one says, and I answer, [...] "Yes, I've been over the ground." [...] But I do not see the ground, nor Kettle Hill, nor the Peace Tree. What I see is the Cafe Venus, on the plaza of Santiago, where one hot night I drank and talked with a dying consumptive.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Shame on {{your parents}} {{that they should}} have reared you with so slight a {{knowledge}} o' the King's English!' grumbled Solomon. 'In truth, friend, it is a marvel to me why sailor men should be able to show a lead to those on shore in the matter of lingo. For out of seven hundred men in the ship Worcester--the same that sank in the Bay of Funchal--there was {{not so much as a}} powder-boy but could understand every word that I said, whereas on shore there is many a great jolterhead, like thyself, who might be a Portugee for all the English that he knows, and who <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like a pig in a hurricane if I do lint ask him what he makes the reckoning, or how many bells have gone.' ...|$|E
6000|$|But will a {{male child}} {{do as much}} for his father? This remains to be seen, and so, after waiting several months, I decided to buy David a rocking-horse. My St. Bernard dog {{accompanied}} me, though I have always been diffident of taking him to toy-shops, which over-excite him. Hitherto the toys I had bought had always been for him, and as we durst not admit this to the saleswoman we were both horribly self-conscious when in the shop. A score of times I have {{told him that he}} had much better not come, I have announced fiercely that he is not to come. He then lets go of his legs, which is how a St. Bernard sits down, making the noise of a sack of coals suddenly deposited, and, laying his head between his front paws, <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> through the red haws that make his eyes so mournful. He will do this for an hour without blinking, for he knows that in time it will unman me. My dog knows very little, but what little he does know he knows extraordinarily well. One can get out of my chambers by a back way, and I sometimes steal softly--but I can't help looking back, and there he is, and there are those haws asking sorrowfully, [...] "Is this worthy of you?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{stopped and}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> It {{was like being}} at an aquarium.|$|R
60|$|The doctor <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> 'I don't {{know what}} you mean,' he said.|$|R
60|$|He <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with {{a hopeless}} {{expression}} upon his vacuous, good-natured, scrubby little face.|$|R
6000|$|So this is Dimchurch! I {{shake out}} the chalk-dust from the skirts of my dress. I long (quite vainly) {{for the least}} bit of looking-glass to see myself in. Here is the {{population}} (to the number of at least five or six), gathered together, informed by the scouts--and it is my woman's business to produce the best impression of myself that I can. We advance along the little road. I smile upon the population. The population <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in return. On one side, I remark three or four cottages, {{and a bit of}} open ground; also an inn named [...] "The Cross-Hands," [...] and a bit more of open ground; also a tiny, tiny butcher's shop, with sanguinary insides of sheep on one blue pie-dish in the window, and no other meat than that, and nothing to see beyond, but again the open ground, and again the hills; indicating the end of the village this side. On the other side there appears, for some distance, nothing but a long flint wall guarding the outhouses of a farm. Beyond this, comes another little group of cottages, with the seal of civilization set on them, {{in the form of a}} post-office. The post-office deals in general commodities--in boots and bacon, biscuits and flannel, crinoline petticoats and religious tracts. Farther on, behold another flint wall, a garden, and a private dwelling-house; proclaiming itself as the rectory. Farther yet, on rising ground, a little desolate church, with a tiny white circular steeple, topped by an extinguisher in red tiles. Beyond this, the hills and the heavens once more. And there is Dimchurch! ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{stand at}} the street corner, I don't see {{as many as four}} people at once going to church, though I see as many as four churches with their {{steeples}} clamouring for people. I choose my church, and go up the flight of steps to the great entrance in the tower. A mouldy tower within, and like a neglected washhouse. A rope comes through the beamed roof, and a man in the corner pulls it and clashes the bell--a whity-brown man, whose clothes were once black- -a man with flue on him, and cobweb. He <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> wondering how I come there, and I stare at him, wondering how he comes there. Through a screen of wood and glass, I peep into the dim church. About twenty people are discernible, waiting to begin. Christening would seem to have faded out of this church long ago, for the font has the dust of desuetude thick upon it, and its wooden cover (shaped like an old-fashioned tureen-cover) looks as if it wouldn't come off, upon requirement. I perceive the altar to be rickety and the Commandments damp. Entering after this survey, I jostle the clergyman in his canonicals, who is entering too from a dark lane behind a pew of state with curtains, where nobody sits. The pew is ornamented with four blue wands, once carried by four somebodys, I suppose, before somebody else, but which there is nobody now to hold or receive honour from. I open the door of a family pew, and shut myself in; if I could occupy twenty family pews at once I might have them. The clerk, a brisk young man (how does HE come here?), glances at me knowingly, as who should say, 'You have done it now; you must stop.' Organ plays. Organ-loft is in a small gallery across the church; gallery congregation, two girls. I wonder within myself what will happen when we are required to sing.|$|E
40|$|Nicky is {{standing}} over {{there by the}} edge of the field looking at something. He 2 ̆ 7 s the one that killed Caspar. He and his friend Rocco. We can 2 ̆ 7 t prove it though, since no one actually saw them, and we never found Caspar 2 ̆ 7 s body. He doesn’t notice me right away, then he does, and I watch the way his body suddenly goes on alert. He <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for a moment, and even though he 2 ̆ 7 s still fifty feet away, I can see his eyes. He starts coming toward me, and I stop where I am on the gravel road to see what he will do. As he gets closer, he slows his pace and starts crouching down, his eyes still fixed on me. It 2 ̆ 7 s as if he 2 ̆ 7 s in slow motion, one leg slowly going out in front of the other. By the time he reaches me his stomach is practically scraping the ground, and his ears are pulled back. It 2 ̆ 7 s what they do if they think you 2 ̆ 7 re more powerful than they are and they don 2 ̆ 7 t want a fight...|$|E
60|$|He <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> stupidly for a moment. Then {{he laughed}} in a silly, {{crackling}} fashion.|$|R
60|$|Now Umslopogaas {{started as}} one starts who is wounded by a spear, and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|Captain Seccombe <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and I <b>at</b> Captain Seccombe. Reuben Colenso stood {{wringing}} his cap.|$|R
40|$|I 2 ̆ 7 ve dashed into {{a coffee}} shop and ordered my {{take-away}} flat white. While waiting I observe {{a group of three}} mothers sitting outdoors with prams carefully arranged not to obstruct the flow of customers, enjoying a coffee and chat with babes in arms. One mum is patiently wrestling with her about 1 -month old baby trying to latch him to breastfeed, while the others watch sympathetically, offering support and advice. 2 ̆ 7 He always fusses like this. Sometimes it takes 5 minutes to get him on and by then he 2 ̆ 7 s lost the plot. Being somewhere different seems to make him worse 2 ̆ 7. 2 ̆ 7 Have you had him checked for tongue-tie? 2 ̆ 7 one mother asks knowingly. I listen in, deliberately eavesdropping now. 2 ̆ 7 Yes, the Child Health Nurse had a look but said his mouth is quite normal and the fussing is just his impatience to get the food 2 ̆ 7. She popped a dummy in the baby 2 ̆ 7 s mouth and he calmed down temporarily. My coffee is ready and I sit down for a few sips. 2 ̆ 7 My friend 2 ̆ 7 s baby needed a release for a tongue-tie which many health professionals missed but the chiropractor found. Maybe you should take him to a chiropractor? 2 ̆ 7 The baby squawks spitting out the dummy, and the mother firmly lays his flailing arms across his chest trying valiantly to latch him again. At this point I cannot resist getting involved too, my heart is pounding as I introduce myself as an international board certified lactation consultant (IBCLC) 2 ̆ 7 Gosh you 2 ̆ 7 re having a battle there. can I offer a suggestion? 2 ̆ 7 All three pairs of eyes look astonished at my bold intervention, but she gladly agrees 2 ̆ 7 Yes, whatever can help 2 ̆ 7. I verbally guide her to position her baby differently - his hip towards her hip, arms either side of her breast, his chest snuggling in contact with her own and holding him only over his shoulders allowing his head to fall back. She resists allowing his head to be free but complies as his chin rests at the base of her areola. Baby gapes widely and spontaneously latches as my hand supports her hand on his shoulders to maintain a secure hold. The expression on her face tells me she is greatly relieved. 2 ̆ 7 It doesn 2 ̆ 7 t hurt, 2 ̆ 7 she says with a look of disbelief as she <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> smiling. 2 ̆ 7 Great, remember what you and your baby have just done. Keep going. You are doing a fantastic job! 2 ̆ 7...|$|E
60|$|He {{continued}} to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Then a sudden flash of intelligence lit up his features.|$|R
60|$|He <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{for a long}} moment, {{speechless}} in his utter amazement. Then {{he swallowed}} hard.|$|R
60|$|He <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> speechlessly for a moment, and then, out {{of sheer}} impotency, turned to go.|$|R
60|$|He <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I {{suppose the}} question, {{led up to}} by no {{previous}} remark, was unusual.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for some moments. I found myself able to endure his scrutiny.|$|R
60|$|I <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Gip, and Gip <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{and there}} were our distortions in the magic mirrors, looking very rum, and grave, and quiet...|$|R
60|$|He <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{without the}} {{slightest}} movement. I held his eyes with mine. I spoke very slowly.|$|R
60|$|He thought, {{his hands}} hanging over his knees. He {{peered through the}} glass and then <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|His {{whole face}} {{suddenly}} became alive, {{and for the}} first time he stood erect and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|My lady <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> as if I knew. And I didn't know. And that perplexed me afresh.|$|R
60|$|GLORIA. So it {{has come}} to this, that you follow me about in public to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|The two women, who {{had risen}} from their knees, <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as though they saw a ghost.|$|R
60|$|The Judge <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> aghast. It was {{the first}} time I had dared oppose him on this subject.|$|R
60|$|Umslopogaas <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{and laying}} his hand upon the great axe, half rose. Then {{he sat down}} again.|$|R
60|$|He <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> piteously. The noble sentiments which I had {{inherited}} from Doctor Pratolungo, completely bewildered Mr. Oscar Dubourg.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Hans awoke, {{and sitting}} up, <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> through the bright flame which I had {{recently}} fed with dry wood.|$|R
60|$|Stroeve {{was silent}} again, and he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{with his mouth}} open and his round blue eyes {{starting}} out of his head.|$|R
