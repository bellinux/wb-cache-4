5|$|After {{the success}} of Uyarndha Manithan, AVM Productions was keen to remake it in Hindi and {{approached}} Dilip Kumar. After watching the film, Kumar was hesitant to play the lead role as he felt he would not match Ganesan's performance in the original version. K. Balachander was <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> be {{the director of the}} remake, which led to Kumar being initially convinced that he could be successful.|$|E

5|$|There was {{no formal}} legal basis under which a citizen could emigrate from East Germany. In 1975, however, East Germany <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Helsinki Accords, a pan-European treaty to improve {{relations}} between the countries of Europe. An increasing number of East German citizens sought to use the Accords' provision on freedom of movement to secure exit visas. By the late 1980s, over 100,000applications for visas were being submitted annually with around 15,000–25,000being granted.|$|E

5|$|Like his {{political}} career, Kogălniceanu's tracts focused on condemning Austrian ethnic and territorial policies. Also in 1875, he issued from Paris an anti-Austrian brochure about the Romanian cause in Bukovina. Called Rapt de la Bukovine d'après les documents authentiques ("The Rape of Bukovina, from Genuine Documents"), it reused old texts {{collected by the}} Hurmuzachis. The propaganda effort won support from across the floor: Junimea Conservatives (Titu Maiorescu, Theodor Rosetti, Ioan Slavici), National Liberals (D. Sturdza) and independents (Alexandru Odobescu) all <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the enterprise.|$|E

5|$|In April 1993, Sega {{announced}} the Sega Channel service, which would utilize cable television services to deliver content. National {{testing in the}} United States for the service began in June, and deployment across the United States began in December, with a complete U.S. release in 1994. By June 1994, Sega Channel had gained a total of 21 cable companies <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> carry the service. Fees in the United States for the service varied depending on location, but were approximately US$15 monthly, plus a $25 activation fee, which included the adapter. The Sega Channel expanded into Canada in late 1995, with an approximately Can$19 monthly fee. During the planning stages of the service, Sega looked {{to capitalize on the}} rental market, which had seen some success with the Sega CD being rented through Blockbuster, Inc., and was looking to base the service's offering of games and demos to help sell more cartridges.|$|E

5|$|Jagielski <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Polish Workers' Party (PPR) in 1944, or in 1946 (sources vary). When the Polish Worker's Party {{transformed}} into the Polish United Workers Party (PZPR) in 1948, he {{became a member of}} the new party. From 1946 to 1949, Jagielski served on the Central Board of the Związek Samopomocy Chłopskiej (Association of Peasant Self-Help), a communist organization designed to take control of the countryside. From 1950 to 1952 he was on the Central Board of the State Agricultural Farms and from December 1952 to December 1953 he was a deputy director of that institution. In December 1953, he became the Director of the Agricultural Department of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers Party, a position he would hold until December 1956.|$|E
5|$|Macartney scored 2,207 runs {{during the}} tour {{at an average}} of 45.04. During the English season, he reached the peak of his {{performance}} as an all-rounder, taking 38 wickets. He made six centuries, including two in one match against Sussex. Apart from his 99 at Lord's, Macartney did not pass 34 in the other Tests and ended with 197 runs at 32.83. He did not bowl heavily during the series, taking six wickets at 23.66. It was not a happy tour for the Australians; without the senior players, there were frequent reports of drunken brawls and verbal abuse towards the locals. Macartney was one of only four players to accept the guaranteed tour fee of 400 pounds; the others <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a percentage share of the profits and the commercial failure of the tour left them with {{less than half of the}} flat fee.|$|E
5|$|Of the 56 riders that <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{participate}} in the 1912 Giro d'Italia, 54 of them began the race on 19 May. Since the race's general classification was to be based around team points there were no independent riders as in years past. The organizers allowed the participating teams to have up to four riders, with each team needing three riders to finish each stage {{to remain in the}} race. There were a total of fourteen teams that started the 1912 Giro d'Italia. A French team was planning on competing in the race, but opted not to and so all the teams that competed were based in Italy. This edition of the Giro d'Italia saw the first teams enter the race that were not sponsored by a bicycle related industry.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} Royal Mail's {{modernisation}} drive involved {{the introduction of the}} walk sequencing machine that organises mail into the order the postman will deliver them on his round. The union feared that a national introduction of this equipment would lead to thousands of full-time workers being made redundant and {{a significant increase in the}} number of part-time staff. The Communication Workers Union argued that although it had <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> this part of the agreement in 2007 and that the plans would make it necessary for some jobs to be lost, it had not understood the exact nature of Royal Mail's plan. Furthermore, the union said that when Royal Mail stopped talking to staff about the long-term effects of job security, there had been no choice other than to threaten a strike to restart discussions. Royal Mail, on the other hand, said that it had not stopped talking to the union and continued to involve it in its modernisation strategy.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{also decided}} to join the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), an occult {{organisation}} whose British branch, the Mysteria Magica Maxima (MMM), was run by Crowley, who used it to promote Thelema. In January 1915, Smith <b>signed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the MMM, and in April went through the Minerval degree initiation at the British Columbia Lodge No. 1. In May, he {{took part in the}} Lodge's public performance of the Rites of Isis, which it was hoped would attract further members. In a private capacity, he meanwhile continued performing his A∴A∴ practices, and also began experimenting with the entheogenic properties of anhalonium. In October 1915, Crowley visited the Lodge, where he met with Smith. Soon after, Smith would be upgraded to the position of Master Magician within the Lodge, and in March 1916 received the Probationer level in the A∴A∴, adopting as his personal magical motto the Latin words Nubem Eripiam ("I will snatch away the cloud").|$|E
