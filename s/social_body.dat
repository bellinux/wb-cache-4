25|$|According to {{historian}} Stephen Barnes, {{there exist}} four major {{ways of looking}} at the origins and functions of the Gulag. The first approach was championed by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and is what Barnes terms the 'moral explanation'. According to this view, Soviet ideology eliminated the moral checks on the darker side of human nature - providing convenient justifications for violence and evil-doing on all levels: from political decision-making to personal relations. Another approach is the 'political explanation', according to which the Gulag (along with executions) was primarily a means for eliminating the regime's perceived political enemies (this understanding is favored, among others, by historian Robert Conquest). The 'economic explanation', in turn as set out by historian Anne Applebaum, argues that the Soviet regime instrumentalized the Gulag for its economic development projects. Although never economically profitable, it was perceived as such right up to Stalin's death in 1953. Finally, Barnes advances his own, fourth explanation, which situates the Gulag in the context of modern projects of 'cleansing' the <b>social</b> <b>body</b> of hostile elements, through spatial isolation and physical elimination of individuals defined as harmful.|$|E

The objective of the bachelor thesis is to ascertain {{the current level of}} electronic communication between <b>social</b> security <b>bodies</b> and their clients. The attention is given to correct utilization of individual electronic services by the clients. The theoretical part characterizes the electronic services provided by <b>social</b> security <b>bodies</b> and thier embodiment in legal regulations. It also describes the terms most frequently used in the concerned issue. On the basis of the content analysis of the statistical data, the practical part analyses the obtained data and draws attention to the strengths and the weaknesses of the electronic services provided, with regard to {{the current state of the}} information and computer literacy of clients of <b>social</b> security <b>bodies.</b> Using common examples from practice, the basic procedures of establishing and using electronic services are described. The thesis is concluded with the results specifying certain problematic issues that may discourage a client establishing electronic communication with <b>social</b> security <b>bodies</b> from its further use. The thesis also points out to the diverse degrees of utilization of individual electronic services provided by <b>social</b> security <b>bodies...</b>|$|R

40|$|The ethnographic {{core of this}} {{dissertation}} {{is comprised}} of the body stories of American acupuncturists and their clients. I posit a notion of embodiment based on "feeling the qi. " A unique bodily sensation during acupuncture treatments, "feeling the qi" also opens up the relationship between embodiment and storytelling. This is a paradigm of embodiment that is enacted {{in a process of}} disclosure and requires a revision of the notion of appropriation. The four central chapters are structured in terms of four relational <b>bodies</b> of appropriation: <b>social</b> <b>bodies</b> of translation, technocratic bodies, mediating bodies, and emergent bodies. I open with <b>social</b> <b>bodies</b> as the discursive realm of making sense of bodily being, in that <b>social</b> <b>bodies</b> trace the "translating channels" through which acupuncture is culturally translated into American contexts. Technocratic bodies exert control and act as general gatekeepers in biomedicine's encounters with acupuncture. Acupuncture practitioners are mediating <b>bodies</b> within the <b>social</b> realm in which practitioners, clients, technocracies, and emergent bodies all encounter one another. Emergent bodies in the stories of individual clients of acupuncture evoke thematics of gender, care, partnership, and bodily recovery. This dance of translative, technocratic, mediating, and emergent bodies revises conventional abstractions of "the body" as a metaphor. "Feeling the qi," initiates a movement in this dissertation through these four storied and relational bodies of appropriation, closing with an analysis of issues of positioning and reflexivity...|$|R

Indeed, above the labouring class, the number of individuals in the <b>social</b> <b>body</b> whose gross income is entirely the result of their social activities is very small. Previously in the world's history, saving a few quite exceptional aspects, the possession and retention of property was conditional upon activities of some sort, honest or dishonest, work, force, or fraud. But the shareholding ingredient of our new society, so far as its shareholding goes, has no need of strength or wisdom; the countless untraceable Owner of the modern world presents in a multitudinous form the image of a Merovingian king. The shareholder owns the world de jure, by the common recognition of the rights of property; and the incumbency of knowledge, management, and toil fall entirely to others. He toils not, neither does he spin; he is mechanically released from the penalty of the Fall, he reaps in a still sinful world all the practical benefits of a millennium--without any of its moral limitations.|$|E
