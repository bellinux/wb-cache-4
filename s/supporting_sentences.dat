This observational research is conducted to answer how a writer can apply principles of quoting and paraphrasing to a paragraph of five sentences, and these principles prevent the students of Writing 1 from inadvertent plagiarism. Qualitatively, the 43 -writing students’ work were classified into a coherent paragraf from writing a topic sentence to a concluding one, and then analysed each sentence {{in the application of}} quoting and paraphrasing principles as the essential pillars of paragraph building. As a result, most students tend to summarise their most major and minor <b>supporting</b> <b>sentences</b> significantly to support their topic sentence, instead of quoting and paraphrasing their <b>supporting</b> <b>sentences</b> completely and finally using their concluding sentence as a restatement of their topic sentence...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{recursive}} neural network (RNN) to extract answers to arbitrary natural language questions from <b>supporting</b> <b>sentences,</b> by training on a crowdsourced data set (to be released upon presentation). The RNN defines feature representations at every node of the parse trees {{of questions and}} <b>supporting</b> <b>sentences,</b> when applied recursively, starting with token vectors from a neural probabilistic language model. In contrast to prior work, we fix neither the types of the questions nor the forms of the answers; the system classifies tokens to match a substring chosen by the question’s author. Our classifier decides to follow each parse tree node of a support sentence or not, by classifying its RNN embedding together with those of its siblings and the root node of the question, until reaching the tokens it selects as the answer. A novel co-training task for the RNN, on subtree recognition, boosts performance, along with a scheme to consistently handle words that are not well-represented in the language model. On our data set, we surpass an open source system epitomizing a classic “pattern bootstrapping ” approach to question answering. ...|$|E
40|$|Latent {{relational}} search (LRS) {{is a novel}} {{approach for}} mapping knowledge across two domains. Given a source domain knowledge concerning the Moon, “The Moon is a satellite of the Earth”, one can form a question {(Moon, Earth), (Ganymede,?) } to query an LRS engine for new knowledge in the target domain concerning the Ganymede. An LRS engine relies on some <b>supporting</b> <b>sentences</b> such as “Ganymede is a natural satellite of Jupiter. ” to retrieve and rank “Jupiter ” as the first answer. This paper proposes cross-language latent relational search (CLRS) to extend the knowledge mapping capability of LRS from cross-domain knowledge mapping to cross-domain and cross-language knowledge mapping. In CLRS, the <b>supporting</b> <b>sentences</b> for the source pair {{might be in a}} different language with that of the target pair. We represent the relation between two entities in an entity pair by lexical patterns of the context surrounding the two entities. We then propose a novel hybrid lexical pattern clustering algorithm to capture the semantic similarity between paraphrased lexical patterns across languages. Experiments on Japanese-English datasets show that the proposed method achieves an MRR of 0. 579 for CLRS task, which is comparable to the MRR of an existing monolingual LRS engine...|$|E

In this paper we give the first formalization of the problem, how it can be evaluated, and present a full evaluation dataset. We propose several methods to rank these sentences, namely retrieval-based, entity-ranking based and position-based. We found that traditional bag-of-words models perform relatively well when there is a match between an entity and a query in a given sentence, but they fail to find a <b>support</b> <b>sentence</b> for a substantial portion of entities. This can be improved by in-corporating small windows of context sentences and ranking them appropriately...|$|R

This study also aims at finding {{out whether or not}} the paragraphs reach completeness through the MASS and MISS. The type of this study is descriptive qualitative research. The object of the study was expository paragraphs written by the third semester students of the English Education Department of the University of PGRI Semarang in the academic year 2013 / 2014. Documentation was used to collect the data; it was the teacher candidate students‘ writing result. In analyzing the data, there were three steps done, namely data reduction, data display, and drawing conclusion. The result of the study shows that The MASS and the MISS had been used well by the 10 teacher candidate students or 40 % in developing expository paragraphs, and the completeness was reachable. There were 6 paragraphs or 24 % which were categorized half complete; it means the MASS and the MISS had been less appropriately applied. The last categorization found in the paragraphs was incomplete. There were 9 paragraphs or 36 % belong in this categorization.

Memory networks reason with inference components combined with a long-term memory component; they learn how to use these jointly. The long-term memory can be read and written to, with the goal of using it for prediction. We investigate these models in the context of question answering (QA) where the long-term memory effectively acts as a (dynamic) knowledge base, and the output is a textual response. We evaluate them on a large-scale QA task, and a smaller, but more complex, toy task generated from a simulated world. In the latter, we show the reasoning power of such models by chaining multiple <b>supporting</b> <b>sentences</b> to answer questions that require understanding the intension of verbs...|$|E

40|$|Good {{composition}} {{is the one}} which creates clear impression of unity (Vivian and Jackson, 1961 : 32). In addition, a good composition must be unified on two levels. First, it must have an overall unity that means each paragraph of the composition must {{be related to the}} thesis statement as the central idea which is stated in the introductory paragraph. Second, the individual support paragraphs (paragraph 2, paragraph 3, and so on) must also exhibit internal unity. It means that the <b>supporting</b> <b>sentences</b> of each paragraph must be related to its topic sentence. This study is intended to reveal how far the third semester English Department students of Widya Mandala Catholic University can apply their knowledge in writing unified compositions. As they learn descriptive writing, the writer analyzes the unity as encountered in their descriptive compositions. The analysis covered the analysis of unity in the paragraph and unity in the whole composition. To carry out this study, the writer took the third semester English Department students of Widya Mandala University as the subjects of this study. The data were taken from their final test papers. As stated previously, the analysis of the data covered the analysis of unity in the paragraph and unity in the whole composition. To analyze the unity in the paragraph, the writer identified the topic sentence of each paragraph and evaluated the relationship between the <b>supporting</b> <b>sentences</b> and its topic sentence while to analyze the unity in the whole composition, the writer identified the thesis statement of each composition and evaluated the relationship between each topic sentence and its thesis statement. The analysis of unity in the paragraph showed that most paragraphs under study were disunified while the rest were unified. There were two factors that violated the unity in those paragraphs. They are the presence of more than one topic sentence and the irrelevant relationship between some <b>supporting</b> <b>sentences</b> and the topic sentence. In addition, the analysis of the unity in the whole composition showed that all compositions under study were disunified. There were also some factors that made all compositions under study disunified. They are the absence of thesis statement as the central idea of the composition, the disunity in one or some or all paragraphs of the compositions, and finally, the irrelevant relationship between one or two topic sentences and the thesis statement. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that all students under study still found difficulties in creating unity in their compositions especially in writing composition with one thesis statement, in making all paragraphs of the composition unfied, and developing the thesis statement in several paragraphs which support the thesis statement itself. Concerning the result of this study, it is suggested that the teachers should train the students in forming thesis statements as the central idea of a composition as well as elaborate it into several topic sentences by making an outline of a composition. It is also suggested that the teachers should keep training the students to create unity in the paragraph since one or two or all paragraphs are disunfied in all students’ compositions under study...|$|E

Through studying topic sentences in Chinese students’ English essays, this research aims to find out the frequency and the placement of topic sentences, the wording within topic sentences and the relationship between topic sentences and paragraph unity. In this research, 45 English essays written by Chinese students were collected from WECCL corpus and targeted topic sentences were selected out afterwards. Depending on Wordsmith 3. 0, results related to topic sentences were generated including the frequency, the placement, the wording of topic sentences and the unity between topic sentences and <b>supporting</b> <b>sentences.</b> Results show that Chinese students have a good awareness of writing topic sentences and placing them at the beginning of paragraphs. However, Chinese students are not good at applying transitional phrases and expressing ideas objectively as academic writing requires. Moreover, paragraph unity in some Chinese students’ essays is poor. In addition, as a part of this empirical study, an interview about how to write topic sentences was conducted among ten Chinese students majoring in English in order to verify the results.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the theoretical concept of English paragraph {{as opposed to}} its ambiguity in practice. As for the definition of what an ideal paragraph is, there is fairly general agreement {{that it is a}} group of several related sentences that develops one main idea and also that it is usually composed of a topic sentence, <b>supporting</b> <b>sentences,</b> and a concluding sentence. The clarity of the concept, however, seems very doubtful and obscure when various English pafagraphs are analyzed in view of their length and composite parts. Of the 201 expository paragraphs taken from fourteen texts representing newspapers, weekly and monthly magazines, and English textbooks for Japanese EFL learners, only 23 paragraphs are judged as ideal from the viewpoint of length, i. e. the number of sentences contained in each paragraph. Most paragraphs examined in this study are short and judged as exceptional in light of the ideal concept of the English paragraph. Furthermore, qualitative analysis of the 23 ideal examples shows that no concluding sentences are clearly stated in the paragraphs, although many of them contain a topic sentence in various positions. These findings clearly contradict the concept of the ideal Enghsh paragraph and show the great gap between theory and practice. The concept of the English paragraph seems very clear in theory but becomes very obscure if considered practically. This suggests the difficulties we may have in teaching the concept of the English paragraph. In response to this, this paper briefly discusses how to teach paragraph writing／reading in Japanese EFL settings, because teaching the concept of English paragraph is very important for academic essay writing／reading...|$|E

To aid in interpreting the SAT data, we present a formal model of the antecedent retrieval process, and derive quantitative predictions about the time course of antecedent retrieval. The modeling results support the Local Search hypothesis: during syntactic retrieval, comprehenders initially limit memory search to the local syntactic domain. We argue that Local Search hypothesis has important implications for theories of locality effects in sentence comprehension. In particular, ou...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Paragraphs are the {{building}} blocks of essays. A sound knowledge of paragraph structuring leads to well-written and readable essays. On the contrary, a lack of paragraph writing skills culminates into a farrago of ideas scattered haphazardly in the essay, thereby affecting paragraph unity and coherence, which in turn impacts negatively on the packaging of ideas in the essay. This study has been prompted by my observation over the years of paragraph construction difficulties polytechnic students face in their academic writing, and also the paucity of research in polytechnic writing. As a result, this paper set to investigate how students structure their paragraphs in terms of topic <b>sentence</b> use and <b>support</b> <b>sentences.</b> A corpus of 120 essays was collected from four departments in Kumasi Polytechnic, Kumasi, Ghana and using Bain’s paragraph principles as a benchmark to analyse them, the results revealed that 66 % of the essays employed definite paragraph format. The study also found numerous one-sentence paragraphs leading to the creation of indentations, with reckless abandon.
