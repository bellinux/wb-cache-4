40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the growth of green algae Chlorella sp. on wastewaters sampled from four different points of the treatment process flow of a local municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) and how well the algal growth removed nitrogen, phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and metal ions from the wastewaters. The four wastewaters were wastewater before primary settling (# 1 wastewater), wastewater after primary settling (# 2 wastewater), wastewater after activated sludge tank (# 3 wastewater), and centrate (# 4 wastewater), which is the wastewater generated in <b>sludge</b> <b>centrifuge.</b> The average specific growth rates in the exponential period were 0. 412, 0. 429, 0. 343, and 0. 948 day− 1 for wastewaters # 1, # 2, # 3, and # 4, respectively. The removal rates of NH 4 –N were 82. 4 %, 74. 7 %, and 78. 3 % for wastewaters # 1, # 2, and # 4, respectively. For # 3 wastewater, 62. 5 % of NO 3 –N, the major inorganic nitrogen form, was removed with 6. 3 -fold of NO 2 –N generated. From wastewaters # 1, # 2, and # 4, 83. 2 %, 90. 6 %, and 85. 6 % phosphorus and 50. 9 %, 56. 5 %, and 83. 0 % COD were removed, respectively. Only 4. 7 % was removed in # 3 wastewater and the COD in # 3 wastewater increased slightly after algal growth, probably due to the excretion of smal...|$|E
40|$|The {{self-treatment}} {{system of}} nature cannot handle man-caused high rate water pollution on its own, therefore cleaning in {{wastewater treatment plant}} (WWTP) is necessary to avoid eutrophication – excessive enrichment of nature by nutrients. Current technologies applied in WWTPs are old, outdating and highly energy demanding, especially biological treatment step generally requires {{large amount of energy}} for aeration of water. The alternative to current system could be microalgae treatment step, which would use green algae to consume pollutants present in the waste water, namely nitrogen, phosphorus and heavy metals. Via photosynthesis it could produce oxygen required for biological oxidation of organic matter. Furthermore carbon source is necessary for microalgal growth, this can be added to the water as CO 2 produced in other industries and so decrease global greenhouse gas footprint. Co-digestion of microalgae with undigested wastewater sludge under mesophilic conditions can give a synergic effect for biogas production, therefore harvested and co-digested microalgae could contribute to positive energy balance of WWTP. Full-scale microalgae cultivation in WWTP can be achieved only when good grow is guaranteed. This is a result of many factors, particularly access to nutrients, light condition, water temperature, and pH. The goal of master’s thesis was to understand and evaluate main factors influencing algal growth using literature review, propose design of microalgae treatment step with artificial lights and evaluate energy balance, of wastewater treatment plants in Uppsala and Västerås with new design. The work proposed two different designs of microalgae treatment steps, modelled in Excel and applied to current state of municipal WWTP in Västerås and Uppsala with belonging satellite plants. The first design of microalgae activated photobioreactor (MAASPBR) aimed to replace current biological treatment step. This is possible in Västerås and Uppsala WWTPs if microalgae can consume 75 % of total nitrogen (Ntot) and produce at least 13. 5 and 2. 4 tonne O 2 /day in Västerås and Uppsala respectively. The sensitivity analysis showed that minimal volumetric algal yield of 0. 15 kg/m 3,day and 0. 25 kg/m 3,day is required for Västerås and Uppsala respectively, when oxygen production rate of 1. 92 kg O 2 /kg microalgae is assumed. Furthermore harvested and co-digested algae with sewage sludge contributes to significant increase of biogas production and negligible transportation energy increase. The second design of open algal pond for reject water (OAPRW) aims to cultivate microalgae on reject water with high concentration of nutrients, generated in <b>sludge</b> <b>centrifuge.</b> The model assumed high algal growth due to excessive amount of nutrients and increased water temperature to 24 °C. Results show a possible 23 % and 20 % electricity saving on blowers in the biological treatment in Västerås and Uppsala respectively. Both models have positive impact on energy balance in all WWTPs, however MAASPBR has greater uncertainties, because this type of photobioreactor has not been tested unlike OAPRW which has been tested in pilot plant scale...|$|E

Our paper compares the fate of N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole (AC-SMX) residues between soils incubated with the same sludge but submitted to different processes before being added in soil. The fate of 14 C-AC-SMX residues was studied in mixtures of soil and sludges at different treatment levels: 1) activated and 2) <b>centrifuged</b> <b>sludges,</b> both enriched with 14 C-AC-SMX, and 3) limed and 4) heat-dried sludges obtained by treating the previously contaminated <b>centrifuged</b> <b>sludge.</b> The evolution of the extractability of 14 C residues (CaCl 2, methanol) and their mineralization were followed during 119 days. More than 80 % of the initial 14 C activity was no longer extractable after 14 days, except in soil with limed sludge. Liming and drying the <b>centrifuged</b> <b>sludge</b> decreased the mineralized 14 C fraction from 5. 7 - 6. 4 % to 1. 2 – 1. 8 % and consequently, the corresponding soils contained more 14 C residues after 119 days. Although 14 C residues were more CaCl 2 -extractable in soil with limed sludge, {{they seemed to be}} poorly bioavailable for biodegradation. For all solid sludges, the mineralization rate of 14 C-AC-SMX residues was strongly correlated to that of sludge organic carbon, with a coefficient three times lower for the limed and dried sludges than for the <b>centrifuged</b> <b>sludge</b> after 14 days...|$|R
40|$|The Zweckverband Landeswasserversorgung Stuttgart has {{developed}} {{a new type of}} decarbonization system which makes possible the recovery of ultra pure, industrially usable calcium carbonate by using lime water as a coagulant. The decarbonization process itself takes place on a line of the existing compact flocculation system which is used in the Langenau Waterworks for the treatment of Danube water. The ultra pure lime water is produced in a newly developed lime water preparation system. The whole decarbonization plant was planned for a capacity of 700 l/s. It contains the following systems: slaking of calcium oxide, preparation of lime water, compact flocculation plant, wet ball crusher, storage of thin <b>sludge,</b> <b>centrifuges</b> and loading station for the ultra pure thickened CaCO_ 3 sludge. With the exception of the compact flocculation plant all other parts of the plant had to be built new. After the prototype was put into operation, the lime water preparation system, the wet ball crusher and the centrifuges had to be optimized. Afterwards the whole plant worked very well. Up to now 65 million m" 3 ground water was decarbonized and 50, 000 t of pure CaCO_ 3 have been produced and sold. The sale solves the disposal problems and contributes to covering the operating costs of decarbonization. (orig.)

40|$|Start-up is {{one major}} {{problem that has}} been {{identified}} {{in the operation of}} UASB and other high rate anaerobic systems. This is related to the availability of seed material and the time required to develop the required high bacterial biomass. At present it is difficult to obtain a large amount of seed material to start-up a full scale UASB reactor because full scale operational reactors are located in {{only a limited number of}} places. Therefore the use of other seed materials is essential. In this thesis start-up of UASB reactors using abattoir wastewater stabilisation pond sludge was examined. Enhancing the rate of start-up with non-granular sludge is consequently a problem, because the dispersed nature of non-granular sludge limits its amount within a reactor making it easier to washout. This can result in a long period of start-up because the organic loading is highly dependent on the amount of sludge in the reactor. The use of <b>centrifuged</b> <b>sludge</b> may overcome this problem. It was hypothesised that the solids particles would be agglomerated and this would improve sludge retention, resulting in a greater number of the right type of microorganisms retained in the reactor. A study was carried out to examine the feasibility of using <b>centrifuged</b> <b>sludge</b> in the start-up of UASB reactors to test the above hypothesis and to follow the development of the sludge during start-up. Three sets of experiments were carried out. The first set of experiments was employed to determine if the methanogenic activity of abattoir wastewater stabilisation pond sludge deteriorated due to centrifugation. Initially the sludge from different ponds in the treatment facilities was tested for methanogenic activity. The results show that the best source of sludge was the third pond in a series of 3.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{provides}} {{data on the}} contamination {{of different kinds of}} <b>sludge</b> (raw, <b>centrifuged,</b> digested, thermally dried sludge and sludge cake) from Paris conurbation by 71 various pollutants including pharmaceutical products (PHPs), hormones, perfluorinated acids (PFAs), linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), alkylphenols (APs), phthalates (PAEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs). Very high contents of LAS (0. 1 – 10 g/kg dry matter - DM) compared to other compounds were found in all types of sludge followed by DEHP (10 – 100 mg/kg DM) and fluoroquinolones (1 – 100 mg/kg DM). APs were measured at intermediary contents in Parisian sludge, lying in the 2 – 20 mg/kg DM range. Finally, hormones, PAHs, PCBs, PAEs, PFAs and the remaining PHPs were all found at contents lower than 1 mg/kg DM. For most compounds (PHPs, PFOS, DEHP, PAHs), no significant differences in the micropollutant contents were found for similar types of sludge from different WWTP in Paris, highlighting the homogeneity of sludge contamination in downstream Paris catchment. The variability of concentration is rather high (coefficient of variation > 100 %) for several PHPs, PFAs or PCBs while it is moderate (< 100 %) or low (< 50 %) for fluoroquinolones, hormones, PAHs, APs or LAS. In addition, digestion seems to have a buffer effect as variabilities are lower in digested sludge for PHPs, PFAs, APs and PCBs. During sludge treatment (centrifugation, digestion, thermal drying, sludge conditioning + press filtration), the hormones, LAS, APs, PAHs, DEHP and PCBs concentrations increased, while those of PHPs and PFAs decreased. In the case of digestion, the increase of content can be explained by no pollutant removal or a lower removal than DM removal (concentration phenomenon) whereas the decrease underlines that the compound is more removed than the DM. In any case, these concentration variations presuppose the mechanisms of dissipation that could be attributed to volatilization, biotic or abiotic transformation (complete or with metabolites production), bound residues formation. In addition, data on <b>sludge</b> liquors - <b>centrifuged</b> (CW) and condensed (TDW) waters - from respectively centrifugation and thermal drying were collected. Several hormones, PHPs, PFAs, LAS, PAEs, APs, PCBs and PAHs were quantified in CW and TDW, displaying a transfer through the water removal.

40|$|Acetyl Sulfamethoxazole (AC-SMX) and {{acetaminophen}} (ACM) can {{be found}} in municipal sewage sludge, and their content and availability may be influenced by sludge treatments, such as drying and liming. A <b>sludge</b> similarly <b>centrifuged</b> with/without a flocculant was spiked with 14 C-labelled AC-SMX or ACM. Then, it was either limed (20 % CaO) or/and dried under different laboratory conditions (1 week at ambient temperature; and 48 h at 40 or 80 °C). The total amount and distribution of the 14 C-compounds among several chemical fractions, based on the sludge floc definition, were assessed {{at the end of the}} treatments. All the 14 C-activity brought initially was recovered in the limed and/or dried sludges for AC-SMX but only between 44. 4 and 84. 9 % for ACM, with the highest rate obtained for the limed sludge. Drying at 80 °C or liming increased the percentage of the sludge total organic carbon recovered in the extracts containing soluble extracellular polymeric substances (S-EPS) and the percentage of the total 14 C-activity extracted simultaneously. The non-extractable residues represented only 3. 9 - 11. 6 % of the total 14 C-activity measured in the treated sludges for AC-SMX and 16. 9 - 21. 8 % for ACM. The presence of AC-SMX and ACM residues in the treated sludges, after liming and drying under different conditions, was shown using some 14 C-labelled molecules. At this time scale and according to the extraction method selected, most of the 14 C-residues remained soluble and easily extractable for both compounds. This result implies that certain precautions should be taken when storing sludges before being spread on the field. Sludge piles, particularly the limed sludge, should be protected from rain to limit the production of lixiviates, which may contain residues of AC-SMX and ACM...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{comparative}} study, this research investigates {{the foundation for}} phosphorus (P) recycling (and reuse in agriculture) in two Danish urban areas (Copenhagen, and Roskilde), via selected nutrient recycling stakeholders (Wastewater Treatment Plants - WWTP). The Sewage treatment works (STW) chosen for the study are Avedøre WWTP (Copenhagen) operated by BIOFOS A/S, and Bjergmarken WWTP (Roskilde) operated by Forsyning Roskilde A/S. The STW selected for the study were chosen due to the timespan available for the master thesis research, and the consideration of other stakeholders involved in the phosphorus recycling agenda. The results show that phosphorus recycling is proactively being pursued in Roskilde, compared to Copenhagen. Avedøre WWTP incinerates sewage sludge (containing the p), and the resulting ash is deposited on site within their facility while the Bjergmarken WWTP recycles phosphorus via drying and pelletizing sewage sludge. Pelletized sludge is distributed to farmers, inherently contributing to the nutrients available for their agricultural activities. Momentarily, the STWs are enhanced for sanitation but not optimized for nutrient recycling, {{and there is a}} growing call for a shift in wastewater treatment paradigm (from the conventional sanitation model to a sanitation and recovery model). A potentially promising option for phosphorus recycling optimization within the STW could be achieved through controlled struvite precipitation. Struvite (magnesium- ammonium-phosphate hexahydrate - Mg·NH 4 ·PO 4 · 6 H 2 O) can be precipitated with the supernatant liquor from the <b>sludge</b> dewatering <b>centrifuge,</b> using a supplementary addition of magnesium.

40|$|The right {{individuation}} of {{the more}} convenient solution for final treatment and destination of sewage sludge deriving from wastewater plants, normally after anaerobic digestion process, {{is a very interesting}} problem, in accounting of urgent needs for acceptable solutions. The produced sludge, primarily after thermal drying, can be sent to energetic valorization processes as, for example, incineration, gasification and also pyrolysis.

Drying of the sludge from wastewater treatment plant is not extended too much in Czech Republic. In this work, the AOX are monitored, because AOX {{is one of the}} limits restraining use of the sludge on an agricultural land. Another reason is technological demand for using the sludge in cement processing, because chlorine in AOX can cause decrease in a heat transfer effect in a cement kiln. It is clear from the results that both <b>centrifuged</b> and dried <b>sludge</b> from the sewage treatment plant Brno fulfilled limits for using sludge on agriculture land. They can also be composted, in case they meet other requirements. If not, it is a possibility of co-incineration in cement kiln.

However, a phenol acclimation step was done to increase the possibility of finding genes related with phenol degradation. The sludge sample MBR 2 was acclimatized in batch-culture for a 30 day-period to 1.0 g L- 1 of phenol (Merck, USA) and then used for the metagenomic library construction. The acclimation step was performed, in triplicate, using 2.0 g L- 1 of <b>sludge,</b> which was <b>centrifuged</b> and placed into an Erlenmeyer flask containing 300 mL of an initial rich nutrient medium (2.75 g L- 1 K 2 HPO 4, 2.25 g L- 1 KH 2 PO 4, 0.1 g L- 1 NaCl, 1.0 g L- 1 (NH 4) 2 SO 4, 0.2 g L- 1 MgCl 2.6 H 2 O, 0.01 g L- 1 CaCl 2 and 1 g L- 1 yeast extract as carbon source).

40|$|Centrifugation of {{activated}} sludge is a frequently used dewatering process {{but there is}} a need for a fitting function for moderate and high sludge concentrations. In particular, liquid phase accumulation kinetics during centrifugation may be used as a source of information about sedimentation properties and governing mechanism of the cake formation. This will allow the obtention of the optimal parameters for the dewatering control and process optimisation. For this purpose, {{activated sludge}} at different concentrations was investigated on a laboratory centrifuge with centrifugation factor 2667. The following sludges were used in the experiments: 1) activated sludge from thickener (with and without floculant treatment); 2) <b>sludge</b> after industrial <b>centrifuge</b> decanter Flottweg Z 62 - 4 collected from dumping pound; sludge (2) after anaerobic treatment; sludge (2) with a dispersed solid additive. Based on the obtained data, the following assumption was made: settling of the solid phase and cake compaction depends on the hindered settling velocity and sediment compression. Due to the applied centrifuge force, a primary cake skeleton from particular aggregates and flocs is formed. During this stage, free water is displaced from the space between aggregates/flocs with a further transition to the compaction of the sediment with the water being displaced from the pores of the flocs by a filtration mechanism until an equilibrium condition is reached. The liquid volume V vs. time t at hindered settling and sediment dewatering can be represented in the form Vα tⁿ, where n ≤ 1. 0. Therefore, in log-log coordinates, the kinetics of liquid accumulation have a linear dependence lg(V) α n lg(t) in both settling and compaction stages. This assumption was confirmed for different types of activated sludge. Using asymptotical analysis in the function form F(t,V), a dimensionless fitting function was obtained that describes the centrifugation of activated sludge. For highly concentrated sludge, it was found that the dewatering occurs as cake compression. Analysis of deformation models leads to the conclusion that for the compressible cake it is necessary to introduce a parameter characterising the cake plasticity dependence on the centrifugation time. Developed model was used for fitting numerous experimental data. The main advantage of proposed model is the possibility to fit the liquid phase accumulation kinetics during centrifugation in a wide range of the activated sludge concentration, from suspension up to structured and paste-like cake consistency. The extension of this model to other slurries requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{sewage sludge}} {{production}} {{coming from the}} wastewater treatment is continuously increasing; taking also into account the high difficulty normally encountered in the sludge disposal, the individuation of innovative strategies or the optimization of the conventional existing systems for its final management {{seems to be a}} very important task. The produced sludge, chiefly if it has been subjected to thermal drying, is suitable for energetic valorization processes as, for example, incineration, gasification and pyrolysis. These processes present the very important positive aspect to lead to a correct management for the disposal problem; {{at the same time they}} can represent an useful energy source. From this point of view it is important to consider that, in opposition to the continuously increasing difficulty to generate energy from traditional fossil sources, the possibility to obtain energy from biomass (as for example from the sewage sludge), represents an interesting tool both for the reason that this source is certainly renewable and corresponding to the directives of the Kyoto protocol, and also for economical aspects (in fact the energy that is derived from traditional sources presents an always increasing cost). On the basis of these considerations the aim of the present work is the individuation of the optimal solution (in particular with a thermal treatment approach), for the correct disposal of the sewage sludge deriving from wastewater treatment, with particular reference to a specific large-scale example. In particular, in this work we examined, both from the technological and from the environmental point of view, the thermal solutions (direct combustion in incineration plant first of all, but also gasification), for the sludge deriving from the main Italian wastewater plant (plant of the metropolitan area of Torino).

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the current work were a) to identify the correlation between sewage sludge conditioning / dewatering processing and fate of a major sludge organic pollutant (Nonylphenol, NP) in sludge-amended soils and b) to provide, if possible, clues about the mechanism driving this correlation. In view was a contribution to predicting and controlling the fate of organic xenobiotics in the soil-sludge environment, by examining an until now not adequately studied, but nevertheless potentially determinant factor, i. e. the sludge treatment. The fate of a radiolabeled isomer of NP was compared in soils amended with sludges which had been treated by different conditioning and dewatering methods in the lab. Under the conditions tested, the experiments indicated:• a major impact of sludge centrifugation, leading to a considerably increased persistence of NP in soil• a moderate impact of freeze-thaw conditioning, leading to a moderate increase of the persistence of NP in soil• a minor effect of sludge liming, enhancing the formation of bound residues in soil with a concomitant lower mineralization rate of NP, {{as well as a}} slight increase in NP leaching potential• a minor effect of conditioning by a cationic acrylamide-based polymer, expressed as lower mineralization rates for prolonged incubation periods, as well as a slightly lower leaching potential of NP• a negligible impact of ferric chloride conditioning on the fate of NP in soil. For interpreting the effect of sludge treatment on NP fate in soil, it was attempted to link its transformation rates with specific parameters, either determined in the same systems (availability of NP to the aqueous phase, nutrients content, water content of sludge, profile of bacterial populations), or controlled during especially designed experiments (concentration of the pollutant in sludge, localization of the pollutant, soil or sludge biomass). Moreover, related data from the literature were co-evaluated. The increased persistence of NP in <b>centrifuged</b> <b>sludge</b> was attributed to its entrapment in remote sites / compact structures of the condensed matter in sludge aggregates, where it is not easily accessible to soil and sludge microorganisms, and where oxygen cannot easily penetrate either. Decreased availability of the NP located in the less permeable flocs of freeze-thawed sludge was similarly proposed as the most probable mechanism explaining the moderate increase of NP persistence in soils amended with this type of sludge. By addition of lime, the increased pH (primarily of sludge, but also of the amended soil) was assumed to be a factor favouring a) binding of oxidation products of NP to the soil or sludge humic substances – thus hindering further oxidation to CO 2 – as well as b) a slightly higher degree of deprotonation of NP – hence increasing its mobility towards the aqueous phase and groundwater bodies. A effect on soil and sludge populations involved in NP transformation processes was underlined as an equally alternative – or complementary - hypothesis for the lime-induced effects. Large flocs with dense cores appealed as a potential fact responsible for the declining mineralization rates for NP in sludge conditioned with a cationic polymer. The fraction of NP sorbed in these cores was probably less available to water, and thus less amenable to leaching. The results highlighted the physicochemical properties of sludge (e. g. size and compactness of sludge flocs) as more determinant to the fate of non-polar organic pollutants in soil, in comparison to its biological profile. As a consequence, application of advanced treatment techniques for the hygienization of sludge is not expected to have considerable drawbacks regarding the biological degradation of hydrophobic pollutants in the soil environment. The results furthermore propose sludge dewatering as one determinant process for the fate of organics in amended soils. Liquid sludge amendment showed to provide a means for significantly reducing risks associated to the persistence of NP and probably other pollutants in these systems, although in a real scenario extrinsic factors might interfere with the effect of sludge treatment. For mitigating the respective risks associated with the application of dewatered sludge, use of dewatering techniques relying on the removal of water rather than the flocculation of solids (e. g. bed drying) or an elimination of its pollutants whilst in liquid form (e. g. by bioaugmentation) were proposed. Finally, when decisions are to be made about the best available sludge treatment technique, a holistic approach has to be followed, taking into account, apart from organic pollutants related aspects, all beneficial, risk-related and economical factors associated with the recycling of sludge to the terrestrial environment...|$|R
