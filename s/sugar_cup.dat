50|$|Football in Fiji was {{dominated}} by the Ba team in the sixties. In the sixties Ba won the inter-district football tournament five times, the last {{three in a row}} from 1966 to 1968. Ba also won the North-west football tournament and the <b>Sugar</b> <b>Cup.</b> In 1968, the Fiji Football Association adopted a two tier system where Ba, Labasa, Lautoka, Nadi, Rakiraki, Rewa, Sigatoka and Suva were placed in division A and Levuka, Tailevu-Naitasiri, Tailevu North, Savusavu, Taveuni and Navua were placed in division B. Division B competed for the Fiji Football Association Cup, won for the first time by Levuka. At {{the end of the season}} there were promotion-relegation matches. In 1969 the inter-district football tournament was held in Labasa for the first time and Nadi won the trophy for the first time.|$|E

The front cover featured a smiling Worthington, contemplating putting lumps of <b>sugar</b> in his <b>cup</b> of tea; the book title is a deliberate sexual pun.|$|R
50|$|For the frosting: Two <b>cups</b> of {{granulated}} <b>sugar</b> and a <b>cup</b> {{and a half}} of water, boil until stringly, {{about five}} minutes usually does it. Beat the whites of two eggs very light, and pour the boiling sugar slowly into it, mixing well. Take out of this enough for the top and sides of the cake, and stir into the remainder for the filling between the two layers, one cup of finely chopped raisins and a cup of chopped nuts. This is delicious when properly baked.|$|R
5000|$|The {{other kind}} of [...] "cup cake" [...] {{referred}} to a cake whose ingredients were measured by volume, using a standard-sized cup, instead of being weighed. Recipes whose ingredients were measured using a standard-sized cup could also be baked in cups; however, they were more commonly baked in tins as layers or loaves. In later years, when the use of volume measurements was firmly established in home kitchens, these recipes became known as 1234 cakes or quarter cakes, so called because they {{are made up of}} four ingredients: one cup of butter, two <b>cups</b> of <b>sugar,</b> three <b>cups</b> of flour, and four eggs. They are plain yellow cakes, somewhat less rich and less expensive than pound cake, due to using about half as much butter and eggs compared to pound cake. The names of these two major classes of cakes were intended to signal the method to the baker; [...] "cup cake" [...] uses a volume measurement, and [...] "pound cake" [...] uses a weight measurement.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to use {{functional}} transcranial Doppler to investigate the possibility of revealing different activation patterns during healthy subjects' performance of meaningful and meaningless actions. Mean flow velocity (MFV) changes were recorded in middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) of 26 normal subjects during a rest phase and during performance of meaningful and meaningless actions. The meaningful task consisted of pouring <b>sugar</b> into a <b>cup</b> with a teaspoon. The meaningless action was an arm movement similar to that necessary for pouring <b>sugar</b> in a <b>cup</b> but without any tool and thus without a goal. Performing actions with or without meaning was associated with different patterns of MFV changes, as documented by the triple interaction condition x performing arm x side of recording [F(1, 25) = 10. 977; P= 0. 003]. During the meaningful action, MFV in MCAs increased significantly more than during the meaningless action. During the meaningless action, the MFV increase was significantly higher in the contralateral than in the ipsilateral MCA to the arm performing the task and the meaningful action determined a bilateral MFV increase only when the task was performed with the left arm. When the same task was performed with the right arm, the MFV increase was significantly higher in the contralateral than in the ipsilateral MCA. These findings suggest that the content of an action can influence MFV changes and further confirm the usefulness of transcranial Doppler in neuropsychological investigation...|$|R
40|$|Automated {{recognition}} of Activities of Daily Living allows to identify possible {{health problems and}} apply corrective strategies in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). Activities of Daily Living analysis can provide very useful information for elder care and long-term care services. This paper presents an automated RGB-D video analysis system that recognises human ADLs activities, related to classical daily actions. The main goal is to predict the probability of an analysed subject action. Thus, the abnormal behaviour can be detected. The activity detection and recognition is performed using an affordable RGB-D camera. Human activities, despite their unstructured nature, {{tend to have a}} natural hierarchical structure; for instance, generally making a coffee involves a three-step process of turning on the coffee machine, putting <b>sugar</b> in <b>cup</b> and opening the fridge for milk. Action sequence recognition is then handled using a discriminative Hidden Markov Model (HMM). RADiaL, a dataset with RGB-D images and 3 D position of each person for training as well as evaluating the HMM, has been built and made publicly available...|$|R
2500|$|In late 1864, Mrs. Lincoln {{ordered a}} new set of china for the White House. [...] This time, the {{importer}} was China Hall, a company owned by James K. Kerr of Philadelphia. The design this time was extremely simple: [...] A white plate, with a buff border edged in gilt lines. This 511-piece set consisted of dining plates, soup plates, dessert plates, ice cream plates, a wide variety of dishes (large and small fish platters, vegetable platters, side dish platters), tureens, sauce boats, pickle dishes, salad bowls, custard cups, fruit baskets (round and oval), fruit platters, <b>sugar</b> bowls, coffee <b>cups</b> and saucers, and other items. [...] This 181-piece set cost $1,700, and was billed on January 30, 1865. It's not clear which firm manufactured the china, but it is clearly of French make.|$|R
5000|$|In English units, the cup {{derived from}} {{measures}} of liquid volume is also frequently used for {{small amounts of}} dry measure for fine or granulated bulk goods such as flour and sugar. In Europe, recipes normally weigh non-liquid ingredients in grams instead, using a kitchen scale, rather than employing volume units such as milliliters. For example, where an American customary recipe might specify [...] "1 <b>cup</b> of <b>sugar</b> and 2 <b>cups</b> of milk", a European recipe might specify [...] "200 g sugar and 500 ml of milk" [...] (or 0.5 litre or 5 decilitres). Conversion between the two measures {{must take into account}} the density of the ingredients, and some recipes specify both weight and volume to simplify. Many European measuring cups have additional [...] "weight scales" [...] besides the dL or mL scale for reckoning the weight common bulk ingredients like sugar, flour, or rice by their volume.|$|R
40|$|The {{estimated}} {{population of the}} Bedouins are up to two million in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, but relatively little information is available about them. The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the oral hygiene dietary pattern and smoking habits of Saudi Bedouins population around Medina, Qaseen and Khamis Moshayte areas. Five hundred and twenty five Bedouins (296 male, 229 female) with the age range 2 - 90 years were interviewed and examined clinically over a period of four months (July to October 1998). It was found that 25 % of the subjects were miswak users, 30 % used miswak and tooth brush, while 26 % never cleaned their teeth. Almost 50 % of the subjects were regular in their oral hygiene habits. Seventy percent were rice eaters while meat and dates were second and third preference. Tea was the most common drink with 2 - 3 teaspoons of <b>sugar</b> per <b>cup.</b> Only ten percent were cigarette smokers and less than 5 % used shisha (traditional smoking pipe). It is concluded from the study that within the surveyed Bedouin population one fourth of them never cleaned their teeth while almost the same number used miswak (Chewing stick) to clean their teeth. Rice was the most common food item, while tea with refined sugar was the most common drink. Only 15 % were smoker. Further research is needed with a larger and a more representative sample of Bedouins from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|The Nebraska Master Mix {{can be used}} to {{make many}} dishes easily. The {{homemade}} mix offers the advantage, over bought mixes, of choosing your own combination of ingredients. For example, you may want to try the whole wheat version with margarine for a deliciously different mix. Simple meals and leftovers can be sparked up by adding a homemade hotbread or other food made from the Nebraska Master Mix. The Nebraska Master Mix is lower in fat than some but gives very good results. Sugar has been reduced in some of the recipes, but other ingredients have been used to enhance flavor. Thus in banana bread only 1 / 4 <b>cup</b> <b>sugar</b> is used but more banana is called for than in traditional recipes. Families of one or two may prefer to halve the MIX and very large families double it. This Home Extension Guide includes recipes for the Nebraska Master Mix, breads, pancakes, tortillas, turnovers, pizza dough, coffee cake, brownies, and cookies...|$|R
6000|$|The summer {{life had}} been very {{different}} from the winter one. There was much less intercourse with the Homestead, partly from Rachel being much engrossed with the F. U. E. E., driving over whenever the coachman would let her, to inspect progress, and spending much of her time in sending out circulars, answering letters, and writing a tale on the distresses of Woman, and how to help them, entitled [...] "Am I not a Sister?" [...] Tales were not much in Bachel's line; she despised reading them, and did not love writing them, but she knew that she must <b>sugar</b> the <b>cup</b> for the world, and so she diligently applied herself to the piece de resistance for the destined magazine, heavily weighting her slender thread of story with disquisitions on economy and charity, and meaning to land her heroines upon various industrial asylums where their lot should be far more beatific than marriage, which was reserved for the naughty one to live unhappy in ever after. In fact, Rachel, in her stern consistency, had made up her mind to avoid and discourage the Colonel, and to prevent her own heart from relenting in his favour, or him from having any opportunity of asking an explanation, and with this determination she absented herself both from Ermine's parlour and Lady Temple's croquet ground; and if they met on the esplanade or in a morning call, took care never to give the chance of a tete-a-tete, which he was evidently seeking.|$|R
60|$|As I have indicated, Mr. S.'s economies were of {{a pretty}} close and rigid kind. By and by, when we {{apprentices}} were promoted from the basement to the ground floor and allowed {{to sit at the}} family table, along with the one journeyman, Harry H., the economies continued. Mrs. S. was a bride. She had attained to that distinction very recently, after waiting a good part of a lifetime for it, and she was the right woman in the right place, according to the economics of the place, for she did not trust the sugar-bowl to us, but sweetened our coffee herself. That is, she went through the motions. She didn't really sweeten it. She seemed to put one heaping teaspoonful of brown <b>sugar</b> into each <b>cup,</b> but, according to Steve, that was a deceit. He said she dipped the spoon in the coffee first to make the sugar stick, and then scooped the sugar out of the bowl with the spoon upside down, so that the effect to the eye was a heaped-up spoon, whereas the sugar on it was nothing but a layer. This all seems perfectly true to me, and yet that thing would be so difficult to perform that I suppose it really didn't happen, but was one of Steve's lies.|$|R
