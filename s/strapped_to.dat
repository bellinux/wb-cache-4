5|$|The episode {{opens with}} FBI special agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{bleeding}} {{out from a}} gunshot wound while Scully tends to him. They are revealed to be hostages in a bank holdup, and Scully attempts to reason with their captor (Darren E. Burrows), only to have him reveal a bomb <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> his chest. The police begin to storm the building, prompting the gunman to detonate the bomb, seemingly killing them all.|$|E
50|$|Hook is a {{rectangular}} shape, {{similar to the}} slides but with an opening at its one end which used to hang detachable or multi-way <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> a bra. It is hooking bra shoulder <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> a strapless bra, re-positioning the <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> achieve the various looks, such as halter-neck and crossed-back.|$|R
50|$|Watch straps may {{close with}} a buckle or a {{butterfly}} clasp. Expanding watchstraps are designed to expand elastically, often {{by the use of}} metal springs in a segmented design, and may be slipped on like a bracelet. Attachment points for the <b>strap</b> <b>to</b> the watch are largely standardized, with a spring-loaded double-ended pin used to anchor the watch <b>strap</b> <b>to</b> holes in a bracket that is integral to the watch case, allowing worn watch <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> be replaced or swapped with new straps for fashion purposes.|$|R
50|$|Another {{application}} is spot welding <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> nickel-cadmium or nickel-metal hydride cells to make batteries. The cells {{are joined by}} spot welding thin nickel <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> the battery terminals. Spot welding can keep the battery from getting too hot, as might happen if conventional soldering were done.|$|R
5|$|Walter Golic (Paul McGann) is {{a mentally}} {{unstable}} murderer and arsonist who is imprisoned on Fury 161. He sees the Alien killing Boggs and Rains and is later {{found in the}} cafeteria eating cereal, his face covered in blood. Golic is presumed to have turned on his fellow inmates, and he is <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> a bed in the infirmary {{under the supervision of}} Clemens and Ripley. When the Alien kills Clemens, he watches the creature admiringly.|$|E
5|$|William Easton, an {{insurance}} executive for Umbrella Health, meets with Debbie, the company's attorney, about Harold Abbott, who succumbed {{to heart disease}} after his coverage request was denied due to an application discrepancy. Hoffman abducts Easton from his office that night and brings him to an abandoned zoo, {{where he and his}} janitor, Hank, awaken in vises designed to tighten around their torsos each time they breathe into oxygen masks <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> their faces. John himself appears in a videotape and informs William that he has one hour to complete four tests and remove the bombs <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> his limbs, or he will lose his family. Hank, a heavy smoker, is unable to hold his breath for long and is killed by the vise. William's other tests force him to choose which of his workers to save from various traps, including a hanging room, a steam room, and a shotgun aimed at seats of a carousel. It is shown that John met William at the opening of Jill's clinic and took issue with his formula for deeming policyholders worthy of coverage. After his cancer was diagnosed, John's coverage request for an experimental Norwegian treatment was rejected by William.|$|E
5|$|Amy awakens to {{find herself}} <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> an {{examining}} table, near to where Ambrose's husband Mo is also ensnared. Mo explains that the Silurians intended to vivisect her, as they have vivisected him— awake. The Doctor and Nasreen arrive underground in the TARDIS; the Doctor explains about the Silurians and says that he expects to encounter {{only a few of}} the creatures. The show ends on a cliffhanger as the Doctor and Nasreen behold an immense Silurian civilisation in the caverns below the earth.|$|E

50|$|Furniture {{is often}} {{strapped}} using a method called double wrap where the strap is {{wrapped around the}} frame, the fastening rivet, and itself on each end.This makes {{it very difficult for}} the <b>strap</b> <b>to</b> pull away from the frame and normally requires the <b>strap</b> <b>to</b> be cut in order to remove it.|$|R
50|$|Rings {{are used}} for joining <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> allow length {{adjustment}} and vary <b>strap</b> angle <b>to</b> bra cup. A ring can be in any shape, for example circular, rectangular, triangular or even heart and flower shaped.|$|R
5|$|James and Sanborn's unit {{is called}} to another mission in their last two days of their rotation. An {{innocent}} Iraqi civilian has had a bomb vest <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> his chest. James tries {{to cut off the}} locks to remove the vest, but there are too many of them. He abandons the man, who is killed when the bomb explodes. Sanborn is distraught by the man's death. He confesses to James that he can no longer cope with the pressure, and wants to return home and have a son.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{wakes up}} to find himself <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> a table, where Ben, Tom (M. C. Gainey) and two other Others watch over him. Sawyer is gagged before {{inserting}} a large hypodermic needle into his chest. When Sawyer awakens, Ben enters, carrying a rabbit in a cage; he shakes the cage vigorously, causing the rabbit to suddenly collapse, presumably dead. Ben informs Sawyer that they fitted him, like the rabbit, with a modified pacemaker; should his heart rate reach 140, his heart would explode. Ben threatens to implant one in Kate if Sawyer should tell her of his ordeal.|$|E
5|$|The copious {{amounts of}} blood spilled {{in the fight}} scenes came from bags of fake blood <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> the performers' bodies. Animal blood {{gathered}} from slaughterhouses was poured onto the floor to simulate puddles of human blood. Most of the times trick swords made from fiberglass were used when the scene called for a killing blow. Designed by Allder, these swords could also retract their blades, and several sprayed blood from their tips. Although the swords were intended to be safer alternatives to metal weapons, they could still be dangerous: {{in one of the}} fights, Bergman sparred with an extra who failed to follow the choreography and sliced open her finger.|$|E

5|$|The {{failed attempt}} to kill Bond while at Royale-Les-Eaux was {{inspired}} by Fleming's knowledge of the attempted assassination of Franz von Papen, Vice-Chancellor of Germany and an ambassador under Hitler. Both Papen and Bond survived their assassination attempts, carried out by Bulgarians, because trees protected them from the blasts. The torture scene in which Bond's genitals are thrashed while he is <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> a bottomless chair was a version of a French-Moroccan torture technique, , in which the steel string of a mandolin was used to slice in half the testicles of British wartime agents.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{theme for}} the video is the Chinese legend of Houyi. The video goes on to {{introduce}} King Di-Jun, his ten sons (who are also the Celestial Suns), Queen Xi and Warrior Yi. The video shows one of the King's ten sons being <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> {{the back of the}} jade dragon, but breaks free and the sons made life on Earth unbearable, so the King send the warrior who was introduced earlier to kill them. He succeeds in finding them, and kills all but one.|$|E
5|$|Dexter {{is called}} to a crime scene at the {{abandoned}} hospital where, last night, the Ice Truck Killer left security guard Tony Tucci (Brad William Henke) <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> a table for Dexter to kill. Instead, Dexter had reported the crime scene and Tucci had been hospitalized after the Killer had amputated his hand and leg. Debra and Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) question Tucci when he wakes up in hospital, but Doakes is unimpressed with Debra's ways of extracting information from Tucci. He disapproves of her suggestion to blindfold Tucci to help him to remember his encounter with the Killer, but after she confronts him about his attitude toward her, he agrees to blindfold Tucci, who remembers that the Killer used throat lozenges. They return {{to the crime scene}} and find a lozenge wrapper, on which forensics expert Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee) finds a partial fingerprint.|$|E

5|$|Joseph Brittan had varied {{interests}} and immediately upon arrival in Christchurch, joined others in various activities. He played cricket in Hagley Park within a fortnight of reaching Christchurch, and later helped improve the grounds and {{raised money for}} fencing the area. He was into horse racing, later bred horses, and Canterbury's first steeplechase was held on his Linwood farm. The Brittans were into music and his wife Sophia Brittan brought her piano from England. Joseph Brittan had a portable harmonium and as in the early years, Lyttelton was culturally more important than Christchurch, he joined a musical group in the port town. For performances, he walked over the Bridle Path with the instrument <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> his back. Musical evenings were also held at the Brittan home.|$|E
5|$|Rescue {{workers at}} the World Trade Center site began to {{discover}} body fragments from Flight11 victims {{within days of the}} attack. Some workers found bodies <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> airplane seats and discovered the body of a flight attendant with her hands bound, suggesting the hijackers might have used plastic handcuffs. Within a year, medical examiners had identified the remains of 33victims who had been on board Flight11. They identified two other Flight11 victims, including purser Karen Martin, in 2006, while other unrelated body fragments were discovered near Ground Zero around the same time. In April 2007, examiners using newer DNA technology identified another Flight11 victim. The remains of two hijackers, potentially from Flight11, were also identified and removed from Memorial Park in Manhattan. The remains of the other hijackers have not been identified and are buried with other unidentified remains at this park.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before midnight, Taylor was {{led into}} the {{execution}} chamber and <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> a chair 17 {{feet away from the}} shooters with a hood covering his head. Multiple bright lights covered Taylor. Sandbags were arranged behind him to prevent any ricochets. The captain walked down the aisle, tapping each shooter on the shoulder to check to see if they were ready. At 12:03 a.m. Mountain Standard Time on January 26, 1996, every shooter fired at the count of five and the white cloth target on Taylor's chest flew off. His chest moved upward and his left hand tightened into a fist. His grip gradually loosened and his head fell back. A doctor checked Taylor's neck for a pulse and cut two holes in his hood to check for a pupillary light reflex. Taylor was declared dead at 12:07 a.m. and became the 49th person to be executed in the state of Utah since 1852.|$|E

5|$|The Pip-Boy – a small {{computer}} <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> the character's wrist {{which contains}} maps, statistics, data, and items – {{plays a role}} in both Fallout 4 and Nuka-World. When the player reaches level thirty and is able to explore Nuka-World, the Pip-Boy receives a radio signal alerting the player. Nuka-World adds minor additions to the game's crafting mechanics, allowing the player to mix varieties of Nuka-Cola to create new flavors; these grant the player additional status buffs, such as temporary boosts to health, increased damage resistance, or improved S.P.E.C.I.A.L attributes. S.P.E.C.I.A.L. is an acronym denoting the character attributes which the player can distribute through the means of acquired stat points. The available character attributes consist of: strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility, and luck. In order to create these items, players need to collect raw materials from the game world and find recipe books to unlock new flavors.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{gameplay}} mechanics which {{carried over}} from the previous iterations is V.A.T.S. (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System). While using V.A.T.S., real-time combat is slowed, allowing the player to choose where to shoot the enemy: shooting enemies in the head will typically result in death while shooting their legs can slow them. Weapons can also be shot at to disarm the enemy. Using V.A.T.S. lowers the player's stamina (Action Points, or AP). Some actions are unavailable to the player if their stamina is insufficient, {{in which case the}} player has to wait for their AP to regenerate. The use of Power Armor in combat increases {{the rate at which the}} player's AP are used. The Pip-Boy, a small computer <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> the character's wrist, also plays a role in both Fallout 4 and Far Harbor. It contains a menu which the player can access to view maps, statistics, data, and items, and when the player is able to visit Far Harbor, the Pip-boy will receive a signal from Valentine's Detective Agency.|$|E
5|$|Production {{moved to}} the Czech Republic later in May, {{scheduled}} for 12 weeks of shooting, which included a scene in Pernštejn Castle. Using a former sugar factory in Prague, production designer John Myhre constructed a large textile factory {{as part of an}} industrial world, the setting of a mythological environment in which looms create fabrics that weavers interpret as assassination orders. Afterward, filming moved to Budapest, then returned to Chicago in August. While the actors performed many of their own stunts, with free running and parkour in some of the action scenes, and Angelina Jolie being actually <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> the hood of a moving Dodge Viper, some of the especially high-risk sequences required digital doubles instead. Two full-sized train cars were built, a Chicago 'L' for a training scene where Fox and Wesley run atop a train, and a Czech Pendolino for the derailment, which was stationed in a gimbal equipped with hydraulics to allow the car to tilt and roll as the train crashed. The film originally had both an alternate opening and an alternate ending. The alternate opening, a flashback to ancient times describing the history of the Fraternity and the Loom of Fate, is available on the special edition DVD and Blu-ray.|$|E
