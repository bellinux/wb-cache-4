Benzoic acid is more soluble in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane or diethyl ether, and when shaken with this organic solvent in a <b>separatory</b> funnel, will preferentially dissolve in the organic layer. The other reaction products, including the magnesium bromide, will remain in the aqueous layer, clearly showing that separation based on solubility is achieved. This process, known as liquidâ€“liquid extraction, is an important technique in synthetic chemistry. Recycling is used to ensure maximum extraction.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} {{of using a}} <b>separatory</b> funnel is emulsions can form easily, and can {{take a long time}} to separate once formed. They are often formed while liquids are being mixed in the <b>separatory</b> funnel. This can occur when small droplets are suspended in an aqueous solution. If an emulsion is formed, one technique used to separate the liquids is to slowly swirl the solution in the <b>separatory</b> funnel. If the emulsion is not separated by this process, a small amount of saturated saline solution is added.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>separatory</b> funnel runs on {{the concept}} of [...] "like dissolves like", with {{different}} solutes being preferentially soluble in certain solvents. While a <b>separatory</b> funnel is being shaken, the two solvents mix and share a large surface area, which allows each solute to migrate to the solvent in which it is more soluble.|$|E
5000|$|Countercurrent {{distribution}} (CCD, also spelled [...] "co [...] "counter current" [...] distribution) is {{an analytical}} chemistry technique which {{was developed by}} Lyman C. Craig in the 1940s. Countercurrent distribution is a separation process that is founded {{on the principles of}} liquid-liquid extraction where a chemical compound is distributed (partitioned) between two immiscible liquid phases (oil and water for example) according to its relative solubility in the two phases. The simplest form of liquid-liquid extraction is the partitioning of a mixture of compounds between two immiscible liquid phases in a <b>separatory</b> funnel. This occurs in five steps: 1) preparation of the <b>separatory</b> funnel with the two phase solvent system, 2) introduction of the compound mixture into the <b>separatory</b> funnel, 3) vigorous shaking of the <b>separatory</b> funnel to mix the two layers and allow for mass transfer of compounds {{in and out of the}} phases, 4) The contents of the <b>separatory</b> funnel are allowed to settle back into two distinct phases and 5) the two phases are separated from each other by draining out the bottom phase. If a compound is insoluble in the lower phase it will distribute into the upper phase and stay in the <b>separatory</b> funnel. If a compound is insoluble in the upper phase it will distribute into the lower phase and be removed from the <b>separatory</b> funnel. If the mixture contains one or more compounds that are soluble in the upper phase and one or more compounds that are soluble in the lower phase, then an extraction has occurred. Often, an individual compound is soluble to a certain extent in both phases and the extraction is, therefore, incomplete. The relative solubility of a compound in two phases is known as the partition coefficient.|$|E

50|$|A <b>separatory</b> funnel, {{also known}} as {{separation}} funnel, separating funnel, or colloquially sep funnel, {{is a piece of}} laboratory glassware used in liquid-liquid extractions to separate (partition) the components of a mixture into two immiscible solvent phases of different densities. Typically, one of the phases will be aqueous, and the other a lipophilic organic solvent such as ether, MTBE, dichloromethane, chloroform, or ethyl acetate. All of these solvents form a clear delineation between the two liquids. The more dense liquid, typically the aqueous phase unless the organic phase is halogenated, sinks and can be drained out through a valve away from the less dense liquid, which remains in the <b>separatory</b> funnel.|$|E

50|$|While solvent {{extraction}} is often {{done on a}} small scale by synthetic lab chemists using a <b>separatory</b> funnel, Craig apparatus or membrane-based techniques, it is normally done on the industrial scale using machines that bring the two liquid phases into contact with each other.

5000|$|While one <b>separatory</b> funnel {{is useful}} in {{separating}} certain compound mixtures with a carefully formulated biphasic solvent system, a series of <b>separatory</b> funnels may be employed to separate compounds that have different partition coefficients. Countercurrent distribution, therefore, is a method of using a series of vessels (<b>separatory</b> funnels) to separation compounds by a sequence of liquid-liquid extraction operations. Contrary to liquid-liquid extraction, in the CCD instruments the upper phase is decanted from the lower phase once the phases have settled. First, a mixture is introduced to vessel 1 (V1) charged with both phases and the liquid-liquid extraction process is performed. The upper phase is added to a second vessel (V2) which already holds fresh lower phase. Fresh upper phase is added to V1. Both vessels are shaken and allowed to settle. upper phase from V1 is transferred to V2 {{at the same time}} the upper phase from V2 is transferred to V3 which already holds fresh lower phase. Fresh upper phase is added to V1, all three vessels are shaken and settled and the process continues. Compounds that are more soluble in the upper phase than lower phase faster and farther down the series of vessels (the [...] "train") while those compounds which are more soluble in the lower phase than the upper phase tend to lag behind. A compound insoluble in the upper phase will remain in V1 while a compound insoluble in the lower phase will stay in the lead vessel.|$|E
50|$|The largest risk {{when using}} a <b>separatory</b> funnel {{is that of}} {{pressure}} build-up. Pressure accumulates during mixing if a gas evolving reaction or physical change occurs.

50|$|Purification of amines: Amines (analogously to ammonia) have a lone pair of {{electrons}} on the nitrogen atom that can form a relatively weak bond to a hydrogen atom. It is therefore the case that under acidic conditions amines are typically protonated, carrying a positive charge and under basic conditions they are typically deprotonated and neutral. Amines of sufficiently low molecular weight are rather polar and can form hydrogen bonds with water and therefore will readily dissolve in aqueous solutions. Deprotonated amines on the other hand, are neutral and have greasy, nonpolar organic substituents, and therefore have a higher affinity for nonpolar inorganic solvents. As such purification steps can be carried out where an aqueous solution of an amine is neutralized with a base such as sodium hydroxide, then shaken in a <b>separatory</b> funnel with a nonpolar solvent that is immiscible with water. The organic phase is then drained off. Subsequent processing can recover the amine by techniques such as recrystallization, evaporation or distillation; subsequent extraction back to a polar phase can be performed by adding HCl and shaking again in a <b>separatory</b> funnel (at which point the ammonium ion could be recovered by adding an insoluble counterion), or in either phase, reactions could be performed as part of a chemical synthesis.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} this is the {{synthesis}} of benzoic acid from phenylmagnesium bromide and dry ice.

50|$|Liquid-liquid {{extraction}} (LLE), {{also known}} as solvent extraction and partitioning, is a method to separate compounds based on their relative solubilities in two different immiscible liquids, usually water and an organic solvent. It is an extraction of a substance from one liquid into another liquid phase. It consists of transferring one (or more) solute(s) contained in a feed solution to another immiscible liquid (solvent). The solvent that is enriched in solute(s) is called extract. The feed solution that is depleted in solute(s) is called the raffinate. LLE is a basic technique in chemical laboratories, where it is performed {{using a variety of}} apparatus, from <b>separatory</b> funnels to countercurrent distribution equipment. This type of process is commonly performed after a chemical reaction as part of the work-up, often including an acidic work up.|$|E
50|$|Partition {{chromatography}} {{theory and}} practice of was introduced through the work and publications of Archer Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge during the 1940s. The process of separating mixtures of chemical compounds by passing them through a column that contained a solid stationary phase that was eluted with a mobile phase (column chromatography) was well known at that time. Chromatographic separation was considered to occur by an adsorption process whereby compounds adhered to a solid media and were washed off the column with a solvent, mixture of solvents, or solvent gradient. In contrast, Martin and Synge developed and described a chromatographic separation process whereby compounds where partitioned between two liquid phases similar to the <b>separatory</b> funnel liquid-liquid separation dynamic. This was an important departure, both in theory and in practice, from adsorption chromatography.|$|E
50|$|To use a <b>separatory</b> funnel, the {{two phases}} and {{the mixture to}} be {{separated}} in solution are added through the top with the stopcock at the bottom closed. The funnel is then closed and shaken gently by inverting the funnel multiple times; if the two solutions are mixed together too vigorously emulsions will form. The funnel is then inverted and the tap carefully opened to release excess vapor pressure. The separating funnel is set aside {{to allow for the}} complete separation of the phases. The top and the bottom tap are then opened and the lower phase is released by gravitation. The top must be opened while releasing the lower phase to allow pressure equalization between the inside of the funnel and the atmosphere. When the bottom layer has been removed, the stopcock is closed and the upper layer is poured out through the top into another container.|$|E
50|$|A heating mantle, or isomantle, is a {{piece of}} {{laboratory}} equipment used to apply heat to containers, as an alternative to other forms of heated bath. In contrast to other heating devices, such as hotplates or Bunsen burners, glassware containers may be placed in direct contact with the heating mantle without substantially increasing the risk of the glassware shattering, because the heating element of a heating mantle is insulated from the container so as to prevent excessive temperature gradients. Heating mantles may have various forms. In a common arrangement, electric wires are embedded within a strip of fabric that can be wrapped around a flask. The current supplied to the device, and hence the temperature achieved, is regulated by a rheostat. This type of heating mantle is quite useful for maintaining an intended temperature within a <b>separatory</b> funnel, for example, after the contents of a reaction have been removed from a primary heat source.|$|E
