25|$|One of {{the primary}} reasons that {{wildlife}} is seen on airports is an abundance of food. Food resources on airports can be either removed or made less desirable. One of the most abundant food resources found on airports is turfgrass. This grass is planted to reduce runoff, control erosion, absorb jet wash, allow passage of emergency vehicles, and to be aesthetically pleasing (DeVault et al. 2013) However, turfgrass is a preferred food source for species of birds that pose serious risk to aircraft, chiefly the Canada goose (Branta canadensis). Turfgrass planted at airports should be a species that geese do not prefer (e.g. <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine</b> <b>grass)</b> and should be managed {{in such a way}} that reduces its attractiveness to other wildlife such as small rodents and raptors (Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010, DeVault et al. 2013). It has been recommended that turfgrass be maintained at a height of 7-14 inches through regular mowing and fertilization (U.S. Air Force 2004).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides) {{has been}} widely {{confirmed}} to have very strong tolerance to flooding and even complete submergence and, therefore, is a considerably excellent species for stabilization and revegetation of “wet ” barren slopes and for wastewater treatment. However, it is poorly documented why vetiver is so tolerant to submergence. To understand the mechanisms of vetiver’s tolerance to submergence, an experiment was conducted to examine ecophysiological, biochemical, and anatomical characteristics of vetiver leaves under submergence compared to other three <b>grasses,</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine</b> (Stenotaphrum secundatum), carpet grass (Axonopus compressus), and bahia grass (Paspalum notatum). After stressed by submergence, the contents of photosynthetic pigments of <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine</b> and carpet <b>grass</b> decreased while those of vetiver and bahia grass increased from 18 - to 54 -day submergence, especially for vetiver, its chl(a+b) and car/chl increased by 63. 9 % and 72. 8 %, respectively. Within 36 d submergence, Fv/Fm and _PS _ of <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine</b> and carpet <b>grass</b> declined distinctly, but those of vetiver and bahia grass only declined slightly. This suggests that the latter two grasses were influenced very little with special reference to their photosynthetic apparatus; therefore their photosynthesi...|$|R

50|$|Symptoms of St. Augustine Decline Syndrome on <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine</b> <b>Grass</b> (Stenotaphrum secundatum) are mild green mosaics in {{addition}} to mottling and streaking of leaves. In extreme cases, a turf grass crop may experience chlorosis if the disease affects susceptible plants. The disease is spread only through mechanical vectors, such as mowing. At this time, the only method of control for panicum mosaic virus is planting resistant cultivars. In turf grass, the disease is geographically centered around the southcentral and southeastern United States, due to the high prevalence of non-resistant turf species.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{method of}} {{controlling}} St. Augustine Decline Syndrome is breeding resistant varieties. This method of resistance breeding {{has been successful}} in turf grass because it has led to the production of two resistant cultivars of <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine</b> <b>grass,</b> FA-108 and FA-2002 (nicknamed ‘Raleigh’, and ‘Seville’). Aside from resistance genes, another option of managing St. Augustine Decline Syndrome is cultural control by cleaning tools between mowing different properties {{to prevent the spread of}} pathogen. [...] A third control option for St. Augustine Decline is to mow turf grass only during dry weather because the infected sap is not able to spread as easily.|$|E
50|$|Some {{types of}} zoysia are {{available}} commercially as sod in some areas. In typical savanna climates with warm {{wet and dry}} seasons, such as southern Florida, zoysia grasses grow during the warm-wet summer and are dormant in the drier, cooler winter months. They are popular because of their fine texture, soft feel, and low growth habit. They can form dense mats and even mounds that grow over low features. In contrast to <b>St.</b> <b>Augustine</b> <b>grass,</b> they generally require less fertilization and are less vulnerable to insect and fungus damage, depending on environmental conditions. For best appearance, turf experts recommend reel blade mowers for zoysia.|$|E
