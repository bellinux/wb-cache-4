50|$|On {{the supply}} <b>side</b> (<b>distribution),</b> the {{electric}} utilities {{are bound to}} adapt to consumer load profiles, {{in order to keep}} the electricity grid balanced. These load-profiles are statistically planned in advance and usually covered by long-term supply contracts, or own production of electric energy. Often however, irregularities in the long-term prognosis occur and the utilities are obliged to procure, or sell the outstanding quantities of electric energy on the market. The irregularities on the demand side are usually determined by the varying consumption of electric power by households and the industry, which depend again mostly on the changing weather conditions.In the recent years, the European markets have witnessed a steady rise of price volatility that was caused among other factors, by the augmented use of renewable energy sources - which can be explained by the fact that a larger portion of the overall electricity production in Europe depends nowadays on weather, especially wind power plants.|$|E

However, due to a relentless 18 months of hard work, the strain had started to take its toll on singer Bev, who was diagnosed with nodules on her vocal cords and ordered to rest. In order that Bev could make the trip, a second singer, Joey Hill joined to help split the set and provide Bev with some much needed cover. Joey, amazingly, with only a couple of rehearsals and a rush-organised gig at the Cartoon, Croydon, was able to make the US shows.So it was, that in September 2004 the Cherrees set off for New York with Conflict, to play two nights at the legendary CBGB.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the effect of}} water mists on premixed flame propagation under reduced-gravity conditions is being conducted to aid in the understanding of the fundamental interactions between a flame front and water mist Computer modeling shows that the sensible and latent heats of water, as well as increased water concentration, decrease the speed of a propagating flame. Decreasing mist droplet diameter, given a constant water mass fraction, also decreases flame speed. Modeling of the absorption of radiation by water mist droplets shows an increase in the evaporation rates ofthe droplets, which in turn causes a further inhibiting effect on flame propagation. An under-standing of the dynamics of the water mist aerosol is necessary to estimate the mist loadings and droplet diameters used as input for the model.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceReduction of {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) emission is gaining momentum in recent years, and the transportation industry {{is one of the}} major contributors. Electric vehicles are proven to have very low greenhouse gas emissions in comparison to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. In addition, the electrical vehicle (EV) market is growing rapidly, and the charging of EVs will affect the power grid because charging a single electric vehicle is estimated to consume as much power as an average household for an entire day. This thesis modeled the charging of electric vehicles at the residential level and proposed different controller models for charging EVs in order to minimize the impact of their penetration. In addition, this thesis modeled and evaluated the uncertainty factor for load due to the EV penetration.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we present {{the first night}} <b>side</b> <b>distribution</b> of SO 2 content in Venus’ upper {{mesosphere}} (altitudes from 85 to 105 km). The dataset {{is based on the}} SPICAV UV stellar occultation experiment which took place onboard ESA's Venus Express (VEX) orbiter in 2006 - 2014. The UV channel of SPICAV spectrometer detected absorption bands of SO 2 and CO 2 in the spectral range 180 - 300 nm with a resolution of 1 - 2 nm while stellar light was occulted by the mesosphere. Altitude profiles of sulfur dioxide's volume mixing ratio (VMR) could be retrieved in {{the upper part of the}} mesosphere covering the whole night side on Venus. In parallel, we have reprocessed the terminator UV solar occultations dataset (Belyaev et al. (2012). Icarus 217, 740 - 751) in the same altitude range and extended its statistics until 2014. On average the SO 2 VMR increases with altitude from 10 - 30 ppb at 85 km to 100 - 300 ppb at 100 km in both regimes of occultation. The midnight SO 2 abundance appears to be 3 - 4 times higher than in the terminator region: 150 - 200 ppbv versus 50 pppv at altitude around 95 km. These new results were compared with the distribution of oxygen atoms, which are tracers of the global subsolar-antisolar (SS-AS) circulation at ∼ 100 km (the data provided by Soret et al. (2012).
