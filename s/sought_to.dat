Kirchner <b>sought</b> <b>to</b> generate an image contrasting with those of former presidents Carlos Menem and Fernando de la Rúa.

5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, battle {{was not necessary}} for either side; the main strategic theatre was mainland Greece itself. Although destroying the enemy navy {{would result in a}} clear strategic advantage for both sides, attempting this risked the loss of their own navy.
