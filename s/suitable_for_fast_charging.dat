40|$|A novel {{planning}} {{method of}} fast electric vehicle (EV) charging stations on a round freeway was developed, considering the {{spatial and temporal}} transportation behaviors. A spatial and temporal model based on the origin-destination (OD) analysis was developed to obtain all the EV charging points (the location on the round freeway that an EV needs recharging due to the low battery capacity). Based on a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) clustering algorithm, a location determination model was developed to obtain the specific locations for EV charging stations with their service EV clusters. A capacity determination model based on the queuing theory was proposed to determine the capacity of each EV charging station. The round-island freeway in Hainan Island of China was employed as a test system to illustrate the planning method. Simulation {{results show that the}} developed planning method can not only accurately determine the most <b>suitable</b> locations <b>for</b> EV <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> stations considering the travelling convenience of EV users, but also minimize the sum of waiting cost and charger cost...|$|R

40|$|The {{market share}} of plug-in {{electric}} vehicles (PEVs) has been increasing {{in the last years}} which comes along with a raising demand for public charging stations. While the operation of low-power charging stations (Mode- 3) is far from being profitable, prospects <b>for</b> <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> stations indicate attractive revenues. This is mainly based on a higher workload (shorter charging times), a higher willingness-to-pay of customers and a higher complementary situation compared to home-based charging [1]. Both also serve for different purposes: Slow charging is performed whenever there is an opportunity while <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> will also allow short stops to recharge on long-distance trips (interim charging). In this paper, we investigate the potential for combining interim and opportunity charging at one location in order to increase the utilization and decrease the payback time of public <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> stations. <b>For</b> modeling the operation of Mode- 3 charging stations, we applied the ALADIN model [2] and combine it with results from an optimal allocation of <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> points in Germany (cf. [3]). Results are presented <b>for</b> four <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> stations around Stuttgart, Germany. Our results show that a combination of long-distance and local customers may increase the occupancy rate and therefore the profitability of <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> stations. Yet, the willingness to detour of PEV users, the comparably small additional earnings for charging stations together with a joint optimized location modelling might be analyzed in further work...|$|R
