5|$|In 1568 Sigismund Augustus, who {{had already}} {{embarked}} on a war fleet enlargement program, established the Maritime Commission. A conflict with the City of Gdańsk (Danzig), which felt that its monopolistic trade position was threatened, ensued. In 1569 Royal Prussia had its legal autonomy largely taken away, and in 1570 Poland's supremacy over Danzig and the Polish King's authority over the Baltic <b>shipping</b> <b>trade</b> were regulated and received statutory recognition (Karnkowski's Statutes).|$|E
5|$|Manchester Liners was a cargo and {{passenger}} shipping company founded in 1898, based in Manchester, England. The line pioneered the regular passage of ocean-going vessels along the Manchester Ship Canal. Its main sphere of operation was the transatlantic <b>shipping</b> <b>trade,</b> {{but the company}} also operated services to the Mediterranean. All of the line's vessels were registered in the Port of Manchester, and many were lost to enemy action during the First and Second World Wars.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath's {{prospects}} originally {{revolved around}} the harbour. The original harbour was constructed and maintained by the abbot within the terms of an agreement between the burgesses and John Gedy, the abbot in 1394 AD. This {{gave way to a}} more commodious port in 1725, which in turn was enlarged and improved in 1839, when the sea wall, quay walls and breakwater were added to the old inner harbour, at a cost of £58,000. Arbroath became a major port for the coastal <b>shipping</b> <b>trade</b> and in 1846, there were 89 Arbroath registered vessels, totalling 9,100 gross tons. In the same year, 599 vessels docked at Arbroath, 56 from foreign ports (mainly Baltic ports) with the remaining 543 employed on the coastal trade. Bark, flax, hemp, hides, oak and fir timber, and guano for manure, groceries from London, and numerous articles of Baltic produce were imported via Arbroath, with manufactured goods (mainly sailcloth) exported via Arbroath.|$|E

5|$|At the Battle of Köse Dağ in 1242, the Mongol hordes {{broke the}} Seljuk hegemony in Anatolia. Alanya was then {{subject to a}} series of invasions from Anatolian beyliks. Lusignans from Cyprus briefly {{overturned}} the then ruling Hamidid dynasty in 1371. The Karamanids sold the city in 1427 for 5,000 gold coins to the Mamluks of Egypt for a period before General Gedik Ahmed Pasha in 1471 incorporated it into the growing Ottoman Empire. The city was made a capital of a local sanjak in the eyalet of Içel. The Ottomans extended their rule in 1477 when they brought the main <b>shipping</b> <b>trade,</b> lumber, then mostly done by Venetians, under the government monopoly. On September 6, 1608, the city rebuffed a naval attack by the Order of Saint Stephen from the Republic of Venice.|$|E
5|$|Bridgwater was {{incorporated}} by charter of Edward IV (1468), confirmed in 1554, 1586, 1629 and 1684. Parliamentary representation as a borough constituency began in 1295 and continued until the Reform Act of 1870, {{when the original}} borough constituency was disenfranchised for corruption. From 4 July 1870 the town {{was incorporated}} within the county constituency of West Somerset. When Parliamentary seats were redistributed for the 1885 general election, a new county division of Bridgwater was created. A variety of markets were granted to the town during the Middle Ages including a Midsummer fair (on 24 June), one {{at the beginning of}} Lent was added in 1468, and one at Michaelmas. The importance of these markets and fairs for the sale of wool and wine, and later of cloth, declined after medieval times. The <b>shipping</b> <b>trade</b> of the port revived after the construction of the new dock in 1841, and corn and timber have been imported for centuries.|$|E
5|$|Land {{reclamation}} schemes, {{especially those}} by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 {{just to the}} west of Cley, led to the silting up of the Glaven shipping channel and relocation of Cley's wharf. Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem, and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley. In an attempt to halt the decline, Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had been lost. The population stagnated, and the value of all property decreased sharply. Blakeney's <b>shipping</b> <b>trade</b> benefited from the silting up of its nearby rival, and in 1817 the channel to the Haven was deepened to improve access. Packet ships ran to Hull and London from 1840, but this trade declined as ships became too large for the harbour.|$|E

5|$|Peter the Great, {{recognizing}} {{the political and}} economical importance of the peninsula, promoted its industries and commerce; however, the region fell into neglect after St.Petersburg was founded in 1703 {{and most of the}} <b>shipping</b> <b>trade</b> shifted there. In 1732, large deposits of silver in native form were discovered on Medvezhy Island in the Kandalaksha Gulf and copper, silver, and gold deposits were found in the lower reaches of the Ponoy River. However, despite the efforts ongoing for the next two centuries, there was no commercial success. At the end of the 18th century, the local population learned the practice of peat production from the Norwegians and started using peat for heating. Timber cutting industry developed in the region {{at the end of the}} 19th century; mostly in Kovda and Umba.|$|E
5|$|The town grew rapidly {{during the}} {{industrial}} revolution as urbanisation took place and the town became an area of mercantile prosperity and overcrowded poverty. At {{the turn of the}} 19th century, nine out of ten workers were engaged in harbour activities, but as the century progressed ships became too large for the shallow harbour and the port lost business to the deep water ports at Liverpool, Southampton and Plymouth. Poole's first railway station opened in Hamworthy in 1847 and later extended to the centre of Poole in 1872, effectively ending the port's busy coastal <b>shipping</b> <b>trade.</b> The beaches and landscape of southern Dorset and south-west Hampshire began to attract tourists during the 19th century and the villages to the east of Poole began to grow and merge until the seaside resort of Bournemouth emerged. Although Poole did not become a resort like many of its neighbours, it continued to prosper as the rapid expansion of Bournemouth created a large demand for goods manufactured in Poole.|$|E

Louisville also had a free black population, among whom some managed to acquire property. Washington Spradling, freed from slavery in 1814, became a barber. By the 1850s, he owned real estate valued at $30,000. With its agriculture, <b>shipping</b> <b>trade</b> and industry, and slave markets, Louisville was a city that shared in cultures of both the agricultural South and the industrial North.|$|E

50|$|Historically, the {{composition}} of the crew on UK ships was diverse. This was a characteristic of the extant of the <b>shipping</b> companies <b>trade,</b> the extent of the British Empire and the availability of crew in different ports. One ship might have a largely all British crew, while another might have a crew composed of many Indians, Chinese or African sailors. Crews from outside Britain were usually drawn from areas in which the <b>ship</b> <b>traded,</b> so Far East <b>trading</b> <b>ships</b> had either Singapore or Hong Kong crews, banana boats had West Indian crews, <b>ships</b> <b>trading</b> to West Africa and Southern Africa had African crews and <b>ships</b> <b>trading</b> to the Indian Ocean (including East Africa) had crews from the Indian subcontinent. Crews made up of recruits from Britain itself were commonly used on <b>ships</b> <b>trading</b> across the North Atlantic, to South America and to Australia and New Zealand. Traditionally and still now, the ships crew is run by the Bosun, as overseen by a responsible Deck Officer, usually the Chief Mate. A ship may also have different sub-departments, such as the galley, radio department or hospitality services, overseen by a Chief Cook, Radio Officer or Chief Steward. Many of these roles have now changed, as ships crews have become smaller in commercial shipping. On most ships the Radio department has disappeared, along with the Radio Officer (colloquially known as 'sparks') replaced by changes in technology and the requirement under the STCW Convention for Deck Officers to hold individual certification in the GMDSS System. Electro-technical Officers (ETO) also serve aboard some ships and are trained to fix and maintain the more complex systems.|$|R

Shipping grew rapidly from the mid-1740s until the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), reflecting in part {{the success of the}} Bourbons in bringing illicit trade under control. With the loosening of trade controls after the Seven Years' War, <b>shipping</b> <b>trade</b> within the empire once again began to expand, reaching an extraordinary rate of growth in the 1780s.|$|E
25|$|The war {{had removed}} Bermuda's primary trading partners, the American colonies, from the empire, and dealt a harsh blow to Bermuda's {{merchant}} <b>shipping</b> <b>trade.</b> This also suffered {{due to the}} deforestation of Bermuda, {{as well as the}} advent of metal ships and steam propulsion, for which it did not have raw materials. During the course of the following War of 1812, the primary market for Bermuda's salt disappeared as the Americans developed their own sources. Control of the Turks had passed to the Bahamas in 1819.|$|E
25|$|Åland's {{economy is}} heavily {{dominated}} by <b>shipping,</b> <b>trade</b> and tourism.
