40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} whether <b>specialist</b> <b>producers</b> of Irish cereals were allocating land efficiently in a mean-variance sense during the 1993 - 2002 time period. We then expand {{the model to}} examine the potential implications on the land allocation decision of the 2002 EU Commission’s proposed mid-term reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. One-year ahead rolling forecasts of conditional moments of Irish cereal prices are generated using a multivariate autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic model. These forecasts are used to construct expected efficient frontiers for each year between 1993 and 2002. Our findings indicate that in every year <b>specialist</b> <b>producers</b> of Irish cereals were allocating land efficiently ex ante. We also show that the proposed introduction of decoupled payments will change the efficient frontier facing Irish cereal producers and probably induce producers to allocate more land to the higher returning yet relatively riskier wheat crop.

40|$|This paper uses {{a dynamic}} general {{equilibrium}} model based on corner solutions to formalize the classical theory of investment and capital which considers investment to be a vehicle for developing {{a high level of}} division of labor in roundabout productive activities. If it takes time for a <b>specialist</b> <b>producer</b> of tractors to learn the right method in producing commercially viable tractors, specialization in producing tractors is infeasible in the absence of investment in terms of consumption goods which are consumed by the <b>specialist</b> <b>producer</b> of tractor before he can sell tractors. If specialized learning by doing can speed up accumulation of professional knowledge so that roundabout productive machines becomes cheap, such investment for increasing the level of division of labor in roundabout productive activities will speed up economic growth. Due to the tradeoff between economies of specialized learning by doing and transaction costs, the model can be used to investigate the effects of a change in the transaction cost coefficient, which can be affected by policy, the legal system, and urbanization, on the evolution of division of labor, on real interest rates, and on saving rate.

50|$|Delft Jewelry is {{the generic}} name for jewelry {{featuring}} Dutch (Netherlands) miniature Delftware medallions or brooch panels {{in a silver}} setting. Delft jewelry includes necklaces, pendants, earrings, brooches, bracelets, rings, and cufflinks. The Delft panels are usually made of pottery and decorated with a blue and white windmill landscape. The silver setting often has the form of silver filigree. Delft jewelry {{has been made in}} the Netherlands since c.1879. It flourished especially in the decades after WW2 as a result of demand from the Dutch tourist industry. That era saw the emergence of three <b>specialist</b> <b>producers</b> of Delft medallions.

40|$|Within Colombia {{significant}} amounts of seed are produced and exported of the perennial tropical grasses; Brachiaria decumbens, Cenchus ciliaris, Dichanthium aristatum, Hyparrhenia rufa, Melinis minutiflora, and Panicum maximum. Small amounts of the perennial legume Pueraria phaseoloides are produced. There are very few seed producers in Colombia in the conventional sense. This apparent anomaly is {{explained by the fact}} that seed is natural by-product in some grazing regions which is harvested from pastures by manual contract labour and then traded between merchants, generally without any mechanical processing.

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of {{outsourcing}} {{in which there is}} market power in one factor market (labor) and no market power in a second factor market (capital). There are two intermediate goods: one labor-intensive and the other capital-intensive. We show there is always outsourcing in the market allocation when a friction limiting outsourcing is not too big. The key factor underlying the result is that labor demand is more elastic, the greater the labor share. Integrated plants pay higher wages than the <b>specialist</b> <b>producers</b> of labor-intensive intermediates. We derive conditions under which there are multiple equilibria that vary in the degree of outsourcing. Across these equilibria, wages are lower the greater the degree of outsourcing. Wages fall when outsourcing increases in response to a decline in the outsourcing friction. ...|$|R

Drawing upon {{the literature on}} the so-called sphere packing problem in geometry, it is shown that as the number of dimensions increases, more space for specialists opens up. This yields an explanation of the emergence, in many industries, of small producers next to large ones, in a dual market structure, which forms an alternative to the interpretation of "resource partitioning" theory in the sociological literature on population ecology (Hannan and Freeman 1977, Freeman and Hannan 1983, Carroll and Hannon 1995, Peli 1997).
