Field induced dipoles, reorientation of permanent dipoles, protonation and deprotonation of protein residues, larger scale reorganization of ionized side-chains and water molecules, both within the interior and on the surface of the protein, are all examples of how complicated the assignment of permittivity is. In MD simulations, where all the charges, dipoles, and field induced atomic dipoles are treated explicitly then it is suggested that a dielectric value of 1 is appropriate. However, in reduced-particle ion simulation programs, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>ours,</b> where the protein, membrane, and water are continuum backgrounds and treated implicitly, and on top of that, the ion motion takes place on the same time-scale as the protein’s response to its presence, it is very difficult to assign the dielectric coefficients. In fact, changing the dielectric coefficients could easily alter the channel characteristics, such as ion permeation and selectivity The assignment of dielectric coefficient for water is another key issue. The water molecules inside ion channels could be very ordered due to tapered size of the pore, which is often lined with highly charged residues, or hydrogen bond formation between water molecules and protein. As a result, the dielectric constant of water inside an ion channel could be quite different from the value under bulk conditions. To make the matter even more complicated, the dielectric coefficients of water inside nanopores is not necessarily an isotropic scalar value, but an anisotropic tensor having different values in different directions.|$|E

[...] While he acknowledged that his view was heresy, Lê Duẩn insisted that Vietnam was in a unique situation; [...] "It seems that no country so far in history has been in a situation <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>ours.</b> We must lead the peasantry and agriculture immediately to socialism, without waiting for a developed industry, though we know very well that without the strong impact of industry, agriculture cannot achieve large-scale production and new relations of agriculture cannot be consolidated... To proceed from small-scale production to large-scale production is a new one." [...] According to Lê Duẩn the key to socialism was not mechanisation and industrialisation, but a new division of labour. He also believed that cooperatives {{did not need to be}} autarkic, but rather [...] "organically connected, through the process of production itself, with other cooperatives and with the state economic sector." [...] Vietnam could achieve this through state intervention and control. He saw the economy as one whole directed by the state and not many parts intertwined.|$|E

Sin bases itself in hopelessness, which can take on two forms: presumption and despair. [...] "Presumption is a premature, selfwilled anticipation of the fulfillment of what we hope for from God. Despair is the premature, arbitrary anticipation of the non-fulfillment of what we hope for from God." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{established}} Resistance groups soon {{made contact}} with the maquis, providing them with para-military training. Frenay later remembered: We established contact with them through our departmental and regional chiefs. Usually these little maquis voluntarily followed our instructions, in return for which they expected food, arms and ammunition [...] [...] [...] It {{seemed to me that}} these groups, which were now in hiding all over the French mountain country, might well be transformed into an awesome combat weapon. The maquisards were all young, all volunteers, all itching for action [...] [...] [...] It was up to use to organize them and give them a sense of their role in the struggle. The terrain of central and southern France with its forests, mountains, and shrubland were ideal for hiding and unless the authorities were prepared to commit thousands of men to hunt the maquis down, it was quite possible to evade authority in this landscape. The Germans simply did not have the spare men-power for such operations and instead sent spotter planes to find the maquis, who provided that they were careful about concealing their fires could usually avoid aerial detection. The only other way of breaking up the maquis bands was to send in a spy, which was highly dangerous work as the maquisards would summarily execute any infiltrator working for the Germans or Vichy who was exposed. Joining the young men fleeing the service with the STO were others targeted by the Reich like Jews, Spanish Republican refugees, and Allied airmen shot down over France. One maquis band in the Cévennes region consisted of German communists who had fought in the Spanish Civil War who fled to France in 1939. A striking aspect of the maquis was unlike the urban-based resistance groups that emerged in 1940-42 who took political names like Combat, Liberté or Libération, the maquis bands chose apolitical names like the names of animals <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>Ours,</b> Loup, Tigre, Lion, Puma, Rhinocéros and Eléphant; or names of people like the Maquis Bernard, the Maquis Socrate, the Maquis Henri Bourgogne; or one maquis band whose leader was a doctor, hence the name Maquis le Doc.|$|E
