2500|$|In {{the latter}} part of his career as a BBC {{producer}} Simpson frequently clashed with the management of the organisation. In the 1970s he was one of those– Hans Keller and Deryck Cooke were others– who started the (unsuccessful) revolt against the report Broadcasting in the Seventies and its plan for [...] "generic broadcasting" [...] (i.e. separate networks for pop, classical and speech). A decade later Simpson was energetic in his opposition to a cost-cutting reorganisation that ultimately proposed the decommissioning of five of the eleven BBC orchestras. During the ensuing musicians' strike (which caused the cancellation of the first several weeks of the 1980 BBC Promenade Concerts) Simpson chose to disregard BBC <b>staff</b> <b>regulations</b> and discuss the matter with a national newspaper; he then resigned from the Corporation, publicly alleging a [...] "degeneration of traditional BBC values in the scramble for ratings" [...] (Hans Keller later described these criticisms as [...] "demonstrable fact") [...] Had Simpson remained silent for a few more months he {{would have been able to}} retire with a full pension, but his feeling was that such a course would have compromised his principles. Abominating the ethos of Thatcherite Britain, in 1986 he moved to Ireland, settling on Tralee Bay in Kerry. In 1991 he suffered a severe stroke during an English lecture tour, which caused damage to the thalamus and left him in debilitating pain for the remaining six years of his life. [...] He died in Tralee in 1997.|$|E

40|$|This article investigates how {{a change}} in minimum nurse <b>staffing</b> <b>regulation</b> for California skilled nursing {{facilities}} (SNFs) affects nurse employment and how induced changes in nurse staffing affect patient mortality. In 2000, legislation increased the minimum nurse staffing standard and altered the calculation of nurse staffing, which created incentives to shift employment to lower skilled nurse labor. SNFs constrained by the new regulation increase absolute and relative hours worked by the lowest skilled type of nurse. Using this regulation change to instrument for measured nurse staffing levels, it is determined that increases in nurse staffing reduce on-site SNF patient mortality.

The arrival of additional members has put an additional stress on the governance of the Institutions, and increased significantly overheads (for example, through the multiplication of official languages). Furthermore, there is a division of staff, since the very same day of the enlargement was chosen to enact an in-depth reform of the <b>Staff</b> <b>Regulation,</b> which was intended to bring significant savings in administrative costs. As a result, employment conditions (career & retirement perspectives) worsened for officials recruited after that date.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three separate papers studying policy relevant questions in labor economics. The goal of these studies is to understand the welfare effects from various government regulation and programs. Chapter 1 investigates how child support income affects household resources for single mothers with at least some college education. I determine that child support income promotes single mother financial independence by reducing welfare participation, decreasing cohabitation rates, and increase labor supply. Chapter 2 examines how a change in minimum nurse <b>staffing</b> <b>regulation</b> affects nurse employment and patient mortality in California nursing homes. My results show that regulation induced increases in nurse staffing cause patient mortality to fall by 4. 6 %. Chapter 3 determines whether child support enforcement reform coming from the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 {{has an impact on}} rates of single motherhood in the United States.
