5|$|Creating {{a native}} pet {{industry}} in Australia related to quolls could aid in their conservation. However, concerns exist about this methodology {{in regards to}} animal husbandry, conservation benefits, and other issues. Some <b>scientists</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> keeping quolls as pets could aid in their long-term conservation, but {{further research is needed}} on this topic to conclude whether this is true or false.|$|E
5|$|There is {{debate about}} {{the exact nature of}} phreatomagmatic eruptions, and some <b>scientists</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> fuel-coolant {{reactions}} may be more critical to the explosive nature than thermal contraction. Fuel coolant reactions may fragment the volcanic material by propagating stress waves, widening cracks and increasing surface area that ultimately leads to rapid cooling and explosive contraction-driven eruptions.|$|E
5|$|One Velociratoptor mongoliensis skull bears two {{parallel}} rows of small punctures that match the spacing {{and size of}} Velociraptor teeth. <b>Scientists</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the wound was likely inflicted by another Velociraptor during a fight. Further, because the fossil bone {{shows no sign of}} healing near the bite wounds, the injury probably killed it. Another specimen, found with the bones of an azhdarchid pterosaur within its stomach cavity, was carrying or recovering from an injury sustained to its ribs. From evidence on the pterosaur bones, which were devoid of pitting or deformations from digestion, the Velociraptor died shortly after, possibly from the earlier injury.|$|E

5|$|Although the camas {{pocket gopher}} is {{fiercely}} defensive when cornered, {{it may become}} tame in captivity. While population trends are generally stable, threats to the species' survival include urbanization, habitat conversion for agricultural use and active attempts at eradication with trapping and poisons. It is prey for raptors and carnivorous mammals, and host to several parasitic arthropods and worms. <b>Scientists</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the gopher's evolutionary history was disrupted when the Missoula Floods washed over the Willamette Valley {{at the end of}} the last ice age. The floods almost completely inundated its geographic range, which may have caused a genetic bottleneck as survivors repopulated the region after the waters receded.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the highly}} {{specialized}} mandibles, <b>scientists</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the ants exhibited habits no longer seen in extant ants. The highly movable head suggests that mobility {{was an important}} factor for them (probably for feeding behavior), and the rugose projections {{may have played a}} major role in nest excavation because the mandibles would have prevented such activity. Zigrasimecia most likely interacted with the extinct ant genus Gerontoformica through conflict and probably shared some of their ecological niches. The mandibles of these ants were probably used for mechanical interactions with food, and they may also have served as traps for potential arthropod prey such as mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator.|$|E
5|$|Later {{studies showed}} that 5–10% of the viewers had mild {{symptoms}} that did not need hospital treatment. Twelve thousand children who did not get sent to hospital by ambulance reported mild symptoms of illness; however, their symptoms more closely resembled mass hysteria than a grand mal seizure. A study following 103 patients over {{three years after the}} event found that most of them had no further seizures. <b>Scientists</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the flashing lights triggered photosensitive seizures in which visual stimuli such as flashing lights can cause altered consciousness. Although approximately 1 in 4,000 people are susceptible to these types of seizures, the number of people affected by this Pokémon episode was unprecedented.|$|E

5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{originated in}} the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, a fault noted for earthquakes of moderate magnitude. Faulting in the area is strike-slip-oriented probably because of the Alabama-New York Lineament, which runs adjacent to the fault. Several <b>scientists</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the small earthquakes from the zone highlight the reactivation of deep, ancient faults. Alabama has seen roughly 20 earthquakes {{since the beginning of}} the 20th century. The earthquakes have been moderate, never reaching above magnitude 5.1, and tend to cause damage only near their epicenters while reaching areas much further away. Major events include those in 1916, 1997, and 2003. Despite the lack of powerful seismic events in Alabama, earthquakes from nearby fault zones, including the New Madrid Seismic Zone, pose a serious threat to infrastructure. Even an earthquake similar in size to the 1916Irondaleevent today could damage thousands of buildings and cause up to $1billion in damage.|$|E

25|$|The {{most notable}} cell types of sponges are the goblet-shaped cells called choanocytes, so named for their {{similarity}} to choanoflagellates. The similarities {{between these two}} cells types makes <b>scientists</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> choanoflagellates are the sister taxa to metazoa. The flagella of these cells are what drive the water movement through the sponge body. The cell body of choanocytes is what is responsible for nutrient absorption. In some species these cells can develop into gametes.|$|E

25|$|A key {{tenet of}} NKS {{is that the}} simpler the system, the more likely a version of it will recur {{in a wide variety}} of more {{complicated}} contexts. Therefore, NKS argues that systematically exploring the space of simple programs will lead to a base of reusable knowledge. However, many <b>scientists</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> of all possible parameters, only some actually occur in the universe. For instance, of all possible permutations of the symbols making up an equation, most will be essentially meaningless. NKS has also been criticized for asserting that the behavior of simple systems is somehow representative of all systems.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>scientists</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the Himalayas are a {{major factor}} in the current ice age, because these {{mountains}} have increased Earth's total rainfall and therefore the rate at which carbon dioxide is washed out of the atmosphere, decreasing the greenhouse effect. The Himalayas' formation started about 70 million years ago when the Indo-Australian Plate collided with the Eurasian Plate, and the Himalayas are still rising by about 5nbsp&mm per year because the Indo-Australian plate is still moving at 67nbsp&mm/year. The history of the Himalayas broadly fits the long-term decrease in Earth's average temperature since the mid-Eocene, 40 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|While common ancestry with cynodonts (and, thus, mammals) {{accounts}} for many similarities between these groups, some <b>scientists</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> other similarities {{may be better}} attributed to convergent evolution, such as {{the loss of the}} postorbital bar in some forms, a mammalian phalangeal formula, and some form of a secondary palate in most taxa (see below). Therocephalians and cynodonts both survived the Permian-Triassic mass extinction; but, while therocephalians soon became extinct, cynodonts underwent rapid diversification. Therocephalians experienced a decreased rate of cladogenesis, meaning that few new groups appeared after the extinction. Most Triassic therocephalian lineages originated in the Late Permian, and lasted for only {{a short period of time}} in the Triassic.|$|E
25|$|According to polls, most {{computer}} <b>scientists</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> P≠NP.

These algorithms were sought long before the concept of NP-completeness was even defined (Karp's 21 NP-complete problems, among the first found, were all well-known existing problems at the time they were shown to be NP-complete). Furthermore, the result P = NP would imply many other startling results that are currently believed to be false, such as NP = co-NP and P = PH.|$|E
