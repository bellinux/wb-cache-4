25|$|Because the Moke's A-Series engine, {{manual gearbox}} and {{suspension}} are {{identical to those}} of a standard Mini (which was still in production up to October 2000), most spare parts are still readily available. The Moke has no chassis, so the wheels, brake assemblies and suspension are attached to front and rear <b>subframes</b> bolted straight onto the monocoque shell, just as with a standard Mini. Mokes tend to require much structural maintenance {{if they are to}} stay in good running order.|$|E
2500|$|The Lexus LFA's {{frame is}} made from an {{in-house}} designed and manufactured carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) center monocoque with aluminum front and rear <b>subframes.</b> The <b>subframes,</b> which can be removed and replaced minimizing potential repair costs, are joined to the monocoque using a newly developed aluminum flanged collar designed to create a stronger joint. According to the manufacturer, {{the quality of the}} CRFP material matches that of aeronautical grades and is woven by a laser monitored circular loom, one of only two in the world. Overall 65% of the vehicle's total body mass is CFRP material while the remaining 35% is aluminum. Manufacturer data indicates that the use of CFRP saves [...] over equivalent aluminum materials.|$|E

2500|$|While similar Rogue and American models had drum brakes, the SC package {{came with}} front discs, a heavier sway bar, {{as well as}} {{strengthened}} drive train and body components. These included connectors between {{the front and rear}} <b>subframes.</b> The rear end used staggered (fore and aft) rear shock absorbers to eliminate wheel hop (axle wrap) under extreme acceleration conditions with leaf spring suspensions. The staggered shocks required a special plate riveted in the trunk pan, as well as brackets for the subframe end of upper torque links. Other body modifications differentiating all Hurst SC Ramblers from regular hardtop Ramblers included rolling back front and rear wheel openings to allow for larger tires. American Motors called on Hurst to help develop a vehicle for the racing market. Because of stock class rules, a minimum of 500 identical vehicles had to be produced and sold. This led to the SC Hurst Rambler, (SC) meaning [...] "Super Car". This vehicle is commonly referred to as a [...] "Scrambler", although Jeeps later used the SCRAMBLER name.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to use a hybrid {{frequency}} response function–based substructuring synthesis method to predict the structure-borne noise of a vehicle frame resulting due to excitation by the engine and to develop a noise reduction method for optimizing the <b>subframe</b> model. The finite element models of the <b>subframe</b> were first verified by comparing their natural frequencies and frequency response functions with those of the real <b>subframe</b> models. Several substructures were then defined and the vehicle interior noises were predicted using the hybrid frequency response function–based substructuring synthesis method. Based on the prediction results, different target frequency ranges were selected, and different methods for optimizing the <b>subframe</b> model to reduce noise were investigated within the selected frequency ranges. Finally, the <b>subframe</b> modes within the selected frequency ranges were analyzed and new noise reduction models were developed by modifying the thickness of parts of the original <b>subframe...</b>|$|R

30|$|The RM block {{has three}} main functions: first, route {{advertisement}} is for exchanging route information among the devices. Using this function, the devices can discover their neighbors. Second, join is for selecting a parent device and requesting to join it. Finally, slot allocation is for assigning a TDMA slot within the <b>subframe</b> to the children. Slot allocation is performed when a device receives a join request (JREQ) {{from a child}} candidate device. The SFM block has two main functions: <b>subframe</b> advertisement is for exchanging the <b>subframe</b> information among the devices, by which each device can maintain channel occupancy status of its neighbors within the interference range. <b>Subframe</b> collision resolution is for avoiding {{the selection of a}} duplicate <b>subframe.</b> When two or more devices within interference range select the same <b>subframe,</b> this function is performed. The JRR block has two main functions: neighbor discovery is for collecting the neighbor's information using a HELLO message when the device is newly turned on or detects a link error. Link status detection is for detecting the occurrence of a link failure. The RMH block is for classifying and processing received packets. According to the kind of packet received, RMH calls the appropriate function. In addition, the JRS subsystem maintains multiple data structures, namely JRS information base (JRSIB), which includes a routing table, a <b>subframe</b> table, and a child table. The aforementioned function blocks interact with these tables. In the following sections, we present detailed descriptions of each block.|$|R
