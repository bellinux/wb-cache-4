40|$|In {{the era of}} {{international}} peacebuilding, how does a rebel group seek to legitimate its rule once it is in power? This thesis is primarily concerned with this question. By applying legitimation theory (Beetham 1991; Chabal & Daloz 1999) in a descriptive, exploratory case study, the thesis analyzes how the <b>Sudan</b> People <b>s</b> Liberation Movement (SPLM) seeks to consolidate its rule during the current peace process in southern Sudan. The process {{is assumed to be}} dependent on internal as well as external factors. With its multiethnic composition, complicated and war-torn history, as well as a generally low level of development, southern Sudan is considered a difficult case in terms of peacebuilding. SPLM emerged from <b>Sudan</b> <b>s</b> second civil war (1983 - 2005) as the South s main rebel group, but several local groups complicate the situation. Intergroup grievances in the region are considerable. The main findings indicate that SPLM has the willingness to address the issues at stake but lack the institutional capacity to do so. Also, maintaining and further legitimating their power are dependent on external parties, and the latter s interests diverge to a considerable extent. Of particular concern {{is the role of the}} National Congress Party (NCP), SPLM s Islamist senior partner in the national government, which seems to undermine or simply ignore the parts of the peace agreement that seriously challenge its power. The findings provide some nuances for existing theories about peacebuilding (Doyle & Sambanis 2000; Paris 2004) and civil war resolution (Walter 2002). Most importantly, though, they indicate that legitimation theory can fill a void in peace research concerning local actors. By encompassing other theories into one comprehensive framework, legitimation theory can provide a greater overview of the overall peacebuilding picture...|$|R

40|$|Downscaling of {{seasonal}} hindcasts over East Africa with the regional climate model (RCM) COSMO-CLM (CCLM), {{forced by the}} global climate model (GCM) and MPI-ESM, is evaluated. The simulations are done for five months (May to September) for a ten-year period (2000 – 2009), with the evaluation performed only for June to September. The dry years, 2002 and 2009, and the wet years, 2006 and 2007, are well captured by the models. By using ground based and satellite gridded observation data for evaluation {{it is found that}} both COSMO-CLM and MPI-ESM overestimate June to September precipitation over the Ethiopian highlands and in parts of the lowland with respect to all reference datasets.

Fecundity rate was significantly higher in the clam shrimps, but the longer life span of the anostracans resulted in total fecundity being not significantly different (P > 0. 05). Fecundity variables were not found to differ significantly (P > 0. 05) among three successive periods of the reproductive period for any of the species tested. The smaller mean egg size in spinicaudatans (182 +/- 40 mum), in comparison with the fairy shrimps (255 +/- 41 mum), might be explained in terms of size constraints rather than by a difference in ecological strategy. Egg size was furthermore significantly different (P < 0. 05) between all pairs of species (except between the clam shrimps Leptestheria aegyptiaca and Eocyzicus klunzingeri) and even between different populations of Streptocephalus proboscideus.

40|$|Most of the {{researches}} on peace agreements {{conclude that}} powersharing arrangements included in these are {{mostly to the}} detriment of longterm democratic transformation. The basic argument of these studies is that peace deals consolidate mainly the power of the signatories {{to the detriment of}} other major political forces.

The {{analyses were performed}} on plant material samples taken from the first cutting, when plants were in the beginning phase of tasseling. The following morphologic traits were studied: plant height, number of leaves per plant, stem leaf weight and mean stem weight. Additionally, their direct and indirect effect on dependent variable green biomass yield was analyzed, for which path coefficients were calculated. This method enables more quality and full insight into relations existing among the studied traits, more precise establishment of cause-effect connections among them, {{as well as to}} separate direct from indirect effects of any particular trait on dependent variable, being biomass yield in this case. The analysis of phenotypic coefficients revealed differences in direct and indirect effect of certain traits on dependent variable.

Forage sorghum had the largest leaf weight per plant (49. 05 g), while interspecies hybrid had the highest mean stem weight (80. 798 g). Variations of these morphologic traits among species were found to be significant and very significant. Morphologic traits - stem height and weight significantly affected sorghum green biomass yield.

40|$|Assessment of {{effectiveness}} of Chinese aid in competence building and financing development in <b>Sudan</b> by <b>S.</b> Nour [abstract] This paper discusses {{the effectiveness of}} Chinese aid for competence building and financing development in Sudan using new primary data at the micro level. We find that Chinese aid and loans to Sudan caused mixed positive-negative impacts. The positive impact is competence building and providing alternative complementary sources of finance to complement domestic capital and financing development projects; the negative impact is increasing Sudanese debts to China. We find that the effectiveness of Chinese aid to Sudan is undermined by offering aid tied to trade, FDI {{and the importance of}} oil to the Chinese economy. Despite the global economic crisis, China has continued to offer tied aid to maintain access to oil in Sudan. Despite a long period of economic sanctions, Sudan was able to grow thanks to the robust and increasing intensification of special economic relations with China which relaxed the development finance constraint. From the perspective of new approaches to financing development, our findings imply that even when a country is facing binding political and economic sanctions, it can still proceed with competence building and finance a high growth strategy if it is endowed with natural resources and a partner that is in need of such resources. In addition to aid in the form of financial capital, Chinese aid and development assistance include technical assistance in the form of scholarships for training and education. The outcome of Chinese aid directed towards capacity building in Sudan implies that the majority of scholarships provided for specialization fields of Engineering, followed by Science and related fields, and finally Arts, Social Science and related fields respectively, and provided for PhD degree, followed by MSc degree, research and training respectively over the period (1999 - 2013).

The oxidation reactions promoted discoloration from 65 % to 95 % of Sudan III at 1 × 10 − 4 molL− 1 and generation of 7. 6 × 10 − 7 molL− 1 to 0. 31 × 10 − 4 molL− 1 of aniline, o-anisidine, 2 -methoxi- 5 -methylaniline, 4 -aminobiphenyl, 4, 4 ′-oxydianiline; 4, 4 ′-diaminodiphenylmethane and 2, 6 -dimethylaniline.

40|$|Water {{has been}} {{declared}} a human right by the United Nations, thus urging countries who have ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to ensure supply with drinking water for their populations 1. However, supply of drinking water in developing countries underlies different constraints than those met in industrialized countries. An example is the dependency on treatment chemicals that may pose problems in these countries regarding importation and distribution 2. In pioneering work in the Darfur region (<b>Sudan)</b> <b>S.</b> A. A. Jahn has instructed rural people how to use local natural coagulants, {{that had been used}} traditionally by parts of the population, for the preparation of water for household use with special emphasis on the seeds of the Moringa oleifera tree 3. The implementation of water supply for the population on the other hand demands centralized water treatment for villages and cities and thus traditional techniques will reach their limitations. The present work tries to identify and characterise the coagulating principle present in the seeds and press-cake of M. oleifera, in order to produce quantities of a standardized coagulant {{that could be used in}} small treatment works. Therefore, different extraction methods, reported in the literature, are compared regarding extraction efficiency and composition. All extracts contained a large proteinaceous moiety, which differed from proteins described before as Mo 2. 1 (flocculating proteins 4) in the way that two proteins were detected under reducing conditions, both not co-migrating with a synthetic protein having the amino acid sequence of Mo 2. 1. Moreover a different group of proteins with higher molecular weight was only present during the first two days of storage of the liquid extract. An optimized extraction procedure is presented, resulting in a total protein yield of 40 g/L. Separation of proteinaceous components present in the seed and press-cake extracts lead to the determination of relative molecular masses of two protein components present (4 and 8 kDa) which form a 12 kDa heterodimer under non-reducing conditions, such as those found in the raw extracts. Further evidence is presented that the number of different proteins present in the extracts using the reported techniques may be an artifact due to sample degradation, oxidation and reaction with non-proteinaceous substances present in the extracts. The presence of glucosinolates and of their derivatives that belong to the reactive group of isothiocyanates was show in the extracts of M. oleifera seeds and press-cake, thus increasing the risk of protein stability problems during storage of the potential product. Furthermore, a method for protein isolation which reduces interference of isothiocyanates has been developed for extraction from M. oleifera. In order to compare the coagulating activities of different components present in fractions after separation of the seed extracts a miniaturized assay has been developed. Highest coagulating activities were found for the 8 kDa protein chain. Partial sequencing of different preparations of the 8 kDa chain indicated the presence of several forms of the protein having slight sequence differences. The protein chain is very similar to the published Mo 2. 1 protein, but appears to contain 70 amino acid residues instead of the 60 residues reported for Mo 2. 1. These results clearly indicate that the original protein Mo 2. 1 is only a fragment of the proteins present in extracts from M. oleifera seeds. Experiments for pilot scale production were conducted involving extraction of the coagulant from M. oleifera press cake. Different possible technologies for the preparation of coagulant from M. oleifera press-cake are compared. Difficulties were encountered in solid-liquid separation after initial extraction, due to high solid loads and very slow settling, and during concentration of extracts by ultrafiltration. Alternatively tests for percolation of press-cake were carried out, which resulted in high extraction efficiencies. Finally an extraction process using sequential percolation with two different solvents, in order to separate glucosinolates and proteins is proposed, followed by a precipitating concentration step of the product.

Signs of infection were anorexia, soft faeces, progressive weakness {{and loss of}} wool. The sheep were killed 254 and 269 days after infection. The findings were heavy infiltration of the lamina propria with inflammatory cells, numerous ova in the submucosa, hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue, oedema of the mesenteric lymph nodes, and focal pulmonary oedema and congestion. There were egg granulomas, focal necrosis, schistosomal pigment, fatty change, depletion of glycogen and reduction in the activity of adenosine triphosphatase, succinic tetrazolium reductase and glucose- 6 -phos-phatase in the liver. In one sheep I 330 cercariae penetrated and 700 matured to produce males and females in a 5 : 2 ratio. In the other sheep, about {{one third of the}} cercariae penetrated and matured. The ratio of males to females was 3 : 1.

The model consists of eight structural equations, representing the demand for and supply of export cotton for Egypt, Sudan, Peru and the U. S. The analysis is based on time series data for the period 1950 - 80. The results show that the export price of each country is the major factor in determining the export sales of its cotton. Demand elasticities ranged from - 0. 95 to - 1. 21. Egypt's export price affects the demand for Sudan's cotton, and Sudan's price affects the demand for Egypt's cotton.

40|$|DELAY OF DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF NEW SMEAR POSITIVE PULMONARY TB IN RURAL AREA; GAZIERA STATE, <b>SUDAN</b> Mohammed A. <b>S.</b> *, Bjune G. **, and El Sony A. I. *** *EpiLab, Khartoum, Sudan, MPhil International Community Health, University of Oslo, Norway; **Department of General Practice and Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Norway; *** EpiLab, Khartoum, Sudan. Background: The {{basics of}} TB control {{are based on}} early {{detection}} and treatment of infectious cases. Early detection is controlled by both patient’s and health system’s factors. In this study we explored some of both patient’s and health system’s factors that contributed to longer period of infectiousness of TB. Objectives: The overall goal {{of this study was}} to determine the magnitude of both total delay and total period of TB diagnosis and initiation of anti TB treatment and to investigate the possible contributing factors. Setting: All levels of health services within Gaziera State, Sudan. 77 % of population was rural settled during the last 3 centuries after a past history of nomadic life. The population is multi ethnic and multi cultural. Design: A quantitative cross sectional study during the period 17 th of July 2005 to 11 th of January 2006. Results: Two hundred and sixteen new smear positive pulmonary TB patients were recruited. The mean total diagnostic period was 69. 66 ± 28. 14 days. 87. 5 % delayed for more than 42 days. Risk factors for long mean total diagnostic period were being divorced or widow, family monthly income more than 100 US$, other health providers visited before TBMU and having to pay for services in public health facilities. The mean patient’s period was 36. 6 ± 23. 13 days. 61. 6 % was delayed for more than 1 month. Risk factors for long mean patient’s period were being 25 - 54 years old, being alone in a room in the house, distance more than 30 minutes walk to TBMU and sputum for AFB grade scanty or 1 +. The mean total health system’s period was 33. 05 ± 24. 5 days. 79. 2 % were delayed for more than 2 weeks. The mean other health provider’s period was 29. 1 ± 24. 7 days. 78. 7 % were delayed for more than 9 days. The risk factors for long means total health system’s and other health provider’s period were being of female gender, divorced or widow, students or without income generating activity, family monthly income more than 100 US$, distance between 15 to 30 minutes walk to TBMU, blood investigation performed, more than one other health provider consulted and having to pay full fees or being covered by health insurance to the public health facility. The mean TBMU’s period was 3. 99 ± 1. 6 days. 14. 8 % were delayed for more than 5 days. Risk factors for long mean TBMU’s period were being 25 - 54 years old, living alone in a room in the house, distance between 15 to 30 minutes walk to TBMU and sputum for AFB grade 2 ++. The mean post referral period was 4. 32 ± 6. 87 days. Risk factors for long post referral mean period were being older than 25 years, divorced or widow, higher level of education, rural residence, free access to public health facility and sputum for AFB grade 2 ++. Conclusion: Delay of TB diagnosis and treatment was highly prevalent in this area. Both patients and health system share an equal responsibility. Patient’s factors can modulate health system’s period while health system factors play the same role for patient’s period. For patients, socio demographic factors played a crucial role in modulating the diagnostic period. For the health system, other health provider’s practice toward TB suspect played a role. Economical factors were found to contribute to both periods i. e. health system and patient. More researches to explore socio demographic bases influencing patient’s period should be conducted while coordination between TBMUs and other health providers should be the focus of TB control in the future. Poverty reduction policies would be a crucial factor as a contributor to shorten total diagnostic period. Evaluation of new TB diagnostic tools should put in consideration the overlapping of patient’s and health system’s periods, like post referral period...|$|R
40|$|Peter Browne {{describes}} {{the genesis of}} his book The Longest Journey: Resettling Refugees from Africa, published by UNSW Press, which looks at the evolution of Australia’s refugee resettlement program and the obstacles faced by refugees in Africa IN THE EARLY 1990 s, while {{people in the west}} were debating whether the fall of the Berlin Wall represented, in Francis Fukuyama’s notorious phrase, “the end of history,” many of the countries in the north-east of sub-Saharan Africa were at war or on the verge of conflict. During those years violence continued, intensified or broke out in Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi. In the midst of these countries Kenya, with its long, unpatrolled borders and relatively stable government, was a sanctuary. Between 1990 and 1992 the country’s refugee population grew from fewer than 15, 000 to over 400, 000, stabilising at around {{a quarter of a million}} - the number estimated to be living there still in late 2005. Among the people who fled to Kenya during those years were a Rwandan woman and her two sons. The woman (her name was never revealed in the coverage of the case) was a close relative of the former Rwandan president, Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu politician whose death was the pretext for the genocidal violence in 1994. Two (or three, according to some reports) of her children had been killed in Rwanda, and she had escaped to Uganda with the two younger boys in 2000. When it was clear they were not safe there, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, transferred the family to Nairobi. By early 2002 they were living in a refugee accommodation centre and waiting for a final decision on their application to resettle in Australia. Early one morning in April 2002 the three were attacked as they slept. The boys were killed and their mother badly injured. According to a short report in the Melbourne Age, the family had been scheduled for a medical check the following day as a final step in preparing to leave Kenya. Despite the urgency of their case - Human Rights Watch reported that the family had been attacked before - they had waited over a year for the resettlement process to reach this point. Although the first report in the Kenyan Daily Nation described the attack as a “fight,” the evidence that emerged over the next few days suggests that the sleeping children were sedated and then stabbed. Their mother said that she was woken by two attackers who held her down while they stabbed her repeatedly. Police from the nearby Kilimani station reported no evidence of a break-in; a kitchen knife from the centre, believed to have been used in the attack, was found two days later. Acting on the assumption that the attackers were among the other 180 or more people housed at the centre, the police eventually arrested two men who claimed to be deserters from the Rwandan army. In Canberra, an unnamed official denied that Australia had dragged its feet in dealing with the woman’s request for resettlement. Australia, he added, was one of “only a handful of countries” resettling refugees from that region. According to Human Rights Watch, the case highlighted “the current failure of the UNHCR in Nairobi to provide speedy resettlement for refugees whose lives are at risk. ” Over the previous two years the federal government’s policies towards refugees and asylum seekers had developed into the most contentious issue in Australian politics. The immigration minister, Philip Ruddock, had repeatedly argued that asylum seekers arriving by boat were queue jumpers, taking places from the needier refugees waiting patiently in camps or lined up outside local offices of the UNHCR. Yet here, just a few kilometres from the UNHCR’s Nairobi office and not far from the Australian High Commission, was a compelling example of how the official route by which refugees can settle in Australia is far from orderly, or even safe. So it was surprising that the Age was the only Australian newspaper to report the incident in any detail. The coverage of the attack also highlighted another important fact. For many years Australia has been one of only ten countries accepting refugees through the UNHCR’s resettlement program. (Those ten - the United States, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Ireland and New Zealand - have recently been joined by another group of countries offering smaller quotas.) Judged by the size of its population, Australia now takes more refugees through the program than any other country. The origins of the attack lay in the history and circumstances of an influential and high-profile Rwandan family. But it seemed to me that the details of the case might help to illuminate the strengths and weaknesses of the resettlement process itself. So, with an advance from the magazine Eureka Street to help cover costs, I flew to Kenya in mid 2002 to find out more about the attack and get an idea of what life was like for refugees waiting in Philip Ruddock’s “queue. ” A year later, again writing for Eureka Street, I visited the Kakuma refugee camp in north-western Kenya, near the border with Sudan and talked to UNHCR staff there and at the organisation’s headquarters in Geneva, and another year later I made a third trip to Nairobi. When I first arrived in the Kenyan capital the UNHCR office was still recovering from a UN investigation that had uncovered extensive corruption. Thousands of resettlement case files had been tainted and needed to be reassessed, adding to the backlog of applications. Meanwhile, thousands of refugees were living in Nairobi in dire circumstances, treated as criminals by the Kenyan government and harassed by police. And another 200, 000 or more refugees - mainly Somalis and Sudanese - were living in two large camps in remote, arid areas. Although it wasn’t clear at the time, Kenya itself was living through the dying days of the increasingly corrupt and inept government of Daniel arap Moi. The head of refugee protection at the UNHCR’s Nairobi office, Sergio Calle-Noreña, was treating the murder of the two children very seriously. He had visited their mother in hospital early on the morning after the attack to try to find out what had happened, and described in great detail the speculation about how and why the attack had taken place. He told me that although the family was classified as an urgent case, the UNHCR hadn’t realised they faced any immediate danger. “You must remember,” he said, “that the wife and daughter of President Habyarimana are moving around in the streets of Belgium with no problems. ” But he conceded that the family had been attacked more than once when they lived in Uganda. In Nairobi the family had been living in a centre run by Goal, an Irish aid agency. Under an agreement with the UNHCR, no one at Goal would talk to me about the case, but later I was told that staff there felt that the UNHCR had not made it clear the family was potentially in danger. This failure on the part of the UNHCR could well have been a symptom of the pressure the office had been under following the corruption inquiry. No one I spoke to questioned Calle-Noreña’s competence or his dedication to the job; one aid worker described him as among “the best” of the UNHCR people she’d met during a long career working in the field. Nor did anyone I spoke to in Nairobi blame the Australian authorities for the delays in processing the family. A few days after the attack the woman was shifted to a convent, where she was looked after while the police investigation proceeded. She was now classified as an emergency case, and her approval for travel came through quickly from the Australian High Commission. She left Kenya for Australia at around the same time that the police, lacking evidence, released the two Rwandan suspects from custody. Apart from Calle-Noreña, the local Agence France Presse correspondent and, off the record, an aid agency employee, no one was willing to talk about the case, so it was difficult to sort out exactly what went wrong. But it became clear to me that significant barriers stood in the way of many of the refugees for whom resettlement was the best option. Some were the result of the policies of the UNHCR and resettlement countries, others were created by host countries - in this case, Kenya - and others reflected the circumstances facing refugees almost anywhere. Taken together, these obstacles meant that some of the most vulnerable refugees faced almost impossible odds in seeking to settle in countries like Australia, Canada and the United States. Off the record, UNHCR staff described to me how the largest resettlement countries, including Australia, accepted refugees selectively, favouring certain nationalities over others - the mainly Christian Sudanese over the mainly Muslim Somalis, for example - on the basis of their assumed capacity to integrate into their new home country. Women were generally experiencing greater difficulty than men in gaining access to resettlement countries, and refugees with medical conditions could face enormous odds. At the time, the humanitarian intake of each of these countries was still skewed heavily against Africa, despite the fact that hundreds of thousands of refugees were living in long-term refugee camps dotted across the continent, with little prospect of a return home. As much as anything, the character of Australia’s resettlement program reflected the fact that Australia’s immigration policies - like those of the United States, Canada and New Zealand but unlike most European countries - have mainly served economic goals, filling gaps in the labour market and generating domestic demand. Although the humanitarian program drew from a different pool of potential immigrants, it tended to reflect the same pragmatic imperatives as the wider immigration program. Yet Philip Ruddock was arguing that his government’s hostile response to unauthorised arrivals was justified because Australia was helping the neediest refugees through the resettlement program. In its failure to translate rhetoric into reality, Australia was not alone. Writing in 2002 the academic researchers Matthew Gibney and Randall Hansen described the US, Canadian and Australian resettlement programs as “a kind of adjunct to skilled migration schemes,” granting admission to “pre-screened refugees from first countries of asylum. ” When I began gathering material for this book the evidence tended to support that view, or at least the view that these three countries selected the most employable, assimilable refugees regardless of how vulnerable they were in their first country of asylum. But the declining number of refugees seeking resettlement from south-eastern Europe (particularly the former Yugoslavia) was helping to stimulate a reappraisal. Over a relatively short period the focus of the Australian program shifted significantly, better reflecting the international distribution of vulnerable refugees who had little prospect of repatriation or making a life in a neighbouring country. The program still has its limitations, and it has been used, illogically, by immigration ministers Philip Ruddock and Amanda Vanstone to help justify Australia’s inhumane and legally dubious policies of naval interdiction, mandatory detention and deportation of asylum seekers. But it deserves to be recognised as a contribution to dealing with the large, entrenched concentrations of refugees in countries like Kenya that are poorly equipped to offer security, shelter and food. *** TWO and a half years after I first travelled to East Africa, the Sudanese government signed a peace agreement with the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement, ending over twenty years of renewed war between north and south. At war for much of the period since the late 1950 <b>s,</b> <b>Sudan</b> had contributed enormously to the refugee crisis in north-eastern Africa. In January 2005, thousands of Sudanese refugees and exiles cheered and sang in Nairobi as twelve African heads of state, two European ministers and the US secretary of state watched the vice-president of Sudan and the chair of the southern movement sign the accord. Celebrations took place in Melbourne as well, involving about 200 of what ABC News called “the estimated two to three thousand Australian-based Sudanese. ” The ABC’s figure was wrong: by the beginning of 2005 over 14, 000 Sudanese had arrived in Australia, almost all of them as refugees or humanitarian applicants who had fled to Kenya. Nearly three-quarters of them had arrived since mid 2002. The geographic focus of Australia’s resettlement program had changed dramatically in less than three years. • Peter Browne is editor of APO.
