40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for global wideband satellite communication services on vessels {{has led to}} applications that enable Earth Stations on board Vessels (ESVs) to use Fixed-Satellite Service (FSS) networks operating in the uplink band 14 - 14. 5 GHz. The broadband communication solution requested from these kinds of vessels can only be provided by using the ESV services - today offered by several telecommunication operators. Transmitting capacity may vary between 19. 2 kbit/s up to 1 - 2 Mbit/s. From the International Radio Regulatory view, {{in accordance with the}} Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union, the 14 - 14. 5 GHz band is allocated to the Mobile-Satellite Service (Earth-to-Space), except to the Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Service (AMSS) on a secondary basis, to the Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) on a primary basis in all ITU regions and to the Fixed Service (FS) in many countries through Radio Regulations Article 5 footnotes. Hence, whichever operational frequency for the mobile earth station is chosen within 14 - 14. 5 GHz, there may be a need to consider the potential interference caused to the FS receivers. Particularly, in the case of mobile earth stations installed on vessels, interference problems may be created to the Fixed <b>Service</b> <b>receivers</b> placed near the coastline or on small islands. For countries like Greece, the problem is even more intense since there are many islands where Fixed Service links may be deployed and a great number of vessels equipped with Earth Stations operating in the 14 / 11 GHz band travel throughout Aegean Sea every day especially during summer. This paper examines the potential interference from earth stations on vessels to Fixed <b>Service</b> <b>receivers</b> in the 14 GHz band when the vessels are traveling close to the coastline. The parameters that {{have an impact on the}} interference calculations are presented and simulations are conducted for various realistic interference scenarios. It is shown that, the interference caused to the Fixed <b>Service</b> <b>receivers</b> is negligible if some operational limits are imposed to the vessels equipped with Earth Stations...|$|R

40|$|In this chapter, {{we define}} DS-CDMA/OFDM {{spectrum}} sharing systems and investigate {{the impact of}} the primary service communication activity as well as other system parameters on the interference level at the secondary <b>service</b> <b>receiver.</b> The achieved capacity of the secondary service {{is directly related to the}} interference level at the secondary <b>service</b> <b>receiver</b> as well as the secondary service adopted sub-channel selection policy. The achievable capacity of the secondary service in such systems is obtained under different sub-channel selection policies in fading environments. Two general sub-channel selection policies are studied in this chapter: uniform sub-channel selection and non-uniform sub-channel selection. Uniform sub-channel selection fits into the cases where a priori knowledge on sub-channels state information is not available at the secondary transmitter. For cases with available a priori knowledge on sub-channels state information, a variety of non-uniform sub-channel selection policies are studied. We then present results on the scaling law of the opportunistic spectrum sharing in DS-CDMA/OFDM systems with multiple users. We provide numerical results to compare different sub-channel selection policies...|$|E

40|$|As the {{investment}} in outsourcing continues to grow, both <b>service</b> provider and <b>receiver</b> face an increasing pressure to exhibit the value of outsourcing. Improving {{the quality of a}} relationship between <b>service</b> provider and <b>receiver</b> has frequently been suggested as the best way to meet this challenge. Recent studies stress that the most critical time for a successful interorganizational relationship is {{at the beginning of their}} relationships.

A great deal of interest in trust has been described, but there has been little in the way of strong theoretical models to aid in understanding the role of trust, the antecedents of trust, and the consequences of trust in outsourcing relationship. This study suggests an integrative model of trust in the context of outsourcing by adopting Mayer and Davis’s organizational trust model and then attempts to empirically explore the role of initial trust, initial distrust, and trust with knowledge sharing as mechanisms for a successful outsourcing project from the <b>service</b> <b>receiver’s</b> perspective.

However, in terms of service switching, the perceptions of child-care providers are significantly different from those of consumers when attributing causes of switching, and examining post-switching behavior.
