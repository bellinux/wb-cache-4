50|$|The Infantry {{has made}} two {{complete}} cycles between white and light blue. During the Revolutionary War, white facings were prescribed for the Infantry. White {{was the color}} used for Infantry until 1851 at which time light or <b>Saxony</b> <b>blue</b> was prescribed for the pompon and for the trimming on Infantry horse furniture. In 1857, the color was prescribed as light or sky blue. In 1886, the linings of capes and trouser stripes were prescribed to be white. However, in 1902, the light blue was prescribed again. In 1917, the cape was still lined with light blue but the Infantry trouser stripes were of white as were the chevrons for enlisted men. The infantry color is light blue; however, infantry regimental flags and guidons have been National Flag blue since 1835. White {{is used as a}} secondary color on the guidons for letters, numbers, and insignia.|$|E
5000|$|Buxton {{enters the}} ruins of the old treacle factory where he is crowned King after {{correctly}} identifying the colours of seven doors (coloured different shades of blue). He recognises the first door as blue. When he enters the next room, he discovers a machine sorting out blue flowers and dumping the other colour flowers. The blue voice then says her famous line [...] "Blue is beautiful, blue is best. I'm blue, I'm beautiful, I'm best!". The second door is cobalt blue. Buxton enters a room with piles of clothing. A large machine is collecting the blue clothing and putting the other coloured clothing in a trunk. The machine also accidentally puts a blue sheet onto Buxton. Buxton correctly guesses the third door to be <b>Saxony</b> <b>blue.</b> In here, he meets an array of scary masks. Once he escapes, Buxton goes through the fourth door, which is indigo. Buxton finds himself in an observatory-like room. He finds the fifth door to be baby blue, though he momentarily forgets. He then enters the room of thunder and lightning. The next door is Prussian blue. He finds the guard room, where his blue men are created. Buxton then jumps through a small gap in between his men to reach the final door, royal blue. After being crowned, he sings a song.|$|E

6000|$|And now {{the wedding}} party began to {{assemble}} at Todgers's. Mr Jinkins, the only boarder invited, {{was on the ground}} first. He wore a white favour in his button-hole, and a bran new extra super double-milled <b>blue</b> <b>saxony</b> dress coat (that was its description in the bill), with a variety of tortuous embellishments about the pockets, invented by the artist to do honour to the day. The miserable Augustus no longer felt strongly even on the subject of Jinkins. He hadn't strength of mind enough to do it. 'Let him come!' he had said, in answer to Miss Pecksniff, when she urged the point. 'Let him come! He has ever been my rock ahead through life. 'Tis meet he should be there. Ha, ha! Oh, yes! let Jinkins come!' ...|$|R
40|$|The {{decrease}} of mussel {{stocks in the}} tidal flats of Lower Saxony in the 1980 s and 1990 s and in Schleswig-Holstein since the early 1990 s was not reversed by a strong spatfall in spring 1996. The decrease was only interrupted and delayed. Mussel fisheries in Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony {{have been subject to}} a fishery programme and management plan since 1997 and 1999 respectively. These measures are accompanied by monitoring of intertidal mussel stocks. Monitoring in Lower <b>Saxony</b> showed that <b>blue</b> mussel areas and biomass reached their all-time minimum level in the spring of 1996. After the inventory in spring, a strong spatfall took place which led to the largest growth of mussel stocks in 1999. Following several years with a negative trend, mussel stocks have levelled off at a low level for 7 years. But for the past 5 years, there has been a positive trend in biomass. Mussel stocks in the Wadden Sea area of Schleswig-Holstein remained at an average level until 2001. Values then fell to one fifth of their former maximum values (recorded {{at the end of the}} 1980 s) and, with 1 / 10 in 2010, dropped to their lowest level since the beginning of monitoring. Mussel stocks have not recovered so far. The shrinking of mussel bed area and biomass is superimposed by the spread of the Pacific oyster; there has been no general regeneration of blue mussel stocks. Between 1980 and 2000, a small but persistent mussel stock existed in the rocky northern intertidal of the island of Helgoland, which is part of Schleswig Holstein, but data from this period is incomplete. Since 2005 / 2006 the number of recorded individuals in the monitoring area decreased to only approx. 3...|$|R
