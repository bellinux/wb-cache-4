50|$|Angle {{grinders}} can be {{powered by}} an electric motor, petrol engine or compressed air. The motor drives a geared head at a right-angle on which is mounted an abrasive disc or a thinner cut-off disc, either {{of which can}} be replaced when worn. Angle grinders typically have an adjustable guard and a side-handle for two-handed operation. Certain angle grinders, depending on their speed range, can be used as sanders, employing a <b>sanding</b> <b>disc</b> with a backing pad or disc. The backing system is typically made of hard plastic, phenolic resin, or medium-hard rubber depending on the amount of flexibility desired.|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{developed}} and standardized a sanding method {{to evaluate the}} emission of airborne particles from products that contain carbon nanotubes (CNTs) under different conditions, including three types of sandpaper and three <b>sanding</b> <b>disc</b> speed. We also characterized the emission of the airborne particles from one neat epoxy test sample, four CNTs-incorporating test samples with different CNTs loading, and two commercial products. The total number concentration, respirable mass concentration, and particle size number/mass distribution of the emitted particles were calculated and compared, followed by an electron microscopy (EM) analysis. These {{data suggest that the}} sanding process can produce substantial quantities of airborne particles. Also, the emission of airborne particles was associated with different test conditions. EM analysis of the airborne particle samples showed embedded CNTs protruding from the outer surface, which was different from CNTs-incorporating bulk material. Our study suggests a potential generation of particles during the life cycle event of sanding. Further studies should be carried out to investigate the potential human health hazard in other life cycle events...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the testing results of experimental measurements of cutting power during sanding {{of natural and}} modified beech wood depending {{on the value of}} specific pressure of 0. 66; 0. 84; 1. 04; 1. 47 N·cm- 2. The <b>sand</b> <b>discs</b> with a diameter of 150 mm and grit size of 40, 80 and 120 made by the firm SIAFAST (Germany) were used in this experiment. The measurement was carried out on experimental equipment designed by the Department of Woodworking at the Technical University in Zvolen. The highest values of wood removal at the cutting speed vc = 4. 57 m·s- 1 in transverse direction were at the grit size 120 and the lowest at 40 for natural beech wood, as well as for hydrothermally treated wood. The influence of hydrothermally treated wood on the value of wood removal is the least important in terms of significance (unit pressure, grit size, hydrothermally treated wood) ...|$|R

40|$|Nature and {{periodicity}} {{of growth}} rings were investigated in Sonneratia apetala and Heritiera fomes, two Bangladeshi mangrove species. From both species we collected three stem discs {{in the natural}} forest reserve of the Sundarbans. In addition, three discs were sampled from planta-tion-grown S. apetala trees of known age. <b>Sanded</b> stem <b>discs</b> revealed distinct growth rings but no periodic fluctuations in vessel variables (vessel density, vessel diameter, vessel grouping), which were meas-ured at high resolution along a transect from pith to bark. The number of growth rings in plantation-grown S. apetala trees corresponded with the documented tree age, hence strongly suggesting the growth rings to be annual. Within species, the annual nature of the rings was further supported by a good match between the tree-ring series. The similar mean curves of S. apetala and H. fomes, growing at the same site in the Sundarbans, pointed {{to the presence of}} an external factor influencing their growth. A combination of precipitation and temperature was suggested influencing substrate salinity and phenological events. It became evident that tree-ring research in combination with the analysis of vessel patterns is a valuable tool to further investigate the complex interactions between tree growth and site ecology in mangrove forests.

40|$|The {{effect on}} emitter {{clogging}} of four filtration systems (<b>sand,</b> screen, <b>disc</b> and {{a combination of}} screen and disc filters) and six emitter types placed in laterals 87  m long, using two different effluents with low suspended solid levels from a wastewater treatment plant, was studied for 1000  h. Four of the emitters were molded and welded into dripline wall, two of them being pressure-compensated {{and the other two}} non-pressure-compensated. The other two emitters, both pressure-compensated, were inserted into thick wall. Emitter clogging was affected mainly by emitter type, location along the lateral and the interaction between these two factors. Differences among emitters with larger clogging were only observed at the end of dripline. Two molded and welded emitters showed the worst performance: one non-pressure-compensated with the lowest passage section, and the other pressure-compensated that, after 800  h working at higher dripline flow and particle load, experienced an important decrease in flow rate. Only with the effluent that had a higher number of particles, did the filter and the interaction of filter and emitter location have a significant effect. Emitters placed after screen and sand filters showed the largest flow rates at the lateral ending, even though only sand filtration significantly reduced turbidity and suspended solids. Emitters protected by a disc filter experienced the largest flow rate reductions. Wastewater Drip irrigation Filtration Clogging...|$|R
40|$|The inland drift sand area in The Netherlands forms {{a unique}} {{ecosystem}} in northern Europe, but {{is characterized by}} a rapid decline in both aeolian activity and area size. It is therefore necessary to investigate how the drift sand areas can be preserved, and how their immobilization by vegetation can be counteracted by introducing techniques that reactivate the aeolian processes. Four such techniques (rotary cultivator, beach <b>sand</b> cleaner, <b>disc</b> harrow and excavator) were evaluated during an 8 -month experiment at Kootwijkerzand, The Netherlands. The effectiveness of the techniques to reactivate the aeolian processes was measured by investigating their effect on the horizontal sediment flux. Furthermore, the Wind Erosion Prediction System was used to simulate the effect of the different techniques, without the noise related to field measurements. Both field experiment and model simulation showed that the most effective method is the beach sand cleaner, followed by the rotary cultivator. Unlike measurement in the field, the model did not simulate any mass transport on the plot tilled with the excavator. Here incoming sediment could have initiated mass transport. In the case of the plot tilled with the disc harrow the model overestimated the transport. In reality, however, a surface layer with a high random roughness shows large variation in moisture content in space and time resulting in lower mass transpor...|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to paper, backing for sandpaper includes cloth (cotton, polyester, rayon), PET film, and [...] "fibre", or rubber. Cloth backing {{is used for}} sandpaper discs and belts, while mylar is used as backing for extremely fine grits. Fibre or vulcanized fibre is a strong backing material consisting of many layers of polymer impregnated paper. The weight of the backing is usually designated by a letter. For paper backings, the weight ratings range from [...] "A" [...] to [...] "F," [...] with A designating the lightest and F the heaviest. Letter nomenclature follows a different system for cloth backings, {{with the weight of}} the backing rated J, X, Y, T, and M, from lightest to heaviest. A flexible backing allows sandpaper to follow irregular contours of a workpiece; relatively inflexible backing is optimal for regular rounded or flat surfaces. Sandpaper backings may be glued to the paper or form a separate support structure for moving sandpaper, such as used in <b>sanding</b> belts and <b>discs.</b> Stronger paper or backing increases the ease of sanding wood. The harder the backing material, the faster the sanding, the faster the wear of the paper and the rougher the sanded surface.|$|R

40|$|The {{microbiological}} quality of effluents from different macrofiltration systems (pressure <b>sand</b> filter and <b>disc</b> filter) used as pre-treatment and membrane technologies (microfiltration and ultrafiltration) was evaluated {{in order to}} determine their possible application as alternatives to disinfection of urban wastewater prior to reutilization. Microbiological quality was determined by reference to nematode egg content, fecal coliforms, E. coli and somatic coliphages. Pathogenic nematode eggs were efficiently retained by the macrofiltration systems. However, since other types of nematode eggs were present in the effluents treated by both systems, the possibility of such infective agents appearing after this type of treatment cannot be discounted. The membrane technologies proved highly efficient at retaining micro-organisms, achieving effluents of excellent {{microbiological quality}}. However, the effluents could not be classified as sterile, since contamination of permeation zones gave rise to the presence of micro-organisms. This result casts doubt on the validity of using the fecal coliform indicator to assess microbiological quality of effluents from these systems. Differences between the two membrane technologies were noted with regard to viral particle retention capacity, with only the ultrafiltration module achieving effluents with total absence of fecal contamination indicators. The macrofiltration systems may present problems when used as pre-treatments to standard disinfection systems (UV radiation, reactive oxidant disinfection). Such problems do not arise with the membrane technologies, which offer a valid alternative for the disinfection of urban wastewater prior to reutilization...|$|R
40|$|Background: In 2007, three {{patients}} from Impregnated Web Technology (IWT) factory {{were referred to}} Groote Schuur occupational clinic with contact dermatitis. The IWT factory manufactures <b>sanding</b> and grinding <b>discs,</b> traditionally a low latex exposure industry. Workers at this factory were introduced to latex gloves in 2004 to protect their hands for various reasons. One of the patient was referred with raised latex specific IgE. Our preliminary diagnosis was irritant contact dermatitis. The dermatitis cleared after avoiding latex gloves. The other two were referred with negative latex specific IgE. One was subsequently diagnosed of fiberglass dermatitis confirmed with histology {{and the other with}} urticaria based on the history. Because of the perception that skin problems equate to latex allergy we decided to study the relevance of a positive latex specific IgE in a nonmedical setting. Objective: The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the prevalence and relevance of latex sensitization at this traditionally a low latex exposure factory. It also aimed to increase awareness of latex exposure and provide recommendations for preventing and managing latex allergies. Methods: A cross sectional study of the workers on duty was conducted at the IWT factory over 2 days. There were no exclusion criteria. Ethics approval was obtained. Workers who volunteered were asked to sign informed consent and answer 3 questionnaires. Questioned asked were related to glove use at work and at home. They were also examined by the investigator and had a blood sample taken for total IgE and latex specific IgE measurement. Results: There were 160 workers on the factory floor over the study period. Only 81 workers volunteered giving a response rate of 51 %. The point prevalence of latex sensitization was 16 %(13 / 81). There was a significant relationship between workers who had skin signs and wore glove, however there was no association between glove usage and total and latex specific IgE. A raised latex specific IgE was associated with permanent employment. Conclusion: The prevalence of elevated latex specific IgE amongst workers at IWT factory was high, in the range of that reported of medical personnel, suggesting a source of latex exposure in the work place. The reasons for glove use amongst the workers revealed an appropriate use of natural rubber latex gloves with unnecessary latex exposure. Although we could not link the high prevalence of latex specific IgE to the use of gloves, subgroup analysis with larger numbers of workers may expose an association suggested by a higher prevalence in permanent workers. We suggest the use of more appropriate gloves selected for the protection needed. A latex specific IgE test should be performed only for workers with strong suspicion of latex sensitization, not simply skin signs and symptoms...|$|R
