5|$|A trough {{developed}} {{along the}} northeast monsoon on 25October 2015 off the southwest coast of India, {{consisting of a}} fragmented area of convection, or thunderstorms. The system was located within an environment of moderate wind shear, which prevented early development, although conditions were anticipated to become more favorable. On 26October, the system developed a distinct low pressure area. The low gradually consolidated, and the circulation became better defined, amplified by decreasing wind shear and good outflow {{to the north and}} south. At 03:00UTC on 28October, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a depression. Nine hours later, the agency upgraded it further to a deep depression, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the <b>system</b> <b>as</b> Tropical Cyclone 04A at 21:00UTC.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on March24 to the east-southeast of the Marshall Islands. Initially {{it consisted}} of a broad but consolidating circulation, with outflow to the north offsetting moderate wind shear to aid in development. It gradually became better organized, with a curved area of convection wrapping into the center. On March26, the JMA classified the <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a tropical depression just east of Pohnpei. On March27, the JTWC started tracking the <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a Tropical Depression 04W. Moving west-northwestward, the system's center became more consolidated with convective banding becoming wrapped into it. The JTWC upgraded 04W to a tropical storm the same day, and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Maysak.|$|E

5|$|During late November, {{an area of}} {{convection}} persisted about 625kilometers (390mi) east-southeast of Pohnpei. Satellite imagery indicated broad cyclonic {{turning in}} {{the lower levels of}} the atmosphere, and a trough was located near the surface. The disturbance developed rainbands and gradually became better organized. By December2, the system had an elongated low-level circulation, located to the south of the convection. At 0600UTC that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a tropical depression about 735km (450mi) east-northeast of Pohnpei. Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, and at 1800UTC on December 2 the agency classified the <b>system</b> <b>as</b> Tropical Depression 31W. Initially the depression moved to the west-northwest, and early on December3 the JTWC classified the <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a tropical storm.|$|E

5|$|In early April 1996, a {{surge in}} the trade winds interacted with the monsoon trough to produce an area of convection. On 2April, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) first {{identified}} the <b>system</b> <b>as</b> a low to mid-level low pressure area over Indonesia north of Darwin, Australia. Despite strong wind shear, the system slowly became better organized as it moved southward, aided by improving upper-level outflow. Early on 5April, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the <b>system</b> <b>as</b> Tropical Cyclone 25S as the system began a westward track, steered by a building mid-level ridge to the south. Shortly thereafter, the BoM upgraded the system to a Category1 cyclone, designating the storm as Tropical Cyclone Olivia.|$|E
