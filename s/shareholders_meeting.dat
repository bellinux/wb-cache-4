5|$|Denmark's Sterling Airways bought ILG's {{share of}} Norway Airlines in mid July. The {{airlines}} announced a partnership, which also included Transwede. The Wallenberg-controlled NRT owned a 48-percent stake in Sterling and 66 percent of Transwede—the remaining third owned by Sterling. The three airlines applied for concessions {{to operate on}} the capital triangle between Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm. SAS held a monopoly on these routes and the airlines intended to capture the leisure market between the capital regions. Both ILG and Sterling were hindered in owning {{more than a third}} of Norway Airlines because of Norwegian corporate legislation. Fokus Bank had gradually become the largest shareholder in Norway Airline and owned 40.6 percent of the company in July 1991.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the rules}} regarding the internet-based exercise of shareholder rights for public corporations incorporated in Canada, France, Germany, the U. S. (DelGCL & RMBCA), the UK and Switzerland. The traditional doctrine associates information, communication and voting with <b>shareholder</b> <b>meetings.</b> In addition, <b>shareholder</b> <b>meetings</b> regularly prompt reviews of management's activities exercised {{on behalf of}} shareholders by accountants or the judiciary. The analysis reveals that the current regimes of <b>shareholder</b> <b>meetings</b> merely provide for voting and information {{in the context of}} a digital environment, while communication and review is usually not replicated. The lack of all functions of traditional <b>shareholder</b> <b>meetings</b> is one reason of why exclusively virtual <b>shareholder</b> <b>meetings</b> have not gained widely spread acceptance across jurisdictions. Another reason is that a well-fitting design for the web-based exercise of shareholder rights does not yet exist. Thus, the paper develops an advisable design of Virtual <b>Shareholder</b> <b>Meetings</b> that replicates all for functions of traditional <b>shareholder</b> <b>meetings,</b> while it is likely to reduce shareholder apathy at the same time. It argues that enabling more frequent opportunities for voting is the logical consequence of the developments of continuous disclosure requirements and continuous buy/hold/sell-decisions by market participants. Therefore, the virtual exercise of shareholder rights should be achieved through (1) liberalizing currently existing legislative and practical barriers, and in particular, time and place restrictions on shareholder meetings; (2) re-integrating analyst and institutional investor meetings in the process of <b>shareholder</b> <b>meetings,</b> and (3) substituting for the traditional face-to-face accountability of managers to shareholders through specific electronic means. The latter involves, specifically, the use of RSS-Feed and XBRL-technologies for gathering and evaluating information, the use of the company's website as the central communication platform for management to shareholders and shareholders to shareholders, and the election of an independent shareholder rights manager (firm) by the shareholder body with procedural, technical, and organizational authority for organizing the exercise of shareholder rights. Ideally, the blueprint presented herein achieves the harmonization of voting behavior and market reactions, thereby furthering market efficiency...|$|R

25|$|Ben locates Maureen, who is {{a member}} of rival biker gang the Vultures, at the Vulture's hideout, a large cargo aircraft. Maureen {{believes}} Ben killed her father and is about to have him executed, but Ben reveals personal information that Malcolm shared with him and convinces her to develop Miranda's film, which shows that Ripburger was the murderer. Ben suggests exposing Ripburger at the <b>shareholders</b> <b>meeting,</b> but Ripburger has postponed the meeting until he is sure Ben and Maureen are dead. The Vultures come up with a plan to fake Ben and Maureen's deaths by entering them in a demolition derby under false identities that will be obvious to Ripburger. Their cars are rigged to explode, but Ben is protected by a fireproof suit and Maureen's car ejects her safely out of the stadium. The plan works and results in the deaths of Bolus and Nestor, while the Vultures recover the winner's prize: a special motorcycle built by Malcolm and Maureen that contains a hidden pass code to Malcolm's safe, in which Ben finds Malcolm's recorded will and testament. Ben exposes Ripburger during the <b>shareholders</b> <b>meeting</b> by projecting Miranda's photos of the murder and playing Malcolm's will, in which he leaves leadership of Corley Motors to Maureen.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, Dimitar Penev took the lead as coach for a second time. CSKA reached {{the second round of}} the UEFA Cup, and won the Bulgarian Cup, but {{disappointed}} in the domestic league, finishing in fifth place in 1999. That season, the young talents of Martin Petrov, Stilian Petrov, Dimitar Berbatov and Vladimir Manchev started to play a bigger role in the team. There were problems with player-indexing due to some unpaid obligations to Neftochimik. In the domestic championship, CSKA had only 16 players registered for the 1999–2000 season and some un-indexed players took part in official UEFA games. Consequently, at the <b>shareholders</b> <b>meeting</b> at the end of 1999, the club ownership was transferred to businessman Vasil Bozhkov, who became majority owner.|$|E
40|$|What is the Function of the <b>Shareholder</b> <b>Meeting?</b> Evidence {{from the}} U. S. Proxy Voting Process The paper studies the proxy {{material}} and the voting results for more than 6, 000 proposals at <b>shareholder</b> <b>meetings</b> by large U. S. corporations in 1993 - 1997. We document that management proposals always pass and that shareholder proposals always fail. Hence, the voting results are known to participants when they receive the proxy material in the mail box. This finding begs the questions what is {{the function of the}} <b>shareholder</b> <b>meeting</b> and why do more than 80 % of the Berle and Means (1932) state that ”the proxy process is rigged by management and removes the power from the shareholders”.

Malcolm suspects that Ripburger is scheming to take over the company, and is suspicious of Ripburger's plan to recruit a biker gang to ride with them to the meeting. Malcolm's limousine is overtaken by one such gang, the Polecats, and he is immediately impressed with them. Catching up to them at a biker bar, he quickly befriends their leader, Ben (Roy Conrad). Ripburger offers to hire the Polecats to escort Malcolm to the meeting, but when Ben declines, he is knocked out by Ripburger's flunkies, Bolus (Jack Angel) and Nestor (Maurice LaMarche).|$|E
25|$|Investments were in 1907 {{estimated}} to NOK12million, of which NOK4.3 was for transport investments, NOK4.5million for the separation and briquetting plants, and NOK1.5million for {{investments in the}} mine. Capital was borrowed from a consortium consisting of Norddeutsche Bank, Disconto-Gesellschaft, Centralbanken for Norge and Stockholms Enskilda Bank. In addition the share capital was increased to NOK10million at the <b>shareholders</b> <b>meeting</b> in October 1907. A. Herden was hired by Metallurgiska to construct the separation plant and briquetting, which was dimensioned to for an annual export of 600,000 tonnes. This was later reduced to an export capacity of 330,000 tonnes. Pehrson resigned from 1 July 1908 {{and was replaced by}} Carl Lundh. To ensure all-year access to the port, the company ordered the 250-kilowatt (350hp) icebreaker SS Sydvaranger, which was delivered in 1907 and operated by the subsidiary Dampskib Aktieselskabet Pasvik.

In March, the South Eastern Railway Bill had its second reading in Parliament. Sir Charles Russell, MP stated that the South Eastern Railway (SER) had done everything in its power to obstruct the English Channel Steamship Company. Lord Elcho stated that if the railway was sincere in its desire to improve communication with the continent (the stated aim of the bill), then it would run its trains to suit Castalia, rather than expecting the ship to run to suit its trains. After some discussion, the bill passed its second reading. Sir Edward Watkin was asked about this state of affairs at a <b>shareholders</b> <b>meeting</b> of the SER on 3 August. He replied that the railway could not run a special and regular service of trains to meet an irregular sailing schedule such as that operated by Castalia, which did not run in the winter.

500|$|Gulf {{management}} and directors took {{the view that}} the Mesa bid represented an undervaluation of the Gulf business as a long-term going concern and that it was not in the interest of Gulf shareholders. [...] James Lee, Gulf's CEO and chairman, even claimed during the November 1983 <b>shareholders</b> <b>meeting</b> to address the Mesa ownership that Pickens' royalty trust idea {{was nothing more than a}} [...] "get-rich-quick scheme" [...] that would undermine the corporation's profit potential in the coming decades. [...] Gulf, therefore, sought to resist Pickens by various means, including refiling as a Delaware corporation, voiding the ability of shareholders to cumulatively vote (fearing that Pickens would use his shares to gain control of the board) and listening to offers from Ashland Oil (which would double Gulf's price from its pre-Mesa level), General Electric (two years before it took over the media company NBC/RKO) and finally Chevron to act as its white knight in late 1984. Gulf divested many of its worldwide operating subsidiaries and then merged with Chevron by the spring of 1985. The Mesa group of investors was reported to have made a profit of $760million ($ million today) when it assigned its Gulf shares to Chevron. [...] Pickens has claimed that after realizing a more than doubling of stock appreciation for Gulf shareholders (as well as its management that fought him at every turn), Mesa's shares were the last to be paid out by Chevron.|$|E

Kenneth Lipper, {{investment banker}} and former deputy mayor of New York for Finance and Economic Development, was also hired as chief technical adviser. At first, he turned Stone down because he felt that the film would be a one-sided attack. Stone asked him to reconsider and Lipper read the script responding with a 13-page critique. For example, he argued that it was unrealistic to have all the characters be [...] "morally bankrupt". Lipper advised Stone on the kind of computers used on the trading floor, the accurate proportion of women at a business meeting, and the kinds of extras that should be seated at the annual <b>shareholders</b> <b>meeting</b> where Gekko delivers his [...] "Greed is good" [...] speech. Stone agreed with Lipper's criticism and asked him to rewrite the script. Lipper brought a balance to the film and this helped Stone get permission to shoot {{on the floor of the}} New York Stock Exchange during trading hours. Lipper and Stone disagreed over the character of Lou Mannheim. Stone shot a scene showing the honest Mannheim giving in to insider trading, but Lipper argued that audiences might conclude that everyone on Wall Street is corrupt and insisted that the film needed an unimpeachable character. Stone cut the scene.|$|E
