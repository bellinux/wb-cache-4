It was not until a third hour of discussion that Mr. Bright would let it come to an end, and at the end he was still uncertain. The next day the friend met him, looking worn and gloomy. “You may guess,” Mr. Bright said, “what sort of a night I have had.” He had decided to vote against the second reading. The same person went to Lord Hartington. He took time to deliberate, and then finally said, “No; Mr. Gladstone and I do not mean the same thing.” ...|$|E

Whenever the public school coaches were polled about removing Cretin they were overwhelmingly in favor. [...] They offered to allow Cretin play the conference as an independent {{and as a result}} not be eligible for Conference titles or awards. The following spring the Saint Paul Public Schools superintendent decided not to bring the issue to the school board, which had the authority to drop Cretin. The superintendent cited that the issue was too political to remove the only Catholic school in a heavily Catholic city. He also reasoned {{that it would be better}} to improve the competitive level of the public schools including the elementary and junior high sports teams. That plan would have cost seven figures and was quickly discarded. In the fall of 1998 Cretin expressed interest in joining a new athletic conference. In 1999 supporters of Humboldt High School asked the Saint Paul Public Schools superintendent to either remove Cretin or find a new conference for Humboldt to compete in because of the large gap in talent. A month later the public school's athletic directors agreed to <b>support</b> <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> remove Cretin for the 2000-2001 school year.

40|$|Career {{counselling}} {{is central}} to facilitating high school students’ postsecondary goals. Research studies have revealed student dissatisfaction with career guidance, but how do counsellors respond? Dialogue between counsellors who provide guidance and students who are discontent with career planning services is scarce. Counsellor and student opinions need to be collaborated and communicated {{to each other for}} practical and relevant practice. This thesis considers counsellor and student perspectives to inform effective career education in secondary schools. A mixed methods approach was used to examine existing policies in place at one Ontario high school. A survey of 35 Grades 11 and 12 students assessed student initiative towards, and opinions about, counselling. Interviews with 2 counsellors provided a more in-depth understanding of the counsellor-student discourse, contextualised realistic practice, and suggested methods to manage student expectations and needs. Findings indicated complementary results. Students were largely confident in their postsecondary goals, but a smaller percentage credited counsellors for their success. A majority of students sought advice from their counsellors, but responded differently on the quality of guidance received. Many Grade 12 students felt they were not receiving enough exclusive and specific attention. Counsellors’ multifaceted responsibilities did not allow for special attention to the graduating class. Differences between counsellor and student perspectives lay in their respective opinions about effective practice. However, both parties felt more counsellors or lower student-tocounsellor ratios would benefit their working relationship and improve provisions for student needs. Results suggest the need to better define counsellor and student responsibilities. Assessment of student concerns and counsellor responses <b>support</b> <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> infuse career development into other high school subject areas. Career education needs to encourage student independence and enforce student accountability for their career development...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an objective}} metric {{for assessing the}} effectiveness of a parsing scheme. Information theoretic indicators can be used to show whether a given scheme captures some of the structure of natural language text. We then use this method to <b>support</b> <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> decompose the parsing task into computationally more tractable subtasks. The principle on which the grammar evaluator is based is derived from Shannon's original work with letter sequences [1]. We show how his ideas can be extended to other linguistic entities. We describe a method of representation that enables the entropy of sentences to be measured under different parsing schemes. The entropy is a measure, in a certain sense, of the degree of unpredictability. If the grammar captures some of the structure of language, then the relative entropy of the text should decline after parsing. We can thus objectively assess whether parsers that accord with some linguistic intuition do indeed capture some regularity in natural language. Natural language can be seen as having a tertiary structure. First, there are the relationships between adjacent words, a structure that can be modelled by Markov processes. Then words can be grouped together into constituents and these constituents are organized in a secondary structure. Thirdly, there are relationships between elements of constituents, such as the agreement between the head of a subject and the main verb. These 3 levels are compatible with levels in the Chomsky hierarchy. We need to integrate natural language processing at these different levels. The work described in this paper uses a method of representation that enables primary and secondary structure to be modelled jointly. It concludes by suggesting how this approach could facilitate processing at l [...] ...|$|E
