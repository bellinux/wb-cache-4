6000|$|... "You {{need not}} dread doing <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> only have fair play, and {{establish}} {{the power that}} belongs rightly to you. She would have no chance with you, {{even if he had}} forgiven her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then Amy, {{it would}} be simply wrong of us {{not to go to}} another theatre to-night. I have three and ninepence, <b>so</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> scrape {{together}} one and threepence--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> {{think of}} {{anything}} else that would be useful? <b>If</b> <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> buy it tomorrow before you come out to meet me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{will take}} a drink while you are getting it,' Ned Hampton said. 'I am this lad's mate, and have pretty well {{arranged}} about taking a share in a claim, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like he <b>can</b> go down regularly for you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, but I AM sure," [...] said Adam Verver. [...] "On {{matters of}} {{importance}} I never speak when I'm not. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> yourself FACE such a union you needn't {{in the least}} trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's well. And now I am in need {{of boots}} for my men, {{and you have a}} good many, I see; <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> spare some of these, we will begin to trade at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you. I am {{indeed a}} stranger, and {{happen to have}} neither friend nor {{acquaintance}} in the town, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{put me in the}} way of finding a respectable lodging--a--a cheap one, you will greatly oblige me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{could hardly}} fail to know, even if I had not heard--but from other lips than yours, Agnes, which seems strange--that {{there is someone}} upon whom you have {{bestowed}} the treasure of your love. Do not shut me out of what concerns your happiness <b>so</b> nearly! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> trust me, as <b>you</b> say <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> and as I know you may, let me be your friend, your brother, in this matter, of all others!' ...|$|R

6000|$|Miss Ophelia sat down, {{and pulled}} out her knitting-work, and sat there grim with indignation. She knit and knit, but while she mused the fire burned; at last she broke out--"I tell you, Augustine, I can't get over things <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> It's a perfect abomination for you to defend such a system,--that's my mind!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd like a 'rithmetic better. I read tip-top, but I ain't much on 'rithmetic; <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> spare yours, I {{might take}} a look at it. Now I'm goin' to earn wages, I ought to know about addin' 'em up, and so on," [...] said Ben, with the air of a Vanderbilt oppressed with the care of millions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Creep to the bow, Bladud, {{with your}} helmet off, and show as little of your bulk as may be. Show only your head above the bulwarks, and look as miserable as I did just now--more <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> Take your sword, javelin, and shield with you. I need {{say no more}} to a man of war. Use them when you see your opportunity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But your father's name must {{be joined}} with yours in the debt; and, <b>if</b> <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> come upon the entire {{property}} for the payment. There's no difficulty about that; your sister, of course, must pay the half." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are too good, Mr. Bingham," [...] {{said the}} old clergyman. [...] "Where could another man be found who would lend me £200 without security?" [...] (where indeed!) [...] "By the way," [...] he added, [...] "I forgot; my mind is in such a whirl. Will you come back {{with me for a}} few days to Bryngelly? We shall all be <b>so</b> pleased <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> Do come, Mr. Bingham; you look as though you want a change, you do indeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not, sir," [...] Arnold promised. [...] "You {{can rely}} entirely upon my discretion. You will perhaps tell Mr. Jarvis that I am {{to do my}} work in here. Fortunately, I know a little shorthand, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like I <b>can</b> take the letters down. It will make my {{presence}} seem more reasonable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is a fine}} country, and I {{like all}} the people that live in it," [...] he told Dorothy. [...] "But the fact is, Jim and I don't seem to fit into a fairyland, and the old horse has been begging me to go home again ever since he lost the race. <b>So,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> find a way to fix it, we'll be much obliged to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{that is the}} case, O'Connor, I {{fear that}} it is useless for {{me to try to}} do so; you are so full of ideas always, that if you cannot see your way out of the difficulty, it is hopeless to expect that I could do <b>so.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{contrive}} any plan I will promise to aid you in any way you can point out, but as to inventing one, I should never do so if I racked my brain ever so much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Though I {{should have}} thought such a hoary old wreck {{was nothing but a}} warning. It has been a most unhappy affair from first to last; but Lena is a good, unselfish girl, and nothing else will give Frank a chance of happiness. Waiting will do them no harm, they are young enough, and have no great sum to marry upon, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> bring her to me to-morrow, Julius, I will ask her to grant my poor boy leave to wait till she can see her way to marrying." ...|$|E
5000|$|Wainwright {{began writing}} songs for the album {{following}} the January 2009 inauguration of Barack Obama. In January 2010, Wainwright said the following of the album: As {{of this writing}} some folks are saying things are looking up recession wise and this particular hard time might be ending. Other experts are saying we're in for a [...] "double-dip" [...] and there's more feces heading toward the national and global fans.

40|$|The {{editor of}} Word Ways, A. Ross Eckler, has already {{described}} and reviewed the pattern wordlists of Professor Jack Levine, Department to Mathematics of North Carolina State University (February 1972, November 1972, and August 1973). These wordlists are <b>so</b> excellent that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> buy, borrow or steal them, {{by all means}} do it...|$|R
6000|$|Naturally, therefore, Mr. Spillikins was {{presently}} {{transported to}} the seventh heaven when in due course of time he received a note which said, [...] "We shall be <b>so</b> pleased <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> come out and spend {{a week or two}} with us here. We will send the car down to the Thursday train to meet you. We live here in the simplest fashion possible; in fact, as Mr. Newberry says, we are just roughing it, but I am sure you don't mind for a change. Dulphemia is with us, but we are quite a small party." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{cannot be}} blamed," [...] Trent said. [...] "I am {{satisfied}} {{that you knew}} nothing about it. Now I am {{going to let you}} into a secret. Monty is a rich man if he had his rights, and I want to help him to them. I shall take him back to England with me, but I can't leave for a week or <b>so.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> keep him till then and have some one to watch him day and night, I'll give your husband a hundred pounds for your work here, and build you a church. It's all right! Don't look as though I were mad. I'm a very rich man, that's all, and I shan't miss the money, but I want to feel that Monty is safe till I can start back to England. Will you undertake this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has to be}} <b>so.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be firm so can I. As to my {{name and}} my family, it matters nothing. Could I be allowed to look forward and think that you would sit at my hearth, and that some child that should be my child should lie in your arms, then I could look forward to {{what you call a}} career. Not that he might be the last of a hundred Traffords, not that he might be an Earl or a Marquis like his forefathers, not that he might some day live to be a wealthy peer, would I have it so,--but because he would be yours and mine." [...] Now she got up, and threw her arms around him, and stood leaning on him as he spoke. [...] "I can look forward to that and think of a career. If that cannot be, the rest of it must provide for itself. There are others who can look after the Traffords,--and who will do so whether it be {{necessary}} or not. To have gone a little out of the beaten path, to have escaped some of the traditional absurdities, would have been something to me. To have let the world see how noble a Countess I could find for it--that would have satisfied me. And I had succeeded. I had found one that would really have graced the name. If it is not to be so,--why then let the name and family go on in the old beaten track. I shall not make another venture. I have made my choice, and it is to come to this." ...|$|E

6000|$|A large, warm tear splashed {{down on his}} knee, and, miserable as he was, Mowgli felt {{happy that}} he was <b>so</b> miserable, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{understand}} that upside-down sort of happiness. [...] "As Chil the Kite used Akela," [...] he repeated, [...] "on the night I saved the Pack from Red Dog." [...] He {{was quiet for a}} little, thinking of the last words of the Lone Wolf, which you, of course, remember. [...] "Now Akela said to me many foolish things before he died, for when we die our stomachs change. He said... None the less, I AM of the Jungle!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, girls, {{the first}} thing to do is to eat. Here are {{biscuits}} for some days, and the two bottles of wine, which we must be sparing of. Dick and I have eaten lots of biscuits, and have had some water from a well at a little distance behind the wood. There was a large gourd lying by it which we have taken the liberty of borrowing. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> drink some water <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like, but you must each take a glass of wine. You must keep up your strength. There is no one in sight, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go to the well and have a wash. Don't be longer than <b>you</b> <b>can</b> help; it would be ruin to be seen before we have changed our clothes. While you are away washing, Dick and I will put on our dresses, and when you come back <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do the same. We can stain our faces and hands afterward." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{sent them}} thus to their death?" [...] gasped Francesco, rising {{to his feet}} and eyeing his cousin with mingled wonder and anger. [...] "You sent men of such {{families}} as these to the headsman, without a trial?

5000|$|Ketch Secor, whose group Old Crow Medicine Show {{started with}} busking and remains {{committed}} to it, has said: [...] "People … have short attention spans. … <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get 'em to stop … {{if you can get}} 'em to listen with a song, then you've got yourself a keeper." ...|$|E
50|$|We {{have the}} {{tendency}} {{to believe that if}} an expert says something, then it must be true.

5000|$|I don’t {{know about}} the whole thing, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> tell me what it’s about that would be nice...I haven’t even noticed if I touched {{somebody}}.

"I {{will call}} upon her, and if I can {{possibly}} manage it, I will ask her myself {{to make one}} of your party. <b>If</b> <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> go to her afterwards and make your own arrangements. Just write her a note, my dear, and say that I will call to-morrow at twelve. It might fluster her if I were to go in without notice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{of course}} you will; you'll go to the Rhine, and Switzerland, and Como, and Rome, and those sort of places. It'll be very nice: we went there--your uncle and I--and it was delightful; only I used to be very tired. It wasn't {{then we went to}} Rome though. I {{remember}} now it was after Adolphus was born. Poor Adolphus!" [...] and her ladyship sighed, as her thoughts went back to the miseries of her eldest born. [...] "But I'll tell you why I sent for you, my dear: you know, I must go downstairs to receive Lord Ballindine, and tell him how glad I am that he's come back; and I'm sure I am very glad that he's coming; and your uncle will be there. But I was thinking you'd perhaps sooner see him first alone. You'll be a little flurried, my dear,--that's natural; <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> remain up here, my dear, in my room, quiet and comfortable, by yourself; and Griffiths shall show Lord Ballindine upstairs, as soon as he leaves the drawing-room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Romola, {{have you}} now {{had time to}} recover calmness? <b>If</b> <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> supply your want of belief in me by a little {{rational}} inference: <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see, I presume, that if I had had any intention of furthering Spini's plot, I should now {{be aware that the}} possession of a fair Piagnone for my wife, who knows the secret of the plot, would be a serious obstacle in my way." ...|$|R
