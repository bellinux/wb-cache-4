500|$|There were 15 {{recorded}} {{takes on}} June 16. By now the song had evolved into its familiar form, in 4/4 time with Dylan on electric guitar. After the fourth take—the master take that was released as a single—Wilson happily commented, [...] "That <b>sounds</b> <b>good</b> to me." [...] Despite this, Dylan {{and the band}} recorded the song 11 more times.|$|E

Unlike every other band in rock we chose to be anonymous. The answer that makes me <b>sound</b> <b>good</b> would probably also incorporate some lengthy discussion about Brechtian alienation techniques, about our post modernistgrasp of ever cooling universe, and a dehumanising society encapsulated in the somewhat paramilitary aspect of our clothing. All of those things would make me <b>sound</b> <b>good,</b> but actually we’re really boring guys." [...] Humphrey B. Flaubert ...|$|R

On 1 February: [...] "Sergeant Pepper <b>sounds</b> <b>good.</b> Paul tells me that I will get {{royalties}} on the song—great news, now perhaps a new home." [...] On 2 February: [...] "Recording voices on Captain [...] Pepper. All six of us doing the chorus in the middle, worked until about midnight." ...|$|E
500|$|The mixing {{started at}} Chalice Recording Studios, but moved to Grohl's house as {{engineer}} Alan Moulder {{said it was}} the way [...] "to make it sound like your garage." [...] Since Grohl's mixing console was not automated, at times four people—Vig, Grohl, Moulder and engineer James Brown—had to work simultaneously on the board, something Grohl found interesting because every song was done differently and [...] "even the mixes sounded like performances" [...] The mixes were tested out in the cars of the band members and Vig, as they felt that [...] "if it <b>sounds</b> <b>good</b> on a lousy stereo, it will sound good anywhere".|$|E
500|$|Critical acclaim for {{the album}} {{did not fully}} {{transpire}} until many decades after its release. AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album 4.5 out 5 stars, saying the album fails to [...] "yield the same results as the other records." [...] He examined that their music mostly repeated past formula and that since the band was still in its prime [...] "such nondescript material <b>sounds</b> <b>good,</b> but the record has neither the exuberant energy or abundant hooks." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau wrote that the band was constantly [...] "topping itself", and implied that each track on the album was very listenable except [...] "Bad Brain", the theme of which he called [...] "repetitious".|$|E

500|$|According to {{producer}} Nigel Wright, {{the lead}} actors would first sing the numbers {{backed by a}} band and orchestra, [...] "then they would go off with Alan and David in a more intimate recording environment and perfect their vocals". However, more trouble arose as Madonna was not comfortable with laying down a [...] "guide vocal" [...] simultaneously with an 84 piece orchestra inside the studio. Also, unlike her previous soundtrack releases, she had little to no control over the project; [...] "I'm used to writing my own songs and I go into a studio, choose the musicians and say what <b>sounds</b> <b>good</b> or doesn't... To work on 46 songs with everyone involved and not have a big say was a big adjustment", she recalled.|$|E
500|$|Two decades later, {{the song}} {{received}} positive reviews from critics. [...] Jose F. Promis from Allmusic commented that [...] "years later [...] still sounded as fresh and innocent as {{when it was}} first released". [...] Stewart Mason, also from Allmusic, commented that the song is an unexpected departure from the group's previous dance-oriented sound, comparing it with Spandau Ballet's [...] "True", adding that [...] "Bailey is not actually technically very good, but he's clearly trying very hard", and felt that the song [...] "is a bit labored [...] but overall, 'Hold Me Now' [...] deserved its huge hit status". [...] Raymond Fiore from Entertainment Weekly said that the song [...] "still <b>sounds</b> <b>good</b> today" [...] and called it [...] "the sound of new wave-pop brilliance". [...] In 2005 the song ranked #308 in Blenders list of the 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born, describing it as [...] "a new wave let's-stay-together plea" [...] that is [...] "so cornball it works".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} not {{finished}} until {{the night before}} mastering. Chater had a flight to New York City at 7:30 in the morning. Di Blasi stated, [...] "so we’re in the studio till 6:30 that morning till he literally was like ‘I gotta go man, I gotta hop on the plane.’ We were like, ‘we think it <b>sounds</b> <b>good.</b> Fuck it.’" [...] Many tracks the Avalanches considered for Wildflower {{did not make it}} into the album because they did not contribute to its overall style. Collaborators on these songs included Jens Lekman, Connan Mockasin, [...] August Darnell, and Luke Steele. Once the style was more defined, they picked from tracks they had worked on which fell in line with others, similar to making a mix tape. The group intends to release these recordings that were closely related to Wildflower [...] "within a year or so" [...] of the album's release. This will help them [...] "clean the slate" [...] for new music to be made.|$|E

But yeah, last week we sat around and they played me some new stuff they're working on, and it <b>sounds</b> <b>good.</b> Sounds like it's got a lot of promise, and really they just need me in the fuckin' practice room. So all {{this is going to happen}} this year. It has to happen. I know there's a responsibility here. Down has a fanbase and they are very very very loyal. So I don't want to let those people down. They deserve some new music, we have it. We've demoed other songs, there's songs that haven't even been released that people have never heard, so there's always Down there. For all you people out there, don't you stress. We got the Down coming." ...|$|E
500|$|Giving {{the album}} {{three out of}} five stars, Ben Ratliff from Rolling Stone {{summarized}} that the messages on the album are dour, but complimented Madonna for talking about the then-current situation of the nation. Johny Davis from NME gave the album a rating of seven out of ten, saying that technically the album <b>sounds</b> <b>good,</b> but overall it felt like an unnecessary sequel to Madonna's previous endeavors like Ray of Light and Music. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated that American Life is better for what it promises than what it delivers, {{and that it is}} better in theory than practice. Kelefa Sanneh from Blender awarded the album three stars out of five. [...] "Just as disjointed as Music and much more severe... Without a compelling back story, her songs seem diminished". Dorian Lynskey from Q magazine also rated it three out of five, stating [...] "'Nothing Fails', the album's centerpiece, is as good a showstopper as 'Live to Tell'... it's no wonder that a record about feeling confused ends up sounding confused".|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the film's songs and soundtrack began on September 1995, and {{took place at}} the CTS Studios in London with Madonna accompanied by co-actors Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce. However, trouble arose as Madonna was not completely comfortable with laying down a [...] "guide vocal" [...] simultaneously with an 84 piece orchestra inside the studio. She was used to singing over a pre-recorded track and not have musicians listen to her. Also, unlike her previous soundtrack releases, she had little to no control over the project; [...] "I'm used to writing my own songs and I go into a studio, choose the musicians and say what <b>sounds</b> <b>good</b> or doesn't [...] To work on 46 songs with everyone involved and not have a big say was a big adjustment", she recalled. An emergency meeting was held between Parker, Lloyd Webber and Madonna where it was decided that the singer would record her part in a more contemporary studio while the orchestration would take place somewhere else. She also had alternate days off from the recording.|$|E
5000|$|Velasquez {{described}} the album, [...] "For my ideal Christmas album, I wanted {{to record the}} songs I have always loved, done in their original arrangements, to make an album that will <b>sound</b> <b>good</b> now but will also <b>sound</b> <b>good</b> years from now." [...] The related review indicated that the it blends traditional 1950s style arrangements with the pop Velasquez {{had come to be}} known for. Reviewer John DiBiase called it [...] "a creative, fun, traditional Christmas project that will touch the hearts of all ages" [...] and [...] "one of the best-orchestrated Christmas projects put out in the contemporary Christian music to date." ...|$|R
500|$|Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama, {{rating the}} music album a 3 out of 5 stars, {{said that it}} was [...] "a series of {{situational}} songs that should <b>sound</b> <b>good</b> in the film's narrative".|$|R

500|$|Heather Phares of AllMusic {{felt that}} the record was [...] "not simply Debut redux", concluding: [...] "The work of a {{constantly}} changing artist, Post proves that as Björk moves toward more ambitious, complex music, she always surpasses herself". Writing for MTV Online, Lou Stathis wrote that, [...] " [...] Björk's wacky, mind-altered perspective that makes Post modern pop music at once both baffling and engaging". He believed that the album was a rewarding experience for both the casual consumer, {{as well as the}} serious listener, also pointing out that, [...] "it not only <b>sounds</b> <b>good</b> while you're listening to it, but it leaves you feeling good when it's over, too". Robert Christgau, reviewing the album for The Village Voice, was less enthusiastic. He {{felt that the}} singer [...] " [...] primeval suspicion of Europeans who presume to [...] "improve" [...] on rock and roll," [...] criticizing her [...] "self-involved vocal devices" [...] and poor grasp of the English language. He gave Post a C+ rating, meaning he considered it [...] "a not disreputable performance, most likely a failed experiment or a pleasant piece of hackwork." [...] MusicHound awarded the album two out of five stars.|$|E
500|$|According to the film's music {{producer}} Nigel Wright, {{the lead}} actors would first sing the numbers {{backed by a}} band and orchestra before working with Parker and music supervisor David Caddick [...] "in a more intimate recording environment [...] perfect their vocals". More trouble arose as Madonna was not completely comfortable with [...] "laying down a guide vocal simultaneously with an 84-piece orchestra" [...] in the studio. She was used to singing over a pre-recorded track and not having musicians listen to her. Also, unlike her previous soundtrack releases, she had little to no creative control. [...] "I'm used to writing my own songs and I go into a studio, choose the musicians and say what <b>sounds</b> <b>good</b> or doesn't... To work on 46 songs with everyone involved and not have a big say was a big adjustment," [...] she recalled. An emergency meeting was held between Parker, Lloyd Webber and Madonna, where {{it was decided that}} the singer would record her part at Whitfield Street Studios, a contemporary studio, while the orchestration would take place elsewhere. She also had alternate days off from the recording to preserve and strengthen her voice.|$|E
500|$|Albini {{sought to}} produce a record that sounded nothing like Nevermind. [...] He felt the sound of Nevermind was [...] "sort of a {{standard}} hack recording that {{has been turned into}} a very, very controlled, compressed radio-friendly mix [...] That is not, in my opinion, very flattering to a rock band." [...] Instead, the intention was to capture a more natural and visceral sound. [...] Albini refused to double-track Cobain's vocals and instead recorded him singing alone in a resonant room. [...] The producer noted the intensity of the singer's vocals on some tracks; he said, [...] "There's a really dry, really loud voice at the end of 'Milk It'... that was also done at the end of 'Rape Me', where [...] wanted the sound of him screaming to just overtake the whole band." [...] Albini achieved the album's sparse drum sound by simply placing several microphones around the room while Dave Grohl performed, picking up the natural reverberation of the room. [...] Albini explained, [...] "If you take a good drummer and put him in front of a drum kit that <b>sounds</b> <b>good</b> acoustically and just record it, you've done your job." ...|$|E
50|$|Then {{he worked}} on Muppozhudhum Un Karpanaigal {{starring}} Adharvaa, Amala Paul written, directed & produced by a newcomer Elred Kumar. Though the film was technically <b>sounded</b> <b>good</b> it bombed in the box office due to its poor content.|$|R
