He also expressed his concern that the foreign aid bill that was being tabled in US Congress could be halted due to negative sentiment over Diệm's repressions of the Buddhists. During the visit, Lodge reiterated in his cables to Washington that he felt that an <b>aid</b> <b>suspension</b> could backfire on the United States by alienating the population {{as well as the}} regime. Aware that an <b>aid</b> <b>suspension</b> was a potential recommendation of the mission's report, the USAID director Brent also openly expressed his concerns over such move. Both opinions were regarded as important because McNamara and Taylor had been specifically charged by the Kennedy with examining ways to make American aid better facilitate US foreign policy goals objectives. Lodge and Brent tabled papers which included a program-by-program consideration of the impact of an <b>aid</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|R

40|$|Under what {{conditions}} are foreign aid donors willing to suspend foreign aid to punish political transgressions, such as election fraud, corruption scandals or political repression? Prior scholarship has emphasized that political sanctions, including foreign <b>aid</b> <b>suspensions,</b> are {{constrained by the}} geostrategic considerations of donor countries. However, foreign <b>aid</b> <b>suspensions</b> often occur in strategically important countries, and donors respond differently to different types of political transgressions within the same county. To shed light on this puzzle, in this article, I present evidence from an original survey of top-level donor representatives in 20 African countries, including a list experiment designed to elicit truthful responses about {{the conditions under which}} donors are willing to suspend foreign aid. I argue that the likelihood of a foreign <b>aid</b> <b>suspension</b> depends not only on the strategic considerations of the donor government, but also on the institutional incentives of the donor agency. A donor agency's institutional incentives are shaped by the agency's organizational design, as well as by its foreign aid portfolio in the recipient country...|$|R

40|$|Coups d’état are {{a type of}} {{political}} instability that involves a sitting ruler being overthrown {{by his or her}} own military or other elite within the state apparatus. Coups are commonly viewed as a threat to democracy. Policy makers in donor countries have taken action in line with this belief by implementing foreign <b>aid</b> <b>suspension</b> policies in regard to states that recently experienced a coup. More recent research, however, shows that coups may actually promote democracy; particularly in long-standing autocratic states. In these circumstances, the new democracies may benefit more from an increase in aid, as opposed to <b>suspension</b> of <b>aid.</b> In the present study, I investigate whether successful coups and the level of democracy affect development aid receipts. Based on relevant literature, I developed a model to predict development aid receipt. The model includes successful coups, democracy level, as well as various economic and social indicators as explanatory variables. I evaluated coups and development aid during the time period 1960 to 2007. Panel data was constructed using data from th...|$|R

40|$|In Sub-Saharan Africa, {{one of the}} world’s poorest regions, governments heavily {{rely upon}} donor Aid in order to sustain their {{national}} budgets and address the exacerbation of poverty. Malawi, {{one of the poorest}} countries in the region is no exception and part of the cause of the poverty is donor <b>aid</b> <b>suspension.</b> The United Nation’s World Food Programme (WFP) in Malawi introduced the School Feeding programme in 1999. The intention was to reduce dropout rates, promote regular attendance, increase enrolment, and improve children’s ability to concentrate and learn, and improve government capacity to implement a school meals programme. During the period between 2007 and 2011, the WFP announced the temporary suspension of the programme for half a million children in 10 of the 13 Malawian Districts of which the Chirazdulu district was one. Since the suspension of the programme, no proper study has been conducted to indicate the bearing of the suspension. The {{purpose of the study was}} to explore in which ways <b>suspension</b> of <b>Aid</b> provision by the WFP from 2007 to 2011 affected the school meals programme and the socio-economic status of the beneficiaries of the programme in the Chiradzulu district in Malawi. Participants in the study were three teachers at two schools where the programme is offered and four parents from the two schools who were involved in the administration of the programme. A qualitative research approached was used and a case study design was applied at two schools in the Chiradzulu district where the WFP’s school meals programme was implemented. Semi-structure interview schedules that were pre-tested were used during the individual interviews conducted with parents and teachers. The school meals programme is still implemented at the two schools today. The main findings revealed that donor <b>aid</b> <b>suspension</b> affected the continued implementation of the school meals programme and the socio-economic wellbeing of the programme’s beneficiaries. There was a reduction in school attendance by learners, increased absenteeism, evidence of malnourishment amongst learners and increasing pressure on parents to provide breakfast for the learners before they went to school. For the programme to have a sustainable impact it is recommended that its implementation must not be interrupted by <b>aid</b> <b>suspension,</b> the programme must be expanded but remain targeted and not become universal and the Malawi government assume full responsibility of the programme and stop reliance on foreign funding...|$|R

The recommendations for <b>aid</b> <b>suspensions</b> and the announcement of US troop withdrawals were designed as measures that would foster doubt within the Diệm regime about American intentions and incentives for policy changes. The fact that such sanctions would be seen by the ARVN generals as a signal of American willingness to accept alternative leadership, in other words, a coup, was not recognized in the recommendation, since the report specifically ruled out American encouragement of [...] "a change of government".

50|$|Although {{despite the}} <b>suspension</b> of <b>aid</b> to the PA, {{aid to the}} OPT {{reportedly}} increased during 2006, poverty climbed sharply during the same period. According to Oxfam, this was because international aid did not compensate for the substantial loss of income created by the withholding of at least $475m of Palestinian tax and customs revenues by Israel. This accounted for around 50% of the PA’s monthly income in 2005. Also, the aid came late, it did not generate income, and was less effective. Moreover, the boycott has helped to trigger factional violence between Palestinians. Oxfam observed in 2006 dropping incomes, increased poverty, institutional collapse and economic decline. Media reports suggested that the humanitarian situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip was worsening.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{proposes a}} systematic and effective optimization {{process for the}} design of vertical passive suspension of light rail vehicles (LRVs) using new constrained multiobjective evolution algorithms. A multibody dynamic model of the three-car train set is presented and the suspension spring and damping parameters are optimally designed. A new design of the passive <b>suspension</b> is <b>aided</b> by the use of evolution algorithms to attain the best compromise between ride quality and suspension deflections due to irregular gradient tracks. Extensive simulations are performed to verify the proposed design scheme. The preliminary results show that, when the passive suspension is optimized via the proposed approach, a substantial improvement in the vertical ride quality is obtained while keeping the suspension deflections within their allowable clearance when the light rail vehicle runs onto the worst track condition.
