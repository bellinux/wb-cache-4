5|$|All trips {{made with}} a SmarTrip card, with the {{exception}} of bus transfers and passes, are charged as individual one-way fares. WMATA offers discounted rail and bus passes to customers who make several trips in one day, or many trips, or many short trips, in a seven-day period or calendar month; however, SmarTrip users must manually load each transit pass onto their SmarTrip cards or sign up for an autoload of the pass in advance. This is in contrast to the Oyster card <b>system</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> London Underground, for example, where fares are automatically capped to ensure that customers never pay more than the cost of a one-day pass each day.|$|E
5|$|He {{became a}} friend and {{correspondent}} of Eduard Douwes Dekker, who under the pseudonym Multatuli published Max Havelaar, the 1860 satire that exposed colonial corruption in Java; Dekker {{was one of the}} first subscribers to Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indië. Another acquaintance was W.

40|$|We study certain {{two-dimensional}} variational systems, namely pluri-Lagrangian <b>systems</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> root lattice Q(A_N).

5|$|In 1844, the London and Croydon Railway {{was given}} {{parliamentary}} authority to test an experimental pneumatic propulsion <b>system</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> railway (referred {{to at the}} time as the atmospheric-propulsion system). A pumping station was built on Portland Road; this created a vacuum in a pipe paralleling the railway tracks. A piston extended downwards from the trains into a slit in the pipe, meaning that trains were literally sucked towards the pumping station or blown away from it. The pumping station was built in a Gothic style, with a very tall ornate tower which served both as a chimney and as an exhaust vent for air pumped from the propulsion pipe.|$|E
5|$|In response, SMRT {{announced}} it was replacing important engineering components on all C151 trains by 2019. This included changing the existing Mitsubishi Electric propulsion system for the newer Insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) propulsion system by Toshiba, technology currently used in the Tokyo Metro's 1000 series and 16000 series trains {{as well as the}} Kyushu 305 series and Hankyu 1000 series trains. As of July 2015, train sets 055/056 and 131/132 are trialed with the new propulsion system. In tandem with the replacement of the signalling <b>system</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> East-West Line and North-South Line with the newer Thales SelTrac signalling system, new equipment are installed in the passenger compartment of the trailer cars.|$|E

5|$|On July 1, the US Far East Command {{directed}} the Eighth United States Army to {{assume responsibility for}} all logistical support of the United States and UN forces in Korea. including the ROK Army.

The biggest challenge was a shortage of ammunition. Though logistics situations improved over time, ammunition was short {{for much of the}} war. Consumption of supplies differed among the various units and a lack of a previously drafted plan forced UN logisticians to create a <b>system</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fly.|$|E

5|$|On May 18, 1980, a major {{volcanic}} eruption occurred at Mount St. Helens, a volcano located in Skamania County, {{in the state}} of Washington, United States. The eruption (a VEI 5 event) was the most significant {{volcanic eruption}} to occur in the contiguous 48 U.S. states since the 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak in California. It has often been declared as the most disastrous volcanic eruption in United States history. The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes, caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the volcano that created a large bulge and a fracture <b>system</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mountain's north slope.|$|E

5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} by a single balanced rudder, which gave the ships excellent maneuverability. The rudder was augmented with special steering <b>system</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> engine transmissions; they had gears that could drive half of the engines astern and half forward allowed the screws to assist in turning the ship at sharper angles. The ships tended toward lee helm in general conditions, but in heavy wind, they suffered from weather helm. Both vessels also suffered from severe leeway at low speeds, and the effect was especially pronounced for Nürnberg, owing to her larger superstructure.|$|E
