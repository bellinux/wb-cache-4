5|$|Initially, {{the crew}} {{are unaware of}} the loop. However, Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) begins to hear noises before she goes to bed {{following}} the poker game. Having a sense of déjà vu during the poker game and able to predict the cards Data will deal during a subsequent loop, Crusher takes a tricorder with her to her room, records the voices, and later analyzes them to discover they are the panicked commands and broadcasts of the crew. The senior staff work out that they are stuck in the loop; the voices they are hearing are those of themselves from the previous loop {{just prior to the}} destruction of the ship. They evaluate the voices to determine that the loop is restarted due to the collision of the two ships but {{do not know how to}} avoid that collision in the first place. Data suggests that his positronic brain can be used to send a <b>short</b> <b>message</b> to himself in the next loop which may help them to avoid the collision.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} content-based spam filtering for <b>short</b> text <b>messages</b> that arise in three contexts: mobile (SMS) communication, blog comments, and email summary information such as might be displayed by a low-bandwidth client. <b>Short</b> <b>messages</b> often consist {{of only a few}} words, and therefore present a challenge to traditional bag-of-words based spam filters. Using three corpora of <b>short</b> <b>messages</b> and message fields derived from real SMS, blog, and spam messages, we evaluate feature-based and compression-model-based spam filters. We observe that bag-of-words filters can be improved substantially using different features, while compression-model filters perform quite well as-is.

40|$|The Cyclic Redundancy Code (CRC) in {{a network}} message forms a primary defense against system failures. Because {{embedded}} systems often operate in noisy environments, {{it is vital that}} CRC polynomials be selected to be optimal with respect to detecting errors in expected traffic workloads. Unfortunately, most standard CRCs do not perform well for the <b>short</b> <b>messages</b> that are commonly sent in embedded system applications, and in general were apparently not designed with <b>short</b> <b>messages</b> in mind. This paper describes a methodology to determine an optimal CRC polynomial for applications using <b>short</b> <b>messages.</b> Additionally, standard 16 -bit CRC polynomials are shown to be grossly suboptimal in error detection performance for <b>short</b> <b>messages.</b> Our methodology has identified an optimal 12 -bit CRC that yields better error detection than the widely used CCITT 16 -bit CRC for embedded network workloads having typical message lengths of 64 bits. Adoption of optimal CRCs would provide improved cost/detection performance tradeoffs for new dependable embedded system designs. 1...|$|R
25|$|Some {{cassettes}} {{were made}} to play a continuous loop of tape without stopping. Lengths available are from around 30 seconds to a standard full length. They are used in situations where a <b>short</b> <b>message</b> or musical jingle is to be played, either continuously or whenever a device is triggered, or whenever continuous recording or playing is needed. Some include a sensing foil on the tape to allow tape players to re-cue. From as early as 1969 various patents have been issued, covering such uses as uni-directional, bi-directional, and compatibility with auto-shut-off and anti-tape-eating mechanisms. One variant has a half-width loop of tape for an answering machine outgoing message, and another half-width tape on spools to record incoming messages.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the aggressive signals received from Kattegat, Seip signalled back a <b>short</b> <b>message</b> telling the German crew to abandon ship within 10 minutes or face the consequences. At {{the end of the}} ten minutes no reaction from the German crew had been observed and Nordkapp fired a warning shot. As still no reaction could be seen in the protruding darkness, four 47mm rounds were fired into Kattegat's waterline. As the Germans had opened their ship's valves while leaving the tanker, Kattegat sank quickly. Thirty-four of the crew were brought on board Nordkapp as PoWs from a nearby wharf, while the remaining five managed to escape into the hills after their ship was sunk. The 34 PoWs from the German tanker were brought to Mosjøen and handed over to military authorities there.|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{vehicles}} are sent on runs {{by a number}} of means. The most common system is by pager, issued to every crew. Pagers may operate on either an analog or a digital system. Analog pagers will silently listen on the air for a 5-tone signal being transmitted. Once the individual signal for that pager is detected, the pager will sound an alarm, and will often open the channel for the crew to hear the dispatcher. Further information is being given via radio. The digital pagers will listen on a different channel and once its individual address is transmitted, will prepare to receive a data package. This package normally consists of a <b>short</b> <b>message,</b> providing the address and nature of the emergency as well as additional information. This clears the radio channel of lengthy calls. Theoretically, no additional radio traffic is required when using such a system.|$|E

500|$|Comverse {{became a}} market leader in voice {{messaging}} software and boomed {{during the late}} 1990s with the surge in mobile phone use. [...] Much of its market focus was on wireless operators and overseas companies, and it gained a formidable position in the worldwide mobile voicemail management market. The growth coincided with SMS text messages becoming popular; the first big application for SMS was as a notification mechanism to tell a wireless subscriber that voicemail were stored in a voicemail box. [...] Comverse expanded this application into a full-blown <b>short</b> <b>message</b> service center (SMSC), which receives, buffers, processes, and dispatches all SMS messages throughout a mobile network. [...] Comverse branded and productised this as the Intelligent <b>Short</b> <b>Message</b> Service Center, or ISMSC. [...] Typical of telecomm software, it ran on Unix-based platforms, such as UnixWare and later Linux. [...] Comverse's ISMSC found success as a lower-price solution for lower-traffic networks, where it competed with Logica's Telepath solution. [...] Other companies in the SMSC space included CMG and Openwave. [...] ISMSC found considerable market penetration, exemplified by all six of Hong Kong's wireless carriers using it.|$|E

We show in this paper how self-organizing ad-hoc networks {{can be used to}} provide the <b>short</b> <b>messaging</b> service, at a much lower price. We propose a routing protocol for wireless messaging networks, which explores the characteristics of adhoc network routing in which mobile nodes are allowed to relay in place of static nodes. We demonstrate, using simulations, how this increases connectivity in the network and decreases the required node density for full connectivity. As our scheme relies on the delay tolerant properties of <b>short</b> <b>messages,</b> we explore the delay characteristics of our routing scheme as well. ...|$|R
