5|$|The prepatellar bursa and the {{olecranon}} bursa {{are the two}} bursae {{that are}} most likely to become infected, or septic. <b>Septic</b> <b>bursitis</b> typically occurs when the trauma to the knee causes an abrasion, though it is also possible for the infection to be caused by bacteria traveling through the blood from a pre-existing infection site. In approximately 80% of septic cases, the infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus; other common infections are Streptococcus, Mycobacterium, and Brucella. It is highly unusual for <b>septic</b> <b>bursitis</b> to be caused by anaerobes, fungi, or Gram-negative bacteria. In very rare cases, the infection can be caused by tuberculosis.|$|E

40|$|Olecranon {{bursitis}} {{is relatively}} common. One third of episodes are septic. Most {{of the remainder}} are non-septic, with occasional rheumatological causes. Trauma can cause both septic and non-septic olecranon bursitis. Clinical features are helpful in separating septic from non-septic olecranon bursitis, {{but there may be}} local erythema in both. Aspiration should be carried out in all cases, and if the presence of infection is still in doubt, microscopy, Gram staining, and culture of the aspirate will resolve the issue. <b>Septic</b> olecranon <b>bursitis</b> should be treated by aspiration, which may need to be repeated, and a long course of antibiotics. Some cases will need admission, and a few will need surgical treatment. Non-septic olecranon bursitis can be managed with aspiration alone.

5|$|A {{physical}} examination and medical history {{are generally not}} enough to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious bursitis; aspiration of the bursal fluid is often required for this, along with a cell culture and Gram stain of the aspirated fluid. <b>Septic</b> prepatellar <b>bursitis</b> may be diagnosed if the fluid is {{found to have a}} neutrophil count above 1500 per microliter, a threshold significantly lower than that of septic arthritis (50,000 cells per microliter).

500|$|Opinions vary as {{to which}} {{treatment}} options are most effective for <b>septic</b> prepatellar <b>bursitis.</b> McAfee and Smith recommend a course of oral antibiotics, usually oxacillin sodium or cephradine, and assert that surgery and drainage are unnecessary. Wilson-MacDonald argues that oral antibiotics are [...] "inadequate", and recommends intravenous antibiotics for managing the infection. Some authors suggest surgical irrigation of the bursa {{by means of a}} subcutaneous tube. Others suggest that bursectomy may be necessary for intractable cases; the operation is an outpatient procedure that can be performed in less than half an hour.|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} with <b>septic</b> <b>bursitis</b> the indications for admission and surgical intervention remain unclear, and practice has varied widely. The {{effectiveness of a}} conservative outpatient based approach was assessed by an outcome study in a prospective case series. Consecutive patients attending an emergency department with acute swelling of the olecranon or prepatellar bursa were managed according to a structured approach, subjective and objective outcomes being assessed after two to three days, and subsequently as required until clinical discharge. Long-term outcomes were assessed by telephone follow-up for up to eighteen months. 47 patients {{were included in the}} study: 22 had <b>septic</b> <b>bursitis,</b> 15 of the olecranon bursa and 7 of the prepatellar bursa. The mean visual analogue pain scores of those with <b>septic</b> <b>bursitis</b> improved from 4. 8 at presentation to 1. 7 at first follow-up for olecranon bursitis, and from 3. 8 to 2. 7 for prepatellar bursitis.

40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this report}} is to alert physicians about how pro-longed the course of treatment for recalcitrant <b>septic</b> olecranon <b>bursitis</b> (OB) might be when only oral antibiotics are used.

We treated a 56 -year-old healthy male who developed methicillin-sensitive Staphylo-coccus aureus (MSSA) OB after a scorpion sting. The infection was not eradicated with bursectomy and a conventional course of antibiotics. The unusual persistence of the infection was initially attributed to venom, but olecranon osteomyelitis was eventually suspected.

40|$|Introduction: Septic {{olecranon}} bursitis due to atypical mycobacteria is rare. An insidious beginning can delay diagnosis and treatment. Antibacterial therapy recommendations are not well-defined for bursitis caused by atypical mycobacteria. We present a rare case of {{olecranon bursitis}} caused by Mycobacterium gordonae, reporting our experiences regarding pathogen identification and antibiotic therapy, which differs from regimes used in common <b>septic</b> <b>bursitis</b> mostly caused by staphylococcus aureus. 				 					Methods: A 35 -year-old male with bursitis olecrani received open bursectomy. Microbiological culture {{did not reveal}} bacteria. Due to wound healing complications revision surgery was performed four weeks postoperatively. Finally, Mycobacterium gordonae was identified by PCR and an antibiogram could be developed. A triple antimicrobial combination therapy with Rifampicin, Clarithromycin, and Ethambutol was administered systemically for 12 months. The patient was followed-up for 24 months. 				 					Results: After the second operation with pathogen identification and antibiotic combination therapy the wound healed without any additional complications. At last follow-up 24 months after the first surgery with bursectomy and 23 months after revision surgery with debridement, the patient was still pain free with no significant clinical findings or tenderness to touch at the operation site. Elbow range of motion was full. 				 					Discussion: As <b>septic</b> <b>bursitis</b> {{can be caused by}} many different and sometimes rare and difficult to identify bacteria, intraoperative probes should be taken and histopathological and microbiological analysis should be conducted, including PCR.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionNontuberculous {{mycobacteria}} are {{an uncommon}} cause of <b>septic</b> olecranon <b>bursitis,</b> though cases have increasingly {{been described in}} both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. Guidelines recommend a combination of surgical resection and antimicrobials for treatment. This case is the first reported case of nontuberculous mycobacterial olecranon bursitis that resolved without medical or surgical intervention. Case presentationA 67 -year-old female developed a painless, fluctuant swelling of the olecranon bursa following blunt trauma to the elbow. Due to persistent bursal swelling, she underwent three separate therapeutic bursal aspirations, two involving intrabursal steroid injection. After the third aspiration, the bursa became erythematous and severely swollen, and bursal fluid grew Mycobacterium avium complex. Triple-drug antimycobacterial therapy was initiated, but discontinued abruptly due to a rash. Surgery was not performed. The patient was observed off antimicrobials, and gradually clinically improved with a compressive dressing. By 14 months after initial presentation, clinical exam revealed complete resolution of the previously erythematous bursal mass. DiscussionThis is the first reported case of nontuberculous mycobacterial olecranon bursitis managed successfully without surgery or antimicrobials. Musculoskeletal nontuberculous mycobacterial infections are challenging {{given the lack of}} clinical data about optimal duration and choice of antimicrobials or the role of surgery. Additionally, the potential toxicity and drug interactions of antimycobacterials are not insignificant and warrant close monitoring if treatment is pursued. ConclusionThis case raises an important clinical question of whether close observation off antimicrobials is appropriate in select cases of immunocompetent patients with localized atypical mycobacterial disease of soft tissue and skeletal structures...|$|R
30|$|Of the 21 {{patients}} who underwent multiple surgeries, 14 children (66.7 Â %) required two I&Ds, two children (9.5 Â %) required three, and one child (4.8 Â %) required four I&Ds. Three {{patients who}} presented critically ill underwent six, six, and eight surgeries, respectively, for eradication of infection; additionally, these patients required further surgery for {{delayed primary closure}} and/or suture removal under anesthesia. One final patient underwent two I&Ds during their index hospitalization, was later readmitted with recurrent septic arthritis in the same joint, and required an additional three surgeries. These children had aggressive organisms, developed septic arthritis in additional joints, and/or progressed to osteomyelitis or intra-muscular abscesses that were not apparent at initial presentation. The distribution of joints which required multiple surgeries included the hip (38.1 Â %), knee (28.6 Â %), ankle (4.8 Â %), and wrist (4.8 Â %). Two children (9.5 Â %) progressed to bilateral septic hips and one (4.8 Â %) progressed to bilateral septic knees when only one side was infected originally. One child (4.8 Â %) presented with a hip septic arthritis and then developed a contralateral hip <b>septic</b> trochanteric <b>bursitis,</b> and one child (4.8 Â %) who presented with bilateral septic hips required repeat surgery of both hips. The distribution of infected joints was similar between the multiple surgeries cohort and the entire study population; {{this study did not}} demonstrate a particular joint that was more prone to persistent infection. The median length of hospital stay for patients who required one or multiple surgeries was 6 Â days [interquartile range (IQR)Â =Â  3] and 13 Â days (IQRÂ =Â  17), respectively (zÂ =Â â 6.15; pÂ =Â  0.000).

40|$|Because of its {{subcutaneous}} location prepatellar bursitis {{is frequently}} complicated by an infection.

A 71 -year-old male was admitted to our department with a history of pain and swelling of his right knee over a 20 year period. Physical examination revealed a swollen, suppurative mass with ulceration of the skin and local erythema which mimicked a soft tissue tumor at first sight. Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee revealed a 13 * 12 * 10 cm well-circumscribed, septated, capsulated, fluid-filled prepatellar bursa without evidence of tendinous or muscular invasion.

Aim of the workThe aim of the current case reports is to describe the clinical and the magnetic resonance imaging features of acute gouty olecranon bursitis as initial presentation of acute gouty attack. Case reportIn this report we describe the clinical and MRI features of three cases presenting with acute gouty olecranon bursitis, in spite of normal serum uric acid and stable renal function. For all cases diagnostic aspiration was carried out to exclude <b>septic</b> <b>bursitis</b> as initial first step of management. The bursal fluid was also examined under Polarized microscopy and monosodium urate crystals were identified in the aspirated fluid with typical negative birefringence typical for urate crystals. The literature on MRI features of olecranon bursitis as atypical presentation of gout is reviewed. ConclusionOlcernaon gouty bursitis can be the initial presentation of acute gouty attack and {{should be considered in}} the differential diagnosis in acute presentation after exclusion of sepsis. The importance of bursal fluid analysis in such atypical presentation to look for monosodium urate crystals and excluding bacterial infection is quite important clinical task in such atypical presentation...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE. To {{describe}} {{an outbreak of}} invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection after percutaneous needle procedures (acupuncture and joint injection) performed by a single medical practitioner. SETTING. A medical practitioner's office and 4 hospitals in Perth, Western Australia. PATIENTS. Eight individuals who developed invasive MRSA infection after acupuncture or joint injection performed by the medical practitioner. METHODS. Weperformed a prospective and retrospective outbreak investigation, including MRSA colonization surveillance, environmental sampling for MRSA, and detailed molecular typing of MRSA isolates. We performed an infection control audit of the medical practitioner's premises and practices and administered MRSA decolonization therapy to the medical practitioner. RESULTS. Eight cases of invasive MRSA infection were identified. Seven cases occurred as a cluster in May 2004; another case (identified retrospectively) occurred approximately 15 months earlier in February 2003. The primary sites of infection were the neck, shoulder, lower back, and hip: 5 patients had <b>septic</b> arthritis and <b>bursitis,</b> and 3 had pyomyositis; 3 patients had bacteremia, including 1 patient with possible endocarditis. The medical practitioner {{was found to be}} colonized with the same MRSA clone [ST 22 -MRSA-IV (EMRSA- 15) ] at 2 time points: shortly after the first case of infection in March 2003 and again in May 2004. After the medical practitioner's premises and practices were audited and he himself received MRSA decolonization therapy, no further cases were identified. CONCLUSIONS. This outbreak most likely resulted from a breakdown in sterile technique during percutaneous needle procedures, resulting in the transmission of MRSA from the medical practitioner to the patients.

After this procedure, the cavity size reduced, but the orifice and subcutaneous cavity were not closed. Therefore, additional PRP therapy was conducted after 10 weeks of the first PRP session. Complete closure was achieved 13 weeks after the first PRP therapy. In the present case, PRP was prepared using the KYOCERA Medical PRP Kit, and wound healing of a fistula with subcutaneous cavity following bursitis of the lateral malleolus was successfully cured.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the efficacy, effectiveness {{and safety of}} etanercept, a soluble tumour necrosis factor-alpha receptor, in a prospective observational cohort of patients with refractory psoriatic arthritis and polyarticular involvement. METHODS: Twenty patients with psoriatic arthritis refractory to conventional anti-rheumatic drugs were treated with etanercept 25 mg subcutaneously twice a week for 26 weeks. Efficacy and safety were recorded at weeks 2, 6, 10, 16, 20 and 26. Effectiveness, defined as clinical remission, reduction of 50 % in clinical parameters and concomitant NSAID use, was evaluated at 26 weeks. RESULTS: Etanercept therapy was efficacious in this cohort as 85 % of the patients met the Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criterion at week 26. Effectiveness of etanercept for the individual patient was demonstrated, since at least 50 % of the patients had a 90 and 85 % improvement in swollen and tender joint count, respectively, and a 71 % improvement in the Health Assessment Questionnaire at week 26. Four patients showed complete remission and NSAIDs were stopped in 10 / 15 patients. The most common adverse events were upper respiratory tract infections. Interestingly, in two patients psoriasis worsened during the study, unrelated to the course of arthritis. The administration of etanercept was interrupted in three patients for adverse events: one <b>septic</b> <b>bursitis,</b> one myocardial infarction and one tooth abscess. After resolution of the adverse events, etanercept was successfully reintroduced.

40|$|AbstractThe {{most common}} organisms causing {{prosthetic}} knee joint infections are staphylococci. However, arthroplasty infections with atypical microbial pathogens, such as Mycobacteria can occur. Due to the rarity of mycobacterial prosthetic joint infections, diagnosis, treatment, {{and management of}} these atypical infections represent a clinical challenge. A 71 -year old female post-operative day 40 after a left total knee arthroplasty was hospitalized secondary to left knee pain and suspected arthroplasty infection. She had failed outpatient oral antimicrobial treatment for superficial stitch abscess; and outpatient IV/Oral antimicrobials for a clinical postoperative <b>septic</b> <b>bursitis.</b> Ultimately, resection arthroplasty with operative tissue acid fast bacterial cultures demonstrated growth of the Mycobacterium smegmatis group. Post-operatively, she completed a combination course of oral doxycycline and levofloxacin and successfully completed a replacement arthroplasty with clinical and microbial resolution of the infection. To our knowledge, literature review demonstrates three case of knee arthroplasty infection caused by the Mycobacterium smegmatis group. Correspondingly, optimal surgical procedures and antimicrobial management including antimicrobial selection, treatment duration are not well defined. Presently, the best treatment options consists of two step surgical management including prosthesis hardware removal followed by extended antimicrobial therapy, followed by consideration for re-implantation arthroplasty. Our case illustrates importance of considering atypical mycobacterial infections in post-operative arthroplasty infections not responding to traditional surgical manipulations and antimicrobials. For an arthroplasty infection involving the atypical Mycobacterium smegmatis group, two step arthroplasty revision, including arthroplasty resection, {{with a combination of}} oral doxycycline and levofloxacin can lead to successful infection resolution, allowing for a successful replacement arthroplasty...|$|E
40|$|Objectives No {{evidence-based}} recommendations {{exist for}} the management of infectious bursitis. We examined epidemiology and risk factors for recurrence of <b>septic</b> <b>bursitis.</b> Specifically, we compared outcome in patients receiving bursectomy plus short-course adjuvant antibiotic therapy (â¤ 7 days) with that of patients receiving bursectomy plus longer-course antibiotic therapy (> 7 days). Patients and methods Retrospective study of adult patients with infectious olecranon and patellar bursitis requiring hospitalization at Geneva University Hospital from January 1996 to March 2009. Results We identified 343 episodes of infectious bursitis (237 olecranon and 106 patellar). Staphylococcus aureus predominated among the 256 cases with an identifiable pathogen (85 %). Three hundred and twelve cases (91 %) were treated surgically; 142 (41 %) with one-stage bursectomy and closure and 146 with two-stage bursectomy. All received antibiotics for a median duration of 13 days with a median intravenous component of 3 days. Cure was achieved in 293 (85 %) episodes. Total duration of antibiotic therapy [odds ratio (OR) 0. 9; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 8 - 1. 1] showed no association with cure. In multivariate analysis, only immunosuppression was linked to recurrence (OR 5. 6; 95 % CI 1. 9 - 18. 4).

40|$|Timentin, a {{combination}} of clavulanic acid (0. 1 g) and ticarcillin (3. 0 g), has proved effective in vitro against bacterial pathogens that produce beta-lactamases. The usual etiologic bacteria of osteochondritis of the foot (Pseudomonas species) and osteomyelitis/ septic arthritis (Staphylococcus aureus) are commonly resistant to penicillins. To date, we have used Timentin to treat 30 children with bone, joint, and deepsofttissueinfections. Timentin was administered intravenously at an average dosage of 207 mg/kg per day for mild to moderate infection and 310 mg/kg per day for bone and jointinfections with systemic signs (sepsis). The lower dose was used in 24 patients and the other six patients, who had signs of sepsis, received the higher dose. All patients received Timentin intravenously over 30 minutes every four to six hours {{for a minimum of}} five days (mean 6. 6 Â± 2. 6 days, range five to 14 days). The mean time to defervescence and/or reduction in clinical symptoms was 1. 6 Â± 1. 3 days (range zero to four days). Osteochondritis due to P. aeruginosa was diagnosed in six patients, and <b>septic</b> <b>bursitis,</b> osteomyelitis, or septic arthritis due to S. aureus (13 patients) or Staphylococcus species and group A streptococci (four patients) was diagnosed in 17 patients. All isolates were susceptible to Timentin in vitro by disk-diffusion analysis. All patients showed a response to therapy with Timentin, with or without surgical intervention. All patients had clinical and microbiologic cures; no adverse reactions or side effects were observed. There have been no clinical or microbiologic relapses to date. Timentin may prove to be useful in specific bone and jointinfections in children...|$|E
40|$|The current medical climate {{has forced}} all health care {{providers}} to search for alternative methods for the delivery of health care. This search {{has led to the}} use of sites outside the conventional hospital walls for peritoneal dialysis, parenteral hyperalimentation, blood or blood product transfusions, etc. Home intravenous self-injection of antibiotics is such an alternative to prolonged and/or repeated hospitalization for patients requiring intravenous antibiotics administration only. This alternative was started as a pilot study and soon became a usual service in the Centre hospitalier de lâUniversitÃ© Laval following receipt of a grant from the National Health Research and Development Program. After careful development of inclusion/exclusion criteria and a teaching manual for patient and {{health care providers}}. and the standardization of medical. pharmaceutical and nursing approach, a clinical, psychosocial and economical analysis of patients who agreed to participate in a clinical study comparing the two methods of health care delivery (hospital versus home) was started. Patients who met inclusion/exclusion criteria, agreeing to finish their treatment at home instead of staying hospitalized to receive intravenous antibiotics only, were taught the various techniques of intravenous self-injection. Once they were judged to be able to self-administer the antibiotics, they were sent home with the material needed to carry on their treatment, To date, more than 100 patients have participated in the home-treatment, of which 50 were analyzed. The duration of home treatment varied from two days to several months. Most patients had osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, <b>septic</b> <b>bursitis,</b> bacterial cellulitis or lung infections. The therapy allowed some newly defined patients with complicated infections (AIDS patients with cytomegalovirus retinitis) to continue their treatment at home. The clinical outcome of patients treated at home was identical to the outcomes of those treated in the hospital. Side effects were comparable with the hospital treatment and were mainly catheter-related. Compared with hospitalization. home treatment was preferred by the majority of patients. Psychological analysis of the patients showed that those who choose home therapy had a higher internal âlocus of controlâ than those who preferred to stay in the hospital for the entire length of therapy. The economical analysis showed a potential reduction of cost varying between $ 941. 00 and $ 3325. 00 per treatment. Home intravenous self-injection of antibiotics allowed health self-monitoring by the patients or/and their friends or family and increased health care efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} this study: Despite improvements in clinical outcome following treatment of synovial sepsis in horses, the prognosis for survival following septic navicular bursitis remains guarded, whilst the prognosis for athletic activity is considered poor. Surgical intervention is deemed essential for resolution. Two different surgical endoscopic {{approaches to the}} bursa have been described, however only {{the use of the}} direct approach has been reported in the management of clinical sepsis. The risk of inadvertent penetration of adjacent synovial structures with this approach is reported but has not been quantified. A transthecal approach, via the digital flexor tendon sheath, is considered to involve fewer complications than the direct approach but is typically reserved for elective examination of the aseptic bursa. The use of this approach in sepsis has not been evaluated. Intravenous regional limb perfusion with antimicrobials is an established adjunct in the management of synovial sepsis and is suggested to improve case outcome. The synovial concentrations of antimicrobial achieved following IVRP in caseâs of clinical sepsis have not been established. Objectives: To quantify the risk of inadvertent synovial structure penetration when making a direct surgical endoscopic approach to the navicular bursa. To determine a safer direct approach, with reduced risk of inadvertent synovial penetration. Â· To review the outcome of clinical caseâs of navicular bursa sepsis following surgical management via the transthecal endoscopic approach and post-operative management involving intravenous regional limb perfusion with amikacin. To compare these outcomes with those reported following management via the direct approach. Â· To investigate the concentrations of amikacin achieved in synovial fluid following IVRP in clinical caseâs of synovial sepsis. Hypotheses: Â· There is significant risk of inadvertently penetrating the distal interphalangeal joint and/or digital flexor tendon sheath when making a direct surgical endoscopic approach to the navicular bursa, with attendant potential for contamination of these structures when managing <b>septic</b> <b>bursitis.</b> Making the approach as abaxial as possible and advancing the instrument in a sagittal trajectory will minimise the risk of inadvertent synovial penetration. Â· The prognoses for survival and return to athletic function following surgical management of navicular bursa sepsis via the transthecal approach, in addition to post-operative intravenous regional perfusion with amikacin, are comparable with those reportedly managed via the direct approach. The surgical technique permits simplified postoperative intrasynovial medication and monitoring of synovial fluid parameters by establishing communication between the bursa and tendon sheath Â· Following regional intravenous limb perfusion, the levels of amikacin accumulated in contaminated synovial structures are greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration for commonly encountered bacteria, potentially validating the contribution of perfusion techniques as adjunct therapies in treating synovial sepsis. Methods: Â· Using 40 cadaver horse limbs, a conventional endoscopic approach, was made to the lateral aspect of the navicular bursa of each limb. Successful entry was confirmed endoscopically. Centesis and distension of the DFTS and DIPJ were performed to determine whether communication with the arthroscopic portal or bursa had occurred. Positive contrast radiographic navicular bursograms were performed to identify iatrogenic communication with the DFTS and/or DIPJ. A pilot study employing a modified approach was performed. Â· The case records of 10 horses presented with navicular bursa contamination, which underwent therapeutic surgical endoscopy of the navicular bursa via a transthecal approach and received post-operative intravenous regional perfusion with amikacin were evaluated retrospectively. Follow-up information was obtained by telephone questionnaire. Â· Intravenous regional limb perfusion with amikacin was performed on clinical caseâs of synovial sepsis and synovial fluid was aspirated from the contaminated synovial cavity 30 minutes later. Synovial fluid amikacin concentration was then measured. Results: Â· Using the direct surgical approach to the navicular bursa, inadvertent penetration of a synovial structure occurred in 45...|$|E
