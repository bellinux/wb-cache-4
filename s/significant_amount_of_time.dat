5|$|The term {{coronation}} {{is sometimes}} {{used in a}} semi-ironic sense to refer to uncontested party leadership elections, with all potential party leaders choosing to back a single candidate or to stay silent, rather than stand in an election {{they are likely to}} lose. This typically happens where there has been a protracted behind-the-scenes attempt to remove the outgoing leader, leading to a <b>significant</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to determine who has the most party support before the election proper.|$|E
5|$|Paul Baras of Brasier set {{the fastest}} lap {{of the race}} on his first lap. He {{held on to the}} lead until the third lap, when Szisz took over first position, {{defending}} it to the finish. Hot conditions melted the road tar, which the cars kicked up into the faces of the drivers, blinding them and making the racing treacherous. Punctures were common; tyre manufacturer Michelin introduced a detachable rim with a tyre already affixed, which could be quickly swapped onto a car after a puncture, saving a <b>significant</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> over manually replacing the tyre. This helped Nazzaro pass Clément on the second day, as the FIAT—unlike the Clément-Bayard—made use of the rims.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after losing}} Super Bowl XLI, Hester and special teams coach Dave Toub spent a <b>significant</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> working on new return {{strategies}} and formations. Ultimately, Lovie Smith converted Hester {{into a wide}} receiver {{in order to increase}} the number of opportunities he would receive during a game. Hester, who originally played as a wide receiver at the University of Miami, was initially hesitant about making the switch to offense, as he wished to follow in the footsteps of Deion Sanders. However, the Bears’ coaching staff eventually persuaded Hester to make the transition over the summer. During the 2007 off-season, Hester won the Best Breakthrough Athlete ESPY Award.|$|E
5|$|Welles's alleged {{biological}} son Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who {{was born}} out of wedlock to Welles and actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, first met Welles when he was 15 and later worked on the 1960 stage play Chimes at Midnight. This was the only <b>significant</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> that the two spent together and afterwards Lindsay-Hogg only saw Welles sporadically. Like Welles, Lindsay-Hogg had two surrogate fathers in addition to his biological father. In the late 1950s when she was 16, Welles's eldest daughter Christopher Welles Feder cut off all ties with Welles under pressure from her mother, who disapproved of Welles's influence on her. Welles and Feder later reconnected but their relationship never fully recovered. Welles's youngest daughter Beatrice, who resembled her father as a young boy, appears in the film version of Chimes at Midnight.|$|E
5|$|Race leader Hinault and his team, , {{allowed a}} {{breakaway}} to get almost a twenty-minute {{advantage over the}} peloton during the race's seventeenth stage, before other general classification contenders' teams stepped in {{to help with the}} chase. The attack group reached the finish line around ten minutes faster than the peloton. Swiss rider Daniel Gisiger won the stage ahead of Giovanni Mantovani. Paolo Rosola won his second stage of the event as the eighteenth stage resulted in a bunch sprint. The following day's race route was altered the night before by Torriani, which removed six kilometers off the climb of Great St Bernard Pass, while it still contained the full climb of the Cima Coppi, the Simplon Pass. The stage saw a large group of fifty-three riders cross the finish line together, with Moser at the head, taking his second stage victory of the event. Former race leader Visentini, after losing a <b>significant</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> during the stage 16 individual time trial, abandoned the race during the nineteenth stage.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, {{the short}} track relay team won Australia's first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze. They {{qualified}} for the four-team final after edging out Japan and New Zealand, finishing second in their semi-final. The quartet adopted a plan of staying on their feet as the first priority, and remaining undisqualified and defeating {{at least one of}} the other three finalists. During the race, the Canadians fell and lost a <b>significant</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> meaning that Australia would win a medal if they raced conservatively and avoided a crash. Late in the race, Nizielski was fighting with his American counterpart for track position to claim the silver medal, but took the safe option and yielded, mindful of the lost opportunity of the crash in Albertville. It was a successful campaign for the largest team that Australia had sent—apart from 1960. The 27 athletes recorded an unprecedented five top 10 finishes. Marshall placed first in the opening round of the aerials, but faded to sixth in the final, while Kerryn Rim placed eighth in the 15km biathlon and Steven Bradbury and Nizielski of the medal-winning relay team placed eighth and tenth in the 500m and 1,000m short track events respectively. In contrast to the previous games, the Australian short track speed skaters placed in the top half of the field in six of their eight individual starts. However, the Australians in the remaining disciplines generally finished in the bottom half of their competition.|$|E
5|$|Jovanović {{began working}} on the {{painting}} in 1900. In keeping with his usual approach, he spent a <b>significant</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> researching Dušan's life. He read medieval accounts of the proclamation, consulted experts on that historical period, and examined medieval paintings and illuminated manuscripts for insight into the architecture and weaponry of 14th-century Serbia. Jovanović also visited the monasteries of Gračanica and Lesnovo, the Field of Kosovo, and the cities of Prizren and Skopje. Since the church where the proclamation took place had long since been destroyed, {{he was forced to}} find an alternative, ultimately deciding to model it after the Visoki Dečani monastery given the similarities in their design. By his own admission, the hardest task Jovanović faced was achieving authenticity with regard to clothing, weaponry and medieval heraldry. He found the medieval clothing particularly difficult to reproduce because Serbs did not have their own national costume at the time. Instead, medieval Serbs, especially royalty and the nobility, wore clothing that was greatly influenced by neighbouring cultures, particularly the Byzantines. Jovanović styled the clothes seen in the painting on frescoes from the medieval monasteries he visited, sketched them, and then requested that the head costume designer of the Vienna State Opera recreate them based on those sketches. Upon receiving the costumes, Jovanović placed them in his studio and used them as models for the painting. Dušan's German mercenaries, who are shown lining the church doors church as he exits, wear Venetian body armour. Jovanović based this detail on a medieval correspondence that Novaković had discovered in the Venetian archives where Dušan is recorded having ordered 300 units of plate armour from Venice. Knights' swords and other weaponry were based on depictions from medieval frescoes. The heraldry depicted on the shields and the insignia of the various figures is based on examples from a medieval book titled Armaila Illyricorum. Jovanović had found the book in a Viennese library. It had been removed from Herzegovina's Žitomislić monastery several decades prior and brought to the Austro-Hungarian capital. The Proclamation of Dušan's Law Codex was painted outdoors, en plein air.|$|E
