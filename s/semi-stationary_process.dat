40|$|Spot option prices, {{forwards}} {{and options}} on forwards relevant for the commodity markets are computed when the underlying process S is modelled as an exponential {{of a process}} ξ with memory as e. g. a Lévy <b>semi-stationary</b> <b>process.</b> Moreover a risk premium h̊o̊ representing storage costs, illiquidity, convenience yield or insurance costs is explicitly modelled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type of dynamics with a mean level {{that depends on the}} same memory term as the commodity. Also the interest rate is assumed to be stochastic. To show the existence of an equivalent pricing measure Q for S we relate the stochastic differential equation for ξ to the generalised Langevin equation. When the interest rate is deterministic the process (ξ; h̊o̊) has an affine structure under the pricing measure Q and an explicit expression for the option price is derived in terms of the Fourier transform of the payoff function...|$|E
40|$|We {{present some}} new {{asymptotic}} results for functionals of higher order differences of Brownian semi-stationary processes. In an earlier work [4] we have derived a similar asymptotic theory for first order differences. However, the central limit theorems were valid only for certain {{values of the}} smoothness parameter of a Brownian semistationary process, and the parameter values which appear in typical applications, e. g. in modeling turbulent flows in physics, were excluded. The main goal of the current paper is the derivation of the asymptotic theory for {{the whole range of}} the smoothness parameter by means of using second order differences. We present the law of large numbers for the multipower variation of the second order differences of Brownian semi-stationary processes and show the associated central limit theorem. Finally, we demonstrate some estimation methods for the smoothness parameter of a Brownian <b>semi-stationary</b> <b>process</b> as an application of our probabilistic results.

40|$|Stable {{convergence}} {{is a type}} of {{convergence of}} random variables, which is stronger than weak convergence but weaker than convergence in probability. It has been used in asymptotic theory of statistics and probability since Renyi originated his work (cf. [91]) in 1963. In this thesis, we study applications of stable convergence in two aspects. First, we show how to estimate the asymptotic (conditional) covariance matrix, which appears in many central limit theorems for stable laws in high-frequency estimation. We employ the idea of subsampling to provide a positive semi-definite estimator for this matrix. We show that our estimator is consistent in both noiseless models and models with additive microstructure noise. This estimate together with stable convergence theorems allow us to make some statistical inferences such as constructing confidence intervals or doing hypothesis testing. Moreover, we provide a decomposition of the leading error terms, from which we are able to get some insights about how to configure the subsampler by optimally choosing its tuning parameters (e. g., the number of subsamples). This leads to a rate of convergence for the subsampler. Second, we apply stable convergence theorems to show a weak limit theorem for a numerical approximation of Brownian semi-stationary processes studied in [32]. In the original work of [32], the authors propose to use Fourier transformation to embed a given one dimensional Levy <b>semi-stationary</b> <b>process</b> into a two-parameter stochastic field. For the latter, they use a simple iteration procedure and study the strong approximation error (in L^ 2 sense) of the resulting numerical scheme given that the volatility process is fully observed. In this work, we give a more precise assessment of the numerical error associated with the Fourier method. We complement their study by analyzing the weak limit of the error process in the framework of Brownian semi-stationary processes, where the drift and the volatility processes need to be numerically simulated...|$|E
40|$|In [6], Serfozo {{introduced}} {{a class of}} stochastic processes which he called <b>semi-stationary</b> <b>processes,</b> and discussed elementary properties of these processes.

These processes are a generalization of strictly stationary processes. Hereafter stationary means strictly stationary. The object {{of this paper is}} to prove the functional central limit theorems for the <b>semi-stationary</b> <b>processes</b> with the strong mixing condition.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present some limit theorems for power {{variation}} of Lévy <b>semi-stationary</b> <b>processes</b> {{in the setting}} of infill asymptotics. Lévy <b>semi-stationary</b> <b>processes,</b> which are a one-dimensional analogue of ambit fields, are moving average type processes with a multiplicative random component, which is usually referred to as volatility or intermittency. From the mathematical point of view this work extends the asymptotic theory investigated in [14], where the authors derived the limit theory for kth order increments of stationary increments Lévy driven moving averages. The asymptotic results turn out to heavily depend on the interplay between the given order of the increments, the considered power p> 0, the Blumenthal [...] Getoor index β∈ (0, 2) of the driving pure jump Lévy process L and the behaviour of the kernel function g at 0 determined by the power α. In this paper we will study the first order asymptotic theory for Lévy <b>semi-stationary</b> <b>processes</b> with a random volatility/intermittency component and present some statistical applications of the probabilistic results...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} option of omitting the {{stationarity}} assumption, {{which is usually}} used in the financial time series analysis. The theory of <b>semi-stationary</b> <b>processes</b> is introduced. This type of process has time-dependent spectra (the evolutionary spectra) in comparison with stationary process. The evolutionary spectra estimator is derived using a linear filter and then averaged in time to reduce any fluctuations caused by randomness. Predictions and variance estimates are retrieved from the estimated time dependent spectra. The <b>semi-stationary</b> <b>processes</b> theory {{is applied to the}} ARMA processes with time-dependent coefficients, a coefficient estimator based on evolutionary spectra is suggested.

40|$|In this paper, three topics on semi-selfdecomposable {{distributions}} are studied. The {{first one}} is to characterize semi-selfdecomposable distributions by stochastic integrals with respect to Levy processes. This characterization defines a mapping from an infinitely divisible distribution with finite log-moment to a semi-selfdecomposable distribution. The second one is to introduce and study a Langevin type equation and the corresponding Ornstein-Uhlenbecktype process whose limiting distribution is semi-selfdecomposable. Also, <b>semi-stationary</b> Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type <b>processes</b> with semi-selfdecomposable distributions are constructed. The third one is to study the iteration of the mapping above. The iterated mapping is expressed as a single mapping with a different integrand. Also, nested subclasses {{of the class of}} semi-selfdecomposable distributions are considered, andit is shown that the limit of these nested subclasses is the closure of the class of semi-stable distributions...|$|R
