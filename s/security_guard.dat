500|$|In May 2009, {{members of}} Anonymous told WSMV-TV {{that they were}} bullied by off-duty <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> while protesting at a Scientology event in April in Nashville, Tennessee. According to WSMV-TV, a protester stated he was {{assaulted}} by three Scientology <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> while on public property, [...] away from the Scientology building. The Church of Scientology had previously informed the <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> that the protesters were [...] "dangerous people". A protester was issued three citations by the Scientology <b>security</b> <b>guards,</b> but these were all dismissed by the district attorney. On May 8, 2009, WSMV-TV reported that [...] "laws {{appear to have been}} broken" [...] {{in the manner in which}} the Scientology <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> handled the protesters. The Scientology <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> were not clearly identified as off-duty police officers, and permits for the Scientology event attended by the Anonymous protesters were for the wrong day. [...] "The armed people from the other county are not identified police officers. You're looking for a problem", said John M. L. Brown, a Fraternal Order of Police attorney.|$|R
5|$|Around {{midnight on}} Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona pulled {{up near the}} side {{entrance}} of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road.

Later at around 1a.m., <b>security</b> <b>guard</b> Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other <b>security</b> <b>guard.</b> The two guards were the only people in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.|$|E

40|$|What determines {{professional}} {{motivations and}} values of security operatives: sector or profession? Our article aims {{to answer this question}} through a survey study among police officers (n = 405) and private <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> (n = 329) in the Netherlands. Our results show that both groups closely resemble each other in how they prioritize motivations and values, although police officers have a slightly more “missionary” and “crime fighting” work ethic than private <b>security</b> <b>guards.</b> Mutual perceptions, however, reveal contrasts: Police officers look down on private <b>security</b> <b>guards,</b> while private <b>security</b> <b>guards</b> look up to police officers. We conclude with theoretical and practical implications of our findings...|$|R
