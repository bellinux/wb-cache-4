25|$|In the United States, General Motors ran {{in several}} cities a {{training}} program for firefighters and first responders to demonstrate the sequence of tasks required to safely disable the Chevrolet Voltâ€™s powertrain and its 12 volt electrical system, which controls its high-voltage components, and then proceed to extricate injured occupants. The Volt's high-voltage system is designed to shut down automatically {{in the event of}} an airbag deployment, and to detect a loss of communication from an airbag control module. GM also made available an Emergency Response Guide for the 2011 Volt for use by emergency responders.
