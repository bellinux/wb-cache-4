A very stable regime has been obtained with an ion-source made of two identical stages in cascade. The RF power supplies consist of two 2. 45 GHz magnetrons. The discharge chamber is made of two coaxial Pyrex tubes. The external one ensures vacuum and HT insulation. The tubes are aligned inside the two multimode cavities axially limited by three magnetic coils. The ion beam is extracted at 20 kV and focused with electric lenses. For argon and xenon, 1 mA <b>single-charged</b> <b>ion</b> currents have been extracted. The influence of various parameters has been progressively achieved with a set-up including a 60 ° analyzing magnet and with the 120 ° on-line isotope separator at SARA.

It is shown that after single-electron excitation into some {{level in the}} continuum (ATI) an inelastic collision of the excited electron with the parent atomic particle can result in an excitation of the ion. It may be the continuum state excitation giving the doubly charged ion or the discrete state which also greatly enhances the doubly charged ion production. The probability of these phenomena greatly exceeds that of the direct ionization of a <b>single-charged</b> <b>ion.</b> The single-electron ATI makes possible the two-electron process even in the moderate field.

Using tantalum foil as a target material, the on-line combined target-ion source unit efficiency, which {{is the product of}} the ionization and release efficiencies, has been obtained for neutron-deficient isotopes of Eu, Gd, and Yb. These nuclides were ionized by the surface ionization inside a hot tungsten target container, holding tantalum foils as a target material. The results of the combined target-ion source unit use for on-line laser resonant ionization spectroscopy investigation of neutron-deficient Gd isotopes have been also presented. For neutron-rich isotopes produced from a high-density UC target, which were ionized by the surface ionization inside the target container, the ionization efficiency values have been obtained close to 100 % for Rb and Cs and 10 % for In. For Ag and Sn neutron-richisotopes, the values of the electron-beam ionization efficiency in the volume of the targetcontainer, correspondingly equal to 4 % and 2 %, have been obtained...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The time {{of flight}} mass {{spectrometer}} of the Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) instrument aboard the Cassini spacecraft, {{is expected to be}} placed in orbit about Saturn to sample the ring material and satellite impact ejecta. Upon impact of an incident dust particle against the target plate at velocities of 5 - 100 km/s, some 10 - 8 to 10 - 5 times the particle mass of positive valence, <b>single-charged</b> <b>ions</b> is induced. These are analyzed via a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Initial experiments employing a pulsed N 2 laser (> 300 µJ/pulse, 4 ns, 337 nm) acting on a suite of samples are described. The laser beam is focussed to deliver the light pulses onto a laser power density (1011 W/cm 2) to simulate the impact of particles. Laser ionization produced a charge of 4. 6 pC per pulse for aluminum alloy. Estimating that each Al+ 1 ion require energy of 5. 98 eV ionization energy/ion implies that 10 - 5 % of the laser energy produced ions and the present system has a 5 % efficiency of collecting the laser-irradiation induced ions. Employing a multi-channel plate detector in this mass spectrometer yields for Al-Mg-Cu alloy and kamacite (Fe-Ni mineral) targets well defined peaks at 24 (Mg+ 1), 27 (Al+ 1) and 64 (Cu+ 1), and 56 (Fe+ 1), 58 (Ni+ 1) and 60 (Ni+ 1) dalton, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to explore the {{suitability}} of the complementary use of mass spectra and the corresponding statistical analysis (principal components-Pareto analysis (PCA) and discriminant analysis (DA)) of these spectra to differentiate diverse humic samples {{as a function of}} their structural and conformational features. To this end, the mass spectra of humic samples belonging to the main humic fraction types (gray humic acid, brown humic acid, and fulvic acid) were obtained by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The results obtained showed that the application of PCA yielded a clear separation between blanks and humic samples. However, a clear differentiation among the humic fraction types was not achieved. The DA of PCA data, however, yielded a clear separation among the humic substances (HS) samples belonging to each HS fraction type considered: gray humic acids, brown humic acids, and fulvic acids. These results showed that the mass spectra of each humic sample include characteristic mass/charge (m/z) distribution values that can be considered as a >fingerprint> representative of its specific structural features. Our results also indicate that, although the m/z values principally corresponded to <b>single-charged</b> <b>ions,</b> we cannot identify these molecular weight distributions with those of humic samples, since sample molecular fragmentation, as well as partial molecular ionization, cannot be ruled out under our experimental and instrumental conditions.

40|$|The Dubna {{radioactive}} beam factory (DRIBs) [1] {{will make}} use of two possibilities for producing secondary beams of radioactive nuclei. During {{the first phase of}} the project (Phase I) the possibility for obtaining radioactive nuclei in fragmentation reactions of stable nuclei, accelerated by the cyclotron U 400 M to intermediate energies (∼ 50 MeVA− 1), will be realized. The fragmentation products, obtained in a special ion source, will be converted into <b>single-charged</b> <b>ions,</b> which after transportation to the second cyclotron (U 400) will be accelerated up to energies of ∼ 20 – 25 MeVA− 1. This method will allow obtaining mainly beams of light radioactive nuclei with Z 30 with intensities up to 108 pps (e. g., nuclei such as 6 He). In the second phase of the project (Phase II) it is supposed to produce and accelerate radioactive neutron-rich nuclei in the mass region 80 A 140. This mass region corresponds to the fragments of low-energy fission of heavy nuclei. For this reason use will be made of the photofission of 238 U. The γ-quanta will be produced by the electron accelerator (the microtron MT- 25), where the electron beam with an intensity of about 20 µA has an energy of 25 MeV. With the help of a special converter the electron beam is transformed into a beam of γ-quanta with up to 25 MeV energy and a flux of 1014 s− 1. Thi...|$|R
40|$|The REXEBIS is an Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) {{developed}} {{especially to}} trap and further ionise the sometimes rare and short-lived isotopes that are {{produced in the}} ISOLDE separator for the Radioactive beam EXperiment at ISOLDE (REX-ISOLDE). By promoting the <b>single-charged</b> <b>ions</b> to a high charge-state the ions are more efficiently accelerated in the following linear accelerator. The EBIS uses an electron gun capable of producing a 0. 5 A electron beam. The electron gun is immersed in a magnetic field of 0. 2 T, and the electron beam is compressed to a current density of > 200 A/cm 2 inside a 2 T superconducting solenoid. The EBIS is situated on a high voltage (HV) platform with an initial electric potential of 60 kV allowing cooled and bunched 60 keV ions extracted from a Penning trap to be captured. After a period of confinement in the electron beam (< 20 ms), the <b>single-charged</b> <b>ions</b> have been ionised to a charge-to-mass ratio of approximately ¼. During this confinement period, the platform potential is decreased to about 20 kV, and an axial potential barrier is lowered to allow the now highly charged ions to be extracted from the EBIS at an energy matching the requirement of the Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ). Several different topics are presented in this report, all connected with the design and construction of an EBIS. Old 'truths' have also been scrutinised, for instance alignment tolerances. A large part {{is devoted to the}} description of a novel EBIS simulation implementation. A complete injection, breeding and extraction cycle has been simulated to certify high injection and extraction efficiencies. The entire EBIS was modelled in an ion-tracing program called SIMION, and the accepted and emitted phase spaces were determined. Beam optics parameters such as lens positions, voltages, accepted beam-tilt and displacement tolerances at the focal points were also settled using SIMION. An analytically derived acceptance formula was verified with simulations, and general conclusions on acceptance, emittance and energy spread of an EBIS are presented in this report. Any possible correlation between the two transverse phase spaces was shown to be insignificant. Furthermore, continuous injection, and maximal obtainable efficiency for such an injection mode were studied theoretically. The electron reflection and back-scattering in the collector was simulated using a combination of EGUN and SIMION. The result showed that a much lower degree of electron back-scattering may be obtained with this design as compared to previously published estimations. Furthermore, the Penning trapping of electrons at the trap barrier (or the post anode) was addressed, and techniques to avoid it were evaluated. Vacuum considerations for residual gas in the warm-bore magnet chamber, and the back-flow of Ar cooling gas from the Penning trap, have also been addressed since there is a risk of outnumbering the small number of radioactive ions. Simulated extraction spectra for different pressure scenarios are presented. All different REXEBIS elements (magnet, electron gun, inner structure, collector etc) are described from a design and performance perspective, and preliminary investigations of the platform high voltage switching and the beam diagnostics are included as well. A very elegant and simple method to align the solenoid within the iron yoke was developed and used. The high experimental emittance value obtained for electron beam ion source at MSL in Stockholm (4 times larger than the absolute upper theoretical value) was reproduced in simulations and could be justified by aberrations in the small einzel lens following the collector. The result of this simulation also verified the validity of the developed EBIS code...|$|R

40|$|The {{time-of-flight}} (TOF) {{mass spectrometer}} (MS) of the Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) instrument aboard the Cassini spacecraft {{is expected to}} be placed in orbit about Saturn to sample submicrometer-diameter ring particles and impact ejecta from Saturn's satellites. The CDA measures a mass spectrum of each particle that impacts the chemical analyzer sector of the instrument. Particles impact a Rh target plate at velocities of 1 - 100 km/s and produce some 10 ^(− 8) to 10 ^(− 5) times the particle mass of positive valence, <b>single-charged</b> <b>ions.</b> These are analyzed via a TOF MS. Initial tests employed a pulsed N 2 laser acting on samples of kamacite, pyrrhotite, serpentine, olivine, and Murchison meteorite induced bursts of ions which were detected with a microchannel plate and a charge sensitive amplifier (CSA). Pulses from the N_ 2 laser (10 ^(11) W/cm^ 2) are assumed to simulate particle impact. Using aluminum alloy as a test sample, each pulse produces a charge of ∼ 4. 6 pC (mostly Al^(+ 1)), whereas irradiation of a stainless steel target produces a ∼ 2. 8 pC (Fe^(+ 1)) charge. Thus the present system yields ∼ 10 ^(− 5) % of the laser energy in resulting ions. A CSA signal indicates that at the position of the microchannel plate, the ion detector geometry is such that some 5 % of the laser-induced ions are collected in the CDA geometry. Employing a multichannel plate detector in this MS yields for Al-Mg-Cu alloy and kamacite targets well-defined peaks at 24 (Mg^(+ 1)), 27 (Al^(+ 1)), and 64 (Cu^(+ 1)) and 56 (Fe^(+ 1)), 58 (Ni^(+ 1)), and 60 (Ni^(+ 1)) dalton, respectively...|$|R

In this study, we analyzed the cleavage site and other amino acid modifications that occur on the core protein. To produce the posttranslationally modified core protein, we used a baculovirus-insect cell expression model system. As previously reported, p 23 is processed to form p 21 in insect {{as well as in}} mammalian cells. p 21 was found {{to be associated with the}} cytoplasmic membrane, and its significant portion behaved as an integral membrane protein. The protein was purified from the membrane by a simple and unique procedure on the basis of its membrane-binding properties and solubility in detergents. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis of purified p 21 showed that the average molecular mass (m/z 19, 307) of its <b>single-charged</b> <b>ion</b> differs by m/z 1, 457 from that calculated for p 23. To determine the posttranslational modifications, tryptic p 21 peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. We found three peptides that did not match the theoretically derived peptides of p 23. Analysis of these peptides by MALDI-TOF tandem MS revealed that they correspond to N-terminal peptides (residues 2 to 9 and 2 to 10) starting with α-N-acetylserine and C-terminal peptide (residues 150 to 177) ending with phenylalanine.

40|$|Studies {{in regions}} of the nuclear chart in which the model {{predictions}} of properties of nuclei fail can bring {{a better understanding of}} the strong interaction in the nuclear medium. To such regions belongs the so called "island of inversion" centered around Ne, Na and Mg isotopes with 20 neutrons in which unexpected ground-state spins, large deformations and dense low-energy spectra appear. This is a strong argument that the magic N= 20 is not a closed shell in this area. In this thesis investigations of isotope shifts of stable ^ 24 - 26 Mg, as well as spins and magnetic moments of short-lived ^ 29, 31 Mg are presented. The successful studies were performed at the ISOLDE facility at CERN using collinear laser and β-NMR spectroscopy techniques. The isotopes were investigated as <b>single-charged</b> <b>ions</b> in the 280 nm transition from the atomic ground state ^ 2 S_ 1 / 2 to one of the two lowest excited states ^ 2 P_ 1 / 2, 3 / 2 using continuous wave laser beams. The isotope-shift measurements with fluorescence detection for the three stable isotopes show that it is feasible to perform the same studies on radioactive Mg isotopes up to the "island of inversion". This will allow to determine differences in the mean charge square radii δ〈 r^ 2 〉 and interpret them in terms of deformation. The high detection efficiency for β- particles and optical pumping close to saturation allowed to obtain very good β-asymmetry signals for ^ 29 Mg and ^ 31 Mg with half-lives around 1 s and production yields about 10 ^ 5 ions/s. For this purpose the ions were implanted into a host crystal lattice. Such detection of the atomic resonances revealed their hyperfine structure, which gives the sign and a first estimate of the value of the magnetic moment. The nuclear magnetic resonance gave also their g-factors with the relative uncertainty smaller than 0. 2...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the goals}} in studies of double {{ionization}} (DI) of simple atoms by electron or ion impact is to elucidate and assess the different mechanisms that lead to this atomic process. In this work we present an attempt to model the mechanisms beyond the first order in DI of helium by highly charged projectiles. To this end we employ the continuum distorted wave-eikonal initial state (CDW-EIS) formalism joint with a Monte Carlo event generator (MCEG). The MCEG allows us to generate theoretical event files that represent the counterpart of the data obtained from a kinematically complete experiment. Starting from these event files, a new data analysis tool used to contrast theory and experiment in DI, the four-body Dalitz plots, is easily produced. The higher order mechanisms are simulated by considering DI as a sequential process: a single ionization of a helium atom {{as a first step}} and another single ionization of a <b>single-charged</b> helium <b>ion</b> as a second step.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{energetic}} oxygen <b>ions</b> (i. e. <b>single-charged</b> atomic oxygen <b>ions,</b> O+) at altitudes higher than 5 Earth radii (RE) and at latitudes above 75 (toward 90) degrees invariant latitude (deg ILAT) in the dayside polar magnetosphere observed by Cluster. The instrument {{used in this}} study is CIS (Cluster Ion Spectrometry experiment) / CODIF (a time-of-flight ion COmposition and DIstribution Function analyser), which covers an energy range from » 10 eV up to 38 keV. Cluster detected O+ with energies more than 1 keV (hereafter termed “keV O+”), indicating that energization and/or acceleration process(es) take place in the dayside high-altitude (inside magnetopause) and high-latitude region. These O+ are outflowing (precisely, upward-going along the geomagnetic field lines), and these outflowing keV O+ show a heated (or energized) signature in the velocity distribution as well. First, outflowing O+ are observed at the poleward cusp and/or the mantle formed a partial shell-like configuration seen in the velocity distribution. Second, the latitudinal distribution of outflowing O+ (most of them have energies less than 1 keV statistically) observed below 7 RE is consistent with velocity filter effect by the polar convection, while the latitudinal distribution of outflowing keV O+ observed above 7 RE cannot be explained by velocity filter effect only, i. e. this indicates that additional energization and/or acceleration takes place at higher altitudes in the dayside polar region. Thirdly, a tendency to observe outflowing keV O+ for during different geomagnetic conditions is studied. The keV O+ above 9 RE is more often for K p¸ 5 rather than for K p• 3. However the energy of O+ is not dependent on ASY /SYM indices. Finally, the dependence on the solar wind conditions is also studied. The energization and/or acceleration of outflowing O+ is controlled by both solar wind moments (except solar wind electric field) and strong southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) at the time scale of tens of minutes at only higher altitudes. Further examination shows that solar wind dependence is different at three regions: one is the poleward cusp, another is the low-altitude polar cap, and finally the high-altitude polar cap, combining all the results. There is (a) new energization and/or acceleration process(es) at the high-altitude polar cap. On the other hand, flux enhancement of O+ observed above 5 RE is also controlled by solar wind moments (e. g. solar wind electric field) and strong southward IMF, however the ionospheric changes play a more important role on the flux enhancement of O+...|$|R
