A key driver for those reviews was {{the establishment of the}} Copyright Law Review Committee (CLRC) in 1983 as an advisory body for copyright reform. The CLRC was disbanded in 2005 by the Australian government after it had produced a number of reports. Notable reports include: The meaning of Publication in the Copyright Act (1984), Use of Copyright materials by Churches (1985), Performers' Protection (1987), Moral Rights (1988), Report of Journalists' Copyright (1994), Computer <b>Software</b> <b>Protection</b> (1994), Simplification of the Copyright Act: Part 1 (1998), Simplification of the Copyright Act: Part 2 (1999), Jurisdiction and Procedures of the Copyright Tribunal (2002), Copyright and Contract (2002) and Crown Copyright (2005). The CLRC also published reports on specific areas of copyright, including Highways to Change: Copyright in the New Communications Environment: report by the Copyright Convergence Group on technological advancement and the ability of legislation to cope with change (1994), Stopping the Rip-Offs: intellectual Property Protection for Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Peoples (1994), the Simpson Report 1995, long title Review of Australian Copyright Collecting Societies, the Bently and Sherman Report 1995, long title Performers' Rights: Options for Reform, the Janke Report 1999, long title Our Culture, Our Future, and the Ergas Report 2000, long title Report on Intellectual Property legislation under Competition Principles Agreement.|$|E

40|$|Obfuscation {{techniques}} are a general category of <b>software</b> <b>protections</b> widely adopted to prevent malicious tampering {{of the code}} by making applications more difficult to understand and thus harder to modify. Obfuscation {{techniques are}} divided in code and data obfuscation, depending on the protected asset. While preliminary empirical {{studies have been conducted}} to determine the impact of code obfuscation, our work aims at assessing the effectiveness and efficiency in preventing attacks of a specific data obfuscation technique - VarMerge. We conducted an experiment with student participants performing two attack tasks on clear and obfuscated versions of two applications written in C. The experiment showed a significant effect of data obfuscation on both the time required to complete and the successful attack efficiency. An application with VarMerge reduces by six times the number of successful attacks per unit of time.

40|$|Abstract — As various {{computers}} are connected {{into a world}} wide network, <b>software</b> <b>protections</b> becomes a more and more important issue for software users and developers. There are some technical measures for <b>software</b> <b>protections,</b> such as hardwarebased protections and software-based techniques, etc. Software obfuscation {{is one of these}} measures. It protects software from unauthorized modification by making software more obscure so that it is hard for the potential attacker to understand the obfuscated software. Chow et al. use residue number technique to software obfuscation by encoding variables in the original program to hide the true meaning of these variables [1]. There is some discussion about the division of residue numbers in [1], but, in order to lay a sound ground for this technique, we proposed homomorphic functions in [2] to deal with division by several constants in residue numbers. Data structures are important components of programme and they are key clues for people to understand codes. Obfuscating data structures of programme will make it very hard for an enemy to attack them. In this paper, we apply homomorphic functions to obfuscating the data structures of software. Index Terms — software obfuscation, residue number coding, homomorphic obfuscation. I...|$|R

40|$|Computer and {{communication}} industries develop {{so rapidly that}} the demand for software becomes larger and larger {{and the demand for}} <b>software</b> <b>protections,</b> such as copyright and anti-tampering defense, are more and more important to software users and developers. There are some technical measures for <b>software</b> <b>protections,</b> such as hardware-based protections, network filters, cryptosystems, etc. Software obfuscation is one of these measures. It protects software from unauthorized modification by making software more obscure so that it is hard for the potential attacker to understand the obfuscated software. In software obfuscation, we can obfuscate the control flow and the data flow of the software. In this paper, we explore an obfuscation based on residue number coding, which is a method widely used in hardware design, high precision integer arithmetic, and cryptography [1]. Recently, it has used as an obfuscation that encoded variables in the original program to hide the true meaning of these variables [2]. There is some discussion about the division of residue numbers in [2], but the technique proposed there is incorrect. In this paper, we establish a provable residue number encoding for software obfuscation, especially a provable algorithm for division by several constants in residue numbers.
