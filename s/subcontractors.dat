F-22 production was split up over many <b>subcontractors</b> across 46 states to increase Congressional support, though this production split may have contributed to increased costs and delays. Many capabilities were deferred to post-service upgrades, reducing the initial cost but increasing total program cost. Production supported over 1,000 <b>subcontractors</b> and suppliers and up to 95,000 jobs.|$|E

40|$|An {{industry}} report in Hong Kong {{calls for an}} agreed framework for appraising <b>subcontractor</b> performance. A set of performance appraisal criteria is developed that is agreeable to all key stakeholders in subcontracting. By examining the criteria being applied {{around the world and}} reviewing the available literature, a set of 31 <b>subcontractor</b> performance appraisal criteria was compiled. A questionnaire survey was conducted in Hong Kong to reveal the perception of relevant stakeholders on the most critical criteria for <b>subcontractor</b> appraisal. The independent samples t-test confirmed that the main contractor and <b>subcontractor</b> groups had a significant agreement on the importance levels of most <b>subcontractor</b> performance appraisal criteria. Through factor analysis, the 15 most important <b>subcontractor</b> performance appraisal criteria and their underlying relationships are identified. The results indicate that the three overarching factors for <b>subcontractor</b> performance appraisal are 'team interaction', 'accomplishment of project goals' and 'track record'. The identified appraisal criteria lay a solid foundation {{for the development of a}} centralized <b>subcontractor</b> performance appraisal system to facilitate performance reporting, data sharing and benchmarking. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{subcontracting}} price schemes between a <b>subcontractor</b> and {{a firm that}} are engaged in subcontracting of heterogeneous orders with distinct due dates, revenues, and processing times. We assume that the <b>subcontractor</b> proposes the subcontracting pricing and the firm follows by determining the subcontracted orders by solving its order acceptance and scheduling problem. When the <b>subcontractor</b> adopts a linear pricing scheme, we find the firm's optimal decisions and develop an algorithm to derive the <b>subcontractor's</b> own optimal pricing. We then design a fixed pricing with transfer payment scheme and a quantity discount pricing scheme to coordinate the firm's and <b>subcontractor's</b> decisions. We examine if the <b>subcontractor</b> can make a higher profit using either of these schemes than the linear pricing scheme, and if they will induce the firm to make decisions that lead to system-wide optimal outcomes.

40|$|Consider the {{following}} contractual hierarchy: a principal who contracts with a contractor below her who then contracts with a <b>subcontractor.</b> The principal requires goods made from both firms in equal proportions. The question we study is whether, at zero cost, the principal {{would wish to}} monitor the contract between the <b>subcontractor</b> and contractor. Without monitoring the contractor will determine the type of the <b>subcontractor.</b> Hence, when contracting with the principal he can extract an information rent on this knowledge. Monitoring would reveal the <b>subcontractor</b> type and so lower the principal's bill. However, if the principal monitors the contract between contractor and <b>subcontractor</b> then he may prefer to not screen the <b>subcontractor.</b> So, the contractor must be offered an incentive to screen below. The paper shows that the second of these costs is smaller {{for a range of}} parameter values, so that monitoring and incentivizing screening is cheaper than not monitoring.

5|$|The Army {{presence}} at Oak Ridge increased in August 1943 when Nichols replaced Marshall {{as head of}} the Manhattan Engineer District. One of his first tasks was to move the district headquarters to Oak Ridge, although the name of the district did not change. In September 1943 the administration of community facilities was outsourced to Turner Construction Company through a subsidiary, the Roane-Anderson Company. The company was paid a fee of $25,000 per month on a cost-plus contract, about 1 percent of the $2.8 million monthly cost of running the town facilities. Roane-Anderson did not take over everything at once, and a phased takeover started with Laundry No. 1 on 17 October 1943; transportation and garbage collection soon followed. It assumed responsibility for water and sewage in November, and electricity in January 1944. The number of Roane-Anderson workers peaked at around 10,500 in February 1945, including concessionaires and <b>subcontractors.</b> Thereafter, numbers declined to 2,905 direct employees and 3,663 concessionaires and <b>subcontractors</b> when the Manhattan Project ended on 31 December 1946.|$|E

5|$|Because of delays from Stadler's <b>subcontractors,</b> five {{instead of}} eight trams were {{available}} when the line opened on 22 June 2010.

On 7 June, two trams collided at low speed at Byparken, causing a derailment and forced the two trams to be repaired. This caused the summer schedule to {{be reduced to a}} 30-minute headway.
