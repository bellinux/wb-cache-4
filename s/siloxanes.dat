25|$|Biogas grid-{{injection}} is {{the injection}} of biogas into {{the natural gas}} grid. The raw biogas has to be previously upgraded to biomethane. This upgrading implies the removal of contaminants such as hydrogen sulphide or <b>siloxanes,</b> {{as well as the}} carbon dioxide. Several technologies are available for this purpose, being the most widely implemented the pressure swing adsorption (PSA), water or amine scrubbing (absorption processes) and, in the last years, membrane separation.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the 1920s, {{the work}} of William Lawrence Bragg on X-ray {{crystallography}} successfully elucidated the compositions of the silicates, which had previously been known from analytical chemistry but {{had not yet been}} understood, together with Linus Pauling's development of crystal chemistry and Victor Goldschmidt's development of geochemistry. The middle of the 20th century saw the development of the chemistry and industrial use of <b>siloxanes</b> and the growing use of silicone polymers, elastomers, and resins. In the late 20th century, the complexity of the crystal chemistry of silicides was mapped, along with the solid-state chemistry of doped semiconductors.|$|E
25|$|Methanogenic archaea are {{responsible}} for all biological sources of methane. Some live in symbiotic relationships with other life forms, including termites, ruminants, and cultivated crops. Other sources of methane, the principal component of natural gas, include landfill gas, biogas, and methane hydrate. When methane-rich gases are produced by the anaerobic decay of non-fossil organic matter (biomass), these {{are referred to as}} biogas (or natural biogas). Sources of biogas include swamps, marshes, and landfills, as well as agricultural waste materials such as sewage sludge and manure by way of anaerobic digesters, in addition to enteric fermentation, particularly in cattle. Landfill gas is created by decomposition of waste in landfill sites. Excluding water vapor, about half of landfill gas is methane and most of the rest is carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, and variable trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide and <b>siloxanes.</b> If the gas is not removed, the pressure may get so high that it works its way to the surface, causing damage to the landfill structure, unpleasant odor, vegetation die-off, and an explosion hazard. The gas can be vented to the atmosphere, flared or burned to produce electricity or heat. Biogas can also be produced by separating organic materials from waste that otherwise goes to landfills. This method is more efficient than just capturing the landfill gas it produces. Anaerobic lagoons produce biogas from manure, while biogas reactors can be used for manure or plant parts. Like landfill gas, biogas is mostly methane and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. However, with the exception of pesticides, there are usually lower levels of contaminants.|$|E

40|$|Bisphenol-A polycarbonate/eugenol-siloxane {{copolymers}} were fractionated at the preparative scale by {{the continuous}} polymer fractionation (CPF) technique. It {{is the first}} example of copolymer fractionation by CPF. The distribution of <b>siloxane</b> species across the fractions was assessed for copolymers differing in initial <b>siloxane</b> concentration and block length. On- and off-line combinations of size exclusion chromatography and infrared spectroscopy were used to analyze chemical composition (CC) of the unfractionated samples across the molecular weight distribution enabling comparison with the fractions. A polycarbonate-siloxane copolymer containing 10 wt% of very short <b>siloxane</b> blocks (dp = 2) was fractionated solely according to molecular weight (MW). By contrast, a copolymer containing 5 wt% <b>siloxane</b> blocks with a larger degree of polymerization (dp = 23) was fractionated according to MW, {{as well as to}} CC. This 'chemical drift' effect for the larger <b>siloxane</b> block length can be ascribed to large solubility differences of low MW chains, which drastically vary in composition according to the (small) number of <b>siloxane</b> blocks they contain.

40|$|A thermo-alkaline {{treatment}} with air stripping was applied before anaerobic sludge digestion for both <b>siloxane</b> removal and sludge disintegration. The treatment {{was expected to}} increase the amount of biogas produced and to reduce the amount of <b>siloxane</b> in the gas. Adding sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to the sludge improved the removal of <b>siloxane</b> from the sludge, with approximately 90 % of the <b>siloxane</b> removed to the gas phase using a thermo-alkaline treatment. Over 80 % of decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D 5) could be removed under the following conditions: 55 Â°C treatment temperature, 135 g-NaOH kg 1 volatile total solids (VTS), and 0. 5 L min 1 air-stripping rate. The disintegration ratio of volatile suspended solids (VSS) in the sludge was correlated with the D 5 removal ratio.
