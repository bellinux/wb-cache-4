25|$|Spatial {{resolution}} of an fMRI study refers {{to how well}} it discriminates between nearby locations. It {{is measured by the}} size of voxels, as in MRI. A voxel is a three-dimensional rectangular cuboid, whose dimensions are set by the slice thickness, the area of a slice, and the grid imposed on the slice by the scanning process. Full-brain studies use larger voxels, while those that focus on <b>specific</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> typically use smaller sizes. Sizes range from 4 to 5mm to 1mm. Smaller voxels contain fewer neurons on average, incorporate less blood flow, and hence have less signal than larger voxels. Smaller voxels imply longer scanning times, since scanning time directly rises with the number of voxels per slice and the number of slices. This can lead both to discomfort for the subject inside the scanner and to loss of the magnetization signal. A voxel typically contains a few million neurons and tens of billions of synapses, with the actual number depending on voxel size and the area of the brain being imaged.|$|E

30|$|The {{error is}} defined as the pixel {{difference}} between the two images after non-rigid registration. The pair of registration images with the smallest difference is considered for the final calculation of the local deformations and non-rigid strains. This step ensures the selection of the best non-rigid registration method for each <b>specific</b> <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> studied in the volume.

30|$|A {{fixation}} {{refers to}} the period a person maintains his or her visual gaze on a single location, which {{is a sign of}} a person’s attention focus. Such a location or area is also called a fixation point, and thus the number of fixations is defined as the total number of fixation points on an area <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> (Swanston and Walley 1984).

However, it is from experimental studies that direct quantification of cerebral microcirculation becomes feasible. Another important limitation relates to the limited length of the time during which the animals were monitored and studied. Hence, although longer monitoring time could have demonstrated a wider range of patho-physiological processes affecting microcirculation, the focus {{of this study was to}} capture the early changes in RMBF at <b>specific</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> superimposed to the early histopathology changes derived from axonal injury after trauma.|$|E

For reducing the complexity and increasing efficiency, the data samples for location sensing is limited in a term of taking sparsity of the detected signal in known transformed domain by taking fewer data samples.
