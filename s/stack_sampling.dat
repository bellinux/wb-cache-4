Previous instrumentation-based approaches for reporting calling context introduce overhead proportional to the number of function calls performed. We describe a new design for a call path profiler based on <b>stack</b> <b>sampling.</b> Our design enables profiling of unmodified binaries, provides low and controllable overhead, and accurately attributes context-dependent costs of calls. We use a special trampoline function that improves the efficiency of <b>stack</b> <b>sampling</b> and enables the association of unique invocation counts with sampled call sites. We evaluate a Tru 64 /Alpha implementation of our design and show that on call-intensive codes, the overhead of our approach is over two orders of magnitude lower than the overhead of an instrumentation-based approach, with comparable overhead on other codes...|$|E

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{progress made}} on the subject project {{during the period of}} September 1, 2004 through February 28, 2005. The TERESA Study is designed to investigate the role played by specific emissions sources and components in the induction of adverse health effects by examining the relative toxicity of coal combustion and mobile source (gasoline and/or diesel engine) emissions and their oxidative products. The study involves on-site sampling, dilution, and aging of coal combustion emissions at three coal-fired power plants, as well as mobile source emissions, followed by animal exposures incorporating a number of toxicological endpoints. The DOE-EPRI Cooperative Agreement (henceforth referred to as ''the Agreement'') for which this technical progress report has been prepared covers the performance and analysis of field experiments at the first TERESA plant, located in the Upper Midwest and henceforth referred to as Plant 0, and at two additional coal-fired power plants (Plants 1 and 2) utilizing different coal types and with different plant configurations. During this reporting period, all fieldwork at Plant 0 was completed. <b>Stack</b> <b>sampling</b> was conducted in October to determine if there were significant differences between the in-stack PM concentrations and the diluted concentrations used for the animal exposures. Results indicated no significant differences and therefore confidence that the revised <b>stack</b> <b>sampling</b> methodology described in the previous semiannual report is appropriate for use in the Project. Animal exposures to three atmospheric scenarios were carried out. From October 4 - 7, we conducted exposures to oxidized emissions with the addition of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Later in October, exposures to the most complex scenario (oxidized, neutralized emissions plus SOA) were repeated to ensure comparability with the results of the June/July exposures where a different <b>stack</b> <b>sampling</b> setup was employed. In November, exposures to oxidized emissions were performed. Stage I toxicological assessments were carried out in Sprague-Dawley rats. Biological endpoints included breathing pattern/pulmonary function; in vivo chemiluminescence (an indicator of oxidative stress); blood cytology; bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analysis; and histopathology. No significant differences between exposed animals and sham animals (exposed to filtered air) were observed for any of the endpoints; histopathological results are pending and will be reported in the next semiannual report. The scenarios evaluated during this reporting period were slightly modified from those originally proposed. We substituted a new scenario, secondary aerosol + SOA, to investigate the effects of a strongly acidic aerosol with a biogenic component. Since we did not observe any biological response to this scenario, the neutralized secondary aerosol scenario (i. e., oxidized emissions + ammonia) was deemed unnecessary. Moreover, in light of the lack of response observed in the Stage I assessment, it was decided that a Stage II assessment (evaluation of cardiac function in a compromised rat model) was unlikely to provide useful information. However, this model will be employed at Plant 1 and/or 2. During this reporting period, significant progress was made in planning for fieldwork at Plant 1. <b>Stack</b> <b>sampling</b> was carried out at the plant in mid-December to determine the concentration of primary particles. It was found that PM{sub 2. 5 } mass concentrations were approximately three times higher than those observed at Plant 0. In mid-February, installation and setup for the mobile laboratories began. Animal exposures are scheduled to begin at this plant on March 21, 2005. During the next reporting period, we will initiate fieldwork at Plant 1.

This {{can be attributed to}} the fact that published information on the topic is rare if not absent. In the present study, general statistical measures of field blanks used in odour measurement research, are reported. The objective of the study was to provide insight in the distribution of field blank values. During 2013 and 2014, field blanks were analysed as part of regular investigations into odour emissions. Point sources were most frequently observed (87 %), as well as the use of diluting stack samplers (72 %). It was found that average odour concentration and standard deviation of the dataset were 1. 39 and 0. 379 log(ouE/m 3) respectively, both expressed on a logarithmic scale (base 10). Median values of odour concentration of field blanks taken with <b>stack</b> <b>sampler</b> methods, differed significantly from lung sample methods, being a factor two higher.

We search for a cumulative gamma-ray emission in direction of galaxy clusters by analysing a collection of stacked Fermi-LAT count maps. Additionally, we investigate possible systematic differences in the emission between cool-core and non-cool core cluster populations. Making use of a sample of 53 clusters selected from the HIFLUGCS catalog, we do not detect a significant signal from the <b>stacked</b> <b>sample.</b> The upper limit on the average flux per cluster derived for the total <b>stacked</b> <b>sample</b> is {{at the level of}} a few 1 e- 11 ph cm- 2 s- 1 at 95 % confidence level in the 1 - 300 GeV band, assuming power-law spectra with photon indices 2. 0, 2. 4, 2. 8 and 3. 2. Separate stacking of the cool core and non-cool core clusters in the sample lead to similar values of around 5 e- 11 ph cm- 2 s- 1 and 2 e- 11 ph cm- 2 s- 1, respectively. Under the assumption that decaying pi 0, produced in collisions between CRs and the ambient thermal gas, are responsible for the gamma-ray emission, we set upper limits on the average CR content in galaxy clusters. For the entire cluster population, our upper limit on the gamma-ray flux translates into an upper limit on the average CR-to-thermal energy ratio of 4. 6 % for a photon index of 2. 4, although it is possible for individual systems to exceed this limit. Our 95 % upper limits are at the level expected from numerical simulations, which likely suggests that the injection of CR at cosmological shocks is less efficient than previously assumed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} consolidation performed robotically of stacked epoxy pre-impregnated carbon ber. Consolidation is when the composite is compacted by applying pressure. This removes voids in the composite which increases mechanical properties. The process of consolidation is generally assumed to be viscoelastic. Two tests were made to investigate the viscoelastic properties of the uncured composite material: One relaxation test to investigate how temperature, stacking sequence, strain level and sample size a ects timedependent viscoelastic properties. The second experiment was to study the level of compaction achieved from local consolidation of the composite material, the latter obtained when using an industrial robot. The relaxation test showed that the compression response was decreased with higher temperatures and increased with higher strain levels. Samples with a reduced area showed larger relaxation e ects than unreduced <b>samples.</b> Unidirectionally <b>stacked</b> <b>samples</b> had larger relaxation e ects than <b>samples</b> <b>stacked</b> cross-directionally.
