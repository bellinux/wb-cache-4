5|$|The {{key idea}} is that under certain {{circumstances}} where a representation has been made by a public authority to an individual who {{would be affected by}} a decision by the authority, the individual expects to be heard before the decision is made. To deny the right to be heard amounts to unfairness. The court will thus be inclined to quash a decision if there has been unfairness and reliance by the individual on the representation to his detriment. This is demonstrated in the 1983 House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case). This case involved the trade unions of employees of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a government signals and intelligence department, who argued that they had an expectation to be consulted before the Minister took the decision to deny them the right to join trade unions. The Minister argued that it had been necessary to take that step as the trade unions were conducting strikes that crippled GCHQ operations and threatened the national <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom. The Court established that in the past the trade unions had been consulted on employment-related matters, even though it was not a rule. However, their Lordships clearly recognized that an individual can have a legitimate expectation to be consulted before a decision is taken when it is proven that this is the practice. Such a representation can {{come in the form of}} a clear and unambiguous promise to hear the individual or an established practice to consult those affected before taking the decision. Nonetheless, on the facts of the case, their Lordships agreed that they could not review the Minister's decision even though there was an enforceable legitimate expectation as the decision had been made on national security grounds.|$|E
25|$|The state secrets {{privilege}} {{serves a}} vital function {{by ensuring that}} private litigants cannot use litigation to force the disclosure of information that, if made public, would directly harm the national <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.

25|$|Regardless of the {{inability}} to declare war, the President does {{have the power to}} unilaterally order military action in defense of the United States when he determines that a foreign political entity poses a clear and present danger to the safety and <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. By U.S. law, the only limitation on that power is a requirement to notify specific members of Congress within 48 hours after the beginning of military operations. Once proper legal notification is given to the required members of Congress, military action can continue and remain secret so long as the President judges it necessary to national security.|$|E
25|$|By 1956 the {{pipeline}} was extended via Sarnia, Ontario to Toronto and became, at 3,100km, the longest oil pipeline in the world. In {{the interest of}} increasing oil exports, extensions were built to Chicago and other refinery locations in the Midwestern United States during the 1960s. In the other direction, in 1950 the federal government gave approval to build a pipeline west, and in 1953 the 1,200km Transmountain Pipeline was built from Edmonton to the port of Vancouver, British Columbia with an extension to Seattle, Washington. These pipelines did more to improve the energy <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States than that of Canada, since the Canadian government {{was more interested in}} the country's trade balance than in military or energy security.|$|E

After the 2016 U.S. presidential election, worries grew that Russian propaganda spread and organized by the Russian government swayed {{the outcome of the}} election, and representatives in the U.S. Congress took action to safeguard the National <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States by advancing legislation to monitor incoming propaganda from external threats. On November 30, 2016, legislators approved a measure within the National Defense Authorization Act to ask the U.S. State Department to take action against foreign propaganda through an interagency panel. The legislation authorized funding of $160 million over a two-year-period. The initiative was developed through the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act.|$|E

25|$|The {{primary mission}} of the MSG is to provide security, {{particularly}} the protection of classified information and equipment vital to the national <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States at American diplomatic posts. This is accomplished under the guidance and operational control of a civilian federal agent of the Diplomatic Security Service, known as the Regional Security Officer (RSO) who is the senior U.S. law enforcement representative and security attachÃ© at U.S. diplomatic posts around the world. In addition, MSGs provide security for visiting American dignitaries and frequently assist the RSO in supervising host country or locally employed security forces that provide additional security for the exterior of embassies. The MSGs fall under operational control of the RSO and are administratively controlled by the Marine Corps Embassy Security Group. The secondary mission of Marine Security Guards is to provide protection for U.S. citizens and U.S. Government property located within designated U.S. Diplomatic and Consular premises during exigent circumstances, which require immediate aid or action.|$|E

[...] The SISS was headed by Democrat Pat McCarran and gained a reputation for careful and extensive investigations.

Lattimore was charged with perjuring himself before the SISS in 1952. After many of the charges were rejected by a Federal Judge and one of the witnesses confessed to perjury, the case was dropped in 1955.|$|E

500|$|In {{attempting}} {{to apply the}} Near and Pentagon Papers standards, the court {{was concerned about the}} prospect of publication causing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and potentially a global nuclear holocaust. The government did not {{go so far as to}} claim that publication might pose an immediate or inevitable danger, only that it [...] "would substantially increase the risk that thermonuclear weapons would become available or available at an earlier date to those who do not now have them. If this should occur, it would undermine our nonproliferation policy, irreparably impair the national <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, and pose a threat to the peace and security of the world." [...] However, the court still found that [...] "a mistake in ruling against the United States could pave the way for thermonuclear annihilation for us all. In that event, our right to life is extinguished and the right to publish becomes moot", and that publication could indeed cause [...] "grave, direct, immediate and irreparable harm to the United States", thereby meeting the test the Supreme Court had enunciated in the Pentagon Papers case. The preliminary injunction was therefore granted.|$|E
500|$|On April 3, Presley {{made the}} first of two {{appearances}} on NBC's Milton Berle Show. His performance, {{on the deck of the}} USS Hancock in San Diego, prompted cheers and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates. A few days later, a flight taking Presley and his band to Nashville for a recording session left all three badly shaken when an engine died and the plane almost went down over Arkansas. Twelve weeks after its original release, [...] "Heartbreak Hotel" [...] became Presley's first number-one pop hit. In late April, Presley began a two-week residency at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. The shows were poorly received by the conservative, middle-aged hotel guestsâ€”"like a jug of corn liquor at a champagne party," [...] wrote a critic for Newsweek. Amid his Vegas tenure, Presley, who had serious acting ambitions, signed a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures. He began a tour of the Midwest in mid-May, taking in 15 cities in as many days. He had attended several shows by Freddie Bell and the Bellboys in Vegas and was struck by their cover of [...] "Hound Dog", a hit in 1953 for blues singer Big Mama Thornton by songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. It became the new closing number of his act. After a show in La Crosse, Wisconsin, an urgent message on the letterhead of the local Catholic diocese's newspaper was sent to FBI director J.
