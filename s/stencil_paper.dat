40|$|Metal stencils {{are well}} known in {{electronics}} printing application such as for dispensing solder paste for surface mounting, printing embedded passive elements in multilayer structures, etc. For microprinting applications using stencils, the print quality depends on the smoothness of the stencil aperture and its dimensional accuracy, which in turn are invariably related to the method used to manufacture the <b>stencils.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> fabrication of metal stencils using a photo-defined electrically assisted etching method is described. Apertures in the stencil were made in neutral electrolyte using three different types of impressed current, namely, dc, pulsed dc, and periodic pulse reverse (PPR). Dimensional accuracy and wall smoothness of the etched apertures {{in each of the}} current waveforms were compared. Finally, paste transfer efficiency of the stencil obtained using PPR was calculated and compared with those of a laser-cut electropolished stencil. It is observed that the stencil fabricated using current in PPR waveform has better dimensional accuracy and aperture wall smoothness than those obtained with dc and pulsed dc. From the paste transfer efficiency experiment, it is concluded that photo-defined electrically assisted etching method can provide an alternate route for fabrication of metal stencils for future microelectronics printing applications...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{a broader}} effort to develop {{next-generation}} models for numerical weather prediction and climate applications, a hydrostatic atmospheric dynamical core is developed as an intermediate step to evaluate a finite-difference discretization of the primitive equations on spherical icosahedral grids. Based on the need for mass-conserving discretizations for multi-resolution modelling as well as scalability and efficiency on massively parallel computing architectures, the dynamical core is built on triangular C-grids using relatively small discretization <b>stencils.</b> This <b>paper</b> presents the formulation and performance of the baseline version of the new dynamical core, focusing on properties of the numerical solutions in the setting of globally uniform resolution. Theoretical analysis reveals that the discrete divergence operator defined on a single triangular cell using the Gauss theorem is only first-order accurate, and introduces grid-scale noise to the discrete model. The noise can be suppressed by fourth-order hyper-diffusion of the horizontal wind field using a time-step and grid-size-dependent diffusion coefficient, at the expense of stronger damping than in the reference spectral model. A series of idealized tests of different complexity are performed. In the deterministic baroclinic wave test, solutions from the new dynamical core show the expected sensitivity to horizontal resolution, and converge to the reference solution at R 2 B 6 (35 km grid spacing). In a dry climate test, the dynamical core correctly reproduces key features of the meridional heat and momentum transport by baroclinic eddies. In the aqua-planet simulations at 140 km resolution, the new model is able to reproduce the same equatorial wave propagation characteristics as in the reference spectral model, including the sensitivity of such characteristics to the meridional sea surface temperature profile. These results suggest that the triangular-C discretization provides a reasonable basis for further development. The main issues {{that need to be addressed}} are the grid-scale noise from the divergence operator which requires strong damping, and a phase error of the baroclinic wave at medium and low resolutions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Electron-beam {{lithography}} {{has long}} been employed for mask writing but the write time is increasing due to the escalating mask pattern complexity. Besides, electron-beam direct write (EBDW) is being pursued as an alternative solution for chip production in the sub- 22 nm regime. To improve the throughput of e-beam lithography, character projection method is commonly employed and a critical problem is to pack as many useful characters as possible onto the <b>stencil.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> we consider three enhancements in packed stencil design over previous works. First, {{the fact that the}} pattern of a character can be located anywhere within its enclosing projection region is exploited to facilitate flexible blank space sharing. Second, the use of multiple shaping apertures with different sizes is explored. Third, the use of overlapping shots for printing some characters is investigated. For the packed stencil design problem with flexible blank space sharing and multiple shaping apertures, two dynamic programming based algorithms are proposed, one allows overlapping shots and the other does not. Experimental results show that the proposed enhancement and the associated algorithm can significantly reduce the total shot count and hence improve the throughput of e-beam lithography.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} "stencil width" on surface ocean geostrophic velocity and vorticity estimated from differentiating gridded satellite altimeter sea surface height products. In oceanographic applications, {{the value of the}} first derivative at a central grid point is generally obtained by differencing the sea surface heights at adjacent grid points. This is called a "three-point stencil centered difference". Here the stencil width is increased from three to five, seven, and nine points, using well-known formulae from the numerical analysis literature. The discrepancies between velocities computed with successive stencils decreases with increasing stencil width, suggesting that wide stencil results are more reliable. Significant speed-dependent biases (up to 10 - 20 %) are found between results computed from three-point stencils versus those computed from wider stencils. The geostrophic velocity, and the variance of geostrophic velocity, are underestimated with thin stencils. Similar results are seen in geostrophic velocities computed from high-resolution model output. In contrast to the case when three-point stencils are used, wider stencils yield estimates of the anisotropy of velocity variance that are insensitive to the differences in grid spacing between two widely used altimeter products. Three-point stencils yield incorrect anisotropies on the 1 / 4 ° anisotropic AVISO grid; we recommend the use of 7 -point stencils. Despite the demonstrated inadequacies of the three-point stencils, the conclusions of earlier studies based on them, that the zonally averaged midlatitude eddy kinetic energy field is nearly isotropic, are found to pertain also with wider <b>stencils.</b> Finally, the <b>paper</b> also {{examines the}} strengths and limitations of applying noise-suppressing differentiators, versus classic centered differences, to altimeter data...|$|R
