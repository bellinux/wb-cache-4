5|$|By all accounts, Kanhopatra then died at {{the feet}} of the Vithoba image, but the {{circumstances}} were unclear. According to popular tradition, Kanhopatra merged with the image of Vithoba in a form of marriage—something that Kanhopatra longed for. Other theories suggest that she killed herself, or that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>killed</b> for her rebelliousness.|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} of the Campaign, it is {{revealed}} that Tychus was only released from his prison by Arcturus Mengsk, under the conditions that he had to assassinate Sarah Kerrigan, who had just been de-infested by the Xel'naga artifact's energy pulse. According to him, if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>killed,</b> he would go free. Raynor made the decision right there and blocked a shot from Tychus, intended for Kerrigan, and he shot his friend dead.|$|E

5|$|Eberhardt's {{acceptance}} by the Qadiriyya, an Islamic order, convinced the French administration {{that she was}} a spy or an agitator. She survived an assassination attempt shortly thereafter. In 1901 the French administration ordered her to leave Algeria, but she was allowed to return the following year after marrying her long-time partner, the Algerian soldier Slimane Ehnni. Following her return, Eberhardt wrote for a newspaper published by Victor Barrucand and worked for General Hubert Lyautey. In 1904, at the age of 27, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>killed</b> by a flash flood in Aïn Sefra.|$|E

5|$|Although Mansfield's film {{career was}} short-lived, she had several box-office successes {{and won a}} Theatre World Award and a Golden Globe. She enjoyed success {{in the role of}} fictional actress Rita Marlowe, both in the 1955–1956 Broadway version and the 1957 Hollywood film version of Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?. Her other major movie {{performances}} were for The Girl Can't Help It (1956), The Wayward Bus (1957), and Too Hot to Handle (1960). In the sexploitation film Promises! Promises! (1963), she became the first major American actress to have a nude starring role in a Hollywood motion picture. Mansfield took her professional name from her first husband, public relations professional Paul Mansfield. Mansfield's career came to an end when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>killed</b> in a 1967 car accident at the age of 34.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, Fleming took Washington to Hill County {{to prevent}} vigilante action. The Hill County sheriff, Fred Long, {{questioned}} Washington with Fleming; Washington {{told them he}} had killed Fryer following an argument about her mules, and described the murder weapon and its location. Long brought Washington to Dallas, Texas, while Fleming returned to Robinson. Fleming soon reported that he found a bloody hammer where Washington had indicated. In Dallas, Washington dictated and signed a statement that described the {{rape and murder of}} Fryer; the confession was published the next day in Waco newspapers. Newspapers sensationalized the murder, describing Fryer's attempts to resist Washington's attack, although the doctor who had examined her body concluded that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>killed</b> before she could resist. A lynch mob assembled in Waco that night to search the local jail, but dispersed after they did not find Washington. Nevertheless, a local paper praised their effort. That night, a small private funeral and burial were held for Lucy Fryer.|$|E

5|$|The Kathy Kane {{version of}} Batwoman was {{restored}} to modern continuity by writer Grant Morrison in flashback sequences in various issues of his {{run on the}} Batman-related titles, most explicitly in Batman Incorporated #4 (August 2011). This issue reveals {{the origin of the}} original Batwoman in current DC Universe continuity; she is Bruce's aunt by marriage. After she was widowed, she and Bruce fought side by side and were lovers for a time until it appeared <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>killed.</b> In that time, she worked reluctantly {{as a member of the}} spy organisation Spyral, which had employed her to uncover Batman's identity. Her biological father was also revealed to be the Nazi scientist Otto Netz (Doctor Dedalus). In 2013, in Morrison's final Batman Incorporated issue, Morrison then reveals that Kathy is alive working as an assassin for Spyral. Kathy then makes a few fleeting appearances in Grayson (2014–2016), referred to primarily as Agent Zero. In Grayson #8, during a fraught encounter between Dick Grayson and acting Spyral head Mr Minos, Kathy shows up to assassinate him.|$|E
5|$|On Friday 9 November, prostitute Mary Jane Kelly {{was murdered}} in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, behind 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. One of the earlier victims, Chapman, had lived in Dorset Street, and another, Eddowes, was {{reported}} to have slept rough there. Kelly's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10:45am lying on the bed. The first doctor at the scene, Dr George Bagster Phillips, believed that Kelly was killed by a slash to the throat. After her death, her abdominal cavity was sliced open and all her viscera removed and spread around the room. Her breasts had been cut off, her face mutilated beyond recognition, and her thighs partially cut through to the bone, with some of the muscles removed. Unlike the other victims, she was undressed and wore only a light chemise. Her clothes were folded neatly on a chair, with the exception of some found burnt in the grate. Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle. Kelly's murder was the most savage, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down on the bed, which would indicate that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>killed</b> by someone she knew, by someone she believed to be a client, or when she was asleep or intoxicated.|$|E
