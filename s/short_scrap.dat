6000|$|John Eames, {{as soon as}} he {{had left}} Mrs. Arabin at the hotel and had taken his travelling-bag to his own lodgings, started off for his uncle Toogood's house. There he found Mrs. Toogood, not in the most serene state of mind as to her husband's absence. Mr. Toogood had now been at Barchester for the best part of a week,--spending a good deal of money at the inn. Mrs. Toogood was quite sure that he must be doing that. Indeed, how could he help himself? Johnny remarked that he did not see how in such {{circumstances}} his uncle was to help himself. And then Mr. Toogood had only written one <b>short</b> <b>scrap</b> of a letter,--just three words, and they were written in triumph. [...] "Crawley is all right, and I think I've got the real Simon Pure by the heels." [...] "It's all very well, John," [...] Mrs. Toogood said; [...] "and of course it would be a terrible thing to the family if anybody connected with it were made out to be a thief." [...] "It would be quite dreadful," [...] said Johnny. [...] "Not that I ever looked upon the Crawleys as connections of ours. But, however, let that pass. I'm sure I'm very glad that your uncle {{should have been able to}} be of service to them. But there's reason in the roasting of eggs, and I can tell you that money is not so plenty in this house, that your uncle can afford to throw it into the Barchester gutters. Think what twelve children are, John. It might be all very well if Toogood were a bachelor, and if some lord had left him a fortune." [...] John Eames did not stay very long in Tavistock Square. His cousins Polly and Lucy were gone to the play with Mr. Summerkin, and his aunt was not in one of her best humours. He took his uncle's part as well as he could, and then left Mrs. Toogood. The little allusion to Lord De Guest's generosity had not been pleasant to him. It seemed to rob him of all his own merit. He had been rather proud of his journey to Italy, having contrived to spend nearly forty pounds in ten days. He had done everything in the most expensive way, feeling that every napoleon wasted had been laid out on behalf of Mr. Crawley. But, as Mrs. Toogood had just told him, all this was nothing to what Toogood was doing. Toogood with twelve children was living at his own charges at Barchester, and was neglecting his business besides. [...] "There's Mr. Crump," [...] said Mrs. Toogood. [...] "Of course he doesn't like it, and what can I say to him when he comes to me?" [...] This was not quite fair on the part of Mrs. Toogood, as Mr. Crump had not troubled her even once as yet since her husband's departure.|$|E

6000|$|I half fancy I {{can trace}} {{the origin of}} this {{personal}} affection for Virgil, which survives in me despite the lack of a very strong love of parts of his poems. When I was at school we met every morning for prayer, in a large circular hall, round which, on pedestals, were set copies of the portrait busts of great ancient writers. Among these was [...] "the Ionian father of the rest," [...] our father Homer, with a winning and venerable majesty. But the bust of Virgil was, I think, of white marble, not a cast (so, at least, I remember it), and was of a singular youthful purity and beauty, sharing my affections with a copy of the exquisite Psyche of Naples. It showed us that Virgil who was called [...] "The Maiden" [...] as Milton was named [...] "The Lady of Christ's." [...] I don't know the archeology of it, perhaps it was a mere work of modern fancy, but the charm of this image, beheld daily, overcame even the tedium of <b>short</b> <b>scraps</b> of the [...] "AEneid" [...] daily parsed, not without stripes and anguish. So I retain a sentiment for Virgil, though I well perceive the many drawbacks of his poetry.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} week there came a letter from Aunt Stanbury to Dorothy. It began by saying that Dolly had left behind her certain small {{properties}} which had now been made up in a parcel and sent by the railway, carriage paid.

[...] "She means to give them to you," [...] said Priscilla, [...] "and I think you must take them." [...] "And the shawl is no more mine than it is yours, though I wore it two or three times in the winter." [...] Priscilla was of opinion that the shawl must be taken also. Then the letter spoke of the writer's health, and at last fell into such a strain of confidential gossip that Mrs. Stanbury, when she read it, could not understand that there had been a quarrel. [...] "Martha says that she saw Camilla French in the street to-day, such a guy in her new finery as never was seen before except on May-day." [...] Then in the postscript Dorothy was enjoined to answer this letter quickly. [...] "None of your <b>short</b> <b>scraps,</b> my dear," [...] said Aunt Stanbury.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. A {{widening}} of the oonoept of stationarity {{leads to the}} concepts of smooth hetero-morphy and local homomorphy in stochastic series, obviating much {{of the need for}} the introduction of trend into structural specifications of statistical data. It is shown that formulae for sampling properties of local statistics in stationary stochastic series are applicable as they stand to series having these less restricted properties. 1. INTBODUCTION In a recent paper (1955 a) the author established the principle that the sampling properties, and notably the standard errors, of statistics constructed from local comparisons of terms in stationary normal stochastic series were approximately deducible from the short term variational properties of the series themselves. In making practical use of such statistics, {{it is not necessary to}} know the mean, variance, or serial correlations of the series, all of which are dependent on the long-term variational properties of the series; it suffices to know the values of the serial and lag variation functions for short lags, i. e. the mean semi-squared differences of terms in the series separated by distances which are short. This principle is important because in many practical applications the stretches of series which constitute the data are muoh too short to provide accurate and unbiased estimates of long-term variational properties, whereas accurate and unbiased estimates of the lag varia-tion functions for short lags can be obtained even, say, by combining evidence from <b>short</b> <b>scraps</b> of series having the same variational properties but different means. In recent papers the author has proposed the application of this principle in a number of techniques, including the following...|$|R

6000|$|True, we {{have heard}} Professor Forbes's book on Glaciers called an epic poem, and not without reason: but what gives that noble book its epic {{character}} is neither the glaciers nor the laws of them, but the discovery of those laws: the methodic, truthful, valiant, patient battle between man and nature, his final victory, his wresting from her the secret which had been locked for ages in the ice-caves of the Alps, guarded by cold and fatigue, danger and superstitious dread. For Nature will be permanently interesting to the poet, and appear {{to him in a}} truly poetic aspect, only in as far as she is connected by him with spiritual and personal beings, and becomes in his eyes either a person herself, or the dwelling and organ of persons. The <b>shortest</b> <b>scrap</b> of word-painting, as Thomson's [...] "Seasons" [...] will sufficiently prove, is wearisome and dead, unless there be a living figure in the landscape, or unless, failing a living figure, the scene is deliberately described with reference to the poet or the reader, not as something in itself, but as something seen by him, and grouped and subordinated exactly as it would strike his eye and mind. But even this is insufficient. The heart of man demands more, and so arises a craving after the old nature-mythology of Greece, the old fairy legends of the Middle Age. The great poets of the Renaissance both in England and in Italy had a similar craving. But the aspect under which these ancient dreams are regarded by them is most significantly different. With Spenser and Ariosto, fairies and elves, gods and demons, are regarded in their fancied connection with man. Even in the age of Pope, when the gods and the Rosicrucian Sylphs have become alike [...] "poetical machinery," [...] this is their work. But among the moderns it is as connected with Nature, and giving a soul and a personality to her, that they are most valued. The most pure utterance of this feeling is perhaps Schiller's [...] "Gods of Greece," [...] where the loss of the Olympians is distinctly deplored, because it has unpeopled, not heaven, but earth. But the same tone runs through Goethe's classical [...] "Walpurgis Night," [...] where the old human [...] "twelve gods," [...] the antitypes and the friends of men, in whom our forefathers delighted, have vanished utterly, and given place to semi-physical Nereides, Tritons, Telchines, Psylli, and Seismos himself.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} problem of allocating stocked fibers to made-to-order cables {{with the goals of}} {{satisfying}} due dates and reducing the costs of scrap, setup, and fiber circulation. These goals are achieved by generating remnant fibers either long enough to satisfy future orders or <b>short</b> enough to <b>scrap</b> with little waste. They are also achieved by manufacturing concatenations, in which multiple cable orders are satisfied by the production of a single cable that is afterwards cut into the constituent cables ordered. We use a function that values fibers according to length, and which can be viewed as an approximation to the optimal value function of an underlying dynamic programming problem. The daily policy that arises under this approximation is an integer program with a simple linear objective function that uses changes in fiber value {{to take into account the}} multi-period consequences of decisions. We describe our successful implementation of this integer program in the factory, summarizing our computational experience as well as realized operational improvements.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the agro-economic efficiency of intercropping carrot with cowpea-vegetable in relation to the amounts of biomass of Calotropis procera (Ait.) R. Br. (known locally as flor-de-seda) incorporated into the soil, and to different spatial arrangements. The study was carried out under field conditions from August to November of 2014, at the Experimental Farm 'Rafael Fernandes' of the Rural Federal University of the Semi-Arid (RFUSA), in Mossoró, in the State of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. The experimental design was a randomised complete blocks in a 4 x 3 factorial, consisting of a combination of four different amounts of flor-de-seda biomass incorporated into the soil (20, 35, 50 and 65 t ha- 1 of dry matter) and three spatial arrangements for the crop rows (2 x 2, 3 x 3 and 4 x 4). The carrot and cowpea cultivars used were ꞌBrasíliaꞌ and ꞌBRS Itaimꞌ. The characteristics under evaluation in the carrot were total, commercial and classified root production (<b>scrap,</b> <b>short,</b> medium and long). For the cowpea-vegetable, the following were evaluated: number, productivity and dry matter weight of green pods, number of grains per pod, 100 -grain weight and yield of green grains. The agro-economic efficiency indices evaluated in the intercropping were: land equivalent ratio for the system and partial land equivalent ratios for the crops, monetary advantage and modified monetary advantage. The greatest agro-economic efficiency with the intercrop system was recorded in the biomass amount of 30 t ha- 1 flor-de-seda. The 2 x 2 spatial arrangement resulted in greater system efficiency. The use of flor-de-seda as green manure is economically viable for the farmer when intercrop carrot with cowpea-vegetable...|$|R

The present work was conducted from June to November 2006, at Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Árido, Rio Grande do Norte State, Brazil, to evaluate the productive performance of two lettuce and two rocket cultivars in two cultures in strip-intercropping systems. The experimental design was randomized complete blocks, with five replications and treatments arranged in a 2 x 2 + 2 factorial. The treatments consisted of the combination of two lettuce cultivars (Babá de Verão and Tainá) and two of rocket (Cultivada and Folha Larga) intercropped with carrot 'Brasília' plus two additional treatments (two lettuce cultivars or two rocket cultivars grown in sole crop). In each block a plot with carrot in sole crop was grown. The evaluated traits in lettuce were plant height and diameter, number of leaves per plant, productivity and shoot dry matter mass. In rocket were evaluated plant height, number of leaves per plant, green mass yield and shoot dry matter mass; and in carrot: plant height, total and marketable productivity, besides root classes, in long and medium roots, <b>short</b> roots and <b>scrap</b> roots. The Tainá lettuce cultivar had the best yield performance both in sole crop and intercropping system.

A prática de consórcio é uma opção tecnológica viável para a produção de hortaliças e o sucesso da associação entre as culturas será tanto maior quanto maior a complementaridade entre elas. O presente trabalho foi realizado de junho a novembro de 2006, na Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Árido, Mossoró, Brasil, para avaliar o desempenho produtivo de duas cultivares de alface e duas de rúcula consorciadas em faixas com cenoura em dois cultivos. O delineamento experimental foi em blocos completos casualizados com cinco repetições, com os tratamentos arranjados em esquema fatorial 2 x 2 + 2. Os tratamentos consistiram da combinação de duas cultivares de alface (Babá de Verão e Tainá) e duas de rúcula (Cultivada e Folha Larga) consorciadas com cenoura 'Brasília', mais dois tratamentos adicionais (duas cultivares de alface ou duas cultivares de rúcula cultivadas em cultivo solteiro). Em cada bloco foi inserida uma parcela com a cenoura em cultivo solteiro. As características avaliadas na alface foram altura e diâmetro de plantas, número de folhas por planta, produtividade e massa da matéria seca da parte aérea; na rúcula: altura de plantas, número de folhas por planta, rendimento de massa verde e massa da matéria seca da parte aérea, e na cenoura: altura de plantas, produtividade total e comercial, percentual de raízes longas e médias, de raízes curtas e de refugo.

6000|$|This {{experience}} {{was to become}} when I had emerged from it the great reminiscence or circumstance of old Boulogne for me, and I was to regard it, with much intelligence, I should have maintained, as the marked limit of my state of being a small boy. I took on, when I had decently, and all the more because I had so retardedly, recovered, {{the sense of being}} a boy of other dimensions somehow altogether, and even with a new dimension introduced and acquired; a dimension that I was eventually to think of as a stretch in the direction of essential change or of living straight into a part of myself previously quite unvisited and now made accessible as by the sharp forcing of a closed door. The blur of consciousness imaged by my grease-spot was not, I hasten to declare, without its relenting edges and even, during its major insistence, fainter thicknesses; short of which, I see, my picture, the picture I was always so incurably [...] "after," [...] would have failed of animation altogether--quite have failed to bristle with characteristics, with figures and objects and scenic facts, particular passages and moments, the stuff, in <b>short,</b> of that <b>scrap</b> of minor gain which I have spoken of as our multiplied memories. Wasn't I even at the time, and much more later on, to feel how we had been, through the thick and thin of the whole adventure, assaulted as never before in so concentrated a way by local and social character? Such was the fashion after which the Boulogne of long ago--I have known next to nothing of it since--could come forth, come more than half-way, as we say, to meet the imagination open to such advances. It was, taking one thing with another, so verily drenched in character that I see myself catching this fine flagrancy almost equally in everything; unless indeed I may have felt it rather smothered than presented on the comparatively sordid scene of the Collège Communal, not long afterwards to expand, I believe, into the local Lycée, to which the inimitable process of our education promptly introduced us. I was to have less of the Collège than my elder and my younger brother, thanks to the interrupting illness that placed me so long, with its trail of after-effects, half complacently, half ruefully apart; but I suffered for a few early weeks the mainly malodorous sense of the braver life, produced as this was by a deeply democratic institution from which no small son even of the most soapless home could possibly know exclusion. Odd, I recognise, that I should inhale the air of the place so particularly, so almost only, to that dismal effect; since character was there too, for whom it should concern, and my view of some of the material conditions, of the general collegiate presence toward the top of the steepish Grand' Rue, on the right and not much short, as it comes back to me, of the then closely clustered and inviolate haute ville, the more or less surviving old town, the idle grey rampart, the moated and towered citadel, the tree-shaded bastion for strolling and sitting [...] "immortalised" [...] by Thackeray, achieved the monumental, in its degree, after a fashion never yet associated for us with the pursuit of learning. Didn't the Campaigner, suffering indigence at the misapplied hands of Colonel Newcome, rage at that hushed victim supremely and dreadfully just thereabouts--by which I mean in the haute ville--over some question of a sacrificed sweetbread or a cold hacked joint that somebody had been [...] "at"? Beside such builded approaches to an education as we had elsewhere known the Collège exhibited, with whatever reserves, the measure of style which almost any French accident of the administratively architectural order more easily rises to than fails of; even if the matter be but a question of the shyest similitude of a cour d'honneur, the court disconnecting the scene, by intention at least, from the basely bourgeois and giving value to the whole effect of opposed and windowed wall and important, or balanced and [...] "placed," [...] perron. These are many words for the dull precinct, as then presented, I admit, and they are perhaps half prompted by a special association, too ghostly now quite to catch again--the sense of certain Sundays, distinct from the grim, that is the flatly instructional, body of the week, when I seem to myself to have successfully flouted the whole constituted field by passing across it and from it to some quite ideally old-world little annexed musée de province, as inviolate in its way as the grey rampart and bare citadel, and very like them in unrelieved tone, where I repeatedly, and without another presence to hinder, looked about me at goodness knows what weird ancientries of stale academic art. Not one of these treasures, in its habit as it lived, do I recall; yet the sense and the [...] "note" [...] of them was at the time, none the less, not so elusive that I didn't somehow draw straight from them intimations of the interesting, that is revelations of the æsthetic, the historic, the critical mystery and charm of things (of such things taken altogether), that added to my small loose handful of the seed of culture.|$|R
