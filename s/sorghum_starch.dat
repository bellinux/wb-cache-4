Grain appearance in terms of pericarp colour, or presence or absence of pigmented testa, did not relate to the intense pink colouration of <b>sorghum</b> <b>starches.</b> Starch amylose content was significantly negatively correlated (γ = - 0. 88, p < 0. 001) to grain floury endosperm texture. <b>Sorghum</b> <b>starches</b> had higher peak viscosity (PV) in pasting than commercial maize starch. The time taken to reach peak viscosity from the initial viscosity rise was less for <b>sorghum</b> <b>starches</b> than maize <b>starch.</b> However, <b>sorghum</b> <b>starches</b> had a higher rate of shear thinning (Rst) than maize starch. There was a significant positive correlation between grain polyphenol content and starch PV (γ = 0. 75, p < 0. 05). Starch gel hardness was negatively correlated to pasting properties of Rst and paste breakdown (γ = - 0. 78 and - 0. 77 respectively) at p < 0. 01. Peak gelatinisation temperature (Tp) occurred over a narrow range from 66 to 69 °C. Tp was negatively correlated to the floury endosperm portion of the grain (γ = - 0. 77) at p < 0. 01.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryRebecca A. ReganSorghum {{is unique}} {{in terms of its}} {{resistance}} to drought and heat and is grown and consumed around the globe. Moreover, sorghum does not contain gluten and has potential in the gluten-free market. A blend of non-wheat flour, starch and hydrocolloid typically provide the structure of gluten-free products. Most research on sorghum bread uses a yeast leavened process, HPMC gum, rice flour and corn, potato, or tapioca starch. Little is known about the functionality or interactions of different starches and hydrocolloids in sorghum batter. The objectives of this study were to examine starch-hydrocolloid interaction in chemically leavened gluten free sorghum bread; to evaluate the effects of different ingredients on gluten free bread quality made with <b>sorghum</b> flour: <b>starch</b> (tapioca starch, rice flour and potato starch) : hydrocolloid (HPMC, locust bean gum and xanthan) and to develop a chemically leavened gluten free sorghum bread method. Bread was baked as pup loaves. Volume index was measured using the AACCI Method 10 - 91. 01 template, crumb grain was evaluated using the C-Cell Imaging System and texture was determined with the TA. XT Plus Texture Analyzer. The base formula was commercial <b>sorghum</b> flour, water, <b>starch,</b> hydrocolloid, sugar, salt, shortening and double acting baking powder. <b>Sorghum</b> flour: <b>starch</b> (tapioca starch, rice flour and potato starch) ratios of 70 : 30, 80 : 20 and 90 : 10 were tested. Loaves containing all levels of rice flour had the same volume index (~ 165) as 100 % sorghum flour (168) while all levels of tapioca starch and potato starch produced significantly smaller loaves (~ 150). The ratio of 90 % sorghum flour and 10 % starch (tapioca starch, rice flour and potato starch) was selected. The type and level of hydrocolloid significantly impacted loaf volume, grain and texture. Starch-hydrocolloid combinations which produced the best loaves were tapioca starch + 3 % HPMC, rice flour + 3 % xanthan and potato starch + 4 % xanthan. Following initial optimization experiment, egg ingredients, fat, baking powder and water were added and evaluated individually to develop an optimized formulation. In general, addition of egg ingredients, shortening and oil did not improve the overall quality of sorghum based bread and were not added to the formula. However, emulsified shortening was effective. The best level of emulsified shortening was determined to be 3 % for the breads with <b>sorghum</b> flour: tapioca <b>starch</b> or <b>sorghum</b> flour: potato <b>starch</b> and 5 % for bread made with sorghum flour: rice flour. The best baking powder (SALP and MCP) levels were 5, 8 and 5 % for <b>sorghum</b> flour: tapioca <b>starch</b> bread, <b>sorghum</b> flour: rice flour bread and <b>sorghum</b> flour: potato <b>starch</b> bread, respectively. Optimum levels of water for <b>sorghum</b> flour: tapioca <b>starch</b> bread, <b>sorghum</b> flour: rice flour bread, and <b>sorghum</b> flour: potato <b>starch</b> bread were 120, 110 and 120 %, respectively.

The highest hydrolysis rate coefficients for granular starches are at modification with 6 % OSA/starch. The largest molecular sizes of β-amylase hydrolysed OSA-modified gelatinised starches are found at modification with 24 % OSA/starch. The results suggest that octenylsuccinyl groups have an action-blocking effect on β-amylolysis of gelatinised starch, but the effect of semi-crystalline granular structure is more pronounced than that of OSA modification. Hence β-amylolysis can be used under appropriate conditions to modify the structure of gelatinised OSA-modified starches...|$|R

Sorghums Chirimaugute (medium-tannin), DC- 75 (high-tannin), and SV 2 (tannin-free) were steeped in water, dilute HCl (0. 9 %, v/v), formaldehyde (0. 05 %, v/v), and NaOH (0. 3 %, w/v) solutions before wet milling and starch separation. Pasting, textural, and thermal properties of starch were determined.

Initial results indicated that when a composite flour was used, the quality decreased with losses in both volume and crumb quality. This study, therefore, was directed toward identifying the component(s) responsible for these changes. Soft wheat and sorghum flours then were fractionated into their basic components and the sorghum fractions (lipids, water-solubles and starch) used to systematically replace the corresponding wheat fractions in a model high ratio cake system. ^ The sorghum lipids did not display the same functionality as did wheat lipids. The resulting cake had a greatly decreased volume and an inferior crumb structure.

40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that granule architecture influences patterns of reaction during chemical modification. Knowledge of granule microstructure provided {{in this study}} has advanced understanding of starch granule reactivity. A method for observing granular reaction patterns of modified starch is described that could facilitate characterization of starch reaction systems. ^ Most starch granules of common corn, waxy maize, sorghum, and millet were shown to possess radial, tube-like channels, which penetrated inward toward a cavity at the hilum. Channels varied in their frequency and distribution among granules, {{as well as in}} their depth of penetration. Central cavities, which were observed in almost all granules, exhibited a variety of shapes and sizes. Channels were not observed in starch granules isolated from corn kernels that had never been dried; rather they appeared to be formed during granule dehydration. The same is true of cavities, although the data is less conclusive. ^ Since channels and cavities increase available surface area for reaction and reagent entry into granules, their behavior was further investigated. Under slight swelling conditions (water), cavities were observed to swell somewhat closed, while channels appeared to remain open. Results from a model system (involving infiltration of granules with aqueous dye solution) supported the hypothesis that channels and cavities impact starch granule reactions. ^ To observe actual granular reaction patterns within modified starch granules, starch derivatives were converted to thallium(I) salts and viewed by SEM compositional backscattered electron imaging. Observation of a phosphorylated starch derivative and a hydroxypropyl starch analog revealed that granular patterns of reaction were influenced by both starch and reagent types. For waxy corn and <b>sorghum</b> <b>starches,</b> flow of reagent into the granule matrix seemed to occur through channels (laterally) and cavities (from the inside out). For potato starch granules, which do not possess channels, reagent diffused inward through exterior granule surfaces. With regard to reagent, POCl 3 (highly reactive) was more inclined to react at granule surfaces, while the propylene oxide analog (less reactive) appeared to diffuse further into granules prior to reacting. Together, the data support the hypothesis that granule architecture has an influence on the locus of reaction within a starch granule. ...|$|R

Significant variation exists between grains in the digestibility of starch within the rumen of cattle, being 0. 92 for oat grain, 0. 65 for maize and 0. 62 for <b>sorghum</b> <b>starch.</b> There are also striking differences between animal species in their capacity to digest cereal starch. The digestibility of <b>sorghum</b> <b>starch</b> across the whole digestive tract of poultry is extremely high (0. 99) compared with 0. 87 for cattle and 0. 30 for horses. Reasons for these observed differences in the energy value of cereal grains are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} ferulic acid and catechin on starch pasting {{properties}} were studied {{as part of}} an investigation into the structure and functionality of phenolics in starch-based products. Commercial maize starch, starches from sorghum cultivars (SV 2, Chirimaugute, and DC- 75), and the phenolic compounds ferulic acid and catechin were used in the investigation. Pasting properties were measured using rapid viscosity analysis. Ferulic acid and catechin (up to 100 mg each) were added to maize or <b>sorghum</b> <b>starch</b> (3 g, 14 % mb) in suspensions containing 10. 32 % dry solid content. Addition of catechin resulted in pink-colored pastes, whereas ferulic acid had no effect on paste color. Ferulic acid and catechin decreased hot paste viscosity (HPV), final viscosity, and setback viscosity of maize and <b>sorghum</b> <b>starch</b> pastes, but had no influence on the peak viscosity (PV) of the former. Both phenolics increased breakdown viscosity. Ferulic acid had greater influence on HPV, final viscosity, breakdown, and setback than catechin. Addition of catechin under acidic conditions (pH 3) decreased HPV, final viscosity, and setback of maize starch, but alkaline conditions (pH 11) slightly increased setback. Both acidic and alkaline conditions resulted in increased breakdown. Investigations on model-system interactions between ferulic acid or catechin and starch demonstrated that phenolic type and pH level both significantly influence starch pasting properties, with ferulic acid producing a more pronounced effect than catechin. The significance of these interactions is important, especially in food matrices where phenolics are to be added as functional food ingredients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Aspergillus flavus {{exhibited}} high {{growth and}} amylase production. Various Polysaccharides, including soluble <b>starch,</b> <b>sorghum,</b> cassava peel and maize induces high amylase production with maximal amylase activity at 2 % W/V. An initial linear increase in amylase activity with increase in substrate concentration was obtained up to 2 % W/V. An antagonistic relationship was obtained between amylase activity and substrate concentrations higher than 2 % W/V, {{in the culture}} filtrate of Aspergillus flavus grown in shake flasks. The maximum growth and amylase production was obtained on the sixth day of incubation at a pH of 7. 0 temperature of 29 ± 1 °C and 80 rpm. It is concluded from this study that cassava peel as well as sorghum may be an alternative carbon substrate for large scale cultivation of A. flavus for amylase production...|$|R
40|$|Nutritional {{value of}} eight sorghum hybrids, {{resulting}} from matings of four male lines with two male-sterile lines, was determined. The male lines were two sorghums with consistently high in vitro digestibility (High-digestibility 1 and Highdigestibility 2) and two sorghums with consistently low in vitro digestibility (Lowdigestibility 1 and Low-digestibility 2). The male-sterile lines were Kansas 52 and Redlan, two lines commonly used for genetic testing by sorghum breeders. The hybrids were fed to eight barrows fitted with ileal T-cannulas and also evaluated for starch digestibility in ruminal fluid. Corn {{was used as}} a control. Corn had greater ileal and total tract digestibilities of DM, GE, N, and starch than the hybrids, but was similar to the <b>sorghums</b> for <b>starch</b> digestibility in ruminal fluid. Ileal digestibilities were not different for the male-sterile parent lines, but hybrids of Kansas 52 had greater DM, GE, and N digestibilities over the total tract than hybrids of the Redlan parent line. Among the male parent lines, hybrids from the two lines with high in vitro digestibility had greater total tract digestibilities of DM, GE, and N than lines with low in vitro digestibilities. In conclusion, selection based on our laboratory procedure was an effective predictor of total tract nutrient digestibility of sorghum in pigs. Also, differences among parent lines for nutrient digestibility were still evident in their hybrid offspring...|$|R
40|$|Starch {{serves as}} {{the main energy source}} in cereal and tuber-rich diets, and its glycemic {{response}} profile has been associated with health-related conditions. Sorghum and millet are known to have relatively low starch digestibility, a potentially desirable property for controlling blood glucose response and providing sustained energy. Gastric emptying rates of traditional sorghum and millet-based African foods of the Sahelian region (couscous, thick and thin porridges made from millet and/or sorghum) were compared to those of non-traditional 2 ̆ 2 modern 2 ̆ 2 foods that are mostly consumed in urban areas using a non-invasive 13 C-labelled octanoic acid breath test in healthy volunteers. The obtained results showed that traditional sorghum and millet-based solid African foods had markedly slower in gastric emptying rate compared to rice, potatoes, and pasta as measured by lag phase and half-emptying time (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Factors that regulate gastric emptying of an ingested food are of interest since their understanding may help in controlling overall energy intake. In a second study, Polycose® solution (rapidly absorbed glucose) and slow digesting, cooked and washed alginate-based waxy starch-entrapped microspheres (of variable digestion rates) were consumed as a preload, followed 20 minutes later by a 13 C-labeled non-nutritive paste mixture. A comparatively fast emptying rate was observed when the paste was consumed alone whereas the slowest digesting starch-entrapped microspheres preload presented the slowest paste emptying rate as measured by the lag phase and the half emptying time parameters of the gastric emptying test (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). ^ Starch is also a dominant source of dietary energy in complimentary feeding of growing toddlers. After weaning, dietary glucose is generated mostly from starch which is the main component of most complementary foods. A new, non-invasive modified 13 C-breath test was used to assess pancreatic 2 ̆ 6 agr;-amylase activity, and the ability to digest <b>sorghum</b> porridge <b>starch</b> in healthy and moderately stunted toddlers from 18 – 30 months of age in Bamako, Mali. 2 ̆ 6 agr;-amylase insufficiency was present in both Malian healthy and stunted toddlers. However, children with 2 ̆ 6 agr;-amylase insufficiency digested, absorbed, and oxidized the released glucose from normal <b>sorghum</b> porridge <b>starch</b> at least as well as, and in some cases even better, than the healthy group, indicating that the 2 ̆ 6 agr;-glucosidases compensate for the 2 ̆ 6 agr;-amylase insufficiency, and particularly well in the stunted group. A thicker porridge and its 2 ̆ 6 agr;-amylase thinned counterpart were also digested well by the stunted group. ^ Overall, this work shows value of traditional African sorghum and millet foods and could lead to increased demand for local foods and, thus, provide better markets for smallholder farmers. The clinical study conducted on toddlers suggests that thick energy dense porridges supply digestible carbohydrates to stunted children, and that pending further study could be considered for supplemental feeding program...|$|R

40|$|The paste viscosities of sorghum {{and corn}} {{starches}} were studied with a Brabender viscograph. Sorghum starches and the laboratory-prepared corn starch gave higher paste consistencies {{than did the}} two commercial corn starches. Considerable variation existed in shear thinning of starches. In general, sorghum starches shear-thinned more than corn starches, although certain sorghum starches gave low shear thinning. When the hot pastes were sheared at high speed, sorghum starches thinned more than corn starches. The gelatinization characteristics {{did not appear to}} be related to shear thinning of sorghum starches. Swelling power at 95 C was lower for corn starch than it was for <b>sorghum</b> <b>starch.</b> Solubility of both corn and sorghum starches at 95 C varied among the cultivars.

40|$|The {{traditional}} kunun zaki {{production process}} has been improved upon. The usual 24 hours {{process has been}} shortened {{to a maximum of}} 12 hours. Steeping of the grains in warm water with 5 % sodium metabisulphite help in softening them. Liquefaction and saccharification of gelatinized <b>sorghum</b> <b>starch</b> with sweet potato and Cadaba farinosa crude extracts did not increase the amount of reducing sugar after 6 hours of incubation. Similarly, the specific density of the slurry remained the same after 6 hours of incubation with the crude enzyme extracts. Due to shortened saccharification process, the nutrient content of kunun zaki from improved process was a bit higher. The protein content was 5. 4 and 4. 1 % for the improved and traditional processes respectively. The product from improved process was preferred to that in the traditional process...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{efforts have}} been made in the USA and other {{countries}} to develop renewable feedstocks for production of fuels and chemicals. Among these, sorghum has attracted strong interest because of its many good characteristics such as rapid growth and high sugar accumulation, high biomass production potential, excellent nitrogen usage efficiency, wide adaptability, drought resistance, and water lodging tolerance and salinity resistance. The ability to withstand severe drought conditions and its high water usage efficiency make sorghum a good renewable feedstock suitable for cultivation in arid regions, such as the southern US and many areas in Africa and Asia. Sorghum varieties include grain sorghum, sweet sorghum, and biomass sorghum. Grain <b>sorghum,</b> having <b>starch</b> content equivalent to corn, has been considered as a feedstock for ethanol production. Its tannin content, however, may cause problems during enzyme hydrolysis. Sweet sorghum juice contains sucrose, glucose and fructose, which are readily fermentable by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and hence is a good substrate for ethanol fermentation. The enzyme invertase, however, needs to be added to convert sucrose to glucose and fructose if the juice is used for production of industrial chemicals in fermentation processes that employ microorganisms incapable of metabolizing sucrose. Biomass sorghum requires pretreatment prior to enzymatic hydrolysis to generate fermentable sugars to be used in the subsequent fermentation process. This report reviews the current knowledge on bioconversion of sorghum to fuels and chemicals and identifies areas that deserve further studies...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the effect of irrigation levels (five levels from 304. 8 to 76. 2 mm water) on the physical and chemical properties and ethanol fermentation performance of sorghum. Ten sorghum samples grown under semi-arid climatic conditions were harvested in 2011 from the Kansas State University Southwest Research-Extension Center near Garden City, Kansas, and evaluated. Irrigation had a significant effect on the physical properties, chemical composition, ethanol yield, and fermentation efficiency of sorghum. Sorghum kernel hardness increased and test weight decreased as the irrigation level decreased. <b>Starch</b> contents of <b>sorghum</b> samples grown under a low irrigation level were approximately 7 % less than those grown under a high irrigation level. Protein contents ranged from 9. 84 % to 14. 91 % and increased as irrigation level decreased. Starch pasting temperature increased significantly, and starch peak pasting viscosity and setback viscosity decreased as the irrigation level decreased. Free amino nitrogen (FAN) increased significantly as irrigation decreased. Ethanol fermentation efficiency ranged from 90. 6 % to 91. 9 % and correlated posi-tively with FAN during the first 30 h of fermentation (R 2 = 0. 926). Deficit irrigation level had a negative impact on ethanol yield. The sorghum with low irrigation yielded about 8. 9 % less ethanol (434. 52 mL ethanol per kg sorghum) than samples with higher irrigation (473. 32 mL ethanol per kg <b>sorghum).</b> Residual <b>starch</b> contents in the distillers dried grains with solubles was less than 1 % and ranged from 0. 70 % to 0. 84 %...|$|R
40|$|Three whole-plant sorghum silages, {{each with}} or without 25 % added rolled grain sorghum were fed to six medium-framed, ruminally {{cannulated}} steers in a 6 × 6 Latin square design. The grain sorghum silage rations (DeKalb 42 Y) had the highest DM, OM, and ADF digestibilities; the late-season forage sorghum silage rations (DeKalb FS 25 E), the lowest. Digestibility of NDF tended to be highest for the grain <b>sorghum</b> silage, but <b>starch</b> digestibilities were not affected by sorghum hybrid. Ruminal ammonia, acetate, propionate, butyrate, and total VFA concentrations were highest for the grain sorghum silage rations.

Ruminal pH was decreased, whereas VFA concentrations were not affected by grain supplementation. The grain sorghum silage had the highest nutritive value, and the middle-season forage sorghum silage (DeKalb FS 5) was superior to the late-season forage sorghum. These results are consistent with several of our previous trials, which compared grain and forage sorghum silages for growing (backgrounding) cattle...|$|R
