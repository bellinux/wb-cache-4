5|$|The finger {{bones of}} bats {{are much more}} {{flexible}} than those of other mammals, owing to their flattened cross-section and to low levels of minerals, such as calcium, near their tips. The elongation of bat digits, a key feature required for wing development, {{is due to the}} upregulation of bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps). During embryonic development, the gene controlling Bmp signaling, Bmp2, is subjected to increased expression in bat forelimbs—resulting in the extension of the manual digits. This crucial genetic alteration helps create the specialized limbs required for volant locomotion. The relative proportion of extant bat forelimb digits compared with those of Eocene fossil bats have no significant differences in relative digit proportion, suggesting that bat wing morphology has been conserved for over 50 million years. During flight, the bones take on bending and shearing stress; and the bending stresses felt are smaller than terrestrial mammals, however the <b>shearing</b> <b>stress</b> is larger. The wing bones of bats have a slightly lower breaking stress point than those of birds.|$|E

40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that exposing endothelial cells to steady or non-reversing pulsatile <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> produces a healthy, anti-atherogenic endothelium, whereas a reversing pulsatile <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> promotes an unhealthy, pro-atherogenic endothelium. To further investigate this hypothesis, a novel parallel plate flow chamber system {{was used to}} expose human endothelial cells to a pro-atherogenic reversing <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> waveform designed to simulate the wall <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> at the carotid sinus, a region prone to atherosclerosis. Cells exposed to this reversing <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> were compared to cells exposed {{to high levels of}} steady <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> (15 dynes/cm²), low steady <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> (1 dyne/cm², the time-average of the carotid <b>shear</b> <b>stress),</b> and static culture conditions. Functional analysis confirmed previous findings that reversing <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> increases cell proliferation and monocyte adhesion. Microarray results indicate that although there are unique sets of genes controlled by both low average <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> and by reversing flow, more genes were controlled by low average <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> We propose that low-time average <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> and not fluid reversal/oscillation, may be the more significant mechanical force. The reversing <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> system was also used to investigate two shear stress-responsive genes, CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 B 1.

Furthermore, AhR nuclear localization and CYP 1 A 1 protein expression correlate with the flow patterns in the mouse aortic arch.

Recoil is not mediated by actin polymerization-dependent mechanisms, as cytochalasin D had no effect on this early response. However, stiffening was determined in part by an intact actin cytoskeleton. Inhibiting myosin force generation with ML- 7 abolished the recoil and stiffening responses, implicating force generation by myosin as an important contributor to the early leukocyte response to fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> This initial <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> response may be particularly important in facilitating leukocyte attachment under sustained fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> by the flowing blood in the microcirculation...|$|R

Consequently, the heat transfer of a small element that {{is built into the}} wall and has a higher temperature than that of the flowing medium {{is a measure of the}} wall <b>shearing</b> <b>stress.</b> Theoretical considerations indicate that the wall <b>shearing</b> <b>stress</b> of the boundary layer can be defined by means of a heat-transfer measurement with an instrument mounted in the wall. Such an instrument is described. The calibration curve and its directional sensitivity curve are indicated. It permits the determination of the wall <b>shearing</b> <b>stress</b> in magnitude and direction...|$|E

This paper {{combine the}} {{traditional}} mechanical analysis with <b>shearing</b> <b>stress</b> analysis of GB springs, and presents a new stress method, It {{also points out}} that different types of suspension springs are suitable for stress method. Secondly, by the analysis of Solidworks Simulation of F 1 -XXX spring, the new <b>shearing</b> <b>stress</b> algorithm and security allowable stress are consistent with the CAE analysis results...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{identify}} the optimal design parameters for a jet nozzle which obtains a local maximum <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> while maximizing the average <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> {{on the floor of}} a fluid filled system. This research examined how geometric parameters of a jet nozzle, such as the nozzle 2 ̆ 7 s angle, height, and orifice, influence the <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> created on the bottom surface of a tank. Simulations were run using a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software package to determine <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> values for a parameterized geometric domain including the jet nozzle. A response surface was created based on the <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> values obtained from 112 simulated designs. A multi-objective optimization software utilized the response surface to generate designs with the best combination of parameters to achieve maximum <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> and maximum average <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> The optimal configuration of parameters achieved larger <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> values over a commercially available design...|$|R
40|$|The average bed and {{sidewall}} <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> in smooth rectangular open-channel flows {{are determined}} after solving the continuity and momentum equations. The analysis {{shows that the}} <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> are function of three components: (1) gravitational; (2) secondary flows; and (3) interfacial <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> An analytical solution in terms of series expansion is obtained for the case of constant eddy viscosity without secondary currents. In comparison with laboratory measurements, it slightly overestimates the average bed <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> measurements but underestimates the average sidewall <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> by 17...|$|R
