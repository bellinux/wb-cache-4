2500|$|This type {{of warfare}} {{differed}} from regular political warfare, as the Flower war {{was also used}} for combat training and as first exposure to war for new military members.

During Flower wars, warriors were expected to fight up close and exhibit their combat abilities while aiming to injure the enemy, rather than kill them. The main objective of Aztec Flower warfare was to capture victims alive for use later as human sacrifice, and offerings to the gods. When death occurred from battling in a Flower War, it was considered much more noble than dying in a regular military battle. Additionally, death in the Flower Wars contained religious importance as those who died were thought to live in heaven with the war god, Huitzilopochtli.|$|R
