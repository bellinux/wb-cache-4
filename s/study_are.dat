5|$|Analysis is the {{activity}} of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts {{in order to understand}} it. Reductionism can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of <b>study</b> <b>are</b> ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physics. Daniel Dennett distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls greedy reductionism, which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.|$|E

5|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about the {{historical}} and current population levels of the Southern fin whale. The IWC officially estimates that the Southern Hemisphere pre-whaling population was 400,000 whales and that the population in 1979 (at the cessation of Antarctic large scale whaling) was 85,200. Both the current and historical estimates should be considered as poor estimates because the methodology and data used in the <b>study</b> <b>are</b> known to be flawed. Other estimates cite current size to be between 15,000 (1983) and 38,000 (1997). As of 2006, there is no scientifically accepted estimate of current population or trends in abundance.|$|E

5|$|The factors used in {{determining}} how an individual aerodrome is categorised by the GASAR <b>study</b> <b>are</b> based broadly on size and facilities. The six types of aerodrome are described, in size order, as: regional airports (e.g. East Midlands); major GA airports (e.g. Oxford); developed GA airfields (e.g. Andrewsfield); basic GA airfields (e.g. Rufforth); developed airstrips (e.g. Tilstock); and basic airstrips (e.g. Chilbolton in Hampshire). The actual criteria used to categorise aerodromes were complex, using 28 different parameters, backed up with a peer review by experienced GA pilots.|$|E

Some so-called nothosections have been proposed, to accommodate natural ('ancient') hybrids (nothospecies).|$|E
5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} may {{be studied}} {{by a variety}} of techniques, including both direct and indirect observations. Two experimental techniques that have proved very useful in this area of <b>study</b> <b>are</b> field ion microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy.

In order to study surface diffusion on the atomistic scale it is unfortunately necessary to perform studies on rigorously clean surfaces and in ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions or in the presence of small amounts of inert gas, as is the case when using He or Ne as imaging gas in field-ion microscopy experiments.|$|E
