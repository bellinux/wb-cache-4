5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} in the Tony Hawk's series, Underground {{is centered on}} skateboarding {{in a series of}} levels. The player performs tricks via combinations of analog <b>stick</b> <b>and</b> button inputs. For example, the player initiates an ollie (a jump trick) by holding and releasing the jump button. During an ollie, the player may change the position of the analog <b>stick</b> <b>and</b> press one of two buttons to perform either a flip trick (such as an impossible or kickflip) or a grab trick (such as a benihana or nosegrab). The player can grind on certain edges and rails; different tricks may be performed during a grind based on the position of the analog stick. On quarter pipes, the player may execute lip tricks. While skating on flat surfaces, the player may manual in multiple ways via button combinations. Miscellaneous tricks include acid drops and wall-rides.|$|E

5|$|The Harrier has two control {{elements}} {{not found in}} conventional fixed-wing aircraft: the thrust vector and the reaction control system. The thrust vector refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction control is achieved by manipulating the control <b>stick</b> <b>and</b> is similar in action to the cyclic control of a helicopter. While irrelevant during forward flight mode, these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.|$|E
5|$|The Maceo empire soon {{extended}} beyond Galveston Island and gradually expanded throughout Galveston County {{with the family}} owning more than 60 businesses, as well as slot machines throughout the county. Investments in oil speculation helped to diversify the Maceos' portfolio and add to their wealth.

The aircraft featured a tricycle landing gear configuration with a nose landing gear leg and two main landing gear legs. The weapons bay was placed {{on the underside of the}} fuselage between the nose and main landing gear. The cockpit has a center <b>stick</b> <b>and</b> side throttle.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sticks</b> <b>and</b> handles {{could be}} made of gold, {{tortoise}} shell, ivory, mother-of-pearl, horn, or wood. They were often highly decorated.

5|$|Mario's {{abilities}} in Super Mario 64 {{are far more}} diverse than those of previous Mario games. The player can make Mario walk, run, jump, crouch, crawl, swim, climb, kick, or punch using the game controller's analog <b>stick</b> <b>and</b> buttons. Special jumps can be executed by combining a regular jump with other actions, including the double and triple jumps (jumping two and {{three times in a}} row, respectively), long jump and backflip. There are also special maneuvers, such as wall jumping—jumping from one wall to another in rapid succession to reach areas that would otherwise be too high. The player can pick up and carry certain items, an ability which is used to solve various puzzles, and swim underwater at various speeds. Mario's life energy slowly diminishes while underwater, representing how long he can hold his breath.|$|E
5|$|Monkey Fight: One to {{four players}} {{simultaneously}} engage in combat by rolling {{in any direction}} with the analog <b>stick</b> <b>and</b> using the A button to punch opponents with a boxing glove attached to their monkey's ball.

The player with the most points is declared the winner of a round when the in-game timer reaches zero. Items can be used to extend the reach, size, and strength of one's boxing glove.|$|E
5|$|Several {{types of}} incense clock have been found, {{the most common}} forms include the incense <b>stick</b> <b>and</b> incense seal. An incense stick clock was an incense stick with calibrations; most were elaborate, {{sometimes}} having threads, with weights attached, at even intervals. The weights would drop onto a platter or gong below, signifying that {{a certain amount of}} time had elapsed. Some incense clocks were held in elegant trays; open-bottomed trays were also used, to allow the weights to be used together with the decorative tray. Sticks of incense with different scents were also used, so that the hours were marked by a change in fragrance. The incense sticks could be straight or spiraled; the spiraled ones were longer, and were therefore intended for long periods of use, and often hung from the roofs of homes and temples.|$|E
