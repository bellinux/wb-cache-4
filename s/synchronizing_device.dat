40|$|Abstract—Several {{proposed}} chaos based ciphers ex-ploit the ergodic {{property of}} chaotic orbits. As chaotic systems are unstable and have sensitive dependence on ini-tial conditions, the main difficulty for the receiver is to re-produce the chaotic signal {{that has been}} generated by the sender in order to correctly decrypt the message. This is performed by a self <b>synchronizing</b> <b>device.</b> In discrete cryp-tography, the closest scheme is the so called self synchro-nizing stream cipher (SSSC). After recalling general se-curity models for assessing cryptographic algorithms, we present SSSC scheme and two examples of cryptanalysis. In order to resist to theses attacks, the ciphering function must satisfy high non-linearity properties which are pre-sented. 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} {{program has been}} designed to study behavior in populations of Spirochaeta aurantia cells, and this program has been used to analyze changes in behavior in response to chemoattractants. Three kinds of behavior were distinguished: smooth swimming, flexing, and reversals in direction of swimming after a short pause (120 ms). Cell populations exposed to chemoattractants spent, on average, 66, 33, and 1 % of the time in these modes, respectively. After the addition of a chemoattractant, behavior was modified transiently [...] smooth swimming increased, flexing decreased, and reversals were suppressed. After addition of D-xylose (final concentration, 10 mM), the adaptation time (the time required for the populations to return to the unmodified behavior) for S. aurantia was 1. 5 to 2. 0 min. A model to explain the behavior of S. aurantia and the response of cells to chemoattractants is described. This model includes a coordinating mechanism for flagellar motor operation and a motor switch <b>synchronizing</b> <b>device...</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective: to {{know how}} {{patients}} with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) use inhalators and to analyze most frequent errors. Methods: Crossectional descriptive study at Complejo Hospitalario San Millán-San Pedro. Two tests were done. The first one assessed theoretical knowledge on medication and inhalation technique, and inhalation devices. The second one assessed practical knowledge on inhalation technique for different devices, following Spanish Society of Pneumology and Thorax surgery recommendations. Technique was considered as incorrect if patient failed in any step. Results: 65 patients with COPD were recruited. On practical test, just 5 patients (7. 7 %) followed properly the inhalation technique. Errors, in order of frequency, were: not holding air after inhaling (apnoea), not move the device for a second inhalation (in pressurized devices), not exhaling air before inhalation, not moving the device for the first inhalation (in pressurized devices), not <b>synchronizing</b> <b>device</b> activation with air entrance, not energy inhaling air in powder devices. Conclusions: Most of the patients produced some error in the use of inhalator devices. So, it is necessary to provide patients with information and instructions about inhalation devices use...|$|E
40|$|A device (1) {{serves to}} detect the {{blocking}} of an electric motor connected to an a. c. power supply (Ph, Mp), said device having a measuring instrument (4) for measuring the e. m. f. voltage of the motor (10), a control device (2), a <b>synchronizing</b> <b>device</b> (3) and an off button (5). The off button (5) has an actuator (9) switched in series with the motor (10). With {{the help of the}} control device, the off button is controlled so that the flow of current to the motor (10) is interrupted for one a. c. voltage period, following which current is allowed to flow again during a voltage half-wave which is of opposite pole to the last voltage half-wave of the current-flowing phase. In this last current-flowing phase, there is an increased current drain and, as a result, there is a greater e. m. p. signal when the e. m. p. voltage is measured. As a result of this large e. m. p signal, the difference of the e. m. p. voltages between the blocked and non-blocked operating states of the motor is much greater and c an thus be evaluated more easily and more reliably (Fig. 1) ...|$|E
40|$|The topos of {{the window}} and {{analogous}} framing devices is one of the recurrent characteristics of Flaubert 2 ̆ 7 s work, and, as examples of this discretionary practice, one need recall only some of the many scenes that are framed by windows: the view of Yonville through the carriage window or the stainedglass window that is, very nearly, La Légende de Saint Julien l 2 ̆ 7 hospitalier. But windows are only incidentally our concern, for as the views of Yvetot and Constantinople equally signify something beyond themselves, so does this topos tie into a larger question, which is the evolution of Flaubert 2 ̆ 7 s practice of closure. The term evolution is meant as a temporal phenomenon only in referring to the order in which the major works were published or were to be published had not Flaubert 2 ̆ 7 s death intervened. Within this order (from Madame Bovary to Bouvard et Pécuchet and Le Dictionnaire des idées reçues) there is an obvious movement towards ever greater abstraction of character, narrative form and sequence, and causal and temporal referentiality. The atemporal aspect of this 2 ̆ 2 evolution” is that one can find Flaubert practicing at the same time, and during the composition of a single work, forms that will be either used or deferred, indeed as he deferred some entire projects in favor of others. Such a 2 ̆ 2 split 2 ̆ 2 practice can be seen in two scenes from Madame Bovary, one kept for publication and the other discarded, which serve as examples of two of the most prominent framing devices that Flaubert will use, with or without the topos {{of the window}}. In one case the window is a <b>synchronizing</b> <b>device.</b> In the other it is used to establish a diachronic series of successive views that compose a larger narrative unit. The main point of this essay is to show that the structure of synchronic framing and scenic closure is gradually displaced in importance by the diachronic series of open-ended episodes, each reiterative of the preceding in its failure to be resolved and in its search for a final disclosure that will enclose and close the search. Moreover, this development parallels an increased focalization of narrative point of view as well as the growing intrusion on narrative form of theatrical structures, at least as they were understood and practiced by Flaubert towards the middle of his career...|$|E

40|$|Phase-locked or APC loops {{have found}} {{increasing}} applications {{in recent years}} as tracking filters, <b>synchronizing</b> <b>devices,</b> and narrowband FM discriminators. Considerable work has been performed to determine the noise-squelching properties of the loop when it is operating in or near phase lock and is functioning as a linear coherent detector. However, insufficient consideration has been devoted to the non-linear behavior of the loop when it is out of lock and in the process of pulling in. Experimental evidence has indicated that there is a strong tendency for phase-locked loops to achieve lock under most circumstances. However, the analysis which has appeared in the literature iis limited to the acquisition of a constant frequency reference signal with only one phase-locked loop filter configuration. This work represents an investigation of frequency acquisition properties of phase-locked loops for a variety of reference-signal behavior and loop configuration...|$|R

40|$|Cloud storage {{offers a}} popular {{environment}} for users to store and share content. Yet, content sharing leads to multiple downloads {{of the same}} content when users <b>synchronize</b> <b>devices.</b> These downloads contribute to bandwidth waste and increase server workloads. To what extent does this occur? Would network caches alleviate the problem? The authors address these questions by investigating the traffic generated by Dropbox, a popular cloud storage service. Using data collected from four networks, they show that a large fraction (57 - 70 percent) of downloads generated by Dropbox users is associated with content shared among multiple devices. Moreover, despite optimizations such as the LAN Sync protocol, up to 25 percent of Dropbox download traffic comes from content replicas. The authors then evaluate an alternative synchronization architecture that uses caches to offload storage servers from such downloads. Their experiments show that the approach cost-effectively avoids most repetitive downloads, benefiting service providers, the network, and end users...|$|R
