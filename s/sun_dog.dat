Vädersolstavlan is prominently featured on the eastern wall just south of the platform where the terrazzo wall depicts the emblematic <b>sun</b> <b>dog</b> arcs interwoven with enlarged fragments of textiles.|$|E
25|$|Some have {{considered}} the vision in a solar context (e.g. as a solar halo phenomenon called a <b>sun</b> <b>dog),</b> which may have preceded the Christian beliefs later expressed by Constantine. Coins of Constantine depicting him as the companion of a solar deity were minted as late as 313, the year following the battle. The solar deity Sol Invictus is often pictured with a nimbus or halo. Various emperors portrayed Sol Invictus on their official coinage, {{with a wide range}} of legends, only a few of which incorporated the epithet invictus, such as the legend SOLI INVICTO COMITI, claiming the Unconquered Sun as a companion to the emperor, used with particular frequency by Constantine. Constantine's official coinage continues to bear images of Sol until 325/6. A solidus of Constantine as well as a gold medallion from his reign depict the Emperor's bust in profile jugate with Sol Invictus, with the legend INVICTUS CONSTANTINUS. The official cults of Sol Invictus and Sol Invictus Mithras were popular amongst the soldiers of the Roman Army. Statuettes of Sol Invictus, carried by the standard-bearers, appear in three places in reliefs on the Arch of Constantine. Constantine's triumphal arch was carefully positioned to align with the colossal statue of Sol by the Colosseum, so that Sol formed the dominant backdrop when seen from the direction of the main approach towards the arch.|$|E
500|$|... (Swedish for [...] "The <b>Sun</b> <b>Dog</b> Painting") is an oil-on-panel {{painting}} {{depicting a}} halo display, an atmospheric optical phenomenon, observed over Stockholm on April 20, 1535.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to predict the forms of <b>sun</b> <b>dogs</b> as would be seen on other planets and moons. Mars might have <b>sun</b> <b>dogs</b> formed by both water-ice and CO2-ice. On the giant gas planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune—other crystals form the clouds of ammonia, methane, and other substances that can produce halos with four or more <b>sun</b> <b>dogs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The same plate shaped ice {{crystals}} that cause <b>sun</b> <b>dogs</b> are {{also responsible for}} the colorful circumzenithal arc, meaning that {{these two types of}} halo tend to co-occur. The latter is often missed by viewers, however, since it is located more or less directly overhead. Another halo variety often seen together with <b>sun</b> <b>dogs</b> is the 22° halo, which forms a ring at roughly the same angular distance from the sun as the <b>sun</b> <b>dogs,</b> thus appearing to interconnect them. As the Sun rises higher, however, the rays passing through the plate crystals are increasingly skewed from the horizontal plane, causing their angle of deviation to increase and the <b>sun</b> <b>dogs</b> to move farther from the 22° halo, while staying at the same elevation.|$|R

2500|$|In 1539 Olaus Petri {{was ordained}} a priest, as {{permitted}} under Luther's reforms, and perhaps {{influenced by the}} <b>Sun</b> <b>dog</b> phenomenon of April 20, 1535 which caused Olaus to commission the mystical painting Vädersolstavlan and preach some apocalyptic sermons. However, shortly after his ordination, Olaus' relationship with King Gustav deteriorated sharply. Olaus was arrested and put on trial for treason, supposedly because he had learned about a conspiracy against the King during confession, and not revealed it. One historian suggests that Olaus' writings criticizing the King's harsh punishments, as well as taxation policies {{also contributed to the}} criminal trial. King Gustav also wanted to control the church, while Olaus distrusted the king's autocratic tendencies and supported religious self-government. [...] After Olaus Petri and Laurentius Andreae were found guilty on January 2, 1540, both received death sentences, and even his brother Lars signed the judgment. However, after much bargaining and many requests, friends managed to get both clergymen released on bail (Stockholm's merchants contributing to pay the stiff fines), although clearly their political careers had ended.|$|E
