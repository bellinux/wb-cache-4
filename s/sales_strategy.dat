On July 4, 2011 it was made available to pre-order on Life + Times, Jay-Z's lifestyle webzine, which redirected to Island Def Jam's website that featured the deluxe version available for $16.99, standard CD for $13.99, a deluxe digital version for $14.99, and standard digital album for $11.99. On July 22, its pre-order was made available on the iTunes Store. Internationally the album {{was released}} digitally on August 8 exclusively through iTunes, while its physical release was made available on August 12. Its deluxe CD edition was sold exclusively by Best Buy through August 23, when it became available at other retailers. The <b>sales</b> <b>strategy</b> received criticism from other retailers, who accused the labels of giving preferential treatment to iTunes and Best Buy. One of the most anticipated releases in 2011, Watch the Throne {{became one of the}} few major label albums in the Internet age to avoid a leak.|$|E

25|$|Task Review: Renaissance decided upon an Italian theme, but {{spent too}} long with their brand and pricing for the themed {{day that they}} could not buy from the wholesalers, thus forced to buy from {{elsewhere}} and resulting in increased food costs. Although their income was high and their services smoothed out after a shaky start, the team suffered from a lack of supplies that resorted to them cutting prices in half on their pizzas, with their expenditure being much higher due to their high cost overruns. Meanwhile, Alpha chose a Bollywood theme, yet while they managed to arrange all their printing for free, they were forced to cancel their lunch service due to the food not being prepared properly. They soon turned things around by focusing on a <b>sales</b> <b>strategy</b> of selling admission tickets for £5 that were redeemable against dinner, which proved to be a decisive idea as they secured a healthy profit, even before they had served a meal.|$|E

Editor Lee Hewitt commented in the Numismatic Scrapbook, [...] "it seems strange that Mr. Melish, living in Cincinnati, should be the distributor of the Cleveland issue." [...] The Cincinnati Musical Center coin had quickly sold out, the pieces Melish allowed on the market many times oversubscribed, but for the Cleveland piece, [...] "Melish's <b>sales</b> <b>strategy</b> had to be very different; the coins would have to be aimed at the Exposition visitors and the general public at $1.50 each, not at his own coterie of greedy speculators".|$|E
500|$|The Compilation of Final Fantasy VII {{was created}} by Yoshinori Kitase and Tetsuya Nomura, the {{respective}} director and character designer for Final Fantasy VII.

[...] Speaking on why VII had been chosen for such a project, Kitase explained that the ending left far more development opportunities open for characters and setting than other games in the series. There was also a strong financial benefit to creating the Compilation—following the unprecedented financial upturn prompted by the release of Final Fantasy X-2 {{just prior to the}} 2003 merger of Square and Enix into Square Enix, then-CEO Yoichi Wada decided that the company could tap into fan demands for continuations of the story of Final Fantasy VII.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective of the Research This {{research}} {{explores the}} global <b>sales</b> channel <b>strategies</b> of technology intensive startup companies. By doing so, the study aims at narrowing the prevailing research gap in this area. Previous literature has primarily focused on large multinational corporation’s <b>sales</b> channel <b>strategies</b> and on mainly conceptual contributions. Thus, the <b>sales</b> channel <b>strategies</b> of technology intensive startups have received limited attention, {{especially in the}} field of empirical research. Technology intensive startup companies often lack the knowledge and resources to develop detailed global <b>sales</b> channel <b>strategies</b> and thus, fail to sell their products to potential customers effectively. Therefore, it was seen as important to contribute to this crucial area of research. Given this, the objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate what determines a successful global <b>sales</b> channel <b>strategy</b> for a technology intensive startup. Methodology This study is qualitative and exploratory in nature. The utilized research method is a multiple case study, where four Finnish technology intensive startups were interviewed on their global <b>sales</b> channel <b>strategies.</b> The interviews aimed at identifying <b>sales</b> channel <b>strategy</b> best practices and success factors. An analytic induction approach, also known as abduction, was used for this research. In this approach, the researcher first deductively builds up a preliminary framework from existing theory, which is later inductively refined as a final analytical framework based on the empirical observations. Findings and Conclusions Based on the extensive literature review and in-depth empirical research, seven factors were found to determine the success of a global <b>sales</b> channel <b>strategy</b> for a technology intensive startup company. The found success factors were the following: clear company vision and <b>strategy,</b> <b>sales</b> channel structure, sales channel choice, high product quality, intermediary selection and support, seller competency and customer understanding. Especially the linkage of the overall company vision and <b>strategy</b> to the <b>sales</b> channel <b>strategy</b> was seen as important for the success of the sales channel. This study contributes to existing theory by offering a holistic perspective to the <b>sales</b> channel <b>strategies</b> of technology intensive startup companies and by finding critical success factors in this area. The main managerial implication of this thesis is the notion that <b>sales</b> channel <b>strategies</b> do have an impact on a startup’s success, as the employed <b>sales</b> channel <b>strategy</b> largely defines how and through which channel members the products are sold. This is why the <b>sales</b> channel <b>strategy</b> related matters require a significant amount of managerial consideration.

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, we have {{witnessed}} a growing trend for online service companies to offer “bundling sales ” to increase revenue. Bundling sale means that a company groups a set of its products/services and charges this bundle at a fixed price, which is usually less than the total price of individual items. In this paper, {{our goal is to}} understand the underlying dynamics of bundling, in particular, what is the optimal bundling <b>sale</b> <b>strategy</b> and under what situations it will be more attractive than the separate sales. We focus on online service markets that exhibit network effect. We provide mathematical models to capture the interactions between buyers and sellers, analyze the market equilibrium and its stability, and formulate an optimization framework to determine the optimal <b>sale</b> <b>strategy</b> for the service provider. We analyze the impact of the key factors, including the network effects and operating costs, on the profitability of bundling. We show that bundling is more profitable than separate sale in most cases; however, the heterogeneity of services and the asymmetry of operating costs reduce the advantage of bundling. These findings provide important insights in designing proper <b>sale</b> <b>strategies</b> for online services. I...|$|R
