When he {{discovered}} that the producers wanted no black people on the show, he argued <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> them that he lost the job. He also considered moving to England around this time, as Sir Lew Grade of Associated Television wanted Roddenberry to develop series and set up his own production company. Though he did not move, he leveraged the deal to land a contract with Screen Gems that included a guaranteed $100,000, and became a producer {{for the first time}} on a summer replacement for the Tennessee Ernie Ford Show titled Wrangler.|$|E

25|$|Fokine choreographed Sheherazade and Cleopatra. He also {{reworked}} Petrouchka and The Firebird. One of {{his most}} famous works was The Dying Swan, performed by Anna Pavlova. Beyond her talents as a ballerina, Pavlova had the theatrical gifts to fulfill Fokine's vision of ballet as drama. Legend has it that Pavlova identified <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> the swan role that she requested her swan costume from her deathbed.|$|E

25|$|Goethe's book {{provides}} {{a catalogue of}} how colour is perceived {{in a wide variety}} of circumstances, and considers Isaac Newton's observations to be special cases. Unlike Newton, Goethe's concern was not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> the analytic treatment of colour, as with the qualities of how phenomena are perceived. Philosophers have come to understand the distinction between the optical spectrum, as observed by Newton, and the phenomenon of human colour perception as presented by Goethe—a subject analyzed at length by Wittgenstein in his comments on Goethe's theory in Remarks on Colour.|$|E
25|$|On March 18, 2017, Turner {{played his}} final {{game in the}} Irish League. Fittingly, Killester matched-up against DCU Saints in the regular-season finale, giving Turner the proper send off amongst the two teams he had {{accomplished}} <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>with.</b> Turner bid farewell to Irish basketball with a 35-point effort in what was an 83–62 win for Killester. Killester finished the season in fifth position with a 13–9 record, and thus missed out on qualifying for the Champions Trophy tournament. Turner appeared in all 22 regular season games for Killester in 2016–17, averaging 21.6 points, 12.8 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 2.1 steals and 1.6 blocks per game. He was subsequently named to the Men's Super League All-Star First Team.|$|E

500|$|On December 27, 2009, Kariya {{received}} {{the sixth and}} last concussion of his NHL career, an elbow to the head delivered from behind by Buffalo Sabres' forward Patrick Kaleta. During what would become Kariya's last season in the NHL, the League began expanding their efforts to eliminate hits to the head with new rules and stiffer penalties. League officials also began looking to penalize [...] "blindside hits," [...] defined as a bodycheck against a player from the side, where he cannot see the ensuing player coming. At the time, Kariya called the pending rule changes [...] "long overdue," [...] adding that, [...] "hav been through <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> that...It's something that should've been in place years and years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{appearance}} of Samantha Mulder, {{this time as}} a clone of her from {{when she was still}} a little girl, was due to series creator Chris Carter's desire to bring her back. Carter felt Samantha was an important element of the show, referring to her as being part of the lifeblood of the series. The decision to kill the character X was made {{at the end of the}} third season. The writers felt that they could only do <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> the character and decided that they would either make him a bigger player on the show, or have him pay the price for collaborating with Fox Mulder. Ultimately they decided on the latter. This led to the introduction of Marita Covarrubias at the end of the episode, Mulder's latest informant.|$|E

[...] On August 5, despite being the world record holder in the 100-meter breaststroke, Hardy finished in seventh place {{with a time of}} 1:09.24. [...] At the first 50, Hardy came in first in 30.92, but faded badly at the end. Hardy did not blame her poor performances on her physical condition but rather her mental state. [...] On her final chance of making the team, on August 7, Hardy finished in second place in the 100-meter freestyle in 54.14, a personal best for her. [...] After the competition, Hardy said, [...] "I've been struggling <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> the pressure I put on myself, especially in the 100 [...] breaststroke." ...|$|E
500|$|Hey Venus! {{reflected}} the group's desire to [...] "capture {{the spirit of}} the band playing live in a room". The album was recorded [...] "very quickly" [...] and, as the band did not feel the need to [...] "experiment <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> such a simple record", is not particularly [...] "sonically adventurous". In Gruff Rhys's words Hey Venus! is [...] "a straight up album of songs... with key changes and a live band playing them" [...] with more emphasis [...] "on songs than the arrangement". According to Rhys [...] "nobody brought samplers into the studio, so there's far less electronics than on a lot of our records... a lot of electronic music is quite a solitary pursuit. You sit at your computer or sampler and sometimes it's more of an individual kind of thing. Whereas with this record, we were trying to play as a band: a five people at once kind of record." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the body}} of the Autobiography, Wideman writes, Haley's authorial agency is {{seemingly}} absent: [...] "Haley does <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> so little fuss ... an approach that appears so rudimentary in fact conceals sophisticated choices, quiet mastery of a medium". Wideman argues that Haley wrote {{the body of}} the Autobiography in a manner of MalcolmX's choosing and the epilogue {{as an extension of the}} biography itself, his subject having given him carte blanche for the chapter. Haley's voice in {{the body of the}} book is a tactic, Wideman writes, producing a text nominally written by MalcolmX but seemingly written by no author. The subsumption of Haley's own voice in the narrative allows the reader to feel as though the voice of MalcolmX is speaking directly and continuously, a stylistic tactic that, in Wideman's view, was a matter of Haley's authorial choice: [...] "Haley grants Malcolm the tyrannical authority of an author, a disembodied speaker whose implied presence blends into the reader's imagining of the tale being told." ...|$|E

500|$|Mulan {{served as}} Wen's first voice-acting role. In an {{interview}} with IGN, the actress elaborated on the recording process, specifically {{the fact that she}} was required to record the majority of the character's dialogue in isolation, saying, [...] "I just loved the story so much and identified <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> the character of Mulan it was easy for me. I loved using my imagination. I felt like I was a little kid again, being silly with an imaginary sword and riding on an imaginary horse and talking to an imaginary dragon. So it was a lot of fun for me." [...] In spite of the fact that, throughout the film, Mulan shares several intimate scenes with her guardian, a miniature Chinese dragon named Mushu who is voiced by American actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, Wen and her co-star never actually encountered each other while working on Mulan due to the fact that they recorded their respective dialogue at separate times in separate locations.|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} to have the character of X killed off in [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] was made {{at the end of}} the third season. The writers felt that they could only do <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> the character and decided that they would either make him a bigger character in the series, or have him pay the price for collaborating with Mulder. The show's producers decided to give Gillian Anderson's character Dana Scully cancer early in the fourth season. Carter initially discussed giving Scully's mother cancer but decided to have Scully suffer from it instead. Carter felt the move would give the show an interesting platform on which to discuss things such as faith, science, health care and a certain element of the paranormal. Some of the writing staff felt that the decision was a poor one to make, citing it as [...] "a cheap TV thing". However, Frank Spotnitz felt that, given the appearances of cancer-stricken abductees in previous episodes, it was an [...] "obligatory" [...] move to have Scully follow suit.|$|E
500|$|The {{new series}} on ITV saw {{a change in}} format, confronting the main fashion issues in Britain. In one episode {{exploring}} the theme of age, Constantine {{was transformed into a}} seventy-year-old with the use of prosthetics and makeup. She stated that it took her four days to get over the sight of herself aged so drastically, and compared the feeling to having an [...] "electric shock". Broadcasting was scheduled for 7 November 2007 and the programme is newly entitled Trinny & Susannah Undress The Nation. On 5 November and 28 December 2007 Constantine and Woodall appeared on Good Morning America and performed makeovers on three women for the show and gave style advice according to the women's shapes. They also reported on the fashion at the 80th Academy Awards especially for the show in 2008. Constantine and Woodall have dressed over 5,000 women as of 2007. With reference to their personal website, they state that their satisfaction remains with the many women they have helped and inspired and not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> the success of book sales and viewing figures.|$|E

500|$|Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} {{rating in}} the 0–100 range based on reviews from top mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 74 based on 6 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable" [...] reaction. Based on 7 reviews collected by review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an 86% approval rating, {{with an average}} score of 7.2/10. Deborah Young of Variety commented that [...] "The attention given to constructing each shot makes for a hypnotic visual experience, while lack of a progressive narrative telescopes film's running time into infinity." [...] Brian McKay of eFilmCritic.com gave the film 3 stars and summed up his review saying of the film [...] " [...] is a visually intriguing piece, it also ends up being highly repetitious and overlong." [...] The Village Voice praised the filmmaker for allowing the Ambassador Hotel, used many times previously as a film set, to represent itself and its own history. In their review wrote [...] "In its abstract movie-ness, O'Neill's 73-minute fantasia exudes a wistful longing to connect, not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>with</b> Hollywood history as {{with the history of}} that history".|$|E
500|$|Music critic Robert Christgau {{felt that}} Carey was being too {{political}} in her [...] "brave, young, idealistic attack" [...] on war and destitution.

[...] They continued to write that Carey's [...] "tone and clarity" [...] makes [...] "There's Got to Be a Way" [...] a [...] "mesmerizing" [...] track. To mark twenty-five years since the release of Mariah Carey in June 1990, Billboard writer Trevor Anderson wrote a track-by-track review of the album in June 2015. He noted that [...] "There's Got to Be a Way" [...] follows the same melodic tone as the album's opener [...] "Vision of Love" [...] but highlighted their stark lyrical differences, as the former is about social activism and the latter is about love. Although he praised Carey's vocals, writing that she [...] "deploys" [...] one of her best whistle notes of her career, he felt that [...] "the aim for broad appeal comes at the expense of memorable lyrics." ...|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, Ron tells Chris the changes do not play to his staff's strengths because Jerry only does well in the background, Tom only does well if people are all aware of his activities, and April only does well if people leave her the hell alone. Chris takes in Ron's well-reasoned arguments and they cut a deal where Chris will return everything to the way it was after Ron does one more week of interacting with the public. Nevertheless, Tom is frustrated with the experience and begins to contemplate leaving his city hall job to pursue his own entrepreneurial interests.|$|E
