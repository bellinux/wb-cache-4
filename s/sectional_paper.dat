40|$|Abstract. In {{the cross}} wedge rolling process, many factors must be {{controlled}} {{to obtain the}} required plastic strain and desired tolerance values. The major factors include the wedge relative velocity, the forming angle, the spreading angle, and <b>sectional</b> reduction. This <b>paper</b> uses rigid-plastic finite element (FE) DEFORMTM 3 D software to investigate the plastic deformation behavior of an aluminum alloy (A 7075) workpiece as it is processed for cross wedge rolling. This study analyzes the effective strain, the effective stress, and the X-axial load distribution of the workpiece under various rolling conditions. Furthermore, using simulation software to analyze the changes to the microstructure by the rolling process, this study presents analytical results that confirm the suitability of the current finite element software for cross wedge rolling...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that institutional arrangements influence the quality of monetary policy outcomes. Judged on its ‘transparency’ characteristics, therefore the Bank of England should do better than both the Bundesbank and ECB. However, studies based on market evidence show that on average, agents anticipate policy moves by both banks equally well. Since benefits from transparency should also show in a narrowing of the diversity in cross <b>sectional</b> forecasts, this <b>paper</b> extends the existing literature {{in an attempt to}} reconcile the contradictory evidence on ‘transparency’ of both banks. We show that the diversity in interest rate forecasts is greater under the Bundesbank/ECB than the Bank of England. Other factors than ‘transparency’ do not seem to affect interest rate uncertainty in Germany. Increasing difficulty in forecasting inflation appears to explain in part UK interest rate forecast dispersion. transparency, yield curve, forecasting uncertainty, Bank of England, Bundesbank, ECB...|$|R
40|$|In panel data the {{interest}} is often in slope estimation while taking {{account of the}} unobserved cross <b>sectional</b> heterogeneity. This <b>paper</b> proposes two nonparametric slope estimation where the unobserved effect is treated as fixed across cross section. The first estimator uses first-differencing transformation and the second estimator uses the mean deviation transformation. The asymptotic properties of the two estimators are established and the finite sample Monte Carlo properties of the two estimators are investigated allowing for systematic dependence between the cross-sectional effect and the independent variable. Simulation {{results suggest that the}} new nonparametric estimators perform better than the parametric counterparts. We also investigate the finite sample properties of the parametric within and first differencing estimators. A very common practice in estimating earning function is to assume earnings to be quadratic in age and tenure, but that might be misspecified. In this paper we estimate nonparametric slope of age and tenure on earnings using NLSY data and compare it to the parametric (quadratic) effect.

In this way it is not possi-ble to identify changes in behaviour over time, except maybe for changes re-lated to changes in population as dealt with in the Dutch national model. In Denmark the National Travel Survey has been conducted in 1975, 1981 and from 1992 and on. The data set forms a unique basis for creating a pseudo panel data set reflecting both time series changes and cross <b>sectional</b> effects. This <b>paper</b> shows the first results of analysing these data and estimating panel data models. The analyses focus on number of trips and kilometres per day both overall and by purpose. The results show that the number of trips per day has not changed significantly over the 90 ’es and 00 ’es. However, the kilometres have increased as a result of longer trips. Examining the trips by purpose shows significant differences in trends over the years...|$|R
40|$|Statistical {{analysis}} on the measured responses of a suspension bridge deck (Law, et al. 2007) show that vibration response at the first torsional mode of the structure has a significant increase at and beyond the critical wind speed for vortex shedding {{as noted in the}} wind tunnel tests on a <b>sectional</b> model. This <b>paper</b> further analyzes the measured responses of the structure when under typhoon conditions for any possible vortex shedding events. Parameters related to the lifting force in such a possible event and the vibration amplitudes are estimated with a single-degree-of-freedom model of the system. The spatial correlation of vortex shedding along the bridge span is also investigated. Possible vortex shedding events are found at both the first torsional and second vertical modes with the root-mean-square amplitudes comparable to those predicted from wind tunnel tests. Small negative stiffhess due to wind effects is observed in isolated events that last for a short duration, but the aerodynamic damping exhibits either positive or negative values when the vertical angle of wind incidence is beyond +/- 10 degrees. Vibration of the bridge deck is highly correlated in the events at least in the middle one-third of the main span. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the "associational democratic" model of relationship {{between state and}} civil society organizations, which recommends devolution of as many regulatory functions as possible to local groups and associations with detailed knowledge of problems and possible solutions, extensive monitoring capacities, and the potential to deliberate about generalizable as opposed to purely <b>sectional</b> interests. The <b>paper</b> seeks to introduce greater doses of realism in a model that has, so far, mostly been confined to abstract, normative discussions. It does so by discussing two themes in particular: the link between associational democracy and neo-corporatism, {{and the relationship between}} deliberation - a crucial element in the normative model - and bargaining. While neo-corporatism and associational democracy proceed from very different normative and empirical assumptions (the assumptions of the former being less appealing than those of the latter), many real-world examples of associational democracy are the result of the evolution and transformation of previous corporatist arrangements, and a neo-corporatist core remains solidly at their root. Also, real actors rarely deliberate; they bargain. Yet, not all bargaining is of the distributive kind. There is a type of integrative bargaining that retains many attractive features of deliberation itself, like truthful communication and problem-solving orientation, while falling short of the full array of normative preconditions. This kind of bargaining seems to capture what really happens in associational democratic fora better than the concept of deliberation...|$|R
40|$|External bonding of fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) composites {{has become}} a popular technique for strengthening of concrete structures all over the world. However, the plates are susceptible to debonding prematurely. Intermediate crack (IC) debonding (also known as axial peeling) {{is one of the}} mechanisms of debonding leading to failure. The IC debonding may arise at a major flexural crack to the plate end but occasionally it also propagates from the plate end, in the case of diagonal shear cracks. It is the mechanism of debonding that controls the flexural capacity of the beam as well as the <b>sectional</b> ductility. This <b>paper</b> deals with the investigation of IC debonding in tension for face-plated and side-plated reinforced concrete (RC) beams using different types of FRP plate material. The elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength of the plates of different materials vary between 28 - 300 GPa and 300 - 2800 GPa respectively. Tests show that the IC debonding is a gradual process in tension for face-plated beams in comparison to side-plated. The beam bonded with low modulus FRP (i. e., glass ERR) was more ductile than the carbon ERR plated beams. The analytical procedures adopted to draw the moment-curvature relationship in this study are capable of predicting the ultimate flexural capacity (M-peel) of the plated beams with very good accuracy, and are validated with test results from the present study and from the published literature.

40|$|Although {{the debate}} over the returns to {{vocational}} versus general education has become an important research in education, adequate empirical work in Africa is still lacking. We add new evidence to this debate by comparing returns to vocational and general education of workers in Tanzanian manufacturing firms. Whereas most of the previous evidences are based on cross <b>sectional</b> data, this <b>paper</b> provides a comparison of the returns to general and vocational education using firm level panel data with substantial information that allows a control for time invariant firm attributes, endogeneity of education and other worker- firm characteristics. Findings of this paper are that general education is more rewarding than vocational education and on the job training. The marginal rates of returns to one year of education ranges between 4. 8 and 17. 5 percent compared to the rates of returns to one year of vocational education that ranges between 1. 4 and 2. 8 percent. The results are stable even after we control for endogeneity, firm-worker characteristics and firm fixed effects. Therefore we reject the hypothesis that returns to vocational training are higher than the returns to general education. The paper also shows that at high level of general education unemployment in the Tanzanian labour market is low. Based on this papers findings vocational education cannot substitute general education. Hence it is justifiable for individuals to acquire more of general education and acquire vocational education and training after general education. There is economic rationale for allocating more resources to the general education...|$|R
40|$|Describes the Philosophy Department's {{assessment}} {{activities for}} the academic year 2013 - 2014. The Philosophy Department annual assessment report to the College for the Office of Academic Assessment. The department gathered data on all program SLOs, streamlined its assessment rubrics, and began analyzing four years of data towards ???closing the loop??? on the assessment process. Taking a broad view of assessment, the department addresses such results of its program overview as the homogeneous demographics of its majors. Cross <b>sectional</b> assessment of <b>papers</b> from 200 and 400 level courses going back to 2010 reveal ???an extremely insignificant increase??? in student performance with respect to SLO 1 (critical understanding of the Western philosophical tradition); nevertheless, {{the majority of students}} in both levels demonstrate a proficient or better understanding of the history of Western philosophy. Cross-sectional assessment of student papers in 300 and 400 level courses with respect to SLOs 2 - 6 reveal similar results, or perhaps a little ???worse. ??? Hypotheses to explain the results include course progression problems, with students taking 400 level courses prior to 300 level; the possibility of inter-rater unreliability is also suggested. As a way of addressing the possible reliability problem, in 2014 - 15 a committee of readers, as opposed to single course instructors, will evaluate student papers for SLO assessment. Previous advising attempts to guide students to take 300 level courses prior to 400 appear to need enhancement. Assessment of SLO 7 reveals a need to revise its currently distinct assessment methodology. A climate survey revealing most philosophy majors as being transfer students from community colleges leads to a conclusion that a future offering of more lower division courses would be beneficial in attracting students to the major...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{includes}} three papers. The first paper demonstrates how to estimate variance {{of change in}} poverty rates under rotating complex sampling designs. Measuring variance of change enables practitioners to judge {{whether or not the}} observed changes over time are statistically significant. The main difficulty in estimation of variance of change under rotating designs arises in the estimation of correlations between cross <b>sectional</b> estimates. This <b>paper</b> addresses a multivariate linear regression approach that provides a valid correlation estimator. Furthermore, poverty rate is a complex statistic that depends on a poverty threshold, which is estimated from the survey data. The paper mainly contributes by taking into account the variability of the poverty threshold in variance estimation of change. The approach is applied to the Turkish eu-silc survey data. The second paper presents a design based inference in the presence of nuisance parameters by using an empirical likelihood approach. The main contribution of the paper is to develop an asymptotic theory to support the approach. The approach proposed can be used for testing and confidence intervals for finite population parameters such as (non) linear (generalised) regression parameters. For example, when comparing two nested models, the additional parameters are the parameters of interest, and the common parameters are the nuisance parameters. Sampling design and population level information are taken into account with the approach. Confidence intervals do not rely on resampling, linearisation, variance estimation, or design effects. The third paper shows how the empirical likelihood approach proposed in the second paper is applied to make inferences for regression coefficients when modelling hierarchical data collected from a two-stage sampling design where the first stage units may be selected with un-equal probabilities. Multilevel regressions are often employed in social sciences to analyse data with hierarchical structure. This paper considers fixed effect regression parameters that can be defined through `general estimating equations'. We use an `ultimate cluster approach' by treating the first stage sample units as the units of interest...|$|R
40|$|Road traffic {{injuries}} (RTIs) are a {{major public}} health problem. Iran {{has one of the}} highest RTI mortality and morbidity rates in the world. This thesis aims to contribute understandings on fatal road-user patterns and characteristics as well as RTI numbers and rates, and to explore stakeholders perceptions both on barriers to - and facilitators of road-user safety and on prevention of this problem in the Iranian region. Quantitative and qualitative methods have been combined to explore road traffic injury phenomena. This thesis includes a cross <b>sectional</b> study (<b>Paper</b> I) and employs the capture-recapture method (Paper II), and grounded theory method (Paper III and Paper IV). Data for the first two studies were collected between March 2004 and March 2005 in the West Azarbaijan Province (WAP) of Iran and data for the third qualitative study were collected between March and December 2007 in both WAP and on the national level. Paper I describes the pattern of fatal RTIs and crash circumstances in WAP. The majority (85 %) of the deceased were men. Females were mainly killed as either car passenger or pedestrians. Close to two-thirds of victims were rescued by untrained people and nearly four out of five were taken to hospital by passenger car rather than by ambulance. Paper II presents two register-based studies estimating the number and rate of fatal RTIs in WAP employing the capture-recapture method. The Death Registration System (DRS) and Forensic Medicine System (FMS) had recorded 669 and 665 fatalities respectively (roughly 22 fatal RTIs per 100 000 inhabitants). The capturerecapture method estimated 1 018 deaths (34 per 100 000). Overall, the DRS and the FMS ascertained 65 % of the estimated number of fatal RTIs. In Paper III, the aim was to study pre-crash possibilities for prevention of RTIs and the core variable was identified as lack of system approach to road-user safety. Related barriers were identified: human factors; lack of safety in the transportation system; and lack of organizational coordination. Suggestions for improvement included education, more effective legislation, more rigorous law enforcement, improved engineering in road infrastructure, and an integrated organization to supervise and coordinate preventive activities. Focusing on post-crash management in Paper IV, the major barriers were identified as: involvement of laypeople; lack of coordination; inadequate pre-hospital services; and shortcomings in infrastructure. Suggestions for laypeople included: 1) a public education campaign in first aid, the role of the emergency services and cooperation of the public at the crash site, and 2) target-group training for professional drivers, police officers and volunteers involved at the crash scene. In conclusion the pattern of fatal RTIs in WAP differs somewhat from similar low- and middle-income countries. More attention should be paid to vulnerable road-users; young people, the over- 65 s and those living in rural areas. The burden of fatal road traffic injury in WAP is 1. 53 times higher than records in the current data sources suggest. The lack of a system approach to road-user safety was the most important concern in the stakeholder study. There is a need for both a major change in stakeholders attitudes to road-user safety and an integrated system to lead and coordinate all RTI prevention activities...|$|R
40|$|Background Adults with {{intellectual}} disabilities (ID) {{develop the}} metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease {{more frequently than}} individuals without ID. The knowledge about cardiometabolic risk factors in adolescents with mild/moderate ID is scarce. Aims The aims were 1) to examine cardiometabolic health among adolescents with ID 2) to study the progress of cardiometabolic risk factors from adolescence to young adulthood among young adults with and without ID 3) to evaluate whether a health-promoting program in an upper secondary school for students with ID could reduce cardiometabolic risk factors 4) to evaluate whether the plate model pattern, inlayed in a specially designed lunch plate, increases vegetable intake. Material and Methods Sixty-six adolescents with mild/moderate ID, mean age 18. 6 y recruited from one upper secondary school for students with ID (year 1 - 4) were investigated in a cross <b>sectional</b> study (<b>Paper</b> I). Controls were 90 students without ID, mean age 17. 8 y, recruited from practical and theoretical programs at schools nearby. In the follow-up study five years later 35 % (n= 23) of the now young adults with ID and 33 % (n = 30) from the control group were re-investigated (Paper II). Measures were anthropometrics, blood pressure, DXA, fasting blood samples and a submaximal cardiovascular fitness test. The multifactorial school intervention was evaluated on last year students {{after two years of}} intervention (n = 11) and compared with their base-line data (Paper I) and with last year students in Paper I (Paper III). The special plate with the plate model inlayed was evaluated in an observational study. The intervention group (n = 27) had eaten on the special plate during school lunches for at least six months. The control group (n= 62) was recruited from two other upper secondary schools for students with ID. Food intake was estimated from video recordings and digital photos (Paper IV). Results Adolescents with ID had a higher prevalence and severity of cardiometabolic risk factors together with low cardiovascular fitness compared to the control group. At follow-up as young adults (mean age 24. 3) 35 % were classified as obese and 22 % had developed the metabolic syndrome. Those without ID from practical educational programs also developed cardiometabolic risk factors but they did not reach the same level as the group with ID. After two years of school intervention cardiometabolic risk factors had decreased and no one were obese. Evaluation of the special plate showed no difference in vegetable intake between intervention and control group. Eighty-eight percent ate ≥ 37. 5 % vegetables. The intervention group chose food with a lower fat content and with more carbohydrates, had less plate waste and took fewer portions. Conclusions Already during adolescence individuals with ID have more cardiometabolic risk factors than those without ID and as young adults individuals with ID in this study has a cardiometabolic health and cardiovascular fitness similar to the Swedish middle-age population. Actions to promote healthy living habits during school hours including the use of the special plate were promising. This indicates {{that it is not the}} ID condition itself but the effects ID has on the living conditions that causes the high cardiometabolic risk. Thus, the results in this thesis shows that initiatives especially designed for individuals with ID to promote healthier living habits are required and are likely to be effective...|$|R
