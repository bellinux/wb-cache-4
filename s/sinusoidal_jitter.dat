40|$|<b>Sinusoidal</b> <b>jitter</b> is {{produced}} by simply modulating a clock frequency sinusoidally with a given frequency and amplitude. But this can be expressed as phase jitter, frequency jitter, or cycle-to-cycle jitter, rms or peak, absolute units, or normalized to the base clock frequency. Jitter using other waveforms requires calculating and downloading these waveforms to an arbitrary waveform generator, and helping the user manage relationships among phase jitter crest factor, frequency jitter crest factor, and cycle-to-cycle jitter (CCJ) crest factor. Software was developed for managing these relationships, automatically configuring the generator, and saving test results documentation. Tighter management of clock jitter and jitter sensitivity is required by new codes that further extend the already high performance of space communication links, completely correcting symbol error rates higher than 10 percent, and therefore typically requiring demodulation and symbol synchronization hardware to operating at signal-to-noise ratios of less than one. To accomplish this, greater demands are also made on transmitter performance, and measurement techniques are needed to confirm performance. It was discovered early that <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>jitter</b> can be stepped on a grid such that one can connect points by constant phase jitter, constant frequency jitter, or constant cycle-cycle jitter. The tool automates adherence to a grid while also allowing adjustments off-grid. Also, the jitter can be set by the user on any dimension {{and the others are}} calculated. The calculations are all recorded, allowing the data to be rapidly plotted or re-plotted against different interpretations just by changing pointers to columns. A key advantage is taking data on a carefully controlled grid, which allowed a single data set to be post-analyzed many different ways. Another innovation was building a software tool to provide very tight coupling between the generator and the recorded data product, and the operator's worksheet. Together, these allowed the operator to sweep the jitter stimulus quickly along any of three dimensions and focus on the response of the system under test (response was jitter transfer ratio, or performance degradation to the symbol or codeword error rate). Additionally, managing multi-tone and noise waveforms automated a tedious manual process, and provided almost instantaneous decision- making control over test flow. The code was written in LabVIEW, and calls Agilent instrument drivers to write to the generator hardware...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{characterize}} the effect of transmitter clock jitter upon receiver symbol synchronization performance. Using a sinusoidal model for the timing jitter, we evaluate the bit error rate (BER) degradation and cycle slip probabilities of receivers via analysis as well as simulation for uncoded offset quadrature-phase-shift-keying (OQPSK). We evaluate performance for two different symbol synchronization loops: the modified data transition tracking loop (M-DTTL) and the Gardner loop. The results are parameterized {{in terms of the}} timing jitter parameters (peak frequency jitter, time interval error, and cycle-to-cycle jitter) as well as symbol tracking loop parameters (loop damping factor, loop bandwidth). We present analytical expressions for BER degradation in the presence of <b>sinusoidal</b> timing <b>jitter</b> and compare results with those obtained via simulation, as well as past hardware tests of receivers. These results show that for both types of symbol synchronizers, peak BER degradation decreases as the loop damping factor increases, and that for underdamped tracking loops, the BER degradation peaks when the normalized jitter rate is approximately the same as the natural frequency of the loop transfer function. Simulated cycle-slip rates are also presented, showing the effects of varying loop bandwidths and damping factors. Finally, we illustrate how BER degradation can be characterized in terms of jitter time interval error and cycle-to-cycle jitter, providing predictive capabilities for receiver performance and guidelines for the specification of transmitter clock requirements.

40|$|Several {{workers have}} {{concluded}} that Gabor alignment tasks are performed by using central tendencies of the micropatterns as a cue. One reason for this conclusion was that the 3 -Gabor alignment task is performed equally well whether the orientations of the patches are collinear or orthogonal to the group orientation. We wished {{to find out if}} the orientation of the micropatterns has any effect on performance. We tested subjects in 3 -micropattern alignment tasks using a variety of orientational conditions. If three vertically-aligned Gabor patches were vertical, horizontal or both, or if bullseye or Gaussian blobs were used, no difference in performance was found. If, however, the orientation of the patches was randomized, performance became much worse. Similarly, if the three patches were at 45 deg, thresholds were raised. The effect of orientation was maintained across different spatial frequencies. Control conditions involving randomization of the phase of the <b>sinusoidal</b> carrier, or <b>jitter</b> on the size of Gaussian blobs, confirmed that a central tendency of the micropatterns was indeed being used by subjects, indicating that the role of orientation in this task is that of a mask, rather than of a cue...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—On-chip jitter {{measurement}} {{can be used}} {{to optimize}} the performance of wireline transceivers. In this work, the jitter of random data is measured on-chip by correlating the phase detector outputs from two adjacent CDR lanes. This allows the jitter's auto-correlation function to be estimated, from which the jitter's RMS value and power spectral density are extracted without using any external reference clock. The RMS value of random jitter ranging from 0. 85 ps to 1. 89 ps, and <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>jitter</b> from 0. 89 ps to 5. 1 ps is measured in PRBS 31 data with less than 0. 6 ps of error compared to measurements by an 80 GS/s real-time oscilloscope. Correlating the phase detectors in the CDRs with a third phase detector, which measures the phase difference between the clocks recovered by the two CDRs, allows measurement of the recovered clock jitter. Sinu-soidal jitter from 1. 8 ps to 5. 3 ps is measured in the recovered clock with an error of less than 1 ps.

40|$|Demand for {{low cost}} Serializer and De-serializer (SerDes) {{integrated}} circuits has increased {{due to the}} widespread use of Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) /Gigabit Ethernet network and chip-to-chip interfaces such as PCI-Express (PCIe), Serial ATA(SATA) and Fibre channel standard applications. Among all these applications, clock data recovery (CDR) {{is one of the key}} design components. With the increasing demand for higher bandwidth and high integration, Complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) implementation is now a design trend for the predominant products. In this research work, a fully integrated 10 Gb/s (OC- 192) CDR architecture in standard 0. 18 ? m CMOS is developed. The proposed architecture integrates the typically large off-chip filter capacitor by using two feed-forward paths configuration to generate the required zero and poles and satisfies SONET jitter requirements with a total power dissipation (including the buffers) of 290 mW. The chip exceeds SONET OC- 192 jitter tolerance mask, and high frequency jitter tolerance is over 0. 31 UIpp by applying PRBS data with a pattern length of 231 - 1. The implementation is the first fully integrated 10 Gb/s CDR IC which meets/exceeds the SONET standard in the literature. The second proposed CDR architecture includes an adaptive bang-bang control algorithm. For 6 MHz <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>jitter</b> modulation, the new architecture reduces the tracking error to 11. 4 ps peak-to-peak, versus that of 19. 7 ps of the conventional bangbang CDR. The main contribution of the proposed architecture is that it optimizes the loop dynamics by adjusting the bang-bang bandwidth adaptively to minimize the steady state jitter of the CDR, which leads to an improved jitter tolerance performance. According to simulation, the jitter performance is improved by more than 0. 04 UI,which alleviates the stringent 0. 1 UI peak to peak jitter requirements in the PCIe/Fibre channel/Sonet Standard...|$|E
40|$|Clock {{and data}} {{recovery}} (CDR) circuit and frequency synthesizer are two essential timing circuits in wireline and wireless communication systems, respectively. With multigigabits/s high speed links and emerging 4 G wireless system {{widely used in}} communication backbone infrastructures and consumer electronic devices, effective design of CDR and frequency synthesizer has {{become more and more}} important. The advanced scaled-down CMOS process has the limitations of leakage current, low supply voltage and process variation which pose great challenge to the analog circuit design. To overcome these issues, a digital intensive CDR solution is needed. Besides, it is desirable for the CDR to cover a wide range of data-rate and to be reference-less for improved flexibility. As for the frequency synthesizer design, the support for multi-standard to reduce the cost and area is desirable. In this work, a digital reference-less CDR is proposed to support continuous datarate ranging from 1 Gbps to 16 Gbps. The CDR adopts an 8 GHz~ 16 GHz DCO to achieve low random noise performance. A reference-less digital frequency locking loop is included in the system as the acquisition assistance for the CDR loop. To address the difficulty of jitter and stability evaluations for bang-band CDR, a Simulink model is developed to find out the jitter transfer (JTRAN), jitter generation (JGEN) and jitter tolerance (JTOL) performances for the CDR. The prototype CDR is implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process. The core area is 0. 68 mm². At 16 Gbps, the CDR consumes a power of 92. 5 mW and is able to tolerate a <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>jitter</b> with an amplitude of 0. 4 UI and a frequency of 4 MHz. The second part of this dissertation develops a frequency synthesizer for multistandard wireless receivers. The frequency synthesizer is based on an analog fractional-N PLL. Optimally-coupled quadrature voltage-controlled-oscillator (QVCO), dividers and harmonic rejection single sideband mixer (HR-SSBmixer) are combined to synthesize the desired frequency range without posing much phase noise penalty on the QVCO. The QVCO adopts a new phase-shift scheme to improve phase noise and to eliminate bimodal oscillation. Combining harmonic rejection and single sideband mixing, the HR-SSBmixer is developed to suppress spurious signals. Designed in a 0. 13 -μm CMOS technology, the synthesizer occupies an active area of 1. 86 mm² and consumes 35. 6 to 52. 62 mW of power. Measurement results show that the synthesizer frequency range, the phase noise, the settling time and the spur performances meet the specifications of the wireless receivers for the above standards. For a wide range frequency synthesizer, an automatic frequency calibration circuit (AFC) is needed to select proper oscillator tuning curve before the PLL settling. An improved counter-based AFC is proposed in this dissertation that provides a more robust and faster tuning curve searching process. The proposed AFC adopts a time-to-digital converter (TDC), which is able to captures the fractional VCO cycle information within the counting window, to improve the AFC frequency detection accuracy. The TDC-based AFC is designed in a 0. 13 -μm CMOS technology. Simulation results show that the TDCbased AFC greatly improves the frequency detection accuracy and consequently for a given frequency detection resolution reduces the AFC calibration time...|$|E
