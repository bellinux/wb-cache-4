That same year, he filed a $3million lawsuit against the producers of the 2010 direct-to-DVD film Camp Hell, claiming exploitation.

His lawsuit asserts various California law causes of action, including claims for unfair business practices and publicity rights.|$|E
25|$|It's Too Late to <b>Stop</b> <b>Now</b> is a 1974 live double album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison. It {{features}} {{performances that}} {{were recorded in}} concerts at the Troubadour in Los Angeles, California; the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, and the Rainbow in London, during Morrison's three-month tour with his eleven-piece band, the Caledonia Soul Orchestra, from May to July 1973.

25|$|During {{the summer}} months of 1973, Morrison had {{embarked}} on a three-month tour with his eleven-piece band, the Caledonia Soul Orchestra. Although the resulting concerts and live album, It's Too Late to <b>Stop</b> <b>Now,</b> {{have come to be}} known as a performing high for Morrison, the tour was physically and emotionally exhausting. Morrison decided afterwards to take a vacation break, returning to Ireland after a six-year absence obtensibly to record an RTÉ national TV show. Having gone through divorce proceedings earlier in the year, Morrison was now accompanied by his new fiancee, Carol Guida. The vacation visit lasted nearly three weeks during which time he only toured the southern part of the island and did not venture into his native Northern Ireland as the province was engulfed in the Troubles.|$|E

500|$|Bernard Perusse of The Gazette {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "more superficial but more positive" [...] than the 2006 biography [...] by Johnny Rogan. In {{a review of the}} book for The Palm Beach Post, Lisa McDonough wrote [...] "Steve Turner's Van Morrison: Too Late To <b>Stop</b> <b>Now</b> is not the final answer on Morrison – only Morrison could give that – but he does provide insights and updates as well as a solid background on Morrison's early life." [...] Writing for The Irish Times, John Boland was critical of the book's text but wrote positively of its images: [...] "Steve Turner's Van Morrison: Too Late to <b>Stop</b> <b>Now,</b> has a trite, fanzine style text and isn't very informative about the great man, but it has some splendid pictures and in its coffee table format is well worth the asking price". A review in the Herald Sun was critical: [...] "Too Late To <b>Stop</b> <b>Now</b> is more suited to the coffee table than a library shelf. It is browsing material, fleshed with snapshots, album covers, PR shots, posters and prints. The words are mere stitches, there to hold the pictures in place." [...] The Herald Sun noted that the author left out critical quotes from individuals that knew Van Morrison, and questioned Turner's objectivity.|$|E

500|$|Van Morrison: Too Late to <b>Stop</b> <b>Now</b> is a {{biography}} of musician Van Morrison, written by Steve Turner. It {{was first published in}} 1993 in the United States by Penguin Group, and in Great Britain by Bloomsbury Publishing. Turner first met Van Morrison in 1985; he interviewed approximately 40 people that knew the subject in his research for the biography. Van Morrison did not think positively of the biography, and multiple newspapers reported he attempted to purchase all of the book's 25,000 copies. He {{sent a letter to the}} author asserting the 40 individuals interviewed for the book were not his friends, and accused Turner of [...] "peddling distortions and inaccuracies about me personally".|$|E
500|$|Jonathan O'Brien {{recommended}} {{the book in}} a review in The Sunday Business Post, but noted it focuses more on his life than an analysis of his music: [...] "If you want a meticulously researched, mind-bogglingly detailed account of his early years growing up in Belfast, his schooldays in Orangefield, his time as an unpopular member of the Olympics showband and so on, then, once again, No Surrender is heartily recommended. If, however, you're expecting a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of Morrison's music, of its textures, its surfaces – how and why it sounds {{the way it does}} – then you've probably come to the wrong place." [...] O'Brien concluded his review by writing: [...] "For all its flaws, No Surrender is a strong, absorbing biography, and never less than well written. It's just that it could potentially have been far, far better." [...] John Beck of The Press Democrat observed that the biography [...] "paints him [...] as a mercurial genius at best and a cantankerous lout on a bad day". In their 2008 book Northern Ireland After the Troubles, Colin Coulter and Michael Murray referenced the biography and stated it puts forth [...] "the view that Morrison's persona has been shaped by a specifically Ulster Protestant sensibility". Bernard Perusse of The Gazette described the earlier biography Van Morrison: Too Late to <b>Stop</b> <b>Now</b> as [...] "more superficial but more positive" [...] than Rogan's book.|$|E

500|$|The {{book was}} {{selected}} as [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] in the Sunday Age, where Michael Gordon wrote: [...] "This is not the whole story, {{but it is a}} well-researched and superbly presented summary of the story so far – a kind of companion to the John Lennon book, 'Imagine' – including the temper tantrums. Fans may, however, disagree with the closing assessment that Morrison may be running out of themes and ideas to express." [...] Publishers Weekly was critical of the book's tone, commenting: [...] "Turner is more adulatory than probing." [...] The review noted: [...] "A complete discography makes this book a necessity for fans of the Irish Rover." [...] Writing for The Boston Globe, Thomas C. Palmer Jr. called the book [...] "a coffee-table biography that fills an extensive void, both for those hungry for gossip and for those who have wondered at the source of the creativity in this prolific producer of often stunningly original – if difficult to categorize – music". Palmer commented on the book's value: [...] "The value of the book is that it has at its heart the same subjects that most of Morrison's music has featured, subtly or otherwise (but never as blatantly as Dylan in his [...] "Saved" [...] period): religion and spirituality." [...] Robert Sandall reviewed the book for The Sunday Times, and wrote: [...] "Steve Turner has performed his task as a biographer diligently enough in Too Late To <b>Stop</b> <b>Now,</b> but the really interesting story here is told by the photographs." [...] Sandall commented: [...] "Thirty years of constant rowing with anybody who has ever tried to get close to him, and a fitful and irritable hankering after religion (any religion) have left him looking bloated, sad and, as Turner has the courage and decency to point out, not as great a musician now as his current reputation would suggest.

[...] Reviewing the album in Creem, Robert Christgau hailed it as Morrison's best since Moondance (1970) while writing, [...] "Songs that wore poorly or were just lame in the first place have more force and tightness here than in their studio versions". Ken Emerson was somewhat less impressed in Rolling Stone: [...] "On It's Too Late Morrison's voice is in fine form, but much else is not...The other musicians, most of whom have played with Morrison many times before, never detract, but Morrison could be better served....But the power of Morrison's vocals overcomes these drawbacks." [...] At the end of 1974, It's Too Late to <b>Stop</b> <b>Now</b> was voted the 20th best album of the year in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics, published by The Village Voice.

[...] Fellow biographer Johnny Rogan said that [...] "Morrison was in the midst of what was arguably his greatest phase as a performer." [...] Chris Jones of the BBC wrote: [...] "In a live setting all the hyperbole about Morrison's blend of genres into one Celtic, mystic vision makes perfect sense. This is soul music in a very real sense." [...] Hal Horowitz with American Songwriter, on reviewing the 2008 remasters of some of Morrison's albums, said, [...] "The classic is 1974’s double live It’s Too Late…, rightfully on anyone’s shortlist of finest concert albums. Van typically blows hot and cold on stage, but when he ignites on the oldies and choice blues covers here, few can touch him for pure blue-eyed soul passion."

[...] Many of them had prior experience working on Southern Pacific's located tunnels in the Tehachapi Pass. [...] Due to the sandstone composition of the mountain that was saturated with water and oil, frequent cave-ins occurred and the bore had to be constantly shored up by timbers during excavation. [...] The initial location for the north end of the tunnel near Newhall was abandoned due to frequent cave-ins caused by oil-soaked rock. [...] The north end of the tunnel excavation commenced in June 1875. [...] Water was a constant problem during construction and pumps were utilized to keep the tunnel from flooding. [...] Workers digging from both the north and south ends of the tunnel came face to face on July 14, 1876. [...] The bores from each end were only a half inch out of line with dimensions of [...] high, [...] wide at the bottom and over [...] at the shoulders.
