5|$|Some true fungi specialise in the {{colonisation}} of the Myxogastriae: {{almost all}} of these are species of sac fungi. The most common such fungus is Verticillium rexianummainly species from Comatricha or Stemonitis. Gliocladium album and Sesquicillium microsporum are often found on Physaridae, while Polycephalomyces tomentosus is often found on certain species of Trichiidae. Nectriopsis violacea specialises on Fuligo septica. Bacterial associates, mainly from the family Enterobacteriaceae, were discovered on plasmodia. The combination of plasmodia and bacteria can bind atmospheric nitrogen or produce enzymes which make possible the decomposition of e.g. lignin, carboxymethylcellulose or xylan. In a few cases, the plasmodia acquired <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> or tolerance of heavy metals through this association.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Seasonal {{changes in}} water {{chemistry}} and periphytic diatom assemblages were monitored for a saline, a subsaline, and a freshwater {{lake in the}} central Yukon Territory. Athalassic saline lakes, such as these, {{are believed to be}} extremely rare in arctic regions. All three study lakes exhibited a gradual shoreline retreat over the season (28 May to 22 August 1992) due to evaporative water loss. As the season progressed, the saline lake exhibited a marked increase in conductivity and salinity, similar to changes observed for inland salt lakes in more southern regions. The seasonal changes in water chemistry were less pronounced in the subsaline and freshwater lakes. The periphytic diatom populations of the saline lake closely tracked changes in the lake’s salinity, exhibiting a successional shift from taxa with low <b>salt</b> <b>tolerances</b> (e. g., Nitzschia cf. commutata and N. cf. palea) to those with high <b>salt</b> <b>tolerances</b> (e. g., Amphora acutiuscula) over the study period. Periphytic diatoms in the subsaline and freshwater lakes also exhibited marked successional changes, shifting to almost complete dominance by a single species (Cocconeis placentula and Achnanthes minutissima respectively), but these shifts were not related to lake water salinity alone.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAbscisic acid (ABA) -, stress- and ripening-induced protein (ASR) is plant-specific {{hydrophilic}} transcriptional regulators {{involved in}} sucrose stress and wounding in banana. However, {{it is not}} known whether banana ASR genes confer <b>salt</b> stress <b>tolerance.</b> The contexts {{of the study was to}} analysis the sequence characterization of banana ASR 1, and identify its expression patterns and function under salt stress using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and overexpression in Arabidopsis. The purpose was to evaluate the role of banana ASR 1 to <b>salt</b> stress <b>tolerance</b> employed by plants. ResultsA full-length cDNA isolated from banana fruit was named MaASR 1, and it had a 432 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 143 amino acids. MaASR 1 was preferential expression in roots and leaves compared to low expression in fruits, rhizomes and flowers. Under salt stress, the expression of MaASR 1 quickly increased and highest expression level was detected in roots and leaves at 4 h, and then gradually decreased. These results suggested that MaASR 1 expression was induced under salt stress. MaASR 1 protein was localized in the nucleus and plasma membrane. MaASR 1 was transformed to Arabidopsis and verified by southern and northern analysis, transgenic lines L 14 and L 38 integrated one and two copies of MaASR 1, respectively, while overexpression in transgenic lines provided evidence for the role of MaASR 1 to <b>salt</b> stress <b>tolerance.</b> ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that overexpression of MaASR 1 in Arabidopsis confers <b>salt</b> stress <b>tolerance</b> by reducing the expression of ABA/stress-responsive genes, but does not affect the expression of the ABA-independent pathway and biosynthesis pathway genes...|$|R
30|$|In summary, results {{presented}} in this study demonstrate that OsRACK 1 A functions as a stress-responsive gene and OsRACK 1 A RNAi transgenic rice can significantly improve <b>salt</b> stress <b>tolerance</b> through ABA-dependent and -independent pathway. As a negative regulator of salt stress response, OsRACK 1 A expresses rhythmically under normal conditions and shows the loss of cycling under salt stress. Although OsRACK 1 A interacts with many salt-responsive proteins, no directly evidence links OsRACK 1 A protein to salt stress related transcription factors, such as DREB and AP 2 /ERF. Further investigations on {{the identification of the}} functions of OsRACK 1 A interaction proteins will be helpful to elucidate the mechanism of OsRACK 1 A in regulating <b>salt</b> stress <b>tolerance.</b>|$|R
25|$|Another problem {{faced by}} many plants is high soil salinity. One {{study shows that}} some EcM fungi are capable of {{improving}} <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> in a species of poplar by altering leaf physiology. Though the symbiotic contact {{takes place at the}} root interface, the fungus was able to alter such leaf traits as concentration of nutrients and phytohormones, and ratios of fatty acids in order to combat leaf chlorosis and shedding. In seagrape seedlings, the EcM fungus Scleroderma bermudense was able to alleviate salt stress. In the seagrape tissue, there was a decrease in both sodium and chlorine, but an increase in potassium and phosphorus, implying this trend might represent a mechanism to explain the observed tolerance. Another study even identified 22 proteins differentially produced under salt stress of the EcM fungus Boletus edulis. They mostly concerned cellular processes such as metabolism, cell cycle control and stress tolerance, with 14 proteins being upregulated and 8 down.|$|E

40|$|Oshox 22 {{belongs to}} the homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) family I of {{transcription}} factors, most of which have unknown functions. Here we show that the expression of Oshox 22 is strongly induced by salt stress, abscisic acid (ABA), and polyethylene glycol treatment (PEG), and weakly by cold stress. Trans-activation assays in yeast and transient expression analyses in rice protoplasts demonstrated that Oshox 22 is able to bind the CAAT(G/C) ATTG element and acts as a transcriptional activator that requires both the HD and Zip domains. Rice plants homozygous for a T-DNA insertion in the promoter region of Oshox 22 showed reduced Oshox 22 expression and ABA content, decreased sensitivity to ABA, and enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses at the seedling stage. In contrast, transgenic rice over-expressing Oshox 22 showed increased sensitivity to ABA, increased ABA content, and decreased drought and <b>salt</b> <b>tolerances.</b> Based on these results, we conclude that Oshox 22 affects ABA biosynthesis and regulates drought and salt responses through ABA-mediated signal transduction pathways...|$|R

Isolation of probiotic bacteria {{from traditional}} dairy products {{can not only}} lead to the isolation of probiotic bacteria with special characteristics, but it can offer a good approach for the mass production of traditional dairy products containing natural probiotic bacteria. Materials and Methods: After collection of dairy products samples from different regions of Sabzevar, they were continuously cultured on the specific media of MRS and MRS Broth. Initial identification of isolates was performed by gram stain, motility test, nitrate reduction test, growth at 15 and 45 °C, growth at pH: 9 / 6 and fermentation capability of 11 different sugars. To identify desired strains more precisely, the 16 S rDNA gene was amplified by PCR with specific primers and then sequenced and BLASTed. Acidic and bile <b>salts</b> conditions <b>tolerance</b> tests were performed for the final confirmation of desired strains. Results: After continuous culture on specific agar media, 16 strains for further analysis were selected. In early identification of isolates by phenotypic methods, 14 strains were positive.

Following molecular identification and sequencing of 16 S rDNA gene, the BLAST sequence similarities were found with Lactobacillus planetarium. In addition, acidic and bile <b>salts</b> conditions <b>tolerance</b> tests showed that these bacteria had the best growth pattern at PH: 4 {{and they were able}} to grow in the presence of bile salts.
