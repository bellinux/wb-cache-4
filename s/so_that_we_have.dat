The visible parts of each face comprise five isosceles triangles which touch at five points around the pentagon. We could treat these triangles as 60 separate faces to obtain a new, irregular polyhedron which looks outwardly identical. Each edge would now be divided into three shorter edges (of two different kinds), and the 20 false vertices would become true ones, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a total of 32 vertices (again of two kinds). The hidden inner pentagons are no longer part of the polyhedral surface, and can disappear. Now the Euler's formula holds: 6090+32=2. However this polyhedron {{is no longer the}} one described by the Schläfli symbol {5/2,5}, and so can not be a Kepler–Poinsot solid even though it still looks like one from outside.|$|E

2500|$|In a September 1904 lecture in St. Louis named , Poincaré drew some {{consequences}} from Lorentz's {{theory and}} defined (in modification of Galileo's Relativity Principle and Lorentz's Theorem of Corresponding States) the following principle: [...] "The Principle of Relativity, {{according to which}} the laws of physical phenomena must {{be the same for}} a stationary observer as for one carried along in a uniform motion of translation, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no means, and can have none, of determining whether or not we are being carried along in such a motion." [...] He also specified his clock synchronization method and explained the possibility of a [...] "new method" [...] or [...] "new mechanics", in which no velocity can surpass that of light for all observers. However, he critically noted that the Relativity Principle, Newton's action and reaction, the conservation of mass, and the conservation of energy are not fully established and are even threatened by some experiments.|$|E

[...] In light of a Democratic held Senate and Presidency that oppose repeal, Bachmann called on the Republican held House of Representatives to not provide any funds for the implementation of the act [...] "But until we can see that [...] happen, we want to fully defund this bill so that, like, it would be akin to a helium balloon that gets no helium inside so that it can't take off the ground, and that's what we're planning to do.

[...] "It's also wrong that their pay is now lower than in 1997 or during SARS," [...] HIT general manager Gerry Yim Lui-fai told the South China Morning Post. Several long-serving stevedores working for Lem Wing Transportation and Everbest dismissed the strikers' claims as exaggeration. A 7-year veteran crane driver said [...] "It's not that we can't go to the toilet or don't have time for a meal... In fact, we have short breaks of two to three minutes between vessels berthing at the terminals. Very rarely can I get 15 to 30 minutes. We also take turns to have meals <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> around 15 to 20 minutes for mealtimes." [...] He said that he enjoyed a pay increase in 2011. Two Everbest employees said that, by working as a pair and managing their time during a 24-hour shift, they can alternate and work six or twelve hours. They said they took home HK$1,315 and HK$1,441, (between US$170 and $185) per shift, averaging HK$20,000 ($2,560) per month. They also said that some of their colleagues wanted to return to work, but were worried they would be chastised as spineless.|$|E
2500|$|In 1895 Poincaré {{argued that}} {{experiments}} {{like that of}} Michelson–Morley show {{that it seems to}} be impossible to detect the absolute motion of matter or the relative motion of matter in relation to the ether. And although most physicists had other views, Poincaré in 1900 stood to his opinion and alternately used the expressions [...] "principle of relative motion" [...] and [...] "relativity of space". He criticized Lorentz by saying, {{that it would be better}} to create a more fundamental theory, which explains the absence of any ether drift, than to create one hypothesis after the other. In 1902 he used for the first time the expression [...] "principle of relativity". In 1904 he appreciated the work of the mathematicians, who saved what he now called the [...] "principle of relativity" [...] with the help of hypotheses like local time, but he confessed that this venture was possible only by an accumulation of hypotheses. And he defined the principle in this way (according to Miller based on Lorentz's theorem of corresponding states): [...] "The principle of relativity, according to which the laws of physical phenomena must be the same for a stationary observer as for one carried along in a uniform motion of translation, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no means, and can have none, of determining whether or not we are being carried along in such a motion." ...|$|E
