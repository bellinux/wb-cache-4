40|$|A {{suspension}} encapsulates everything {{needed to}} execute a piece of code {{many times in the}} same context: the need for this feature exists in constraint solver programming, where (part of) a predicate checking the satisfiability of a set of a constraints needs to be re-executed every time the domain of a concerned variable changes. Traditional extensions of the WAM support a heap term and metacall based approach to this issue. The most efficient implementation of suspensions in the context of Prolog exists in B-Prolog. B-Prolog is based on the TOAM and <b>suspension</b> <b>frames</b> are put in the execution stack. They are notorioulsy cheap to re-enter. It is clear that the WAM could be adapted to allow <b>suspension</b> <b>frames</b> on the local stack. However, it is worth exploring a scheme that puts <b>suspension</b> <b>frames</b> on the WAM global stack (the heap). We describe in detail the few additions to a traditional WAM system to achieve this. Together with attributed variables that is enough to compile B-Prolog’s Action Rules to almost plain Prolog. We have enhanced hProlog with the required features to support <b>suspension</b> <b>frames</b> on the heap. We compare the performance of our Action Rules implementation with B-Prolog on a set of benchmarks previously used b...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of delay depends {{to a large}} extent on the following four basic operations: delay, wakeup, interrupt, and resume. Traditional implementations of delay in the WAM are slow because three out of the four basic operations need to save or restore the argument registers. In this paper, we present a novel method for implementing delay in a Prolog machine called ATOAM. The main idea is to store delayed calls as <b>frames,</b> called <b>suspension</b> <b>frames,</b> on the control stack rather than as records on the heap. Since delayed calls, after being woken, can be executed directly by using their <b>suspension</b> <b>frames,</b> the four basic operations become very simple. This method had been predicated to cost a large amount of control stack space. However, with tail-recursion elimination, the control stack space requirement can be reduced dramatically. This method has been implemented in the B-Prolog system. For several benchmark programs where delay is used, the experimental results show that B-Prolog is [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Newer <b>suspension</b> <b>frame</b> {{and fork}} designs have reduced weight, {{increased}} amount of suspension travel, and improved feel.

50|$|Many newer {{mountain}} bikes {{have a full}} suspension design. In the past, {{mountain bikes}} had a rigid frame and a rigid fork. In the early 1990s, mountain bikes started to have front suspension forks. This made riding on rough terrain easier on a rider's arms. The first suspension forks had about 1½ to 2 inches (38 to 50 mm) of suspension travel. Soon after, some frame designers {{came out with a}} full <b>suspension</b> <b>frame</b> which gave riders a smoother ride throughout the ride.|$|E
50|$|Because most full <b>suspension</b> <b>frame</b> designs {{either have}} a single pivot that is not {{concentric}} with the bottom bracket, or a linkage with a variable center of rotation, {{the distance between the}} bottom bracket and rear axle varies throughout the suspension's travel. This requires a sprung chain tensioner, similar to a rear derailleur, to be used. Only relatively uncommon frame designs with single pivots that are concentric with the bottom bracket allow the use of more desirable static chain tensioners. Another consideration is the generally increased amount of pedalling while standing up that is inherent to single speed mountain biking, which increases losses from suspension bob and squat. Therefore, full suspension mountain bikes are fairly rare, with hardtails and rigid bikes being much more common.|$|E

5000|$|Mountain bike {{suspension}} {{technology has}} made great advances since first {{appearing in the}} early 1990s. Early full <b>suspension</b> <b>frames</b> were heavy and tended to bounce up and down while a rider pedaled.

When braking efforts cause the suspension to compress it is referred to as brake squat, when braking causes the suspension to extend it is called brake jack.|$|R

40|$|Long-beam Precision Balances at the Universityof Tartu MuseumTullio IlometsUniversity of Tartu MuseumThere are {{a number}} of {{historical}} long-beam precision balances in theUniversity of Tartu Museum collection, most probably dating back to thefirst half of the 19 th century; this article introduces two of those balancesmore closely. According to oral tradition, the first of the balances belongedto Carl Ernst Heinrich Apollon Schmidt (1822 – 1894), a professor ofchemistry at the University of Tartu in 1847 – 1892, and the balance waspreserved in the department of chemistry chair of inorganic chemistry. The balance was handed over to the museum in 1982. The secondlarge analytical balance, a so-called one-kilogram scale was made inthe workshop of the famous Berlin balance craftsman Johann AugustDaniel Oertling (1803 – 1866). The balance bears the inscription: Aug. Oertling in Berlin № 1329. The balance was handed over to the museumby the chair of inorganic chemistry on 11 June 1993. The balance of Carl Schmidt can be disassembled into five partsthat are packed into the drawers of a mahogany balance case, eachpart to its proper place. The balance is made of light brass. The measurementsof the balance case are 51. 5 x 13. 5 x 8. 5 cm. The drawer ofthe case can be locked. On top of the case, there is a brass plate withthe measurements 3. 0 x 3. 0 x 0. 6 cm in the centre of which there is athreaded opening, where the column is connected. The front edge andedges of the balance case have metal feet the height of which can beadjusted. The main part of the column supporting the balance beamis a 1. 9 cm-in-diameter solid brass cylinder, while the eccentric andscales are situated just below it. There is a console attached to the toppart of the column; on top of that, there are two round agate plates,which support the knife edge of the beam’s prism. The full length ofthe column is 28. 5 cm. The moving part of the column consists of twocylinders that are connected with three rods, are positioned aroundthe column and can be moved up and down. A frame with two notchessurrounding the console and a forked arrestment device for the beampositioned perpendicularly with the frame are attached to the uppercylinder. The lower edge of the lower cylinder touches the eccentric. If one rotates the eccentric, the frame moves up and positions itselfin the notches above the prisms’ ends, the forked arrestment devicefixes both sides of the beam in the grooves at the ends of the forks. This system of arresting the balance beam was first used by AugustOertling. The arresting system of Carl Schmidt’s balance is very similarto an Oertling-type balance described in older literature. Thisexcept for the fact that in case of Oerlting’s balance, the arrestmentsystem of the balance is lifted by the eccentric {{with the aid of a}} rodwithin the column. Carl Schmidt’s precision balance has a rhombicstructural beam with two vertical crossbars. The beam is graduatedon one side for the manual positioning of the rider. The length of thebeam is 42 cm. In the middle of the beam on its upper edge there is adevice that allows regulating the centre of gravity of the beam; on thelower edge there is a downward pointed needle. On both ends of thebalance beam there are the so-called swan necks that are bent upwardsinto curves and have two regulating screws; their lower endsare circle-shaped and the suspension threads of the balance bowlsare attached to these. Oertling’s balance also has these swan necks. The balance has no notations regarding its manufacturer, as wellas the time and place it was made. Neither does it have a universityinventory number. We may presume that the balance is an earlierversion of an Oertling-type balance and it belonged to Carl Schmidtpersonally. Judging by construction, the balance was made in thefirst half of the 19 th century. Oertling’s large analytical precision balance is made of brass andpreserved in a mahogany case, which has glazed doors on the sides andglazed wooden frames that can be lifted to the required height on thefront and back sides. There are two brass feet with adjustable heightunder the balance at the corners on the front side and a single brass footin the centre of the back side. The balance case can be locked. There aredampers that hinder the oscillation of the balance bowls in the bottomof the balance case. Front centre, there is a round fluid level for levellingthe balance. Under the balance bowls, there is a round hole in the bottomof the balance case, and it has a brass cover that can be slid aside. A device for mounting the reiter balance beam is attached to the ceilingand right-hand inner wall of the case. The measurements of the balancecase are 80. 0 x 54. 0 x 24. 0 cm. The height of the lower part of the caseis 6. 0 cm. The balance column is attached to a brass plate measuring 16. 0 x 8. 3 x 0. 7 cm at the bottom of the case. At the point where the liftingmechanism side forks come out of the column, the diameter of thecolumn is 4. 0 cm, upwards, it is 3. 0 cm. The total length of the column is 27. 7 cm. A plate measuring 4. 0 cm x 4. 0 cm x 0. 9 cm has been attachedon top of the upper plate of the column; on top of that, there are twoparallel-positioned 5. 8 cm high bearers that are 1. 2 cm apart – theseare meant for supporting the round agate plates. A scales mountingframe with a rhombic structure attached with six vertical crossbars isattached to the back of the column; its length together with the scalesis 61. 5 cm. The moving part of the balance column is made up of thebeam’s arresting frame that is 67. 0 cm long and consists of two halves 2. 8 cm apart from each other. Both sides of the frame have a rhombicstructure as well and they have six vertical crossbars. The central partof the frame, which is 5. 4 cm high, is attached to the plate at the bottomon both sides; the plate features holes that fit the agate plate bearersexactly. The plate is connected to the tip of the rod that moves up anddown inside the column. A triangular notch is aligned with the prismat the extension of the upper side of the frame’s central part. The twosides of the arrestment frame have been connected with cross strips,while external rods that are 30. 0 cm long, reach out from the openingsin the lower part of the column, and are connected to the rod inside thecolumn, are attached to the strips. On the ends of the arrestment frame,there are triangular notches above the balance beam’s end prisms onthe upper edge. Upon arrestment, the frame lifts the middle prism of thebeam from the agate plates into the notches. At the ends of the beam,the frame lifts the forked <b>suspension</b> <b>frame</b> of the balance bowl togetherwith the agate plates from the prisms into the notches. The upwardsand downwards movement amplitude of the frame is 1. 0 cm. The balancecan be arrested with a disc on top of the balance case, which is connectedto a lifting mechanism inside the column via the axis. Oertling’slarge scale has a rhombic beam with six vertical crossbars; its lengthis 55. 0 cm, its width at the point of the supporting prism is 5. 0 cm andthickness 0. 9 cm. In the centre of the beam on its upper edge above thesupporting prism there is a device for regulating the centre of gravity ofthe balance beam. The beam has no pointer. The ends of the beam areforked. The upper forks have points that reach the scales. The beam isbalanced when the points are on 0 noted on the scales. The lower forks ofthe beam ends have prisms that carry the balance bowls. The front partof the beam’s upper edge on both sides of the prism is graduated. Thereare two graduations: upper and lower. The lower starts from the middleprism and runs to 10. The upper graduation starts from the middle ofone side of the beam with 0 and runs to 10 on both sides of the 0, whileeach of the units is divided into five parts in their turn. The diameter ofa balance bowl is 10. 0 cm. Under the balance bowl in the middle, thereis a loop, which can be used to attach a fine wire or a hook and threadthat come from the opening under the balance bowl. This allows to usethe balance as a hydrostatic balance. As there are no points of comparison, the time when AugustOertling’s long-beam precision balance No 1329 was made is unclearfor the time being. If we are to presume that the balance was madeduring Oertling’s lifetime, it could be dated to the first half of the 19 thcentury; the number most probably denotes the serial number of themanufactured devices. The article provides a short overview of the history of long-beamprecision scales, mainly on the basis of the researches of Hans R. Jenemann on this subject. Jenemann defines the age of the long-beamprecision balances with the years 1775 – 1875. The article also brieflydiscusses the achievements of the preceding age in perfecting assaybalances. The author also introduces the basics of balance theory inconnection to the possibilities of increasing the sensitivity of balances...|$|E
