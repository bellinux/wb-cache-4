40|$|Abstract – AC {{excitation}} {{followed by}} <b>synchronous</b> <b>demodulation</b> {{is an effective}} noise-reduction method for signal conditioning in modulating sensors. However, it {{cannot be applied to}} self-generating sensors such as thermocouples or piezoelectric films. Switching on and off the power supply voltage of an amplifier yields a modulated output signal and allows for <b>synchronous</b> <b>demodulation.</b> Hence, this method improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by reducing 1 /f noise and also reduces power consumption. Furthermore, it can be applied to self-generating sensors. A prototype system based on this method has been applied to a thermocouple signal conditioner whose power supply voltage was switched at 1 kHz. The nonlinearity error obtained was below 0. 01 FSR (Full Scale Range) and the SNR was 90 dB for a 1. 5 Hz noise bandwidth...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Magnetic {{levitation}} is {{a technique}} to suspend an object without any support other {{than that of a}} magnetic field. The technique finds application in various fields where friction or abrasion between metallic surfaces (like bearings) or products of friction are detrimental to the environment or to the rubbing surfaces themselves. In a simple configuration, an electromagnet is used to lift up a ferromagnetic object and the gravity pulls down the object. A stable position is expected when these two forces are equal. This is basically an unstable system. To make the system stable, a feedback signal proportional to separation between the electromagnet and the levitated object and its time derivative is required to control the current of the electromagnet. Most of the workers have used an optical sensor to obtain a signal dependent upon separation between the object and the electromagnet. An optical sensor requires additional mountings and circuitry that make the system clumsy and unreliable. To avoid the problems caused by optical sensor, an alternative method to obtain a signal depending upon separation between the magnet and the object has been presented in this paper.

Each radial AMB uses {{two pairs of}} electromagnets at {{opposite sides of the}} rotor. This allows the rotor to float in the air gap, and the machine to operate without frictional losses. In active magnetic suspension, displacement sensors are necessary to detect the radial and axial movement of the suspended object. In a high-speed rotating machine equipped with an AMB, the rotor bending modes may be limited to the operating range. The natural frequencies of the rotor can cause instability. Thus, notch filters are a useful circuit for stabilizing the system. In addition, commercial displacement sensors are sometimes not suitable for AMB design, and cannot filter the noise caused by the natural frequencies of rotor. Hence, implementing displacement sensors based on the AMB structure is necessary to eliminate noises caused by natural frequency disturbances.
