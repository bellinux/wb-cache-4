25|$|In the 1920s, the {{pioneering}} Wan brothers believed that animations <b>should</b> <b>emphasize</b> on a development style that was uniquely Chinese. This rigid philosophy {{stayed with the}} industry for decades. Animations were essentially an extension of other facets of Chinese arts and culture, drawing more contents from ancient folklores and manhua. An example of a traditional Chinese animation character would be Monkey King, a character transitioned from the classic literature Journey to the West to the 1964 animation Havoc in Heaven. Also drawing on tradition was the ink-wash animation developed by animators Te Wei and Qian Jiajun in the 1960s. Based on Chinese ink-wash painting, several films were produced in this style, starting with Where is Mama (1960). However, the technique was time-consuming and was gradually abandoned by animation studios.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the reasons}} of {{unification}} of accents in, for example, mixed diphthongs, there possibly {{is the absence}} of necessity to distinguish between them. For example, in the case of várna 'crow' - var̃nas 'raven', the r would probably usually be emphasized in var̃nas, but in a case of var̃das 'name', where there is no relative acute word, there can be no feeling for a speaker, that he / she <b>should</b> <b>emphasize</b> a sound r. But in these cases the distinction can be understood through quantity of a sound – the acute variant has lengthened a, and the circumflex – not lengthened. So, in diphthongs, the problematic leave i, u starting diphthongs, where a standard language speaker have no means to hear, directly know what type of the accent they should have (if they are stressed).|$|E
25|$|In June 1995, the Virginia Board of Education adopted Governor Allen’s Commission on Champion Schools {{recommendation}} for statewide standardized tests for academic accountability. The Board of Education {{voted in favor}} of implementing the Standards of Learning (SOLs) which measures student achievements and ensures accountability for schools in the core subjects of English, mathematics, history, economics, and science. The commission also recommended the creation of an annual ‘report card’ to grade each public school's performance stating that: “If Virginia’s youngsters can’t make the grade, then neither should their schools” (2)(9). Experts suggested that in order {{to improve the quality of}} learning, a school <b>should</b> <b>emphasize</b> academic goals and effective leadership. By using measurement through tests, the state, teachers, and parents can monitor the effectiveness of schools teaching the basic fundamental subjects (1). Allen’s legislation used public data of SOLs test scores along with school attendance and drop-out rates to ensure that unsatisfactory schools are accountable by the threat of state takeover through court action.|$|E

2500|$|Access to {{prenatal}} care, socioeconomic status, cultural influence, and postpartum breastfeeding {{support all}} influence the differing rates of breastfeeding in different ethnic groups. In the United States, {{black women are}} more likely than white women to report that they [...] "prefer bottle-feeding" [...] to breastfeeding, and they {{are also more likely to}} be low-income and unmarried and to have lower levels of education. The decision to bottle-feed rather than breastfeed is of similar importance to low birth weight in predicting infant mortality, particularly in regards to the black-white infant mortality gap. Thus, breastfeeding promotion initiatives focused on black women <b>should</b> <b>emphasize</b> education and encourage black women to prefer breastfeeding to bottle-feeding.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{argue that}} the {{organizing}} model is inappropriate {{to the task of}} unions in the modern global economy. [...] They say that industrial disputes of the type that organising engenders are harmful to the national economies in which they occur: by increasing uncertainty and raising wages (labor costs), they will make economies less attractive to inward investment. Hence, working people will suffer in the long term, as the less investment there is, the fewer jobs there will be. [...] The conclusion of those who take this line is that unions <b>should</b> <b>emphasize</b> their service aspects, particularly those that contribute toward the well-being of the employer as well as the employee. In addition, there are the criticisms leveled by the anti-union Right, who often associate collective action with the tyranny of 'Big labor', contrasted to the free operation of the capitalist labor market.|$|E

40|$|We examine two broad, {{opposite}} {{approaches that}} often guide managers in managing diversity issues. One approach, the universalist approach, emphasizes similarity {{as the basis}} of justice, as embodied in the often-heard managerial motto that fairness is maintained by treating everyone exactly the same. In contrast to this is the particularist approach, which emphasizes accommodation to cultural differences: fairness is maintained by being aware of and taking into account cultural differences in managerial decisions. We examine the problems of simplistic espousal of either of these extremes. First, we explore whether cultural differences <b>should</b> be <b>emphasized</b> as a way of understanding the causes of other people's behavior. Second, we explore whether the existence of different cultural groups <b>should</b> be <b>emphasized</b> when organizations allocate resources and rewards. And finally, we explore the extent to which cultural differences <b>should</b> be <b>emphasized</b> in managing the career development of subordinates. ...|$|R
