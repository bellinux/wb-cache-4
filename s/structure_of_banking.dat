Besides the devastating {{effects of the}} crisis on banks, expansionary policies have been revived in consequence of economic recession.

Banking markets in low-income countries {{differ from those}} in developed market economies. Banking systems in lower-income countries are typically smaller and less open. In this paper, we explore the channels through which the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>banking</b> markets affects macroeconomic volatility. Our research has three main findings. First, we study the relevance of granular effects: if the degree of market concentration in the banking sector is sufficiently high, idiosyncratic volatility at the bank-level can impact aggregate volatility. We find weak evidence for a link between granular banking sector volatility and macroeconomic fluctuations. Second, a higher share of domestic credit to GDP coincides with higher volatility in the short run. Third, {{a higher level of}} cross-border asset holdings, i. e. a higher degree of de facto financial integration, increases volatility in low-income countries...|$|E

40|$|Determining {{the optimal}} capital <b>structure</b> is one <b>of</b> the most {{fundamental}} policy decisions faced by financial managers. Since optimal debt ratio influences firm’s value, different firms determine capital structures at different levels to maximize {{the value of their}} firms. Thus, this study examines the relationship between leverage and firm specific (profitability, tangibility, growth, risk, size and liquidity) determinants <b>of</b> capital <b>structure</b> decision, and the theories <b>of</b> capital <b>structure</b> that can explain the capital <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> in Ethiopia. In order to investigate these issues a mixed method research approach is utilized, by combining documentary analysis and in-depth interviews. More specifically, the study uses twelve years (2000 - 2011) data for eight banks in Ethiopia.    The findings show that profitability, size, tangibility and liquidity <b>of</b> the <b>banks</b> are important determinants <b>of</b> capital <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> in Ethiopia. However, growth and risk <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> are found to have no statistically significant impact on the capital <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> in Ethiopia. In addition, the results of the analysis indicate that pecking order theory is pertinent theory in Ethiopian banking industry, whereas there are little evidence to support static trade-off theory and the agency cost theory. Therefore, banks should give consideration to profitability, size, liquidity and tangibility when they determine their optimum capital structure. </p...|$|R

We find that IRAP rate changes do not always lead to a change in banks’ leverage: banks close to the regulatory constraints do not change their leverage when tax rates change. This holds true for both tax cuts and tax hikes. Among less constrained entities, the leverage <b>of</b> smaller <b>banks</b> is more responsive to changes in tax rates than that <b>of</b> larger <b>banks.</b> Overall, the tax system has little effect on the capital <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks,</b> especially for larger and possibly more systemically important institutions; regulatory constraints instead seem to be a first-order determinant.
