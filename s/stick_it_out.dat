5|$|The {{settlement}} at {{the mouth}} of the Plum River was established in 1827 when copper was discovered near the Mississippi River. When the Black Hawk War erupted in 1832, the settlement at Plum River consisted of 25 people. When the settlers were informed of Black Hawk's invasion they were undecided about whether or not to abandon their homes for safer grounds in Galena, Illinois. In the end, while nearby towns such as Hanover emptied of their residents, the citizens at Plum River decided to send the women and children to Galena and leave the men to <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> on the frontier. They partially disassembled two of the settlement's homes and constructed a blockhouse for protection. Left to defend the impromptu fortifications were Aaron Pierce, Vance Davidson, Robert Upton, William Blundell, Leonard Goss and a man known as Hays. On May 19 another group of militia volunteers were ambushed at Buffalo Grove and two days later the more famous Indian Creek massacre occurred (on the same day as the raid at Plum River).|$|E
25|$|Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) visits Stan with Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) and Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White) {{as he is}} {{in desperate}} need of money. Stan forces Shirley, who he has been estranged from him the longest, to accept the money, and their angst is {{revealed}} to have started when Stan's drinking meant a young Mick and Tina went into care. Stan gives Shirley Deano's (Matt Di Angelo) mobile number, saying that he is now going by the name of Dean. A few weeks later, Shirley learns from her aunt Babe Smith (Annette Badland) that Dean has been staying with Stan. Shirley visits him, expecting to see Dean but Stan tells her that Dean went away a few days ago. A few weeks later, Mick receives news that Stan has been involved in an accident and broken his ankle. He visits him in hospital and Tina brings him to the pub, where they agree to <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> for three weeks. After Mick's wife Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) forbids Stan to smoke in the house, he secretly smokes out of the window whilst the family is out, accidentally causing a small fire when the cigarette is not stubbed out properly. He is rescued by his great-grandson Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) who {{the rest of the family}} believed was still serving in Afghanistan. It is revealed Lee has been staying with Stan for a week. After Mick believes Stan has been wetting the bed, a furious Stan demands to be taken back home. Whilst there, he is visited by Dean, who is in trouble with the law for handling stolen goods. When the police arrive, Stan takes the blame and is arrested. Mick later collects him and returns him to Walford.|$|E
500|$|The {{reaction}} in Britain to Wodehouse's broadcasts was hostile, {{and he was}} [...] "reviled... as a traitor, collaborator, Nazi propagandist, and a coward", although, Phelps observes, {{many of those who}} decried his actions had not heard the content of the programmes. A front page article in The Daily Mirror stated that Wodehouse [...] "lived luxuriously because Britain laughed with him, but when the laughter was out of his country's heart,... was not ready to share her suffering. He hadn't the guts... even to <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> in the internment camp." [...] In the House of Commons Anthony Eden, the Foreign Secretary, regretted Wodehouse's actions. Several libraries removed Wodehouse novels from their shelves.|$|E

500|$|Both my divisional {{generals and}} brigadiers have {{represented}} {{to me that}} they fear their men are thoroughly demoralised by shrapnel fire to which they have been subjected all day after exhaustion and gallant work in morning. Numbers have dribbled back from the firing line and cannot be collected in this difficult country. Even New Zealand Brigade which has only recently been engaged lost heavily and is to some extent demoralised. If troops are subjected to shellfire again tomorrow morning there {{is likely to be a}} fiasco, as I have no fresh troops with which to replace those in firing line. I know my representation is most serious, but if we are to re-embark it must be at once. Hamilton conferred with his naval commanders, who convinced him an evacuation would be almost impossible, and responded; [...] "dig yourselves right in and <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>out...</b> dig, dig, dig until you are safe". The survivors had to fight on alone until 28 April when four battalions of the Royal Naval Division were attached to the corps.|$|E
2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with both {{versions}} of the Wranglers, Phoenix-area fans largely viewed the Outlaws with indifference. For {{the second year in a}} row, attendance dropped -- from the 25,568 George Allen's Wranglers' drew the year before, to 17,881. [...] The crowds looked even smaller than that due to the spacious configuration of Sun Devil Stadium. [...] The Outlaws actually drew 4,000 fewer fans than they did in Tulsa, even though Sun Devil Stadium was almost double the size of Skelly Stadium. Despite this, the Tathams hoped to <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> once the league won their lawsuit against the NFL.|$|E

[...] Carver [...] "closed by saying in effect that not even the President could not tell the American voters on one day that the United States planned to get out of Vietnam, and on the next day tell Ho Chi Minh that we will <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> for twenty years.

2500|$|During the movie's {{production}} from June 2005 to July 2007, the filmmakers shot more than 250 hours of footage with exclusive, unprecedented access to Valentino and his entourage. [...] "We were let {{in to the}} inner circle, {{but we had to}} <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> for a long time, practically move in, to capture the truly great moments", says Tyrnauer. [...] "Valentino is surrounded by a tight-knit family of friends and employees, but, eventually, their guard came down and they forgot there was a camera crew in the room." [...] The film had its North American premiere at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival. It was released theatrically in the United States on 18 March in New York City and selected cities.|$|E
2500|$|Many African Americans, called Exodusters, {{escaped the}} Klan and racially discriminatory {{laws in the}} South by moving to large {{northern}} cities, {{as well as to}} places like Kansas where some formed all-black towns to have a greater level of freedom and autonomy. Douglass did not favor this, nor the Back-to-Africa movement, which he thought resembled the American Colonization Society he had fought in his youth. In 1892, at an Indianapolis conference convened by Bishop Henry McNeal Turner, Douglass spoke out against the separatist movements, urging blacks to <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> He made similar speeches as early as 1879, and was criticized both by fellow leaders and some audiences, who even booed him for this position. Speaking in Baltimore in 1894, Douglass said, [...] "I hope and trust all will come out right in the end, but the immediate future looks dark and troubled. I cannot shut my eyes to the ugly facts before me." ...|$|E

50|$|Reuben D'Aigle was {{the first}} to {{explicitly}} set out for the Porcupine Lake area in hopes of finding gold. D'Aigle had earlier been a latecomer to the Klondike, arriving after the initial rush but nevertheless <b>sticking</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> and eventually striking it rich along the Koyukuk River. After returning south he enrolled in a geology course at Queen's University, and used the library to pore over mining reports for new gold deposits. Discovering Parks' earlier report, he finished his course at the University and immediately set out for Porcupine.|$|R
40|$|Asia 2 ̆ 7 s {{private banking}} {{industry}} {{is expected to}} expand in the near future, and all signs point to greater competition amongst existing markets and wealth management entities. The nature of the financial service, however, remains rather interpersonal. Private bankers work almost exclusively with sophisticated, high net worth individuals. Long term survival, for them, means sticking with high value clients over the long haul, over and above <b>sticking</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> with the institutes that back those financial services.

50|$|For {{patients}} {{to benefit from}} revascularization, the surgeon's complication rate (30 day stroke and death) must remain ≤3% for asymptomatic and ≤6% of symptomatic patients. Other surgical complications include Hemorrhage of the wound bed, which is potentially life-threatening, as swelling of the neck due to hematoma could compress the trachea. Rarely, the hypoglossal nerve can be damaged during surgery. This is {{likely to result in}} fasciculations developing on the tongue and paralysis of the affected side: on <b>sticking</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> the patient's tongue will deviate toward the affected side.Another rare but potentially serious complication is hyperperfusion syndrome because of the sudden increase in perfusion of the vasculature distal to stenosis.|$|R

2500|$|Soap opera {{columnist}} Carolyn Aspenson {{stated that}} the [...] "supercouple formula" [...] should be redefined.

[...] "A super couple shouldn’t be {{designed to be a}} couple that beats the odds and <b>sticks</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> no matter what," [...] she said. [...] "We’re left with nothing on those terms. Instead, try redefining a super couple by the intensity of their love, their loss and their ability to move on without their other half. It leaves us frustrated, heartbroken and yearning for more. To me, that is the definition of a super couple." ...|$|R
