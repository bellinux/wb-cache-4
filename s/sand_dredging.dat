2500|$|Highway 1 was {{completed}} from Montara to Rockaway Beach in 1938, thereby reopening {{the local area}} again to easy northern access. [...] Horace Hill operated the quarry from the early 1940s to 1953, along with a profitable <b>sand</b> <b>dredging</b> business on the quarry's backside. [...] Ideal Cement took over the quarry operation after that time and owned it until 1971; later operators were Rhodes and Jamison and Quarry Products.|$|E
2500|$|Offshore {{areas of}} the US may contain {{resources}} of sulfur, salt, sand and gravel, phosphate rock, manganese nodules, and heavy-mineral placer deposits. [...] To date, none of these has been produced for commercial purposes except sulfur and salt in the Gulf of Mexico, and [...] in Alaskan state waters near Nome. The MMS has allowed <b>sand</b> <b>dredging</b> in federal waters to restore damaged beaches in Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, and Florida. Formerly, very large gold dredges existed for many years, mining off of Nome, Alaska. [...] The state [...] for up to the three mile limit are still held infrequently.|$|E
25|$|Supporters {{claimed that}} 2010's {{seasonal}} summer erosion {{was less than}} in prior years, although the beach was narrower after the restoration ended than in 2008. Authorities were studying whether to require the project to remove the groins immediately. Potential alternatives to geotextile tubes for moving <b>sand</b> included floating <b>dredges</b> and/or trucking in <b>sand</b> <b>dredged</b> offshore.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, an {{artificial}} beach nourishment (to prevent downdrift erosion) {{was taken up}} by placing 3.5 × 106 m3 of <b>sand</b> <b>dredged</b> from the Ennore harbour basin and the approach channel through capital dredging.|$|R
50|$|The {{species was}} {{described}} from a specimen found in <b>sand</b> <b>dredged</b> north of Unst, Shetland Islands, Scotland from {{a depth of}} 85 fathom m. It was named in honour of conchologist and malacologist John Gwyn Jeffreys.|$|R

50|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>dredging</b> {{and mining}} have been major {{businesses}} since the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>dredging</b> and dumping {{from nearby}} rivers {{can affect the}} quality of nearby surf breaks, due to changes in the amount of sand {{available}} to form over the bottom. In many sand bottom point breaks, more sand often means better quality.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} was constructed of hollow concrete blocks and <b>sand</b> <b>dredged</b> {{from the nearby}} beach setting the standard for modern construction in the region. It included sewer and irrigation systems, running ice water and was lit with carbide lamps.|$|R
50|$|High quality quartz <b>sand</b> is <b>dredged</b> {{from near}} Parengarenga Harbour.|$|R
2500|$|The {{area that}} is now the Netherlands was {{inhabited}} by early humans at least 37,000 years ago, as attested by flint tools discovered in Woerden in 2010. [...] In 2009 a fragment of a 40,000-year-old Neanderthal skull was found in <b>sand</b> <b>dredged</b> from the North Sea floor {{off the coast of}} Zeeland.|$|R
50|$|Following {{retirement}} Somerville {{moved to}} Wimbledon Ave Narrabeen where he loved {{all aspects of}} living by the lagoon - sitting beside it, walking around it and kayaking on it. His love of the lagoon led in the 1970s to fight and win against the <b>sand</b> <b>dredging</b> on Sanctuary island.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>dredging</b> {{has become}} a {{mainstay}} of local economic development {{in the last few}} years, and is an important source of revenue in the region that borders Poyang Lake. But at the same time, high-density dredging projects have been the principal cause of the death of the local wildlife population.|$|E
50|$|Hunts Bay {{is located}} on the south coast of the Gower Peninsula, Wales, between Pwll du and Foxhole to the east of Three Cliffs Bay. It was once a sandy beach, but the sand depth on the beach is diminishing, leaving a rocky cove. The loss of sand has been {{attributed}} to <b>sand</b> <b>dredging</b> in the local coastal area.|$|E
50|$|Hatteras Village was cut {{off from}} the rest of the island on September 18, 2003, when Hurricane Isabel washed a 3000 ft and 30 ft channel called Isabel Inlet at the north end of Hatteras village. The tear was {{subsequently}} repaired and restored by <b>sand</b> <b>dredged</b> by the Army Corps of Engineers.|$|R

40|$|The lancelet Brunchiostoma cnriba~um Sundcvall {{has been}} {{reported}} infrequently from the southeastcm Atlantic Coast of the United States; no study {{had been made of}} its abun-dance, distribution, or ecology on the continental shelf. Lancelets were collected with a <b>sand</b> <b>dredge</b> and Campbell grab from North Carolina to Florida. Concentrations of lancelcts were found south of Cape Hatteras. Thcrc is a 2 to 18 km wide belt that is rich in lancclets extcncling from Charleston, South Carolina, to at least Cape Kennedy, Florida. The largest numbers are off South Carolina and Georgia, where population densities reach 200 /mY (Campbell grab) or 57 /liter (<b>sand</b> <b>dredge).</b> Most speci-mcns were taken from coarse, shelly, siliceous sand. A few were occasionally collected from finer sands, but none from silt. Most were taken from depths between 10 and 30 m. INTRODUCITON Apparently the earliest record of lance...|$|R
50|$|The {{wildlife}} includes loggerhead turtles, deer, alligators, raccoons, diamondback rattlesnakes, {{and hundreds}} of species of birds. The island has an abundance of herons and egrets, as well as summertime sightings of the painted bunting. The interior lagoon (which was created by <b>sand</b> <b>dredging</b> in 1968) has become naturalized and home to such species as seahorses and barracuda.|$|E
50|$|The State Government of Maharashtra {{first took}} serious note of illegal coastal sand mining in 2004 {{following}} an incident of assault at Kihim Beach on Sumaira Abdulali (Convenor of Awaaz Foundation) by {{the son and}} employees of a local Member of the Legislative Assembly {{who are part of}} an extensive politically controlled sand mafia in Maharashtra. After that, Awaaz Foundation filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Bombay High Court seeking a ban on mining activities along the Konkan coast. Following the PIL, the court banned mining in the CRZ (coastal regulation zone) area and directed that a comprehensive report on alternatives to <b>sand</b> <b>dredging</b> prepared by Indian Institute of Technology Bombay should be implemented by the State Government. The Report includes measures to compulsorily manufacture and use artificial sand from building debris, environmental cess on natural sand and more environmentally friendly techniques of <b>sand</b> <b>dredging.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sumaira Abdulali was {{attacked}} {{a second time}} in March 2010 at Mahad while inspecting a site where illegal <b>sand</b> <b>dredging</b> is rampant. Thereafter, the Bombay High Court has completely banned all sand mining activity in the State of Maharashtra and the Government {{has been forced to}} notify a completely new Policy on sand mining after considering the IIT Bombay Report.|$|E
5000|$|Measures {{to prevent}} coastal erosion have been {{deployed}} throughout the 20th century. Concrete seawalls and groynes allowed the construction of homes and roads on the clifftops, but prevented natural supply of sand and gravel to the shore. From 1970 to 2000 over 1.5 million m³ of sand was used to replenish the beaches at Bournemouth and Poole. Many of the beaches along Poole Bay were replenished during the winters of 2005 and 2006 with 1.1 million m³ of <b>sand</b> <b>dredged</b> from Poole Harbour and 700,000 m³ of <b>sand</b> <b>dredged</b> from a Licensed Area off the Isle of Wight. [...] In 2015 a 17-year £43.7million project was approved to protect the beaches from further erosion over the next century. The plans involve replacing the groynes and adding new ones and replenishing the beaches with 210,000 cubic metres of sand and gravel every three years.|$|R
5000|$|The Reclaiming <b>Sand</b> <b>Dredge</b> was {{constructed}} for the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company in 1914 by the Bucyrus Company of South Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and designated the Calumet and Hecla Dredge Number One. [...] The dredge {{was used to}} reclaim previously-milled sand deposited in the lake after it {{had gone through the}} stamp mill. [...] The <b>dredged</b> <b>sand</b> contained copper that earlier stamping technology {{had not been able to}} separate out. [...] Improvements in stamping efficiency and cost increases in traditional shaft mining made these sand tailings economically feasible to reclaim and re-stamp.|$|R
50|$|The Gellenstrom has a {{guaranteed}} depth of 3.70 metres and {{is controlled by}} the Gellen light which marks its northern approach. The maximum speed limit is 10 kn. To the south is the port of Barhöft, which is also accessible from the Gellenstrom via the Barhöft Creek (Barhöft -Rinne). To the west is the island of Bock, which was formed from <b>sand</b> <b>dredged</b> from the channel.|$|R

50|$|Proposals {{have been}} put forward to attempt to {{alleviate}} or change the program, to attempt to restore the quality of previous surf at Kirra, however {{it is not clear}} how the improvements made to nearby Snapper and Greenmount would also be then affected. There may be an optimum amount of <b>sand</b> <b>dredging</b> and build up which allows all three breaks to be generally improved, as was perhaps the case in the early 2000s.|$|E
50|$|There {{is growing}} concern towards the coral reef and marine life due to coral mining (used for {{building}} and jewelry making), <b>sand</b> <b>dredging,</b> solid waste pollution and oil spills from boats. Mining {{of sand and}} coral has destroyed the natural coral reef that once protected several important islands, now making them highly susceptible to the erosive effects of the sea. The destruction of large coral beds due to heat is also a growing concern.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{hurricane}} passed, {{the state and}} city constructed a seawall around the settled portion of the island. Some houses were raised, and the many new ones to be constructed were built on stilts. <b>Sand</b> <b>dredged</b> from nearby waterways was pumped into the area within the seawall. In time, the elevation of the eastern portion of the island was raised {{by as much as}} 17 ft. (5.2m) ...|$|R
5000|$|The World or World Islands is an {{artificial}} archipelago of various small islands {{constructed in the}} rough shape of a world map, located {{in the waters of}} the Persian Gulf, 4.0 km off the coast of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The World islands are composed mainly of <b>sand</b> <b>dredged</b> from Dubai's shallow coastal waters, and are one of several artificial island developments in Dubai ...|$|R
50|$|Shifting sand {{bars and}} shallow waters {{have made the}} inlet treacherous for boaters to navigate, which {{prompted}} New York State to allocate $7.6 million of funding for the United States Army Corps of Engineers to dredge the inlet in 2008. In addition to improving navigational safety for vessels, the <b>sand</b> <b>dredged</b> from the inlet was pumped onto the Point Lookout shoreline to help mitigate the effects of beach erosion. The inlet was previously dredged in 1995-1996.|$|R
50|$|The 'Superbank' in Queensland is a {{world class}} surf break, partly formed from the {{influence}} of nearby <b>sand</b> <b>dredging</b> and dumping. This sand is sourced form the nearby Tweed River, which dredging program {{began in the late}} 1990s. This program has generally improved the surf quality, forming a now more or less continuous 2 km long sand bottomed surf break, linking up what was previously 3 different point breaks (Snapper, Greenmount, and Kirra) into now one more or continuous surf break, and now also one of the longest point breaks in the world.|$|E
50|$|Offshore {{areas of}} the US may contain {{resources}} of sulfur, salt, sand and gravel, phosphate rock, manganese nodules, and heavy-mineral placer deposits. To date, none of these has been produced for commercial purposes except sulfur and salt in the Gulf of Mexico, and gold in Alaskan state waters near Nome. The MMS has allowed <b>sand</b> <b>dredging</b> in federal waters to restore damaged beaches in Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, and Florida. Formerly, very large gold dredges existed for many years, mining off of Nome, Alaska. The state lease auctions for up to the three mile limit are still held infrequently.|$|E
50|$|The Trustees have {{responsibilities}} for navigational safety {{in that part}} of the estuary, and maintain a number of navigation aids (beacons, buoys and lighthouses), and a special 'Pilotwatch Radar' with portable sets for use by pilots. They also arrange the provision of pilots which are compulsory for most commercial shipping and other vessels over 30m l.o.a. in the GHT area. The main commercial traffic within the GHT area is to the port of Sharpness, and some <b>sand</b> <b>dredging.</b> The harbour, which has one of the world's highest tidal ranges, includes both the present road crossings and two riverside nuclear sites (one at Oldbury decommissioning, one at Berkeley decommissioning).|$|E
50|$|The MV Trinity Bay (formerly the Korean {{registered}} Faesco 103) is a , 80 metre long, Coastal Freighter {{owned by}} the Sea Swift shipping company based in Cairns, Australia. It runs a weekly service supplying communities on the Cape York Peninsula and in Torres Strait. Formerly a <b>Sand</b> <b>Dredge,</b> the Trinity Bay was converted into the current layout during the year 2000 in Cairns Shipyards. Even though the ship is a fully commercial cargo ship, she regularly carries 40 passengers to and from Thursday Island.|$|R
40|$|This {{propeller}} {{was built}} in 1910 by Toledo Shipbuilding Company, Toledo, Ohio. She was owned by Argo Steamship Company, Cleveland, Ohio, until 1916 when she was sold to Lake Transportation Company, Cleveland, Ohio. Bay Steamship Company, London, Great Britain, purchased her in 1916. She was then sold to French Government, Havre, France, in 1921. Interlake Steam Navigation Company, Montreal, Quebec, purchased her in 1921, before selling her to Robert S. Misener, Sarnia, Ontario, in 1923. She was sold to Kelley Island Lime and Transportation Company, Sandusky, Ohio, in 1930. In 1916, she became "Bayersher," in 1921, she became "Port De Caen" and "Bayersher," in 1923, she became "Claremont," and in 1930, she became "Geoge J. Whelan. " She underwent tonnage changes in 1916 and 1921 and was converted to a <b>sand</b> <b>dredge</b> in 1930. As "Erwin L. Fisher," she sunk in collision with steamer "S. L. Clement" on May 4, 1911 between Grassy Island and Mamajuda Light, Detroit River. She was raised by Great Lakes Towing Company and placed back into service. On her first trip as a <b>sand</b> <b>dredge,</b> she foundered six miles north of Dunkirk, New York, on July 29, 1930. Fifteen lives were lost, and six crew members were rescued by "Amasa Stone. ...|$|R
500|$|By 1937 {{official}} state publications were {{referring to the}} park as [...] "Presque Isle State Park", and that same year it led the state park system with 1.4million visitors. In the 1950s the peninsula was enlarged to accommodate new roads and parking, using [...] of <b>sand</b> <b>dredged</b> from {{the interior of the}} peninsula. The resulting basin became the current marina. Other new facilities included three modern bath houses built in 1957. That same year Gull Point (at the eastern end of the peninsula) was named a nature preserve by the state.|$|R
