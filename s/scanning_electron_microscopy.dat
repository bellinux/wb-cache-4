5|$|Spores are {{elliptical}} or oblong in shape, smooth, inamyloid, {{and have}} dimensions of 3.5–4.5 by 1.5–2.5 µm. The use of <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> {{has revealed that}} L.periphragmoides (in addition to several other Phallales species) has a hilar scar—a small indentation in {{the surface of the}} spore where it was previously connected to the basidium via the sterigma.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of <b>scanning</b> transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> for morphological observation of anodic oxide films formed on titanium {{has been successfully}} explored. Important details of anodic films are readily recorded from high quality images by <b>scanning</b> transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy,</b> which enabled {{the study of the}} film morphology, identification of film thickness and the presence of oxygen bubble features. By combining the large field of view with flexible magnification ranges in the <b>scanning</b> transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy,</b> it was possible to study the morphology of the oxide film. A 6 -specimen carousel holder would provide an increase in productivity by ∼ 20 % compared with a conventional, single-specimen <b>scanning</b> transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> or transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{continued}} {{development of}} electron probe aberration correctors for <b>scanning</b> transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> has enabled finer electron probes, allowing atomic resolution column-by-column electron energy loss spectroscopy. Finer electron probes have {{also led to}} {{a decrease in the}} probe depth of focus, facilitating optical slicing or depth sectioning of samples. The inclusion of post specimen aberration corrected image forming lenses allows for <b>scanning</b> confocal <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> with further improved depth resolution and selectivity. We show that in both <b>scanning</b> transmission <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> and <b>scanning</b> confocal <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> geometries, by performing a three dimensional raster scan through a specimen and detecting electrons scattered with a characteristic energy loss, {{it will be possible to}} determine the location of isolated impurities embedded within the bulk. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

5|$|In 1981, <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> {{revealed}} fine grooves or striations on {{the teeth}} in lemuriform toothcombs. These grooves were only {{found on the}} sides of the teeth on the concave surfaces between the sides, as well on the back ridge of the teeth. Between 10 and 20µm wide, these grooves indicate that hair moved repeatedly across the teeth. Inside these grooves were even finer grooves, less than 1µm, created by abrasion with the cuticular layer of the hair.|$|E
5|$|The spores are 4–7 by 2–3µm, oblong-elliptical, smooth, and {{embedded}} in the gleba. A 1982 study revealed that spores of species in the Phallaceae family, including Mutinus elegans, have a hilar scar (0.2–0.3µm diameter) that is observable with <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy.</b> The hilar scar is a circular indentation {{at one end of}} the spore, and it most likely results during the separation of the attachment of the spore to the sterigma of the basidium.|$|E
5|$|The ascospores {{produced}} by Polytolypa are , yellow to yellow-orange in color, with dimensions of 2.5–5 by 3–4μm. Viewed {{with a light}} microscope their surfaces appear to be smooth, but under <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy,</b> they are revealed to be densely marked with punctures and small, hard, sharp projections. The structures that produce the ascospores are called asci. In Polytolypa they are numerous, spherical, and measure 9–10 by 12–13μm. Each ascus contains eight ascospores, which are released when the ascus dissolves away at maturity. The anamorph (asexual form of the fungus) resembles the genus Chrysosporium.|$|E

5|$|Calcium oxalate is {{a common}} {{crystalline}} compound found in many fungi, including the earthstars. The presence of calcium oxalate crystals—apparent as a whitish powder {{on the surface of}} the spore sac—has been verified for G.pectinatum using <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy.</b> The calcium oxalate crystals occur in the tetragonal form, known as weddellite. A study on the related species Geastrum saccatum has shown that these crystals are responsible for the characteristic opening (dehiscence) of the outer peridial layers. The formation of calcium oxalate crystals stretches the layers of the outer walls, pushing apart the inner and outer layers of the peridium.|$|E
5|$|Examination of fruiting bodies using <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> and {{transmission}} electron microscopy has revealed details about their ultrastructure—their microscopic architecture and arrangement. For example, the hyphae of the hapteron form a dense tangled network, while the hyphae of the funicular cord are arranged in a twisted form like a rope. Further, the funicular cord, known to be highly elastic and with a high tensile strength, is made of thicker hyphae {{than the rest of}} the funiculus. Also, the ecto- and endoperidium are made of thick-walled, unbranched hyphae, known as skeletal hyphae. It has been proposed that these skeletal hyphae form a structural network that helps the fruiting body maintain the elasticity vital for proper functioning of the spore dispersal mechanism.|$|E
