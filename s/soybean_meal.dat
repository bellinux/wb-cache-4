MÉTODOS: As dietas foram preparadas a partir dos grãos dos cultivares Embrapa 48, BRS 213, BRS 155 e UFVTN 105, que receberam tratamento térmico em estufa a 130 e 150 °C, com {{posterior}} retirada ou não da casca para a produção das farinhas. Realizou-se ensaio biológico para avaliação de quociente de eficiência proteica, quociente de eficiência proteica líquida e digestibilidade verdadeira. RESULTADOS: Os valores de razão proteica líquida e digestibilidade das farinhas foram inferiores aos da caseína. As farinhas de soja com casca tratadas a 150 ºC apresentaram melhores índices de qualidade proteica que as farinhas sem casca tratadas a 130 ºC. O quociente de eficiência proteica e o quociente de eficiência proteica líquida dos cultivares Embrapa 48 e BRS 155 foram maiores (p OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the effect of processing on the protein quality of new soybean cultivars intended for human food. METHODS: The diets were prepared from the cultivars Embrapa 48, BRS 213, BRS 155 and UFVTN 105. They were heat-treated in a vacuum oven at 130 ºC and 150 °C, with subsequent removal or not of the hull for the production of <b>soybean</b> <b>meals.</b> A biological assay was done to determine the protein efficiency ratio, net protein ratio and true protein digestibility. RESULTS: <b>Soybean</b> <b>meals</b> had lower protein efficiency ratio, net protein ratio and digestibility than casein. Whole <b>soybean</b> <b>meals</b> treated at 150 ºC had a better protein quality index than refined <b>soybean</b> <b>meals</b> heat-treated at 130 ºC. The protein efficiency ratio and net protein ratio of Embrapa 48 and BRS 155 cultivars were higher (p< 0. 05) than the other ones. The UFVTN 105 cultivar had the highest digestibility (p< 0. 05) when treated at 130 ºC. Among the cultivars heat-treated at 150 ºC, the BRS 213 and BRS 155 cultivars had the lowest digestibility (p< 0. 05). Protein digestibility of the cultivar with low trypsin inhibitor content (BRS 155) was not better than that of the conventional Embrapa- 48 cultivar. CONCLUSION: Heating and removal or not of the hull affected the protein quality of the new soybean cultivars intended for human food. Whole <b>soybean</b> <b>meals</b> heat-treated at 150 ºC for 30 minutes presented the best results. Heating improved the protein quality of the conventional <b>soybean</b> <b>meals.</b> Their protein quality was similar to that of the cultivars without trypsin inhibitor and better than that of the cultivars without lipoxygenases...|$|R

In 1997, regulations prohibited the feeding of mammalian byproducts to ruminants such as cattle and goats. However, the byproducts of ruminants can still be legally fed to pets or other livestock, including pigs and poultry. In addition, it is legal for ruminants to be fed byproducts from some of these animals. Because of this, some authors have suggested that under certain conditions, it is still possible for BSE incidence to increase in U.S. cattle.
