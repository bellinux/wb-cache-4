40|$|Collated global marine {{surveys have}} {{documented}} {{large volumes of}} gaseous methane able to escape from deeply-buried deposits into global oceans as <b>seeps.</b> <b>Seeps</b> are evident where permeable faults and fracture networks allow for the upward transportation of methane from buried deposits into the water column as plumes of rising bubbles. <b>Seep</b> bubbles dissolve {{the majority of their}} constitutive methane into the surrounding water column as they rise; however there is evidence of more-prominent <b>seeps</b> transferring undissolved methane through the water column and into the atmosphere. Due to the biologic origins of methane, the global distribution of buried methane de-posits is highly varied and diﬃcult to predict. High uncertainties in <b>seep</b> locations have resulted in all previous estimations of the global proportion of atmospheric methane attributed to <b>seeps</b> to have very large associated errors. These are mainly due to large extrapolations over global oceans based on ﬁndings from surveyed <b>seep</b> ﬁelds. A 2014 NIWA research voyage saw the discovery of an abundant <b>seep</b> ﬁeld situated at uncharacteristically shallow water depths (150 – 300 m below sea level) along the raised continental shelf of the Hikurangi Margin, New Zealand. In comparison to other globally documented <b>seep</b> ﬁelds, the Hikurangi Margin <b>seeps</b> are numerous (estimated between 585 and 660 surveyed <b>seeps)</b> and cover a large area (∼ 840 km²). Prior to the discovery of this <b>seep</b> ﬁeld, there was only evidence of 36 <b>seeps</b> along the entire Hikurangi Margin. Acoustically surveyed bubble-rise paths of newly discovered <b>seeps</b> also show evidence of <b>seeps</b> extending the entire height of the water column. The large number of shallow ﬂares present in the abundant <b>seep</b> ﬁeld represent the potential for considerable amounts of gaseous methane outputs. To further investigate these <b>seeps,</b> NIWA voyages TAN 1505 and TAN 1508 that took place in June and July of 2015 employed a range of scientiﬁc equipment to analyse features of the rising <b>seep</b> bubbles. Part of these investigations involved the video recordings of rising <b>seep</b> bubbles from the seaﬂoor as well as acoustically surveying rising bubbles using a singlebeam and multibeam echsounder. We have used video and acoustic data sets to create multiple tools and computational techniques for better assessing features of <b>seeps.</b> We have developed photogrammetric tools {{that can be used in}} Matlab to compute bubble-size distributions and bubble-rise rates from still frames of underwater video footage. These bubble parameters have then been combined with singlebeam recorded ﬂare proﬁles to calculate the ﬂux of emitted methane at the seaﬂoor. These calculations were carried out using the FlareFlow Matlab module, devised by Mario Veloso. To assess the number of <b>seeps</b> in a multibeam surveyed region, we have created vertically-summed intensity maps of the obtained water column data. Summed-intensity maps display localised high-amplitude features, indicative of <b>seeps.</b> <b>Seep</b> indicators have been used to (1) map the distribution of <b>seeps</b> of the surveyed Hikurangi Margin, (2) assess the total surveyed <b>seep</b> count, and (3) identify regions where <b>seep</b> concentrations are particularly high. We have combined methane ﬂuxes from analysed <b>seeps</b> with regional seep-distribution maps to approximate the rate at which gaseous methane is escaping from the seaﬂoor across the <b>seep</b> ﬁeld. Extrapolating <b>seep</b> emissions over the surveyed area approximates 0. 99 × 10 ⁵ ± 0. 64 × 10 ⁵ m³/yr of undissolved methane is being released across the <b>seep</b> ﬁeld. Using models of methane preservation, combined with staggered depth models of ﬂares, we have approximated that ∼ 0. 2 % of the methane emitted at the seaﬂoor is able to reach the atmosphere...|$|R

There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses; as they get older, extrusions <b>seeping</b> in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides that {{have the potential to}} generate massive tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|Geyser activity, {{like all}} hot spring activity, {{is caused by}} surface water {{gradually}} <b>seeping</b> down through the ground until it meets rock heated by magma.

Geysers differ from non-eruptive hot springs in their subterranean structure; many consist of a small vent at the surface connected {{to one or more}} narrow tubes that lead to underground reservoirs of water and pressure tight rock.|$|E
40|$|Riparian zones with {{extensive}} groundwater <b>seeps</b> may allow short-circuiting of groundwater to stream channels and modify groundwater contact with shallow organic soil layers in riparian areas. The controls on {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) export to an Appalachian headwater stream were examined at Baldwin Creek (southwestern Pennsylvania), where baseflow is derived from multiple surface <b>seeps.</b> DOC inputs from near-stream <b>seeps</b> and DOC transformations along these zones and the main channel were monitored monthly over a one year period (May 2002 - 2003) using a nested sampling approach. A total of 264 <b>seep</b> samples were collected {{at the top and}} the bottom of 15 <b>seeps.</b> <b>Seep</b> samples were analyzed for DOC and nitrogen species along with streamwater and stream discharge at 7 stream stations. After discharging to the land surface at the top of <b>seeps</b> median annual DOC concentrations increased downseep by 41 %. DOC gains occurred largely in <b>seeps</b> fed by deep groundwater flowpaths, as indicated by stable temperatures and sustained discharge throughout the year, rather than in surface-water dominated <b>seeps.</b> Along the main stream channel median annual DOC concentrations were 14 % lower than <b>seep</b> bottom concentrations. DOC budgets for <b>seeps</b> and the main stream channel suggested that DOC is released by <b>seep</b> zones but retained by the main channel. During periods of high flow there was a tendency for greater DOC concentrations at the watershed outlet and greater DOC export. These data suggest that <b>seeps</b> provide a source of DOC to the main stream channel and alteration of <b>seep</b> zones or groundwater flowpaths to these zones can affect the delivery of DOC to the channel.

40|$|The role {{of methane}} {{in the global}} bio-geo-system {{is one of the}} most {{important}} issues of present-day research. Cold <b>seeps,</b> where methane leaves the seafloor and enters the water column, provide valuable evidence of subsurface methane paths. Within the New Vents project we investigate cold <b>seeps</b> and <b>seep</b> structures at the Hikurangi Margin, east of New Zealand. In the area of Opouawe Bank, offshore the southern tip of the North Island, numerous extremely active <b>seeps</b> have been discovered. High-resolution seismic sections show a variety of <b>seep</b> structures. We see seismic chimneys either characterised by high-amplitude reflections or by acoustic turbidity and faults presumably acting as fluid pathways. The bathymetric expression of the <b>seeps</b> also varies: There are <b>seeps</b> exhibiting a flat seafloor as well as a <b>seep</b> located in a depression and small mounds. The images of the 3. 5 kHz Parasound system reveal the ear-surface structure of the vent sites. While highamplitude spots within the uppermost 50 m below the seafloor (bsf) are observed at the majority of the <b>seep</b> structures, indicating gas hydrate and/or authigenic carbonate formations with an accumulation of free gas underneath, a few <b>seep</b> structures are characterised by the complete absence of reflections, indicating a high gas content without the formation of a gas trap by hydrates or carbonates. The factors controlling <b>seep</b> formation have been analysed with respect to <b>seep</b> location, <b>seep</b> structure, water depth, seafloor morphology, faults and gas hydrate distribution. The results indicate that the revailing structural control for <b>seep</b> formation at Opouawe Bank is the presence of numerous minor faults piercing the base of the gas hydrate stability zone...|$|R

Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas.

The FIM later reduced this to another probation. The event highlighted the animosity between Roberts and the FIM concerning track safety. Roberts further irritated the FIM when he began talking to the press about forming a rival racing series to compete against the FIM's monopoly.|$|E
40|$|Surface <b>seeps</b> can be defi ned as {{locations}} where upwelling ground water saturates the surface {{for most of}} the year and excess ground water can be delivered to the stream channel via surface fl owpaths. If a stream is predominantly fed by <b>seeps,</b> then ground water added to the stream via these surface fl owpaths may result in reduced interactions with the subsurface riparian zone. It is generally believed that <b>seep</b> ground water that upwells and then fl ows along surface fl owpaths can be subject to diminished denitrifi cation and biologic uptake processes. <b>Seep</b> eff ects on stream nitrate (NO 3) concentration were studied in Baldwin Creek (5. 35 km 2), southwestern Pennsylvania. Nitrate retention within <b>seep</b> zones was evaluated over a 1 -yr period (May 2002 – 2003) using a monthly, nested (top and bottom of <b>seep)</b> sampling approach along 15 individual <b>seeps.</b> <b>Seep</b> samples were analyzed for NO 3 –N, NH 3 –N, and dissolved organic carbon, along with stream waters and streamfl ow measurements at seven stream stations. <b>Seeps</b> were generally NO 3 sinks with concentrations decreasing downseep: 31 % median annual reduction and 73 % maximum monthly reduction. During cold and wet periods, <b>seeps</b> frequently behaved as NO 3 sources to the stream (NO 3 concentrations increased or remained constant downseep). <b>Seep</b> temperature and discharge were related to seasonal variability in <b>seep</b> NO 3 retention. Seasonal variations in stream NO 3 concentration have been attributed to upland soil and vegetation processes in numerous watersheds. At Baldwin Creek, <b>seep</b> NO 3 processing regulated the seasonal variability of stream NO 3 concentrations.

5|$|In Kohala, the {{numerous}} dikes near the summit inhibit groundwater from <b>seeping</b> downslope to the northeast, where it naturally wants to go.

5|$|The continual warring {{with the}} Cholas {{exhausted}} both empires, giving their subordinates {{the opportunity to}} rebel. In the decades after Vikramaditya VI's death in 1126, the empire steadily decreased in size as their powerful feudatories expanded in autonomy and territorial command. The time period between 1150 and 1200 saw many hard fought battles between the Chalukyas and their feudatories who were also at war with each other. By the time of Jagadhekamalla II, the Chalukyas had lost control of Vengi and his successor, Tailapa III, was defeated by the Kakatiya king Prola in 1149. Tailapa III was taken captive and later released bringing down {{the prestige of the}} Western Chalukyas. Seeing decadence and uncertainty <b>seeping</b> into Chalukya rule, the Hoysalas and Seunas also encroached upon the empire. Hoysala Narasimha I defeated and killed Tailapa III but was unable to overcome the Kalachuris who were vying for control of the same region.
