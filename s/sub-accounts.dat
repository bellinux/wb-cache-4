The aim of this thesis, which I called ``Purchase, processing and sales of goods in an automotive company``, is to analyze the complications connected with purchase, processing and sales of goods in the Edscha Bohemia s. r. o. automotive company. The goods are accounted according to the A-method. The purchased goods are priced with their purchase prices. When the goods are delivered from stock, weighted average method is then used. Smaller assets up to 3000 CZK is included in consumption costs. When purchasing goods, account no. 111 is not used as usually; stock account no. 112 is used instead. In my opinion, the company uses a well-designed stock-accounting system: the analytical accounts system, which {{is used by the}} company, makes the accounting process more effective. In Germany, <b>sub-accounts</b> are being used for the stocks, which makes their accounts more effective than the accounts in the Czech Republic are; they are using special <b>sub-accounts</b> for empties, compensations for defective goods, and also secondary purchase costs.

40|$|Abstract Background Implementing {{initiatives}} {{to achieve the}} targets of MDG 5 requires sufficient financial resources that are mobilized and utilized in an equitable, efficient and sustainable manner. Informed decision making to this end requires the availability of reliable health financing information. This is accomplished by means of Reproductive Health (RH) <b>sub-account,</b> which captures and organizes expenditure on RH services in two-dimensional tables from financing sources to end users. The specific objectives of this study are: (i) to quantify total expenditure on reproductive health services; and (ii) to examine the flow of RH funds from sources to end users. Methods The RH <b>sub-account</b> {{was part of the}} general National Health Accounts exercise covering the Financial Years 2007 / 08 and 2008 / 09. Primary data were collected from employers, medical aid schemes, donors and government ministries using questionnaire. Secondary data were obtained from various documents of the Namibian Government and the health financing database of the World Health Organization. Data were analyzed using a data screen designed in Microsoft Excel. Results RH expenditure per woman of reproductive age was US$ 148 and US$ 126 in the 2007 / 08 and 2008 / 09 financial years respectively. This is by far higher than what is observed in most African countries. RH expenditure constituted more than 10 - 12 % of the total expenditure on health. Out-of-pocket payment for RH was minimal (less than 4 % of the RH spending in both years). Government is the key source of RH spending. Moreover, the public sector is the main financing agent with programmatic control of RH funds and also the main provider of services. Most of the RH expenditure is spent on services of curative care (both in- and out-patient). The proportion allocated for preventive and public health services was not more than 5 % in the two financial years. Conclusion Namibia's expenditure on reproductive health is remarkable by the standards of Africa and other middle-income countries. However, an increasing maternal mortality ratio does not bode well with the level of reproductive health expenditure. It is therefore important to critically examine the state of efficiency in the allocation and use of reproductive health expenditures in order to improve health outcomes. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this appendix, {{we provide}} {{additional}} details about IMSS, including {{information on the}} 1992 pension reform, the housing <b>sub-account,</b> and the pension simulation. A. 1 1992 Pension Reform In an effort to restore financial stability to the IMSS system, the Mexican congress enacted a first attempt at pension reform in May 1992. This reform created a system of personal retirement accounts called the Sistema de Ahorro para el Retiro (SAR) to operate alongside the established PAYGO pension system. The SAR accounts were funded by employers, who contributed two percent of each worker’s wage to the worker’s SAR account. Employers deposited the contributions into a commercial bank of their own choosing; the commercial bank then transmitted the funds to the Mexican central bank. The central bank guaranteed a minimum two percent real return, and workers were supposed to receive a lump-sum payment at retirement equal to the accumulated balances. Several problems plagued {{the implementation of the}} SAR system, however. The scheme suffered from poor regulatory oversight and management. Commercial banks received low fees for administering the collection of employer contributions, weakening incentives for these banks to provide efficient record-keeping or enforce the mandatory contributions.

This is especially relevant for low-income countries facing important challenges in the area of RH. To this end, the present study analyzes public expenditure levels and trends with regards to RH in Burundi between the years 2010 to 2012, looking specifically at financing agents, health providers, and health functions. Methods: The analysis was performed using standard RH <b>sub-account</b> methodology. Information regarding public expenditures was gathered from national budgets, the Burundi Ministry of Public Health information system, and from other relevant public institutions. Results: Public RH expenditures in Burundi accounted for $ 41. 163 million international dollars in 2012, which represents an increase of 16 % from 2010. In 2012, this sum represented 0. 57 % of the national GDP. The share of total public health spending allocated to RH increased from 15 % in 2010 to 19 % in 2012. In terms of public agents involved in RH financing, the Ministry of Public Health proved to play the most important role. Half of all public RH spending went to primary health care clinics, while more than 70 % of this money was used for maternal health; average public RH spending per woman of childbearing age stagnated during the study period...|$|R

Modern foreign {{political}} and economic situation in Russia contributes {{to the development of}} inflation in our country, which has a negative impact on the financial results of business. In this case, the application of IAS 29 «Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies» is not possible because of a default specified in the standard criteria for the current situation in the Russian economy. It reduces the reliability of the financial statements. The aim of the work is to improve the methodology for the application of IAS 29 «Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies» in the current economic environment by identifying existing problems in the application of standards and their solutions. In this paper, using scientific methods of analysis, synthesis, and abstraction it is identified shortcomings in the methodology for the application of IAS 29 and the ways to overcome them. In order to improve the methodology for the application of IAS 29 «Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies» it is justified materiality level the impact of inflation, which is five per cent; developed criteria for materiality of influence.

40|$|Upon Austria's {{entry into}} Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB) took on new tasks {{in the field}} of payment systems. January 4, 1999, marked the launch of the {{cross-border}} real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system TARGET. This system, in which EU-wide some 5, 000 credit institutions participate, is composed of the national RTGS payment systems operated in the EU countries, the ECB Payment Mechanism (EPM) and an interface component called Interlinking. Austria's RTGS system, ARTIS, is integrated into TARGET. TARGET was designed as a real-time system, i. e., in normal circumstances payments reach their destination within a few seconds or minutes after being debited from the account of the sending participants, with all payments treated equally, irrespective of their value and destination. As a gross settlement system, TARGET guarantees intraday finality of payments, since transactions are settled individually. Throughout a business day, TARGET enables participating credit institutions to flexibly manage their liquidity, as they may use their minimum reserves for settlement purposes during the day. Banks may obtain unlimited intraday credit free of charge by providing adequate collateral, namely tier-one and tier-two assets. Euro 1 set up by the Euro Banking Association (EBA), Euro Access Frankfurt (EAF) and the Paris Net Settlement (PNS) system, among others, provide key alternative channels for processing payments in euro. Compared with centralised systems, TARGET with its multitude of interfaces is more susceptible to technical incidents. Even though its fees are higher, the majority of euro-denominated payments are processed via TARGET. Starting with the January 1998 reporting period, the OeNB introduced a new balance-of-payments presentation scheme. Transactions associated with the settlement of TARGET payments are recorded under "Currency and deposits" of monetary authorities (liabilities side) under the other investment <b>sub-account</b> of the financial account. In the first half of 1999, such transactions ran to ATS 66. 4 billion net. This item may not, however, be explained as an opposite position of the structural current account deficit of Austria vis-à-vis the EU 15, since TARGET transactions fall predominantly under the interbank category. The capital imported via central bank payment traffic is tantamount to borrowing by the "Austrian economy" that is basically financed at most favourable (tender rate) conditions.
