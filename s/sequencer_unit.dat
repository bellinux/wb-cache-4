50|$|The chip was {{designed}} to suit a wide variety applications and had support for external L2 cache and symmetric multiprocessing. It had four functional units, including a floating point unit, an integer unit, a branch unit and a <b>sequencer</b> <b>unit.</b> The processor also included a memory management unit. The integer pipeline was four stages long, the branch pipeline two stages long, the memory pipeline five stages long, and the floating-point pipeline six stages long.|$|E
50|$|The RSC {{operated}} at {{frequencies of}} 33 and 45 MHz. It has three execution units: a fixed point unit, floating point unit and branch processor; and an 8 KB unified instruction and data cache. Like the POWER1, the memory controller and I/O was tightly integrated, with the functional units {{responsible for the}} functions: a memory interface unit and sequencer unit; residing on the same die as the processor. The RSC contains nine functional units: fixed-point execution unit (FXU), floating-point execution unit (FPU), the memory management unit (MMU), memory interface unit (MIU), <b>sequencer</b> <b>unit,</b> common on-chip processor unit (COP), instruction fetch unit, and instruction queue and dispatch unit.|$|E
40|$|Stereo PIV {{measurements}} on a 2 - and 4 -vortex system {{have been performed}} in a large tow tank of SVA (Schiffbau-Versuchsanstalt Potsdam GmbH). The considered 4 -vortex system consists of two counter-rotating vortex pairs with a span width ratio of b 2 /b 1 = 0. 3 and a circulation ratio of Γ 2 /Γ 1 = - 0. 3. For comparisons also the corresponding 2 -vortex system is measured. A submersible Stereo PIV system attached to a vertical traversing system was employed. Cross-sectional velocity fields are obtained of the descending wake vortex system to access the vortex dynamics well into the wake far field. The SVA provided the necessary measurement equipment consisting of a submersible Stereo PIV system, a vertical traversing system and a six component force balance. DLR provided the vortex generator (F 13 model), a programmable <b>sequencer</b> <b>unit</b> enabling an adaption of the PIV recording system to the high dynamic range of the velocity fields and defined the test program of the measurement campaign...|$|E
50|$|The ALE-47 {{consists}} of a cockpit control <b>unit,</b> <b>sequencer</b> <b>units,</b> countermeasure dispensers and an optional programmer. The cockpit control unit provides an interface with the pilot. A programmer {{can be added to}} add extra features, such as advanced threat evaluation. It {{can also be used to}} fully integrate the system with an aircraft's glass cockpit eliminating the need for the cockpit control <b>unit.</b> The <b>sequencer</b> <b>units</b> control the dispensers, and are automatically capable of detecting misfires and correcting them. The sequencers are built into the dispenser units on the rotary-wing version. Each dispenser can hold five different types of countermeasures for a total of 30. The whole system can accommodate up to 32 dispensers on fixed-wing aircraft and 16 on rotary-wing aircraft.|$|R

40|$|The {{flow field}} {{characteristics}} of a two-pass cooling system with an engine-similar lay-out have been investigated experimentally using the non-intrusive Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). It consists of a trapezoidal inlet duct, a nearly rectangular outlet duct, and a sharp 180 degree turn. The system has been investigated with smooth and ribbed walls. Ribs are applied on two opposite walls in a symmetric orientation inclined with an angle of 45 degrees to the main flow direction. The configuration was analyzed with the planar two component PIV technique (2 C PIV), which is capable of obtaining complete maps of the instantaneous {{as well as the}} averaged flow field even at high levels of turbulence. In the past, slip between motor and channel rotation causes additional not negligible uncertainties during PIV measurements due to unstable image position. These were caused by the working principle of the standard programmable <b>sequencer</b> <b>unit</b> used in combination with unsteady variations of the rotation speed. Therefore, a new sequencer was developed using FPGA-based hardware and software components from National Instruments which revealed a significant increase of the stability of the image position. Furthermore, general enhancements of the operability of the PIV system were achieved. The presented investigations of the secondary flow were conducted in stationary and, with the new sequencer technique applied, in rotating mode. Especially in the bend region vortices with high local turbulence were found. The ribs also change the fluid motion as desired by generating additional vortices impinging {{the leading edge of the}} first pass. The flow is turbulent and isothermal, no buoyancy forces are active. The flow was investigated at Reynolds number of Re = 50, 000, based on the reference length d (see Fig. 3). The rotation number is Ro = 0 (non-rotating) and 0. 1. This investigation is aimed to analyze the complex flow phenomena caused by the interaction of several vortices, generated by rotation, flow turning or inclined wall ribs. The flow maps obtained with PIV are of good quality and high spatial resolution and therefore provide a test case for the development and validation of numerical flow simulation tools with special regard to prediction of flow turbulence under rotational flow regime as typical for turbomachinery. Future work will include the investigation of buoyancy effects to the rotational flow. This implicates wall heating which result from the heater glass in order to provide transparent models. ...|$|E

This system, mounted in a free-standing console cabinet, the Synthi 100 was the third development level of the original VCS3, being in essence 28 VCS3 units by circuit board count. It was driven by twelve VCOs and eight VCF oscillators.
