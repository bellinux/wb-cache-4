50|$|Space charge {{tends to}} reduce shot noise. Shot noise {{results from the}} random arrivals of {{discrete}} charge; the <b>statistical</b> <b>variation</b> in the arrivals produces shot noise. A space charge develops a potential that slows the carriers down. For example, an electron approaching a cloud of other electrons will slow down due to the repulsive force. The slowing carriers also increases the space charge density and resulting potential. In addition, the potential developed by the space charge can {{reduce the number of}} carriers emitted. When the space charge limits the current, the random arrivals of the carriers are smoothed out; the reduced variation results in less shot noise.|$|E

50|$|Statistical {{mechanics}} {{gives an}} explanation for the second law by postulating that a material is composed of atoms and molecules which are in constant motion. A particular set of positions and velocities for each particle in the system is called a microstate of the system and because of the constant motion, the system is constantly changing its microstate. Statistical mechanics postulates that, in equilibrium, each microstate that the system might be in is equally likely to occur, and when this assumption is made, it leads directly {{to the conclusion that the}} second law must hold in a statistical sense. That is, the second law will hold on average, with a <b>statistical</b> <b>variation</b> on the order of 1/√N where N is the number of particles in the system. For everyday (macroscopic) situations, the probability that the second law will be violated is practically zero. However, for systems with a small number of particles, thermodynamic parameters, including the entropy, may show significant statistical deviations from that predicted by the second law. Classical thermodynamic theory does not deal with these statistical variations.|$|E

As GEWEX was conceived projects were organized by participating factions, this task is now {{done by the}} International GEWEX Project Office (IGPO). IGPO oversees major initiatives and coordinates between national projects {{in an effort to}} bring about communication of researchers. IGPO claims to support communication exchange between 2000 scientist and is the instrument for publication of major reports. The Scientific Steering Group organizes the projects and assigns them to panels, which oversee progress and provide critique. The Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project (CEOP) the 'Hydrology Project' is a major instrument in GEWEX. [...] This panel includes geographic study areas such as the Climate Prediction Program for the Americas operated by NOAA, but also examines several types of climate zones (e.g. high altitude and semi-arid). Another panel, the GEWEX Radiation Panel oversees the coordinated use of satellites and ground based observation to better estimate energy and water fluxes.

Surface oxidation and grain boundary oxidation of a nickel-base superalloy (TAZ- 8 A) were studied at 600 to 1000 C for 10 to 1000 hours in air.
