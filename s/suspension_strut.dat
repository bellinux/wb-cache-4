50|$|The most {{advanced}} {{version of the}} system (available on vehicles with active suspension) regulates <b>suspension</b> <b>strut</b> forces according {{to the strength of}} the crosswind, thus damping the vibrations affecting the vehicle and reducing vehicle body oscillations.|$|E
50|$|Mercedes-Benz S-Class Active Body Control {{system uses}} another approach: the {{computer}} uses sensors to detect lateral load, lateral force, and height {{difference in the}} <b>suspension</b> <b>strut,</b> then uses hydraulic pressure to raise or lower the spring to counter roll. This system removes the anti-roll bar. Most active roll control systems allow a small degree of roll to give a more natural feel.|$|E
50|$|The Charmant had an {{independent}} front <b>suspension</b> (<b>struts),</b> and a live four-link rear axle. Suspension settings were soft, for maximum comfort. This setup makes the car very desirable for drifting. The car then underwent a minor facelift in autumn 1984.|$|R
40|$|The {{handling}} and braking responses {{of a heavy}} vehicle equipped with a cross-axle fluidically-coupled hydropneumatic suspension concept are investigated. The proposed fluidically-coupled suspension is conceived by diagonally interconnecting different hydraulic fluid chambers of the four <b>suspension</b> <b>struts</b> of the vehicle. The analytical formulations of suspension forces are derived based on fluid flows through the couplings and damping valves. A generalized full-vehicle model is developed and validated to evaluate the {{handling and}} braking responses to two critical vehicle maneuvers: (i) braking-in-a-turn; and (ii) split-μ straight-line braking. The responses of the vehicle model with the coupled suspension are {{compared with those of}} the uncoupled suspension under various inputs to demonstrate the potential benefits of the proposed cross-axle fluidic coupling of the <b>suspension</b> <b>struts...</b>|$|R
25|$|He {{pioneered the}} use of struts as a rear {{suspension}} device. Even today, struts used {{in the rear of}} a vehicle are known as Chapman struts, while virtually identical <b>suspension</b> <b>struts</b> for the front are known as MacPherson struts that were invented 10 years earlier in 1949.|$|R
50|$|The main {{modification}} {{that separated}} the R3 from the GTi was its double stitch welded chassis, which meant the car was welded twice for increased structural rigidity, aided by the inclusion of front and rear <b>suspension</b> <b>strut</b> braces. The R3 was also stripped of its sound-deadening material and driver's airbag, which helped bring the weight down to just 995 kg. Suspension improvements included uprated springs and dampers, thicker anti-roll bars and lower ride height.|$|E
50|$|As {{components}} of an automobile chassis, struts can be passive braces {{to reinforce the}} chassis and/or body, or active {{components of}} the suspension. An automotive <b>suspension</b> <b>strut</b> combines the primary function of a shock absorber (as a damper), {{with the ability to}} support sideways loads not along its axis of compression, somewhat similar to a sliding pillar suspension, thus eliminating the need for an upper suspension arm. This means that a strut must have a more rugged design, with mounting points near its middle for attachment of such loads.|$|E
50|$|In the ABC system, a {{computer}} detects body movement from sensors located throughout the vehicle, and controls {{the action of}} the active suspension with the use of hydraulic servomechanisms. The hydraulic pressure to the servos is supplied by a high pressure radial piston hydraulic pump. A total of 13 sensors continually monitor body movement and vehicle level and supply the ABC controller with new data every ten milliseconds. Four level sensors, one at each wheel measure the ride level of the vehicle, three accelerometers measure the vertical body acceleration, one acceleration sensor measures the longitudinal and one sensor the transverse body acceleration. At each hydraulic cylinder, a pressure sensor monitors the hydraulic pressure. As the ABC controller receives and processes data, it operates four hydraulic servos, each mounted in series on a spring strut, beside each wheel. Almost instantaneously, the servo regulated suspension generates counter forces to body lean, dive and squat during various driving maneuvers. A <b>suspension</b> <b>strut,</b> consisting of a steel coil spring and a shock absorber are connected in parallel, as well as a hydraulically controlled adjusting cylinder, are located between the vehicle body and wheel. These components adjust the cylinder {{in the direction of the}} <b>suspension</b> <b>strut,</b> and change the suspension length. This creates a force which acts on the suspension and dampening of the vehicle in the frequency range up to five hertz.|$|E
50|$|It {{has three}} lanes in each {{direction}} for vehicular traffic, with central median 0.8 meters with a rigid barrier, and side sidewalks with net width of 1.30 meters. The total width of the bridge is 30.5 meters except where the bracing section expands 32.5 meters to accommodate <b>suspension</b> <b>struts.</b>|$|R

5000|$|We can see bodies {{which are}} embellished and {{those which are}} {{repaired}} with artificial limbs and artistic <b>suspension</b> <b>struts.</b> On the other hand, bodies cannot be seen anymore. Due to epidemics like ebola or multiple resistant germs they are forced into protective gears, for not paying with their own lives when helping the ill.|$|R
5000|$|As {{opposed to}} the road going Cayman GT4, the Clubsport version is fitted with Porsche's PDK double clutch {{transmission}} (albeit with 7th gear disabled) with shift paddles on the steering wheel, as well as mechanical rear-axle locking differential. The Cayman GT4 Clubsport weighs only 1,300 kg and shares the same Performance Friction brakes and lightweight <b>suspension</b> <b>strut</b> front axle found on the Porsche 991 GT3 Cup. Its ABS is adjustable in 12 steps. A 100-litre FIA-approved [...] "bag" [...] fuel tank is available as an option for endurance racing. In addition to its lightweight features, it is supplied fitted with an FIA welded-in roll-cage, six-point harness and a racing bucket seat.|$|E
50|$|The Stagea was {{available}} in 2WD (RWD) and AWD variants, with the RWD variants using RWD Laurel front <b>suspension</b> (<b>strut</b> type) and AWD versions using RWD r34 Skyline (multiple link) front suspension. Both RWD and AWD shared its chassis platform with the C35 Laurel, which had the same wheelbase of 2720mm, and was also available in RWD and AWD. The chassis between 2WD and AWD did have some differences, the main being that the driver's side chassis rail on the AWD version was positioned closer to the lower sill. This was done {{to make room for}} the transfer case located on the end of the AWD transmission.|$|E
50|$|Nissan {{released}} the A31 series Cefiro sedan to Japan in September 1988. It shared its transmission, engine and rear suspension setup with the R32 Skyline, F31 Leopard, and C33 Laurel {{with the exception}} of the diesel engine which was available only in the Laurel. The chassis platform and front <b>suspension</b> (<b>strut</b> type) was shared with the Laurel with the one exception of the 4wd Cefiro, which used the Skyline GTS4 front suspension (multiple link type) and front drive train. The chassis was shared with the Laurel only, as it had a slightly longer wheelbase than the Skyline chassis. It was also one of the first Japanese production vehicles to be equipped with a 5 speed automatic transmission, which was available in the 2.5L non turbo.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to coarse and fine threads, {{there is another}} division of extra fine, or “superfine” threads, with a very fine pitch thread. Superfine pitch metric threads are occasionally used in automotive components, such as <b>suspension</b> <b>struts,</b> and are commonly used in the aviation manufacturing industry. This is because extra fine threads are more resistant to coming loose from vibrations.|$|R
50|$|This bridge has {{elaborate}} <b>suspension</b> <b>struts</b> {{in comparison}} with most other suspension bridges, and is the third bridge {{to be built in}} Singapore. It was constructed in 1869 to allay the inconvenience of crossing the Singapore River by boat. It was originally designed as a drawbridge but on its completion was found to be suitable only as a fixed structure. Numerous steel rivets were used in its construction, which employed steel casting methods commonly used during that era.|$|R
2500|$|Aluminium engine cradles and <b>suspension</b> <b>struts</b> for {{stretched}} Lincoln Town Car {{were the}} first automotive parts that were friction stir at Tower Automotive, who use the process also for the engine tunnel of the Ford GT. A spin-off of this company is called Friction Stir Link, Inc. and successfully exploits the FSW process, e.g. for the flatbed trailer [...] "Revolution" [...] of Fontaine Trailers. In Japan FSW is applied to <b>suspension</b> <b>struts</b> at Showa Denko and for joining of aluminium sheets to galvanized steel brackets for the boot (trunk) lid of the Mazda MX-5. Friction stir spot welding is successfully used for the bonnet (hood) and rear doors of the Mazda RX-8 and the boot lid of the Toyota Prius. Wheels are friction stir welded at Simmons Wheels, UT Alloy Works and Fundo. Rear seats for the Volvo V70 are friction stir welded at Sapa, HVAC pistons at Halla Climate Control and exhaust gas recirculation coolers at Pierburg. Tailor welded blanks are friction stir welded for the Audi R8 at Riftec. The B-column of the Audi R8 Spider is friction stir welded from two extrusions at Hammerer Aluminium Industries in Austria.|$|R
50|$|MX-5 1.8i Miyako and 2.0i Miyako {{are limited}} (500 units each) {{versions}} of the MX-5 soft-top convertible with MZR 1.8L engine, and the powered retractable hardtop with MZR 2.0L engine respectively for UK market, commemorating 20 years of MX-5. The Miyako package included Medici premium perforated black leather trim with a red underlay and stitching, special badging, floor mats and climate control air-conditioning. The exterior includes front fog lamps, larger 17-inch alloy wheels, a front <b>suspension</b> <b>strut</b> brace, and free metallic paint with Aluminium Silver Metallic option (and Velocity Red Mica on 1.8i Miyako). Both Miyako models also included remote central locking, a leather steering wheel with audio controls, an MP3 compatible audio system with six speakers and auxiliary (AUX) jack input, heated electric mirrors and electric front windows, a Thatcham Category 1 alarm and immobiliser. 2.0i Miyako also included Limited Slip Differential, Dynamic Stability Control, Traction Control System.|$|E
50|$|The whole high {{pressure}} {{part of the system}} is manufactured from steel tubing of small diameter, connected to valve control units by Lockheed type pipe unions with special seals made from desmopan rubber, a type of rubber compatible with the LHM fluid. The moving parts of the system (e.g., <b>suspension</b> <b>strut</b> or steering ram) are sealed by contact seals between the cylinder and piston for tightness under pressure. The other plastic/rubber parts are return tubes from valves such as the brake control or height corrector valves, also catching seeping fluid around the suspension push-rods. Height corrector, brake master valve and steering valve spools, and hydraulic pump pistons have extremely small clearances (1-3 micrometres) with their cylinders, permitting only a very low leakage rate. The metal and alloy parts of the system rarely fail even after excessively high mileages but the rubber components (especially those exposed to the air) can harden and leak, typical failure points for the system.|$|E
5000|$|Petrov {{was linked}} to joining Sauber, Renault F1 and Campos for the [...] season. He was {{announced}} as a Renault driver on 31 January and thus he has become the first Russian driver in the Formula One World Championship (Igor Troubetzkoy raced a Ferrari Formula One car in 1948). He was signed for a one-year deal, with an option for a further two. He {{was very close to}} signing for Campos but he felt Renault was the best option for him. He also mentioned that he had no major sponsors from Russia backing him just his dad and some of his friends. Petrov stated that his goal is to start scoring points by mid-season. His teammate for his debut season was Robert Kubica, who like Petrov - who stands at 185 cm tall - is one of the tallest drivers on the grid. After qualifying seventeenth, Petrov's first race ended prematurely when the team found his right-front <b>suspension</b> <b>strut</b> to be damaged, which the Russian suspected to have been caused by hitting a kerb too hard. He had been chasing Rubens Barrichello for tenth place and a World Championship point {{at the time of the}} incident.|$|E
50|$|It {{was based}} on the Mercedes Benz S 600 L Guard, but in {{limousine}} form with an extra-long wheelbase. It includes a rear entrance with increased headroom, 4 seats behind driver partition. Other features included reinforcement of the links between the suspension components and the bodyshell, specifically targeted modification of the suspension components themselves, an additional brace (strut tower brace) between the front <b>suspension</b> <b>struts,</b> two additional steel springs at the rear to complement the air suspension, larger twin-calliper front brake discs.|$|R

40|$|Open AccessThis paper {{proposes a}} novel inerter-based {{electromagnetic}} device and investigates its {{performance as a}} vehicle <b>suspension</b> <b>strut.</b> The inerter-based electromagnetic device is obtained by placing the flywheel employed in an existing inerter prototype into a constant magnetic field. During rotation of the flywheel, the flywheel is doing the magnetic line cutting motion, which makes the flywheel perform as a Faraday generator. The influences {{of different types of}} loads on the behaviour of the inerter-based electromagnetic device are analyzed, and it is shown that the resistive, capacitive and inductive loads can contribute to the damping, the inertance, and the stiffness of the whole device, respectively. Moreover, the proposed device {{can also be used to}} realize higher-order mechanical admittances by using electrical circuits. The performance of the device as a <b>suspension</b> <b>strut</b> is also studied. Numerical simulations show that the proposed device can not only provide improvements on the suspension performance (ride comfort and road holding) compared with the conventional strut, but also generate an amount of electric energy that can be utilized by other parts of the vehicle. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—To {{improve the}} {{dynamics}} {{response of the}} vehicle passive suspension, a two-terminal mass is suggested to connect in parallel with the <b>suspension</b> <b>strut.</b> Three performance criteria, tire grip, ride comfort and suspension deflection, are taken into consideration to optimize the suspension parameters. However, the three criteria are conflicting and non-commensurable. For this reason, the Chebyshev goal programming method is applied {{to find the best}} tradeoff among the three objectives. A simulation case is presented to describe the multi-objective optimization procedure. For comparison, the Chebyshev method is also employed to optimize the design of a conventional passive suspension. The effectiveness of the proposed design method has been clearly demonstrated by the result. It is also shown that the suspension with a two-terminal mass in parallel has better performance in terms of the three objectives.

40|$|A new ideal {{mechanical}} {{one-port network}} element named the inerter was recently introduced, and {{shown to be}} realisable, with the property that the applied force {{is proportional to the}} relative acceleration across the element. This paper makes a comparative study of several simple passive suspension struts, each containing at most one damper and inerter as a preliminary investigation into the potential performance advantages of the element. Improved performance for several different measures in a quarter-car model is demonstrated here in comparison with a conventional passive <b>suspension</b> <b>strut.</b> A study of a full-car model is also undertaken where performance improvements are also shown in comparison to conventional passive suspension struts. A prototype inerter has been built and tested. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate a characteristic phase advance property which cannot be achieved with conventional passive struts consisting of springs and dampers only.

40|$|The {{influences}} of fluidic X-coupling of hydro-pneumatic <b>suspension</b> <b>struts</b> {{on the various}} suspension properties are investigated for a sport utility vehicle (SUV). The stiffness and damping properties in the bounce, pitch, roll and warp modes are particularly addressed together with the couplings between the roll, pitch, bounce and warp modes of the vehicle. The proposed X-coupled suspension configuration involves diagonal hydraulic couplings among the different chambers of the four hydro-pneumatic struts. The static and dynamic forces developed by the struts of the unconnected and X-coupled suspensions are formulated using a simple generalized model, which are subsequently used to derive the stiffness and damping properties. The properties of the X-coupled suspension are {{compared with those of}} the unconnected suspension configuration, in terms of four fundamental vibration modes, namely bounce, roll, pitch and warp, to illustrate the significant effects of fluidic couplings. The results suggest that the X-coupling could help achieve greater roll and pitch stiffness and damping, with negligible effects on the bounce and warp mode properties. It is further shown that the X-coupled struts offer greater design flexibility to achieve better compromise among different conflicting measures. From the results, it was concluded that the proposed X-coupling of the <b>suspension</b> <b>struts</b> could help achieve improved roll stability, handling and pitch control, without sacrificing the bounce ride quality and road-holding performance of SUVs during both the on- and off-road driving conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of synthesis of (passive) mechanical one-port networks. One of the main contributions of this paper is the introduction of a device, which will be called the inerter, which is the true network dual of the spring. This contrasts with the mass element which, by definition, always has one terminal connected to ground. The inerter allows electrical circuits to be translated over to mechanical ones in a completely analogous way. The inerter need not have large mass. This allows any arbitrary positive-real impedance to be synthesized mechanically using physical components which may be assumed to have small mass compared to other structures to which they may be attached. The possible application of the inerter is considered to a vibration absorption problem, a <b>suspension</b> <b>strut</b> design, and as a simulated mass.
