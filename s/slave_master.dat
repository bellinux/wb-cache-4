500|$|Manohla Dargis wrote, in her {{review for}} The New York Times, [...] "the genius of 12 Years a Slave is its insistence on banal evil, and on terror, that seeped into souls, bound bodies and reaped an enduring, terrible price".

500|$|Marriages {{between white}} {{plantation}} owners and African women were common in East Florida. The Spanish government provided {{for a separate}} class of free people of color, and encouraged slaves to purchase their freedom. Slavery under Spain in Florida was not considered a lifelong condition, and free blacks {{were involved in the}} economic development of the region, many of them owning their own slaves. Anna oversaw 60 slaves at Fort George Island which grew [...] sea island cotton, citrus, corn, sugarcane, beans, and potatoes. John Maxwell, the fourth child, was born in 1824 when Kingsley and Anna lived on Fort George Island. Kingsley also maintained relationships with three other African women who acted as co-wives or concubines: Flora H., Sarah M.; and Munsilna McGundo. Anna Jai remained the matriarch in the polygamous family. Historian Daniel Schafer posits that Anna Jai would have been familiar with the concepts of polygamy and marrying a <b>slave</b> <b>master</b> to acquire one's freedom. [...] Visitors to the plantation were invited to a dinner table where Kingsley displayed his multi-racial children with pride. [...] He provided them with the best education he could afford, and considered them a shield from any potential racial uprising.|$|E
500|$|Critic William Sylvester {{states that}} the metaphors in Angelou's poetry serve as [...] "coding", or litotes, for {{meanings}} understood by other Blacks. [...] In her poem [...] "Sepia Fashion Show", for example, the last lines ("I'd remind them please, look at those knees / you got a Miss Ann's scrubbing") is a reference to slavery, when Black women had to show their knees to prove how hard they had cleaned. [...] Sylvester states that this is true in much of Angelou's poetry, and that it elicits {{a change in the}} reader's emotions; in this poem, from humor to anger. [...] Sylvester says that Angelou uses the same technique in [...] "Letter to an Aspiring Junkie", in which understatement contained in the repeated phrase [...] "nothing happens" [...] is a litotes for the prevalence of violence in society. [...] Hagen connects this poem with the final scene in her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name, which describes her encounter with her friend, a drug addict who shows her the effects of his drug habit. [...] According to Hagen, the poem is full of disturbing images, such as drugs being a <b>slave</b> <b>master</b> and the junkie being tied to his habit like a monkey attached to the street vendor's strap.|$|E

50|$|As slaves, {{black men}} and women had no rights. By law, they were {{considered}} property and their white <b>slave</b> <b>masters</b> treated them as such. An example of their treatment was how white <b>slave</b> <b>masters</b> bought and sold slaves as commodity items, ripping families apart in the process. Another example of the treatment of slaves in America was the abuse and violence that they experienced. In order for <b>slave</b> <b>masters</b> to maintain power and control of their slaves, they repeatedly beat and abused them. This violence was used as a form of social control and also served to maintain white supremacy. The violence that female slave experienced differed from male slaves.|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{references}} to the [...] "laws of war", or [...] "traditions of war" [...] was by Cicero, who urged soldiers to observe the rules of war, since obeying the regulations separated the [...] "men" [...] from the [...] "brutes". Conquering the riches and property of an enemy was regarded as legitimate reason for war in itself. Women were included with [...] "property", since they were considered under the lawful ownership of a man, whether a father, husband, <b>slave</b> <b>master,</b> or guardian. In this context, the rape of a woman was considered a property crime committed against the man who owned the woman.|$|E
2500|$|Slaveholders {{began to}} think that slavery was {{grounded}} in the Bible. This view was inspired in part by a reinterpretation of the Genesis passage [...] "Cursed be Canaan; The lowest of slaves Shall he be to his brothers" [...] (Genesis 9); Ham, son of Noah and father of Canaan, was deemed the antediluvian progenitor of the African people. Some whites used the Bible to justify the economic use of slave labor. Subjugation of slaves was taken as a natural right of the white slave owners. The second class position of the slave was not limited to his relationship with the <b>slave</b> <b>master,</b> but was to be in relation to all whites. Slaves were considered subject to white persons.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Mulatto" [...] is a melodrama {{with the}} gothic {{elements}} of curses, suicide, murder, and the monstrous.

Melodrama in a domestic setting was particularly transferrable to interracial questions of family legitimacy:"Dramas of patriarchal right, and hyperbolic investments in moral polarities of good and evil, virtue and villainy, are about investing the family with new symbolic potency ... In the context of Saint-Domingue and Louisiana, and in 'Le Mulâtre,' the symbolic crisis of the Law of the Father and of social legitimacy is lived literally and viscerally. The colonial family romance here really means killing the father, as the conflict between slave and <b>slave</b> <b>master</b> is, so often, a family drama too." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese scholar Hidetada Mukai wrote Austen {{never gave}} the precise {{wealth of the}} Bertram family, but it is {{mentioned}} that Mr. Rushworth has an annual income of £12,000 and the Bertrams live on less than that. Hidetda noted that Mansfield Park is described in the novel as a modern house, and Sir Thomas wants Maria to marry Mr. Rushworth to improve the social prestige of his family, suggesting that the Bertrams are a nouveau riche family whose income depends on the plantation in Antigua. The abolition {{of the slave trade}} in 1807 did indeed, as the abolitionists had hoped, impose serious strain on the plantations of the British West Indies as without new slaves from Africa to replace the ones who had died of yellow fever and malaria, it become more difficult to turn a profit owing to labour shortages, and Austen may have been referring to this crisis on the Caribbean plantations when Sir Thomas leaves for Antigua for two years to deal with unspecified problems on his plantation. Hidetada pointed that when Sir Thomas returns after his two-year absence in Antigua, none of his children are happy to see him again, suggesting that Sir Thomas is an oppressive father, and that Austen made him a <b>slave</b> <b>master</b> with his plantation in Antigua as an way of indicating that. Hidetada further argued that Austen made Sir Thomas a <b>slave</b> <b>master</b> as an feminist attack on the patriarchal society of Regency England, noting that the way in which Sir Thomas treats woman, including his own daughters and as well as Price, as disposable commodities to be traded and bartered for to his own advantage is parallel with his treatment of his slaves who are exploited to support his lifestyle. Hidetada also noted that Sir Thomas talks much about his time in the West Indies, but when Price asks him about his slaves, she is greeted with [...] "dead silence", suggesting Sir Thomas cannot speak of something that he knows in his heart to be wrong.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{no limit}} {{on the number of}} concubines a master may possess. However, the general marital laws are to be observed, such as not having sexual {{relations}} with the sister of a female slave. In Islam, [...] "men are enjoined to marry free women in the first instance, but if they cannot afford the bridewealth for free women, they are told to marry slave women rather than engage in wrongful acts." [...] One rationale given for recognition of concubinage in Islam is that [...] "it satisfied the sexual desire of the female slaves and thereby prevented the spread of immorality in the Muslim community." [...] A <b>slave</b> <b>master</b> could have sex with his female slave only while she was not married. This attempt to require sexual exclusivity for female slaves was rare in antiquity, when female slaves generally had no claim to an exclusive sexual relationship. According to Sikainga, [...] "in reality, however, female slaves in many Muslim societies were prey for members of their owners' household, their neighbors, and their guests." ...|$|E

2500|$|After being {{admitted}} to the bar, Dershowitz served as a clerk for David L. Bazelon, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

2500|$|Ornamental names used as {{surnames}} {{are more}} common in communities which adopted (or were forced to adopt) surnames in the 18th and 19th centuries. They occur commonly among Jewish families, Germany, and in Scandinavia. Examples include [...] "Morgenstern" [...] ("morning star"), [...] "Safire" [...] ("sapphire"), and [...] "Reis" [...] ("branch"). In some cases, such as Chinese Indonesians and Chinese Thais, certain ethnic groups are subject to political pressure to change their surnames, in which case surnames can lose their family-name meaning. For instance, Indonesian business tycoon Liem Swie Liong (林绍良) [...] "indonesianised" [...] his name to Sudono Salim. In this case [...] "Liem" [...] (林) was rendered by [...] "Salim", a name of Arabic origin, while [...] "Sudono", a Javanese name with the honorific prefix [...] "su-" [...] (of Sanskrit origin), {{was supposed to be}} a rendering of [...] "Swie Liong". [...] During the era of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade (of Africans) many Africans lost their native names and were forced to take the surnames of their slave masters and any given name the <b>slave</b> <b>master</b> desired. In the Americas, the family names of many African-Americans have their origins in slavery (i.e. slave name). Many of them came to bear the surnames of their former owners.

The wealth embezzled and extracted by him was infused into the famed Yale University, an Ivy League university in USA. Only two decades later, in 1677, when Shivaji captured Gingee, the fort fell into the hands of the Marathas. In 1690, the British East India Company purchased the fort and the adjacent villages (within [...] "ye randome shott of a piece of ordnance".) A great gun was fired to different points of the compass and all the country within its range, including the town of Cuddalore, passed into the possession of the English. The villages thus obtained are called [...] "cannon ball villages". The fortifications were strengthened in 1693, 1698, 1702, 1725, 1740 and 1745. In 1746 Fort St. David became the British headquarters for British India. The British ruled a greater part of south India (Tamil Nadu, parts of present-day Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka) from Fort St. David. An attack by Dupleix was successfully repulsed. In 1756, Clive was appointed governor. The French captured the fort in 1758 but in 1760 relinquished it to Sir Eyre Coote of the British East India Company. The French recaptured the fort in 1782 and held it in 1783 during the Battle of Cuddalore. In 1785 the fort passed into British possession.
