40|$|We {{investigate}} numerically {{the use of}} a negative-permeability "perfect lens" {{for enhancing}} wireless power transfer between two current carrying coils. The negative permeability slab serves to focus the flux generated in the <b>source</b> <b>coil</b> to the receiver coil, thereby increasing the mutual inductive coupling between the coils. The numerical model is compared with an analytical theory that treats the coils as point dipoles separated by an infinite planar layer of magnetic material [Urzhumov et al., Phys. Rev.

Both the idealized analytical and realistic numerical models predict similar trends with respect to metamaterial loss and anisotropy. Applying the numerical models, we further analyze the impact of finite coil size and finite width of the slab. We find that, even for these less idealized geometries, the presence of the magnetic slab greatly enhances the coupling between the two coils, including cases where significant loss is present in the slab. We therefore conclude that the integration of a metamaterial slab into a wireless power transfer system holds promise for increasing the overall system performance...|$|E

The groove can be on the internal or external wall of the tube. The problem is axially symmetric and easily solved using numerical methods however, we seek an accurate semi‐analytical solution. Take the axis of the system to be perpendicular to two truncation planes with the groove bisected by a mid plane halfway between them. Boundary conditions are applied on the truncation planes where we suppose that the tangential electric field is zero. In order to ensure that the predicted field is close to that expected in the corresponding unbounded domain problem, the truncation planes are far apart, well away from the coil and the groove. The solution is expressed as series expansions for different regions that are matched across cylindrical boundaries using the continuity properties of the electromagnetic field. This process gives the expansion coefficients in the series in terms of the expansion coefficients that represent the field of the <b>source</b> <b>coil.</b> From the solutions, the coil signal due to the groove can be deduced.

40|$|Abstract—Eddy-current {{non-destructive}} testing {{is widely used}} to detect defects within a metal structure. It is also useful to characterize their location and shape provided that proper maps of variations of impedance which the defects induce are available. Imaging of void defects in {{the wall of a}} hollow, non-magnetic metal tube, is performed herein by controlled evolution of level sets. Such data are variations of impedance collected by a circular probe array close to the inner surface of the tube when a <b>coil</b> <b>source</b> operated at one single frequency is set along its axis at some distance from the array, both receiver and <b>coil</b> <b>source</b> being moved simultaneously. The defect zone is represented in implicit fashion as a zero level set, amenable to topological changes via a nonlinear iterative method that minimizes a least-square cost functional made of the difference between the measured (computer simulated) and model data. The procedure involves the rigorous calculation of the gradient of the variations of impedance, {{in the case of a}} multi-static configuration (driver and receiver coils are different), a vector domain integral field formulation being used to that effect.
