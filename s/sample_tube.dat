25|$|Pyrolysis is {{the thermal}} {{decomposition}} of materials in an inert atmosphere or a vacuum. The sample {{is put into}} direct contact with a platinum wire, or placed in a quartz <b>sample</b> <b>tube,</b> and rapidly heated to 600–1000°C.

Three different heating techniques are used in actual pyrolyzers: Isothermal furnace, inductive heating (Curie Point filament), and resistive heating using platinum filaments.

40|$|An Outer Planets Probe which {{retains the}} charred {{heatshield}} during atmospheric descent must deploy a <b>sampling</b> <b>tube</b> through the heatshield to extract atmospheric samples for analysis. Once the <b>sampling</b> <b>tube</b> is deployed, the atmospheric samples ingested must {{be free of}} contaminant gases generated by the heatshield. Outgassing products such as methane and water vapor are present in planetary atmospheres and hence, ingestion of such species would result in gas analyzer measurement uncertainties. This paper evaluates the potential for, and design impact of, the extracted atmospheric samples being contaminated by heatshield outgassing products. Flight trajectory data for Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus entries are analyzed to define the conditions resulting in the greatest potential for outgassing products being ingested into the probe's sampling system. An experimental program is defined and described which simulates the key flow field features for a planetary flight in a ground-based test facility. The primary parameters varied in the test include: <b>sampling</b> <b>tube</b> length, injectant mass flow rate and angle of attack.

The online monitoring of the filling process ensures that no bubbles or particles obstruct the measurement. A picture can be saved together with the recorded data.
