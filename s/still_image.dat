In their place, the game displays a <b>still</b> <b>image</b> of a statue holding its face in its hand, with an explicit description of events {{depicted in the}} scene. In Australia, the same scenes were removed because the Australian Classification Board refused to rate the game for release due to the depiction of sexual violencespecifically the child player-character being subjected to anal probing and the interactive abortion scene. Like the European version, these scenes were replaced with a placeholder card with an explanation of what was removed on a background image of a koala crying.|$|E
5|$|To provide {{realistic}} bodies while {{preventing the}} corpses from moving, {{after a lengthy}} casting process the crew chose extras who could lie as still as possible. For the bath house owner Tsuyako Yamashita, this was not possible owing {{to the need to}} see her alive first, and a search for a body double was unfruitful. Ultimately, the crew used digital effects to transplant a <b>still</b> <b>image</b> of the actor during the character's funeral scene, allowing for a realistic effect.|$|E
5|$|Although {{nearly the}} entire DuMont film archive was destroyed, several {{surviving}} DuMont shows have been released on DVD. A large number of episodes of Life Is Worth Living have been saved, and they are now aired weekly on Catholic-oriented cable network, the Eternal Word Television Network, which also makes a collection of them available on DVD (in the biographical information about Fulton J. Sheen added {{to the end of}} many episodes, a <b>still</b> <b>image</b> of Bishop Sheen looking into a DuMont Television camera can be seen). Several companies that distribute DVDs over the Internet have released a small number of episodes of Cavalcade of Stars and The Morey Amsterdam Show. Two more DuMont programs, Captain Video and His Video Rangers and Rocky King, Inside Detective, have had a small amount of surviving episodes released commercially by at least one major distributor of public domain programming.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective It is {{generally}} assumed that motion in motion images {{is responsible for}} increased postural sway {{as well as for}} visually induced motion sickness (VIMS). However, this has not yet been tested. To that end, we studied postural sway and VIMS induced by motion and <b>still</b> <b>images.</b> Method 15 Participants were exposed to motion- and <b>still</b> <b>images</b> in separate sessions. Motion images consisted of video clips taken from a first person shooter game. <b>Still</b> <b>images</b> consisted of <b>stills</b> taken every 10 s from these same clips. Before, during, and after exposure, VIMS was rated and postural sway was measured. Sway path length, standard deviation and short- and long-term scaling components of the centre of pressure were calculated as measures of postural sway. Results VIMS scores obtained during and after exposure to motion images were significantly higher compared to scores obtained before, and directly after exposure to <b>still</b> <b>images.</b> The sway path length, standard deviation in anteroposterior direction and short-term scaling components in mediolateral and anteroposterior direction increased significantly during exposure to motion and <b>still</b> <b>images.</b> Conclusion In this experiment motion- and <b>still</b> <b>images</b> caused different levels of VIMS, but comparable increases in postural sway. We assume VIMS was caused by a mismatch between visual and vestibular motion cues. The increase in sway during exposure to <b>still</b> <b>images</b> can be explained by visual effects present in <b>still</b> <b>images.</b> The lack of vection in the motion images may explain why sway was not larger when viewing these motion images as compared to viewing the <b>still</b> <b>images.</b> © 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|Object {{detectors}} {{are typically}} trained {{on a large}} set of <b>still</b> <b>images</b> annotated by bounding-boxes. This paper intro-duces an approach for learning object detectors from real-world web videos known only to contain objects of a target class. We propose a fully automatic pipeline that localizes objects {{in a set of}} videos of the class and learns a detec-tor for it. The approach extracts candidate spatio-temporal tubes based on motion segmentation and then selects one tube per video jointly over all videos. To compare to the state of the art, we test our detector on <b>still</b> <b>images,</b> i. e., Pascal VOC 2007. We observe that frames extracted from web videos can differ significantly in terms of quality to <b>still</b> <b>images</b> taken by a good camera. Thus, we formulate the learning from videos as a domain adaptation task. We show that training from a combination of weakly annotated videos and fully annotated <b>still</b> <b>images</b> using domain adap-tation improves the performance of a detector trained from <b>still</b> <b>images</b> alone. 1...|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} Macintosh {{version of}} Myst {{was constructed in}} HyperCard. Each Age was a unique HyperCard stack. Navigation was handled by the internal button system and HyperTalk scripts, with image and QuickTime movie display passed off to various plugins; essentially, Myst functions {{as a series of}} separate multimedia slides linked together by commands. As the main technical constraint that impacted Myst was slow CD-ROM drive read speeds, Cyan had to {{go to great lengths to}} make sure all the game elements loaded as quickly as possible. Images were stored as 8-bit PICT resources with custom color palettes and QuickTime <b>still</b> <b>image</b> compression. Animated elements such as movies and object animations were encoded as QuickTime movies with Cinepak compression; in total, there were more than 66minutes of Quicktime animation. This careful processing made the finished graphics look like truecolor images despite their low bit depth; the stills were reduced in size from 500kB to around 80kB.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a <b>still</b> <b>image</b> {{of a woman in}} her bikini (Manuela Arbeláez) while various scenery backdrops are {{superimposed}} in the background. The first scenes of the video flicker between Diddy’s life with his femme fatale and Diddy singing with the rest of Dirty Money in the bedroom of a mansion. Some of the possessions in the house such as picture frames shatter as the chorus builds up. However, during Dawn Richard and Kalenna Harper’s verses, the camera focus on Richard and Harper singing directly into the camera lens. As Drake’s verse begins, Diddy falls backwards into a swimming pool in slow motion, while the camera image slowly fades into a club scene. There is a brief shot of a bottle of coconut-flavored Cîroc vodka before Diddy is scene mingling in the club. The camera mainly focus on Drake, who is observing what is happening and rapping his verse. During the bridge, Richard and Harper appear in the club and Diddy’s femme fatale is seen in the background.|$|E

50|$|Another major metaphor in {{the film}} {{is the use of}} <b>still</b> <b>images.</b> The lack of moving footage is Ruiz's way of {{deconstructing}} performance, while making a critique on conventional melodramas. The repetition of these <b>still</b> <b>images</b> demonstrates the entrapment of the characters in their unfortunate existences. They are confined within the parameters of their own repeated mistakes and failures. The <b>still</b> <b>images</b> also serve as a form of self-reflexivity for cinema itself. It sheds light on the fact that films are not really moving at all but are actually composed of <b>still</b> <b>images</b> that move at a much quicker rate than those in Dog's Dialogue. Ruiz demonstrates that cinema is photographic. A major subject {{in the film}} is the difference between stillness and movement itself and how although the gestures are repeated they still have an initial believable quality.|$|R
40|$|Most vision {{research}} on motion analysis focuses on learning human actions from video clips. In this paper, we investigate {{the use of}} <b>still</b> <b>images,</b> rather than videos, for motion recog-nition. We present evidence from both human cognition and computer vision that <b>still</b> <b>images</b> do indeed contain {{a wealth of information}} about motion patterns. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we automatically determine classes of mo-tions that can effectively be characterized by <b>still</b> <b>images.</b> To make this determination we introduce the notions of motion verbs (M-verbs) and motion phrases (M-phrases); these refer to linguistic concepts motivated by visual cognition and are not restricted only to motions performed by humans. Second, we build UCSD- 1024, a large dataset distilled from more than two million <b>still</b> <b>images.</b> These images come from 1, 024 categories of motion; we use crowdsourcing to provide human validation of the motion categories. Third, we exploit motion patterns from UCSD- 1024 using a weakly-supervised learning strategy and demonstrate performance competitive with state-of-the-art computer vision action classification methods...|$|R

25|$|During this infant {{commercial}} development, many incorrectly {{predicted that}} the moving images of fluoroscopy would completely replace roentgenographs (radiographic <b>still</b> <b>image</b> films), but the then superior diagnostic quality of the roentgenograph and their already alluded safety enhancement of lower radiation dose via shorter exposure prevented this from occurring. Another factor was that plain films inherently offered recording of the image in a simple and inexpensive way, whereas recording and playback of fluoroscopy remained a more complex and expensive proposition {{for decades to come}} (discussed in detail below).|$|E
25|$|Wong {{sent the}} {{newsreel}} footage on a U.S. Navy ship to Manila and from there, {{the film was}} flown to New York City aboard a Pan American World Airways airliner. Beginning in mid-September 1937, the newsreel was shown to movie theater audiences, estimated a month later to number 50 {{million people in the}} U.S. and 30million outside of the U.S. and the <b>still</b> <b>image</b> of the crying baby was printed in Hearst Corporation newspapers and affiliates, some 25 million copies. A further 1.75million non-Hearst newspaper copies showed the image in the U.S., and 4million more people saw it as a matte reproduction in other newspapers. Some 25million people saw it internationally. It first appeared in Life magazine on October 4, 1937, at which point it was estimated that 136million people had seen it. On the facing page in Life magazine, another photograph showed the baby on a stretcher receiving medical care.|$|E

However, a mere extension of the training set with <b>still</b> <b>images</b> does not yield a large gain in classification accuracy. We show that using a combination of techniques for bridging the differences between <b>still</b> <b>images</b> and video keyframes improves classification performance compared to simply augmenting the training set...|$|R

25|$|For the program's first 25 years, weather {{reports were}} {{delivered}} by the host or newsreader. Dave Garroway illustrated the day's forecast by drawing fronts and areas of precipitation on a big chalkboard map of the United States, based on information gathered earlier in the morning from the U.S. Weather Bureau in Washington, D.C. Subsequent hosts John Chancellor and Hugh Downs dropped the chalkboard weather map concept, and instead read a prepared weather summary over a <b>still</b> <b>image</b> of a weather map. When the show converted to all-color broadcasts in 1965, weather maps were prepared and projected on a screen behind Frank Blair, who delivered the forecast immediately after his news summaries. Following Blair's retirement on March 14, 1975, Lew Wood took over the newsreader and weather reporting duties. When Floyd Kalber was brought in as newsreader in 1976, Wood was relegated to weather, sports, roving reporter assignments, and presenting live on-air commercials until his departure in 1978.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{another kind}} is actual video spam, giving the {{uploaded}} movie {{a name and}} description with a popular figure or event {{that is likely to}} draw attention, or within the video has a certain image timed to come up as the video's thumbnail image to mislead the viewer, such as a <b>still</b> <b>image</b> from a feature film, purporting to be a part-by-part piece of a movie being pirated, e.g. Big Buck Bunny Full Movie Online - Part 1/10 HD, a link to a supposed keygen, trainer, ISO file for a video game, or something similar. The actual content of the video ends up being totally unrelated, a Rickroll, offensive, or simply on-screen text of a link to the site being promoted. In some cases, the link in question may lead to an online survey site, a password-protected archive file with instructions leading to the aforementioned survey (though the survey, and the archive file itself, is worthless and doesn't contain the file in question at all), or in extreme cases, malware. Others may upload videos presented in an infomercial-like format selling their product which feature actors and paid testimonials, though the promoted product or service is of dubious quality and would likely not pass the scrutiny of a standards and practices department at a television station or cable network.|$|E
