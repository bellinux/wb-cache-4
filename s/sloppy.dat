5|$|A {{weekend edition}} titled Super <b>Sloppy</b> Double Dare began taping in July 1987 and premiered August 2, 1987, {{with an initial}} 26-episode run. Super <b>Sloppy</b> Double Dare {{featured}} gameplay {{identical to the original}} format; however, physical challenges and obstacles were designed to make a bigger mess. Viewers were encouraged to send in a postcard with their contact information and could win a prize if their card was selected, and a team performing a physical challenge completed the stunt successfully. Episodes of Super <b>Sloppy</b> Double Dare were taped at Unitel Studio in New York City before production moved back to WHYY-TV.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, Skylab 3 {{took two}} orb-web spiders into space {{to test their}} web-spinning {{capabilities}} in zero gravity. At first, both produced rather <b>sloppy</b> webs, but they adapted quickly.|$|E
5000|$|Cycledelic was [...] "absolute madness. The {{greatest}} songs, the <b>sloppiest</b> playing, a {{voice to}} make Billy Bragg feel grateful and the sheer immortality of the since-oft-covered [...] "Darling, Let’s Have Another Baby". Rating: nine out of ten".|$|R
60|$|Somebody {{else had}} come in quietly by the folding-doors. Turning his head, Wegg beheld his persecutor, the ever-wakeful dustman, accoutred with fantail hat and {{velveteen}} smalls complete. Who, untying his tied-up broken head, revealed a head that was whole, and a face that was <b>Sloppy's.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{director}} originally {{assigned to}} the film was Fred Zinnemann, but he withdrew, {{and was replaced by}} John Sturges. The film's budget, originally $2 million, grew to $5 million [...] "in search of suitable fish footage." [...] Sturges called it [...] "technically the <b>sloppiest</b> picture I have ever made." ...|$|R
5|$|Each team on Double Dare and Super <b>Sloppy</b> Double Dare {{consisted}} of two children, while teams on Family Double Dare and Double Dare 2000 included two adults and two children. Originally, both teams wore red uniforms, but after Double Dare entered syndication in 1988, one team wore blue uniforms while the other wore red.|$|E
5|$|On January 15, 1927, the Senators traded Peckinpaugh to the Chicago White Sox for Leo Mangum and <b>Sloppy</b> Thurston. However, {{his playing}} {{time with the}} White Sox was limited by a leg injury. He acted as an advisor to manager Ray Schalk. After one season with the White Sox, Peckinpaugh retired as a player.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–05 {{season was}} marked with <b>sloppy</b> play and ragged offense; UConn lost 8 games {{and failed to}} win the Big East regular season crown {{for the first time}} since 1993. In the NCAA tournament, UConn lost to Stanford in the Sweet Sixteen.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} among {{fans who}} purchased {{the album was}} mixed. Many appreciated that the current line-up of the band finally had an official live release. Others also appreciated that the recording was done with modern recording equipment leading to a crisp, modern sound. The band was also applauded for clean, tight performances compared to <b>sloppier</b> performances in older recordings.|$|R
500|$|Four {{collections}} of Double Dare highlights and special features were released on home video by Kids Klassics on October 1, 1988, Double Dare: The Inside Scoop and Double Dare: The Messiest Moments. [...] On October 17, 1989, a home party guide titled How to Throw a Double Dare Party {{was released by}} Elektra Video. Sony Wonder released Double Dare: Super <b>Sloppiest</b> Moments on May 31, 1994.|$|R
50|$|In the {{television}} series, {{the character of}} Det. Sid Kirmani, portrayed by Raoul Bhaneja, {{appeared to have been}} based at least in part on Carmichael. He, like Carmichael, is highly skeptical of Harry's intentions and rejects the idea of magic out of hand. However, he is much younger, thinner and more dapper, and some episodes imply that he is a <b>sloppier</b> detective than his novel counterpart.|$|R
5|$|A {{continuation}} for syndication premiered on February 22, 1988, later revamped as Super <b>Sloppy</b> Double Dare on January 22, 1989. The {{program also}} had a short run on Fox as Family Double Dare, airing from April 3 to July 23, 1988. Nickelodeon continued Family Double Dare, premiering a new version on October 6, 1990. The original series ended on February 6, 1993. A later revival, hosted by Jason Harris and titled Double Dare 2000, aired from January 22 to November 10, 2000.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} Wallace's {{thinking}} was his belief that, {{because of the}} action of natural selection, organisms were {{in a state of}} balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results. Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a <b>sloppy</b> and unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Falafel {{has become}} popular among vegetarians and vegans, as an {{alternative}} to meat-based street foods, and is now sold in packaged mixes in health-food stores. While traditionally thought of as being used to make veggie burgers, its use has expanded as more and more people have adopted it as a source of protein. In the United States, falafel's versatility has allowed for the reformulating of recipes for meatloaf, <b>sloppy</b> joes and spaghetti and meatballs into vegetarian dishes.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2007, {{the band}} {{recorded}} three nights of performances in San Francisco, California, for their second live album, They've Actually Gotten Worse Live!, released November 20, 2007. The live album is {{described on the}} press release as [...] "their <b>sloppiest,</b> drunkest, funniest, best sounding recording ever … and they even made sure not to play any songs off their 1995 live album I Heard They Suck Live." ...|$|R

5|$|On Double Dare and Super <b>Sloppy</b> Double Dare, both contestants {{on a team}} {{competed in}} all {{physical}} challenges. For the 1988 version of Family Double Dare, all four members of a team competed in the challenges. On the 1990–93 version of Family Double Dare and on Double Dare 2000, two members of a team competed in round one, and all four members competed in round two.|$|E
5|$|On January 5, 1989, {{production}} {{began on}} {{a new version of}} Super <b>Sloppy</b> Double Dare from Philadelphia at WHYY-TV, continuing in syndication. The series premiered on January 22, 1989. The second half of the series was produced at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, with production beginning in April 1989. This version of the show recorded in larger studios with a larger set allowed for a lower level devoted to physical challenges and obstacles with a bigger size and, typically, bigger messes. Many episodes {{in this part of the}} series featured unique and offbeat themes that questions, challenges, and sometimes wardrobe would be patterned after. Themes included a Salute to Baseball, Backwards Day, Stupid Hat Day, a Salute to Breakfast, and two Super-Slop-a-Mania episodes featuring wrestlers and personalities from the World Wrestling Federation. Another special episode saw Summers and Harvey each team with a contestant to compete against each other, with Jim J. Bullock taking over hosting duties. By the end of Super <b>Sloppy</b> Double Dare, the program was syndicated to 154 stations. The series left syndication on September 8, 1989.|$|E
5|$|After {{separating}} {{from the}} Atlas booster, Schirra stabilized the spacecraft and slowly cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, {{and was able}} to position the capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves. He briefly tracked the spent booster, which was rotating slowly past, but made no attempt to move towards it. As the spacecraft moved across the Atlantic, he turned his attention to testing manual control of the spacecraft, which he found <b>sloppy</b> compared to the fly-by-wire system.|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{analysis}} {{appeared in}} The New Republic. In {{his review of}} The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, fellow 'new historian' Benny Morris wrote, [...] "At best, Ilan Pappe {{must be one of}} the world's <b>sloppiest</b> historians; at worst, one of the most dishonest. In truth, he probably merits a place somewhere between the two." [...] Morris argued, [...] "Such distortions, large and small, characterize almost every page of The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{first inning}} gave notice {{that this would}} be one of the <b>sloppiest</b> All-Star games in history. Steve Sax led off the game by {{reaching}} on an error by AL starting pitcher Dave Stieb. Sax stole second and scored when next batter Tim Raines grounded to Stieb and Stieb threw wildly past Rod Carew at first. Raines reached third, but couldn't score as Stieb struck out the side; Andre Dawson, Dale Murphy, and Mike Schmidt all fanned.|$|R
5000|$|Rainey: “Gardner {{ran into}} the back of me twice, and didn’t even notice. He was one of the <b>sloppiest</b> guys I ever raced - he {{reminded}} me of a bulldog on a bike. When he was on a good day, he could ride that thing right out of the saddle. He was a bit like Kevin, but more out of control. Not a thinking racer: he rode by the excitement of the crowd. If nobody was there I think he wouldn’t do much.” ...|$|R
5|$|Following Sean Connery's {{announcement}} {{that he would}} not play James Bond again, Eastwood was offered the role but turned it down because he believed the character should be played by an English actor. He next starred in the loner Western Joe Kidd (1972), based on a character inspired by Reies Lopez Tijerina, who stormed a courthouse in Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico in June 1967. During filming, Eastwood suffered symptoms of a bronchial infection and several panic attacks. Joe Kidd received a mixed reception, with Roger Greenspun of The New York Times writing that it was unremarkable, with foolish symbolism and <b>sloppy</b> editing, although he praised Eastwood's performance.|$|E
5|$|Food {{selection}} at {{the restaurant}} comes from the traditional cuisine of the United States. Popcorn is served as a free hors d'oeuvre. Other food items include milkshakes, hot fudge sundaes, seafood salad, turkey <b>sloppy</b> joes, fried pickles, St. Louis-style barbecue ribs, beef-and-blue-cheese salads, sautéed shrimp with farfalle, French fries, cucumber salads, Buffalo wings, Boca Burgers, Tofutti, and steaks. Drinks include souvenir phosphorescent ice cubes. The desserts are served in larger portions than are customary elsewhere. There are vegetarian options. The chefs at the Sci-Fi Dine-In sometimes cater for special requests in advance. The cookbook Delicious Disney Just for Kids contains a recipe for the BLT soup served at the Sci-Fi Dine-In.|$|E
5|$|Jamie Bojanowski and Chris Miles joined Robin Marrella as stage assistants for Family Double Dare, {{replacing}} Dave Shikiar {{who left}} the series between the ending of Super <b>Sloppy</b> Double Dare in 1989 {{and the beginning of}} Family Double Dare in 1990 to pursue production opportunities on other programs like The Home Show and Wild & Crazy Kids. In order to spend time with his wife and his newborn son Caleb, Harvey did not announce the last season of Family Double Dare in 1992. He was replaced as announcer by Doc Holliday, an Orlando-area radio host on WXXL's Doc & Johnny in the Morning. Harvey made a cameo appearance on the final episode of the season and the series.|$|E
50|$|On 17 July 1791, Hébert {{was at the}} Champ de Mars to sign a {{petition}} to demand the removal of King Louis XVI and {{was caught up in}} the subsequent Champ de Mars massacre by troops under Lafayette. This put him in the revolutionary mindset, and the Le Père Duchesne adopted a <b>sloppier</b> style to better appeal to the masses. Le Père Duchesne began to attack Lafayette, Mirabeau, and Bailly. Following Louis's failed flight to Varennes he began to attack both Louis and Pope Pius VI as well.|$|R
50|$|Sometime after Bruce has donned {{the mantle}} of Batman, Alton, a Talon who held the mantle longer than the rest, is getting <b>sloppier</b> in his work. Alton is told by the Court {{that he will be}} retired. Scared, Alton rushes off to see who is to replace him. He discovers that it is Richard Grayson/Nightwing, the heir of William Cobb. Soon after, Alton is put on his final test, but is stopped by Batman, who had {{investigated}} the existence of the court as a child but never found any evidence to support his theory.|$|R
60|$|As I left Dullborough in {{the days}} when there were no railroads in the land, I left it in a stage-coach. Through all the years that have since passed, have I ever lost the smell of the damp straw in which I was packed--like game--and forwarded, {{carriage}} paid, to the Cross Keys, Wood-street, Cheapside, London? There was no other inside passenger, and I consumed my sandwiches in solitude and dreariness, and it rained hard all the way, and I thought life <b>sloppier</b> than I had expected to find it.|$|R
5|$|John Kadlec, a {{consulting}} engineer {{on the original}} construction, has testified that he raised concerns at the time about <b>sloppy</b> workmanship and inadequate construction materials at the site, including structural columns that were already crooked, steel beams that were already rusting despite being new, and the ultimately fateful decision to place the complex's parking area on the roof. According to Kadlec, the construction company opted to resolve the structural issues not by redoing the construction, but by anchoring the building's back wall to the rock outcropping behind it. James Keywan, the building's original architect, testified that he also strongly objected to the rooftop parking, but had little choice once Algocen made their decision to proceed with that plan.|$|E
5|$|Network {{synthesis}} filters. The mathematical {{bases of}} network synthesis were {{laid in the}} 1930s and 1940s. After the end of World War II network synthesis became the primary tool of filter design. Network synthesis put filter design on a firm mathematical foundation, freeing it from the mathematically <b>sloppy</b> techniques of image design and severing the connection with physical lines. The essence of network synthesis is that it produces a design that will (at least if implemented with ideal components) accurately reproduce the response originally specified in black box terms.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2011, {{the three}} year-old {{finished}} {{fifth in the}} Belmont Stakes after holding the lead {{for much of the}} race on a <b>sloppy</b> track. As the pacesetter, Shackleford led throughout most of the 1-1/2 mile race, which started with a moderate quarter-mile in :23.9, then slowed to a leisurely :49.0 for the opening half, 1:14.5 for three-quarters, and 1:39.9 for a mile. After leading the first nine furlongs, he faded in the stretch. Winner Ruler On Ice as well as Stay Thirsty, Brilliant Speed and Nehro passed him.|$|E
5000|$|The {{game was}} poorly {{received}} by critics and gamers alike. On IGN, it received a 3 out of 10, reviewer Craig Harris stating [...] "Cartoon Network Speedway {{is one of}} the <b>sloppiest</b> and most generic kart racers released on the Game Boy Advance." [...] It currently has a 53% rating on GameRankings. It was also given a 65 out of 100 from Next Level Gaming, a 3 out of 5 from Nintendo Power, and 58 out of 100 from VG-Force. Complaints centered on bad and choppy graphics, the slow pace, that Dexter and The Powerpuff Girls were not available, and the lack of challenge.|$|R
50|$|Later in the 1980s, the BBC {{launched}} Double Dare, {{based on}} the US style format, but much <b>sloppier</b> than its U.S. counterpart. Also, gunge started to appear on mainstream shows such as Game for a Laugh on ITV and Noel Edmond's Saturday Roadshow on the BBC.Other countries in Europe also started to have gunge elements on mainstream shows. Un Dos Tres on TVE in Spain often had contestants throwing buckets of gunge at each other. Also, Donnerlippchen, a television show in Germany, had many messy games; {{the climax of the}} show was dunking the team's suited boss in a dunk tank and pouring custard down inside every team members pair of boxer shorts.|$|R
50|$|Living as 'Boogiepop', Taniguchi stopped {{returning}} home. Finding {{new targets}} by himself, {{he continued to}} act {{the part of a}} hero, but was gradually becoming <b>sloppier</b> in his actions. Kinukawa and some of her hired thugs managed to find Taniguchi and tried to use him to kill 'Boogiepop', thereby making the real Boogiepop a fake in the eyes of others. Though able to protect himself against the initial attack, Taniguchi was soon overwhelmed, however, he was rescued by Kirima, who had also been looking for him. She defeated the attackers and freed them all from Spooky E's control. Kinukawa escaped, but was found by Asukai, who restored her to normal, as he had done with many of the other Terminals.|$|R
