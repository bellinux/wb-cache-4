40|$|Abstract: This work {{presents}} {{current issues}} {{in the development of}} VR interfaces for product geometry design. The ongoing research addresses two main topics: user anisotropy during 3 D space interaction and the reduced perception along depth direction especially when visual occlusion occurs. We propose a user aligned <b>snap</b> <b>tool</b> and the use of vibro-feedback to improve basic CAD tasks in VR as pointing, picking and selecting. The proposed solutions have been validated by statistical analysis with practical tests. The presented results offer a significant contribution for developers of modelling applications in Virtual Reality...|$|E
40|$|In the {{academic}} debate regarding the influences between urban form, built environment and travel patterns, a specific idea {{that has taken}} hold is that more compact urban development around railway stations, {{often referred to as}} Transit Oriented Development (TOD), contributes to the control of vehicle travel and to more sustainable metropolitan systems. According to this general principle this work proposes a GIS accessibility tool for the design of polycentric transit oriented scenario: SNAP - Station Network Accessibility Planning tool. In the first part {{the state of the art}} on Transit Oriented Development policies in Europe is presented with a focus on three study cases. In the second part the <b>SNAP</b> <b>tool</b> is described, with remarks to the approach, the methodology and the used indicators. Furthermore the paper discusses an application to the metropolitan area of Naples...|$|E

It can paste bitmap images from clipboard or import from JPEG or BMP, and also through a conversion software it can import PDF figures generated by other software. It differentiates itself from similar programs by including advanced <b>snapping</b> <b>tools</b> {{and the ability to}} directly include LaTeX text and equations. Ipe is extensible by use of ipelets, which are plugins written in C++ or Lua.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a semi-automatic cartographic image interpretation {{system in which}} techniques previously applied to monochrome images are generalised to colour and extended to support digitization of {{the full range of}} multicoloured cartographic objects. A <b>snapping</b> <b>tool</b> eases the selection of seed points, speeding interpretation. Line and area objects are identified automatically and a suitable target representation (skeleton or contour) produced for each. This simplifies interaction as the user does not have to vary his/her behaviour with object type. Multi-coloured objects can be constructed from their components with ease and correction <b>tools</b> such as <b>snapping</b> and undo both save time and decrease error rates. ...|$|R

25|$|To {{apply for}} SNAP benefits, an {{applicant}} must first {{fill out a}} program application {{and return it to}} the state or local SNAP office. Each state has a different application, which is usually available online. There is more information about various state applications processes, including locations of SNAP offices in various state, displayed on an interactive Outreach Map found on the FNS website. Individuals who believe they may be eligible for SNAP benefits may use the Food and Nutrition Services’ <b>SNAP</b> Screening <b>Tool,</b> which can help gauge eligibility.|$|R

Soon the blade of the frail <b>tool</b> <b>snapped</b> at the handle, and he tried the other blade. That, too, soon broke and Runyon regarded the can with a sort of wonder.|$|R

They attempt to fit model parameters so that the likelihood that a given original graph O was generated starting from an initiator matrix I is maximized, and propose the kronfit gradient descent algorithm that iteratively estimates I in O(m) time. They do not explicitly mention the case of creating a scaled replica, {{but it is clear that}} the method is capable of producing graphs for arbitrary exponents s. We use an implementation of kronfit which is distributed with the <b>SNAP</b> network analysis <b>tool</b> suite (Leskovec and Sosič 2014).|$|R
50|$|When {{closed and}} {{hanging on a}} wall it takes up an area of {{approximately}} 39 inches by 20 inches with a 9 inch depth. It opens to become a 40 inch by 40 inch tool chest. The chest {{is made out of}} mahogany, rosewood, walnut, ebony, ivory and mother of pearl, materials that were probably taken from the Poole Piano Company's scrap material. The fine craftsmanship is exhibited by the fact that each tool fits snugly into its space, often with an audible click as the <b>tool</b> <b>snaps</b> into its close-fit cavity. Sections of the chest swing out of the case to allow access to a second, and even third, layer of tools. The tool chest features Masonic symbolism, including the Square and Compasses emblem and Royal Arch symbols.|$|R
40|$|The new CNMP {{program of}} the NRCS {{requires}} simultaneous integration of five components: A conservation plan (RUSLE 2); A nutrient management plan (NRCS 590 – P based); A record keeping program (CNMP); A manure/wastewater manager (CNMP); A feed management program (CNMP). Most of these components are prepared tediously, by hand, often independently of each other. We have linked software programs that deal with conservation planning, nutrient management, record keeping, and manure management into a single software tool called SNAP-Plus, which has a simple user interface and output forms. The outputs of this tool can then be combined into a CNMP. The SNAP-Plus software {{is based on a}} widely accepted and easy to use nutrient management <b>tool,</b> <b>SNAP</b> 2000; to which we have added the new Wisconsin P Index (PI); a P and K balancer; and the soil erosio...|$|R
40|$|Modifications on histones or on DNA recruit {{proteins}} that regulate chromatin function. Here, we use nucleosomes methylated on DNA and on histone H 3 in an affinity assay, {{in conjunction with}} a SILAC-based proteomic analysis, to identify crosstalk between these two distinct classes of modification. Our analysis reveals proteins whose binding to nucleosomes is regulated by methylation of CpGs, H 3 K 4, H 3 K 9, and H 3 K 27 or a combination thereof. We identify the origin recognition complex (ORC), including LRWD 1 as a subunit, to be a methylation-sensitive nucleosome interactor that is recruited cooperatively by DNA and histone methylation. Other interactors, such as the lysine demethylase Fbxl 11 /KDM 2 A, recognize nucleosomes methylated on histones, but their recruitment is disrupted by DNA methylation. These data establish SILAC nucleosome affinity purifications (<b>SNAP)</b> as a <b>tool</b> for studying the dynamics between different chromatin modifications and provide a modification binding profile for proteins regulated by DNA and histone methylation...|$|R
60|$|On Lord Methuen himself no blame {{can rest}} for this {{unsuccessful}} action. If the workman's <b>tool</b> <b>snaps</b> {{in his hand}} he cannot {{be held responsible for}} the failure of his task. The troops who misbehaved were none of his training. 'If you hear anyone slang him,' says one of his men, 'you are to tell them that he is the finest General and the truest gentleman that ever fought in this war.' Such was the tone of his own troopers, and such also that of the spokesmen of the nation when they commented upon the disaster in the Houses of Parliament. It was a fine example of British justice and sense of fair play, even in that bitter moment, that to hear his eulogy one would have thought that the occasion had been one when thanks were being returned for a victory. It is a generous public with fine instincts, and Paul Methuen, wounded and broken, still remained in their eyes the heroic soldier and the chivalrous man of honour.|$|R
40|$|From the introduction] Since 1961, food stamps, {{currently}} {{known as}} the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, have been assisting low-income households (Timeline). SNAP gives low-income households the ability to increase their food expenditures, curbing fears of food insecurity. With the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977, the program expanded to include full-time post-secondary students. To qualify, a student must have a federal work study job (FWS) or work at least 20 hours a week (Johnson). Student usage remained low and largely unnoticed until the last decade, when several state governments experienced sharp increases in participation. Tight budgets are forcing governments to make cuts; {{and it is important}} that inefficiencies are cut out of programs to maximize program success. Low income students should continue to receive benefits as SNAP seemingly provides a two-pronged benefit: On one side helping students afford healthy, well rounded meals, while simultaneously making college more affordable. The student population possesses several qualities distinguishing them from other SNAP recipients, as many students come from affluent families, and only temporarily reside in low-income households. Other students lack the education necessary to make proper dietary choices, resulting in the purchase of high caloric items with poor nutritional values. The goal of SNAP is to increase nutrition, not to allow participants to splurge on items such as sweetened beverages, snack food, and entertainment. SNAP’s connection to FWS also mitigates some of the concerns about the program: FWS directly targets low-income families, with monthly benefits reducing the need of student loans and the fear of future debt. This increases the appeal of attending college, making <b>SNAP</b> a useful <b>tool</b> for increasing student food expenditures, improving dietary outcomes, and making college more affordable. To research {{the question of whether or}} not students should continue receiving benefits an anonymous survey of Pacific University students was conducted. The survey asked questions revolving around food security, food expenditures, college affordability, health habits, and personal attitudes towards student usage of SNAP. Sample averages were then compared between three subgroups: those currently participating in SNAP, those eligible and not participating, and those ineligible. The study concluded that SNAP participants where a needy population, did not abuse program benefits, and increased the affordability of college. An expanded analysis is presented throughout the reading; beginning with the background of SNAP as a whole, an expanded methodology section, and then a presentation of the comprehensive results and analysis...|$|R
40|$|When we send {{humans to}} search for life on other planets, we'll {{need to know what}} we brought with us versus what may already be there. To ensure our crewed systems meet {{planetary}} protection requirements-and to protect our science from human contamination-we'll need to assess whether microorganisms may be leaking or venting from our spacecraft. Microbial sample collection outside of a pressurized spacecraft is complicated by temperature extremes, low pressures that preclude the use of laboratory standard (wetted) swabs, and operation either in bulky spacesuits or with robotic assistance. Engineers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recently developed a swab kit for use in collecting microbial samples from the external surfaces of crewed spacecraft, including spacesuits. The Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Swab Kit consists of a single swab tool handle and an eight-canister sample caddy. The design team minimized development cost by re-purposing a heritage Space Shuttle tile repair handle that was designed to quickly <b>snap</b> into different <b>tool</b> attachments by engaging a mating device in each attachment. This allowed the <b>tool</b> handle to <b>snap</b> onto a fresh swab attachment much like popular shaving razor handles can snap onto a disposable blade cartridge. To disengage the handle from a swab, the user performs two independent functions, which can be done with a single hand. This dual operation mitigates the risk that a swab will be inadvertently released and lost in microgravity. Each swab attachment is fitted with commercially available foam swab tips, vendor-certified to be sterile for Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). A microbial filter installed in the bottom of each sample container allows the container to outgas and repressurize without introducing microbial contaminants to internal void spaces. Extensive ground testing, post-test handling, and sample analysis confirmed the design is able to maintain sterile conditions as the canister moves between various pressure environments. To further minimize cost, the design team acquired extensive ground test experience in a relevant flight environment by piggy-backing onto suited crew training runs. These training runs allowed the project to validate tool interfaces with pressurized EVA gloves and collect user feedback on the tool design and function, as well as characterize baseline microbial data for different types of spacesuits. In general, test subjects found the EVA Swab Kit relatively straightforward to operate, but identified a number of design improvements that will be incorporated into the final design. Although originally intended to help characterize human forward contaminants, this tool has other potential applications, such as for collecting and preserving space-exposed materials to support astrobiology experiments...|$|R
