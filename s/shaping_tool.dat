5000|$|Roller-head machine: This {{machine is}} for shaping wares on a {{rotating}} mould, as in jiggering and jolleying, {{but with a}} rotary <b>shaping</b> <b>tool</b> replacing the fixed profile. The rotary <b>shaping</b> <b>tool</b> is a shallow cone having the same diameter as the ware being formed and shaped to the desired form {{of the back of}} the article being made. Wares may in this way be shaped, using relatively unskilled labour, in one operation at a rate of about twelve pieces per minute, though this varies with the size of the articles being produced. Developed in the UK just after World War II by the company Service Engineers, roller-heads were quickly adopted by manufacturers around the world; they remain the dominant method for producing flatware.|$|E

5000|$|The HMGF {{process is}} {{compatible}} with almost any metal. The most significant benefit of HMGF is that cold form resistant materials become viable for complex forming. Often, alloys are enhanced with expensive materials to enable cold forming and increase machinability, however with HMFG a less expensive alloy can be used, which reduces piece prices. One example {{is the use of}} ferritic stainless steels, like the 1.4512 alloy for exhaust components. Typically, the more expensive austenitic stainless is chosen, like the 1.4301 alloy, for parts requiring complex forming due to its 40% advantage in ambient formability (38.5% vs. 27.4% typical A%).Hardenable metal alloys (e.g. boron steels) can be used in HMGF. In this case the die can be used not only as a <b>shaping</b> <b>tool,</b> but also as a tempering tool, so that the final hardness of the formed tube after forming and cooling is increased. The process is often called [...] "press hardening" [...] in this case.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{describes a}} process for the shaping of electrically conducting terminal bumps on electrically conducting microelectronic connecting elements. In conventional processes, a terminal bump is produced in a deep-draw process, whereby the connecting element is pressed by a die into a recess of a substrate on which the connecting element is fixed. The disadvantage is that a recess occurs next to the terminal bump on the side facing the die, said recess being deleterious for the mechanical loading capability and also for subsequent tab bonding. In the process according to the invention, however, a <b>shaping</b> <b>tool</b> is pressed onto part of {{the surface of a}} connecting element, whereby one or more terminal bumps are formed by the plastic deformation of the connecting element material {{in this part of the}} surface due to the geometry of the <b>shaping</b> <b>tool,</b> however, the connecting element suffers no further deformation outside said part of the surface. The advantages of the process according t o the invention are that no shaping substrate matched to the desired terminal bumps is required, that conventional wire bonding units can be used, that the process is fast, low-priced and precise and that the mechanical loading capability of a connecting element, in particular a metal lead, is [...] due to the formation. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{optimization}} of a low-boom supersonic aircraft using the state-of-the- art o -body aerodynamics and sonic boom analysis {{has long been}} a challenging problem. The focus {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate an e ective geometry parameterization scheme and a numerical optimization approach for the aft shaping of a low-boom supersonic aircraft using o -body pressure calculations. A gradient-based numerical optimization algorithm that models the objective and constraints as response surface equations is used to drive the aft ground signature toward a ramp shape. The design objective is the minimization of the variation between the ground signature and the target signature subject to several geometric and signature constraints. The target signature is computed by using a least-squares regression of the aft portion of the ground signature. The parameterization and the deformation of the geometry is performed with a NASA in- house <b>shaping</b> <b>tool.</b> The optimization algorithm uses the <b>shaping</b> <b>tool</b> to drive the geometric deformation of a horizontal tail with a parameterization scheme that consists of seven camber design variables and an additional design variable that describes the spanwise location of the midspan section. The demonstration cases show that numerical optimization using the state-of-the-art o -body aerodynamic calculations is not only feasible and repeatable but also allows the exploration of complex design spaces for which a knowledge-based design method becomes less effective...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the theory}} of solid mechanics, a group of “defoxels” have been defined and used to create three {{dimensional}} virtual shapes. A defoxel {{can be viewed as}} a force (or a source) which is capable to deform objects or meshes accordingly in a nature way. The defoxel acts as an abstract notation for distortion in space and a collection of defoxels are capable of creating complex deformation patterns, presenting rich variation in terms of curvature and distortion of shapes. The beauty of using this notation is the capability of generating a collection of shaping effects instantly with the same setting of defoxels when feeding different shapes to deform. Furthermore, we have implemented an Autodesk|Maya plug-in to assist artists to create art pieces with defoxels interactively, leading to the desired demonstrations. With a few examples, the paper envisages the potential of defoxels as a <b>shaping</b> <b>tool</b> to reflect tensions and deformations in space...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems: Geology, 2009 Kodiak Island {{archipelago}} {{has experienced}} multiple Quaternary glaciations that periodically covered the entire island, at times less a small refugium, under a regional ice cap. During glacial maxima, with relatively lower sea levels, {{large areas of}} the continental shelf were subaerially exposed as broad, low-relief plateaus between trunk glacier troughs. The continental shelf southeast of the islands was dissected by outlet glaciers draining the Kodiak Ice Cap uplands during the maximum extent of these glaciations. These trunk glaciers carved massive troughs into the shelf. Deglaciation after the last glacial maximum (LGM) occurred rapidly. By ~ 13. 5 ka, ice had retreated to subaerially expose portions of modern Kodiak Island. Between ~ 13. 5 ka and ~ 7 ka the average rate of deglacial isostatic uplift at Narrow Cape was ~ 17. 5 m/ky, with initial rates reaching ~ 6 meters per century.

40|$|DN-Edit is {{a virtual}} {{environment}} developed to allow the manipulation of non-uniform rational b-spline (NURBS) surfaces using virtual shaping tools. NURBS have become the industry standard for representation of free-form curves and surfaces. The contribution of the work presented here is {{in the development of}} shaping tools which are used to operate directly on the NURBS data and change the shape of the surfaces in a virtual environment. These shaping tools allow surface manipulations to be made using methods that match the shaping of real malleable objects. The virtual shaping tools are threedimensional shapes that are controlled through a six degree-of-freedom tracking system that converts user hand motions into computer input. The NURBS surface updates itself in real time due to the effect of the tools on the surface. The new shape of the surface is dependent on the position and orientation of the <b>shaping</b> <b>tool</b> relative to the surface. Constraint-based surface manipulation is used to obtain multiple point direct manipulation of NURBS surfaces. In addition, computational methods to allow the user to have direct control of the first derivative of the surface over an area are implemented. This application has been developed using the C 2 software libraries and Iowa State University’s C 2 surround screen virtual environment...|$|E

The institution of the Sami National Day is used as a <b>shaping</b> <b>tool</b> of the concept of identity. In this work I investigate the way the celebration of Sami Day has changed since the time the holiday was established in 1993 up to nowadays: in the past the celebration had a small-scale, local, character, uniting a limited number of the Sami people and their friends, while today the Sami National Day unites the whole city and is celebrated not only by the Sami - the number of which has significantly increased - but also by foreigners and Norwegians living in the city. On the basis of this analysis I research the way Tromsø Sami identity has developed over the last 20 years: it has become much more visible in society and stronger. Moreover, I investigate the issue of the level of development according to my research model Tromsø Sami identity is today.

40|$|With {{the vast}} {{increase}} {{in the amount of}} data transfer around the world each day, there has been a necessity for rapid development in optical communication and signal processing technologies. Using an all optical scheme to replace the current electronic format shows promise in the next generation of signal processing. In an optical processing system, the optical delay line buffer is a critical component. While significant research has been done on novel delay line schemes, {{it will be necessary to}} develop a CMOS compatible technology capable of integration onto a micro-chip. In this thesis, a multi- slotted waveguide has been studied as a novel element for optical delay line applications. Detailed simulations show large birefringence between the polarization modes in a multi-slot waveguide which enables the creation of a time delay. The birefringence was optimized by the use of fabricated structures with high refractive index contrast to create a compact single-mode waveguide, through the etching of deep sub-wavelength channels within the waveguide. The channels (comprising Si ribs and air gaps) are strongly coupled in the near field. The multi-slot waveguides were successfully fabricated and giant birefringence property was demonstrated. The obtained value of [Delta]ng was ̃ 1. 6 at 1. 55 [mu]m. When used as a polarization-selective delay line element, the delay- bandwidth product was computed to be 40 /mm which is comparable to existing delay line schemes. A mode <b>shaping</b> <b>tool</b> was also designed to shape the near field mode and achieve almost identical coupling to external optics. This reduces the polarization dependent loss.
