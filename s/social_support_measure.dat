40|$|Overview The current thesis {{reports on}} the design and {{development}} of a <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> which explores the perceived functional social support needs of family members who have a relative with a substance related problem. A mixed methodological approach was adopted to operationalise the concept of social support specific to concerned and affected family members, thus completing the nomological set of instruments required to quantitatively assess the Stress-Strain-Coping-Support (SSCS) theoretical model of addiction and the family. Methods The 75 -item self-completion Alcohol, Drugs and the Family Social Support Scale (ADF SSS) was piloted with 10 family members, and the resultant 58 -item measure was then subjected to extensive psychometric testing with 132 family members, and qualitative feedback was gleaned from 110 family members. This resulted {{in the production of}} a refined 25 -item questionnaire. Findings Preliminary findings on the refined 25 -item questionnaire indicate satisfactory levels of reliability (internal and test-retest) and validity (content and construct) for the overall measure and each of the three constituent sub-scales: frequency of positively perceived general (α= 0. 913) and ADF related (α= 0. 727) functional support, and frequency of negatively perceived ADF specific (α= 0. 851) functional support. Qualitative information from family members revealed that the questionnaire was experientially applicable to their situation in dealing with the excessive substance use of a close relation. Discussion The significance of producing a concise, psychometrically sound <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> for concerned and affected family members is discussed in the context of implications for research, theory, policy and practice in the field...|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to adapt}} a <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> – The Convoy of Social Support – to older persons in Brazil. Participants were 15 older persons (10 women and five men) {{selected}} from a larger sample of older persons (N = 81). The {{mean age of the}} participants was 69. 6 years old (SD = 7. 45). The diagram was individually applied. The Convoy of Social Support approach applied to older persons revealed itself as an easy and useful instrument to assess their social support network. An important aspect of it is that both structural and functional aspects of the social network are considered.

30|$|Articles {{were coded}} {{according}} to year of publication, responder/sample, sample size, disaster, <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measure,</b> outcome measure, and effect size. Responder types were clustered into five {{based on the}} number of studies: emergency medical responders; firefighters; police; rescue and recovery workers; and, others, which includes military responders and disaster responders that were aggregated (for example, combined police, firefighters, and emergency medical responders). Social support measures were then categorized according to the facet of support: general/undifferentiated social support, received social support, perceived social support, social support need, social support utilization, lack of support, and negative support. Measures of frequency of contact, time spent with others, and those that are relationship-based were coded as general/undifferentiated support. Social support-seeking and social-support coping were coded under support utilization. Outcomes were also coded as positive or negative psychological outcomes. Absence or reduction of negative outcomes/symptoms were coded as positive outcomes.|$|E

CF was measured by Compassion Satisfaction/Fatigue Self-Test for Helpers (Stamm 1995 - 1998), empathy was measured by Hogan Empathy Scale (HOS-R) (Greifand Hogan 1973), exposure was quantified as trauma work hours per week, and perceived <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> was designed {{for the purpose of}} this study. It was hypothesised that empathy would be a significant predictor of compassion fatigue, and that there may be differences in the predictive value of the analysed variables between clinicians and interpreters.

30|$|Unexpectedly, {{social support}} {{was not found}} to be a {{significant}} predictor in the regression analyses of either positive or negative affect. This is despite the fact that previous studies of affective quality have found social support to be a relatively robust predictor of affects (e.g., Fitzell and Pakenham 2010; Green et al. 2012). While the exact reason for this finding in the current undergraduate sample is not clear, {{it is possible that the}} issue might stem from the characteristics of the <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> used in the present research. For example, a previous study by Fitzell and Pakenham (2010) assessed participants’ social support in terms of both ‘availability’ and ‘satisfaction’ of support in predicting positive affect. The measure used in the current study, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (Zimet et al. 1988), however, assessed only the perceived ‘availability’ of social support by the participants. To help clarify this issue future research should employ social support scales with more nuanced dimensionalities in predicting affective quality in a similar sample population.|$|E

40|$|Examines {{whether the}} {{positive}} association between {{social support and}} well-being is attributable more to an overall beneficial effect of support (main- or direct-effect model) or to a process of support protecting persons from potentially adverse effects of stressful events (buffering model). The review of studies is organized according to (1) whether a measure assesses support structure (the existence of relationships) or function (the extent to which one 2 ̆ 7 s interpersonal relationships provide particular resources) and (2) the degree of specificity (vs globality) of the scale. Special attention is given to methodological characteristics that are requisite for a fair comparison of the models. It is concluded that there is evidence consistent with both models. Evidence for the buffering model is found when the <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> assesses the perceived availability of interpersonal resources that are responsive to the needs elicited by stressful events. Evidence for a main effect model is found when the support measure assesses a person 2 ̆ 7 s degree of integration in a large social network. Both conceptualizations of social support are correct in some respects, but each represents a different process through which social support may affect well-being.

40|$|Aims To {{describe}} {{the development of}} a questionnaire for assessment of the perceived functional social support needs of family members who have relatives with substance-related problems. To present preliminary evidence of its reliability and validity, thus completing the set of measures required to quantitatively assess the Stress-Strain-Coping-Support (SSCS) model of addiction and the family. Design A mixed methodological approach utilising interview, cross-sectional and repeated measurement data was adopted to operationalise social support specific to family members. Participants Adult family members affected by the problem alcohol or drug use of close relatives in the United Kingdom. Measurements A 75 -item self-completion Alcohol, Drugs and the Family Social Support Scale (ADF SSS) was developed from interview data, and piloted with 10 family members. The resultant 58 -item measure was subjected to psychometric testing with 132 family members, alongside qualitative feedback from 110. This led to a refined 25 -item questionnaire whose psychometric properties are described in this paper. Findings Preliminary findings on the 25 -item questionnaire indicate satisfactory levels of internal consistency for the overall measure (α= 0. 812) and each of the three constituent subscales: frequency of positively perceived general (α= 0. 913) and ADF specific (α= 0. 727) functional support and frequency of negatively perceived ADFrelated (α= 0. 851) functional support.

40|$|Resilience or {{the ability}} of an {{individual}} to maintain competence and attain adaptation despite negative life circumstances was explored in relation to transitional change in old age. Participants {{in the study were}} 155 older adults (106 women, 49 men) aged between 65 and 93, with an average age of 74 years. Measures used included the Resilience Scale, the SF- 36 Health Survey, the Self efficacy Scale, a <b>Social</b> <b>Support</b> <b>measure</b> and the Geriatric Coping Schedule. Women scored higher on resilience than men. There {{was no significant difference between}} the youngest old (65 - 70 years) and oldest old (86 to 93 years) in resilience scores. Resilience was significantly and positively correlated with self-efficacy. Interaction-term regression with the SF- 36 physical and mental health components as dependent variables, found significant main effects of resilience rather than adversity buffering effects. Findings from MANOVA indicated that those low on the resilience scale perceived their health to be worse than those high on the construct, reported having less vitality and perceived their health to limit role performance. MANOVA also revealed that those with high resilience engaged in more coping strategies both problem-focused and emotion-focused. Findings from one-way ANOVA indicated that older persons high on resilience tended to receive more emotional support from their social network. The findings have implications for the development of intervention programmes designed to enhance resilience and promote successful ageing in the elderly...|$|E

However, the social support literature is encumbered by a wide-spread inconsistency of social support measurement, with many studies not using existing validated measures. Identifying a valid <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> with clinical utility among veterans diagnosed with war-related (PTSD) would be a helpful resource for clinicians. Using data from 689 veterans seeking treatment from a VA PTSD program, the reliability, factor structure, and {{construct validity of the}} Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ; Sarason, Levine, Basham, & Sarason, 1983) were evaluated. The hypothesis of this study was based on the theoretical assumption that social support (as measured by the SSQ), would be inversely correlated with severity of PTSD symptoms (as measured by the Mississippi Scale for War-related PTSD; Keane, Caddell & Taylor, 1988) and depression (as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory; Beck, 1961). In this study, the SSQ scores were found to inversely correlate at a low, but statistically significant level, with both PTSD and depression scores. Principal axes factor analysis found that the two subscales of the SSQ were each measuring one factor. The correlation between the SSQ "N" scores and "s" scores suggest that these subscales are measuring different components of social support. Numerous implications for research and clinical practice are discussed.

They were given questionnaires on socio-demography, the Malay-versions of the MOS Social Support Survey, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the 21 -items Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). 30 of the women, who were bilingual, were also given the original English {{version of the}} instrument. A week later, these women were again given the Malay version of the MOS Social Support Survey. The scale displayed good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0. 93), parallel form reliability (0. 98) and test-retest reliability (0. 97) (Spearman’s rho; p< 0. 01). The negative correlations of the overall support index (total <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measure)</b> with the Malay versions of EPDS and BDI-II confirmed its validity. Extraction method of the 19 items (item 2 to item 20) from the MOS Social Support Survey using principle axis factoring with direct oblimin rotation converged into 3 dimensions of functional social support (informational, affectionate / positive social interaction and instrumental support) with reliability coefficients of 0. 91, 0. 83 and 0. 75 respectively.

40|$|Self-efficacy is {{considered}} to be a significant variable for enhancing all aspects of human performance (Druckman, 2004). Social support may influence self-efficacy through each of the four channels of self-efficacy information which consist of performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion and physiological responses (Bandura, 1997). The primary aim of this study was to explore and describe the nature of change that occurred in selfefficacy and received social support of university-age academy cricketers over the duration of an academy programme. The secondary aim was to explore and describe the relationship between the two constructs, self-efficacy and social support. Sixty-five male, university-age (18 - 25 years) provincial academy cricketers completed a <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> and a self-efficacy measure specifically designed for the purposes of this study. These measures were based on Rees and Freeman’s (2007) items and Cox, Martens and Russell’s (2003) revised Competitive State Anxiety Inventory- 2 (CSAI- 2 - Martens, Burton, Vealey, Bump & Smith, 1990) respectively. The perceived pre- and post-academy personal ratings of self-efficacy and social support, obtained prior to the start of the South African Interprovincial Academy Cricket week, referred to participants’ perceptions before and after attending their respective provincial academies. An inferential pre-experimental post-pretest design was used. The results included significant changes found in self-efficacy, esteem social support, informational social support and tangible social support over the academy season. There were no differences attributed to the length of time a cricketer had spent at the academy or to the cricketer’s highest level of achievement in cricket. The only significant correlation that existed between self-efficacy and social support was the correlation between self-efficacy and x informational social support.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Many divorcing persons turn to {{treatment}} programs hoping {{for assistance in}} managing the process of divorce. Treatment programs include individual as well as group process models. One {{of the goals of}} most group process programs is to generate peer support which in turn is hoped to facilitate the process of divorce adjustment. Evaluations of such programs are few and limited. This study is an evaluation of a group process divorce adjustment intervention entitled, Divorce Recovery Workshop. This intervention includes education and support components. Two different methods of workshop delivery are compared and analyzed to determine the influence of support on the process of divorce adjustment. One method includes a small group component, the other does not. This workshop, offered during 1992 / 3, drew participants from the greater Salem, Oregon area who had recently divorced. This study examines four areas of divorce adjustment, comparing the two methods of workshop delivery, as well as participant experiences of support. These four included depression, degree of control, self-esteem, and persistence of attachment. Participants were administered pre-workshop and post-workshop questionnaires. Standardized measures included the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (Radloff, 1977), the Rosenberg Scale (Rosenberg, 1965) for assessing self-esteem, and the Acceptance of Marital Termination Scale (Thompson and Spanier, 1983). Nonstandardized measures included the Degree of Control After Divorce Scale, the Support List adapted from a <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> (Bengtson and Mangen, 1988), the Support Scale adapted from a medical intervention peer support measure (Pratt, 1984), and a brief Satisfaction with Support Scale. This evaluation revealed positive outcomes for participants in the four areas of divorce adjustment regardless of method of program delivery. Participants also showed increased experiences of support attributable to the intervention. However, additional research is needed to establish the relationship between support and divorce adjustment. The lack of a control group should lead to caution to generalizing these results...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Both {{government}} and {{the health care industry}} are keenly aware of the burgeoning older adult population in Australia and globally. The risk for functional decline leading to placement in residential aged care is accentuated for older women who live alone, who may experience lower social support and/or touch deprivation. Frail older adults in one prior small qualitative study reported gains in functional ability after receiving Healing Touch treatments, while findings from two prior experimental studies with methodological limitations contributed suggestive but conflicting evidence for the benefit of Healing Touch on functional ability for hospice patients and women with cancer. The aim of this research was to clarify the existing evidence base with a methodologically rigorous placebo-controlled trial of adequate power to detect an effect on functional health. A series of weekly sessions of the complementary therapy of Healing Touch was provided in the homes of community-dwelling women to ascertain if this nursing intervention, which uses gentle direct and indirect touch on specific locations of the body in a prescribed sequence for each technique, could assist them in managing and optimising their current functional and global health status, as well as providing them with a source of healthy touch and social connection. TRIAL DESIGN: A parallel, two-arm randomised placebo-controlled trial was conducted to assess the effects of the energy-based complementary therapy of Healing Touch on the functional, social, psychological and spiritual health status and overall quality of life of community dwelling older women. METHODS: Participants/Setting: Inclusion criteria: women over 65 living alone in the community in a regional city in northern Australia in houses, units or retirement villas, who were receiving some assistance in their homes from any source including family, friends, neighbours or volunteers. Exclusion criteria were existing cognitive impairment, the presence of a room-mate or live-in caregiver, or recent experiences with Healing Touch or other similar energy-based touch therapies. Participants received a series of weekly treatments of Healing Touch or mimic healing touch (placebo) in their residences between January 2009 and December 2010. A Research Assistant blinded to group allocation collected the data in the participants' residences at baseline (Week 0), at completion of the seven week treatment series (Week 8), and six months after completion of the treatment series (Week 33). Interventions: Participants in the Healing Touch group received a series of seven weekly treatments, each lasting an average of 30 minutes, consisting of one of 35 possible Healing Touch techniques, from the established curriculum taught by the Colorado Center for Healing Touch and approved by the American Holistic Nurses Association. Timing and duration of sessions were similar for the participants in the placebo group, who received one mimic healing touch technique as per the placebo protocol developed by the Principal Investigator(PI). The PI delivered all interventions to preserve blinding and ensure protocol adherence. Hypothesis: The Healing Touch group will experience statistically significantly smaller declines in functional health than the placebo group. Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was functional health as measured by the Older American Resources Survey’s Functional Multidimensional Assessment Questionnaire (OARS-FMAQ), consisting of two sub-scales: Basic Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and Instrumental ADLs, which are summed for a Total ADL score. Secondary outcome measures included the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS), the Paloutzian and Ellis Spiritual Well-Being Scale, the Ryff Psychological Well-Being Scale-short form, and the Duke Health Profile. Randomisation: Computer generated random numbers were used to create a sequence of blocked and balanced random allocations, in groups of ten, concealed in opaque envelopes. Participants were advised of the placebo design prior to consent. Envelopes were opened by the PI immediately prior to administering the selected protocol at the first treatment session. Blinding: Participants, family members, referral sources, co-providers, data collectors and data analysis verifiers were blinded to group allocation. RESULTS: Number of participants: 191 women were screened and enrolled, but 18 did not keep their appointments and 5 failed their screening MMSE, leaving 168 who progressed to randomisation: 84 participants in each treatment group. Attrition causes included: onset of illness (5); death (1); relocation (4); too busy for appointments (1) or participants being unable to tolerate lying on the massage table and/or wearing the sleeping mask (4). A modified intention-to-treat analysis was conducted for the 153 participants with data from all three time points, regardless of protocol adherence: 75 participants in the placebo group and 78 in the Healing Touch group. Outcome Measures: Despite randomisation, treatment groups were not comparable on the key demographic variable of living arrangement, with a greater number of retirement village residents in the Healing Touch group, thus requiring a stratified analysis. For the stratum of participants already living in retirement villages, there was a statistically significant difference (p = 0. 025) between the change in the Healing Touch group's scores from Week 0 to Week 33 as compared to the change in the placebo group's scores, on the Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADL) sub-scale. The Healing Touch group showed a small but clinically relevant improvement in the BADL sub-scale (median 0. 0, inter-quartile range 0. 0, + 1. 0), while the placebo group showed a small but clinically relevant decline (median 0. 0, inter-quartile range - 1. 0, 0. 0). The change over time in the two other measures of functional health, the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) sub-scale and the Total ADL scale, were comparable between the Healing Touch group and the placebo group for the retirement village stratum; and all functional health measures (BADL, IADL, and Total ADL) were comparable between the two treatment groups for the stratum of participants living in their own homes or units in ordinary residential neighbourhoods. The <b>Social</b> <b>Support</b> <b>measure</b> also showed a statistically significant difference (p = 0. 012) between treatment groups, but only in the stratum of participants still living in their own homes or units in ordinary residential neighbourhoods. Again the Healing Touch group showed a modest improvement from Week 0 to Week 33, while the placebo group showed a decline. Harms: No harms related to the treatment were reported, although alternative positions in a reclining chair or shorter treatments were required for 4 participants who could not tolerate lying supine on the massage table for a full treatment session. CONCLUSION: Healing Touch may have a beneficial effect for selected older adult populations on selected health dimensions, depending on their area of deficit: 1. Retirement village residents may respond with improvements in their functional health. These findings are congruent with some of the earlier qualitative and experimental research on functional health, but conflict with more recent RCTs with younger but acutely ill participants. 2. Socially isolated residents in ordinary residential neighbourhoods may respond with improvements in their social health. These findings conflict with earlier studies of younger but acutely ill participants, where no benefits for social health were observed.

40|$|Background In {{chronic illness}} self-care, <b>social</b> <b>support</b> may {{influence}} some health behaviors more than others. Purpose Examine <b>social</b> <b>support's</b> association with seven individual chronic illness self-management behaviors: two healthy "lifestyle" behaviors (physical activity, diet) and five more highly skilled and diabetes-specific (medical) behaviors (checking feet, oral medication adherence, insulin adherence, self-monitored blood glucose, primary care appointment attendance). Methods Using cross-sectional administrative and survey data from 13, 366 patients with type 2 diabetes, Poisson regression models estimated the adjusted relative risks (ARR) of practicing each behavior at higher vs {{lower levels of}} <b>social</b> <b>support.</b> Results Higher emotional <b>support</b> and <b>social</b> network scores {{were significantly associated with}} increased ARR of both lifestyle behaviors. Both <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> were also associated with increased ARR for checking feet. Neither measure was significantly associated with other medical behaviors. Conclusions Findings suggest that <b>social</b> <b>support</b> diminished in importance as self-care progresses from lifestyle to more skilled "medical" behaviors. © 2014 The Society of Behavioral Medicine (outside the USA) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>social</b> <b>support</b> and depression has impli-cations for researchers studying schizophrenia. In this article, the authors attempt to conceptualize <b>social</b> <b>support</b> {{and assess the}} re-liability and validity of its various measures. They then evaluate the ability of <b>social</b> <b>support,</b> along with stressors, to explain psy-chiatric symptoms. Representative data from a community survey of. adults, ages 17 - 70, suggest that <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> show strong relationships to depression and other psychiatric symptoms. The implications {{of these and other}} findings for the study of schizophrenia are discussed. The concept of <b>social</b> <b>support</b> has become a focal point in research for its potential contribution to the epidemiological explanation of ill-ness. This is especially evident {{within the framework of the}} stressor-illness model. In this model, the {{relationship between}} stressors—usually measured with a stressful life events scale—and certain forms of illness—especially psychiatric symptoms and depression—has been well documented (Dohrenwend and Dohrenwend 1974). To a lesser ex-tent, this relationship has also been demonstrated for schizo-phrenic patients (Brown and Birle...|$|R
40|$|Workplace <b>social</b> <b>support</b> {{has been}} found to be linked to various {{beneficial}} employee and organizational outcomes. Some research has been successful in more deeply characterizing <b>social</b> <b>support</b> by dividing it into its constituent parts such as source of support and content of <b>support.</b> Dividing <b>social</b> <b>support</b> into emotional support (such as sympathy, understanding, and caring) and instrumental support (providing job-related assistance) is increasingly commonly practiced, but their contributions to important outcomes is still unclear. Using the theoretical framework of the specificity hypothesis, it was predicted that instrumental and emotional <b>social</b> <b>support</b> are highly correlated and have unique associations with outcome variables when controlling for each other. Metaanalysis and meta-regression using correlations from 73 independent samples found that emotional and instrumental support are indeed highly correlated and do contribute uniquely to work stressors, affective strain, and job performance outcomes. This finding provides some support for the specificity hypothesis of <b>social</b> <b>support.</b> Practitioners would do well to target their type of support to the demands at hand, and researchers would do well to use <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> most appropriate to the outcomes of interest...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{investigated}} whether different alcoholism treatment approaches differen-tially impact <b>social</b> <b>support</b> scores in individuals with concurrent alcohol dependence and social phobia. Method: Individuals (N = 397) were selected retrospectively {{from a larger}} pool of par-ticipants enrolled in a multisite randomized clinical trial on treatment matching. Three standard treatments were delivered over 12 weeks: Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Twelve Step Facilitation Therapy (TSF), and Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET). <b>Social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> were analyzed to test the effects of treatment group and gender. Results: For men, there was significant improvement on two <b>measures</b> of <b>social</b> <b>support</b> regardless of treatment group. Women who received CBT or TSF had better support outcomes than women who received MET. Conclusions: These data suggest that <b>social</b> <b>support</b> can be improved through alcohol treatment in individuals with coexisting social phobia, particularly if social workers emphasize skills training and facilitating involvement in 12 -step groups. Social relationships and <b>social</b> <b>support</b> networks significantly impact both physical and psychological well-being. Results of early {{work in this area}} show that individuals who have <b>social</b> <b>support</b> are in better health than are those with fewer supportive contacts (Broadhead et al., 1983; Cohen & Wills...|$|R
40|$|Background—The {{increasing}} rate of comorbid {{posttraumatic stress}} and depressive symptoms among young adults presents a unique symptom presentation and challenges to treatment. The current study examined psychosocial barriers [...] {{external locus of}} control [...] and facilitators [...] <b>social</b> <b>support</b> [...] in the posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms association. Methods—The current cross-sectional study was conducted among 701 Jamaican university participants, ages 18 – 30 years. Participants completed self-report measures of general demographic information as well as target variables which include the CES-D- 10, Sense of control (external and internal locus of control), Short screening scale for DSM-IV posttraumatic stress disorder and <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measures.</b> Results—Majority of the sample was female (76. 2 %; n= 534); and slightly {{more than half of the}} sample self-identified as Black/African ancestry (59. 7 %). External locus of control (LOC) partially mediated the relationship between posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms, {{external locus of control}} (LOC) had a greater mediation magnitude than <b>social</b> <b>support</b> in the posttraumatic stress-depressive symptoms association (Indirect Effect= 0. 133, 95 % CI- 0. 075...|$|R
40|$|There is {{considerable}} evidence {{that people with}} disability are at a heightened likelihood of experiencing disadvantage in many facets of life. A greater likelihood of disadvantage may in turn {{increase the risk of}} exclusion from a range of opportunities, including social participation. However, factors that may lead to 'double disadvantage' among people with disability-such as living outside major cities-have not been well assessed in Australia in relation to social connectedness. The current study compared various socioeconomic, life satisfaction, community participation and <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> among prime working age regional people with and with no disability. People with disability experienced greater relative disadvantage and reported lower levels of perceived <b>social</b> <b>support</b> compared with people with no disability. Irrespective of disability status, men in regional Australia reported lower levels of <b>social</b> <b>support</b> than women. However, engagement in community activities such as volunteering did not differ as a function of disability status. This in turn suggests potential avenues for consideration in terms of strengthening social connectedness among regional people with disability, and addressing the risk of social exclusion for this group.

40|$|A new scale (The Changing Moods Scale, Austin, unpublished) is {{validated}} to add {{to growing}} research that sees emotional intelligence as having a dark side rather than purely being of prosocial usage. The scale {{was found to have}} four principal factors (Reassurance, Emotional Machiavellianism, Emotional Concealment and Morally-Negative Manipulation). Although positive emotional manipulation was found to correlate positively with emotional intelligence, whilst negative emotional manipulation correlated weakly, this does not damage the case for the dark side of emotional intelligence as positive manipulation may be used for darker purposes. In conjunction with personality, emotional intelligence and <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measures,</b> the Changing Moods Scale was found to suggest that Emotional Machiavellianism is Alexithymic in nature and people who use positive mood manipulation were more likely to perceive <b>social</b> <b>support</b> (those who concealed their emotions felt less supported). Males scored lower on the Reassurance factor and higher on the Emotional Machiavellianism factor than females, but there were no other significant gender differences...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis presented {{an investigation of}} adolescent help-seeking behaviour {{that is likely to}} inform future studies examining adolescent psychology. Few prior studies have examined the factor structures of typical <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> to examine whether family help-seeking and family support are single constructs or can be conceptualised as separate constructs. This three-year longitudinal study investigated the temporal characteristics and psychosocial consequences of early adolescent help-seeking behaviour. Findings highlighted that family help-seeking can be measured separately from family support, and discussed the role of family help-seeking and support in reducing adverse outcomes (e. g. mental health problems, school disengagement) for adolescents. The discussion contends there is interplay between family help-seeking and family support; however, the two constructs represent separate components within an over-arching adaptive process, and should be conceptualised and measured in this manner...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the life satisfaction of older adults and the <b>social</b> <b>support</b> from grandchildren in Hong Kong. Two hundred and fifteen older people (from the ages of 64 to 101, mean age 79. 3), whose youngest grandchild was aged 12 or older, were recruited from elderly service agencies to participate in the study. Face-to-face interviews were conducted by trained interviewers using a standardized questionnaire, which included the Life Satisfaction Scale for Chinese, the Lubben Social Network Scale, the Chinese Tradition Scale, grandchildren <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measures,</b> self-rated health, self-rated financial adequacy, and demographic variables. Hierarchical regression showed that the life satisfaction of older adults benefitted significantly from the <b>social</b> <b>support</b> from grandchildren (R 2 change =. 05, Fchange = 7. 15, p <. 001); while controlling demographic characteristics, general <b>social</b> <b>support,</b> attitude towards Chinese tradition, self-rated health, and self-rated financial adequacy. The total explained variance was 51 %. Emotional support and appraisal support from grandchildren were identified as significant contributing factors. The policy and practice implications for active aging policies are discussed in a Chinese context. Springer Science+Business Media B. V. 2009. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Introduction & Objective: {{previous}} {{studies suggest that}} satisfactory <b>social</b> <b>support</b> leads to physical health and psychological well-being. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the gender differences in relation betweens different dimensions of perceived <b>social</b> <b>support</b> and different aspects of well-being in Iranian University Students. Materials & Methods: This analytical study was conducted, using three different groups of students. Students were selected among the students of Tehran University and Allame Tabatabayi university, in 2007. Students were asked to complete perceived <b>social</b> <b>support,</b> positive affect, negative affect, life satisfaction, and psychological and social well-being scales. All the students voluntarily completed and returned the questionnaire. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data using SPSS software. Results: It was found that, <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> are better predictors for life satisfaction and affect balance in girls compared with boys. Moreover, perceived <b>social</b> <b>support</b> from family plays a more important role in girls when it comes to prediction of psychological and social well-being. In contrast, perceived <b>social</b> <b>support</b> from friends plays the same role in boys. Finally, perceived <b>social</b> <b>support</b> from special person and colleagues’ faculty can not significantly predict aspects of well-being. Conclusion: there were gender differences in addition to similarities in the relation between aspects of perceived <b>social</b> <b>support</b> and aspects of well-being. Some aspects of perceived <b>social</b> <b>support</b> predict well-being better in boys and some others are better for prediction of well-being in girls...|$|R
