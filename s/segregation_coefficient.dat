5000|$|Because {{impurities}} dissolve {{differently in}} silicon and oxide, a growing oxide will selectively take up or reject dopants. This redistribution {{is governed by}} the <b>segregation</b> <b>coefficient,</b> which determines how strongly the oxide absorbs or rejects the dopant, and the diffusivity.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} {{is that the}} <b>segregation</b> <b>coefficient</b> k (the ratio of an impurity in the solid phase {{to that in the}} liquid phase) is usually less than one. Therefore, at the solid/liquid boundary, the impurity atoms will diffuse to the liquid region. Thus, by passing a crystal boule through a thin section of furnace very slowly, such that only a small region of the boule is molten at any time, the impurities will be segregated {{at the end of the}} crystal. Because of the lack of impurities in the leftover regions which solidify, the boule can grow as a perfect single crystal if a seed crystal is placed at the base to initiate a chosen direction of crystal growth. When high purity is required, such as in semiconductor industry, the impure end of the boule is cut off, and the refining is repeated.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{study of}} sexual {{segregation}} has received increasing attention {{over the last}} two decades. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the existence of sexual segregation, such as the ''predation risk hypothesis,'' the ''forage selection hypothesis,'' and the ''activity budget hypothesis. '' Testing which hypothesis drives sexual segregation is hampered, however, by the lack of consensus regarding a formal measurement of sexual segregation. By using a derivation of the well-known chi-square (here called the sexual segregation and aggregation statistic [SSAS]) instead of existent <b>segregation</b> <b>coefficients,</b> we offer a reliable way to test for temporal variation in the occurrence of sexual segregation and aggregation, even in cases where a large proportion of animals are observed alone. A randomization procedure provides a test for the null hypothesis of independence of the distributions of males and females among the groups. The usefulness of SSAS in the study of sexual segregation is demonstrated with three case studies on ungulate populations belonging to species with contrasting life histories and annual grouping patterns (isard, red deer, and roe deer). The existent <b>segregation</b> <b>coefficients</b> were unreliable since, for a given value, sexual segregation could or could not occur. Similarly, the existent <b>segregation</b> <b>coefficients</b> performed badly when males and females aggregated. The new SSAS was not prone to such limitations and allowed clear conclusions regarding whether males and females segregate, aggregate, or simply mix at random applicable to all species...|$|R
