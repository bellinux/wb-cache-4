5|$|According to plan, the Syrians {{attacked}} {{from the}} southern Golan Heights, {{just south of the}} Sea of Galilee through al-Hama and the Yarmouk River, hitting a densely populated Jewish area of settlement. This came as a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Haganah, which expected an attack from south Lebanon and Mishmar HaYarden. The Jewish villages on the original confrontation line were Ein Gev, Masada, Sha'ar HaGolan and both Deganias.|$|E

5|$|Further {{attacks were}} {{conducted}} against Saipan during late November {{in an attempt}} to disrupt the American offensive. On November24, Marianas-based B-29s conducted their first raid against Japan, bombing targets in and around Tokyo. Three days later the Japanese mounted two raids against their bases. During the early hours of November27, two G4Ms flying from Iwo Jima struck Isley Field from low altitude and escaped after destroying one B-29 and damaging eleven others. This attack came as a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Americans, and construction lights were still on at Isley {{at the start of the}} raid.|$|E

5|$|In {{the battles}} of Modrica and Meçad 7,000 Ottoman forces were left {{dead on the}} {{battlefield}} along with thousands of horses. The Albanians had suffered 1,000 casualties themselves and, in their exhaustion, they refused to pursue the fleeing Ottoman forces. Hamza Pasha and his staff were ransomed to the sultan. Raimon d'Ortafà reported Skanderbeg's victory to Alfonso who received it with great exuberance. Skanderbeg's victory over a ruler even more powerful than Murad came as a great <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Albanians. Skanderbeg's reputation among his allies was redeemed and the Dukagjini opted for a reconciliation.|$|E
5|$|The {{announcement}} that Portal 2 {{would be available}} on PlayStation 3 came as a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> industry because Gabe Newell had criticized that console in the past, citing difficulties in the port of The Orange Box. The move toward the PlayStation 3 {{was a result of}} growing frustration with Microsoft's policies for Xbox 360 content, including the difficulty of pushing patching and new content to players. Newell saw Sony's publication model as more open, allowing Steam-like features to be used on the console. Portal 2 was the first PlayStation 3 game to support a subset of features from Steamworks, including automatic updates, downloadable content, and community support. The game supports cross-platform play between the PlayStation 3, Windows, and OS X versions.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 2 passed {{closer to}} Enceladus (87,010km) on August 26, 1981, {{allowing}} higher-resolution images to be obtained. These images showed a young surface. They also revealed a surface with different regions with vastly different surface ages, with a heavily cratered mid- to high-northern latitude region, and a lightly cratered region {{closer to the}} equator. This geologic diversity contrasts with the ancient, heavily cratered surface of Mimas, another moon of Saturn slightly smaller than Enceladus. The geologically youthful terrains came as a great <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scientific community, because no theory was then able to predict that such a small (and cold, compared to Jupiter's highly active moon Io) celestial body could bear signs of such activity.|$|E

5|$|Following its May 1943 {{debut in}} action, {{during the second}} half of 1943, Schnaufer and his crew began experimenting with {{upward-firing}} autocannons, dubbed Schräge Musik. This allowed the night fighter to approach and attack the bombers from below—outside the enemy crew's usual field of view. An attack by a Schräge Musik-equipped night fighter typically came as a complete <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bomber crew, who realised a night fighter was close by only when they came under fire. It is not exactly known when Schnaufer's Bf 110 was equipped with Schräge Musik. Rumpelhardt stated that the weapons system was installed prior to his return from officer training. It is also not exactly known how many of his victories had been claimed using the upwards firing cannons. According to Fritz Engau, who had known Schnaufer since Flugzeugführerschule C 3, 20 to 30 of Schnaufer's aerial victories had been claimed using upwards firing guns.|$|E
5|$|Neither the mutiny nor {{the popular}} {{uprising}} came entirely as a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French authorities. The colonial government's first large scale crackdown on the VNQDD in 1929 had substantially damaged the party, which had modelled {{itself on the}} Chinese Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek. The crackdown also {{had the effect of}} increasing the violent tendencies within what remained of the VNQDĐ. Its remaining leadership was now willing to intensify preparations for a violent overthrow of colonial rule to create an independent Vietnamese republic. Most of the party's leadership ranks, but not its lower-ranking members and affiliates, seem to have concluded that they were too weak and too closely spied on by the Sûreté to have a meaningful chance of success. At the most optimistic, they could hope to trigger a spontaneous uprising; at the worst, the subsequent French reprisals would transform them into anti-colonial martyrs. Finally, there was disagreement or a communication problem over the timing of the insurrection: after Hoc had ordered the postponement of the mutiny, Nhu still proceeded.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{victory at}} Unsan {{was as much}} of a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chinese {{leadership}} as it was to the UN forces. The accidental encounter between the Chinese and US forces at Unsan eased the fear of the Chinese leadership about intervening in Korea, while the performance of the US 1st Cavalry Division was studied in great detail by Chinese commanders. For the UN forces, on the other hand, despite the heavy losses suffered by the US Eighth Army at Unsan, the unexpected Chinese withdrawal made the United Nations Command believe that China did not intervene in Korea on a large scale. PVA Commander Peng Dehuai incorporated the lessons from Unsan for the upcoming Second Phase Campaign, while General Douglas MacArthur launched the Home-by-Christmas Offensive under the assumption that only a weak Chinese force was present in Korea, resulting in the decisive battles at the Ch'ongch'on River and the Chosin Reservoir later that year.|$|E

25|$|The Baathist coup of 8 February 1963 {{came as no}} <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Communists, {{but they}} were unable to {{mobilize}} their supporters in the armed forces to oppose it effectively. Al-Radi reacted immediately by drawing up an appeal for mass resistance to the coup, and Communist supporters defended poorer districts of Baghdad against the new government until 10 February, suffering heavy losses.|$|E
25|$|The {{attack on}} 22 June 1941 {{came as a}} {{complete}} <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet High Command. Unprepared, the Red Air Force lost enormous numbers of aircraft on the ground. Many of the Red Air Force pilots had not been trained properly on the fighters they were allocated, making missions less effective. The situation was so one-sided that some Soviet pilots resorted to ramming German aircraft if they could.|$|E
40|$|Using {{a unique}} dataset on Brazilian nominal and real yield curves {{combined}} with daily survey forecasts of macroeconomic {{variables such as}} GDP growth, inflation, and exchange rate movements, we identify <b>the</b> effect of <b>surprises</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Brazilian interbank target rate on expected future nominal and real short rates, term premia, and inflation expectations. We find that positive <b>surprises</b> <b>to</b> target rates lead to higher expected nominal and real interest rates and reduced nominal and inflation term premia. We also find a strongly positive relation between both real and nominal term premia and measures of dispersion in survey forecasts. Uncertainty about future exchange rates is a particularly important driver of variations in Brazilian term premia...|$|R

25|$|The {{conflict}} between the Communist Party of Germany and the Social Democratic Party of Germany fundamentally contributed {{to the demise of}} the Weimar Republic. It is, however, disputed whether Hitler's seizure of power came as a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> USSR. Some authors claim that Stalin deliberately aided Hitler's rise by directing the policy of the Communist Party of Germany on a suicidal course in order to foster an inter-imperialist war, a theory dismissed by many others.|$|E
25|$|In July 2005, Formula One driver Damon Hill {{appeared}} on the show {{for the first time}} as the star.

Since Mansell's appearance the Liana has remained in use as a vehicle reserved for Formula 1 drivers.|$|E

Allegiant announced on August 22, 2006, {{that they would}} cut ties with the airport, citing high fuel costs and passenger loads in the 80% range {{as the reason for}} departure. The departure came as a huge <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city as service was reported to be going great throughout Allegiant's entire tenure at the airport.|$|E

Russia did not grant him sanctuary. On November 14, 1999, Öcalan arrived in Rome, Italy accompanied by Ramon Mantovani, a member of the Communist Refoundation Party, from Moscow. His arrival was a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Italian government, which had not been notified, and an international crisis began as Turkey requested Öcalan's extradition.|$|E
25|$|On March 6, 1939, {{she flew}} out of Spain under enemy naval fire to the major Algerian port city of Oran then under French sovereignty. Her arrival came as a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> authorities, who hurriedly put her aboard a liner bound for Marseille. The ship's captain was a Nationalist sympathizer, but a clandestine Communist cell aboard ship made sure {{that he did not}} steer the ship toward Nationalist-held Barcelona. This was the third time that Ibárruri had evaded capture by the Nationalist.|$|E
25|$|The {{first phase}} of Silver Fox was {{launched}} on 22 June 1941, {{to coincide with the}} launch of the general German offensive, Operation Barbarossa. The two divisions of Mountain Corps Norway moved out from Kirkenes to the east and began deploying in the Finnish held area around Petsamo. The appearance of a German corps on their border came as a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Russians. The operation was successful and the nickel mines were secured. Dietl's troops reorganized and prepared for the launch of Platinum Fox. In the South, the units of Feige's XXXVI Corps prepared for their attack at Salla.|$|E
