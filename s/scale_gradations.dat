40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDFramed by the South African {{imperative}} of widening epistemological access to undergraduate science studies, this research {{takes the form}} of a case study to investigate the educational affordances of an extended introductory physics course. Using theoretical tools from Legitimation Code Theory (LCT) (Maton, 2014 a) – in particular, semantic gravity and semantic density – the study characterizes the pedagogical practices and student learning in this Extended course, in relation to a Mainstream course in the same Physics Department. Data was collected through classroom observations, observations of student groups working on Mechanics physics tasks, and interviews with students. Two external languages of description were developed in order to translate between the LCT concepts of semantic gravity and semantic density and the empirical data from the physics context. The first language of description was used to characterize the semantic shifts in pedagogical practices, using a Concrete-Linking-Abstract continuum. The second language of description drew on physics education research on representations (Knight, 2007; Van Heuvelen, 1991 a) tasks. Semantic profiles (Maton, 2013) were then constructed to show the semantic shifts in the pedagogical practices and in lecturers’ and students’ approaches to physics tasks. The study has shown that the extra curriculum time enabled different pedagogical practices. The Extended course showed a steady progression in pacing, initially with a less compressed semantic profile, while the Mainstream course showed a consistent compression. The Extended course showed a greater prevalence of the Linking level, with more time spent at the Concrete level and greater semantic flow. The courses also exhibited different communicative approaches, with students in the Extended course more engaged in making the semantic shifts together with the lecturer. The Extended course used more real-life illustrations as a starting point, whereas the Mainstream course tended to use verbal problem statements. Looking particularly at how problem tasks were dealt with, the study suggested that the lecturers’ pedagogical practices in dealing with physics tasks influenced the way in which the students tackled these tasks. The semantic profiles showed a more rapid shift up the semantic continuum in the Mainstream pedagogy and student work, while in the Extended pedagogy and student work, the semantic profiles indicated that more time was spent initially unpacking the concrete problem situation and explicitly shifting up and down the semantic continuum. In terms of methodological contribution, this study has demonstrated the usefulness of LCT tools for characterizing pedagogical practices and student learning in a physics context. Furthermore, the study has linked LCT to physics education literature and to research on epistemological access and academic literacies in a novel way. It has modified Maton’s form of semantic profiling, through introducing the following: a more detailed time <b>scale,</b> <b>gradations</b> of semantic strength on the semantic continuum, and coding for interactive engagement in pedagogical practices. The study thus has important implications for how curriculum and pedagogical practices might better support epistemological access to disciplinary knowledge in the field of physics, not only at the Extended course level but for introductory physics courses more generally...|$|E

60|$|The first {{object of}} the policy of this act was to improve the {{constitution}} of the Court of Proprietors. In this case, as in almost all the rest, the remedy was not applied directly to the disease. The complaint was, that factions in the Court of Proprietors had shown, in several instances, a disposition to support the servants of the Company against the just coercion and legal prosecution of the Directors. Instead of applying a corrective to the distemper, a change was proposed in the constitution. By this reform, it was presumed that an interest would arise in the General Court more independent in itself, and more connected with the commercial prosperity of the Company. Under the new constitution, no proprietor, not possessed of a thousand pounds capital stock, was permitted to vote in the General Court: before the act, five hundred pounds was a sufficient qualification for one vote; and no value gave more. But as the lower classes were disabled, the power was increased in the higher: proprietors of three thousand pounds were allowed two votes; those of six thousand were entitled to three; ten thousand pounds was made the qualification for four. The votes were thus regulated in the <b>scale</b> and <b>gradation</b> of property. On this scale, and on some provisions to prevent occasional qualifications and splitting of votes, the whole reformation rested.|$|R

From smart toasters and smart shoes to smart toys and smart buildings, ubicomp describes user experiences which are both big and small and which operate at {{a wide variety of}} <b>scales</b> and <b>gradations</b> in between. However, existing research in new media studies and human computer interaction does not adequately address this question of scale in relation to ubiquitous computing. In this thesis, I propose a more robust theoretical framework I call "network design. " It argues that differently scaled ubicomp systems have their own potentials and challenges, histories and precedents, material affordances and ethical implications. This thesis identifies and analyzes the operation of ubiquitous computing networks at three scales: the body scale, the architectural scale and the urban scale. The case studies for each chapter, respectively, include: exercise wristwatches and quantified self literature, responsive environments like smart homes and smart offices, and smart city initiatives dealing with sensors placed in urban infrastructure. In each scale, I identify common characteristics of that scale, historical precedents, as well what happens when this particular kind of network "scales up" or "scales down. " Thus, although I am interested in describing the unique characteristics of differently scaled ubicomp networks, I am also interested in describing situations when scales interact. by Jason Martin Lipshin.

Dysplastic lesions have been classified microscopically according to degree of cytologic atypia and changes in architectural patterns, usually on a three part or four part <b>gradation</b> <b>scale.</b> Vocal cord epithelial lesions are graded according to either the Ljubljana or the World Health Organization (WHO) system whereas oral dysplasias are generally classified according to WHO criteria. Cytologically atypical cells are considered to represent precancerous changes predicting an increase risk for carcinomatous transformation. Inter- and intra-rater reliability studies among pathologists have disclosed low correlation coefficients for four part grading systems, whereas improved agreement is achieved (kappa correlation values) using the Ljubljana systems. Evidence forwarded by some studies supports the prognostic value of progressively severe dysplastic changes for carcinomatous transformation; however, some studies indicate {{that the presence of}} a clinically defined lesion without microscopic evidence of dysplasia also connotes increased risk for carcinomatous transformation.

Many factors such as stress, anxiety, depression, negative thoughts, unhealthy life style, unwholesome diet etc., disturb mental and physical wellbeing. Senile dementia is the mental deterioration, i. e, loss of intellectual ability associated with old age. It causes progressive deterioration of mental faculties, e. g., memory, intellect, attention, thinking, comprehension and personality, with preservation of normal level of consciousness. Two major types of senile dementia have been identified, namely that due to generalized atrophy in the cortical {{area of the brain}} (Alzheimer's type) and that due to vascular disorders mainly due to stroke. According to DSM-IV (diagnostic {{and statistical manual of mental}} disorders), the essential feature of dementia is the development of multiple cognitive deficits that include memory impairment and at least one of the following cognitive disturbances such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or a disturbance in executive function. For the present study, a standardized questionnaire in the form of proforma incorporating types of foods (madhura, amla and lavana rasayukta ahara etc.) and life style (divaswapna, ratrijagarana and manasika bhavas etc) is prepared. To assess manasika bhava, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Brief Psychiatry Rating <b>Scale,</b> and standardized <b>gradations</b> of anumana pariksha of manasika bhavas mentioned by Charaka at Vimana Sthana 4 / 8 were adopted.

Now, the scenario has changed in the global context and large <b>scale</b> technological up <b>gradations</b> have taken place, which are both cost effective and technologically advanced. In that context, this study investigates the feasibility of implementing Active network sharing in Sri Lankan telecommunication industry to drive the industry forward. The broader objectives of the study are, (1) Identifying the drivers, barriers and benefits to be considered (2) Proposing appropriate regulatory policies and (3) Formulating the best Active network sharing business model for Sri Lanka. The development of this dissertation is mainly based on the information gathered through interviews and questionnaire survey from main stake holders of the industry namely, Telecommunication operators, Telecommunication equipment vendors and Regulatory commission. Middle managers and senior managers in nine telecommunication operators, experts in vendor organizations and regulatory officers were surveyed. The obtained raw data were analysed in a structured way. Both quantitative and qualitative methods have been employed in the analysis and several broad conclusions could be drawn. It has identified three main drivers, six main barriers and four main benefits related to Active network sharing. It also proposes appropriate regulatory policies to encourage Active network sharing in Sri Lanka. Ultimately the study comes up with a suitable business model for implementation of Active infrastructure sharing in Sri Lanka by engaging the STOF model as the base model.

40|$|The intrathecally {{administered}} morphine offers {{powerful and}} lingering postoperative analgesia. Today it is applied widely for relief of postoperative pain associated with crowd of surgical interventions. The most common {{side effects of}} intrathecally administered morphine are pruritus with reported frequency between 60 % and 100 %, followed by postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) with a reported incidence between 30 and 50 %. The intrathecal morphine induced pruritus because of its central mechanism is resistant to treatment with usual antipruritic drugs. Nonetheless, successful treatment of intrathecal morphine induced pruritus with opioid antagonists is accompanied with reversal of postoperative analgesia. Antagonists of subtype 3 receptors of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) - 5 -ΗΤ 3 antagonists are central acting antiemetic drugs. The 5 -ΗΤ 3 antagonists are indicated in patients whose postoperative analgesia is based on intrathecal morphine because this kind of analgesia is associated with increased risk of PONV. Administration of ondansetron, a 5 -ΗΤ 3 antagonist, was reported by three authors as effective preventive antipruritic measure for intrathecal morphine induced pruritus. As 5 -ΗΤ 3 antagonists do not affect patients’ awareness and postoperative analgesia and their side effects in usual doses for PONV prevention are very rare they approach the ideal drug for prevention of intrathecal morphine pruritus. However antipruritic efficacy for other 5 -ΗΤ 3 antagonists did not reported until now, as result from our research in pubmed database. So we deigned and performed a double blind, controlled clinical study in effectiveness of four 5 -ΗΤ 3 antagonists (ondansetron, dolasetron, granisetron and tropisetron) in prevention of intrathecal morphine induced pruritus. In our study were included 200 patients underwent surgical procedures with spinal anaesthesia with addition of 0, 25 mg morphine for postoperative analgesia. Patients were randomly allocated in five groups of 40 patients to receive placebo (group P), or 5 -ΗΤ 3 antagonists in i. v. doses indicated for prevention of PONV (ondansetron 8 mg group O, dolasetron 12, 5 mg -group D, granisetron 3 mg -group G and tropisetron 5 mg - group T). Patients with contraindication for spinal anaesthesia or any drug {{included in the study}} were excluded from the study. Patients with diseases associated with pruritus or which received drugs modifying pruritus were also excluded. Spinal anesthesia was performed with hyperbaric bupivacaine 0, 5 % 12, 5 mg to 17, 5 mg plus 0, 25 mg preservative free morphine. The patients were followed intraoperatively and during the first 24 postoperative hours, data collection was performed immediately after end of surgery in postanesthesia care unit and in surgical ward at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively by a blinded resident anesthesiologist. Severity of pruritus was evaluated and recorded in ordinal scale 0 - no pruritus, 1 - mild pruritus, 2 - moderate pruritus, 3 - severe pruritus. The patients with severe pruritus were treated with nalbouphine 3 mg i. v. Postoperative nausea and vomiting were recorded with the following scale 0 - no nausea, 1 - mild nausea, 2 - moderate nausea, 3 severe nausea or episode of vomiting.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{a special kind of}} {{comparative}} without an overt secundum comparationis, as exemplified by, say, Pale su jače kiše 'stronger rains have fallen', which is freely used in Serbian; it is called, according to the grammatical tradition, absolute comparative. Attention has been drawn, while attempts were made at revealing the crucial features of the absolute comparative, {{to the fact that it}} is marked for its "amplified extension" on the scale of gradation; this shows that the comparative in the kind of use now under consideration has not lost its nature of an instrument of comparison. The grammatical structure in question has also been characterized as displaying sui generis semantic indefiniteness: the point is that the lack of the second object of comparison makes the scope of application of a given feature on the <b>gradation</b> <b>scale</b> rather fuzzy. The first part of the paper presents the distribution of the absolute comparative within the Slavonic linguistic area; the presentation is based on the existing grammars of particular Slavonic languages (however, Bulgarian and Macedonian have not been accounted for; the reason was that these languages have been "balcanized"). The evidence supplied by grammars allows us to distinguish, within the Slavonic area, two zones: the zone of marginal use of the form in question (Russian) or its limited use (Polish), and the zone of its active use, including Slovak, Czech, Sorbian, Slovenian and Serbian. The second part of the work describes the contrast between the situation in Serbian, on the one hand, and the situation in Polish, on the other: the focus is on the distinct divergence of the two languages in terms of textual distribution, frequency of occurrence and stylistic characteristics of the investigated structure. On the basis of the materials of bilateral translations of belletristic works, as well as those of the Serbian journalistic texts (as appearing in Internet), selected types of translational equivalences of the Serbian absolute comparative in Polish texts have been discussed; these are: the basic adjective in the positive, the negated antonym of the source adjective, and the construction "co + adjective in the comparative degree". In the last part of the article some selected differences concerning the use of the absolute comparative in Serbian and Polish journalistic texts have been pointed out. As shown in the course of the analysis, the Polish journalistic style tends to express sharp appraisals and distinct evaluations. This is particularly evident in isolated elements of press, such as titles, notices, advertising slogans. As a result, the absolute comparative, with its considerable degree of indefiniteness, appears to be less appropriate here. In contrary to this, the Serbian linguistic norm admits of a milder form of utterance, it admits of formulating less categorical judgments, even in journalistic style; this enhances the use of the absolute comparative which is well anchored both in the grammatical system and in linguistic awareness of the users of Serbian...|$|R
