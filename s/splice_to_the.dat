The flanking DNA of TRP- 1, unlike tyrosinase, does not contain a TATA box or a CCAAT box.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{studies have}} shown that {{transcription}} and alternative splicing can be mechanistically coupled. In the EPB 41 (protein 4. 1 R) and EPB 41 L 3 (protein 4. 1 B) genes, we showed previously that promoter/alternative first exon choice is coupled to downstream splicing events in exon 2. Here we demonstrate that this coupling is conserved among several vertebrate classes from fish to mammals. The EPB 41 and EPB 41 L 3 genes from fish, bird, amphibian, and mammal genomes exhibit shared features including alternative first exons and differential splice acceptors in exon 2. In all cases, the 5 ′-most exon (exon 1 A) splices exclusively to a weaker internal acceptor site in exon 2, skipping a fragment designated as exon 2 ′. Conversely, alternative first exons 1 B and 1 C always <b>splice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stronger first acceptor site, retaining exon 2 ′. These correlations are independent of cell type or species of origin. Since exon 2 ′ contains a translation initiation site, splice variants generate protein isoforms with distinct N-termini. We propose that these genes represent a physiologically relevant model system for mechanistic analysis of transcription-coupled alternative splicing...|$|E

We describe a novel intrasplicing {{mechanism by which}} exon 1 A (E 1 A) splices exclusively to the distal E 2 '/ 2 acceptor via two nested splicing reactions regulated by novel properties of exon 1 B (E 1 B). E 1 B behaves as an exon in the first step, using its consensus 5 ' donor to <b>splice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proximal E 2 '/ 2 acceptor. A long region of downstream intron is excised, juxtaposing E 1 B with E 2 '/ 2 to generate a new composite acceptor containing the E 1 B branchpoint/pyrimidine tract and E 2 distal 3 ' AG-dinucleotide. Next, the upstream E 1 A splices over E 1 B to this distal acceptor, excising the remaining intron plus E 1 B and E 2 ' to form mature E 1 A/E 2 product. We mapped branch points for both intrasplicing reactions and demonstrated that mutation of the E 1 B 5 ' splice site or branchpoint abrogates intrasplicing. In the 4. 1 R gene, intrasplicing ultimately determines N-terminal protein structure and function. More generally, intrasplicing represents a new mechanism whereby alternative promoters can be coordinated with downstream alternative splicing...|$|E

We show that {{the most frequently used}} 3 ′-splice site on the HPV- 16 genome, site SA 3358, which is used to produce primarily E 4, E 6, and E 7 mRNAs, is regulated by ASF/SF 2. Splice site SA 3358 is immediately followed by 15 potential binding sites for the splicing factor ASF/SF 2. Recombinant ASF/SF 2 binds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cluster of ASF/SF 2 sites. Mutational inactivation of all 15 sites abolished <b>splicing</b> <b>to</b> SA 3358 and redirected <b>splicing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> downstream-located, late 3 ′-splice site SA 5639. Overexpression of a mutant ASF/SF 2 protein that lacks the RS domain, also totally inhibited the usage of SA 3358 and redirected <b>splicing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> late 3 ′-splice site SA 5639. The 15 ASF/SF 2 binding sites could be replaced by an ASF/SF 2 -dependent, HIV- 1 -derived splicing enhancer named GAR. This enhancer was also inhibited by the mutant ASF/SF 2 protein that lacks the RS domain. Finally, silencer RNA (siRNA) -mediated knockdown of ASF/SF 2 caused a reduction in spliced HPV- 16 mRNA levels. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the major HPV- 16 3 ′-splice site SA 3358 is dependent on ASF/SF 2. SA 3358 is used by the most abundantly expressed HPV- 16 mRNAs, including those encoding E 6 and E 7. High levels of ASF/SF 2 may therefore be a requirement for progression to cervical cancer.

Here, we demonstrate that exon 1 and 2 ′/ 2 splicing diversity is regulated by a transcription-coupled splicing mechanism. We also implicate distinctive regulatory elements that promote the splicing of exon 1 A to the distal 3 ′ ss and exon 1 B to the proximal 3 ′ ss in murine erythroleukemia cells. A hybrid minigene driven by cytomegalovirus promoter mimicked 1 B-promoter–driven splicing patterns but differed from 1 A-promoter–driven splicing patterns, suggesting that promoter identity affects exon 2 ′/ 2 splicing. Furthermore, splicing factor SF 2 /ASF ultraviolet (UV) cross-linked to the exon 2 ′/ 2 junction CAGAGAA, a sequence that overlaps the distal U 2 AF 35 -binding 3 ′ ss.

The transcription initiation {{site of the}} murine gammaherpesvirus 68 episome maintenance protein, ORF 73, was mapped to the viral terminal repeats, more than 10 kb distant from the open reading frame (ORF) itself. A 5 ′ non-coding exon in the terminal repeats was spliced to the right end of the viral unique sequence, and then across ORFs 75 a, 75 b, 75 c and 74 to ORF 73. The right-hand portion of a single repeat unit was sufficient for constitutive promoter activity. The unique left end of the viral genome further enhanced ORF 73 transcription. This, together with the large size of the predominant ORF 73 mRNA, suggested that transcription initiates in distal repeat units and then splices between repeats to generate an extensive 5 ′ untranslated region. A second promoter in the left-hand portion of the proximal terminal repeat unit generated a transcript which overlapped that of ORF 73, but failed to <b>splice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ORF 73 coding exon and so transcribed ORF 75 a. In distal repeat copies however, transcription from this promoter would enter the next repeat unit to become an ORF 73 mRNA. There was a third promoter just upstream of ORF 73 itself.

Overall, six different promoters were found to drive STS expression, giving rise to transcripts with unique first exons that were labeled 0 a, 0 b, 0 c, 1 a, 1 c, and 1 d, of which the last two and 0 c are newly reported. All of them, except exon 1 d, vary in length owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> occurrence of multiple transcriptional start sites. While placental exon 1 a is partially coding, the other five first exons are all untranslated.
