By day, too--in the hazy heat when the clouds merged, scarce drifting, into the blue, and the coarse sea-grass tufts hardly quivered, and sea-birds passed close above the water with chuckle and cry--it all often seemed part of a dream. She bathed, and grew as tanned as her little daughter, a regular Gypsy, in her broad hat and linen frocks; and yet she hardly seemed to be living down here at all, for she was never free of the memory of that last meeting with Summerhay. Why had he spoken {{and put an end to}} their quiet friendship, and left her to such heart-searchings all by herself? But she did not want his words unsaid. Only, how to know whether to recoil and fly, or to pass beyond the dread of letting herself go, of plunging deep into the unknown depths of love--of that passion, whose nature for the first time she had tremulously felt, watching [...] "Pagliacci"--and had ever since been feeling and trembling at! Must it really be neck or nothing? Did she care enough to break through all barriers, fling herself into midstream? When they could see each other every day, it was so easy to live for the next meeting--not think of what was coming after. But now, with all else cut away, there was only the future to think about--hers and his. But need she trouble about his? Would he not just love her as long as he liked? ...|$|E

Boi-1da and T-Minus, A-list producers renowned for their work with Drake and other rap artists, have laced Lana with a heat-dazed, shade-cooled beat, a banger situated halfway between beach and trap. It's a track that any rapper would be proud to <b>surf</b> <b>over,</b> and Rocky knows it, delivering a calmly boastful, well-tailored verse punctuated by a choice, subdued set of A$AP affiliate Playboy Carti's ad-libs. Meanwhile Lana's voice, passionate and aching yet effortless and chill, sings to a lover free to change yet fated to accept her love. Racial subtext slips in through lines about 'white lines and black beaches', though the real poetic highlight is the 'blood-red sangrias'.

5000|$|Rodgers’s flight {{proceeded}} with few difficulties {{for more than}} 1200 miles. However, higher than expected fuel consumption and a weaker than predicted tailwind made it necessary for the plane to land in the ocean and refuel. The plane headed for a refueling ship, but limitations of the navigation technology and erroneous navigation {{information provided by the}} ship’s crew caused Rodgers and his crew to miss the ship. The flying boat was forced to land in the ocean when it ran out of fuel on September 1. Since the position of the plane was not known while it was in the air and the plane’s radio could not transmit when the plane was floating on the water, Rodgers and his crew were not found by an extensive, multi-day search by planes and a large number of ships. After passing a night without rescue, Rodgers and his crew used fabric from a wing to make a sail and sailed towards Hawaii, several hundred miles away. Later the plane’s crew used metal flooring to fashion leeboards to improve their ability to steer the flying boat while it was sailing. Finally, nine days later, after sailing the plane 450 miles to within 15 miles of Nawiliwili Bay, Kauai, the plane and its crew were found by submarine [...] under the command of Lt. Donald R. Osborn, Jr, (USNA class of 1920), after a search by the US Navy. They were towed near the reef outside of the port. The harbor master and his daughter rowed out to the plane and helped Rodgers and his crew <b>surf</b> <b>over</b> the reef and into the safety of the harbor. By the time they were found by the submarine, Rodgers and his crew had subsisted a week without food and with limited water. He later shared with a newspaper, [...] "We were taken care of by the good people of the island, who insisted on treating us as invalids, whereas {{as a matter of fact}} we were in very good shape and perfectly capable of taking care of ourselves." [...] After their return, Rodgers and his crew were treated as heroes. Also, despite not reaching Hawaii by air, their flight established a new non-stop air distance record for seaplanes of 1992 miles (3206 km).|$|E
40|$|An annual-mean surface-forced {{component}} of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC) in density space, surf(,?), is diagnosed from observed surface heat and freshwater fluxes. The climatological mean of <b>surf</b> <b>over</b> 1980 – 97 indicates steady overturning rates for those water masses that are principally formed through surface buoyancy forcing: 8 Sv of Greenland Sea Deep Water (GSDW), 4 Sv of Labrador Sea Water (LSW), and 4 Sv of 18 ° Water (STMW). Obtained for each year over 1980 – 97, surf reveals interannual-to-decadal variability in the renewal and overturning of these water masses. The total surface-forced overturning rate varies in the range 10 – 20 Sv, reaching peak values in 1989 – 90 and generally decreasing over the period 1990 – 97. More dramatic changes are apparent in the overturning of different water masses. The overturning of STMW exhibits large-amplitude interannual variability. A background positive trend over 1980 – 97 is dominated by variance of 13. 4 Sv. By contrast, the overturning rates of LSW and GSDW vary more slowly, on decadal timescales. LSW overturning rates increase from near zero in the early 1980 s {{to a maximum of}} 10 Sv in 1990 and return to near zero by 1997. Seemingly in antiphase, GSDW overturning rates decline from a peak rate of 11 Sv in 1981 to a minimum of 3. 5 Sv in 1991, and then increase somewhat up to 1997. The variability in these overturning rates is related to changes in the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) and the Arctic oscillation (AO) over 1980 – 97. Correlation coefficients between total overturning rate and three versions of the NAO index are significantly positive at a 99 % confidence level. Also highly significant is a correlation of LSW overturning and the AO index, and an anticorrelation between overturning of LSW and GSDW. The overturning of STMW is more weakly (and not significantly) anticorrelated with NAO indices, although there is highly significant anticorrelation between interannual changes in STMW overturning and one version of the NAO index. Stronger LSW (GSDW) overturning in years when NAO indices are relatively high (low) is consistent with recent hydrographic evidence. The extent to which these relationships support a hypothesis that the NAO drives interannual-to-decadal variability in the THC, through wintertime atmospheric buoyancy forcing of the ocean, is discussed. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Cross-shore {{exchange}} between the surf zone {{and the inner}} shelf is investigated using Lagrangian and Eulerian field measurements of rip current flows on a rip-channeled beach in Sand City, California. Surface drifters released on the inner shelf during weak wind conditions moved seaward due to rip current pulses and then returned shoreward in an arcing pattern, reentering the <b>surf</b> zone <b>over</b> shoals. The cross-shore velocities of the seaward- and shoreward-moving drifters were approximately equal in magnitude and decreased {{as a function of}} distance offshore. The drifters carried seaward by the rip current had maximum cross-shore velocities as they exited the surf zone and then decelerated as they moved offshore. The drifters moving shoreward accelerated as they approached the surfzone boundary with maximum cross-shore velocities as they reentered the <b>surf</b> zone <b>over</b> shoals. It was found that Stokes drift was not solely responsible for the onshore transport across the surfzone boundary. The cross-shore diffusivity on the inner shelf was greatest during observations of locally contained cross-shore exchange. These field observations provide evidence that the cross-shore {{exchange between}} the surf zone and inner shelf on a rip-channeled beach is due to wave-driven rip current circulations and results in surface material being contained within the nearshore region.
