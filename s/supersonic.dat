5|$|On 2 June 1972, a Phantom {{flying at}} <b>supersonic</b> speed shot down a MiG-19 over Thud Ridge in Vietnam {{for the first}} <b>supersonic</b> gun kill. At a {{recorded}} speed of Mach 1.2, Major Phil Handley's shoot down {{was the first and}} only recorded gun kill while flying at <b>supersonic</b> speeds.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} that the {{original}} proposals were being studied, advances in <b>supersonic</b> flight were proceeding rapidly. The narrow delta was establishing itself as a preferred planform for <b>supersonic</b> flight, replacing earlier designs like the swept-wing and trapezoidal layouts seen on designs like the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and the earlier WS-110 concepts. Engines {{able to cope with}} higher temperatures and widely varying intake ramp air speeds were also under design, allowing for sustained <b>supersonic</b> speeds.|$|E
5|$|The Avro 732 was a 1956 {{proposal}} for a <b>supersonic</b> development of the Vulcan {{and would have been}} powered by 8 de Havilland Gyron Junior engines. Unlike the proposed Avro 721 low-level bomber of 1952 or the Avro 730 <b>supersonic</b> stainless steel canard bomber dating from 1954 (cancelled in 1957 before completion of the prototype), the Type 732 showed its Vulcan heritage.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy {{planned to}} develop and {{introduce}} the <b>supersonic</b> P.1154 independently of the cancelled NATO requirement. This ambition was complicated by the conflicting requirements between the two services—while the RAF wanted a low-level <b>supersonic</b> strike aircraft, the Navy sought a twin-engine air defence fighter. Following {{the election of the}} Labour Government of 1964 the P.1154 was cancelled, as the Royal Navy had already begun procurement of the McDonnell Douglas Phantom II and the RAF placed a greater importance on the BAC TSR-2's ongoing development. Work continued on elements of the project, such as a <b>supersonic</b> PCB-equipped Pegasus engine, with the intention of developing a future Harrier variant for the decades following cancellation.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Dart {{began as}} Convair's entry in a 1948 U.S. Navy contest for a <b>supersonic</b> {{interceptor}} aircraft. During the time, {{there was much}} skepticism about operating <b>supersonic</b> aircraft from carrier decks. So {{in order to address}} this issue, U.S. Navy ordered many subsonic fighters. The worry had some foundation, since many <b>supersonic</b> designs of the time required long takeoff rolls, had high approach speeds, and were not very stable or easy to control—all factors that were troublesome on a carrier.|$|E
5|$|This {{appeared}} {{to offer a}} solution {{to one of the}} most vexing problems of the era, designing an aircraft that was effective at subsonic and <b>supersonic</b> speeds. Subsonic lift is created by the airflow around the wing following streamlines, but <b>supersonic</b> lift is generated by shock waves at points of critical curvature. No single design could offer high performance for both regimes. The blown disk could attack this problem by being laid out for <b>supersonic</b> performance only, and then using jet thrust to modify subsonic airflow into a semblance of a normal wing. The resulting design would be tuned for high <b>supersonic</b> performance, have reasonable subsonic performance, and would also offer VTOL, all in a single design.|$|E

5|$|AFVG (standing for Anglo-French Variable Geometry) was a 1960s {{project for}} <b>supersonic</b> {{multi-role}} combat aircraft with a variable-geometry wing, jointly developed by British Aircraft Corporation in the United Kingdom and Dassault Aviation of France.|$|E
5|$|BCal {{entered into}} a bid to acquire at least one Concorde. However, BCal {{eventually}} arranged for two aircraft to be leased from BA and Aérospatiale respectively, to be maintained by either BA or Air France. BCal's envisaged two-Concorde fleet would have required {{a high level of}} aircraft usage to be cost-effective; therefore, BCal had decided to operate the second aircraft on a <b>supersonic</b> service between Gatwick and Atlanta, with a stopover at either Gander or Halifax. Consideration was given to services to Houston and various points on its South American network at a later stage. Both <b>supersonic</b> services were to be launched at some point during 1980; however, steeply rising oil prices caused by the 1979 energy crisis led to BCal shelving their <b>supersonic</b> ambitions.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} speeds, large forces {{were applied to}} the {{aircraft}} during banks and turns, and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at <b>supersonic</b> speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard elevons, varying at differing speeds including <b>supersonic.</b> Only the innermost elevons, which {{are attached to the}} stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed. Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed. This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.|$|E

This also includes banners and trophies, which would be displayed in a museum until a new franchise is brought to Seattle to be hung from the rafters of its arena. The original franchise, now the Oklahoma City Thunder, continue to keep the <b>SuperSonics</b> tie-ins, including records, championships, and retired numbers, until a new <b>SuperSonics</b> franchise is brought to Seattle. Both the Thunder and a potential new <b>SuperSonics</b> franchise would [...] "share" [...] the original <b>SuperSonics</b> history.|$|R
5|$|In mid-1956, initial {{designs were}} {{presented}} by the two companies. Zip fuel was {{to be used in}} the afterburners to improve range by 10 to 15 percent over conventional fuel. Both designs featured huge wing tip fuel tanks that could be jettisoned when their fuel was depleted before a <b>supersonic</b> dash to the target. The tanks also included the outer portions of the wing, which would also be jettisoned to produce a smaller wing suitable for <b>supersonic</b> speeds. Both became trapezoidal wings after ejection, at that time the highest performance planform known. They also featured flush cockpits to maintain the highest fineness ratio possible in spite of its effects on visibility.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} reason for BCal's interest in Concorde was that the British Government's 1976 aviation policy review had opened the possibility of BA setting up <b>supersonic</b> services in competition with BCal's established sphere of influence. To counteract this potential threat, BCal considered their own independent Concorde plans, {{as well as a}} partnership with BA. BCal were considered most likely to have set up a Concorde service on the Gatwick–Lagos route, a major source of revenue and profits within BCal's scheduled route network; BCal's Concorde task force did assess the viability of a daily <b>supersonic</b> service complementing the existing subsonic widebody service on this route.|$|E
5|$|Owing to air {{compression}} {{in front of}} the plane as it travelled at <b>supersonic</b> speed, the fuselage heated up and expanded by as much as 300mm (almost 1ft). The most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the flight engineer's console and the bulkhead. On some aircraft that conducted a retiring <b>supersonic</b> flight, the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap, wedging the cap when it shrank again. To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a heat sink for the heat from the air conditioning. The same method also cooled the hydraulics. During <b>supersonic</b> flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became heated, and a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit.|$|E

5|$|The United States {{cancelled}} the Boeing 2707, its rival <b>supersonic</b> transport programme, in 1971. Observers {{have suggested}} that opposition to Concorde on grounds of noise pollution had been encouraged by the United States Government, as it lacked its own competitor. The US, India, and Malaysia all ruled out Concorde <b>supersonic</b> flights over the noise concern, although some of these restrictions were later relaxed. Professor Douglas Ross characterised restrictions placed upon Concorde operations by President Jimmy Carter's administration as having been an act of protectionism of American aircraft manufacturers. Concorde flew to an altitude of 68,000ft (20,700m) during a test flight in June 1973.|$|E

5|$|To fly {{non-stop}} {{across the}} Atlantic Ocean, Concorde required the greatest <b>supersonic</b> range of any aircraft. This {{was achieved by}} a combination of engines which were highly efficient at <b>supersonic</b> speeds, a slender fuselage with high fineness ratio, and a complex wing shape for a high lift-to-drag ratio. This also required carrying only a modest payload and a high fuel capacity, and the aircraft was trimmed with precision to avoid unnecessary drag.|$|E
5|$|As a diplodocid, it is {{probable}} that Dinheirosaurus possessed a whip-tail. If it did, it is likely that its tail could be used like a bullwhip, with <b>supersonic</b> speed. Being related to both Apatosaurus and Diplodocus, Dinheirosaurus probably possessed a squared snout. This means that it was probably a non-selective ground-feeding sauropod.|$|E
