Data regarding the interaction of losigamone with GABA receptors are inconsistent: it increases GABA-induced chloride influx in <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>neuron</b> cultures, but has no significant influence on GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in hippocampal slices.

Results from both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirm that the pharmacological activity profiles of the two losigamone enantiomers are not identical and suggest further that excitatory amino acid-mediated processes {{are involved in the}} mode of action of (+)-losigamone (the compound shown in the image) whereas ( [...] - [...] )-losigamone does not possess such properties.|$|E
40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is {{a progressive}} neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve {{cells in the}} brain and the spinal cord. Previous proteomic evidence revealed that the content of certain peptide fragments including Vgf-derived peptide aa 398 - 411 (Vgf 398 - 411) of the precursor Vgf protein in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) correctly identified patients with ALS from normal and disease controls. Using quantitative ELISA immunoassay we found that the CSF levels of Vgf decreases with muscle weakness in patients with ALS. In SOD 1 G 93 A transgenic mice, loss of full-length Vgf content in CSF, serum and in SMI- 32 immunopositive spinal cord motor neurons is noted in asymptomatic animals (approximately 75 days old) and continues to show a progressive decline as animals weaken. In vitro studies show that viral-mediated exogenous Vgf expression in primary mixed <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>neuron</b> cultures attenuates excitotoxic injury. Thus, while Vgf may be a reliable biomarker of progression of muscle weakness in patients with ALS, restoration of Vgf expression in spinal cord motor neurons may therapeutically rescue spinal cord motorneurons against excitotoxic injury. </p...|$|E
40|$|Notch receptors are key {{regulators}} {{of nervous}} system development and promoters of neural stem cells renewal and proliferation. Defects in {{the expression of}} Notch genes result in severe, often lethal developmental abnormalities. Notch 3 is generally thought to have a similar proliferative, anti-differentiation and gliogenic role to Notch 1. However, in some cases, Notch 3 has an opposite, pro-differentiation effect. Here, we show that Notch 3 segregates from Notch 1 and is transiently expressed in adult rat and mouse <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>neuron</b> precursors and immature neurons. This suggests that during the differentiation of adult neural progenitor cells, Notch signalling may follow {{a modified version of}} the classical lateral inhibition model, involving the segregation of individual Notch receptors. Notch 3 knockout mice, otherwise neurologically normal, are character-ized by a reduced number of mature inhibitory interneurons and an increased number of highly excitable immature neurons in spinal cord lami-nae I–II. As a result, these mice have permanently lower nociceptive thresholds, similar to chronic pain. These results suggest that defective neuronal differentiation, for example as a result of reduced Notch 3 expression or activation, may underlie human cases of intractable chronic pain, such as fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain...|$|E

Materials and Methods:The SCI model was established in rats in vivo and the primary <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>neurons</b> were subjected to mechanical injury (MI) in vitro. The apoptosis in <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> tissue and <b>neurons</b> was assessed by TUNEL staining and Hoechst 33342 staining, respectively. The autophagy-related proteins levels were detected by Western blot. The activation of AMPK/SIRT 1 pathway was determined by Western blot and immunohistochemical staining. Results: We found that the apoptosis of <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> tissue and cell damage of <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>neurons</b> was obvious after the trauma. The ratio of LC 3 II/LC 3 I and level of p 62 were first increased significantly and then decreased after the trauma in vivo and in vitro, indicating the defect in autophagy. The levels of p-AMPK and SIRT 1 were increased obviously after the trauma in vivo and in vitro.

Loss of the integrity and plasticity of neuronal morphology and connectivity comprises an early step in neuronal degeneration and ultimate decline of cognitive function. We examined in vitro whether TNFα or IL- 1 β impaired morphology and motility of growth cones in <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>neuron</b> cultures. TNFα and IL- 1 β paralyzed growth cone motility and induced growth cone collapse in a dose-dependent manner reflected by complete attenuation of neurite outgrowth. Scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) or inhibiting NADPH oxidase activity rescued loss of neuronal motility and morphology. TNFα and IL- 1 β provoked rapid, NOX-mediated generation of ROS in advancing growth cones, which preceded paralysis of motility and collapse of morphology. Increases in ROS intermediates were accompanied by an aberrant, nonproductive reorganization of actin filaments.

40|$|The {{survival}} promoting and neuroprotective {{actions of}} {{brain-derived neurotrophic factor}} (BDNF) are well known but under certain circumstances this growth factor can also exacerbate excitotoxic insults to neurons. Prior exploration of the receptor through which BDNF exerts this action on motor neurons deflects attention away from p 75. Here we investigated the possibility that BDNF acts through the receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkB, to confer on motor neurons sensitivity to excitotoxic challenge. We blocked BDNF activation of TrkB using a dominant negative TrkB mutant or a TrkB function blocking antibody, and found that this protected motor neurons against excitotoxic insult in cultures of mixed spinal cord neurons. Addition of a function blocking antibody to BDNF to mixed <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>neuron</b> cultures is also neuroprotective indicating that endogenously produced BDNF participates in vulnerability to excitotoxicity. We next examined the intracellular signaling cascades that are engaged upon TrkB activation. Previously we found that inhibition of the phosphatidylinositide- 3 '-kinase (PI 3 'K) pathway blocks BDNF-induced excitotoxic sensitivity. Here we show that expression of a constitutively active catalytic subunit of PI 3 'K, p 110, confers excitotoxic sensitivity (ES) upon motor neurons not incubated with BDNF.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} genetic and/or pharmacological ablation of the TRPV 1 +/peptidergic or the MrgprD+/non-peptidergic subset of nociceptors produced selective, modality-specific deficits in the behavioural responses to heat and mechanical stimuli, respectively. To assess whether this modality-specific contribution is also manifest {{at the level}} of <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>neuron</b> responsiveness, here we made extracellular recordings from lumbar dorsal horn neurons of the mouse in response to graded thermal and mechanical stimulation. We found that, following intrathecal injection of capsaicin to eliminate the central terminals of TRPV 1 + nociceptors, neurons in the region of laminae I and V of the spinal cord lost responsiveness to noxious heat (whether generated by a contact heat probe or diode laser), with no change in their response to noxious mechanical stimulation. In contrast, ablation of MrgprD+ afferents did not alter the response to noxious heat, but reduced the firing of superficial dorsal horn nociceptive-specific neurons in response to graded mechanical stimulation and decreased the relative number of wide dynamic range neurons that were exclusively mechanosensitive. Neither ablation procedure reduced the number of dorsal horn neurons that responded to noxious cold. These findings support the conclusion that TRPV 1 + nociceptors are necessary and probably sufficient for noxious heat activation of dorsal horn neurons and that, despite their polymodal properties, TRPV 1 + and MrgprD+ nociceptors provide modality-specific contributions to the response properties of spinal cord neurons. © 2013 The Physiological Society...|$|E

We investigated whether pegfilgrastim, GCSF with sustained action, is protective in a mouse model of {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS). ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with manifestations of upper and lower motoneuron death and muscle atrophy accompanied by inflammation in the CNS and periphery. Methods Human mutant G 93 A superoxide dismutase (SOD 1) ALS mice were treated with pegfilgrastim starting at the presymptomatic stage and continued until the end stage. After long-term pegfilgrastim treatment, the inflammation status was defined in the spinal cord and peripheral tissues including hematopoietic organs and muscle. The effect of GCSF on <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>neuron</b> survival and microglia, bone marrow and spleen monocyte activation was assessed in vitro. Results Long-term pegfilgrastim treatment prolonged mutant SOD 1 mice survival and attenuated both astro- and microgliosis in the spinal cord. Pegfilgrastim in SOD 1 mice modulated the inflammatory cell populations in the bone marrow and spleen and reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine in monocytes and microglia. The mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells into the circulation was restored back to basal level after long-term pegfilgrastim treatment in SOD 1 mice while the storage of Ly 6 C expressing monocytes in the bone marrow and spleen remained elevated. After pegfilgrastim treatment, an increased proportion of these cells in the degenerative muscle was detected at the end stage of ALS. Conclusions GCSF attenuated inflammation in the CNS and the periphery in a mouse model of ALS and thereby delayed the progression of the disease.

In this study, the effect of MK‑ 801 on the apoptosis of <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>neurons</b> in rats that have received a fetal <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> (FSC) transplant following spinal hemisection was investigated.

40|$|Tetanus neurotoxin {{causes the}} disease tetanus, which is {{characterized}} by rigid paralysis. The toxin acts by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters from inhibitory <b>neurons</b> in the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> that innervate motor neurons and is unique among the clostridial neurotoxins due to its ability to shuttle from the periphery to the central nervous system. Tetanus neurotoxin is thought to interact with a high affinity receptor complex that is composed of lipid and protein components; however, {{the identity of the}} protein receptor remains elusive. In the current study, we demonstrate that toxin binding, to dissociated hippocampal and <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>neurons,</b> is greatly enhanced by driving synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Moreover, tetanus neurotoxin entry and subsequent cleavage of synaptobrevin II, the substrate for this toxin, was also dependent on synaptic vesicle recycling. Next, we identified the potential synaptic vesicle binding protein for the toxin and found that it corresponded to SV 2; tetanus neurotoxin was unable to cleave synaptobrevin II in SV 2 knockout neurons. Toxin entry into knockout neurons was rescued by infecting with viruses that express SV 2 A or SV 2 B. Tetanus toxin elicited the hyper excitability in dissociated <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>neurons</b> - due to preferential loss of inhibitory transmission - that is characteristic of the disease.

40|$|Abstract Background Genetically {{modified}} pseudorabies virus (Prv) proved {{suitable for}} the delivery of foreign genes to rodent embryonic neurons ex vivo and maintaining foreign gene expression after transplantation into <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> in our earlier study. The question arose of whether human embryonic neurons, which {{are known to be}} more resistant to Prv, could also be infected with a mutant Prv. Specifically, we investigated whether a mutant Prv with deleted ribonucleotide reductase and early protein 0 genes has the potential to deliver marker genes (gfp and β-gal) into human embryonic <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>neurons</b> and whether the infected neurons maintain expression after transplantation into adult mouse cord. Results The results revealed that the mutant Prv effectively infected human embryonic <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>neurons</b> ex vivo and the grafted cells exhibited reporter gene expression for several weeks. Grafting of infected human embryonic cells into the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> of immunodeficient (rnu-/rnu-) mice resulted in the infection of some of the host neurons. Discussion These results suggest that Prv is {{suitable for the}} delivery of foreign genes into transplantable human cells. This delivery method may offer a new approach to use genetically modified cells for grafting in animal models where <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> neuronal loss or axon degeneration occurs. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBrn- 3. 0, a POU-domain {{transcription}} factor, {{is expressed}} in specific postmitotic neurons in the dorsal part of the neural tube which are among the first <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>neurons</b> to appear in development. In the mature <b>spinal</b> <b>cord,</b> the Brn- 3. 0 cells form a numerous population of scattered neurons in the intermediate spinal gray. Ablation of the notochord in chick embryos extends the domain of Brn- 3. 0 expression into the ventral neural tube, while ectopic grafts of notochord tissue suppress Brn- 3. 0 expression. The notochord effects on Brn- 3. 0 expression are reproducedin vivoby the implantation of a local source of recombinant Shh protein. The down-regulation of Brn- 3. 0 expression in the dorsal <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> by the notochord and Shh contrasts with the known inductive effects of these ventral signals on the approximately simultaneous development of the spinal motor neurons. In cultured explants of neural plate from {{the region of the}} presumptive <b>spinal</b> <b>cord,</b> Brn- 3. 0 neurons develop in the absence of surface ectoderm and ventral midline tissue, suggesting that the Brn- 3. 0 phenotype may represent a “default” developmental pathway for early <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>neurons.</b> Together these results advance the understanding of the mechanism of the generation of neuronal diversity in the developing vertebrate CNS...|$|R
40|$|The Eph family {{tyrosine}} kinase receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, {{have been shown}} to play critical roles in cell migration, tissue morphogenesis, and axonal guidance in many different systems. However, their function in the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> has not been examined carefully. We showed in this study that several Eph receptors, including EphA 3, Eph A 4, and Eph A 5, are expressed in the ventral <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> in partially overlapping patterns, with EphA 5 exhibiting the most widespread transcription in the entire ventral <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> during early development. Complementary to the receptor expression, a ligand of these receptors, ephrin-A 5, is transcribed in the dorsal half of the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord.</b> Consistent with the spatial location of receptor expression, the ligand selectively inhibits neurite outgrowth and induces cell death of the ventral, but not the dorsal, <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>neurons.</b> These observations suggest that interactions between the Eph family receptors and ligands exerts negative influences on ventral <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>neurons</b> and thus may play important roles in regulating morphogenesis and axon guidance in the <b>spinal</b> <b>cord.</b> Key words: Eph family receptors; ephrins; neurite outgrowth; spinal cord; apoptosis; in situ hybridization The Eph family receptor {{tyrosine kinase}}s and their ligands, the ephrins, have been shown recently to play critical roles in the development of axonal connections (for review, see Harris an...|$|R
