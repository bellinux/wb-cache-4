5|$|Early in its existence, {{the league}} hoped to quickly expand to 12 teams, {{but due to}} <b>some</b> <b>teams</b> having {{financial}} difficulties they didn't attain it. In the 2017–18 season, the Asia League Ice Hockey has eight teams; four teams from Japan, three teams from South Korea, and one from Russia.|$|E
5|$|Collegiate teams {{participating}} in the IARC have come primarily from the United States and the Peoples Republic of China, but also from Germany, England, Switzerland, Spain, Canada, Chile, Qatar, Iran, and India. Teams {{range in size from}} several students, up to twenty or more. Both undergraduate and graduate students populate the teams, but <b>some</b> <b>teams</b> have been composed entirely of undergraduates or postgraduates. Industry is not permitted to enter, but it may assist the student teams with funding and equipment.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} new season, <b>some</b> <b>teams</b> opted to keep the same line-up as {{they had in the}} {{previous}} season; however, <b>some</b> <b>teams</b> changed drivers. One of the main changes involved the début appearance of Jaguar in the sport with the 2008–09 A1 Grand Prix champion Adam Carroll and the 2012 GP3 Series title winner Mitch Evans competing for the team. Team Aguri was purchased by Chinese sports development and management firm SECA during the previous season and was renamed Techeetah with Jean-Éric Vergne and Ma Qinghua announced as the team's drivers. Defending FIA GT World Cup champion Maro Engel was hired by Venturi to replace World Endurance Championship driver Mike Conway, while Virgin employed three-time consecutive World Touring Car champion José María López to partner Formula E race winner Sam Bird. The final change involved two-time Macau Grand Prix winner and reigning European Formula Three champion Felix Rosenqvist entering the series with Mahindra and partnering Nick Heidfeld. Defending drivers' champion Sébastien Buemi stayed at e.Dams-Renault after his title-winning campaign, with the Swiss driver again being joined by Nico Prost.|$|E

5|$|Several of {{the teams}} voiced {{concerns}} of various matters involving the stadia and practicing facilities: many of the stadiums were considered incomplete, whilst <b>some</b> <b>teams</b> claimed that the pitches were uneven, resulting in an unsafe experience to be batting in. Ultimately none of the stadia used in the warm-up games were used in {{any other part of}} the tournament except for the Greenfield Stadium in Trelawny, Jamaica, which hosted the opening ceremony but no matches.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>teams</b> {{had made}} {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Honda introduced a more powerful version of its V10 engine for Saturday's qualifying session and the race. Sauber brought lighter components to reduce the weight of their cars and the Williams team arrived with a revised rear wing. Williams engine suppliers BMW confirmed that they would be running the same specification of engine introduced in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotters}} {{were initially}} equipped with Teleradio 3A sets and amateur equipment; however, many outstations later had these replaced by improved 3B and 3BZ sets to provide higher power communications. This occurred following {{a decision to}} standardise on the 3B following {{the formation of the}} NGAWW. In addition, <b>some</b> <b>teams</b> operating in more difficult jungle and mountain terrain, such as that closer to Port Moresby, were equipped with RAAF supplied ATR-2 radios which were lighter than the Teleradio 3A sets provided to the more distant outstations.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} war league after the {{outbreak}} of World War II (1940–41) Stockport finished in 35th place overall in the Northern Regional League after playing 29 games. League standings were calculated by goal average {{over the course of}} games played, with <b>some</b> <b>teams</b> playing more than others. In 1945–46, English football still did not have a football season; however, The FA Cup competition was resumed. Stockport was eliminated from the 1945–46 FA Cup in the first round after a 3–2 aggregate loss to Rochdale. The first post-war league season 1946–47 saw Stockport finish fourth in Division 3 (North) with 24 wins and 50 points.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>teams</b> made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the Grand Prix. Williams, Jaguar, Ferrari, Sauber and Prost all brought updated front wings. Ferrari also introduced a new underfloor and brought more powerful versions of their V10 engines for qualifying and the race. Williams installed extra cooling on their cars to combat high temperatures in qualifying. Minardi planned to introduce a new revision to their cars aerodynamic package which included a new engine cover, a titanium gearbox and rear suspension geometry. The team decided to only test the gearbox during the first free practice session.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>teams</b> made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Audi installed low-downforce setups on its No. 7 and 8 cars while their third entry used a version observed at the Silverstone race. The design was optimised to omit downforce, thereby reducing drag, for better preparation for competing on high-speed tracks. This was done by modifying the car's side pods and openings on the inside surface of its fenders. New cooling techniques were achieved by creating new suspension solutions to restrict spring displacement which also reduced underside turbulent airflow. Porsche chose to use high downforce configurations on all three of their 919 Hybrid cars as they did previously at Silverstone. The ByKolles CLM P1/01 was further developed and had a new front nose equipped after it completed a shakedown test on 24 April.|$|E

5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>teams</b> made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Minardi débuted a new gearbox which was constructed out of titanium, the first for a Formula One team. Prost made {{modifications to}} their cars oil system to improve the reliability of their engines and made minor aerodynamic changes to the front wing and the floor. The team also used an updated version of their engine the Peugeot A20 EV2 during the Friday practice sessions and reverted to the EV3 {{for the remainder of the}} weekend. BAR fitted their cars with a revised aerodynamic package which included new bargeboards and rear wings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>teams</b> made {{technical}} {{changes to}} their cars for the Grand Prix. McLaren introduced a revised aerodynamic for their MP4/15 chassis, aimed at {{increasing the amount}} of downforce, and therefore grip, produced by the bodywork. They also brought revised nose wings. BAR fitted their cars with one-off components that were produced to help optimise the performance of the monocoque's cooling systems. Ferrari introduced an aerodynamic set-up similar to that used at the Monaco Grand Prix, and the team debuted {{a modified version of the}} F1-2000's chimneys. Minardi arrived with new radiator intakes and exits to rectify temperature issues with their Fondmetal V10 engines.|$|E
5|$|There are, however, {{historical}} inaccuracies in the film's {{depiction of}} the Normandy campaign. At {{the time of the}} mission, American forces from the two American beach areas, Utah and Omaha, had not yet linked up. In reality, a Ranger team operating out of the Omaha beach area would have had to move through the heavily enemy-occupied city of Carentan, or swim or boat across the estuary linking Carentan to the channel, or transfer by boat to the Utah landing area. On the other hand, US forces moving out of Utah would have had direct and much shorter routes, relatively unencumbered by enemy positions, and were already in contact with <b>some</b> <b>teams</b> from both US airborne divisions landed in the area.|$|E

5|$|Each Asia League Ice Hockey {{regulation}} game is an {{ice hockey}} game played between two teams and is 60 minutes long. The game comprises three 20-minute periods separated by two 15 minute intermissions. While <b>some</b> <b>teams</b> have television broadcast contracts, {{they do not}} take television time-outs like the NHL. At {{the end of the}} 60 minute game, the team with the most goals wins. If the game is tied at the end of 60 minutes, the teams play an overtime period. Overtime is five minutes, with four skaters on each team. If the game remains tied after five minutes, then the teams partake in a three player shoot-out, until one team comes out ahead. Prior to the 2008–09 season these games ended in a tie with no shoot-out. In a playoff game the league doesn't use the shoot-out and instead the teams play continual overtime periods of 20 minutes until one team scores.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>teams</b> made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault introduced diffuser designs similar to the Red Bull RB6. Ferrari's design largely changed the shape of their exhaust system, and introduced a new gearbox case for Massa's car to raise the pick-up points of its rear suspension to help him adjust to the changes. They constructed a larger radiator to deal with the additional heat. Mercedes elected not to bring a new gearbox casing, but introduced a new rear diffuser to fully utilise the air blowing from the car's exhaust. Renault's design had the exit of their car's exhaust which had thermal protection against high temperatures and the team introduced a new design of their gearbox casing to allow for the pick-up points for its rear suspension to be accommodated. After running the F-duct device (which increases a car's top speed) in Friday practice, Red Bull decided to use it {{for the remainder of the}} weekend.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>teams</b> {{modified}} {{their cars}} {{in preparation for}} the event. Red Bull and Williams revised their brake ducts. Williams team changed their brake ducts at the front to improve airflow inside the tyres and direct the duct towards their car's central section more efficiently. Red Bull's brake ducts, which had been changed for the third consecutive Grand Prix, reintroduced a small fin seen at the Singapore Grand Prix; for Korea two aerodynamic fins were fitted and a larger duct was introduced. McLaren modified a version of their front wings first introduced in Singapore. The team added a vertical gurney flap and an additional vertical slot at the front wing endplate to improve airflow outside the front tyres and increase the amount of downforce and therefore grip produced by the bodywork. The team also brought a new rear wing and tested a new revision of their F-duct system that débuted at the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka. Ferrari revised their diffuser with curved profiles and one large middle plate designed to improve the extraction of air {{from the bottom of the}} F10. As in Suzuka, Toro Rosso ran an F-duct system in the Friday practice sessions.|$|E

5|$|The NHL Entry Draft {{eligibility}} requires {{players to}} have turned 18 years old by September 15 in the year the draft is held, excluding players older than 20 years old before December 31 of that same year, the latter not applying to non-North American players. The draft order {{is determined by the}} previous season's order of finish: non-playoff teams draft first in order of placement in the standings, followed by teams that competed in the post-season whose order is determined by the Stanley Cup playoffs results. Once the regular season is over, a weighted lottery is held for the 14 teams who miss the playoffs, giving teams the opportunity to move up to a higher pick including the first overall selection. From 1995 to 2012, a team that won the lottery could only move up a maximum of four picks, preventing <b>some</b> <b>teams</b> from winning the top selection regardless of winning the lottery. During that time, the Islanders won the lottery twice, receiving the top selection both times (2000 and 2009). The team finished last in the league standings in the 2000–01 season, but picked second in the draft after the Atlanta Thrashers won the lottery.|$|E
5|$|The race, {{the sixth}} of the season, began at 3:30p.m. EST, and was {{televised}} {{live in the}} United States on ABC. Scott Dixon held his lead from pole position, with Will Power behind him. Justin Wilson made light contact with a wall during the first lap of the race, and pitted shortly after due to a flat right-rear tire. The team discovered additional damage to the suspension that required lengthy repairs, but {{he was able to}} return to the race. During the fifth lap, <b>some</b> <b>teams</b> reported that parts of the track were deteriorating, but it was not felt that any action needed to be taken. Three laps later, Rubens Barrichello, who had gained four places started suffering mechanical problems, which forced him to retire from the race after eleven laps. Wilson set the fastest lap of the race during the ninth lap, completing a circuit in 1 minute 12.0651 seconds. On lap 10, Ryan Hunter-Reay blocked Ryan Briscoe from passing him, drawing a warning from race director Beaux Barfield. Sébastien Bourdais, who, along with Alex Tagliani and Oriol Servia, was running his first street race of the season without a Lotus engine, had made it to seventh before suffering mechanical problems which curtailed his race after 24 laps. James Jakes, who was suffering from problems with his brakes throughout {{the early part of the}} race eventually retired on lap 36, having spent ten laps in the pits earlier trying to resolve the issue.|$|E
5|$|The 2005–06 season saw {{a number}} of changes to the make-up of Asia League. In the off-season, the Golden Amur withdrew from the league due to {{financial}} trouble. At {{the same time it}} was announced that Kangwon Land was showing interest in entering a team in the league. However, only a few weeks later, they withdrew their application because it was felt their team wasn't strong enough to enter the league. The league also revised the limits on the number of imports <b>some</b> <b>teams</b> were allowed to have. Halla and the Ice Bucks were both allowed to carry an additional import player while the two Chinese teams were permitted two more import players. It was announced in July 2005 that Anyang Halla Winia would change their name to Anyang Halla. In late July, the league announced that Kangwon Land had acquired some imports and strengthened the team. They had applied again and were expected to enter the league that season. As well another new team, the Nordic Vikings, was expected to join the league. The Nordic Vikings were a Swedish-Chinese joint venture that saw the team based in Beijing. As part of the venture, Swedish players were also sent to the two existing Chinese teams. This brought the league to its high point of nine teams. Even though there were more teams than in the previous season the league reduced the number of games from 42 to 38, which resulted in an uneven schedule. For example, the Korean teams played nine games against each other, while playing four games against the teams from Japan and China except the Nordic Vikings, whom they played five times. At the end of the regular season, the Nippon Paper Cranes had captured first place for a {{second year in a row}} with 95 points. While the Cranes had a very strong showing in the point rankings, the top goal scorer was Song Dong-hwan from Anyang Halla with 31. Derek Plante led in assists with 47 and overall points with 75. The top six teams advanced to the playoffs with the top two teams, the Cranes and Halla, receiving a bye to the semi-finals. In the first round, Kokudo swept the Ice Bucks while Oji Paper defeated the Vikings three games to one. In the second round Kokudo faced Halla, who were making their playoff debut. Kokudo won that series three games to one. On the other side, the Cranes faced off against Oji Paper and swept them in three games. The final was again the Cranes vs Kokudo and once again Kokudo emerged victorious, claiming the title for the second year in a row. Kokudo had three players claiming the three top points spots for the playoffs. Joel Prpic was the top goal scorer with nine, Kiyoshi Fujita had the most assists with 12 and Takahito Suzuki had the most points with 18. Kikuchi Naoya won MVP of the year for the second time and Young Guy of the Year went to Masahito Nishiwaki of the Cranes.|$|E
