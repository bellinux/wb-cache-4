50|$|There are six {{groups of}} tool steels: water-hardening, cold-work, shock-resistant, high-speed, hot-work, and special purpose. The choice of group to select depends on cost, working temperature, {{required}} surface hardness, strength, shock resistance, and toughness requirements. The more severe the <b>service</b> <b>condition</b> (higher temperature, abrasiveness, corrosiveness, loading), {{the higher the}} alloy content and consequent amount of carbides required for the tool steel.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} an {{effort has been}} made to study the effect on the {{performance}} of the plasma nitrided AISI H 13 hot-forging dies and punches in two different forging <b>service</b> <b>conditions</b> –namely, fully-automatic and semi-automatic processes. The plasma nitriding is performed to increase the surface properties like –wear resistance and surface hardness of these components. After plasma nitriding the surface hardness of these materials has increased typically from ~ 500 HV 0. 01 to ~ 1200 HV 0. 01. In the plasma nitriding process high-voltage electrical energy is used to form plasma through which nitrogen ions are accelerated to impinge on the workpiece. The ion bombardment heats the workpiece, cleans the surface, and provides active nitrogen to make iron-nitride compounds. The iron-nitride compounds then diffuse to the workspace to harden the surface. In these two <b>service</b> <b>conditions</b> the plasma nitrided hot-forging dies and punches have shown typically 2. 5 to 4 times increment during the performance. It is observed that the increment in the performance of the dies and punches depends on the forging <b>service</b> <b>conditions,</b> i. e., temperature of the dies and punches, shot repetition time and effective cooling of dies and punches in <b>service</b> <b>conditions.</b> Four times increment in the performance of die...|$|R

50|$|Majority of {{the local}} {{teachers}} were the products of Davuilevu Teachers’ Training Institute but the opening of Natabua Teachers’ training Institute and the Cawaci Centre in 1929 produced more trained teachers for the schools.The administration of education {{in those days was}} done under the guidance and direction of the Director of Education but the status and <b>service</b> <b>condition</b> of the teachers were somewhat insecure and uncertain. Teachers were often victimised, over worked, underpaid and above all had to please many masters or bosses. The two newly formed teachers’ organizations were not strong enough to voice their opinions and protests to bring harmony in the profession. The solution as seen by the teachers at that time lay {{in the creation of a}} united body of teachers for all of Fiji.On 9 March 1930 the Lautoka Teachers’ Association decided to hold a conference for all the teachers of Fiji. A lot of teachers from Suva could not attend the Lautoka meeting because of the transport difficulty and the inclement weather. They held their own meeting in Suva. This date became historic for the Fiji Teachers’ Union because it was at these meetings that the decision to amalgamate the Suva and Lautoka Teachers’ Associations was made. Following Indian teachers from Lautoka were part of the historic decision: Dukharan, (Chairman) P M Steven, P Frank, D A Shah, S P Ram, A V Ram Narayan, B L R Dass, Shiu Charan, C William, G M Prakash, D S John, M Munam, Farzand Ali, J S Maiku, Ram Jati Singh, Ram Sundar, Rameshwar Prasad, Sher Mohammed, Badri Prasad, Kripa Masih, Andrew G Prasad and Dastgir and there were eight Fijian teachers there as well: M/s Logavatu, I Racule, Tevita, Asaeli, Kepuli, Jona, Maikeli, Isireli and Peni Tonga.Suva teachers who held their historic meeting to vote for amalgamation included the following: Sewak Masih (Chairman), Hakim Din, B Samuel Sharan, N S Deoki, J John, K P Singh, H R Ram Narayan, J R Lochan, S Bharat, R D Sharma, D P Mishra, Edward Rama, Hari Bhajan, Ami Chandra, Hari Pal, A D Sharma, J S Bhagwan, Hira Lal, B R Padarath, B H Sanjeu, John Bairagi, George Sukhdeo, Shiu Mangal, B Ram Singh and T R Sharma. Fijian teachers Phillip Cula, T Rawasalevu, W Tuiwaqa, Sairusi Natuna and Inoke Cakutini were also present.The meeting was co-chaired by Dukharan and Sewak Masih. The Conference adopted the motto of the Union with the slogan, “The Child Our Hope”. The Principal of Natabua Secondary C S Sharp officially opened the historic meeting and a secondary teacher E Mason presented a professional paper for discussion. W K Phillip presented the Annual Reports of the Unions. He had taken over the position of secretary from AG Prasad who had resigned earlier in the year.|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to compare Soil Conservation Service and Forest Service methods for determining range condition, to develop a method for determining range condition using plant frequency data and to develop range condition guides using Sorensen's coefficient of similarity. The final objective was to compare condition scores based on frequency data to Soil Conservation Service and Forest <b>Service</b> <b>condition</b> scores. Loamy upland and sandy loam upland range sites in the Empire Valley and Santa Rita Experimental Range of southeastern Arizona were sampled. Three prominent soil series of upland range sites within the study area were selected for study. Within each soil series, areas of apparent high, medium and low levels of past and present livestock use were sampled at three locations. Soil profile descriptions were made for each of the 27 sample areas and soil characteristics were used to confirm soil series sampled. Plant communities were sampled by weight estimates, Parker 3 -step transects and 40 x 40 cm frequency plots. Forest Service and Soil Conservation <b>Service</b> <b>condition</b> scores did not correlate well within the loamy upland or sandy loam upland range sites. Condition scores by both methods, especially for Forest Service data, are confounded with site potential. Cluster and factor analysis procedures identified plant groups associated with soil series, range site and sample location. Range condition was not identified as a criterion of plant group association. Sorensen's coefficient of similarity scores for frequency data based on a specific "high condition" reference area had a high coefficient of determination value when correlated with Soil Conservation <b>Service</b> <b>condition</b> scores for loamy upland range sites. Forest <b>Service</b> <b>condition</b> scores had a very low coefficient of determination value for the same comparison. Soil Conservation Service and Forest <b>Service</b> <b>condition</b> scores compared to similarity scores for frequency data for the sandy loam upland range site had positive but low coefficient of determination. Sorensen's coefficient of similarity, using frequency data as an index of condition, can be used to develop a range site condition guide for a homogeneous range site...|$|E

Therefore, the loop between investments in HR, training or improvement in <b>service</b> <b>conditions,</b> skilled labour, cost, LPI and profit is balancing. Skilled work force will reduce the time for doing logistics activities, which will also improve the LPI.
