40|$|Abstract: Balanced <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> {{excluding}} contiguous {{units are}} those <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> in which second order inclusion probabilities are zero for pairs of contiguous units and constant for pairs of non-contiguous units. Balanced <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> excluding contiguous units {{are useful for}} the situations where the contiguous units are similar. Even when contiguous units are not similar, with an appropriate ordering of units, balanced <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> {{are at least as}} efficient as simple random sampling without replacement. Some results on existence and construction of balanced <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> excluding contiguous units will be discussed in this presentation. The efficiency of these plans relative to other alternative plans will be illustrated {{with the help of an}} example...|$|R
5000|$|Cluster {{sampling}} is a <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> {{used when}} mutually homogeneous yet internally heterogeneous groupings {{are evident in}} a statistical population. It is often used in marketing research. In this <b>sampling</b> <b>plan,</b> the total population is divided into these groups (known as clusters) and a simple random sample of the groups is selected. The elements in each cluster are then sampled. If all elements in each sampled cluster are sampled, then this {{is referred to as}} a [...] "one-stage" [...] cluster <b>sampling</b> <b>plan.</b> If a simple random subsample of elements is selected within each of these groups, this is referred to as a [...] "two-stage" [...] cluster <b>sampling</b> <b>plan.</b> A common motivation for cluster sampling is to reduce the total number of interviews and costs given the desired accuracy. For a fixed sample size, the expected random error is smaller when most of the variation in the population is present internally within the groups, and not between the groups.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of chain sampling is examined through matching of operating characteristics (OC) curves of chain <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> (ChSP) with single and double <b>sampling</b> <b>plans.</b> In particular, the operating characteristics of some ChSP- 0, 3 and 1, 3 {{as well as}} ChSP- 0, 4 and 1, 4 are presented, where the number pairs represent {{the first and the}} second cumulative acceptance numbers. The fact that the ChSP procedure uses cumulative results from two or more samples and that the parameters can be varied to produce a wide variety of operating characteristics raises the question whether it may be possible for such plans to provide a given protection with less inspection than with single or double <b>sampling</b> <b>plans.</b> The operating ratio values reported illustrate the possibilities of matching single and double <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> with ChSP. It is shown that chain <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> provide improved efficiency over single and double <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> having substantially the same operating characteristics...|$|R

30|$|Single <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> are {{ubiquitous}} in practically all industries {{and are the}} focus of this article. Double and multiple stage <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> may be less risky in a theoretical sense showing a lower probability of sampling error, however, applications on the shop floor require intensive training and the learning curve is uncomfortably steep. Single <b>sampling</b> <b>plans,</b> on the other hand, will reduce costs significantly and even bring a new dynamic to the factory. The elimination of costly 100 % total inspection will enhance the adoption of modern management techniques in general, and help to make negotiations between buyers and sellers more transparent and organized. Our intention is to show how to improve standard <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> like the ISO standards (1999, 1985) by recalculating tables with the hypergeometric distribution, and more importantly taking into account the correct usage of hypothesis testing. All major and most emerging economies have similar standards.

40|$|Lot-by-Lot {{acceptance}} <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> {{provide the}} practitioner with decision rules for acceptance or rejection of a current delivery. Acceptance <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> {{can be classified}} into variable plans when features from the lot are measured on numerical scale and attributive plans when features are measured that classify items as defective or non-defective. We will treat the case where sampling takes place from lots that are coming from a supplier's process which is of high quality, i. e. a proportion defects near zero is associated to the process. Traditional <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> won't work in this case since any sample of reasonable size will probably contain zero defects. We will propose a generalization of the modified chain <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> proposed in [1] that is applicable for as well attributive as variable inspection. For this purpose, {{it is assumed that}} lots are drawn from a continuing stream of lots of a process with an unknown but constant fraction defects. Chain <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> are able to accumulate information from samples drawn from historical lots to estimate the suppliers quality. The proposed plans allow to go further into history than the standard chain <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> of Dodge [2]. In contrast to zero acceptance number single <b>sampling</b> <b>plans,</b> this enables the design of steep operating characteristic (OC) -curves that possess an inflection point near zero. Algorithms will be proposed to design the proposed plans when the OC-curve have to pass through two predetermined points that define producerâs and consumerâs risk. Experiments will show that for small fraction defects the required sample size is smaller compared to the classical chain <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> of Dodge. status: publishe...|$|R
