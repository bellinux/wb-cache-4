5|$|Another major {{challenge}} {{that came up}} in production was who Monk's new psychiatrist would be. Several ideas included a woman, <b>someone</b> too strict or too nice, <b>someone</b> driven crazy by Monk's compulsions, and even <b>someone</b> who would give Monk scream therapy. The eventual decision came from writer Jonathan Collier, who suggested a one-armed psychiatrist. Shalhoub liked the idea, but required that they recruit an actual one-armed actor to play Dr. Sorenson. The Screen Actors Guild actually had several actors waiting to audition, and the part was given to Rick Curry.|$|E

5|$|Black Christmas {{has three}} {{alternate}} endings, {{the second of}} which {{was used as the}} actual ending for the UK theatrical release of the movie. In the UK ending, Billy dies on the operating table from his wounds, thus when Kelli kills Agnes, the scene ends there with her parents picking her up from the hospital. The third ending is similar, having Billy die and Kelli's parents picking her up, however his body disappears and the last shot shows <b>someone</b> moving through the vents, indicating that either Agnes or Billy are still alive. The first ending, which follows the original script, ends with both Kelli and Leigh surviving and Kelli getting a call from <b>someone</b> using Kyle's cellphone.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} pre-revolution articles to link the death of Saeed to an imminent nationwide explosion came from Saeed's neighbor, Egyptian-Australian Amro Ali. In an opinion piece titled , Ali writes an intimate portrayal of Saeed and the Alexandria context, {{as well as the}} ramifications of his death for the regime. Ali states [...] "Saeed's tragedy is Egypt's tragedy. A young man, neither a political activist nor religious radical, but an ordinary Egyptian whose accused actions could not in any way warrant his lynching. Saeed was <b>someone's</b> son, <b>someone's</b> brother, <b>someone's</b> friend, <b>someone's</b> neighbour, <b>someone's</b> customer, and if not for what had happened, <b>someone's</b> future. Saeed was, in the local vernacular, a son of Cleopatra [...] Yet the system that was supposed to protect him and give him his rights, took away those rights by taking away his life... It is one extra nail in the coffin of the ever-widening gulf between the ruler and ruled... What the Egyptian establishment maybe forgetting... is that pigeons come home to roost more than once." [...] Ali would later publish a personal and analytical account in Jadaliyya on the second anniversary of Saeed's death: [...] As well as analysing what really happened to Saeed, Ali also examines the dynamics of how Saeed was rapidly mythologized and the ramifications it has produced in Egyptian society.|$|R
