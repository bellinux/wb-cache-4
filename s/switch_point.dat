25|$|The {{block system}} handles all control and {{supervision}} of routes through interlockings including <b>switch</b> (<b>point)</b> control and switch status, for broken rail protection, and tracking of trains with failed (or not equipped for) CBTC. CBTC lines are fully track circuited with power frequency, single-rail track circuits. (Broken-rail protection is only guaranteed {{on one of}} the two rails, however.) Equipment aboard every train identifies the location of the train using wayside transponders as a basis. Once the Zone Controller has determined, based on track circuit information and train localization, that the CBTC train is a single discrete train ("sieved"). The Wayside Zone Controller uses this information to grant movement authorities based on conditions ahead. The CBTC Zone Controller functions then as an overlay which only provides safe separation of trains and cannot do so without interaction from the Wasyide (Legacy) Signaling system. Trains, with CBTC, can then operate closer together, although as before, platform dwell times and train performance are the true limiting factors in terms of headway performance. With the new system, signals and interlockings are still absolutely required, their job being done better by relay interlockings or Solid State Interlocking controllers. The ATS system at the Control Center is not a vital (life-safety) system and serves only to automate the routing of trains based on the overall timetable. The location of the train is also used to inform passengers of arrival times. The MTA's form of CBTC uses a reduced form of the old fixed-block signaling system, requiring that both be maintained at high cost.|$|E

Unshielded cable can result in noisy readings for low current and high resistance applications, especially if the cabling runs adjacent to equipment generating electromagnetic interference.|$|E

5000|$|A second {{proposed}} {{model for}} the maintenance of alternative mating behaviors is status-dependent selection. This describes a conditional strategy in which the fitness of alternative phenotypes depend on the status, or competitive ability, of an individual. [...] Status includes environmental and genetic factors as well as age and size, and determines the level of fitness that may be obtained from a given phenotype. As shown in Figure 1, the fitness benefits of a given phenotype vary based on whether an individual is of high or low status. In a case where two phenotypes and strategies are possible, such as mate guarding or sneaking, there will be an intermediate point of intersection where the fitness gained from these alternative behaviors will be equivalent. At this point (s), the fitness gained from these strategies will be equal, and the particular strategy employed at a given time will depend on an individual’s status. A low status individual below the <b>switch</b> <b>point</b> will obtain higher fitness with phenotype B, while an individual of high status above the <b>switch</b> <b>point</b> will benefit from higher fitness with phenotype A. Such a model shows how individuals of lesser status or competitive ability may maximize their fitness by exhibiting an alternative phenotype. In this manner, these selective forces will maintain the phenotypic diversity observed among animals with respect to mating behavior, though strategies utilized will depend on a variety of circumstances.|$|E
50|$|In B. terricola, {{there are}} three phases of colony development. The first phase, known as colony initiation, begins when a solitary queen starts to produce her first workers by laying diploid eggs. This leads to further eusociality within the colony and the queen’s {{continued}} efforts to produce more worker bees. The emergence of workers is essential for colony growth.The onset of the second phase, known as the <b>switch</b> <b>point,</b> is when the queen stops laying diploid eggs and starts making haploid eggs to produce male bees. During the third phase, the workers exhibit overt aggression towards each other and towards the queen. The beginning of the third phase {{is known as the}} competition point. Reciprocal oophagy also occurs during this third stage.|$|E

Also known as Bacon Switch, the site was once a thriving railroad <b>switch</b> <b>point</b> in the late 19th century. The site between Delmar, Delaware and Laurel, Delaware had a number of small stores. It was named after the Bacon family, who started a farm there, before expanding into the sawmill and basket making business. Parents Thomas and Amelia Bacon, had five sons: Frank, Albert, Thomas, William and Harry. The son Thomas designed a collapsible egg carrier in 1884 that was granted a US Patent, number 299715 http://www.google.com/patents?id=yTtrAAAAEBAJ&printsec=abstract&zoom=4#v=onepage&q&f=false,299715.

50|$|This {{first phase}} can last a {{variable}} {{amount of time}} in B. terrestris, after which a <b>switch</b> <b>point</b> is reached, and the queen begins to lay some unfertilized eggs, which develop into males. When the male drones emerge from the nest, they do not return, foraging only for themselves. They seek out emerging queens and mate with them. The remaining diploid eggs hatch into larvae that receive extra food and pupate to become new queens. The queen can use pheromones to discourage the workers' inclination to invest more in these larvae, thereby ensuring that not too many become queens. The resolution of this worker/queen conflict can be complex and is discussed below. The colony persists until fall in temperate zones and then workers begin to lay unfertilized eggs that if they mature will become males. At this point, outright aggression among workers and between the queen and workers begins. This is a predictable time point that occurs about 30 days into the colony cycle in very temperate climates.|$|E
5000|$|Providers use SS7 {{to route}} calls {{throughout}} the US/Canada network. SS7 accesses databases for various {{services such as}} CNAM, LIDB, Custom Local Area Signaling Services (CLASS) and LNP. Calls to ported numbers are completed when a customer who calls a ported number sends the dialed number to a provider's SSP (Service <b>Switch</b> <b>Point),</b> where it is identified either as a local call or not. If the call is local, the switch has the NPA-NXX in its routing table as portable, so it sends a routing request to the Signal Transfer Point (STP) which accesses a local database that is updated by an LSMS (Local Service Management System) which holds all routing for all ported numbers to which the carrier is responsible for completing calls. If routing information is found, a response {{is sent to the}} [...] "query" [...] containing the information necessary to properly route the call. If it is not a local number, the call is passed on to the STP and routed until it gets to a local carrier who will perform the [...] "query" [...] mentioned earlier and route the call accordingly.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{variability}} in the <b>switch</b> <b>point</b> to male production from worker production of B. terrestris colonies, there are varying levels of sex ratios among nests. Early-switching colonies have a much smaller number of future queens compared to males (1:17.4), which may give them a competitive advantage in mating with later emerging queens. Late-switching colonies have fewer males and a more even sex ratio of 1:1:3, thus indicating the queen's control over her colony (she prefers a 1:1 ratio, since she is equally related to both sons and daughters). On the other hand, workers prefer a 3:1 ratio, as they are more {{related to each other}} than to their mother. Although early and late switching colonies are usually balanced equally in numbers in the population, the overall demographic in one study was found to be male biased, resulting in an overall sex ratio of 1:4 (female to males). However, most studies show that this balance of bimodal sex determination between early and late-switching colonies creates the queen's preferred 1:1 sex ratio in B. terrestris populations. This is unusual for monogamous social insects, which usually have a 3:1 sex ratio indicative of worker colony control. B. terrestris often does not conform to standard predictions of sex ratios based on evolutionary theory and haplodiploid theory.|$|E
