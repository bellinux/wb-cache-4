5|$|Green tea: This tea has {{undergone}} {{the least amount}} of oxidation. The oxidation process is halted by the quick application of heat after tea picking, either with steam, the method preferred in Japan, or by dry roasting and cooking in hot pans, preferred in Chinese tea processing. Tea leaves may be left to dry as separate leaves or they may be rolled into small pellets to make gunpowder tea. This process is time consuming and is typically done with pekoes of higher quality. The tea is processed within one to two days of harvesting, and if done correctly retains most of the chemical composition of the fresh leaves from which it was produced. Variation in <b>steaming</b> <b>time</b> for fixation or processing from additional stages of rolling and drying are sometimes used to improve or altering the flavour for types of green tea. Green tea leaves undergo fixation by either roasting (panning) or steaming. Generally, roasted varieties are richer in flavor, while steamed varieties are more vivid in color.|$|E

5000|$|Surface {{steaming}} {{with special}} sheets (sheet steaming) {{is a method}} which has been established for decades in order to steam large areas reaching from 15 to 400 m² in one step. If properly applied, sheet steaming is simple and highly economic. The usage of heat resistant, non-decomposing insulation fleece saves up to 50% energy, reduces the <b>steaming</b> <b>time</b> significantly and improves penetration. Single working step areas up to 400 m² can be steamed in 4-5 hours down to 25-30 cm depth / 90 °C. The usage of heat resistant and non-decomposing synthetic insulation fleece, 5 mm thick, 500 gr / m², can reduce <b>steaming</b> <b>time</b> by about 30%. Through a steam injector or a perforated pipe, steam is injected underneath the sheet {{after it has been}} laid out and weighted with sand sacks.|$|E

5000|$|Sandwich {{steaming}} {{offers several}} advantages. On the one hand, application of energy {{can be increased}} to up to 120 kg steam per m²/h. In comparison to other steaming methods up to 30% energy savings can be achieved and the usage of fuel (e.g. heating oil) accordingly decreases.

The degree of starch gelatinization (DSG) and several quality attributes (head rice yield (HRY), color value and hardness) of parboiled rice were measured. Results showed that DSG (46. 8 %– 77. 9 %), color value (18. 08 – 19. 04) and hardness (118. 6 – 219. 2  N) all increased following steaming.

5000|$|The <b>steaming</b> <b>time</b> {{depends on}} soil {{structure}} {{as well as}} outside temperature and amounts to 1-1.5 hours per 10 cm steaming depth. Hereby the soil reaches a temperature of about 85 °C. Milling for soil loosening is not recommended since soil structure may become too fine which reduces its penetrability for steam. The usage of spading machines is ideal for soil loosening. The best results can be achieved if the soil is cloddy at greater depth and granulated at lesser depth.|$|E

5000|$|Peterhead bay and harbour {{became a}} major oil and gas port, {{servicing}} the offshore {{oil and gas industry}} in 1973, principally because of the deep water harbour and the short <b>steaming</b> <b>time</b> to the oil fields. [...] It was found out that the Scottish Secretary of State had responsibility for the harbour, in an 1886 act, that prohibited development in the harbour, except as a Haven of Refuge. A bill was introduced in May 1972 permitting other uses. The Scottish Office and Sidlaw Industries, an Aberdeen company made an agreement to lease the harbour quay, and dredging began on January 1972, to increase the depth of the harbour areas. By 1973, a large investment was made to improve the harbour facilities and to facilitate the building of a gas and oil terminal. Oil and gas from the North Sea flow through Peterhead Bay.|$|E

50|$|The {{steaming}} area {{is covered}} with a special steaming sheet and weighted all around as with sheet steaming. The steam is injected underneath the sheet through an injector and protection tunnel. While with short areas up to 30 m length steam is frontally injected, with longer areas steam is induced {{in the middle of the}} beet using a T-connection branching out to both sides. As soon as the sheet is inflated to approximately 1 m by the steam pressure, the suction turbine is switched on. First, the air in the soil is removed via the suction hoses. A partial vacuum is formed and the steam is pulled downward. During the final phase, when the required steaming depth has been reached, the ventilator runs non-stop and surplus steam is blown out. To ensure that this surplus steam is not lost, it is fed back under the sheet. As with all other steaming systems, a post-steaming period of approximately 20-30 minutes is required. <b>Steaming</b> <b>time</b> is approximately 1 hour per 10 cm steaming depth. The steam requirement is approximately 7-8 kg/m². The most important requirement, as with all steaming systems, is that the soil is well loosened before steaming, to ensure optimal penetration.|$|E
