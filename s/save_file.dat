5|$|Chrono Cross {{features}} a diverse cast of 45 party members. Each character is outfitted with an innate Element affinity and three unique special abilities that are learned over time. If {{taken to the}} world opposite their own, characters react to their counterparts (if available). Many characters tie in to crucial plot events. Since {{it is impossible to}} obtain all 45 characters in one playthrough, players must replay the game to witness everything. Through use of the New Game+ feature, players can ultimately obtain all characters on one <b>save</b> <b>file.</b>|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} in May 2011 that Square Enix will be releasing Dragon Quest III in Japan, as both the Famicom and Super Famicom ports {{as part of the}} September released of Dragon Quest 25th Anniversary Commemoration Famicom & Super Famicom Dragon Quest I & II & III for the Wii. A quick save feature was added to this version of the game, allowing for pauses at any time, but the <b>save</b> <b>file</b> is deleted upon resuming.|$|E
5|$|The game engine has {{had major}} {{performance}} {{issues on the}} PlayStation 3. These issues have led to unplayable frame-rates when the save game file gets too big or when DLC is installed. Due {{to the nature of}} the game, the longer the player plays, the larger the <b>save</b> <b>file</b> becomes. These same issues plagued , but a performance patch to improve New Vegas seems unlikely. Sawyer said that it is a core-engine issue that can not be so easily patched.|$|E

5|$|Outside {{the main}} campaign, players can {{battle against the}} game's {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) in the Link Arena: after building a team and placing a wager, the player fights a battle against their own units controlled by the game AI. Fire Emblem also features a Link Arena multiplayer option in which up to four players can link up and do battle with teams of characters from the single-player <b>save</b> <b>file.</b> Players choose up to five characters and equip them like in the main story. During battle, each player takes turns to attack with one character. Weapons selected automatically for each battle Victory is determined either by surviving {{a period of time}} or aggregating the highest number of points.|$|E
5|$|Destruction Derby is a {{vehicular}} combat racing {{video game}} developed by Reflections Interactive {{and published by}} Psygnosis. Based on the sport of demolition derby, the game tasks the player with racing and destroying cars to score points. The developers implemented simulated physics to make the results of collisions easier to predict, and they kept the game's tracks small {{to increase the number}} of wrecks. Versions of Destruction Derby were released for MS-DOS, PlayStation and Sega Saturn. A Nintendo 64 version, Destruction Derby 64, was released in 1999 by Looking Glass Studios and THQ. Critics found Destruction Derby enjoyable and they praised its graphics and car damage system, but the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn releases received mixed reviews. It doesn't work fully on all PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 models due to game <b>save</b> <b>file</b> issues. The game started the Destruction Derby franchise, beginning with its 1996 sequel, Destruction Derby 2.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Legend of Mana displays an angled top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls the unnamed main character, and is assisted by up to two companions. One of these companions is an optional support character, which depends on what quest the player is performing, while another companion can be chosen by the player out of a roster of monsters, pets, and golems. Both companions are typically controlled by the game's AI, though a second player can {{take control of the}} support character, or load in their own character from a different <b>save</b> <b>file,</b> if present. The main character and companions each have their own set of numerical attributes including hit points and strength, which represent the amount of damage the player can take or cause. These stats grow whenever the player advances a level, after gaining enough experience points from battle with enemies.|$|E

50|$|Jak X {{deviates}} {{from the}} series more traditional style of gameplay, adapting into the racing genre, {{and is based}} on the driving mechanics developed for Jak 3. Several extras can be unlocked for Jak X and Daxter by linking up the <b>save</b> <b>files</b> from the two respective games, and several player skins can be unlocked if the player has <b>save</b> <b>files</b> from The Precursor Legacy, Jak II, Jak 3 and Insomniac Games Ratchet: Deadlocked.|$|R
5|$|One notable {{omission}} was {{the removal}} of the cutscene prior to the Psycho Mantis battle in which he reads the player's memory card and activates the vibration function of the player's controller if a DualShock is being used, as this scene involved the use of PlayStation-specific peripherals. The method for defeating Mantis was also changed from using the second controller to simply using the keyboard (regardless of whether the player was using a game controller or not up to that point). Other omissions include {{the removal of}} the eighth Codec frequency (140.07), which featured written commentaries by the developers, Meryl's alternate sneaking suit outfit, and the mission logs when loading a <b>save</b> <b>file.</b> However, the PC version adds the option to toggle moving and shooting in first-person view mode at any time regardless of difficulty setting, and players can now save their progress at any point without contacting Mei-Ling through the use of quick saves. On the VR training portion, all 300 missions, as well as the photoshoot mode, are available from the start, although the three unlockable preview trailers from the PlayStation version have been removed.|$|E
25|$|The 1996 PlayStation {{version of}} Policenauts {{could read the}} memory card and give some easter egg dialogues if a <b>save</b> <b>file</b> of Konami's dating sim Tokimeki Memorial is present, a {{technique}} Kojima would also later use in Metal Gear Solid.|$|E
25|$|In combat, {{the player}} can manage the ship's systems by distributing power, order crew to {{specific}} stations or rooms to repair damage, and fire weapons at the enemy ship. Successful weapon strikes by either side can damage systems, disabling their functions until repaired by crew; cause hull breaches that vent air into space until patched by crew; ignite fires that spread and damage both {{systems and the}} hull until they are extinguished by crew or starved of oxygen; and inflict direct hull damage, which reduces the ship's hull points. A ship is destroyed once its hull points are reduced to zero, or defeated once its crew is eliminated. A player victory earns resources for bartering, upgrading, or combat; an enemy victory results in game failure, deleting the <b>save</b> <b>file</b> and forcing the player to start over, creating {{a high level of}} difficulty. Alternatively, the player may evade combat by jumping to another waypoint after the ship's engines have fully charged.|$|E
5000|$|Gnumeric {{can both}} open and <b>save</b> <b>files</b> in this format {{and plans to}} {{continue}} to support this format in the future.|$|R
50|$|OpenOffice.org Writer <b>saves</b> <b>files</b> in an XML format. However, the {{resultant}} file is a binary {{since it is}} compressed (a tarball equivalent).|$|R
50|$|As {{in other}} rogue-like games, NetHack {{features}} permadeath: expired characters cannot be revived without having made backup {{copies of the}} actual <b>save</b> <b>files.</b>|$|R
500|$|When a unit {{falls in}} battle, they are {{subjected}} to permanent death, removing them {{from the rest of}} the campaign unless the player restarts the game from a previous <b>save</b> <b>file.</b> [...] Some character deaths, such as those of Eirika and Ephraim, end the game and require a restart from a <b>save</b> <b>file.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{player can}} achieve a 102% {{completion}} score for their <b>save</b> <b>file</b> by completing all levels and bosses, completing all bonus challenges, collecting all DK coins within the Lost World and visiting the four Kong family members at least once.|$|E
500|$|Going Commando {{introduces}} eighteen new weapons, {{such as the}} Blitz Gun, Seeker and Lava Gun. Each weapon has a [...] "growth bar", {{which increases}} when the weapon is used to defeat enemies. The weapon is upgraded once the bar is filled, increasing its power and changing the design of it. Certain devices from the original Ratchet & Clank make a return, such as the Swingshot, while others are new to Going Commando. The player can use a <b>save</b> <b>file</b> from the original Ratchet & Clank to get [...] "retro" [...] weapons from the first game for free.|$|E
5000|$|Before GarageBand 10, {{there was}} no MIDI export option, and the only option was to <b>save</b> <b>files</b> as [...]band or export to iTunes.|$|R
50|$|After {{all this}} is done, the file (or files) are ready to export (or save) in {{whatever}} form the user desires. Almost all wave editing applications have the default ability to <b>save</b> <b>files</b> in WAV form, and some can also <b>save</b> <b>files</b> as MP3, FLAC, or in other formats. Many CD-R burning applications can then take these files and burn them onto a blank recordable disc {{in a form that}} can be played on a common CD player (using the standard CD-DA format).|$|R
50|$|Being a KDE application, Kate transparently {{opens and}} <b>saves</b> <b>files</b> over all {{protocols}} supported by KIO libraries. This includes HTTP, FTP, SSH, SMB and WebDAV, among others.|$|R
500|$|The game can {{be played}} on higher {{difficulty}} levels: Classic (in {{a reference to the}} original game) and Impossible, each with the option to enable the [...] "Ironman" [...] option (which limits players to a single <b>save</b> <b>file)</b> separately for each. Jake Solomon, lead developer, stated on numerous occasions that he believes that the [...] "truest XCOM experience" [...] is playing without the ability to reload saved games. On the higher difficulty levels, the random nature of battles, where soldiers under the player's command can permanently die from one enemy attack, the against-all-odds nature of combat against the unknown and technologically superior enemy, and the requirement to sacrifice some resources – including soldiers and even entire countries – for the greater good combine to create a bleak atmosphere where the player feels the weight of command.|$|E
500|$|Nintendo also {{published}} supplementary media to unlock additional content. Pre-ordered {{copies of the}} game came with a bonus disc that contains trailers for {{the game and the}} film [...] The North American disc also contains the exclusive Pokémon Jirachi that can be downloaded to the player's copy of Ruby or Sapphire. The Japanese release contains a downloadable Celebi instead and requires a completed <b>save</b> <b>file</b> of Pokémon Colosseum. The disc also updates the software in Ruby and Sapphire to remove a [...] "berry glitch" [...] discovered in 2003. Despite public anticipation the Bonus Disc was not released in PAL territories, prompting Nintendo to issue an official apology. However a Jirachi was later included in the PAL version of the game Pokémon Channel. In Japan, scannable cards for the Nintendo e-Reader were available for purchase that featured additional trainers to battle and Shadow Pokémon.|$|E
500|$|Radiant Dawn {{retains the}} [...] of Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, with turn-based battles {{taking place on}} a square-based grid. Most of the Path of Radiance cast returns, {{including}} all of its playable characters (except [...] ), as well as figures new to Tellius. Data from a completed Path of Radiance <b>save</b> <b>file</b> can be transferred to Radiant Dawn via a Nintendo GameCube memory card, {{which can lead to}} characters obtaining statistical gains. Support conversations from Path of Radiance can also be accessed and viewed using this method. In Radiant Dawn, the [...] "support" [...] system has been altered so that a unit can support any other unit, although units can only have one support relationship each. A secondary support known as a [...] "bond" [...] is also available, which is active by default or obtained when two units have attained an [...] "A" [...] support level in Path of Radiance.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{aspects of}} {{gameplay}} in Mass Effect 3 are impacted by choices made in previous games. When {{starting a new}} game, players with <b>saved</b> <b>files</b> from Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 are given the option of importing them into Mass Effect 3 to reflect these choices. If a <b>saved</b> <b>file</b> is imported, over 1000 variables are pulled to help shape how the final chapter is experienced. If no <b>saved</b> <b>files</b> are available, there is an origin-story comic (similar to that in Mass Effect 2) to help new players make quick decisions. Imported characters' appearance and class are changeable, with more features and hair-styles included in the character creator than in Mass Effect 2. Commander Shepard always starts the game with some powers. Upon finishing the game, a New Game+ option allows players to continue playing after the main story ends, starting again with their finished Shepard to collect items they missed the first time around. The game has 82 minutes of cut-scenes.|$|R

500|$|...hack simulates an MMORPG; players {{assume the}} role of a {{participant}} in a fictional game called The World. The player controls the on-screen player character Kite from a third-person perspective but first-person mode is available. The player manually controls the viewing perspective using the game controller. Within the fictional game, players explore monster-infested fields and dungeons, and [...] "Root Towns" [...] that are free of combat. They can also log off from The World and return to a computer desktop interface which includes in-game e-mail, news, message boards, and desktop and background music customization options. The player may save the game to a memory card both from the desktop and within The World at a Save Shop. A Data Flag appears on the <b>save</b> <b>file</b> after the player completes the game, allowing the transfer of all aspects of the player character and party members to the next game in the series.|$|E
500|$|The game {{features}} downloadable content (DLC) in {{the form}} of downloadable outfits, weapons, accessories, scenarios, recruitable monsters and minigames. Although there had been initial plans to release DLC for Final Fantasy XIII, these ideas did not come to fruition. For Final Fantasy XIII-2, the team designed and planned for content, including DLC, that would expand on the game since the beginning of its development. Players who own Final Fantasy XIII save data can unlock an additional wallpaper (PS3) or gamer picture (Xbox 360) for the <b>save</b> <b>file.</b> DLC released after the game contained additional weapons, costumes, and monsters. Post-release downloads also included [...] "Final Fantasy XIII Lost Report", which offers a look back at Final Fantasy XIIIs story through the perspective of non-playable characters from the game, and three downloadable scenarios for other characters: [...] "Perpetual Battlefield", which reveals Snow's fate; [...] "Heads or Tails", which shows how Sazh came to 500 AF Academia; and [...] "Requiem of the Goddess", which shows Lightning's struggle against Caius and explains how she became crystallized in the main story's ending.|$|E
500|$|Localizing {{backgrounds}} {{was more}} difficult {{than it had been}} in previous games: while the earlier games used 2D illustrations as backgrounds, which could be changed, Dual Destinies uses 3D models, hindering the localization team from changing the shape of objects without risking encountering bugs. Because of this, Hsu described some objects as not feeling [...] "right"; the most prominent type of object affected by this was signs with vertical text, which she said did not feel as natural in English as in Japanese. Some aspects of the user interface had to be modified as part of the localization: for instance, some text had to be moved around on the <b>save</b> <b>file</b> screen because of some words being longer in English than in Japanese, and a smaller font was chosen for the investigation notes to allow for multiple lines of text. For the dialogue box, a thin condensed font was chosen, and the box itself was elongated, to make room for as much text as in previous games. They only used two lines of text for it, both to look visually pleasing and to avoid hiding important detail behind a taller box.|$|E
5000|$|The A/36 8" [...] {{diskette}} {{drive is}} optional and was marketed for approximately US$1,000. It was {{the easiest way}} to <b>save</b> <b>files</b> or programs from an A/36 and restore on a S/36.|$|R
50|$|Popular interpreters include Nitfol and Frotz. Nitfol {{makes use}} of the Glk API, and {{supports}} versions 1 through 8 of the Z-machine, including the version 6 graphical Z-machine. <b>Save</b> <b>files</b> are stored in the standard Quetzal <b>save</b> format. Binary <b>files</b> are currently available for several different operating systems, including Macintosh, Linux, DOS, and Windows.|$|R
50|$|It <b>saves</b> <b>files</b> with a {{resolution}} of 1440 * 1080i. The video format specifies a rectangular pixel shape. Most players render this as 1920 * 1080 format after adjusting for the rectangular pixels.|$|R
