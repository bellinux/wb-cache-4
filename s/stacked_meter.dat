40|$|The Latemar Massif is an exhumed {{carbonate}} platform in the Dolomites of Northern Italy that was deposited during the Ladinian {{stage of the}} Middle Triassic. The platform interior is comprised of hundreds of vertically <b>stacked,</b> <b>meter</b> scale, subtidal limestone/vadose cap carbonate cycles ('Latemar couplets') arranged into upward thinning bundles of 5. The individual couplets are interpreted as the products of sea level oscillations occurring with an approximately 20, 000 year periodicity; the 5 : 1 bundling is indicative of a lower order approximately 100, 000 year modulating component. This combination of cycling is interpreted as a platform response to precession forcing with the 5 : 1 bundling an expression of modulation by the eccentricity. Spectral analysis confirms {{the significance of the}} 5 : 1 bundling, and identifies other significant bundling components related to other components of the eccentricity. The results show that the Latemar bundling spectrum is complex, with a splitting of components around the 1 percent bundling frequency, suggestive of the multiple component eccentricity in the 100, 000 year range. On the other hand, there is no direct evidence for the major 400, 000 year eccentricity component, although there is a dominant approximately 700, 000 year cycling in the buildup (a 35 : 1 bundling period). Other higher frequency bundling components may be related to obliquity forcing. Simple models are presented to argue for and against an astronomical origin of these cyclic platform carbonates...|$|E

50|$|The Mill Iron Site, {{located in}} Carter County, Montana and {{discovered}} in 1979, is a site {{belonging to the}} Goshen Complex. The site was excavated from 1984 to 1988. The excavation was also led by George C. Frison. 31 complete and broken Goshen points were found. 11 of these points {{were found in the}} campsite area, 12 were in the meat processing bed, and 7 were on the surface. This meat processing bed is thought to be a meat processing site rather than a kill site because it was a <b>stack</b> (4.5 <b>meters</b> in diameter) of single bison bones and other organized carcass parts. A large goshen point found in this meat processing bed is thought to have been used for ritual offerings rather than a weapon to kill animals. This is because of the carefully rounded tip, when typically a sharp point is made instead. Many other lithic blades were discovered in the Mill Iron Site in addition to the goshen points.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{accurate}} log volume measurement {{is a very}} important, especially in case of seaport volume control where logs are put in a huge <b>stack</b> of hundred <b>meters</b> length and a time for volume control is strongly restricted. Current technology of volume control use manual means such as measuring tape, so the process of measurement is rather inaccurate and time consuming. To estimate the volume of timber stack its frontal area is measured and some control parts of a stack are used for stacking coefficient (wood density in a stack) determination. Non-contact vision based technique is proposed for manual measurements substituting. The developed methods are implemented in portable photogrammetric system for stack parameters measuring and documenting...|$|R

40|$|On April 6, 1993, {{there was}} an {{uncontrolled}} release of radioactive material from the fuel reprocessing plant at the Siberian Chemical Combine in Tomsk. The release resulted from the rupture of an over-pressurized feed adjustment tank and subsequent explosion that destroyed the walls and roof of the operating gallery. Radioactive material was released through a 150 <b>meter</b> <b>stack,</b> {{as well as through}} the destroyed walls and roof. Relatively stable atmospheric conditions prevailed and a light snow was falling. The radiation release was not excessive, but the spread of radioactive material was compounded by the explosion. Radiation was detected about 26 km from the source. This paper summarizes the information available in the US regarding the release and, using reasonable assumptions, compares the calculated ground activity and radiation levels with the reported measured values...|$|R
40|$|In the {{aeration}} basins {{of sewage}} treatment plants, compressed air is supplied to diffusers {{near the bottom}} of tanks to aid in the conversion by aerobic bacteria of dissolved and suspended solids of sewage into particles that will settle. Air bubbles breaking at the air-water interface will aerosolize bacteria that concentrate in the uppermost microlayer. The microbiological output of a plant in New York City with such a system was monitored. Samples of the gaseous effluent were collected inside the aeration building, inside the building's <b>stack,</b> 300 <b>meters</b> upwind (background sampler), and 300 meters downwind (test sampler), using Andersen samplers. Among the genera identified in the atmosphere in and around the plant were Mycobacterium, Klebsiella, and Streptococcus, all potentially pathogenic. The disinfection power of ozone, which is generally used for odor control, was also tested. Samples were taken from the ozone mixing chamber in the stack of the thickentng tank building. No significant difference in general bacterial counts could be detected at different levels of ozone production. It appears that in the air, ozone is an ineffective bactericidal agent. Results in this preliminary study demonstrate the need to evaluate the hazard of microbial aerosols generated by sewage treatment plants similar to the one studied. The possibility of such hazards is of special interest where facilities are located upwind of populations especially susceptible to infections, because of age of debility.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The momentum equation governing mean longshore currents on straight beaches is {{a balance of}} forcing from the momentum transfer of the oscillatory wave motion, turbulent momentum transfer (mixing), and bottom stress. Of these, the wave's contribution is well understood, but the remaining two are not, principally due to the complicated hydrodynamics of the surf-zone. Addressing the bottom stress term, a longshore current model is developed which includes a modification of the bottom stress due {{to the effects of}} breaking-wave induced turbulence. A one-dimensional turbulent kinetic energy equation is used to model this breaking-wave induced turbulence, producing a spatially varying bottom friction coefficient. The modeled longshore current cross-shore profiles show improved agreement with field observations. In a second bottom stress study, vertical profiles of mean longshore currents are examined using field data obtained with vertically <b>stacked</b> electromagnetic current <b>meters</b> with the goal of measuring the bottom stress and its associated drag coefficient. The profiles are observed to become vertically uniform whenever the ratio of wave height to depth exceeds 0. 3, indicating that nearly all of the waves passing a given location are breaking. Finally, horizontal turbulent momentum transfer (mixing) is examined for the case of shear instabilities of the longshore current. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|The nature, {{origin and}} {{evolution}} of the polar layered terrains are a major mystery of Martian climate. Almost every aspect of these enigmatic terrains surrounding, and probably underlying, the polar residual ice caps is in contention. Are the polar laminae forming today? Are they inactive or even eroding, being mere relics of the past? Are {{the north and south}} polar layered terrains fundamentally different in composition, age or process? Are they a physical record of past, possibly cyclic, climate change and, if so, can we learn to read that record? We know from past Mariner 9 and Viking orbital observations that there are layered terrains at high latitudes, defined by alternating bands of visually lighter and darker material appearing in <b>stacks</b> hundreds of <b>meters</b> thick with individual bands as thin as could then be resolved (tens of meters). In this talk, aspects of the polar layered terrains will be reviewed with emphasis on issues likely to be addressed with data from ongoing and near-term flight missions to Mars. Particular attention will be given to what might be learned from observing the present seasonal cycles of dust, water and carbon dioxide on Mars, in conjunction with in situ data from one site on the south polar layered terrain...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a {{communication}} stack for powerline communication (PLC) based on open standards. Our {{aim is to}} provide interoperability features regarding others media with a robust and reliable communication <b>stack</b> for smart <b>metering,</b> home control or home area network applications. Our work {{is based on the}} adaptation of the IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard protocol over PLC. It is constrained by the low-power, lossy and low data-rate context of powerline transceiver that uses pulse modulation. We first make a quick survey and justify the use of the IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard over PLC by drawing a parallel with Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPAN). We then focus on the convergence of the IPv 6 protocol at the network level, with the 6 LoWPAN adaptation. We present our initial implementation of the RPL setup and routing protocol. This allows for a full network layer stack and results in efficient routing in our low power, low data-rate and lossy network context. We then present a real testbed of this stack and the step by step validation of its performance with experiments of data exchanges between PLC nodes. Finally we present interoperability tests performed between wireless and PLC nodes. We conclude about the interest of such interoperability for the real usage of sensor networks with a feedback from field's applications deployment and our future work...|$|R

In this paper, we investigate {{the possibility of using}} IPv 6 for sensor networks connected through powerline communication (PLC) non-wireless mediums and demonstrate possible interoperability. Our work is based on the adaptation of the IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard protocol. It is constrained by the low-power, lossy and low data-rate context of powerline transceiver that uses pulse modulation. Our aim is to provide interoperability features regarding others mediums with a robust and reliable communication <b>stack</b> for smart <b>metering,</b> home control or home area networks applications. This document propose the first adaptation of the IEEE 802. 15. 4 commons standard on PLC medium. Following this standard interface, we demonstrate the possibility to carry out data on PLC with great reliability, and low power energy requirement using our WPCTMphysical layer (standing for Watt Pulse Communication (WPC)). Relying on this adaptation, we then focus on the convergence of the IPv 6 protocol at the network level, with the 6 LoWPAN adaptation. We also present our initial implementation of the RPL setup and routing protocol. This allows for a full network layer stack and results in efficient routing in our low power, low data-rate and lossy network context. Thus, we finally demonstrate interoperability with a real testbed between powerline and wireless sensor networks running IEEE 802. 15. 4 / 6 LoWPAN/IPv 6 /RPL stacks.

40|$|Modern tendencies for {{assessment}} of high-rise building deformation state presuppose creation of automated and regular monitoring while using highly-accurate space positioning systems (GPS-systems), a robotic electronic tacheometer, highlyaccurate inclinators (Leica Nivel 210 /Nivel 220 -model) with measuring accuracy of tilt angle up to 0. 09 s, Geomos software complex (Leica Geosystems). Automated system for deformation monitoring requires significant time and material expenditures, special training of specialists so simpler methods and criteria {{for assessment}} of building deformation state are also considered as rather actual for this purpose. There {{are more than}} ten conventional methods for determining building tilt. All these methods are based on angular measurements from the fixed base while using highly-accurate theodolites. The methods are rather labor-consuming {{and they do not}} provide operational efficiency and accuracy in measurements. Introduction of electronic tacheometers with large radius of refractorless measurements of distances has made it possible to calculate coordinates on the building surface with high accuracy and at various sections (heights) that results in possibility to obtain 3 D model of the building surface. Leica TCRA 1201 tacheometer has been set at the good visibility point of a tower construction, device orientation and plane coordinates of the temporary point have been determined with the purpose to assess a tilt value of an exhaust <b>stack</b> having 150 <b>meter</b> height. Then 3 D coordinates of six points on the building surface have been measured for every stack section. After that these points have been projected on the horizontal plane. LISCAD PLUS software complex has been used for processing and interpretation of geodetic data. The proposed method permits to obtain data for determination value and direction of a tower construction tilt, immediately carry out in-situ measurements and obtain final results in the automatic mode of LISCAD PLUS software complex using only one point of the tacheometer setting. The method does not require any preliminary laying and subsequent preservation of fundamental geodetic points (bases) and it can be applied for any configuration of tower constructions. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Upper Devonian Leduc, Nisku and Wabamun/Stettler {{formations}} (Frasnian and Famennian) were {{deposited on}} extensive carbonate platforms, and form three unconformity bounded megasequences, characterized by <b>stacked</b> shallowing upward <b>meter</b> {{to tens of}} meter-scale paracycles. Carbonates interbedded with evaporites have been extensively dolomitized. Four types of dolomites are recognized. Microcrystalline dolomites are interpreted to be of sabkha origin, characterized by fine crystals (2 [...] 70 mum) and are in part mudcracked, brecciated and contain quartz silts. Sucrosic dolomites (20 [...] 130 mum) commonly have dusty cores with clear rims. Mosaic dolomite crystals (10 [...] 140 mum) are interlocked. Dolomite rhombs (30 [...] 70 mum) occur in partially dolomitized limestones. Sabkha, sucrosic and mosaic dolomites are nearly stoichiometric, 50. 2 to 53. 2 mole% CaCO 3, whereas, dolomite rhombs have up to 56. 2 mole% CaCO 3. Different types of dolomites can not be distinguished by their isotopic compositions. They range from [...] 6. 1 to [...] 2. 5 ‚Ä∞ PDB delta 18 O, and [...] 6. 0 to + 3. 3 ‚Ä∞ PDB delta 13 C. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios vary from 0. 7081 to 0. 7094. Different types of dolomites appear to be facies related, and are interpreted to have formed during syndepositional and shallow burial possibly by means of reflux of evaporated Late Devonian sea water. This is indicated by (1) dolomites overlain by bedded anhydrites; (2) amount of dolomite decreasing downsection; (3) presence of dolomite clasts in transgressive shales of overlying paracycles; (4) 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios close to those inferred for Late Devonian sea water (0. 7080 [...] 0. 7083); and (5) 2 to 3 ‚Ä∞ higher delta 18 O values than reefal replacement dolomite. Downward reflux of dolomitizing fluids appears to be mainly confined to meter to tens of meter-scale paracycles due largely {{to the presence of}} many anhydrite and shale permeability barriers. Large vertical reflux may have operated along or near shelf margins where several paracycles of porous facies are superimposed and impermeable anhydrites are absent. Two major pore types exist. Intercrystalline porosity occurs in sucrosic replacement dolomites with porosity up to 25 %, and permeability of 1000 md. Vugs/molds are associated with mosaic replacement dolomites with lower porosity (3 [...] 18 %) and permeability (< 100 md) than sucrosic dolomite. Anhydrite cements are the major pore-filling phases. Some anhydrite cements were subjected to later dissolution and rehydration...|$|R
