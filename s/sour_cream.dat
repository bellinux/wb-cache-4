As the holiday is observed in spring (March or April), the preparation of Passover borscht used to {{provide an opportunity to}} use up the beet sour left over from pickled beetroots that had been consumed during winter, remaining potatoes that had been stored throughout the winter and <b>sour</b> <b>cream</b> that was readily available in the new calving season. Cold borscht blended with <b>sour</b> <b>cream</b> is also popular on Shavuot (Feast of Weeks), a holiday customarily associated with dairy foods, observed in late May or early June. Seudah Shlishit, or the third meal of the Shabbat, often includes borscht as well.|$|E

5|$|Primary {{ingredients}} in an old-fashioned doughnut include flour, sugar, eggs, <b>sour</b> <b>cream</b> or buttermilk, and leavening agents such as baking powder or baking soda. Additional ingredients may include milk, butter, vanilla extract and salt. The use of buttermilk or <b>sour</b> <b>cream</b> may impart a rich flavor to the doughnut. It is typically deep-fried, {{and may be}} deep fried at a lower temperature compared to other doughnut styles, having a crunchier texture compared to other cake doughnut styles. Frying at a lower temperature contributes to its rough, cracked texture. Being turned several times while cooking in the oil also contributes to its texture.|$|E

50|$|Butter is {{essentially}} the fat of milk. It is usually made from sweet cream. In the USA, Ireland, the UK and the Nordic countries, salt is usually added to it. Unsalted (sweet) butters are most commonly used {{in the rest of}} Europe. However, it can also be made from acidulated or bacteriologically <b>soured</b> <b>cream.</b> Well into the 19th century butter was still made from cream that had been allowed to stand and <b>sour</b> naturally.

5000|$|Many soft cheeses are {{produced}} without use of rennet, by coagulating milk with acid, such as citric acid or vinegar, or the lactic acid produced by <b>soured</b> milk. <b>Cream</b> cheese, paneer, and rubing are traditionally made this way (see [...] for others).The acidification can also come from bacterial fermentation {{such as in}} cultured milk.|$|R
40|$|The growth, {{location}} {{and distribution of}} bacterial colonies in dairy products are important factors for the ripening and flavor development of cheeses, yogurts and <b>soured</b> <b>creams.</b> Starter, non-starter, spoilage and pathogenic bacteria all become entrapped in the developing casein matrix of dairy foods. In order to visualize these bacterial colonies and the environments surrounding them, microscopy techniques are used. The use of various microscopy methods allow for the rapid detection, enumeration and distribution of starter, non-starter and pathogenic bacteria in dairy foods. Confocal laser scanning microscopy is extensively utilised to identify bacteria location via the use of fluorescent dyes. Further study is needed {{in relation to the}} development of micro- gradients and localized ripening parameters in dairy products due to the location of bacteria at the protein-fat interface. Development in the area of bacterial discrimination using microscopy techniques and fluorescent dyes/tags is needed as the benefits of rapidly identifying spoilage/pathogenic bacteria early in product manufacture would be of huge benefit in relation to both safety and financial concerns...|$|R
5|$|Several {{ingredient}} variations {{exist in}} carrot soup preparations. Some carrot soups are prepared using coconut milk, coconut water, coconut cream, coconut butter or coconut pieces.

Chopped mint leaves are used in some versions. It can be served hot or chilled. Salt and pepper can be used to season the dish, and nutmeg is sometimes used as a seasoning.

5|$|Clam dip is {{typically}} prepared using chopped or minced clams, <b>sour</b> <b>cream</b> or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It {{is used as}} a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture and mouthfeel. Canned, cooked, and frozen or fresh clams may be used, the latter of which can be cooked by steaming or pan cooking. Canned clams can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, the dip may thicken, and the liquid from canned clams can be used to thin the dip. Milk or cream is also sometimes used to thin clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, the flavors of the ingredients intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. Smoked clams are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to the dip. The clams can be smoked in the shell and then minced afterward.|$|E

50|$|Diacetyl arises {{naturally}} as {{a byproduct}} of fermentation. In some fermentative bacteria, it is formed via the thiamine pyrophosphate-mediated condensation of pyruvate and acetyl CoA. <b>Sour</b> (cultured) <b>cream,</b> cultured buttermilk, and cultured butter are produced by inoculating pasteurized cream or milk with a lactic starter culture, churning (agitating) and holding the milk until a desired pH drop (or increase in acidity) is attained. Cultured cream, cultured butter, and cultured buttermilk owe their tart flavour to lactic acid bacteria and their buttery aroma and taste to diacetyl.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to isolate, {{identify}} and analyze the diversity of the predominantlactic acid bacteria (LAB) genera occurring in Ukrainian traditionally prepared dairy products and toassess their potential for industrial application. Fermented milk, <b>soured</b> <b>cream,</b> cottage cheese andbryndza made from raw cow’s, goat’s or sheep’s milk were prepared on traditional way without theaddition of a starter culture. The samples were collected from 9 regions in Ukraine. In total 950 strains of LAB strains were isolated and identified using phenotypic and genotypic methods. Among allisolates, Enterococcus sp. strains represented 60 %, Lactococcus sp. — 27 %, Lactobacillus sp. — 6 %, Leuconostoc sp. — 3. 5 % and Pediococcus sp. — 3 %. The diversity of the isolated LAB strains wascorrelated with the type of product and the source of milk. The milk clotting activity of isolated LABstrains was preliminary tested to assess their potential for industrial application as starter cultures. Most (54 %) of the LAB strains isolated from Ukrainian traditional dairy products showed apotentially good acidifying activity and coagulated milk within 12 h. The milk coagulation rate wasnot strongly dependent on the LAB genus and was strain dependent. The time of milk clotting wascorrelated with product, from which strains were isolated. This is the first systematic study of theLAB diversity in Ukrainian artisanal dairy products, which can be a source of new LAB strains withgood technological and functional propertie...|$|R
