40|$|As DOE {{continues}} to advance new power systems, materials issues are often pivotal {{in determining the}} ultimate efficiency that can be reached in the system. Refractory performance in slagging gasification represents one of these issues. The University of North Dakota (UND) Chemical Engineering Department {{in conjunction with the}} UND Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) have initiated a program to thoroughly examine the combined chemical (reaction and phase change) and physical (erosion) effects experienced by a variety of refractory materials during both normal operation and thermal cycling under <b>slagging</b> <b>coal</b> gasification conditions. The goal of this work is to devise a mechanism of refractory loss under these conditions. The focus of the proposed work is to test the corrosion resistance of commercially available refractories to flowing coal slag, and propose the mechanisms of corrosion for the conditions studied. Corrosion is the degradation of material surfaces or grain boundaries by chemical reactions with melts, liquids, or gases, causing loss of material and consequently a decrease in strength of the structure. In order to develop methods of reducing corrosion, the microstructure that is attacked must be identified along with the mechanism and rates of attack. Once these are identified, methods for reducing corrosion rates can be developed. The work will take advantage of equipment and experimental techniques developed at the EERC under funding from several DOE programs. The controlled-atmospheric dynamic corrodent application furnace (CADCAF) will be utilized to simulate refractory/slag interactions under dynamic conditions that more realistically simulate the environment in a <b>slagging</b> <b>coal</b> gasifier than any of the static tests used previously by refractory manufacturers and researchers.

In the absence of water cooling, the chrome-alumina-magnesia spinels were the most resistant to slag attack but were subject to thermal-shock cracking.

Results indicate that the elastic–plastic adhesive model provides an adequate representation of the non sticky particle–wall collisions. Moreover, the presence of a powder layer on the target favours energy dissipation and accumulation of particles close to the surface. This pattern promotes the establishment of a dense-dispersed phase in the near-wall zone of entrained-flow slagging gasifiers. Increasing the temperature, particles shift from the solid/plastic to the fluid state and the coefficient of restitution drops to vanishingly small values, confirming that deposition is the prevailing phenomenon during the collision of sticky particles on a wall...|$|E
40|$|In pilot entrained-flow <b>slagging</b> <b>coal</b> gasifiers, high {{conversion}} efficiency and low pollutant emission levels have been observed, but the mechanism leading to this behaviour {{is not fully}} understood.

In particular, near-wall phenomena were investigated and mechanistic understanding of particle–wall interaction patterns in entrained-flow gasifiers was pursued using the tool of physical modeling. Montan wax was used to mimic, at atmospheric conditions, particle-wall interactions relevant in entrained-flow gasifiers. As a matter of fact, this wax had rheological/mechanical properties resembling under molten state, those of a typical coal slag and, under solid state, those of char particles. Experiments have been carried out in a lab-scale cold entrained-flow reactor, equipped with a nozzle whence molten wax atomized into a mainstream of air to simulate the near-wall fate of char/ash particles in a real hot environment. The four particle-wall interaction regimes were investigated. The partitioning of the wax droplets/particles into the different phases was characterized by their selective collection at the reactor exhaust. Results showed that the particlewall interaction mechanisms and segregation patterns are deeply affected by the stickiness of both the wall layer and the impinging particle. In particular, the micromechanical interaction of a particle with a sticky wall enhances particle transport to the wall and the tendency to reach a segregationcoverage regime with the formation of a dense-dispersed phase in the near-wall region of the reactor.

40|$|Calcium oxide {{injected}} in a slagging combustor {{reacts with}} the sulfur from coal combustion to form sulfur-bearing particles. The reacted particles impact and melt in the liquid slag layer on the combustor wall by the centrifugal {{force of the}} swirling combustion gases. Due to the low solubility of sulfur in slag, it must be rapidly drained from the combustor to limit sulfur gas re-evolution. Prior analyses and laboratory scale data indicated that for Coal Tech's 20 MMBtu/hour, air-cooled, <b>slagging</b> <b>coal</b> combustor slag mass flow rates in excess of 400 lb/hr should limit sulfur re-evolution. The objective of this 42 -month project was to validate this sulfur-in-slag model {{in a group of}} combustor tests. A total of 36 days of testing on the combustor were completed during the period of performance of this project. This was more that double the 16 test days that were required in the original work statement. The extra tests were made possible by cost saving innovations that were made in the operation of the combustor test facility and in additional investment of Coal Tech resources in the test effort. The original project plan called for two groups of tests. The first group of tests involved the injection of calcium sulfate particles in the form of gypsum or plaster of Paris with the coal into the 20 MMBtu/hour-combustor. The second group of tests consisted of the entire two-step process, in which lime or limestone is co-injected with coal and reacts with the sulfur gas released during combustion to form calcium sulfate particles that impact and dissolve in the slag layer.

40|$|Entrained-flow <b>slagging</b> <b>coal</b> gasifiers display large {{conversion}} efficiencies {{and small}} levels of unconverted carbon at the exhaust. Both features are apparently {{at odds with}} the fairly small “space-time”of the particle-laden gas feeding, as compared with the time scale of heterogeneous gasification of carbon. This apparent inconsistency can be explained by considering that fuel residence times are longer than the “space-time”due to segregation of fuel particles in the near-wall region of the gasifier. Segregation is promoted by swirl flow, by particle–wall interaction as the wall is covered by a molten layer of slag and by the establishment of a dense-dispersed flow of granular solids in the proximity of the wall. This study presents results of granular flow simulations of the interaction of a dense-dispersed parti- cle flow with the confining wall. Simulations consider that both the particles and the wall may be either “sticky”or “non sticky”, based on the prevailing elastic vs plastic behaviour upon collision. The effect of drag forces exerted on particles by swirled gas flow is simulated in a simplified manner. Particle–particle collisions are modelled with a Hertzian approach that includes torque and cohesion. The extent and time scale of segregation of a lump of particles loaded into a cylindrical vessel are assessed. Results clearly indicate the different structure of the layer of particles establishing at the wall surface in the different interaction regimes. Results of simulations are qualitatively compared with results of an experimental campaign performed in a reactor representing a cold flow model of the entrained-flow gasifier, where solid, molten or semi- molten particles have been simulated by atomized wax as surrogate material.

It contains the combustion components of a 1 MWe coal fired power plant, a 17, 500 lb/hour steam boiler, coal storage and feed components, and stack gas cleanup components. The plant s design incorporates improvements resulting from 2000 hours of testing between 1987 and 1993 on a first generation, commercial scale, air cooled combustor of equal thermal rating. Since operations began in early 1996, a total of 51 days of testing have been successfully completed. Major results include durability of the combustor s refractory wall, excellent combustion with high ash concentration in the fuel, removal of 95 % to 100 % of the slag in the combustor, very little ash deposition in the boiler, major reduction of in-plant parasitic power, and simplified power system control {{through the use of}} modular designs of sub-systems and computer control.

The present project 'DEVELOPMENT & TESTING OF INDUSTRIAL SCALE, COAL FIRED COMBUSTION SYSTEM, PHASE 3 ' on DOE Contract DE-AC 22 - 91 PC 91162 was {{a key element in}} achieving this objective. The project consisted of five tasks that were divided into three phases. The first phase, 'Optimization of First Generation 20 MMBtu/hr Air-Cooled <b>Slagging</b> <b>Coal</b> Tech Combustor', consisted of three tasks, which are detailed in Appendix 'A' of this report. They were implemented in 1992 and 1993 at the first generation, 20 MMBtu/hour, combustor-boiler test site in Williamsport, PA. It consisted of substantial combustor modifications and coal-fired tests designed to improve the combustor's wall cooling, slag and ash management, automating of its operation, and correcting severe deficiencies in the coal feeding to the combustor. The need for these changes was indicated during the prior 900 -hour test effort on this combustor that was conducted as part of the DOE Clean Coal Program. A combination of combustor changes, auxiliary equipment changes, sophisticated multi-dimensional combustion analysis, computer controlled automation, and series of single and double day shift tests totaling about 300 hours, either resolved these operational issues or indicated that further corrective changes were needed in the combustor design. The key result from both analyses and tests was that the combustor must be substantially lengthened to maximize combustion efficiency and sharply increase slag retention in the combustor. A measure of the success of these modifications was realized in the third phase of this project, consisting of task 5 entitled: 'Site Demonstration with the Second Generation 20 MMBtu/hr Air-Cooled <b>Slagging</b> <b>Coal</b> Tech Combustor'. The details of the task 5 effort are contained in Appendix 'C'. It was implemented between 1994 and 1998 after the entire 20 MMBtu/hr combustor-boiler facility was relocated to Philadelphia, PA in 1994. A new test facility was designed and installed. A substantially longer combustor was fabricated. Although not in the project plan or cost plan, an entire steam turbine-electric power generating plant was designed and the appropriate new and used equipment for continuous operation was specified. Insufficient funds and the lack of a customer for any electric power that the test facility could have generated prevented the installation of the power generating equipment needed for continuous operation. All other task 5 project measures were met and exceeded. 107 days of testing in task 5, which exceeded the 63 days (about 500 hours) in the test plan, were implemented. Compared to the first generation 20 MMBtu/hr combustor in Williamsport, the 2 nd generation combustor has a much higher combustion efficiency, the retention of slag inside the combustor doubled to about 75 % of the coal ash, and the ash carryover into the boiler, a major problem in the Williamsport combustor was essentially eliminated. In addition, the project goals for coal-fired emissions were exceeded in task 5. SO{sub 2 } was reduced by 80 % to 0. 2 lb/MMBtu in a combination of reagent injection in the combustion and post-combustion zones. NO{sub x} was reduced by 93 % to 0. 07 lb/MMBtu in a combination of staged combustion in the combustor and post-combustion reagent injection. A baghouse was installed that was rated to 0. 03 lb/MMBtu stack particle emissions. The initial particle emission test by EPA Method 5 indicated substantially higher emissions far beyond that indicated by the clear emission plume.

Preliminary characterization of the hydrodynamics of the lean-dispersed phase, of its interaction with the wall, of the build-up of the liquid wall layer has been accomplished with a focus on the “sticky wall–sticky particle” subregime. The particle deposition rate at the wall and the partitioning of wax droplets between the lean-dispersed phase and the wall liquid layer have been assessed under a range of operating conditions. Temperatures of the atomized wax, of the mainstream air and of the reactor wall have been set in a range of values (120 – 155 °C) at which the wax was fluid. Experiments with wax feeding rate of 0. 2 g s− 1 and flow rate of atomizing air in the order of 0. 30 m 3 h− 1 demonstrated that the fractional mass of wax in the dispersed phase decreased from 91 % to 12 % as the reactor length increased from 0. 03 m to 0. 27 m. The velocity of the descending wall liquid layer, whose thickness was in the order of 0. 2 mm, ranged between 3 mm s− 1 and 6 mm s− 1. The effects of the flow rate of atomization air and of the nozzle temperature were limited...|$|E

Alkali-activated cements consist of an alkaline activator and cementing components, such as blast furnace <b>slag,</b> <b>coal</b> fly ash, phosphorus slag, steel slag, metakaolin, etc., or a combination of two or more of them. Properly designed alkali-activated cements can exhibit both higher early and later strengths than conventional portland cement. The main hydration product of alkali-activated cements is calcium silicate hydrate (Csingle bondSsingle bondH) with low Ca/Si ratios or aluminosilicate gel at room temperature; Csingle bondSsingle bondH, tobmorite, xonotlite and/or zeolites under hydrothermal condition, no metastable crystalline compounds such as Ca(OH) 2 and calcium sulphoaluminates exist. Alkali-activated cements also exhibit excellent resistance to corrosive environments. The leachability of contaminants from alkali-activated cement stabilized hazardous and radioactive wastes is lower than that from hardened portland cement stabilized wastes. From all these aspects, it is concluded that alkali-activated cements are better matrix for solidification/stabilization of hazardous and radioactive wastes than Portland cement. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The supply {{risk for}} some {{critical}} rare-earth elements (REEs), which are instrumental in many cleantech applications, has sparked {{the development of}} innovative recycling schemes for End-of-Life fluorescent lamps, permanent magnets and nickel metal hydride batteries. These waste fractions represent relatively small volumes, albeit with relatively high rare-earth contents. Rare earths are also present in lower concentrations in a multitude of industrial process residues, such as phosphogypsum, bauxite residue (red mud), mine tailings, metallurgical <b>slags,</b> <b>coal</b> ash, incinerator ash and waste water streams. This review discusses the possibilities to recover rare earths from these “secondary resources”, which have in common that they contain only low concentrations of rare-earth elements, but are available in very large volumes and could provide significant amounts of rare earths. The success rate is set to increase if the rare-earth recovery from these industrial waste streams {{is part of a}} comprehensive, zero-waste, “product-centric” valorisation scheme, in which applications are found for the residual fractions that are obtained after removal of not only the rare earths but also other valuable (base) metals. status: publishe...|$|R
