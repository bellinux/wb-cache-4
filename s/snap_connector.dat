50|$|The nine-volt battery, or 9-volt battery, in {{its most}} common form was {{introduced}} for the early transistor radios. It has a rectangular prism shape with rounded edges and a polarized <b>snap</b> <b>connector</b> at the top. This type is commonly used in walkie-talkies, clocks and smoke detectors.|$|E
50|$|The battery {{has both}} {{terminals}} in a <b>snap</b> <b>connector</b> on one end. The smaller circular (male) terminal is positive, {{and the larger}} hexagonal or octagonal (female) terminal is the negative contact. The connectors on the battery {{are the same as}} on the connector itself; the smaller one connects to the larger one and vice versa. The same snap-style connector is used on other battery types in the Power Pack (PP) series. Battery polarization is normally obvious since mechanical connection is usually only possible in one configuration. A problem with this style of connector is that it is very easy to connect two batteries together in a short circuit, which quickly discharges both batteries, generating heat and possibly a fire. Because of this hazard, 9-volt batteries should be kept in the original packaging until {{they are going to be}} used. An advantage is that several nine-volt batteries can be connected to each other in series to provide higher voltages.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} {{to the development of}} MOEMS devices by robotic microassembly of individual micro-optical components onto reconfigurable free-space micro-optical table (RFS-MOT). Various micro-optical elements (e. g. microlenses, micromirrors) are integrated within a generic structure of silicon holders. The holders are manipulated by 3 D micro-assembly station with active microgripper, then aligned with nanometer precision within the guiding rails of silicon baseplate, and finally fixed by release of integrated mechanical <b>snap</b> <b>connector.</b> The fabrication of RFS-MOT components involves bulk micromachining of standard silicon wafer (baseplate) or SOI wafer (holders). The design and technology of RFS-MOT is presented. The successful micro-assembly of holders is demonstrated as an experimental validation of the proposed approach. The new method for measuring of position of assembled holder, based on laser triangulation displacement sensor, is described...|$|E
5000|$|The name {{fishtail}} {{comes from}} the fish tail extension at the back that could be folded up between the legs, much like a Knochensack, and fixed using <b>snap</b> <b>connectors</b> to add wind-proofing. The fishtail was fixed at the front for warmth or folded away at the back to improve freedom of movement when needed.|$|R
50|$|The {{military}} type of carrier, English police waistcoat carrier, {{or police}} tactical carrier most typically has {{a series of}} webbing, hook and loop, and <b>snap</b> type <b>connectors</b> {{on the front and}} back face. This permits the wearer to mount various gear to the carrier in many different configurations. This load carriage feature {{is an important part of}} uniform and operational design for police weapons teams and the military.|$|R
50|$|A Snap-fit (Integral Attachment Feature) is an {{assembly}} method used to attach flexible parts, usually plastic, {{to form the}} final product by pushing the parts' interlocking components together. There {{are a number of}} variations in snap fits, including cantilever, torsional and annular. Snap fits are an alternative to assembly using nails or screws, and have the advantages of speed and no loose parts. <b>Snap</b> fit <b>connectors</b> can be found in everyday products such as battery compartment lids, Snap fasteners and Pens.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2005 {{the trains}} were {{returned}} to Vekoma factories after a major breakdown {{in the form of}} a restraint <b>connector</b> <b>snapping</b> occurred. All the restraints were equipped with toughened steel and, presumably in an attempt to increase the smoothness the wheels were also tightened, this was thought to be the reason for a rollback on the first test run (due to the increased friction), however it is said to be a one-off occurrence.|$|R
50|$|The RepRap Snappy is {{designed}} to address to core goal of the RepRap project of creating a general-purpose self-replicating manufacturing machine. The RepRap Snappy is able to create 73% of its own parts by volume with a design that eliminates {{as many of the}} non 3D printed parts as possible including belts and bearings which are replaced with a rack and pinion system. The name Snappy comes from the use of <b>snap</b> fit <b>connectors</b> used on the small printed parts to construct larger pieces, this both cuts down on the use of non 3D printed parts and means a smaller build volume is needed on the machine producing the parts. The only non self replicating parts on the printer are the motors, electronics, a glass build plate and one 686 bearing, the 3D printed parts take around 150 hours to create. The RepRap Snappy received an honourable mention in the Uplift Prize Grand Personal Manufacturing Prize.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} a functional super Read Out Driver (sROD) demonstrator for the Phase II Upgrade of the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter (TileCal) in the LHC experiment. The proposed front-end for the Phase II Upgrade communicates with back-end electronics using a multifiber optical connector with a data rate of 57. 6 Gbps using the GBT protocol. This functional sROD demonstrator aims to help in the understanding of the problems that could arise in the upgrade of back-end electronics. The demonstrator is composed of three different boards that have been developed in the framework of ATLAS activities: the Optical Multiplexer Board (OMB), the Read-Out Driver (ROD) and the Optical Link Card (OLC). The first two boards, OMB and ROD, are part of the current back-end system where OMB receives two optical fibers with redundant data from front-end, performs online CRC for data and send to ROD the data from the error-free fiber; and ROD is the main element of the back-end electronics and it is responsible for data processing. Both boards are a 9 U VME format. Moreover, the last board, OLC, has been developed as an evaluation board for studying high-speed optical links for the R&amp;D of the TileCal Upgrade. It includes two <b>SNAP</b> 12 optical <b>connectors</b> which are able to transmit and receive up to 75 Gbps and an Altera Stratix II GX FPGA as processing device. The scheme of the functional sROD demonstrator includes an OLC plugged in an OMB board where OLC receives data from upgraded front-end via a <b>SNAP</b> 12 <b>connector</b> at 57. 6 Gbps and decodes it using a GBT decoder. OMB reads decoded data from OLC via mezzanine connectors, performs online CRC and sends data to ROD via a SFP connector at 640 Mbps. Once ROD has received data, it performs the Optimal Filtering algorithms. This functional sROD demonstrator will be used to develop a prototype, in ATCA format, of the new ROD for the Phase II...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} an optical link card developed {{in the frame of}} the R&D activities for the phase 2 upgrade of the TileCal experiment. This board, {{that is part of the}} evaluation of different technologies for the final choice in the next years, is designed as a mezzanine that can work independently or be plugged in the optical multiplexer board of the TileCal backend electronics. It includes two <b>SNAP</b> 12 optical <b>connectors</b> able to transmit and receive up to 75 Gb/s and one SFP optical connector for lower speeds and compatibility with existing hardware as the read out driver. All processing is done in a Stratix II GX field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Details are given on the hardware design, including signal and power integrity ana lysis, needed when working with these high data rates and on firmware development to obtain the best performance of the FPGA signal transceivers and for the use of the GBT protocol...|$|R
5000|$|In his new Energon body, Megatron {{transforms}} into {{a heavily}} armed jet-ship that can transform into [...] "hyper mode" [...] by {{pulling on the}} translucent green sections of his wings. He is packaged with a large electronic tank accessory, designed to resemble his original Armada body (except in black), which fires a single missile from its cannon with an electronic blast. A removable sword blade made of clear plastic is stored in Megatrons own nosecone; by inserting the rear end of the tank into the nosecone and pressing the release button, the blade <b>snaps</b> into a <b>connector</b> on the tank and is extracted. Pushing the blade (by striking another toy while playing, for example), yields a metallic clang and a flashing light that illuminates the sword. The tank can mount {{on the back of}} Megatrons jet mode, or can clip to either of his robot mode arms, with either cannon or sword pointed forward.|$|R
5000|$|Most panel {{connectors}} {{are designed}} to be mounted with one end of the cable permanently and internally connected to the panel, with {{the other end of the}} cable equipped with the connector. This allows the panels to be connected together by <b>snapping</b> together adjacent <b>connectors.</b> Solarlok did not work this way, instead it imagined the panels and all other equipment in the system (inverters, combiners, etc.) would be equipped with sockets, while the cables had plug connectors at both ends. This meant that the panels themselves did not have to have cables permanently connected to them, which helped when you want to span a longer distance or solve other problems where a permanent cable might not be long enough. However, this led to the possibility that one could connect the positive output from one panel to the positive of the next (or negative to negative) by confusing the wires. To eliminate this possibility, the sockets and plugs had plastic flanges known as [...] "keys" [...] that indicated their polarity, and prevented a cable from being plugged into a positive at one end and negative at the other.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWashable textile {{compression}} sleeve with removable stimulation and recording electrodes [from 10]. Left panel showing {{inside of the}} sleeve: saline-soaked sponge electrode placed in a suction cup and stainless-steel snap EMG electrodes. Right panel showing outside of the sleeve: bipolar stimulation electrode and EMG <b>snap</b> electrode with <b>connectors</b> and leads. Abstract Functional electrical stimulation (FES) involves electrical stimulation of nerves and muscles with continuous short pulses of electrical current to assist functional movement of the limbs following paralysis. In this study, we explored a low-cost stimulation electrode based on re-usable buffered-saline-soaked sponge. We investigated the effects of electrode profile and conductivity on the current density at depths below {{the center of the}} electrode {{as well as at the}} electrode-skin interface. We found from Finite Element Analysis that lower conductivity as well as concave-top sponge electrode can reduce edge-effects. Furthermore, we found that concave-top sponge electrode in conjunction with lower electrode conductivity can improve current density at shallow depths below the center of the electrode. We performed a preliminary cutaneous sensation test on 10 healthy volunteers to validate our computational results. We found that lowering sponge-conductivity by about 1 / 16 th reduced perceived pain sensation by about 1. 572 ± 0. 244 times, as assessed with a visual analogue scale...|$|R
