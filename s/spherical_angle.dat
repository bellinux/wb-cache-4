The integral of the traction kernel is dened as a boundary limit, and (partial) analytic evaluation is employed {{to compute the}} limit. The <b>spherical</b> <b>angle</b> components of the Green's function and its derivatives are not known in closed form, and thus the analytic integration requires a splitting of the kernel, into `singular ' and `non-singular ' terms.

The proposed system performs the feature transformation that changes the 3 D Cartesian coordinates of each joint into the 2 D <b>spherical</b> <b>angles</b> of the corresponding arm part to obtain view-invariant and more discriminative features.

40|$|Abstract. The {{question}} of how many regular unit tetrahedra with a vertex at the origin can be packed into the unit sphere is a well-known and difficult problem. The answer is between 20 and 22, and these results are reproduced-here. The classical method for calculating such bounds involves projecting the tetrahedra {{onto the surface of}} the sphere, yielding equilateral spherical triangles. Motivated by this, we search for upper and lower bounds on how many equilateral spherical triangles may be arranged on the unit sphere {{as a function of the}} <b>spherical</b> <b>angle</b> α between two sides. For α ≥ 2 pi 5, we describe some possible arrangements of equilateral spherical triangles on the sphere, but the primary focus of this paper is on pi 3 < α ≤ 2 p...|$|E
40|$|Using {{directional}} antennae {{in forming}} a {{wireless sensor network}} has many advantages over omnidirectional, including improved energy efficiency, reduced interference, increased security, and improved routing efficiency. We propose using double (Yagi) directional antennae in 3 D space: for a given <b>spherical</b> <b>angle</b> such antennae transmit from their apex simultaneously directionally along two diametrically opposing cones in 3 D. We study the resulting network formed by such directional sensors. We design a new algorithm to address strong connectivity of the resulting network and compare its hop-stretch factor with the three-dimensional omnidirectional model. We also obtain a lower bound on the minimum range required to ensure strong connectivity for sensors with double antennae. Further, we present simulation results comparing the diameter of a traditional sensor network using omnidirectional and one using directional antennae. © 2013 Springer-Verlag...|$|E

Propulsive maneuvers are accomplished via low-thrust, non-throttleable thrusters using pulse-width modulation and thrust vectoring.

The extra manifold can be pictured as an apple-like surface i. e. a sphere with an extra "wedge" insert. Such a surface has conical singularities at north and south poles. It is shown that for this setup one can obtain, in four dimensions, three trapped massless fermion modes which differ from each other by having different values of angular momentum with respect to the internal 2 -manifold. The extra angular momentum acts as the family label and these three massless modes are interpreted as the three generations of fundamental fermions.
