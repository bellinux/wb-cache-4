5|$|The {{main event}} was the Triple Threat {{match for the}} WWE Championship between {{champion}} John Cena, Edge, and Triple H. As the match began, Edge chose to stand outside the ring, hoping that Cena and Triple H would simply fight the match themselves. Cena and Triple H, however, teamed up and turned against Edge. One spot in the match saw Edge catapult Triple H into the steel ringpost, which made Triple H bleed. Afterwards, Edge executed an Edgecution onto an announce table on Triple H and then focused on Cena. Cena, however, locked Edge in the STFU, but was broken when Triple H hit Cena {{in the head with}} a microphone. Triple H then went after Edge and hit him with a chair, sending him over the <b>security</b> <b>wall</b> and into the audience. Lita, who accompanied Edge, entered the ring with a chair to hit Triple H, but Triple H reversed it into a Spinebuster, a move where the wrestler lifts the opponent, turning 180°, and then tosses her forward onto her back. Near the end of the match, Cena attempted an FU on Edge but Triple H delivered a low blow to Cena, which made Cena drop Edge out of the ring and attempted to execute a Pedigree. Cena, however, countered it into a jackknife roll-up. Cena won the match and successfully retained the WWE Championship. After the match, Triple H hit Cena, Edge, and the referee with a sledgehammer, and performed his signature taunt until performing his signature DX cross chops, receiving a standing ovation from the audience, closing the show.|$|E
25|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Raven (ECW) and William Regal (WWF). Regal gained the early {{advantage}} following a double underhook suplex, and a catapult, sending Raven outside. Back in the ring, Raven tossed Regal over top rope, and performed a baseball slide, and a Russian legsweep into the <b>security</b> <b>wall.</b> Back in the ring, Raven performed a diving punch to Regal's forehead. Regal countered another attempt, and performed a knee lift. Raven fought {{back with a}} corner clothesline, and a running bulldog. Regal fought back, countering a Raven Effect DDT into a Northern Lights suplex. After both collided, Raven rolled out of the ring, as Tazz came down. As the referee checked on Raven, Tazz performed a T-Bone suplex to Regal. Tazz left, and Raven pinned Regal after performing a Raven Effect DDT.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} on the Syrian side {{have been}} conducted {{as part of the}} Land of Carchemish project: investigations of the Outer Town of Carchemish were undertaken in conjunction with the DGAM in Damascus and with the funding and sponsorship of the Council for British Research in the Levant and of the British Academy, {{under the direction of the}} late Professors T. J. Wilkinson and E. Peltenburg. The Outer Town area lying in Syria has been designated an endangered cultural heritage site and labelled “at risk” by the Global Heritage Fund, due to the agricultural expansion and, especially, the urban encroachment. The field assessment of the Syrian part of the Outer Town documented that parts of the modern border town of Jerablus encroached upon the Outer Town. In February 2016, a prefabricated <b>security</b> <b>wall</b> (thus with no foundations that could have damaged the ancient site) has been completed by the Turkish Army to the south of the railway, stretching between the Euphrates bridge and the train station of Karkamış.|$|E

25|$|The next match saw Edge {{defending}} the World Heavyweight Championship against Rey Mysterio. Throughout the match, Edge worked on Mysterio's injured biceps, affecting Mysterio's offense. However, Mysterio retaliated, delivering a Tornado DDT on Edge for an unsuccessful pin attempt. Later in the match, Mysterio executed a 619 on Edge, but couldn't capitalize {{due to his}} biceps. He then attempted a Springboard Splash, but Edge speared Mysterio in mid-air, and pinned him, retaining the title. After the match, The Big Show made a surprise return to WWE, where he cut a promo on his recent weight loss (over 108 pounds) and future plans of becoming a champion again. After doing so, The Big Show began taunting professional boxer Floyd Mayweather, Jr., who was in attendance and Mysterio's close friend. As Big Show threatened to chokeslam Mysterio, Mayweather jumped over the <b>security</b> <b>wall</b> and entered the ring to confront Big Show. Show then got on his knees to allow Mayweather to punch him, which Mayweather did {{with a combination of}} punches, bloodying The Big Show from the nose and mouth. Mayweather and his crew fled the ring, and then through the crowd, where Shane McMahon stopped The Big Show from chasing them.|$|E
500|$|After Heat, the {{pay-per-view}} {{began with}} a tag team match for the World Tag Team Championship, where La Résistance (Sylvain Grenier and Robért Conway) defended the title against Chris Benoit and Edge [...] La Résistance gained the early advantage when Conway grabbed Edge and rammed him onto the <b>security</b> <b>wall,</b> back first. At one point, Benoit applied a crossface submission hold on Grenier. Kane's pyrotechnics went off {{and made his way}} to the ring, as he entered the ring and delivered a Big Boot to Benoit, prompting the referee to end the match in a disqualification, thus La Résistance retained the World Tag Team title.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the Israel Ministry of Transport planned to {{construct}} Highway 45 from Highway 1 near Ben Gurion International Airport through the West Bank passing slightly north of Beit Horon and Beit Ur al-Fauqa to the Atarot Industrial Park in Jerusalem. [...] The current Route 443, {{just south of}} these towns, has put that plan on hold, leaving {{a small portion of}} Highway 45 between Givat Zeev and Atarot completed in 2003. [...] Furthermore, an easterly extension was envisioned which would continue from Atarot and connect with Route 437 and the Eastern Ring Road. [...] Additionally, 45 was eventually supposed to reach the border with Jordan north of the Dead Sea.

Batista performed a spear to JBL through the <b>security</b> <b>wall.</b> JBL shoved Batista into the ringpost {{and continued to}} beat down Batista after a short-arm clothesline. He then whipped and choked Batista with a leather belt. Batista fought back with a belly to back suplex and whipped JBL with the belt. JBL fought back, performing a Clothesline from Hell for a near-fall and bringing the steel steps into the ring. He attempted {{an attack on the}} steps, but Batista countered with a back body drop. He then performed a spinebuster and two Batista Bombs, with the second onto the steel steps, to win the match and retain his title.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{granular}} computing, information {{flows in}} Discretionary Access Control (DAC) are examined. DAC are {{classified in the}} following nested order: From general to specific, binary neighborhood systems(binary relations),topological spaces (reflexive and transitive relations) and clopen spaces (equivalence relations) in geometric (algebraic) terms. In security terms, the two smaller classes meet information flow <b>security</b> and Chinese <b>wall</b> <b>security</b> policy in respective order. Roughly, information flow security policy (IFSP) means any data can never flow or propagate into the enemy hands of the initial owner.

40|$|This project {{establishes}} a Chinese <b>wall</b> <b>security</b> policy {{model in the}} environment of cloud computing. In 1988 Brewer and Nash proposed a very nice commercial security policy in British financial world. Though the policy was well accepted, but the model was incorrect. A decade later, Dr. Lin provided a model in 2003 that meets Brewer 2 ̆ 6 Nash’s Policy. One of the important components in Cloud computing is data center. In order for any company to store data in the center, a trustable security policy model is a must; Chinese <b>wall</b> <b>security</b> policy model will provide this assurance. The heart of the Chinese <b>Wall</b> <b>Security</b> Policy Model {{is the concept of}} Conflict of Interest (COI). The concept can be modeled by an anti-reflexive, symmetric and transitive binary relation.
