5|$|Aluminum {{production}}, shipbuilding, {{and nuclear}} {{production at the}} Hanford site contributed to a rapid increase in regional demand for electricity. By 1943, fully 96 percent of Columbia River electricity was being used for war manufacturing.

5|$|A {{parliamentary}} {{inquiry and}} media reports {{indicated that the}} Indigenous traditional owners of Muckaty Station were divided over whether it should host a radioactive waste facility. Some members of the Ngapa clan supported hosting the facility, while other traditional owners of Muckaty opposed it. There were also claims that {{some members of the}} Ngapa clan were among those who had signed a petition opposing the facility. Political scientist Rebecca Stringer criticised the federal government's approach to the siting of the waste facility, arguing that it undermined the Indigenous owners' sovereignty and control of their own lands. Environmental organisations and the Australian Greens are opposed to using the <b>site</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> dump.|$|E

5|$|Director Harry Morris {{identified}} a <b>site</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new ground in Bordesley Green, some {{three-quarters of a}} mile(1km) from Muntz Street towards the city centre. The site was where a brickworks once operated; the land sloped steeply down to stagnant pools, yet the stadium was constructed in under twelve months from land clearance to opening ceremony on Boxing Day 1906. Heavy snow nearly prevented the opening; volunteers had to clear pitch and terraces before the match, a goalless draw against Middlesbrough, could go ahead. The ground is reputed to have been cursed by gypsies evicted from the site; although gypsies {{are known to have}} camped nearby, there is no contemporary evidence for their eviction by the club.|$|E
5|$|During April 1887, J.I. Berry {{established}} a <b>site</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> town after {{he chose a}} well-watered section along {{the way of the}} Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad, which had begun building across the Texas Panhandle. Berry and Colorado City, Texas, merchants wanted to make their new town site the region's main trading center. On August 30, 1887, Berry's town site won the county seat election and was established in Potter County. Availability of the railroad and freight service after the county seat election made the town a fast-growing cattle-marketing center.|$|E

5|$|From {{the start}} of the 18th century onwards, the garden went through major changes as it fell into neglect. It was painted in 1747 by Canaletto during a period of transition, as Westminster was being {{transformed}} by the construction of new buildings and roads. By {{the start of}} the 19th century it had been redeveloped as the <b>site</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> row of townhouses, some of which were occupied by prime ministers seeking homes near the government buildings nearby. The last remnants of the Privy Garden were destroyed in 1938 during the construction of government offices which now house the Ministry of Defence's headquarters building.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, Mount Stromlo was {{assessed}} {{as a possible}} <b>site</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Commonwealth Solar Observatory, and it became {{the location of the}} facility in 1924. It was operated as a Commonwealth government facility until 1957, when it was transferred to the Australian National University (ANU). From 1944 to 1968 it was also the site of the national time-keeping service. By the early 1980s, Mount Stromlo, together with the ANU's Siding Spring observatory, was producing Australia's greatest astronomical research output.|$|E
5|$|In 1977-78, the West Australian Government, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Charles Court, announced plans for a nuclear power reactor near Perth. 1977 was seen as the year of mass mobilization in WA, with 300 at the first anti-nuclear demonstration to 9,000 at the third protest in the inner city of Perth. Despite public protest, the WA Government selected a first <b>site</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> nuclear reactor in 1979 at Wilbinga, 70 kilometres north of Perth. Court predicted that at least another 20 nuclear power plants would be needed {{by the end of the}} century to meet rapidly growing power demand, but all of this never eventuated.|$|E

A staging area for 60,000troops was also established on the island. Thousands of American troops later passed through Goodenough Island before the base was closed at the end of 1944.|$|E
