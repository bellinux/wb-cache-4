5|$|A {{migraine}} is {{a primary}} headache disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe. Typically, the headaches affect {{one half of the}} head, are pulsating in nature, and last from two to 72 hours. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>light,</b> sound, or smell. The pain is generally made worse by physical activity.|$|E
5|$|While {{studying}} in Germany, Sutcliffe began experiencing severe headaches and acute <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>light.</b> In April 1962, he {{collapsed in the}} middle of an art class after complaining of head pains. German doctors performed various checks, but were unable to determine the exact cause of his headaches. On 10 April 1962, he was taken to the hospital, but died in the ambulance on the way. The cause of death was later revealed to have been an aneurysm in his brain's right hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Narrow/closed angle {{glaucoma}} is an {{autosomal dominant}} inheritable trait in the breed. It {{is a leading}} cause of blindness in dogs, and is where there is increased fluid pressure within the eye. If the fluid is not reduced, the pressure causes permanent damage to the retina and optic nerve. Loss of eyesight can happen as quickly as within 24 hours if the pressure if elevated enough, or slowly over time if it is only a mild elevation. The sudden, rapid elevation of pressure is more common with narrow/closed angle glaucoma which is more common to the breed than the slower open angle glaucoma. Symptoms can include redness in the eye, the eye itself looking cloudy, <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> and the dog may rub at their eye, or even rub it along other objects and carpet as the condition is moderate to extremely painful. Treatment can vary depending on the severity of the condition but if inherited glaucoma appears in one eye then it usually occurs in the other eye eventually.|$|E

5|$|Using a {{standard}} laboratory method to determine antimicrobial susceptibility, methanol-based extracts of Strobilurus tenacellus fruit bodies were {{shown in a}} 2000 study to have low antibacterial activity against the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, and low to moderate activity against the fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The fungus produces the natural antibiotic strobilurinA, which was reported as a novel compound from this species in 1977; other strobilurins have since been found in other basidiomycete wood-rotting fungi, like Porcelain Mushroom for example. StrobilurinA {{is thought to be}} derived biosynthetically from the amino acid L-phenylalanine. In nature, the fungus secretes the chemical to prevent invasion by other fungi that challenge its nutrient source. It works by blocking electron transfer in the mitochondria, stopping respiration by binding to the ubihydroquinone oxidation center of the bc1 complex. This prevents the competing fungus from creating its own energy and inhibiting its growth at the earliest stages of the life cycle, the spore germination stage. The fungus is resistant to its own chemical because its ubihydroquinone has three amino acid residues that prevent the strobilurins from binding. Because of their <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>light,</b> and high vapor pressures that causes them to rapidly disappear when applied to the surface of a leaf, chemically unmodified strobilurins are not generally useful as fungicides for agricultural use. The strobilurin-derived compound azoxystrobin, ﬁrst made commercially available in 1996, was designed to overcome these limitations. It is the world's biggest-selling fungicide. Other commercial fungicides developed from the strobilurins include Allegro, and Brio (kresoxim-methyl) Amistar.|$|E

50|$|Side {{effects are}} similar to those for other β-lactam antibiotics, {{including}} nausea, vomiting, rashes, and antibiotic-associated colitis. Loose bowel movements (diarrhea) may also occur. Rarer side effects include mental changes, lightheadedness, insomnia, confusion, anxiety, <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>lights</b> and sounds, and unclear thinking. Immediate medical care is required upon the first signs of these side effects.|$|R

25|$|Symptoms include severe headache, a {{sustained}} high fever, cough, rash, severe muscle pain, chills, falling blood pressure, stupor, <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>light,</b> delirium and death. A rash begins {{on the chest}} about {{five days after the}} fever appears, and spreads to the trunk and extremities. A symptom common to all forms of typhus is a fever which may reach 39°C (102°F).|$|E
25|$|Further {{research}} into this mechanism {{revealed that the}} photographic properties of silver halides (in particular AgBr) were a result of deviations from an ideal crystal structure. Factors such as crystal growth, impurities, and surface defects all affect concentrations of point ionic defects and electronic traps, which affect the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> and allow {{for the formation of}} a latent image.|$|E
25|$|Silver bromide (AgBr), a soft, pale-yellow, water-insoluble salt {{well known}} (along with other silver halides) for its unusual <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>light.</b> This {{property}} has allowed silver halides {{to become the}} basis of modern photographic materials. AgBr is widely used in photographic films and is believed by some to {{have been used for}} making the Shroud of Turin. The salt can be found naturally as the mineral bromargyrite (bromyrite).|$|E

50|$|Varying the {{wavelengths}} of stimuli also affect the dark adaptation curve. Long wavelengths, such as extreme red, create {{the absence of}} a distinct rod/cone break as the rod and cone cells have similar <b>sensitivities</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> of long wavelengths. Conversely at short wavelengths the rod/cone break is more prominent, because the rod cells are much more sensitive than cones once the rods have dark adapted.|$|R

25|$|About 3 to 6 {{million people}} get {{conjunctivitis}} {{each year in}} the United States. In adults viral causes are more common, while in children bacterial causes are more common. Typically people get better in one or two weeks. If there is visual loss, significant pain, <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>light,</b> signs of herpes, or a person is not improving after a week, further diagnosis and treatment may be required. Conjunctivitis in a newborn, known as neonatal conjunctivitis, may also require specific treatment.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, a far {{different}} version was produced, titled The Omega Man. It starred Charlton Heston (as Robert Neville) and Anthony Zerbe. Matheson had no influence on the screenplay for this film, and although the premise remains, it deviates from the novel in several ways, removing the infected people's vampiric characteristics, except their <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>light.</b> In this version, the infected are portrayed as nocturnal, black-robed, albino mutants, known as The Family. Though intelligent, they eschew modern technology, believing it (and those who use it, such as Neville) to be evil {{and the cause of}} humanity's downfall.|$|E
25|$|Xeroderma pigmentosum mostly {{affects the}} eye and skin. Individuals with XP have extreme <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> in the {{ultraviolet}} range starting from {{one to two years}} of age, and causes sunburn, freckling of skin, dry skin and pigmentation after exposure. When the eye is exposed to sunlight, it becomes irritated and bloodshot, and the cornea becomes cloudy. Around 30% of affected individuals also develop neurological abnormalities, including deafness, poor coordination, decreased intellectual abilities, difficulty swallowing and talking, and seizures; these effects tend to become progressively worse over time. All affected individuals have a 1000-fold higher risk of developing skin cancer: half of the affected population develop skin cancer by age 10, usually at areas most exposed to sunlight (e.g. face, head, or neck). The risk for other cancers such as brain tumors, lung cancer and eye cancers also increase.|$|E

50|$|XPD (Xeroderma pigmentosum factor D, {{also known}} as protein ERCC2) is a 5'-3', Superfamily II, ATP-dependent helicase {{containing}} iron-sulphur cluster domains. Inherited point mutations in XPD helicase {{have been shown to}} be associated with accelerated aging disorders such as Cockayne syndrome (CS) and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). Cockayne syndrome and trichothiodystrophy are both developmental disorders involving <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> UV <b>light</b> and premature aging, and Cockayne syndrome exhibits severe mental retardation from the time of birth. The XPD helicase mutation has also been implicated in xeroderma pigmentosa (XP), a disorder characterized by <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> UV <b>light</b> and resulting in a several 1000-fold increase in the development of skin cancer.|$|R
500|$|... {{sperm whales}} eyes afford good vision and <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>light.</b> They conjectured that sperm whales use vision to hunt squid, either by {{detecting}} silhouettes from below or by detecting bioluminescence.

500|$|John Northrup Shive (February 22, 1913 [...] June 1, 1984) was an American {{physicist}} and inventor. [...] He made notable contributions in electronic engineering and solid-state physics {{during the early}} days of transistor development at Bell Laboratories. [...] In particular, he produced experimental evidence that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium, and not just along the surface as previously thought. This paved the way from Bardeen and Brattain's point contact transistor to Shockley's more-robust junction transistor. Shive is best known for inventing the phototransistor in 1948 (a device that combines the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> of a photodiode and the current gain of a transistor), and for the Shive wave machine in 1959 (an educational apparatus used to illustrate wave motion).|$|E
500|$|Solar {{urticaria}} is an immunoglobulin E-mediated hypersensitivity {{that can}} be introduced through primary or secondary factors, or induced by exogenous photosensitization. Primary SU {{is believed to be}} a type I hypersensitivity (a mild to severe reaction to an antigen including anaphylaxis) in which an antigen, or substance provoking an immune response, is [...] "induced by UV or visible radiation." [...] Secondary SU can occur when a person comes into contact with chemicals such as tar, pitch, and dyes. People who use drugs such as benoxaprofen or patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria may also contract this secondary form. These items that cause this photosensitivity are exogenous photosensitizers because they are outside of the body and cause it to have a greater <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E

50|$|Kruithof's {{findings}} {{are directly related}} to human adaptation to changes in illumination. As illuminance decreases, human <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> blue <b>light</b> increases. This is known as the Purkinje effect. The human visual system switches from photopic (cone-dominated) vision to scotopic (rod-dominated) vision when luminance levels decrease. Rods have a very high spectral <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> blue energy, whereas cones have varying spectral <b>sensitivities</b> <b>to</b> reds, greens and blues. Since the dominating photoreceptor in scotopic vision is most sensitive <b>to</b> blue, human <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> blue <b>light</b> is therefore increased. Because of this, intense sources of higher (bluer) color temperatures are all generally considered to be displeasing at low luminance levels, and a narrow range of pleasing sources exist. Subsequently, the range of pleasing sources increases in photopic vision as luminance levels are increased.|$|R
50|$|Overexpression of Cry {{also affects}} {{circadian}} light responses. In Drosophila, Cry overexpression increases flies' <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> low-intensity <b>light.</b> This light regulation of CRY protein levels suggests that CRY has a circadian role upstream of other clock genes and components.|$|R
500|$|While in Germany, Sutcliffe began {{experiencing}} severe {{headaches and}} acute <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>light,</b> and Kirchherr stated {{that some of}} the headaches left him temporarily blind. In 1962, Sutcliffe collapsed {{in the middle of an}} art class in Hamburg. Kirchherr's mother had German doctors perform various checks on him, but they were unable to determine exactly what was causing the headaches. They suggested he go back to Britain and have himself checked into a hospital with better facilities, but Sutcliffe was told there was nothing wrong with him, so he returned to Hamburg. While living at the Kirchherrs' house his condition got worse, and after collapsing again on 10 April 1962, he was taken to hospital by Kirchherr (who rode with him in the ambulance), but he died before the ambulance reached the hospital. The cause of death was revealed to have been a cerebral haemorrhage, specifically, a ruptured aneurysm resulting in [...] "cerebral paralysis due to bleeding into the right ventricle of the brain." ...|$|E
2500|$|About 10% {{of people}} with PCS develop <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> or noise, about 5% {{experience}} a decreased sense of taste or smell, and about 14% report blurred vision.

2500|$|While {{most people}} know that light is {{important}} for photosynthesis in plants, few realize that plant <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> <b>light</b> {{plays a role in}} the control of plant structural development (morphogenesis).
