60|$|Then {{he stopped}} suddenly; for he {{realized}} that the other was not following. Evan MacIan was leaning on his sword with a lowering face, like a man suddenly <b>smitten</b> still <b>with</b> doubt.|$|R

60|$|Hortensius put out {{his hands}} with a last instinctive sense of self-preservation. The mighty voice rang in his ear, it reverberated through the hot noonday air, and clanged against the copper gates as if a {{powerful}} arm had <b>smitten</b> them <b>with</b> the axe of Jove.|$|R
60|$|The spruce wood {{in which}} he {{presently}} found himself was <b>smitten</b> through <b>with</b> arrows of ruby light from the setting sun.

5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house {{because he could not}} see the washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently <b>smitten</b> <b>with</b> her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E
5|$|Morris also {{continued}} writing poetry and began designing illuminated manuscripts and embroidered hangings. In March 1857, Bell and Dandy {{published a book}} of Morris's poems, The Defence of Guenevere, which was largely self-funded by the author. It did not sell well and garnered few reviews, {{most of which were}} unsympathetic. Disconcerted, Morris would not publish again for a further eight years. In October 1857 Morris met Jane Burden, a woman from a poor working-class background, at a theatre performance and asked her to model for him. <b>Smitten</b> <b>with</b> her, he entered into a relationship with her and they were engaged in spring 1858; Burden would later admit however that she never loved Morris. They were married in a low-key ceremony held at St Michael at the North Gate church in Oxford on 26 April 1859, before honeymooning in Bruges, Belgium, and settling temporarily at 41 Great Ormond Street, London.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Vives {{waking up and}} seeing two women in the bed with him. He remembers being seduced by them when he was drunk the night before. Realizing this, he packs his {{belongings}} and leaves the house. He is seen driving a car until it runs out fuel which forces him to travel by foot where he eventually arrives at a town. In another house, a woman (played by Fabián) wakes up recalling the events of her abusive husband (played by Zamora). She enters a church and says a prayer. Later, Vives is seen hanging out with two men at an outdoor bar when he spots the woman whom he immediately becomes <b>smitten</b> <b>with.</b> Afterwards, he {{and the two men}} are fishing on a boat when Vives sees the woman again. He begins having illusions of him and the woman having a happy life together which drives him insane in his room. That night, the woman finds her husband making love to another woman in a car. Upon discovering this, she leaves the house. At the same time, the town is holding a festival where Vives is celebrating with the townsfolk. The video concludes with him and the woman seeing each other once more and they decide to go out together.|$|E

60|$|The wind raged all {{the next}} day; but spent {{itself in the}} {{following}} night, and the second morning was calm and fair. The eastern sky was a great arc of crystal, <b>smitten</b> through <b>with</b> auroral crimsonings. Thyra, looking from her kitchen window, saw {{a group of men}} on the bridge. They were talking to Carl White, with looks and gestures directed towards the Carewe house.|$|R
60|$|The {{events which}} {{followed}} the massacre in the Bulgarian village remain in my mind, and ever must remain as a confused dream, for I was <b>smitten</b> that night <b>with</b> a fever, {{during the course}} of which--part of it at least--I was either delirious or utterly prostrate.|$|R
5|$|In 1990, eight-year-old Victoria becomes {{upset that}} her mother Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) has married Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), even after he saves her from {{drowning}} in a swimming pool.

60|$|She is {{like some}} tender tree, the pride {{and beauty of}} the grove; graceful in its form, bright in its foliage, but with the worm preying at its heart. We find it {{suddenly}} withering, when it should be most fresh and luxuriant. We see it drooping its branches to the earth, and shedding leaf by leaf, until, wasted and perished away, it falls even in {{the stillness of the}} forest; and as we muse over the beautiful ruin, we strive in vain to recollect the blast or thunderbolt that could have <b>smitten</b> it <b>with</b> decay.|$|R
25|$|By 1925, {{the average}} price for an American car was $870, a huge drop which spelled {{impending}} doom for many car makers. Franklin failed largely because they produced higher-priced, hand-crafted, quality, low-volume automobiles when the public was <b>smitten</b> <b>with</b> low- to moderately priced, mass-produced automobiles.|$|E
25|$|While the POWs were in Florida, the {{government}} relocated hundreds {{of their children}} from their Arizona reservation to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania.

25|$|Some, like William Bast and Paul Alexander, {{believe the}} {{relationship}} was a mere publicity stunt.

60|$|When Uncle Alec {{had gone}} I {{proposed}} a saunter to the farther {{end of the}} orchard, where I had left a book the preceding evening. A young mom was walking rosily on the hills as we passed down Uncle Stephen's Walk, with Paddy trotting before us. High overhead was the spirit-like blue of paling skies; the east was a great arc of crystal, <b>smitten</b> through <b>with</b> auroral crimsonings; just above it was one milk-white star of morning, like a pearl on a silver sea. A light wind of dawn was weaving an orient spell.|$|R
60|$|And Dirkovitch, bland, supple, {{and always}} genial, went away too by a night train. Little Mildred {{and another man}} saw him off, for he was the guest of the mess, and even had he <b>smitten</b> the colonel <b>with</b> the open hand, the law of that mess allowed no {{relaxation}} of hospitality.|$|R
60|$|The Seneschal {{shrugged his}} shoulders, and moved a step towards her. He was cast down {{to think that}} he might have spared himself the trouble of donning his {{beautiful}} yellow doublet from Paris. She had eyes for no finery that afternoon. He was cast down, too, to think how things might go with him when this trouble came. It entered his thoughts that he had lain long on a bed of roses in this pleasant corner of Dauphiny, and he was <b>smitten</b> now <b>with</b> fear lest of the roses he should find nothing remaining but the thorns.|$|R
25|$|Matthew and {{his sister}} Marilla had {{requested}} a boy {{to help them with}} the farm chores. He decides that he couldn’t very well just leave the girl at the train station.

25|$|Viscera began wrestling in {{pajamas and}} making overtly sexual {{gestures}} in the ring.

25|$|It {{was during}} this time he met the Countess Vera Rossakoff, a glamorous jewel thief. The history of the Countess is, like Poirot's, steeped in mystery. She claims {{to have been a}} member of the Russian {{aristocracy}} before the Russian Rebellion and suffered greatly as a result, but how much of that story is true is an open question. Even Poirot acknowledges that Rossakoff offered wildly varying accounts of her early life. Poirot later became <b>smitten</b> <b>with</b> the woman and allowed her to escape justice.|$|E
60|$|Ned Sinton leaped off {{his horse}} as he spoke, and, {{fastening}} {{him to a}} tree, loosened the saddle-girths, and set about preparing the encampment. Tom Collins assisted him; but neither the rallying of his comrade, nor his own efforts could enable the latter {{to shake off the}} depression of spirits, with which he was overpowered. That night the rain came down in torrents, and drenched the travellers to the skin, despite their most ingenious contrivances to keep it out. They spent the night in misery, and when morning broke Ned found that his companion was <b>smitten</b> down <b>with</b> ague.|$|R

6000|$|It was a {{critical}} moment. The captain felt uncertain whether the natives would close round them in force or not. It is always dangerous to fire a shot at savages. But the Boupari men were too utterly awed to venture on defence. [...] "He was Tu-Kila-Kila's enemy," [...] they cried, in astonished tones. [...] "He raised his voice against the very high god. Therefore, the very high god's friends have <b>smitten</b> him <b>with</b> their lightning. Their thunderbolt went through him, and hit the water beyond. How strong is their hand!
