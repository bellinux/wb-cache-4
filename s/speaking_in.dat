5|$|Among the Fundamental Truths was a {{statement}} regarding <b>speaking</b> <b>in</b> tongues as the initial physical evidence of Spirit baptism. Its inclusion was challenged by F.F. Bosworth, an executive presbyter, who argued that while for many <b>speaking</b> <b>in</b> tongues was an evidence of the baptism {{it was not the}} only evidence. The issue was decided at the General Council of September 1918 where Bosworth, who two months earlier had resigned so as not to damage the fellowship, was present and invited to address the council. Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of the fellowship.|$|E

40|$|The term CENTRAL CORDILLERAN (CC) is here {{applied to}} a group of {{languages}} <b>spoken</b> mostly <b>in</b> the mountains of Northern Luzon, Philippines. These languages are Kalinga (<b>spoken</b> <b>in</b> the province of Kalinga Apayao), Itneg (<b>spoken</b> <b>in</b> Abra), Bontok (<b>spoken</b> <b>in</b> Mountain Province), Kankanay (<b>spoken</b> <b>in</b> the west of Mountain Province and <b>in</b> Benguet), Balangaw (<b>spoken</b> <b>in</b> the east of Mountain Province), and Ifugao <b>spoken</b> <b>in</b> the province of the same name).

He stated instead that the car had been rammed by another vehicle with Cuban government license plates, causing the fatal crash.|$|E
5|$|Gaston B. Cashwell, a {{minister}} of the Methodist Church, joined Crumpler's group in 1903. He became a leading figure {{in the church and}} the Pentecostal movement on the east coast.

While there he professed having received the baptism in the Holy Spirit and the evidence of <b>speaking</b> <b>in</b> tongues. Upon returning to Dunn, North Carolina, in December 1906, Cashwell preached the Pentecost experience in the local holiness church.|$|E

5|$|In {{classical}} Pentecostalism, the baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{is understood to}} be a separate and distinct experience occurring sometime after regeneration. It is an empowering experience, equipping Spirit-filled believers for witness and ministry. Extending from this {{is the belief that}} all the spiritual gifts mentioned in the New Testament are to be sought and exercised to build up the church. Pentecostals believe that Spirit baptism will be accompanied by the physical evidence of <b>speaking</b> <b>in</b> tongues (glossolalia).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, R.C. Horner, a Canadian holiness evangelist, {{introduced}} a theological distinction {{that would be}} important {{for the development of}} Pentecostalism. He argued in his books Pentecost (1891) and Bible Doctrines (1909) that the baptism in the Holy Spirit was not synonymous with the second blessing but was actually a third work of grace subsequent to salvation and sanctification that empowered the believer for service. Charles Fox Parham would build on this doctrinal foundation when he identified <b>speaking</b> <b>in</b> tongues as the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism.|$|E
5|$|Lefante {{is found}} {{wandering}} on a roadside, but {{appears to have}} been given an improperly-performed lobotomy. Another woman, Alice Brandt, is later kidnapped.

5|$|Republicans {{lost the}} {{governorship}} that fall, and in 1856 the Democrats {{combined with the}} remaining Whigs {{in the state legislature}} to repeal the Maine law entirely. Some of the other states that had passed Maine laws followed suit as they learned that the promised benefits were not forthcoming and enforcement was difficult, if not impossible. Dow continued to travel the country (and the United Kingdom) <b>speaking</b> <b>in</b> support of prohibition, but to little legislative effect. Maine passed a new, much milder Maine law in 1858, which Dow disliked but defended as better than nothing.|$|E
