"Mrs. Meredith didn't {{know what}} to say to the poor child. <b>She</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not tell him that perhaps his {{sacrifice}} wouldn't bring Jem back--that God didn't work that way. She told him that he mustn't expect it right away--that perhaps it would be quite a long time yet before Jem came back.|$|E
40|$|White Sales! White Sales! Buy {{during the}} white sales and economize- fairly shout the {{newspaper}} advertisements. White sales are an annual affair for department stores. It {{is the time}} of the year when these stores are closing out their odds and ends in preparation for the new supply. The style in linens does not change from year to year so if you buy during sales it does not mean you are getting out of date things. It is truly a place of real bargains. But would it be economy for you if you attended one of these white sales? Miss Smith spied the prettiest piece of yellow satin just a remnant it was, but so cheap <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not resist buying it. She took it home, proud of her bargain, and laid ·it carefully away on the closet shelf, where it still reposes after two years. Perhaps there is not so much danger in buying unusable remnants in household linens, but there are other mistakes we must avoid. So before you venture into the chaos and confusion of the January White Sales be sure to fortify yourself with the following protectors...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> {{discern the}} outline of a little house, not unlike a bathing-machine without wheels.|$|R
60|$|Ethelberta {{turned and}} looked up. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> discern Neigh's form upon {{the steps of the}} fleche above, {{ascending}} toilsomely in search of her.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> discern {{his action}} as he shrugged his shoulders, {{and spread out}} his palms in silence. That cold dislike which is the anger of unimpassioned beings was {{hardening}} within him.|$|R
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> {{take hold}} of a part and do {{something}} with it... I think she never met a part she didn't like. <b>She</b> <b>just</b> loved to work; she loved to act. She's {{a woman who was}} born to do what she was doing and loved every minute of it.|$|R
60|$|Wilhelmina {{leaned back}} in her chair as the last trick fell. Her eyes were turned towards the window. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> see the avenue of elms down which her agent had ridden a short while since. Deyes, through half closed eyes, watched her with some curiosity.|$|R
6000|$|And by {{a glimmer}} of moonlight, through {{curtains}} designed to keep out nothing, she stole up to the bed. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> see his face, and eyes {{looking up at her}} with a sort of adoration. She put her hand on his forehead and whispered: [...] "Are you comfy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And Gyp sat {{looking up}} at the {{apparition}} of her husband. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> see his eyes straining after that flying nymph. Miss Daphne's faun! Why, even his ears were pointed! Had she never noticed before, how like a faun he was? Yes--on her wedding-night! And she said quietly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hollo! {{what did}} you put out the light for?' he angrily answered; and as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> {{distinguish}} his white shirt sleeves, she sprang to him. Steps went hurriedly down the stairs. 'Gone!' they both cried at once; Mervyn, with an imprecation on the darkness, adding, 'Go and ring the bell. I'll watch here.' ...|$|R
50|$|Mary-Claire can be blunt, {{lazy and}} insensitive. Diplomacy is {{definitely}} not her strong point, but scratch at the surface and you’ll find a lonely girl, with a heart of gold, who is desperate to find ‘the one’. She could be a brilliant nurse, if only <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> keep her mind {{on the job and}} learn to believe in herself.|$|R
60|$|It was {{at first}} quite dark in the cabin, but as the visitor’s eyes became {{accustomed}} to it, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> discern the outlines of a small table, while a steady breathing assured her that somebody was sleeping close by. Feeling {{her way to the}} table she discovered, a locker, and, taking a seat, coughed gently. The breathing continuing quite undisturbed, she coughed again, twice.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did. I {{began to}} figure then {{that this was}} a mother lion, and that her cubs were close by, and that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> as well sneak up and drop on me from above as not. So I got down and left her alone. It was her popping up now here and now there like a ghost that locoed me. I was sure scared." ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{some months}} longer, Mr. Gracedieu lingered. One morning, {{he said to}} Eunice: [...] "I want to teach you to knit. Sit by me, and see me do it." [...] His hands fell softly on his lap; his head sank little by little on her shoulder. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> hear him whisper: [...] "How {{pleasant}} it is to sleep!" [...] Never was Death's dreadful work more gently done.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're quite welcome. Laws, {{but your}} eyes is like your ma's. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> about talk with hers. Your father was sorter homely but awful nice. I mind hearing folks {{say when they}} was married that there never was two people more in love with each other--Pore creatures, they didn't live much longer; but they was awful happy while they was alive, and I s'pose that counts for a good deal." ...|$|R
60|$|For a {{few minutes}} longer she {{remained}} standing beside the open window, listening to his footfall on the flagged path. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> distinguish his moving form from the surrounding gloom, as he crept along the shadows towards the boundary of the garden. Then as for one brief minute she saw his figure outlined above the garden wall, she closed the window very slowly and turned away from it.|$|R
6000|$|Her nerves were hurting her. She looked {{automatically}} {{again at}} the high, uncurtained windows. In the last dusk <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> perceive outside a huge fir-tree swaying its boughs: {{it was as if}} she thought it rather than saw it. The rain came flying on the window panes. Ah, why had she no peace? These two men, why did they tear at her? Why did they not come--why was there this suspense? ...|$|R
60|$|The {{schooner}} at once bore up, discharging {{the guns}} on the starboard side as she came round, and laying her course {{as close to the}} wind as she could be jammed, showed her stern to the pirate. Two of his guns forward were fired, others could not be brought to bear. The Arrow was now almost retracing her course, for the wind was west-nor'-west, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> follow the line of coast.|$|R
50|$|Johnnie {{believed}} {{she had to}} tell many lies in her short corrupt life to keep everything she had the way she wanted it. Even though most of her lies soon backfired on her, and made her life worse. Johnnie knew <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> tell the truth but realized over time that lying was much easier.The book contrasts the thin line between lies and the truth, and that taking the easy way isn't always {{the best thing to}} do.|$|R
60|$|Taking a {{sprig of}} {{jessamine}} and holding {{it to her}} nose, she went up to that picture. In the dim light, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> see {{the outline of the}} face and the eyes gazing at her. The scent of the blossom penetrated her nerves; in her heart, something faintly stirred, as a leaf turns over, as a wing flutters. And, blossom and all, she clasped her hands over her breast, where again her heart quivered with that faint, shy tremor.|$|R
50|$|Meghan Beans - High School Junior. Pretty, {{but a bit}} of a live wire. She’s greatly misunderstood; doesn’t {{know why}} people are {{propagating}} rumors about her behavior. Really wishes the group could do more dancing and would have flashier costumes. She’s always wanted a solo. Jesus {{is the only one who}} understands her. But maybe Jasper would too, if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> get to know him better. Totally a belter - to her, singing is less about the right pitch, and more about how you express yourself.|$|R
5000|$|Bauer's first book, Squashed, was set {{in rural}} Iowa. The novel {{features}} a sixteen-year-old named Ellie Morgan, whose life [...] "would be almost perfect if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> get her potentially prize-winning pumpkin to put on about 200 more pounds—and if she could take off 20 herself ... in hopes of attracting Wes, the new boy in town." [...] The novel was published in 1992 by Delacorte Press, a Dell Publishing imprint. According to Delacorte, Squashed won its annual Prize for an Outstanding First Young Adult Novel.|$|R
50|$|There is {{debate as}} to whether Penelope is aware that Odysseus is behind the disguise. Penelope and the suitors know that Odysseus (were he in fact present) would easily surpass all in any test of {{masculine}} skill, so she may have intentionally started the contest {{as an opportunity for}} him to reveal his identity. On the other hand, because Odysseus seems to be the only person (perhaps excepting Telemachus) who can actually use the bow, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> be further delaying her marriage to one of the suitors.|$|R
40|$|Linda Burnham draws out the {{underlying}} messages {{we need to}} learn from Durban and from the US response to September 11 th. While asking us to keep our hopes and our dreams for change, steady souls and spirits, she also asks us to pause at the history of racism and colonialism that is still informing our world. And turning to September 11 th, <b>she</b> asks <b>just</b> how it was possible that it took only two weeks of the Twin Towers tragedy for the US airline industry to squeeze US$ 15 billion out of the federal budget. Tellingly, <b>she</b> asks <b>just</b> what <b>could</b> have been done with that US$ 15 billion towards solving the disease, poverty and insecurity of the world's poor.

500|$|It {{is worth}} pondering what {{the title of}} Mariah Carey's {{eleventh}} studio album could refer to. Emancipation, maybe, in a nod to her 2005 comeback album, The Emancipation of Mimi; or perhaps {{the energy of the}} original equation, a statement that Carey still has what it takes to party all night at the age of 37, even as she describes herself as [...] "eternally 12". Then again, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> be identifying herself alongside Einstein as a fellow genius. Either way, 'E=MC²' finds Carey loopier than ever, embracing her own larger-than-life image with gusto: Mariah Carey Squared indeed.|$|R
5000|$|Another case {{regarding}} marriage arrangements {{concerned a}} virgin who, as an adult, was kidnapped by {{her brother and}} married off to an [...] "unsuitable man". In response, Ramli expressed that the father {{had the right to}} separate the marriage due to the unsuitability of the husband, even if the marriage was consummated. The conditions being, however, that the woman was not pregnant or had given birth to children, had received the dower. However, if the woman was married off without consenting to it, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> choose to divorce her husband without her father's intercession, since her brother was not a proxy.|$|R
5000|$|Rosenberg notes: Yes, it’s {{slightly}} ridiculous ... that Han {{tries to}} pry a confession of affection {{out of her}} on Hoth, as Leia is trying to manage an evacuation with just an ion cannon for defense. But Han’s not wrong that if Leia doesn't figure out that she’s a person with needs, she's going to burn out ... In a way, it’s an early confession of love: Han’s anxious about the bounty hunters who are still pursuing him ... But he would stay and give his love and support to Leia if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> acknowledge that <b>she</b> needs him.|$|R
5000|$|When Palmiotti, Grey and Conner {{left the}} series after issue #12, Palmiotti said, [...] "Amanda always said <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> {{commit to the}} book for a year, and as {{we got into the}} series we {{realized}} that we just couldn't do the same type of book with another artist at this point and decided {{it was a good idea}} to leave with her and give another team a shot." [...] Judd Winick took over as writer with artist Sami Basri beginning with issue #13. Winick stated that the tone of the book will continue, and the premise of the character in New York.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> see {{his face}} in the glimmer that {{filtered}} from the skylight at the top. And she felt that he was learning her, learning all that she had to give him, learning the trust that was shining through her eyes. There was just enough light for them to realize the old house watching from below and from above--a glint on the dark floor there, on the dark wall here; a blackness that seemed to be inhabited by some spirit, so that their hands clutched and twitched, when the tiny, tiny noises of Time, playing in wood and stone, clicked out.|$|R
60|$|Desgas {{was about}} to go, but Chauvelin once more called him back. Marguerite vaguely {{wondered}} what further devilish plans he could have formed, in order to entrap one brave man, alone, against two-score of others. She {{looked at him as}} he turned to speak to Desgas; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> see his face beneath the broad-brimmed, CURES'S hat. There was at that moment so much deadly hatred, such fiendish malice in the thin face and pale, small eyes, that Marguerite's last hope died in her heart, for she felt that from this man she could expect no mercy.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Kendal {{said not}} a word, and Albinia, {{leaning on his}} arm, listened, as it were, to the stillness, or rather to the sounds that marked it--the gurgling of the little streams let off into the water-courses in the meadows; the {{occasional}} plunge of the rat from the banks, the sounds from the town, softened by distance, and the far-off cawings of the rooks, which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> see wheeling about as little black specks over the plantations of Woodside, or watching the swallows assembling for departure sitting in long ranks, like an ornament along {{the roof of a}} neighbouring barn.|$|R
60|$|There were {{stars in}} the heavens, but the night was dark, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> discern an {{outlying}} birch bluff, a shadowy blur against the sky, a mile in front of her. The prairie was rutted deep along the trail by waggon-wheels, and riddled here and there with deadly badger-holes, but these were hazards that must be taken as they came. One thing was sure--the man she had married was in imminent peril, and she alone could deliver him. The fact that Urmston was {{left behind in the}} outlaws' hands did not seem to trouble her. Indeed, she scarcely remembered him at all.|$|R
5000|$|Arrow later {{convinced}} Spider-Man {{to stay at}} the school. However, when Peter {{became a}} fugitive for going against Iron Man, he had to use an image distorter to disguise himself as [...] "Ben Reilly" [...] to continue his career at the school. Later, Arrow showed more hints that she was not as innocent as she looked; in one scene, she ate a spider behind Flash's back. In another, she acted threatened when Betty Brant flirted with Flash; first she unsheathed her stingers before retracting them and holding out her hand and cryptically stating that Betty [...] "looked so good <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> eat her up." ...|$|R
60|$|Putting {{her apron}} {{over her head}} and her arms, she hurried again to the side garden, to the window of the kitchen. Leaning on the sill, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> see, under the blind, her husband's arms spread out on the table, and his black head on the board. He was {{sleeping}} with his face lying on the table. Something in his attitude made her feel tired of things. The lamp was burning smokily; she could tell by the copper colour of the light. She tapped at the window more and more noisily. Almost {{it seemed as if the}} glass would break. Still he did not wake up.|$|R
60|$|The girl {{fell silent}} again, her mind filled with larger conceptions of life than her {{judgment}} had hitherto been {{called upon to}} meet. She knew that Redfield was right, and yet that world of the past--the world of the swift herdsman and his trampling, long-horned, half-wild kine still appealed to her imagination. The West of her girlhood seemed heroic in memory; even the quiet account of it to which <b>she</b> had <b>just</b> listened <b>could</b> not conceal its epic largeness of movement. The part which troubled her most was her father's treachery to his neighbors. That he should fight, that he should kill men in honorable warfare, she could understand; but not his recreancy, his desertion {{of her mother and}} herself.|$|R
5000|$|Lord Mandelson {{responded that}} [...] "Whilst I'm {{prepared}} to take my {{fair share of the}} green revolution on to my shoulders, I'm less keen on having it on my face", and John Prescott said that [...] "What is totally unacceptable is the way the woman walked away claiming it was her right in democracy. She should have been arrested. It is not acceptable that she should be allowed to walk away after an assault." [...] Lord Mandelson noted that [...] "I was slightly surprised that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> saunter off without being apprehended". Deen was arrested on 8 March over the incident, and was cautioned on 9 April for causing [...] "harassment, alarm or distress".|$|R
