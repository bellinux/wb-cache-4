5|$|A second {{option is}} to {{increase}} the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the <b>standpoint</b> <b>of</b> cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E

He consequently protected their interests throughout his reign; for example, he passed a law binding serfs to lands owned by aristocrats.

5|$|Adding to Sulley's lifelike {{appearance}} was an intense {{effort by the}} technical team to refine the rendering of fur. Other production houses had tackled realistic fur, most notably Rhythm & Hues in its 1993 polar bear commercials for Coca-Cola and in its talking animals' faces in the 1995 film Babe. This film, however, required fur on a far larger scale. From the <b>standpoint</b> <b>of</b> Pixar's engineers, the quest for fur posed several significant challenges; one was {{to figure out how}} to animate a large numbers of hairs — 2,320,413 of them on Sulley — in a reasonably efficient way, and another was to make sure that the hairs would cast shadows on other ones. Without self-shadowing, either fur or hair takes on an unrealistic flat-colored look (e.g., in Toy Story, the hair on Andy's toddler sister, as seen in that movie's opening sequence, is hair without self-shadowing).|$|E
5|$|Prose {{works in}} Sanskrit was {{prolific}} during this era as well. Important mathematical theories and axioms were postulated by Mahaviracharya, {{a native of}} Gulbarga, who belonged to the Karnataka mathematical tradition and was patronised by King Amoghavarsha I.

He was the author of Yasastilaka champu, Nitivakyamrita and other writings. The main aim of the champu writing was to propagate Jain tenets and ethics.

5|$|The Battle of Hampton Roads, often {{referred}} to as either the Battle of the Monitor and Merrimack (or Virginia) or the Battle of Ironclads, was the most noted and arguably most important naval battle of the American Civil War from the <b>standpoint</b> <b>of</b> the development of navies. It was fought over two days, March 8–9, 1862, in Hampton Roads, a roadstead in Virginia where the Elizabeth and Nansemond rivers meet the James River just before it enters Chesapeake Bay adjacent to the city of Norfolk. The battle {{was a part of the}} effort of the Confederacy to break the Union blockade, which had cut off Virginia's largest cities, Norfolk and Richmond, from international trade.|$|E
5|$|The Derwent Valley is {{considered}} {{the birthplace of the}} factory system. The machines developed in the Derwent Valley such as the water frame allowed continuous production. Richard Arkwright's Cromford Mill and the associated workers' settlement provided a template for industrial communities, not just in the valley but internationally. The reason a settlement was built contemporaneously with Cromford Mill was to provide housing for the workers; the only way to secure the labour the mill required was if homes were provided for the labourers and their families. The success of Arkwright's model lead to other industrialists copying him. Entrepreneurs such as Peter Nightingale, Jedediah Strutt and Thomas Evans founded the settlements of Belper, Milford, and Darley Abbey within the Derwent Valley for their employees. As well as the economic <b>standpoint</b> <b>of</b> ensuring a supply of labour, the industrialists were also concerned for their employees and families and acted {{out of a sense of}} paternalism.|$|E
5|$|Though Mauritius had {{previously}} been visited by Arab vessels in the Middle Ages and Portuguese ships between 1507 and 1513, they did not settle on the island. The Dutch Empire acquired the island in 1598, renaming it after Maurice of Nassau, and it was used from then on for the provisioning of trade vessels of the Dutch East India Company. To the Dutch sailors who visited Mauritius from 1598 and onwards, the fauna was mainly interesting from a culinary <b>standpoint.</b> <b>Of</b> the eight or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet (Psittacula echo) of Mauritius has survived.

5|$|To {{the sailors}} {{who visited the}} Mascarene islands from 1598 onwards, the fauna was mainly {{interesting}} from a culinary <b>standpoint.</b> <b>Of</b> the eight or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet has survived. The others likely all vanished due {{to a combination of}} extensive hunting and deforestation. Due to being easily caught, the Mascarene grey parakeet was often hunted in abundance by early visitors to Mauritius and Réunion. As they fattened themselves from June to September, they were particularly sought after {{at this time of the}} year. An account by Admiral Steven van der Hagen from 1606 even suggests that the grey parrots of Mauritius were sometimes killed for amusement.|$|E
5|$|Although Domnall {{had earlier}} opposed Muirchertach over the kingship of Munster, he possessed strong {{familial}} {{connections with the}} Isles through his maternal descent from Echmarcach. In fact, the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster reveals {{that at least two}} apparent members of Echmarcach's family were killed less than a decade before in a repulsed invasion of Mann. As a result of their demise, Domnall may well have become the leading male representative of his mother's family. From the <b>standpoint</b> <b>of</b> the Uí Briain, the union of Domnall's parents would, therefore, seem to have been orchestrated in the context of extending Uí Briain authority into the Isles. In 1096, the Annals of the Four Masters reveals that Domnall's brother, Amlaíb, lost his life on Mann, apparently whilst supporting Domnall's undertaking in the Isles. This source not only corroborates Uí Briain intervention in the Isles, but suggests that Domnall {{and the rest of the}} Meic Taidc faced significant opposition there, possibly in the form of Lagmann's adherents. The chronicle credits Domnall with an oppressive three-year reign that ended when the leading Islesmen revolted against him, and drove him from the kingdom back to Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The Gorkha {{aristocracy}} had led Nepal into disaster on {{the international}} front but preserved the political unity of the country, which {{at the end of}} the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1816 still was only about twenty-five years old as a unified nation. The success of the central government rested in part on its ability to appoint and control regional administrators, who also were high officers in the army. In theory these officials had great local powers; in practice they spent little energy on the daily affairs of their subjects, interfering only when communities could not cope with problems or conflicts. Another reason for Gorkha success in uniting the country was the willingness to placate local leaders by preserving areas where former kings and communal assemblies continued to rule under the loose supervision of Kathmandu, leaving substantial parts of the country out of the control of regional administrators. Even within the areas directly administered by the central government, agricultural lands were given away as jagir to the armed services and as birta to court favorites and retired servicemen. The holder of such grants in effect became the lord of the peasants working there, with little if any state interference. From the <b>standpoint</b> <b>of</b> the average cultivator, the government remained a distant force, and the main authority figure was the landlord, who took part of the harvest, or (especially in the Tarai) the tax collector, who was often a private individual contracted to extort money or crops in return for a share. For the leaders in the administration and the army, as military options became limited and alternative sources of employment grew very slowly, career advancement depended less on attention to local conditions than on loyalty to factions fighting at court.|$|E

I was interested in how well {{they are aware of}} individual specialized terms, what do they think about the effect and impact of the inclusion on pupils and the class, if they feel competent to teach sports education among physically impaired pupils and if teachers are prepared to include physically impaired pupils into sports education. The pattern contains 35 teachers, 18 of them are 1 st triennial period teachers and 17 2 nd triennial period teachers. The results, which base on the Ajzen theory of planned behaviour, showed, that teachers have a positive standpoint towards the inclusion of physically impaired pupils in sports education.
