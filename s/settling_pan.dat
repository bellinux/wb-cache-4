50|$|A solvent style parts washer {{is filled}} with several gallons of solvent that is stored in a <b>settling</b> <b>pan</b> {{at the bottom of}} the washer. A small flame-tight {{electric}} liquid pump is immersed in the solvent and skims clean solvent from near the top of the settling tank, and pumps it at low pressure through a stiff flexible nozzle onto a metal grating above the liquid where the metal components rest. Dirt and dissolved heavy greases fall into the bottom and settle to the bottom of the tank.|$|E
50|$|The Jaitmathang lands {{were first}} {{penetrated}} and settlements {{began to be}} established there, in 1828. Following the Victorian gold rush, miners also discovered gold in the Omeo area, at Livionstone Creek, off the Mitta Mitta river, and as the news spread, a large mass of gold-diggers rushed to <b>settle</b> and <b>pan</b> {{the waters of the}} area. Within a decade, by 1862, only 4-5 Jaitmathang could be counted who had survived the disruption.|$|R
50|$|Outside {{the snowy}} {{mountain}} town of Lahood, California, thugs working for big-time miner Coy LaHood ride in {{and destroy the}} camp {{of a group of}} prospectors and their families who have <b>settled</b> to <b>pan</b> for gold in nearby Carbon Canyon. While leaving, they shoot a dog belonging to fourteen-year-old Megan Wheeler. As Megan buries her dog in the woods and prays for a miracle, thunder rolls and a stranger rides down the slopes.|$|R
6000|$|Slats, {{who wanted}} to be a lady killer, would say: [...] "Wal, Button, what did your school marm say about me today?" [...] And Hookey would make fun of Pilldarlick, which ridicule had more power to hurt Pan than {{anything}} else. One day Pan gave way to fury, and with flying rocks he chased Hookey into the cellar, and every time Hookey poked up his head Pan would fling a stone with menacing accuracy. That time his mother came to the rescue of the cowboy. After that Hookey bought a new saddle and gave Pan his old one. That <b>settled</b> hostilities. <b>Pan</b> had a change of heart. No matter how Hookey teased or tormented him he could never again make him angry. Pan saw Hookey with different eyes.|$|R
5000|$|The dirt hole set: Developed by Adirondak trapper E.J. Dailey, a hole is dug at a forty five degree {{angle and}} a shallow {{depression}} is scooped {{out in front}} of the hole, big enough to fit the trap. The stake is under the trap. The trap is covered with finely sifted dirt. Some leaves or a small sponge is placed under the trap pan so that dirt does not <b>settle</b> under the <b>pan</b> and prevent it from being sprung. Lure or bait is placed in the hole. This set-up should be placed near the corner of fields or in the forest along ridges or rock walls.|$|R
2500|$|When it was {{initially}} named as such, the Pan d'Auriac was mainly {{a place of}} settlement, before becoming the quartier des pénitents blancs [...] who <b>settled</b> there. The <b>Pan</b> d'Aygues-Passe (or Aigues-Passe), meaning [...] "water that passes", owes {{its name to the}} inclination of its streets, where the water flowed during cleaning. The Pan de Champnau derives its name from new field, and includes what was a new residential area, at north of the city. The Pan de Chastel is the old commercial district of the city. It is located towards the Chastel Gate, which led then to Chastel-Nouvel, where a castle stood which was property of the bishops. Finally the Pan des Claustres, whose name comes from cloisters, was the largest of the city and is now between the [...] and , i.e. between the two tombs of [...] (the chapel Saint-Ilpide on the hill of the executioner, and the crypt of Sainte-Thècle under the cathedral square).|$|R
