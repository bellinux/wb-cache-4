50|$|To {{read from}} the device, a bit {{location}} was selected and a pulse sent from the cathode. If the dielectric for that bit contained a charge, the electrons would be pushed off the dielectric and read as a brief pulse of current in the <b>signal</b> <b>plate.</b> No such pulse meant that the dielectric must not have held a charge.|$|E
50|$|Writing was {{accomplished}} by selecting a bit, as above, and then sending a pulse of potential, either positive or negative, to the <b>signal</b> <b>plate.</b> With a bit selected, electrons would be pulled onto (with a positive potential) or pushed from (negative potential) the dielectric. When the bias on the grid was dropped, the electrons were trapped on the dielectric as a spot of static electricity.|$|E

40|$|The Krafla {{volcanic}} {{system has}} geothermal areas within the Krafla caldera and at Bjarnarflag in the Krafla fissure swarm, 9 -km {{south of the}} Krafla caldera. Arrays of boreholes extract geothermal fluids for power plants in both areas. We collected and analyzed InSAR, GPS, and leveling data spanning 1993 – 2015 in order to investigate crustal deformation in these areas. The volcanic zone hosting the geothermal areas is also subject to large scale regional deformation processes, including plate spreading and deflation of the Krafla volcanic system. These deformation processes {{have to be taken}} into account in order to isolate the geothermal deformation <b>signal.</b> <b>Plate</b> spreading produces the largest horizontal displacements, but the regional deformation pattern also suggests readjustment of the Krafla system at depth after the 1975 – 1984 Krafla rifting episode. Observed deformation can be fit by an inflation source at about 20 km depth north of Krafla and a deflation source at similar depth directly below the Krafla caldera. Deflation signal along the fissure swarm can be reproduced by a 1 -km wide sill at 4 km depth closing by 2 – 4 cm per year. These sources are considered to approximate the combined effects of vertical deformation associated with plate spreading and post-rifting response. Local deformation at the geothermal areas is well resolved in addition to these signals. InSAR shows that deformation at Bjarnarflag is elongated along the direction of the Krafla fissure swarm (∼ 4 km by ∼ 2 km) while it is circular at Krafla (∼ 5 km diameter). Rates of deflation at Krafla and Bjarnarflag geothermal areas have been relatively steady. Average volume decrease of about 6. 6 × 10 ⁵ m³/yr for Krafla and 3. 9 × 10 ⁵ m³/yr for Bjanarflag are found at sources located at ∼ 1. 5 km depth, when interpreted by a spherical point source of pressure. This volume change represents about 8 × 10 − 3 m³/ton of the mass of geothermal fluid extracted per year, indicating important renewal of the geothermal reservoir by water flow...|$|E

Here we investigate {{the involvement of}} the Janus kinase (JAK) /signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway in integrin-mediated <b>signaling.</b> <b>Plating</b> primary human endothelial cells from umbilical cord and the human endothelial cell line ECV 304 on matrix proteins or on antibody to β 1 - or αv-integrin subunits induces transient tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK 2 and STAT 5 A. Consistent with a role for the JAK/STAT pathway in regulation of gene transcription, adhesion to matrix proteins leads to the formation of STAT 5 A-containing complexes with the serum-inducible element of c-fos promoter. Stable expression of a dominant negative form of STAT 5 A in NIH 3 T 3 cells reduces fibronectin-induced c-fos mRNA expression, indicating the involvement of STAT 5 A in integrin-mediated c-fos transcription.

The radio frequency (RF) signal from the antenna passes through the bandpass filter C1, L1, L2, C2 and is applied to the grid of the directly heated triode, V1. The capacitor C6 bypasses the RF signal around the audio transformer winding T2 which would block it. The amplified <b>signal</b> from the <b>plate</b> of the tube is applied to the RF transformer L3, L4 while C3 bypasses the RF signal around the headphone coils.

Using a control point specification style in the high level description greatly simplified the design by placing the burden of specifying the controller on the digital synthesizer. The basic design and low level simulation are presented {{as well as the}} design methodology. The purpose of the AGS Transverse Damper is to control instabilities and injection errors that may arise in high intensity proton beams being accelerated in the AGS. The system block diagram for the DSP is shown in Figure 1. The inputs to the system come from a normalization unit. This normalization unit takes two signals as input, a sum of beam position <b>signal</b> <b>plates,</b> and a difference from the plates. The output of the normalization unit is the difference divided by the sum. This Quotient is sent to the first ALU (as Qin[11 [...] 0]). Taking differences between position measurements the system acts as a notch filter. The Second ALU computes a running sum of the output of the first ALU. This then acts to remove any offsets in the Quotient (and thus this part acts as a high pass filter - removing any baseline components to the signal). The depth of the first FIFO (between adder and subtract units) basically determines the low pass behaviour. The multiplier serves the purpose of overall loop gain for the system (the complete system is a real-time feedback system). The FIFO on the output is used to provide the correct amount of delay for the system...|$|R

Using a suite of GIA model predictions that incorporate both 1 -D and 3 -D Earth rheologies, we show that, given the present location of GPS sites within East Antarctica, unmodelled or mismodelled GIA signal within GPS velocities produces biased estimates of plate rotation. When biased plate rotation is removed from the GPS velocities, errors as large as 0. 8 mm yr− 1 are introduced; a value commonly larger than the predicted GIA signal magnitude.

First, Match pursuit algorithm is used to the original signal processing of guided wave detection to improve signal quality, and provides a good foundation for signal reconstruction. Then it does algebraic difference of the <b>signal</b> before <b>plate</b> injury and the signal after injury to obtain the difference signal, and it uses the difference signal as time reversal excitation signal to obtain a set of time reversal signal.

Experimental results show that this method can accurately extract the envelope of the signal, and more accurately detect the position of the defect, the range and other characteristics.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design requirements for embedded piezoelectric plate transducers suitable for generating efficient, uni-modal Lamb wave <b>signals</b> in <b>plate</b> structures. Three piezoelectric materials are considered, modified lead titanate, lead zirconate titanate, and polyvinylidene difluoride, {{in conjunction with}} different 1 - 3 piezoelectric composite configurations. Finite element modelling was used to predict the various Lamb wave modes generated by transducers embedded in a hard-set epoxy plate. Accordingly, the design requirements for successful generation of the zeroth order symmetric (So) Lamb wave mode have been identified.

The amplitude of the Lamb wave signal can be optimised by appropriate choice of the transducer lateral dimension.
