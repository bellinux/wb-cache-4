40|$|The various {{surviving}} disc and composite brooches provide {{proof of}} the skill and craftsmanship of Anglo-Saxon metalsmiths. Surprisingly, no one has conducted a full geometrical analysis of these brooches to discover the design process preceding the casting and decoration. This thesis endeavors to rectify this through a geometrical investigation of the sophisticated geometrical planning principles used by Anglo-Saxon craftsmen {{in the creation of}} these elaborate brooches. Through the use of <b>simple</b> <b>geometrical</b> <b>constructions,</b> smiths were able to create works of great beauty and sophistication. Closer inspection reveals that Anglo-Saxon smiths produced all the composite disc brooches in this study using similar processes of planning. In order to plan out the compositions of each brooch, master smiths would only need a compass, a straightedge, and some material on which to write. Each brooch reveals the same kind of coherent geometry, sharing traits and patterns; with proportions tend to be governed by a series of modular association. Although the master smiths or designers of the composite brooches used simple tools to create the composition, the figures in this thesis were created using the Vectorworks CAD program. This significantly expedited the analytical process and allowed for exact measurements. Despite using the computer program to replicate the planning process, all the figures can be recreated with just a compass and straightedge. While a complete geometric study of all the composite disc brooches needs to be done, this study examines five of the best preserved and well-crafted of that type, ranging from some of the simplest to the most elaborate, as an introduction to the subject...|$|E

40|$|The {{anisotropic}} spreading of a paraxial beam propagating orthogonally to {{the optical}} axis inside a uniaxial crystal is investigated. The lack of rotational invariance around the propagation direction suggests {{to consider the}} mean square width (MSW) of the beam in any transverse direction, which {{turn out to be}} a quadratic form of the unit vector associated with the considered direction and to depend quadratically on the propagation distance z. The z-evolution of the MSW is compared with its standard evolution in vacuum. A simple connection is establish, for cylindrically symmetric input fields, between the anisotropic and the free space MSW, which in particular allows us to easily picture the spreading of the beam by means of a <b>simple</b> <b>geometrical</b> <b>construction.</b> The particular case of an astigmatic Gaussian beam is analytically carried out...|$|R

Within our model classical phase space points are represented by equivalence classes of wavefunctions that have identical position and momentum expectation values. Transport of these equivalence classes without dispersion leads {{to a system of}} wavefunction dynamics such that the expectation values track classical trajectories precisely for arbitrarily long times. Interestingly, the value of ħ proves immaterial for the purpose of constructing this alternative representation of classical point mechanics. The new feature which ħ does mediate concerns a simple embedding of the quantum geometric phase within classical mechanics. We discuss problems of physical interpretation and discover a simple route to recover the ordinary linear Schrödinger equation...|$|R

40|$|Standard {{migration}} techniques {{require a}} velocity model. A new and fast prestack time migration method is presented {{that does not}} require a velocity model as an input. The only input is a shot gather, unlike other velocity-independent migrations that also require input of data in other gathers. The output of the presented migration is a time-migrated image and the migration velocity model. The method uses the first and second derivatives of the traveltimes with respect to the location of the receiver. These attributes are estimated by computing the gradient of the amplitude in a shot gather. The assumptions of the approach are a laterally slowly changing velocity and reflectors with small curvatures; the dip of the reflector can be arbitrary. The migration velocity corresponds to the root mean square (rms) velocity for laterally homogeneous media for near offsets. The migration expressions for 2 D and 3 D cases are derived from a <b>simple</b> <b>geometrical</b> <b>construction</b> considering the image of the source. The strengths and weaknesses of the methods are demonstrated on synthetic data. At last, the applicability of the method is discussed by interpreting the migration velocity in terms of the Taylor expansion of the traveltime around the zero offset...|$|R
40|$|The {{fact that}} {{political}} choice by majority rule {{may lead to}} voting cycles {{has been the subject}} of ongoing scholarly concern since it was rediscovered some fifty years ago by Duncan Black and Kenneth Arrow. However, part of this research has revealed an apparent anomaly: while a variety of theoretical results suggest that they are pervasive, it has been relatively difficult to turn up empirical evidence of voting cycles, even where appropriate data — that is, data on individual preference orderings over three (or more) candidates, parties, or legislative alternatives — are available. In this paper, I address this apparent discrepancy between formal theory and common empirical findings. In the first section, I briefly review some relevant theory and the empirical findings, introducing some notation, terminology, concepts along the way, and then observe there is no logical tension between the theoretical and empirical results. In the remaining sections, I go beyond this observation to show theoretically that only in quite exceptional circumstance can a voting cycle exist among three alternatives embedded in a space of two (or more) dimensions, where voters have preferences based on Euclidean distance. In doing this, I exploit a <b>simple</b> <b>geometrical</b> <b>construction</b> suggested by recent empirical and theoretical work...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{review the}} {{evolution}} of concepts on and methods of estimating the state of stress from fault movements. Theories of failure in isotropic materials suggested a <b>simple</b> <b>geometrical</b> <b>construction</b> of optimal principal stress directions from a fault plane and its associated slip. These optimal directions align shear stress and slip directions and maximize the difference between shear stress and frictional resistance on the fault plane. Optimal stress directions for calcite twinning are obtained by a similar construction, with the difference that they maximize shear stress. Force representation of seismic sources independently introduced pressure, P, and tension, T, axes at positions that also maximize shear stress on both nodal planes. Frictional slip theory and the constraint that slip and shear stress directions be parallel allowed to address reactivation of pre-existing faults. This suggested that stress could also be inverted from reactivated fault and slip data or earthquake focal mechanisms. Early methods relied on <b>geometrical</b> <b>constructions</b> {{as a substitute for}} calculations, whereas later methods relied on software as these calculations became tractable with the help of computers. Similar methods were developed for the inversion of stress from crystal twin gliding with non-optimal geometry, with a different criterion that relies on a threshold of the component of shear stress along the gliding line. Even though these methods seek a common stress tensor compatible with fault and slip data, their main use is to separate polyphase data into homogeneous subsets and help deciphering complex tectonic histories. Fault and slip data can also be analyzed to constrain the strain rather than the stress tensor. In most cases this involves a summation and yields an average strain for the considered rock volume. Stress inversion thus appears better suited for differentiating heterogeneous data whereas strain analysis appears better suited for homogenizing them...|$|R
