40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between global and domain measures of quality of life from a psychometric perspective by three different factor structure models. Three hundred and four students at National Taiwan University participated in this study. They completed the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS, a global measurement for quality <b>of</b> life) and <b>the</b> WHOQOL-BREF (a domain-specific measurement for quality of life). Three models were specified to examine <b>the</b> relationships among <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SWLS and the WHOQOL-BREF. The first model was a common factor model in which <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SWLS and the WHOQOL-BREF were all influenced by a single factor. The second model was a correlated two-factor model in which <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SWLS were influenced by one factor and <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WHOQOL-BREF influenced by another factor, with these two factors being allowed to be correlated. The third model was a three-factor model, in which one factor (representing quality <b>of</b> life) influenced <b>the</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SWLS and the WHOQOL-BREF, another factor (representing global approach) only influenced <b>the</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SWLS, and yet another factor (representing domain approach) only influenced <b>the</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WHOQOL-BREF. The results showed that the third model was the best, suggesting that global measures (the SWLS) and domain measures (the WHOQOL-BREF) did assess the same construct on quality <b>of</b> life, however, <b>the</b> measurement approaches they adopted (global or domain approach) also have substantial impact on <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>scores...</b>|$|R

5|$|During {{the initial}} {{run at the}} Queen's Theatre the {{publisher}} John Walsh printed Songs in the Opera of Rinaldo, in mainly short score form. Apart from the overture, instrumental numbers were omitted, as were the recitatives. In June 1711 Walsh published a fuller version, which included instrumental parts; he continued to publish versions of individual numbers, {{with a variety of}} orchestrations, until the 1730s. In 1717 William Babell issued an arrangement for harpsichord of the overture and seven of the arias. Friedrich Chrysander published editions of the whole opera in 1874 and in 1894, based on a study of the existing published and manuscript material. In 1993 David Kimbell, for the Hallische Händel-Ausgabe (HHA), produced a full <b>score</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1711 version, together with rejected draft material and the additional numbers introduced in revivals up to 1717.
