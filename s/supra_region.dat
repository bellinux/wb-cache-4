40|$|This letter {{reports on}} quasi-coherent (QC) modes {{observed}} in fluctuation spectra from Tore Supra and TEXTOR reflectometers. QC modes have characteristics in between coherent and broad-band fluctuations as they oscillate around a given frequency {{but have a}} wide spectrum. They are ballooned at the LFS midplane and appear usually on a frequency ranging from 30 to 120 &nbsp;kHz. In ohmic plasmas from both tokamaks, QC modes are detected only in linear ohmic confinement (LOC) regime and disappear in saturated ohmic confinement (SOC) regime. Linear simulations from Tore Supra predict that the LOC and SOC regimes are dominated by electron and ion modes respectively. Measurements of the perpendicular velocity of density fluctuations have been made {{from the top of}} TEXTOR by poloidal correlation reflectometry. They suggest that QC modes have a phase velocity ∼ 400 &nbsp;m&nbsp;s − 1 higher in the electron diamagnetic direction than lower frequency fluctuations. Additionally, the onset of QC modes during electron cyclotron resonance heating has been observed in a Tore <b>Supra</b> <b>region</b> where turbulence is suspected to be driven by electron modes. These experimental results and instability calculations show a correlation between onsets of QC modes and predictions of trapped electron modes...|$|E

40|$|Craniopharyngiomas are a {{challenging}} pathology in neurosurgery {{because of their}} anatomic localization in the (<b>supra)</b> sellar <b>region</b> and their contact with diencephalic structures around the third ventricle. Among the different treatment modalities, stereotactic intracavitary treatment by instillation of yttrium(90) radioisotope is a minimally invasive technique of particular use {{in the treatment of}} cystic or partially cystic craniopharyngiomas. It can be performed under local anesthesia during a short hospitalization and has a long-lasting effect. This treatment can be repeated or used in combination with other treatment modalities such as microsurgery, endoscopy, conformal external radiation therapy, or stereotactic radiosurgery. Thus, this old and perhaps almost forgotten treatment option is still valuable in the treatment of cystic craniopharyngiomas...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis report {{presents}} a sixty year old female with unusual appearance of bilateral xanthelasma palpebrarum of periorbital region. These lesions were approximately 7 cm× 3 cm in dimensions. Patient’s main complaints were aesthetic appearance and hindrance in downward gaze. Considering {{the size of}} the lesions surgical excision was planned and the raw area covered with full thickness skin grafts from <b>supra</b> clavicular <b>region.</b> The aesthetic and functional outcome was good. The aim of this case report is to put forward an unusual presentation of xanthelasma, {{at the same time to}} keep in mind the surgical excision with full thickness skin grafting as an excellent treatment modality for periorbital xanthelasma palpebrarum especially in large lesions where other modalities have their own limitations...|$|R

40|$|Neuro {{cutaneous}} melanocytosis (NCM) is a non-familial, congenital disorder {{characterized by}} multiple congenital nevi and brain or leptomeningeal abnormal melanin deposits. Here, we present an adult onset NCM. A 17 -year-old boy presented with headache and double vision for 1 month. Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the brain}} showed hydrocephalus and abnormal meningeal hyper intensities in <b>supra</b> and infratentorial <b>regions</b> predominantly in the posterior fossa. Para medullary region showed an 11 × 10 mm nodular contrast enhancing nodule. Resection of an intramedullary central nervous system lesion revealed melanoma while skin biopsy was benign melanocytic nevus. As per Kadonaga and Frieden criteria, a diagnosis of NCM was made.

40|$|The {{extended}} frontobasal approach {{provides an}} adequate midline exposure from the anterior cranial fossa to the sphenoclival region. Between November 1991 and August 1999, 13 patients with extensive anterior and anterolateral skull base tumours extending to <b>supra</b> and parasellar <b>regions,</b> cavernous sinus and sphenoclival regions were operated upon using this approach alone (7 patients) {{or in combination}} with subtemporal -infratemporal (4 patients) or transfacial (2 patients) approaches. Gross total excision was performed in 8 patients while in 4 patients with malignant tumours and in a patient with extensive skull base fungal granuloma, only partial excision was possible. Basal repair was performed using pedicled pericranium, temporalis muscle or fascia lata. The complications included increase in the cranial nerve paresis, endophthalmitis, facial oedema, CSF leak, frontal haematoma and internal carotid artery injury. This study reviews the operative technique, the indications and the complications of extended frontobasal approach...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} PET study we explore some {{functional}} {{aspects of the}} interaction between attentional/control processes and learning/memory processes. The network of brain regions supporting recall of abstract designs were studied in a less practiced and in a well practiced state. The results indicate that automaticity, i. e., a decreased dependence on attentional and working memory resources, develops as a consequence of practice. This corresponds to the practice related decreases of activity in the prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and posterior parietal regions. In addition, the activity of the medial temporal regions decreased as a function of practice. This indicates an inverse relation between the strength of encoding and the activation of the MTL during retrieval. Furthermore, the pattern of practice related increases in the auditory, posterior insular-opercular extending into perisylvian <b>supra</b> marginal <b>region,</b> and the right mid occipito-temporal region, may reflect a lower degree of inhibitory attentional modulation of task irrelevant processing and more fully developed representations of the abstract designs, respectively. We also suggest that free recall is dependent on bilateral prefrontal processing, in particular non-automatic free recall. The present results cofirm previous functional neuroimaging studies of memory retrieval indicating that recall is subserved by a network of interacting brain regions. Furthermore, the results indicate that some components of the neural network subserving free recall may have a dynamic role {{and that there is a}} functional restructuring of the information processing networks during the learning process...|$|R
40|$|Syringocystadenoma papilliferum {{is a rare}} adnexal tumor {{that often}} occurs as a solitary tumor {{in the head and}} neck region, {{although}} occurrences on other anatomical locations have been described. Linear configurations have been described, but an agminated form is a more rare and underreported variant of this tumor. We describe a case of a healthy 10 -year old female with agminated syringocystadenoma papilliferum occurring on her left supraclavicular region, with the clinical appearance of grouped molluscum contagiosum papules. Case synopsis A healthy 10 -year-old girl was referred for the treatment of a "collection of molluscum contagiosum" of the left <b>supra</b> clavicular <b>region</b> of several years duration. The lesions were asymptomatic and refractory to cryotherapy. The patient was a healthy girl with no significant systemic findings. Cutaneous exam revealed a clustered group of pink, dome shaped, umbilicated papules over a 1. 5 x 1 cm area within the left supraclavicular fossa (Figure 1 a). An excisional biopsy was performed. Routine H&E stained sections revealed cystic epidermal invaginations with papillary projections. The superficial portions of the cyst were lined by stratified keratinizing epithelium, whereas the deeper papillated portion exhibited a double layer of basal-like cells and luminal eosinophilic columnar cells with focal decapitation secretion. The papillary structures contained fibrovascular cores and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates. A component of hamartomatous follicular growth was not identified (Figure 1 b-d.).   A diagnosis was made of agminated syringocystadenoma papilliferum...|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), previous reports {{have shown a}} severe white matter (WM) damage involving <b>supra</b> and infratentorial <b>regions</b> including cerebellum. In the present study, we investigated potential correlations between WM integrity loss and clinical-cognitive features of {{patients with}} PSP. By using magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging with tract based spatial statistic analysis, we analyzed WM volume in 18 patients with PSP and 18 healthy controls (HCs). All patients and HCs underwent a detailed clinical and neuropsychological evaluation. Relative to HCs, patients with PSP showed WM changes encompassing supra and infratentorial areas such as corpus callosum, fornix, midbrain, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiation, superior cerebellar peduncle, superior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, cingulate gyrus, and cortico-spinal tract bilaterally. Among different correlations between motor-cognitive features and WM structural abnormalities, we detected a significant association between fronto-cerebellar WM loss and executive cognitive impairment in patients with PSP. Our findings, therefore, corroborate the hypothesis that cognitive impairment in PSP may result from both "intrinsic" and "extrinsic" frontal lobe dysfunction, likely related to cerebellar disconnection...|$|R
40|$|The pterional {{craniotomy}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently surgical approaches used in neurosurgery and currently it has become a mainsteam. It allows excellent microsurgical exposure of anterior and posterior regions of the arterial circle of Willis, <b>supra</b> and paraselar <b>regions,</b> the superior orbital fissure of sphenoid bone, cavernous sinus, orbit, temporal lobe, midbrain and the frontal lobe. Like others techniques, the pterional craniotomy presented disadvantages related to dissection of the temporal muscle. From the first fronto lateral craniotomy described by Dandy to expose the optic chiasm and the pituitary we pass through the Yasargil's classical description of craniotomy centered in fronto-temporal sylvian fissure until reaching the recent"minipterional craniotomy", modifications of the pterional craniotomy were proposed to reduce the extra cranial tissue trauma and reduce the area of craniotomy without affecting the exposure of surgical targets, thus improving their aesthetic and functional results. An historical analysis of the frontolateral approaches has demonstrated that they have evolved from larger craniotomies to smaller ones, however only the minipterional craniotomy is able to offer similar surgical exposure...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) study which investigated whether brain areas involved in updating task rules within the frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex show activity related to the modality of motor response used in the task. Participants performed a rule switching task using different effector modalities. In some blocks participants responded with left/right button presses, whilst in other blocks left/right saccades were required. The color of a Cue event instructed a left or right response based upon a rule, followed by a Feedback which indicated whether the rule was to stay the same or "Flip" on the next trial. The findings revealed variation in the locus of activity within the ventrolateral frontal cortex dependent upon effector modality. Other frontal areas showed no significant difference in activity between response epochs but changed their pattern of connectivity with posterior cortical areas dependent upon response. Multivariate analysis revealed that the pattern of activity evoked by Flip rule Feedbacks within an apparently <b>supra</b> modal frontal <b>region</b> (dorsolateral frontal cortex) discriminated between response epochs. The results are consistent with the existence of multi-modal representations of stimulus-response (SR) rules within the frontal cerebral cortex...|$|R
40|$|Background: Tolosa-Hunt {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} case, characterized by tenderness, persistent around the affected eye and ophthalmoplegia /paresis caused by granulomatous inflammation in the cavernous sinus <b>region,</b> <b>supra</b> orbital or orbital fissure. Although spontaneous remission may occur, even corticosteroid therapy has a very satisfactory effect. However, relapse can occur after remission. We report a case of granulomatous Tolosa-Hunt syndrome in women aged 47 years who suffer from recurrent Tolosa-Hunt syndrome attacks for 4 years on his left eye, {{there was a significant}} recovery after receiving steroid therapy. Case:  We report A 47 years old with recurrent pain in the left eye since 4 years, pain episode duration of 1 - 2 weeks, accompanied by double vision when having long or short distance viewing, and when climbing stairs. The patient left eye was protruded with blurred vision and difficulty in distinguishing green color. Left eye examination vision 1 / 300, green color discromatopsia, normal funduscopic, ptosis, with paresis eye movement toward the superior, inferior, nasal and temporal. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were slightly elevated. ANA test was positive. In visual evoked potential, it showed latency elongation of the left face. Head MRI with contrast showed a isointense protrusion on the left cavernous sinus in axial cuts in T 1 and T 2. Head MRI T 1 with contrast on coronal, axial cuts showed the appearance of convex lesions around the left cavernous sinus that enhanced with contrast. Conclusions: The result was clinically and radiographically diagnosed as Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome (THS). Therefore, 10 mg dexamethasone therapy, 4 times a day for 3 days was lowered to three times on day 4, 2 times on the fifth day and one time at day 6. The patient showed clinical improvement. The patient continued 48 mg oral methylprednisolone therapy up to 3 weeks which then gradually decreased and planned head MRI 3 months later. </p...|$|R

A craniotomia pterional é um dos acessos cirúrgicos mais freqüentemente utilizados. Esta técnica permite excelente exposição microcirúrgica das regiões anterior e posterior do polígono de Willis, regiões supra-selar, fissura orbital superior do osso esfenóide, seio cavernoso, órbita, lobo temporal, mesencéfalo e lobo frontal. Como outras técnicas, a craniotomia pterional tem desvantagens relacionadas à manipulação do músculo temporal. Desde a primeira craniotomia fronto lateral descrita por Dandy para expor o quiasma óptico e a hipófise, passando pela descrição clássica de Yasrgil para craniotomia centrada na fissura silviana, até chegar em craniotomias recentes como a"minipterional", modificações da craniotomia pterional foram propostas para reduzir o trauma do tecido extra craniano e reduzir a área da craniotomia sem afetar a exposição dos alvos cirúrgicos e melhorar seus resultados estéticos e funcionais. Uma análise histórica das abordagens frontolaterais demonstrou que elas evoluíram a partir de craniotomias maiores para menores, contudo somente a craniotomia minipterional oferece exposição cirúrgica similar à craniotomia pterional clássica...|$|R
