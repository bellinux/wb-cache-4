40|$|There is a {{reservoir}} of knowledge in data from the TREC evaluations that analysis of precision and recall leaves untapped. This knowledge leads to better understanding of query expansion as this paper demonstrates. In many TREC tasks, the system response required is an ordered list of 1000 document identifiers. Instead of just using the identifiers to determine the positions of relevant documents in each list, we extract from each list the identifiers of the relevant documents and compare document ordering in these <b>sub-lists.</b> In other words, we consider the return order of relevant documents. We use Spearman's coefficient of rank correlation to compare <b>sub-lists</b> and multidimensional scaling to display the comparisons. Applying this methodology to data from the TREC Query Track, specifically, to system responses to twenty restatements of each of four topics, we show how two systems with query expansion differ from four systems without. We observe return-order variations caused by topic restatement and determine how query expansion affects these variations. For some topics, query expansion reduces the sizes of these variations considerably. 1...|$|R

Within the model, the environmental compartments air, freshwater, sediment and three different kinds of soil, namely natural, agricultural and rural/urban soil, are taken into account. It represents a level-III fugacity model assuming steady state but accounting for the emission compartment.

In this paper, we propose a new method, which partitions data using the cumulative distribution function. It partitions data of any distribution in linear time, independent to the number of sublists to be partitioned into. Experiments show 10 - 30 % improvement in partitioning balance and 20 - 70 % reduction in partitioning overhead. The new method is more scalable than existing methods.
