5|$|In 1994, {{when he was}} 10 years old, Samaras {{joined his}} boyhood heroes, OFI Crete. His father was playing for {{them at the time}} and then retired in 1996. Six months later, he became Academy chief manager, a {{position}} he retained until 2000, when he became manager. Samaras credits his father highly with helping start his football career. His influence meant that Samaras trained every day of his childhood and he also got to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> behind the scenes at OFI. Samaras left for Eredivisie club Heerenveen in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Sir Bobby Robson {{was raised}} {{a few miles}} away from Tow Law, in the village of Langley Park. He had held the title of life {{president}} at the club, and had helped them out when they hit financial difficulties after the 2001 foot and mouth crisis, which devastated the local area. He was known to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> on the club, attending fund raisers and giving talks. On 1 August 2009, the club held a minute's silence before their game with Workington, following his death the day before.|$|E
5|$|The game {{featured}} advanced {{artificial intelligence}} {{due to the}} inclusion of the game's squad command system. Adams and Lugo will assist Walker in battles and react to the battle situation accordingly even if they are not given any orders. They will also analyse the situation when instructed and decide the best approach to defeat enemies. The battle command system was designed to be accessible and easy to use, so that players would not have to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> managing the squad. Lugo and Adams may get severely injured and if both of them die, the game ends. This mechanic prompts the player to rescue them as quickly as possible, and the system is designed to create tense situations. The AI for enemies is affected by various factors, including visibility and hearing.|$|E

25|$|Narcissistic {{personality}} disorder (NPD) is a {{personality disorder}} {{in which there}} is a long-term pattern of abnormal behavior characterized by exaggerated feelings of self-importance, an excessive need for admiration, and a lack of understanding of others' feelings.

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) website shows {{that between the}} years 1900 and 2200, that the comet was and will be most significantly perturbed by Saturn on July 29, 1957. At that point it passed within 1.6AU of the giant planet's influence; even this approach had negligible effect. The comet's orbit appears to be stable between 1740 and 2167, with no strong perturbations {{by any of the}} planets.|$|E
25|$|Several weeks earlier, Irgun {{had learned}} about a Jewish refugee from Vienna named Aaron Weinberg, who had fled to Palestine and {{was working as a}} clerk at a British {{military}} resort camp in north Netanya. This information was already known to the local SHAI (the intelligence arm of the Haganah) commander, Yehoshua Bar-Ziv. Weinberg, who was a SHAI agent, was entrusted by Bar-Ziv with striking up a relationship with two sergeants from the British Army Intelligence Corps, Clifford Martin and Mervyn Paice, who used to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in the camp.|$|E
25|$|The shallowness of orca tanks forces orcas to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> at the surface. So {{much time}} at the surface leads to {{prolonged}} exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays. Prolonged exposure {{to the surface and}} UV rays is attributed to sunburns and the development of cataracts in orcas in captivity. Orcas in the wild would live at higher latitudes, meaning less intense sun, and spend more time in deeper, darker waters. While it is uncertain the effects of prolonged UV exposure to orcas' skin, since captive orca necropsies are extremely secretive, it seems logical that prolonged exposure to UV rays on unprotected skin would have the same negative effects such as melanoma (skin cancer) on orcas as it does on humans.|$|E

25|$|Fafhrd is a {{very tall}} (nearly seven feet) and strong {{northern}} barbarian, skilled at both swordsmanship and singing; the Mouser is a small (not much more than five feet) mercurial thief, gifted and deadly at swordsmanship (often using a sword {{in one hand and}} a long dagger—technically a main-gauche—in the other), and a former wizard's apprentice who retains some skill at magic. Fafhrd talks like a romantic, but his strong practicality usually wins through, while the cynical-sounding Mouser is prone to showing strains of sentiment at unexpected times. Both are rogues, living in a decadent world where to be so is a requirement of survival. They <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> drinking, feasting, wenching, brawling, stealing, and gambling, and are seldom fussy about who hires their swords. But they are humane and—most of all—relish true adventure.|$|E
25|$|The {{students}} <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> at IUT Library and Documentation Centre. It is on {{the first}} floor of the Library/Cafeteria building overlooking a lake on the eastern and western sides. The library has a floor area of 1300 sq. meters with a shelf space of 52,000 books. It is divided into two sections, General and Research/Reference. To conduct the IUT Library service, a customised software was developed and installed. The CSE (Computer Science and Engineering) department developed a new software for library management which is accessible through computers and cell phones. The data of projects/thesis/dissertations have been incorporated in the software. Now the faculty members and the students may search their desired books/dissertation from OPAC (On-line Public Access Catalogue). Local Area Network (LAN) in the IUT campus. There are 26,200 books on engineering, technical and vocational subjects. 20 technical journals are being subscribed from abroad annually. It is an open-shelf library. Books are issued to the students and staff for home use. It is open from 8.00am to 10.00pm on all working days and on one weekend 2.00pm. to 10.00pm.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Marlena {{takes in}} John Black as her patient; he has amnesia {{and she is}} {{determined}} to help him recover his past. John and Marlena <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> together, and the pair fall in love. However, John seems {{to know a lot}} about Stefano, leading Marlena to suspect he is Stefano. Later, Marlena finds a plastic surgeon's file containing before and after shots of both Roman and John. Marlena becomes convinced that John is Roman, and, over time, John took on the role of Roman. Marlena is later trying to talk down a suicidal jumper when she falls from a window ledge. Marlena lays in a coma, near death for a month. When she finally recovers, she and Roman renewed their vows on August 22, 1986. In his years with the ISA, Roman worked with a man named Orpheus. Roman accidentally killed Orpheus' wife while on assignment. To get back at Roman, Orpheus kidnaps Marlena and fakes her death. Roman shoots and kills Orpheus, but before he could rescue Marlena, she is presumed to have been killed in a plane crash.|$|E

25|$|Result: Odyssey {{got off to}} {{a strong}} start, as team leader Patrick had a lot of {{experience}} in the fashion industry. However, as {{he was the only one}} on his team to know anything about it, he had to <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> telling the others what could sell, which left less time for him to lead the team. Patrick also designed a kimono/wetsuit, which drew customers to the stall, but failed to sell. Halfway through the day, Patrick made the decision to leave the shopping centre they were selling at to try their luck selling to retailers. They had little success doing this however, and had to resort to selling all their customized stock to one retailer for £40, losing nearly £100 on the cost of creating them. On the girls' team, Ashleigh led from the front and made firm decisions, but the clothes they chose did not sell as well as on the boys' team. Nonetheless, the sub-team at the shopping centre managed to attract many customers, and eventually the team made a profit of £453.36, while Odyssey made a profit of £330.37.|$|E
