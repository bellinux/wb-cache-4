500|$|Films {{are a major}} form of entertainment, {{although}} not all films have entertainment as their primary purpose: documentary film, for example, aims to create a record or inform, although the two purposes often work together. The medium was a global business from the beginning: [...] "The Lumière brothers {{were the first to}} send cameramen throughout the world, instructing them to film everything which could be of interest for the public." [...] In 1908, Pathé launched and distributed newsreels and by World War I, films were meeting an enormous need for mass entertainment. [...] "In {{the first decade of the}} [...] century cinematic programmes combined, at random, fictions and newsfilms." [...] The Americans first [...] "contrived a way of producing an illusion of motion through successive images," [...] but [...] "the French were able to transform a <b>scientific</b> <b>principle</b> into a commercially lucrative spectacle". Film therefore became a part of the entertainment industry from its early days. Increasingly sophisticated techniques have been used in the film medium to delight and entertain audiences. Animation, for example, which involves the display of rapid movement in an art work, is one of these techniques that particularly appeals to younger audiences. The advent of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the 21st century made it [...] "possible to do spectacle" [...] more cheaply and [...] "on a scale never dreamed of" [...] by Cecil B. DeMille. From the 1930s to 1950s, movies and radio were the [...] "only mass entertainment" [...] but by the second decade of the 21st century, technological changes, economic decisions, risk aversion and globalisation reduced both the quality and range of films being produced. Sophisticated visual effects and CGI techniques, for example, rather than humans, were used not only to create realistic images of people, landscapes and events (both real and fantastic) but also to animate non-living items such as Lego normally used as entertainment as a game in physical form. Creators of The Lego Movie [...] "wanted the audience to believe they were looking at actual Lego bricks on a tabletop that were shot with a real camera, not what we actually did, which was create vast environments with digital bricks inside the computer." [...] The convergence of computers and film has allowed entertainment to be presented in a new way and the technology has also allowed for those with the personal resources to screen films in a home theatre, recreating in a private venue the quality and experience of a public theatre. This is similar to the way that the nobility in earlier times could stage private musical performances or the use of domestic theatres in large homes to perform private plays in earlier centuries.|$|E

[...] In this book Lassalle sought, {{in the words of}} Edward Bernstein, [...] "to establish a legal and <b>scientific</b> <b>principle</b> which shall once for all determine under what circumstances, and how far laws may be retroactive without violating the idea of right itself" [...] – that is, determining the circumstances under which laws may be made retroactive when they come into conflict with previously established laws.|$|E

60|$|Perhaps we may {{say that}} with him the {{philosophy}} of history is partly in the metaphysical stage, and see, in the progress of this idea from Herodotus to Polybius, the exemplification of the Comtian Law of the three stages of thought, the theological, the metaphysical, and the scientific: for truly out of the vagueness of theological mysticism this conception which we call the Philosophy of History was raised to a <b>scientific</b> <b>principle,</b> according to which the past was explained and the future predicted by reference to general laws.|$|E

Now, in Millais' [...] "Huguenot," [...] {{the figures}} were {{standing}} {{about three feet}} from the wall behind them; and the wise world of critics, which could find no other fault with the picture, professed to have its eyes hurt by the want of an aerial perspective, which, had it been accurately given (as, indeed, I believe it was), would have amounted to the 10/3-5000th, or less than the 15,000th part of the depth of any given color. It {{would be interesting to}} see a picture painted by the critics, upon this <b>scientific</b> <b>principle.</b> The aerial perspective usually represented is entirely conventional and ridiculous; a mere struggle {{on the part of the}} pretendedly well-informed, but really ignorant, artist, to express distances by mist which he cannot by drawing.|$|E
60|$|If {{these remarks}} are just; if the {{principles}} and rules of inference are the same whether we infer general propositions or individual facts; it follows that a complete logic of the sciences would be also a complete logic of practical business and common life. Since there is no case of legitimate inference from experience, in which the conclusion may not legitimately be a general proposition; {{an analysis of the}} process by which general truths are arrived at, is virtually an analysis of all induction whatever. Whether we are inquiring into a <b>scientific</b> <b>principle</b> or into an individual fact, and whether we proceed by experiment or by ratiocination, every step in the train of inferences is essentially inductive, and the legitimacy of the induction depends in both cases on the same conditions.|$|E

60|$|Ben, however, {{had great}} {{confidence}} in his own eyesight, and was determined to search the mystery to the bottom. For this purpose, when he was again left alone, {{he got out of}} bed and examined the window-shutters. He soon perceived a small chink in one of them, through which a ray of light found its passage and rested upon the ceiling. Now, the science of optics will inform us that the pictures of the white cow and the pigs, and of other objects out of doors, came into the dark chamber through this narrow chink, and were painted over Benjamin's head. It is greatly to his credit that he discovered the <b>scientific</b> <b>principle</b> of this phenomenon, and by means of it constructed a camera-obscura, or magic-lantern, out of a hollow box. This was of great advantage to him in drawing landscapes.|$|E
60|$|Such {{being the}} {{abstract}} theory of just remunerative payment, its application is practically modified {{by the fact}} that the order for labour, given in payment, is general, while the labour received is special. The current coin or document is practically an order on the nation for so much work of any kind; and this universal applicability to immediate need renders it so much more valuable than special labour can be, that an order for a less quantity of this general toil will always be accepted as a just equivalent for a greater quantity of special toil. Any given craftsman will always be willing to give an hour of his own work in order to receive command over half an hour, or even much less, of national work. This source of uncertainty, together with the difficulty of determining the monetary value of skill,[40] renders the ascertainment (even approximate) of the proper wages of any given labour in terms of currency, matter of considerable complexity. But they do not affect the principle of exchange. The worth of the work may not be easily known; but it has a worth, just as fixed and real as the specific gravity of a substance, though such specific gravity may not be easily ascertainable when the substance is united with many others. Nor is there so much difficulty or chance in determining it as in determining the ordinary maxima and minima of vulgar political economy. There are few bargains in which the buyer can ascertain with anything like precision that the seller would have taken no less;--or the seller acquire more than a comfortable faith that the purchaser would have given no more. This impossibility of precise knowledge prevents neither from striving to attain the desired point of greatest vexation and injury to the other, nor from accepting it for a <b>scientific</b> <b>principle</b> that he is to buy for the least and sell for the most possible, though what the real least or most may be he cannot tell. In like manner, a just person lays it down for a <b>scientific</b> <b>principle</b> that he is to pay a just price, and, without being able precisely to ascertain the limits of such a price, will nevertheless strive to attain the closest possible approximation to them. A practically serviceable approximation he can obtain. It is easier to determine scientifically what a man ought to have for his work, than what his necessities will compel him to take for it. His necessities can only be ascertained by empirical, but his due by analytical, investigation. In the one case, you try your answer to the sum like a puzzled schoolboy--till you find one that fits; in the other, you bring out your result within certain limits, by process of calculation.|$|E
60|$|GILBERT. It {{seems to}} me that with the {{development}} of the critical spirit we shall be able to realise, not merely our own lives, but the collective life of the race, and so to make ourselves absolutely modern, in the true meaning of the word modernity. For he to whom the present {{is the only thing that}} is present, knows nothing of the age in which he lives. To realise the nineteenth century, one must realise every century that has preceded it and that has contributed to its making. To know anything about oneself one must know all about others. There must be no mood with which one cannot sympathise, no dead mode of life that one cannot make alive. Is this impossible? I think not. By revealing to us the absolute mechanism of all action, and so freeing us from the self- imposed and trammelling burden of moral responsibility, the <b>scientific</b> <b>principle</b> of Heredity has become, as it were, the warrant for the contemplative life. It has shown us that we are never less free than when we try to act. It has hemmed us round with the nets of the hunter, and written upon the wall the prophecy of our doom. We may not watch it, for it is within us. We may not see it, save in a mirror that mirrors the soul. It is Nemesis without her mask. It is the last of the Fates, and the most terrible. It is the only one of the Gods whose real name we know.|$|E

A still more precious record of the fierce struggle of usury into life among Christians, and of the resistance to it by Venice and her [...] "Anthony,"[131] will {{be found in the}} dialogue [...] "della Usura," [...] of Messer Speron Sperone (Aldus, in Vinegia, MDXIII.), followed by the dialogue [...] "del Cathaio," [...] between [...] "Portia, sola, e fanciulla, fame, e cibo, vita, e morte, di ciascuno che la conosce," [...] and her lover Moresini, which is the source of all that is loveliest in the Merchant of Venice. Readers who seek more modern and more scientific instruction may consult the able abstract of the triumph of usury, drawn up by Dr. Andrew Dickson White, President of Cornell University ("The Warfare of Science," [...] H. S. King & Co., 1877), in which the victory of the great modern <b>scientific</b> <b>principle,</b> that two and two make five, is traced exultingly to the final overthrow of St. Chrysostom, St. Jerome, St. Bernard, St. Thomas Aquinas, Luther, and Bossuet, by [...] "the establishment of the Torlonia family in Rome." [...] A better collection of the most crushing evidence cannot be found than this, furnished by an adversary; a less petulant and pompous, but more earnest voice from America, [...] "Usury the Giant Sin of the Age," [...] by Edward Palmer (Perth Amboys, 1865), should be read together with it. In the meantime, the substance of the teaching of the former Church of England, in the great sermon against usury of Bishop Jewell, may perhaps not uselessly occupy one additional page of the Contemporary Review:-- ...|$|E
