5000|$|Unlike most typical speaker placements, <b>surround</b> <b>speakers</b> {{are often}} {{intended}} to radiate {{such that the}} sound reflects off walls so that the sound arrives at the listening position indirectly as a reflection rather than a direct wave. Often dipole (sometimes even quadrupole) speakers are used to do this, especially in small or home theater applications where an array of <b>surround</b> <b>speakers</b> as {{in a movie theater}} is not practical or possible. A common misconception is that surround channels are [...] "rear channels." [...] However, when only two speakers are used, they are meant to be placed on the side walls at 90-110 degrees relative to the screen. <b>Surround</b> <b>speakers</b> are placed above the listeners ears and are not angled towards the listener. In cinema setups, many more than two <b>surround</b> <b>speakers</b> are often used, being placed along the side walls and along the back wall, creating a very diffused sound in the auditorium.|$|E
50|$|Especially in {{the case}} of stereo content where {{ambience}} has been purposely reduced (because a natural level coming from front 60°-only is perceived as too much), additional signals for <b>surround</b> <b>speakers</b> can be produced using a measured hall impulse response, convolved in a PC with the two front channel signals. For full ambiophonic replay, one PC can provide the DSP for 4-channel crosstalk-cancellation and four or more (up to 16 depending on the PC) <b>surround</b> <b>speakers.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A few manufacturers, notably Sony and Panasonic, have {{implemented}} wireless connection {{technology for the}} <b>surround</b> <b>speakers</b> in this class of equipment. This technology may be available as standard {{with some of the}} high-priced models or may be supplied as an aftermarket kit that only works with selected models in the manufacturer's range. It usually manifests in a line-level feed over a proprietary wireless link to a separate power amplifier used for the surround-sound channels. This link-receiver and power amplifier can be built into one of the <b>surround</b> <b>speakers</b> or housed in a black box that the <b>surround</b> <b>speakers</b> are connected to. Some higher-end HTIB models offer additional features such as 1080i or 4k ( [...] mainly versions with Blu-ray) video resolution upscaling, a 5-disc platter, HDMI inputs, USB connectivity, Bluetooth support, Wifi support, internet apps, DAB and DAB+, mirroring possibility, iPod dock and a hard disk.|$|E
50|$|Bose {{has been}} selling stereo speaker {{packages}} since 1966 and <b>surround</b> sound <b>speaker</b> packages since 1992. Since that time the company has produced a range of stereo and <b>surround</b> sound <b>speakers</b> to be powered by a receiver or amplifier.|$|R
50|$|Sorbian {{has also}} been spoken in the small Sorbian ("Wendish") {{settlement}} of Serbin in Lee County, Texas, {{and it is possible}} that a few speakers still remain there. Until recently newspapers were published in Sorbian there. The local dialect has been heavily influenced by <b>surrounding</b> <b>speakers</b> of German and English.|$|R
50|$|On June 18, 2010, Dolby {{introduced}} Dolby Surround 7.1, {{and set up}} theaters worldwide with 7.1 <b>surround</b> <b>speaker</b> setups {{to deliver}} theatrical 7.1 surround sound. The first film to be released with this format was Pixar's Toy Story 3 which was later followed by 50 releases using the format. As of April 2012, there are 3,600 Dolby Surround 7.1 movie theaters.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the usual}} {{multiple}} small <b>surround</b> <b>speakers</b> used in cinemas, the Quintaphonic system specified just two rear speakers, {{but of the}} same type as those used at the front.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, ambiophonics {{provides}} for the optional use of concert-hall or other ambience impulse response convolution to generate hall ambience signals for virtually any number and any placement of <b>surround</b> <b>speakers.</b> But ambiophonics is not for theaters, auditoriums, or any large groups. Ambiophonics can usually accommodate more than one listener since one can {{move back and forth}} along the line bisecting the speakers. Precisely because of the higher level of envelopment along this line, the loss of realism when one moves away from the center line is more dramatic in the case of Ambiophonics than stereo. The listening area can be enlarged with ambience convolution, whereby <b>surround</b> <b>speakers</b> mimic the contributions of concert-hall walls.|$|E
5000|$|DTS-ES Matrix {{provides}} 5.1 discrete channels, with a matrixed center-surround audio channel. DTS processors {{that are}} compatible with the ES codec look for and recognize [...] "flags" [...] built into the audio coding and [...] "unfold" [...] the rear-center sound from data {{that would otherwise be}} sent to rear <b>surround</b> <b>speakers.</b> DTS decoders which do not understand ES process the sound as if it were standard 5.1, and the matrixed audio for the center surround channel is output equally from the two <b>surround</b> <b>speakers</b> (very much as a sound intended to be in the centre of the sound field in a stereo recording is played equally by the left and right speakers). This is notated as DTS-ES 5.1.|$|E
5000|$|The [...]2 of the 10.2 {{refers to}} the {{addition}} of a second subwoofer. The system is bass managed such that all the speakers on the left side use the left sub and all the speakers on the right use the right sub. The Center and Back <b>Surround</b> <b>speaker</b> are split among the two subs. The two subs also serve as two discrete LFE (Low Frequency Effects) channels.|$|R

50|$|In August 2007, the Massachusetts state Information Technology Division awarded Cognos a $13 million {{contract}} for performance management software. This followed a 2006 $4.5 million state {{contract awarded to}} Cognos by the Massachusetts Department of Education. These contracts came under scrutiny from the State Ethics Commission {{and the office of}} state Inspector General Gregory Sullivan when several conflicts of interest <b>surrounding</b> <b>Speaker</b> of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Salvatore DiMasi and his accountant Richard Vitale came to light.|$|R
50|$|In {{recent years}} digital {{multi-channel}} sound systems, such as Dolby Digital and DTS, have become available which provide 6 or 8 discrete audio channels providing {{for not only}} the usual three screen speakers but also 2 or 4 groups of <b>surround</b> <b>speakers</b> and a sub-woofer.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} surround setup {{consists of}} three front speakers LCR (left, center and right), two <b>surround</b> <b>speakers</b> LS and RS (left and right surround respectively) and a subwoofer for the Low Frequency Effects (LFE) channel, that is low-pass filtered at 120 Hz. The angles between the speakers have been standardized by the ITU (International Telecommunication Union) recommendation 775 and AES (Audio Engineering Society) as follows: 60 degrees between the L and R channels (allows for two-channel stereo compatibility) with the center speaker {{directly in front of}} the listener. The Surround channels are placed 100-120 degrees from the center channel, with the subwoofer’s positioning not being critical due to the low directional factor of frequencies below 120 Hz. The ITU standard also allows for additional <b>surround</b> <b>speakers,</b> that need to be distributed evenly between 60 and 150 degrees.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, renovations {{included}} new balcony seating, {{replacing the}} original seats from 1914; {{the installation of}} Dolby Digital Sound and 24 <b>surround</b> <b>speakers</b> throughout the original auditorium; and a revamped projection booth, containing two Norelco DP-70 projectors. The Somerville {{is now one of}} the few theaters in New England that can run 70mm film.|$|E
500|$|Also in {{the product}} line-up were NS-10T, NS-10M X, NS-10MC, NS-10MT. The NS-10M X is a [...] "Studio" [...] with {{magnetic}} shielding and a different tweeter. In the 1990s Yamaha introduced the NS-10MT, a bass-reflex version of the 10M X with a different tweeter and grille. Designed for home cinema, it has bass response down to 43Hz, nominal impedance of 6 ohm and maximum power handling rated at 180W. A miniature version named Natural Sound <b>Surround</b> <b>Speaker</b> NS10MM was launched in 1997 or 1998.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is to {{identify}} types of segments that are difficult for speaker diarization systems. The diarization outputs of five state-of-the-art systems are analyzed on short/long seg-ments as well as segments <b>surrounding</b> <b>speaker</b> changepoints. We found that for all five systems as {{the duration of the}} segment decreased the diarization error rate (DER) increased. Also, seg-ments immediately preceding and following speaker change-points performed much worse than their respective counter-parts. In fact, at least 40 % of the DER for all five systems is attributed to time within 0. 5 seconds of a speaker changepoint. We hope the results of this work motivate future improvements of speaker diarization systems. Index Terms: speaker diarization, error analysis, rich transcrip-tio...|$|R
5000|$|The only {{addition}} with 12.2 from 10.2 are the [...] "point surround" [...] or [...] "diffuse surround" [...] channels.

They would emit sound to reflect off the walls before arriving at the listening area.The 14 discrete channels are: ...|$|E
50|$|Many Dolby Digital decoders are {{equipped}} with downmixing to distribute encoded channels to speakers. This includes such functions as playing surround information through the front speakers if <b>surround</b> <b>speakers</b> are unavailable, and distributing the center channel to left and right if no center speaker is available. When outputting to separate equipment over a 2-channel connection, a Dolby Digital decoder can optionally encode the output using Dolby Surround to preserve surround information.|$|E
50|$|In a 7.1 {{surround}} sound home theatre set-up, the <b>surround</b> <b>speakers</b> are placed {{to the side}} of the listener's position and the rear speakers are placed behind the listener. In addition, with the advent of Dolby Pro Logic IIz and DTS Neo:X, 7.1 {{surround sound}} can also refer to 7.1 surround sound configurations with the addition of two front height channels positioned above the front channels or two front wide channels positioned between the front and surround channels.|$|E
5000|$|Stereo {{receivers}} {{have two}} channels of amplification, while AV receivers {{may have more}} than two. The standard for AV receivers is five channels of amplification. These are usually referred to as 5.1 receivers. This provides for a left, right, center, left surround and right <b>surround</b> <b>speaker</b> to be powered by the receiver. 7.1 receivers are becoming more common and provide for two additional surround channels, left rear surround and right rear surround. The [...] ".1" [...] refers to the LFE (low-frequency effects/bass) channel, the signal of which is usually sent to an amplified subwoofer unit. 5.1 and 7.1 receivers don't usually provide amplification for this channel. Instead, they provide a line level output.|$|R

50|$|Commercial {{surround}} sound media include videocassettes, DVDs, and SDTV broadcasts encoded as compressed Dolby Digital and DTS, and lossless audio such as DTS HD Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD on HDTV Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD, which are {{identical to the}} studio master. Other commercial formats include the competing DVD-Audio (DVD-A) and Super Audio CD (SACD) formats, and MP3 Surround. Cinema 5.1 surround formats include Dolby Digital and DTS. Sony Dynamic Digital Sound (SDDS) is an 8 channel cinema configuration which features 5 independent audio channels across the front with two independent surround channels, and a Low-frequency effects channel. Traditional 7.1 <b>surround</b> <b>speaker</b> configuration introduces two additional rear speakers to the conventional 5.1 arrangement, {{for a total of}} four surround channels and three front channels, to create a more 360° sound field.|$|R
50|$|For music {{surround}} channel information {{is intended to}} be more direct as in a soundstage there would be direct noise from all around and not ambience as in a movie setting. For this reason <b>surround</b> <b>speakers</b> should not be set up to be strictly diffuse. Optimally there should be discrete {{surround channel}}s for diffuse and direct effects. This is part of the design for Tomlinson Holman's 10.2 surround sound. For movies surround channel information is usually more diffuse ambient noise.|$|E
5000|$|Todd-AO {{adopted a}} similar {{multi-channel}} magnetic sound {{system to the}} one developed for Cinemascope two years earlier, recorded on [...] "stripes" [...] of magnetic oxide deposited on the film. However Todd-AO has six channels instead of the four of Cinemascope and due to the wider stripes and faster film speed provides superior audio quality. Five of these six channels are fed to five speakers spaced behind the screen, and the sixth is fed to <b>surround</b> <b>speakers</b> around {{the walls of the}} auditorium.|$|E

50|$|A simple {{4-channel}} decoder {{could simply}} send the sum signal (L+R) {{to the center}} speaker, and the difference signal (L-R) to the surrounds. But such a decoder would provide poor separation between adjacent speaker channels, thus anything intended for the center speaker would also reproduce from left and right speakers only 3dB below the level in the center speaker. Similarly anything intended for the left speaker would be reproduced from both the center and <b>surround</b> <b>speakers,</b> again only 3dB below the level in the left speaker. There is, however complete separation between left and right, and between center and surround channels.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the visual impact of the image, Cinerama {{was one of the}} first processes to use multitrack magnetic sound. The system, developed by Hazard E. Reeves, one of the Cinerama investors, played back from a full coated 35 mm magnetic film with seven tracks of sound targeting a speaker layout similar to the more modern SDDS. There were five speakers behind the screen, two on the side and back of the auditorium with a sound engineer directing the sound between the <b>surround</b> <b>speakers</b> according to a script. The projectors and sound system were synchronized by a system using selsyn motors.|$|E
50|$|In {{commercial}} cinema, {{where there}} is a large area to cover, it would be impractical to use a single speaker for each surround channel. Theater auditoria are often lined with speakers all along the side and back walls. This is to increase the size of the listening area. JBL states that <b>surround</b> <b>speakers</b> should be spaced evenly along the side and back walls, starting at no closer than 1/3 of the room length from the screen (so the surrounds do not interfere with the front channels) and should be located at about 10-12 feet high and angled down to face the opposite wall-floor boundary.|$|E
