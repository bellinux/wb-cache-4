5|$|Octocorallia {{comprises}} the <b>sea</b> <b>pens</b> (Pennatulacea), soft corals (Alcyonacea), and blue coral (Helioporacea). Sea whips and sea fans, known as gorgonians, {{are part of}} Alcyonacea and historically were divided into separate orders.|$|E
5|$|In medusae {{the only}} {{supporting}} structure is the mesoglea. Hydra and most sea anemones close their mouths {{when they are}} not feeding, and the water in the digestive cavity then acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, rather like a water-filled balloon. Other polyps such as Tubularia use columns of water-filled cells for support. <b>Sea</b> <b>pens</b> stiffen the mesoglea with calcium carbonate s and tough fibrous proteins, rather like sponges.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoa is {{included}} within the phylum Cnidaria, {{which also includes}} the jellyfish, box jellies and parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa. The two main subclasses of Anthozoa are the Hexacorallia, members of which have six-fold symmetry and includes the stony corals, sea anemones, tube anemones and zoanthids; and the Octocorallia, which have eight-fold symmetry and includes the soft corals and gorgonians (<b>sea</b> <b>pens,</b> sea fans and sea whips), and sea pansies. The smaller subclass, Ceriantharia, consists of the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E
50|$|Actinoptilum molle, {{commonly}} known as the radial <b>sea</b> <b>pen</b> or purple <b>sea</b> <b>pen</b> (South Africa) is a species of <b>sea</b> <b>pen</b> in the family Echinoptilidae.|$|R

50|$|Ptilosarcus gurneyi, {{the orange}} <b>sea</b> <b>pen</b> or fleshy <b>sea</b> <b>pen,</b> is {{a species of}} <b>sea</b> <b>pen</b> in the family Pennatulidae. It is native to the northeastern Pacific Ocean where it lives in deep water {{anchored}} by its base in sand or mud. It has received its common name because of its resemblance to a quill in a bottle of ink.|$|R
5|$|Corals are {{classified}} in the class Anthozoa of the phylum Cnidaria. They are divided into three subclasses, Hexacorallia, Octocorallia, and Ceriantharia. The Hexacorallia include the stony corals, the sea anemones and the zoanthids. These groups have polyps that generally have 6-fold symmetry. The Octocorallia include blue coral, soft corals, <b>sea</b> <b>pens,</b> and gorgonians (sea fans and sea whips). These groups have polyps with 8-fold symmetry, each polyp having eight tentacles and eight mesenteries. Ceriantharia are the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E
5|$|The loggerhead {{sea turtle}} is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, such as gastropods, bivalves, and decapods. It has a greater list of known prey than any other sea turtle. Other food items include sponges, corals, <b>sea</b> <b>pens,</b> polychaete worms, sea anemones, cephalopods, barnacles, brachiopods, isopods, Portuguese men o' war, insects, bryozoans, sea urchins, sand dollars, sea cucumbers, starfish, fish (eggs, juveniles, and adults), {{hatchling}} turtles (including members of its own species), algae, and vascular plants. During migration through the open sea, loggerheads eat jellyfish, floating molluscs, floating egg clusters, squid, and flying fish.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoans are {{exclusively}} marine, {{and include}} sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals, <b>sea</b> <b>pens,</b> sea fans and sea pansies. Anthozoa {{is the largest}} taxon of cnidarians; over six thousand solitary and colonial species have been described. They {{range in size from}} small individuals less than half a centimetre across to large colonies a metre or more in diameter. They include species {{with a wide range of}} colours and forms that build and enhance reef systems. Although reefs and shallow water environments exhibit a great array of species, there are in fact more species of coral living in deep water than in shallow, and many taxa have shifted during their evolutionary history from shallow to deep water and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|Corals are {{animals in}} the Phylum Cnidaria and the class Anthozoa. Anthozoa is broken down into two subclasses Octocorals (Alcyonaria) and Hexacorals (Zoantharia). Octocorals are soft corals such as <b>sea</b> <b>pens.</b> Hexacorals include sea anemones and hard bodied corals. Octocorals contain eight body {{extensions}} while Hexacorals have six. Most deep-water corals are stony corals.|$|E
25|$|Clayoquot Slope {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of deep-sea organisms. Many {{demersal}} fish (fish which live very near the bottom) were observed (rockfish, flatfish, throny heads, and rattails) along with echinoderms (sea cucumbers, brittle stars, sea stars), octopus, crabs, cnidarians (<b>sea</b> <b>pens,</b> corals, anemones), and bacterial mats. In the water column, organisms such as squid, krill, jellyfish, siphonophores, and larvaceans have been observed during installation and maintenance work.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{mostly on}} marine snow—the {{continuous}} shower of mostly organic detritus falling from surface waters—little {{is known about}} the complicated food web connecting the organisms of the deep. Because of the harsh environment, there is a low density of organisms observed. Despite the low density, there is a fairly diverse community living on the abyssal plain. Installation and maintenance work has enabled a number of these organisms to be observed. The main groups of organisms observed include fish (skates and rattails), echinoderms (sea cucumbers, sea stars, brittle stars, and crinoids), molluscs (octopus and squid), <b>sea</b> <b>pens,</b> crabs, and squat lobsters. A number of pelagic (living in the water column) organisms were observed such as squid, jellyfish, ostracods, ctenophores, and salps.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the fossils}} are found as {{impressions}} of soft-bodied organisms {{in the shape}} of disks, ribbons or fronds. There are also trace fossils that provide evidence that some of these Precambrian organisms were most-likely worm-like creatures that were locomotive. Most of these fossils lack any recognizable heads, mouths or digestive organs, and are thought to have fed via absorptive mechanisms and symbiotic relationships with chemoautotrophs (Chemotroph), photoautotrophs (Phototroph) or osmoautotrophs. The ribbon-like fossils resemble tentacled organisms, and are thought to have fed by capturing prey. The frondose fossils resemble <b>sea</b> <b>pens</b> and other cnidarians. The trace fossils suggest that there were annelid type creatures, and the disk fossils resemble sponges. Despite these similarities, much of the identification is speculation since the fossils do not show very distinct structures. Other fossils do not resemble any known lineages.|$|E
25|$|Organisms {{living in}} the depths of Barkley Canyon have evolved to be able to persist in areas with high pressure, no light, and low nutrients/food availability. The Barkley Canyon {{instruments}} span a diversity of habitats, each of which is associated with its own specialized biological community. Most of the areas within Barkley Canon are characterised by a soft, finely sedimented seafloor. Video observations suggest that animal densities are higher at the shallower sites compared with the deeper sites, although most species are present at all sites. A number of fish including sablefish, thornyheads, rockfish, flatfish, sharks, skates, hagfish and eelpouts have been observed throughout Barkley Canyon. The area is rich with invertebrates as well including molluscs (bivalves, octopus, snails), echinoderms (sea stars, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, and urchins) as well as arthropods (crabs and shrimp). Cnidarians are seen both on the seafloor (anemones, <b>sea</b> <b>pens,</b> and corals) as well as floating in the water column (jellyfish) along with other organisms such as salps, ctenophores, and tunicates.|$|E

500|$|The {{link between}} certain frond-like Ediacarans and <b>sea</b> <b>pens</b> has been thrown into doubt by {{multiple}} lines of evidence; chiefly the derived {{nature of the}} most frond-like pennatulacean octocorals, their absence from the fossil record before the Tertiary, and the apparent cohesion between segments in Ediacaran frond-like organisms. Some researchers have suggested that an analysis of [...] "growth poles" [...] discredits the pennatulacean nature of Ediacaran fronds.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the most}} {{primitive}} eumetazoans—multi-cellular animals with tissues—are cnidarians, {{the first attempt}} to categorise these fossils designated them as jellyfish and <b>sea</b> <b>pens.</b> However, more recent discoveries have established {{that many of the}} circular forms formerly considered [...] "cnidarian medusa" [...] are actually holdfasts– sand-filled vesicles occurring {{at the base of the}} stem of upright frond-like Ediacarans. A notable example is the form known as Charniodiscus, a circular impression later found to be attached to the long 'stem' of a frond-like organism that now bears the name.|$|E
500|$|Many cnidarians {{are limited}} to shallow waters because they depend on endosymbiotic algae for much of their nutrients. The life cycles of most have polyp stages, which {{are limited to}} {{locations}} that offer stable substrates. Nevertheless, major cnidarian groups contain species that have escaped these limitations. Hydrozoans have a worldwide range: some, such as Hydra, live in freshwater; Obelia appears in the coastal waters of all the oceans; and Liriope can form large shoals near the surface in mid-ocean. Among anthozoans, a few scleractinian corals, <b>sea</b> <b>pens</b> and sea fans live in deep, cold waters, and some sea anemones inhabit polar seabeds while others live near hydrothermal vents over [...] below sea-level. Reef-building corals are limited to tropical seas between 30°N and 30°S with a maximum depth of , temperatures between [...] and [...] high salinity and low carbon dioxide levels. Stauromedusae, although usually classified as jellyfish, are stalked, sessile animals that live in cool to Arctic waters.|$|E

I). The camoufiage was so perfect that it was difficult at a casual glance to spot the crab, the general colour of which was whitish as that of the <b>sea</b> <b>pen.</b> while the carapace and chelipids had dark more or less symmetrically arranged spots, simulating to some extent the dark spots on the distal part and margin of the pinnules...|$|R

50|$|An {{attempt to}} release a captive orca back into the wild has only been {{conducted}} once - resulting in a partial success for Keiko, the star in the movie Free Willy. The Canadian and United States governments have also successfully released and reintegrated a rescued orca named A73, or Springer, a situation which bore certain similarities to that of Morgan. Springer, like Morgan, was found alone, many miles from where her family pod is resident and in an emaciated condition. After being kept in a <b>sea</b> <b>pen</b> in Puget Sound and nursed back to health, Springer was then transferred to a <b>sea</b> <b>pen</b> off of northern Vancouver Island from where she was ultimately released. She successfully reintegrated with a resident British Columbia orca pod and is still with that pod today.|$|R
