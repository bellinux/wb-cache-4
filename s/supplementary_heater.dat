2500|$|In all systems, a small <b>supplementary</b> <b>heater</b> {{increases}} {{personal security}} and reduces lifestyle impacts {{for a small}} reduction of autonomy. The two most popular heaters for ultra-high-efficiency houses are a small heat pump, which also provides air conditioning, or a central hydronic (radiator) air heater with water recirculating from the water heater. [...] Passivhaus designs usually integrate the heater with the ventilation system.|$|E
50|$|The outdoor {{section on}} some units may 'frost up' {{when there is}} {{sufficient}} moisture {{in the air and}} outdoor temperature is between 0 °C and 5 °C (32 °F to 41 °F). This restricts air flow across the outdoor coil. These units employ a defrost cycle where the system switches temporarily to 'cooling' mode to move heat from the home to the outdoor coil to melt the ice. This requires the <b>supplementary</b> <b>heater</b> (resistance electric or gas) to activate. The defrost cycle reduces the efficiency of the heat pump significantly, although the newer (demand) systems are more intelligent and need to defrost less. As temperatures drop below freezing the tendency for frosting of the outdoor section decreases due to reduced humidity in the air.|$|E
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis concerns the continued development and application of a computational model to simulate the thermal behaviour of internal combustion engines. The model provides information on temperature and heat flow distributions within the engine structure, and on temperatures of oil, coolant and engine-out exhaust gas. Sub-models calculate friction levels, fuel flow rates and gas-side heat transfer, including the effects of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), spark advance and turbocharging. The effects of auxiliary components such as a cabin heater, oil cooler, intercooler, <b>supplementary</b> <b>heater</b> and EGR cooler can also be simulated. Model developments are aligned towards improving the accessibility of the model and the scope of engine systems that can be simulated. Early versions of the model have been converted from 'C' into the current MATLAB/Simulink versions. The model structure and conversion process are described. New developments undertaken {{have focused on the}} external coolant circuit and include the modelling of the thermostat and radiator. A semi-empirical thermostat model is presented. A radiator model based on the effectiveness-NTU method is described. Simulations using the developed model, including the thermostat and radiator sub-models, investigate the effect of thermostat position on engine thermal behaviour. Positioning the thermostat on the inlet to the engine reduces thermal shock. Applications of the model to investigations of sensitivity and performance illustrate the accuracy of and confidence in model predictions. Assessments demonstrate that the model is relatively insensitive to variations of 100 / 0 in user inputs and is very sensitive to model assumptions if simulation conditions, implied in the model assumptions, are not matched to test conditions. A process for evaluating model performance is described. Evaluation exercises applied to three different engines demonstrate that values predicted by the model are to within 5 to 10 % of experimental values. Investigations using the model of methods to improve warm-up times and fuel consumption prior to fully warm conditions show the benefits or otherwise of reduced thermal capacity, an oil cooler, a sump oil heater and an oil-exhaust gas heat exchanger. Each method is assessed over the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC) from a - 10 °C start. Of these methods, a combined reduction in coolant volume and engine structural mass is most beneficial for reducing coolant warm-up times. An oil-exhaust gas heat exchanger produces the greatest reduction in fuel consumption. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Two Active Radiation Dosimeters (ARD's) flown on Spacelab 1, {{performed}} without {{fault and}} {{were returned to}} Space Science Laboratory, MSFC for recalibration. During the flight in December 1983, performance was monitored at the Huntsville Operations Center (HOSC). Despite some problems with the Shuttle data system handling the VFI, it could be established that the ARD's were operating normally. Postflight calibrations of both units determined that sensitivities were essentially unchanged from preflight values. Flight tapes were received for approximately 60 % of the flight {{and it appears that}} this is the total available. The next phase of effort will involve close collaboration with Space Science Laboratory, MSFC, in the analysis of this data. The Nuclear Radiation Monitor (NRM) was under assembly and testing at MSFC. Support was rendered in the areas of materials control and parts were supplied for the <b>supplementary</b> <b>heaters,</b> dome gas-venting device and photomultiplier tube housing. Performance characteristics of some flight-space photomultipliers were measured...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} Institute's work on {{transparent}} insulation, {{two different}} solar hot water systems have been investigated on the outdoor testfield in Freiburg during summer 1990. The results of performance tests of a transparently insulated collector storage were used for long term predictions. An annual system efficiency of 0. 35 with a yearly solar fraction of 0. 51 was calculated, assuming an absorber surface of 4. 2 m 2. Additional measurements showed, that the efficiency of a <b>supplementary</b> continous-flow gas <b>heater</b> varied between 0. 6 and 0. 8 according to the working mode of the burner. First experiments with a newly designed multi-effect solar still show the possibility of increasing the system's productive capacity {{by the use of}} transparent insulation. A higher system temperature and the efficient recovery of latent heat lead to a high production rate of desalinated water...|$|R
40|$|This patent {{describes}} an industrial {{process for the}} direct complete temperature induced transformation (decomposition and recrystallization) of packages of plastic material containing roofing cement-asbestos slates or other asbestos containing wastes such as friable asbestos. The industrial firing process ensures a complete transformation of both the package and the asbestos containing material via a decomposition reaction of the organic compounds and a decomposition and recrystallization of all the inorganic mineral phases including the asbestos minerals. The firing process which ensures the total transformation of the packages and the mineral assemblage including the asbestos phases is accomplished using an industrial continuous tunnel kiln, with a technology comparable to that employed {{for the production of}} bricks or sanitary-wares. The length of the industrial kiln should be within 100 and 150 m to guarantee the proper firing cycle and total decomposition and recrystallization of both the hazardous serpentine and amphibole species of asbestos. The transformation via decomposition and recrystallization of these minerals leads to the formation of non hazardous crystalline Si-, Ca-; Mg-rich silicates. To this aim, the steps of the firing cycle which are required are:Step 1 : a heating non-isothermal run up to the maximum firing temperature of 1200 - 1300 °C not shorter than 8 h;Step 2 : an isotherm at the maximum firing temperature of 1200 - 1300 °C not shorter than 12 h;Step 3 : a slow cooling non-isothermal run down to room temperature not shorter than 6 h. During the firing cycle, the industrial kiln must ensure complete isolation of the packages to be treated from the environment outside the kiln. All the volatile compounds and the asbestos fibres eventually released during the preliminary stage (Step 1) of the firing process inside the kiln will be conveyed to a post-combustion system (a <b>supplementary</b> <b>heater</b> {{at the top of the}} kiln) operating at temperature not lower than 1100 °C, to guarantee their complete thermal transformation and decomposition. The hot smokes and particulate from the post-combustor system will be successively cooled down to a temperature lower than 150 °C to allow the flow through double absolute HEPA filters before they are released in air. This industrial process is highly innovative and unique because it makes possible a safe direct thermal transformation of the packages containing the asbestos materials. The packages are not opened nor mechanically ground before the firing process. In this way, such pre-firing operations, highly dangerous because of possible dispersion of asbestos fibres in air, are avoided. The energy to the kiln will be supplied using natural gas. This industrial system will be capable to operate either with cement-asbestos sheets and friable asbestos and/or synthetic glass/wool fibers. As consequence of the thermal treatment, in agreement with the actual laws concerning the treatment and recycling of transformed asbestos containing wastes (see Table B Italian Minister Decree nr. 248, July 29 th 2004), the product of transformation, composed of a mixture of innocuous non-fibrous crystalline silicates can be milled and recycled as a raw material for the formulation of a number of different industrial products such as traditional ceramics, pigments, cements and bricks...|$|E
