40|$|We {{study how}} {{discount}} window policy affects {{the frequency of}} banking crises, the level of investment, and the scope for indeterminacy of equilibrium. Previous work has shown that providing costless liquidity through a discount window has mixed effects in terms of these criteria: It prevents episodes of high liquidity demand from causing crises but can lead to indeterminacy of <b>stationary</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and to inefficiently low levels of investment. We show how offering discount window loans at an above-market interest rate can be unambiguously beneficial. Such a policy generates a unique <b>stationary</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Banking crises occur with positive probability in this equilibrium {{and the level of}} investment is suboptimal, but a proper combination of discount window and monetary policies can make the welfare effects of these inefficiencies arbitrarily small.

When the central bank optimally chooses the size of the loan, it is shown that the resulting <b>stationary</b> <b>equilibrium</b> supports the economy's "golden rule" allocation. ...|$|R
